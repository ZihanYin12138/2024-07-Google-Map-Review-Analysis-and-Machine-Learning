<Review>So I got my nails dipped. Unfortunately, They didn’t push the cuticle back far enough before they started and here I am two days later and it already looks like it’s been growing for a week. I went back and talk to their manager and she said that’s how they do it because they don’t want to cut your cuticles and if she were to redo it they do have to soak it off and redo it again. Poor customer service. Poor workmanship. Go to KB nails on Fairoaks Boulevard you’re better off.< /Review>< Response>

<review>I have been to this place a couple times because it's conveniently close to my home, however I'm just not sure it is worth it. The first time I went they refused to give my 12 year old daughter a full set of nails because "They" thought she was too young. The next time they wouldn't help Me because all I had was a 50 dollar bill. Do they want business? During covid-19 can they afford to turn away business?< /review>< Rate>

<text>I love lucy, she has been doing my nails for 4 years. I drive 45 minutes just to go here and see lucy. She always does all the crazy designs I come up with. My mom loves jessica and tammy, because she has diabetes and needs to be extra careful for cuts, and they are so gentle. The wait is so worth it, but its never too long. I'm hard on nails and I never have any problems with breaking or chipping.</text>< Pictures>

I LOVE coming here! It had been a year since id come for a visit and Lisa made me feel awesome by welcoming me back and remembering very intimate details of my life. Plus i was given the best pedicure of my life and that was after being turned away by two other local shops that didnt have time for me. I definitely recommend this little nailshop💅😍< /Text>

They were really busy, which i understand it was a saturday. I was told to come back at a certain time which i did. I wanted a full set pink and white and my nail tech wanted to do dipped nails....which something i don't know much about so I was just wanting to stick to what i know.. so i had my feet done with gel polish and a full set and it took 3 hours..never in my life have i spent so much time having these two things done.<//text>

The women are friendly, efficient,
experienced, and make going there feel like you are in another world. They wait on you hand and
foot. If you are in a hurry they have two operaters servicing you.
The equipment is clean, sterilized before and after each customer.
If you ask they may bring tea coffee H20. I have back problems so they offer small pillows to tuck here and there.
I have gone 15 minutes before closing and without any hesitation they sit you down turn the massage chair on and get right to work. One doing the
mani the other the pedi but never
making me feel rushed. I can go here and feel like I spent the whole day at a spa. It makes me feel like a queen/princess when I leave. Toes with gauze btween
and cute little thongs on. They walk me to my vehicle help me inside and wave me on my way.
Just like family. Kudos to the great women there. Thank you so much.< /review>

Two visits were wonderful.  Third time very unlucky.  Person at front, running the place looked entirely annoyed that my two granddaughters and I had come in.  We should have left then.  She slammed down the box containing colours.
My experience withe manicurist was painful.  I have arthritis in my hands and I mentioned that the way she was twisting my fingers was painful.  To no avail  she kept it up.
My granddaughters were also not pleased<//review>

A very nice clean nail salon. They were extremely nice and there were lots of gel nail colors available to choose from. They also had plenty of employees. So you didn't feel like you would have to wait.  I just got a regular manicure with gel nail polish. The lady did a good job it was very even  and if I had a concern she listened and  took my suggestion. Also they have decent prices.<//review>

I do not recommend this place. Had appointment for daughter and I to have nails done same time. My mom was treating.  I was rushed to pick a color, after only given 30 seconds to decide. They took a walk-in ahead of me, even though that person didn't have a color chosen either. Didn't do my daughter and my nails at same time. They said because they had lots of walk-ons. But we had an appointment!!  I got Lucy who was incredibly rude the entire time working on me just so she could get to someone else she knew, which then she was all happy and nice to. Rushed me away and didn't even put the oil on my hands, which was done for everyone else. This was my mom's treat, and she had planned to give $10 tip to each person. I only allowed her to give $5 to Lucy, which she shouldn't have even got that. My mom is a regular, but I have a difficult time wanting to go back when I was treated so poorly, and for what reason? I was very nice and patient. My nails are ok, but honestly could have been done better. Instead of a relaxing experience, I felt so stressed and like I was an inconvenience. This was only the second time I had my nails done. The first was when I got married over 20 years ago. Much different experience, and not a good one.< /review>

Love this place a little pricy but good work I gave a 4 star because My nail fell off not even 24 hours later after a fill and it was a super big inconvenience as I was going out of town and they said they could fix it when I got back. Other then that I love this place< /review>

My friend went to this salon to get a full set of acrylics, and left in pain. She came back on the following day to get them removed. They tried to say they did not remember her, and they eventually agreed to remove them. They did not soak her nails to remove them, they ripped them off, dry, and completely destroyed her nails. If I could give no stars I would.< /text>

Went in with a friend for a fill. Told them I needed a fill. They didn't listen then chewed me out because a fill is different than a manicure. Then the lady tried to tell me I needed to new tips when the length is my natural nail. Didn't ask me any pertinent questions either. Then she was rough on my cuticles and rude. Never going back there.< /Review>

I came in 30 minutes before closing with my mom and we asked to make sure they could do both our feet and said we could come back tomorrow instead if needed. They told us it was fine and they'd service us, so we pick out our polish and get started. The girl who did my toes hurt my nail beds when she was scrapping the old gel off. After that she was rushing really quickly and digging under my nails way to deep hurting me once again. The she started to trim my toes when I told her just to file and shape. She trimmed my toes on one foot and filled the other foot for some reason. In her rushing my toes we're all filled/cut at angles instead of straight across like a normal pedi. The only thing that I did like here is they use sanitary liners in the bath each time and throw them out after use. If you don't have the time to take on a client who said they could come back the next day then just say so!< /Review>

Rude customer service, wont come back here ever again. Come in for pedicure and my wife for manicure and pedicure as well & nails.
Instead of cutting my nails at the corners she trying over and over pulling i tot i was going (DIE) to kick her i liter-lee luckily there was lots of people I only said WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING,  She capt on watching TV SHOW and talking to her coworker  as well as pulling corners of the nail.
When i got home i looked that few of the nails was filled with BLOOD and not even trimmed. BED SERVICE BED CUSTOMER SERVICE
My wife is very unhappy as well with everything they did.< /Review>

<text>Won't come back for a few reasons: nails are cheap and not worth what I paid, acrylic has large bubbles and now cracked after a day. Anyway I asked for fiberglass and was told by a young woman that worked there okay. she still gave me acrylic. She was not directly rude to me but didn't say a word to me unless I asked a question and hello you are doing my nails for 25 min I feel awkward when you are silent which I felt was rude.</text>< Pictures>

From start to finish, Denise made this process a great experience. I am first time home buyer and this is a new area for me. Denise helped make this a fast and smooth transaction, helping accelerate the closing process and impressing all stakeholders involved in the deal. Very much appreciate the professionalism, the transparency, and the stress free process. Thank you Denise & Team. You're truly awesome!<//Review>

<text>We just finished refinancing our home with Chris Collins working through Essex Mortgage.  Chris is an energetic  person who is very easy to work with.  He always explained answers to all of my questions in a clear and concise manner.  He also would get back to me very quickly when I called him.  He took his time to explain each step and made the refinancing very simple.  I always felt like he was looking out for us to get the best possible deal we could make.  I would highly recommend Chris Collins to anyone considering to refinance.  We love him!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Glenn and Denise did a fantastic job guiding us through our first home purchase. They were very thorough in answering our questions and their response times were nearly instant even on weekends when necessary. In retrospect I can't imagine what would have happened if we had gone with other lenders who took days if not weeks to answer questions! Everything was smooth sailing with Glenn and Denise and we highly recommend them for their experience and advice throughout the process. Thank you both!< /Text>

<text>Just had a fantastic experience with my recent closing with Dinese Nour at Essex Mortgage. She helped our first time home  buyer client in securing and funding the loan. She was very professional and communicative and on top of her game throughout the transaction. Initially we scheduled the closing for 30 days, she was able to fund and close the deal in 21 days. In our Real Estate Business, closing ahead of schedule is icing on the cake and win win for all. We really appreciate her professionalism dedication for excellence. Highly Recommended.

As first time homebuyers, Keith relayed the information to us in a clear, easy to understand step-by-step way. He was patient with all of our questions and was very detailed. Keith and his Team were quick to respond to our emails and phone calls even leading communication with the escrow company. Impeccable service!

George was fantastic. He was all over our file from start to finish. His communication was terrific with frequent updates. I had a more difficult file than most due to an untraditional income but George went out of his way on every aspect of this transaction to help me out. He not only knows the business extremely well but genuinely cares about his clients. I recommend using George Karacsonyi to anyone needing a loan.<//Text>

I have been working with Tammy for my mortgage needs for over 5 years now. I have bought 2 homes  and refinanced 3 x. Each and every experience was full of transparency, options, education, professionalism and a genuine feeling that she ultimately wants the best outcome for each and every client. I've learned something new every time I speak with her. she has the knowledge in this industry to lead anyone down the "right" path that's unique and best for them. I trust her! I will only use her for my mortgage financial needs.</Review>

Keith and his team did an excellent job from the beginning of our home buying process through closing. Keith communicated well with us regarding the different options and responded to our questions without delay. He went the extra step of communicating with our agent and also the seller's agent to make sure our bid was considered seriously during this competitive market.<//Text>

We were introduced to Bob Maldonado from Essex Mortgage a few years ago when we were buying our first home. Though it was a stressful time, Bob and his team answered all our questions and went out of their way to provide excellent customer service. Recently, we just refinance our house for the second time since the rates dropped. Bob and his team made the process painless. Every question we had was answered quickly. Bob Maldonado with Essex Mortgage is who we will turn to when we are ready to purchase our next home or perhaps refinance again.</review>

I recently refinanced my home loan with Essex Mortgage by utilizing the VA IRRRL program.  They gave me the lowest interest rate on the market at 2.25% fixed rate, 30 years fixed.  It lowered my monthly payment to $300 which amounts to thousands of dollars in savings for me and family.  Daniel Neal was our Mortgage Broker and he took care of our needs from day 1 until closing.  He was very attentive and answered all of my questions and concerns in a prompt manner.  He was very professional and courteous.  It took approximately 40 days to close on my refinance which beat the typical 45 day turnaround.  I highly recommend that anyone who needs assistance on mortgage related matters give Essex Mortgage a call; they will go above and beyond to meet your needs!  Thanks Daniel and Essex Mortgage.</review>

Elsa knows what she's doing, she's well familiar with the process. She kept us informed about the status of our loan and followed up regularly with any missing items for the approval. Elsa was very patient and communicated in a clear and professional manner. Highly recommend her for your home loan needs.< /text>

Troy Weatherly and his team helped us on the purchase of our home, and the refinance of our home . They go above and beyond to make the process easy for us . Felt like we had to do nothing at all . He is always there for us whenever we had questions, and broke everything down in simple terms we’d understand. He gave  us his personal   Advice, which always seemed sincere . They are Someone you can trust are looking for only the best for you , and to top it off , are just really nice people . I will always recommend Troy and his team to family and friends . And will go to them whenever I need advice on my home .<//text>

<Text>I've had the pleasure of working with Tom Queen recently for the purchase of my home.  I have probably purchased or refinanced a home about 10 times during my lifetime.  I can say without hesitation that Tom is the best that I've had the opportunity to work with.  Extremely knowledgeable and responsive.  We had a few delays due to the seller of the property and Tom did an excellent job navigating through all of them effortlessly.  I highly recommend Tom if you are looking for a purchase or refinance of your home.<//Text>< pictures>

Tom is a results driven, self-motivated and resourceful Mortgage Broker with an in depth understanding of all aspects of the mortgage process and actual implementation. I found him to be highly resourceful, flexible, innovative, and enthusiastic with in depth experience regarding the mortgage process from beginning to end. His excellent communication skills regardless of my endless questions are indeed outstanding and much appreciated.<//review>

<Review>I worked with Greg at Essex to do my VA IRRRL while I’m still on active duty at Camp Pendleton. The process was straightforward, Greg communicated and responded quickly and he made sure I understood what was happening during the whole process. He takes time to get to know you and ensure your needs are met, making my refinance one of my top customer service experiences of the year!<//Review><userid>115757495614785775685</userid><date>1609515516813<//date><gmapID>0x80dcd778dc5d19c9:0xf752b23a066c970e<//gmapID><Name>Gyrene</Name><response>None< /response></record>

Tom Queen is fast and efficient in getting your mortgage loan ready, set, and funded.  We did everything online except the final signing with a notary.  Tom will give you multiple options to help you figure out what is best for your loan situation needs.  I have used him for 20 years.</text>

Thank you, again, Tom Queen! There were three reasons I launched the mortgage process with you, rather than another banker who was referred to me. 1. Your referral source, my daughter's husband, is about the best, 2. The interest rate you mentioned was more competitive and 3. Your responsiveness & immediate rapport was fantastic. Now that we have completed the mortgage successfully, I can emphatically say yours has been the most competent, trustworthy, helpful and enjoyable mortgage process ever.</text>

From beginning to end, Greg was right there every step of the way, answering my questions, following up, and making me feel like I was a number one priority. It was awesome! I’m so happy with my refi.... thanks to Greg I got a terrific rate and my monthly mortgage went down. Five stars all the way!!< /Review>

<Text>My experience with Bob Maldonado at Essex Mortgage was very positive. My loan approval process went very smoothly.  This process went well because of the expertise and knowledge of Bob and Traci, his assistant.  I was very fortunate to be referred to Bob to help me buy my first house.  I highly recommend Bob to assist you in getting a loan to purchase your home.</Text>< Pics>

Tom Queen at Essex Mortgage uses his wealth of knowledge, combined with his kind patience and ability to translate the mortgage/refinance process to make the lay person like me comfortable with what would otherwise be an overwhelming process. We have done multiple re-finances over the years with Tom because we trust him implicitly. When you’re signing papers for a massive loan like a mortgage, trust is essential and a lifetime of experience in the industry is an asset.<//Review>

Mitch Olsen is a top notch mortgage writer. I have done 3 loans through him and our daughter has done 2. All 5 have gone through with out a hitch. He always has our best interest in mind, always gets us the best rate, but most of all he truly cares about his clients. You definitely can go wrong using him.

Thanks Mitch!<//text>

I had a very complex refinancing situation. I am retired and my income, though substantial, is almost totally dependent on rental income. Though that income has not wavered during these COVID times, nevertheless, the "underwriters" continued to require tons of documentation to verify the income. That requirement is reasonable, but then, after it took them several weeks to review rent logs, balance sheets, rental agreements, etc, they then wanted updated check registers, rental income records, etc., in case anything had changed in the past 3 weeks.
I was ready to quit the process altogether, but, Chris hung in there with me, calmed me when I was ranting, kept me encouraged that the loan would happen, and finally brought it home for me.

Ed is very knowledgeable and extremely pleasant to work with.  We would recommend him to others.  Happy sailing, Ed!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

< Review>
This is my second time working with Martin for my home loan. He was always available to answer my questions and really took the time to go over all my options to get the best possible loan. When It came time to close on the home Martin and his team got done ahead of schedule and we were able to close early. We could not be happier with the service and professionalism from Martin and Essex Mortgage.</Review>

<text>I don't know Greg McAree personally until he knocked on our door and offered his service to us. He was very pleasant and full of energy. You can easily tell how knowledgeable he is with regards to the housing market. Greg made the process very easy for us by taking the time to keep us up to date and keeping the line of communication open for us. He goes beyond his task to offer us a better experience. I'm grateful to have known Greg. We will definitely use his service again in the future.< /text>< username>

March of 2020 Essex acquired my loan. Since then I have yet to receive any information about it. I only know because, the Original mortgage company told me. I have had to make payments to the Original mortgage company because everytime I call I get forwarded to a voicemail. I leave the voicemail with a promise to call back within 24 hours. I have been calling since at least April. IT IS NOW JULY.</text>

Our loan was not at all easy by any means and with covid it was almost impossible. But wilda and Russ just kept at it. We were amazed at how hard they worked for us. Ive never seen anyone work so hard to get a deal done. They were relentless and didn't stop for anything. I would recommend them to everyone looking for a reverse mortgage. You will never find anybody that will work harder for you. Now they aren't just lenders they are our friends. I hope to stay in touch with them as friends. Thank you again Russ and Wilda.

Martin was Great! He walked us through the most important and stressful buying process of my life, to date, with patience, calmness, professionalism, knowledge, and friendliness throughout the whole endeavor. And ours,was not a simple one for him and all the many people involved in this process. There was past financial and credit damage on both buyers side, extra red tape with unusual family to family sale drama's and legal considerations and extra delicate attention needed, and Martin delivered all while making sure he got us the best rates on all fee's and always giving us free advice on pertinent matters to us easily and freely  because of his many years of experience.< /Text>

Their attention to our needs during our most recent refinancing needs was the best. Saudy was always available and quickly responded to our questions. Keith explained the loan process and different loan options to us right from the start of the loan in order for us to make the best choice and type of loan that best fit our needs.

We had the wonderful opportunity to work with Keith Murphy and Saudy Esparza for the refinance of our home.  Fantastic experience we highly recommend ESSEX MORTGAGE!  The dedication and customer service we received from Go Team Murphy is like no other company we have had the privilege of working with.  Interest Rate was great, escrow closed almost one week early, communication was outstanding but most of all the easiest refinance we have ever been through.  Thanks so much to Saudy and Keith they made us feel like family!<//text>

As one of the top Realtors in Las Vegas - I have access to any lender I would want to use. I picked Troy to ReFi one of my rentals, and he gave me the same great service and advice that he gives to all of my clients. 80% of them use Troy and for good reason!</Text>

The team is very responsive, professional, and easy to work with. The experience could have been much harder as getting a refinance is like buying a house. We are so glad we went with Essex Mortgage and went through with the refi.
Great experience!< /Text>

It turns out, getting a mortgage and buying a house is a complicated process - ha! Mesha helped us each step of the way - lots of work on her end - and we were successful! If she hadn't been the amazingly organized, diligent, and responsive loan officer that she is, we might have missed our window. But she kept us on track and we're currently moving into the home we hope to live in for the rest of our lives. Thank you Mesha!< /review>

<Text>This is the second time I have used Justin Abreu for my current home. It is so nice to work with someone who is open and honest. There is no hidden anything! Sometimes the loan process can seem stressful, but not at all when I work with Essex--- the process is quick and simple.
Essex runs your credit, you review and upload some documents and bam you are funded. Essex offered the best rate and by far the quickest closing time (others were quoting twice as long)! Both Justin and Laura were easy to reach and I could ask as many questions as I wanted.
I definitely recommend Essex to anyone who is buying a home or refinancing!< /Text>< Pictures>

As a real estate professional going on 24 years; it's very important to all parties in the real estate transaction to work with an EXPERIENCED, KNOWLEDGEABLE, and COMPETENT lending team. Mitch Olson and Team Essex Mortgage have GREAT communications skills, their pre-approvals are solid, they are knowledgeable about their loan products and service areas. They genuinely care about their clients. My sincere thanks. Tara M. Klaas - Real Estate Broker - Klaas Realty - Ely Nevada.<//Text>

<text>Spammers extraordinaire. I talked with the Las Vegas branch about a loan years ago and since then, they've been spamming me nonstop. After asking them to stop, and getting reassurances from Troy Weatherly that they would stop, I continue to get spam from them. Why would I ever do business again with a company that ignores laws that they find inconvenient like CAN-SPAM? It makes you wonder what other laws they willfully ignore...< /text><UserId.>118036563369330488627</UserId.>< Name>

Essex Mortgage helped us get into our house 3 years ago when we purchased it and has exceeded our expectations again on our recent refi.  They are an amazing group of people to work with!!!  Knowledgeable, and efficient.  I recommend them to everyone I meet that is looking to purchase or refi.<//Review>

This was my first time buying a house and using my VA loan. As a service member I naturally turned to USAA. However, I ran into an issue once I was the highest bidder on a house. The seller was hesitant to accept my offer because there was nothing to show that I was a worthy buyer. It wasn’t until Keith stepped in. He reacted quickly that day we met. He advised me and told me everything that needed to be done. The next day my offer was accepted! I am now a homeowner thanks to Keith. He also took the time to answer all my questions and explain them very well.<//review>

The ease of re-financing was beyond belief!  There was no stress involved.

We were notified when there were documents to review on line, sign and return.

Chris’s staff make it the simplest way to go whether financing or doing a re-fi.

If you haven’t talked to Essex Mortgage, you’re missing out.<//Review>

<Text>We highly recommend Frank Hawley and Essex Mortgage.  We have used Frank for both the purchase and refinance of our home.

Frank insured that we completely understood the process.  He got us the lowest interest rate possible(lowest of all offers), bringing our house payment down considerably.  We closed in a timely manner.  He kept us updated constantly,  and made sure we were comfortable throughout the process.  My husband and I would highly recommend Frank Hawley and Essex Mortgage for your home purchase/refinance needs.< /Text>< pictures>

He makes himself available to you with any questions anytime.  I love knowing hes watching out for our investment.  Thanks Fred for all you do!< /text>< pictures>

Fred was absolutely amazing. He went so far above and beyond there isn't enough space here to sign his praises. He helped me, my wife, and our newborn son get into our first home! As a first-time homebuyer I knew nothing and Fred took the time to answer all of my questions, countless emails, and phone calls. He was so responsive I swear he answered before I hit "send" most of the time. He worked seamlessly and flawlessly with the builder and my agent. I will be sending him all of my friends and family. If you are looking for an expert in the business - this is the guy. You will be in great hands.< /Text>

Highly recommend working with Chris Clements. From beginning to end, the whole process of buying our new home went smooth and fast. He gave great advice and multiple options on what we qualified for. We put an offer in on our new home on
June 8th, 2019 and closed on July 12, 2019🏠🎉👏🏾
Thank You Chris & Essex Mortgage! Job well done

Mesha approached me personally and analyzed my financial situation in 360 degree.  Since I am not a employee, my situation has been very complicated and challenging.  She, however, encouraged me to apply for mortage to purchase a house even when other bankers from big financial institutions discouraged me to buy a house.  She is a great helper to get through if you have complicated financical situation.  I highly recommend her.<//text>

This review is based on my experience with Christopher Collins. Beware of Chris Collins at Essex Mortgage. He is (in my opinion), rude, unprofessional, and sketchy in his business practice; lack of communication, changing of terms, and to top it all off very rude and unprofessional text messages when I decided not to go with him on a re-fi. I have never, ever experienced someone at petty as Chris Collins when I asked him to leave me alone. I could go on but I think the point is made. I would be concerned about dealing with any company that allows someone like Chris Collins to work for them.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Elsa Rodriguez has provided me with excellent care during my refinance. He took the time to explain me in detail about the implications that these types of processes bring, sometimes they become susceptible to entanglements. It was definitely in record time thanks to his agility in processing the necessary documents. Any questions I had were always available to answer my questions. Very grateful to have found such a professional, friendly and efficient person.
Thank you Elsita.

Elsa Rodriguez (NMLS # 314679) was prompt, knowledgeable and brought the uttermost trust in refinancing my mortgage. She kept the ball rolling faster than I could have possibly imagined. I had originally been apprehensive about the process based on past experiences but she thoroughly took the time to explain the minute details & was available every time I would have questions. Essex Mortgage is lucky to have such a hardworking individual working for them. Thank You for making the process stress-free, efficient & pleasant.

They used to be one of my favorite places to go for gorditas but for the last few times I have been very disappointed. The lady that takes orders is rude, speaks like if she's doing you a favor. They hardly put any stuffing in them ( literally one small piece of chicharron in my gordita smashed to make it look a little bigger than what it was ) and on top of that, they raised their prices again, but usually if the prices go up is to maintain the same food quality and this is not the case. I'm very sorry, but they lost a good faithful customer. I know everyone has their days so I never complained to them,  but gave them a few more chances but service and quality of food is still 👎 so I'll just leave my opinion here and go elsewhere. With so many Gordita places, they need to step up their game cuz I've seen their competitors and have way more clients than them.< /text>

<Text>I’ve been coming to this truck since 2007, for good reason. The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious! The menu has expanded over the years and they offer something for everyone no matter your taste. I recommend the green chili and potatoe, but the napales and eggs is also bomb. They take card so if you don’t have cash no need to worry. Check this place out, seriously!!!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80905351791e1fc7:0xfb4f95d8ffe31088< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They were having a bad day today I guess. We show up on Sunday morning for breakfast. They already have many orders taken but their tables and eating area is filthy. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for 4 gorditas. The gorditas were so dry. They didn't even have lemon or lime for them. I'm disappointed by their service. If they are short people or know people will be waiting over 30 minutes for their food, they should tell people as they order. Instead they continued taking order after order. At one point the people sitting around us joked that there was no one eating at this place. We were literally all waiting. I hope this doesn't continue to happen. Next time, I think I'll try the gordita place across from them. Maybe they will have better service.<//Review>

We hope you will come back on another day and let us show you a different side. Lunch is on us next time since we failed you today. Today we had many more customers than we normally do and we actually did start turning customers down about noon because the wait times got over 60 minutes and the only way to catch up was stop taking orders and help in the kitchen. Surprisingly many customers were still willing to wait.\n\nWe take great pride in our service and cleanliness. Unfortunately we are in need of help and are currently hiring. If you know anyone please refer them to us and help get that service up to standards.\nThank you for helping by letting us know how we can improve. we wish you'll visit us again so we can earn those stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟."}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80905351791e1fc7:0xfb4f95d8ffe31088< /gmap_id></record>

When we were finally seen, the room was so dirty that I wouldn’t even take my pet here for medical services.

They're pretty professional here. Got my covid test here and did not take long at all. The girl at the front desk is real pretty lol. That always helps. Interesting clientele though for sure. 🤣🤣< /review>

<review>i had a 1:30 appointment for my covid vaccine. waited over an hour and then canceled my appointment. so many people were waiting outside as well. DO NOT GO HERE!! there are so many other places that will get you in and out within 20 min max. it was insanity, a waste of time.< /review>< pictures>

<text>I've read the other reviews. Some people have had a bad experience here. Don't know what that's about. I've been here a few times for myself and other family members. Always been seen quickly. The staff has always been friendly, kind and professional. Never felt I was given bad service. They take a variety of insurance including Medi-Cal/Care. Its a great option if you can avoid the E.R.</text>< Pics>

<review>Long wait due to social distancing but once inside we were seen quickly.  My son had cut his finger.  The medical professionals reassured him and cleaned his wound before giving him stitches.  Upon return for stich removal everything went smoothly.  We were given great instructions which we followed and his finger healed well with no infection.  I recommend this office and will drive past other places to get here.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Went in November and asked the receptionist if I was In-Network and covered under my insurance. They told me yes and I would only have to pay my deductible. I got my Blue Cross statement stating I owed 226$ a week later however I never got a bill. I called my insurance and they said I was out of network and could file a claim. I tried to contact the urgent care and billing for 3 months straight with zero responses to my calls or emails. Finally after 3 months I got the bill and I took it into the urgent care. They told me there was nothing they could do. I ended up having to pay the full amount because the receptionist ran a false check on my insurance and told me I was In-Network and that I’d be only paying my deductible. I would advise not going here as I was lied to about my insurance coverage.</Review>

<Review>If I could rate -5 I would.  This place is so unorganized and the Hispanic woman at the front desk is horribly rude and unprofessional.  I made an appointment for 2:36 on 3/1/21. I checked it on time and they kept me waiting over 3 hours while letting tons of well people ahead to get covid vaccines.  When I complained (a few times) about the wait, the receptionist argued with me stating that I wasn't there at 2:30 and didn't appreciate MY attitude.  Needless to say I went off. I didn't get to get a script for antibiotics that I came for. I  will NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!  They shouldn't be in business.</Review>< Pics>

Sick .. ugh gotta get a COVID test. Was directed to Urgent Care Now. Went online, made an appointment - instantly. Received a text that would remind me to leave and would save my place in line. Received a text confirmation. Upon arrival (and I was warmly greeted with a SMILE) the kiosk check-in was fabulous. Waited less than 10 minutes. Was tested and given a slip of paper to go online to get my results in a few days. .....THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. BEST SERVICE I’VE RECEIVED IN A VERY LONG TIME. I asked them if they would be willing to refill my prescriptions. I recently lost my job and health benefits due to COVID. THEY REFILLED MY PRESCRIPTIONS TOO AND SENT ME ON MY WAY. WHOLE EXPERIENCE TOOK LESS THAN 30 minutes. Sick? Go to Urgent Care Now on Fair Oaks and Greenback. They are THE BEST.< /Review>

Very bad service terrible experience and the waiting time is not accurate. I checked in at 1:45 with approximate time 30 minutes but they held me till 5:00 besides when I spoke to the doctor she was rude and not friendly at all. I would not recommend this clinic to anyone at all.<//text>

I have been here a few times. Ive brought my 6 year old son and myself a few times. For Urgent Cares that take medi-cal, this one is top notch. Of all the times ive been here there was one single time that i waited longer than 30 mins. One time i waited 4 hours and i STILL recieved great treatment then. The staff is wonderful. The office is clean. All around wonderful place to visit if you dont want to hit the ER.< /text>

<Review>Super spreader event anyone? Went in for the vaccine and they had around 25 people crammed into the waiting room with another 15 outside the door all standing waiting for paperwork. Covid test patients  mixed in with vaccines patients. Staff was terrible about letting everyone know what was going on. I witnessed one of the staff  (male with a ponytail) rudely exchange words with a patient then walk away as the guy was asking him a question. They seem to be in over their head.<//Review>< Pictures>

Well, I just went of the 18th this month.  I walked out with good results.  Yet, still not able to get a hold of anyone to ck my Covid results?   could someone please send me the email to ck.?  had no idea that would be how I am to find out?  until I left visit.  Other than that, Tracy, the FNP was ok, and her assistances are cute as buttons.  Very personable.  especially the one little 23 yr old soon to be married, and the person she was training radiology. Chest Exrays.....thank you for all you do there, with all the caos outdoors.  Deborah<//text>

I have been sitting here for about two hours now waiting for my X-ray, but I keep being told 10 more minutes. I’m in extreme pain and not one person has checked on me. There is a blonde lady doing X-rays and told me she would come get me after the X-ray was done for another patient and yet she comes out and forgot about me and called someone else. I DO NOT RECOMMEND COMING HERE!!!!</Text>

<Review>Yesterday was my third time having to have a COVID-19 test, this was my third location as well. The last time I tested, the  facility I visited was a hot mess very unorganized and I had to wait three hours just to test. I decided to try urgent care now as it was close to my home and they allowed you to make appointments right through their website. I easily made my appointment and 15 minutes prior to my appointment time I received a text to arrive shortly. Once I arrived I checked in on their easy tablet. Then I was called up to the front desk and manually checked-in with my insurance this was also very easy fast and super friendly! Then I was called into my swab within 15 minutes. I knew how long I had to wait because they also have a huge monitor that shows your name and approximate wait time upon you arrival. After my swab and I awaiting the arrival of the nurse practitioner who was also extremely friendly and informative, I told her while I waited for her I added the LabCorp app to my phone so I can easily get my results as soon as they come in. They even have little pieces of paper with all the information on how to do that laying all over the office. You don’t have to wait for their call as soon as the results are in you will know if you use this app and it’s free! Thank you for such a wonderful stress-free process and thank you to the staff who are working tirelessly to help each and  every person as fast as they possibly can! My advice, read their website, checkin online to secure an appointment time, and create  an account through the app so you don’t have to wait for anything! If you are a walk-in of course you have to wait while people who made appointments are seen first! Also a little kindness goes a long way I think we can all appreciate that!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

One star because it was bad! I have been calling for my prescription.. They didn't send it to my pharmacy.
Plus the lady working in the front (nurse) she was rude to me. She look hispanic with curly hair. I think she doesn't like her job.</Review>

Got a COVID test here. I didn't have to wait long to get it done. They send their samples to LabCorp. Its been 13 days since I got my test and my results never showed up on the LabCorp website. Called the urgent care and they've had the results for over a week now. If your results don't show up online within a few days, call the urgent care to see if they have them.</review>

I was seen by kristen a Nurse Practitioner there at urgent care. She was an absolute pleasure to be seen by. She was thorough, she was patient with all of my fiance's questions and all together just had a contagiously positive attitude while being very professional and highly educated. This was the second time ive been seen by her and its always the same.

I have also been seen by another NP as well, she too was great to be seen by. The staff there is really good they keep it light hearted so ur time there isnt so much of a bummer. All in all a dope place to be seen. You will feel better walking out than u did walking in.< /Text>

<review>Had appointment for vaccine and waited over an hour. At 9am! That’s how disorganized they are. And they didn’t give me a vaccine card either. This place is terrible.<//review>< Pics>

Pretty fast! The people are really nice and make you feel at ease. Great change from spending 7 hours in the emergency room.<//Text>< pictures>

The doctors and staff are very nice, and were great to deal with. Wait time was average and service was prompt.

One star because of what came after. I had to pay out of pocket because my insurance hadn't kicked in yet, which was fine, I needed the care. They asked me if I was okay with the cost of what they were doing before they did it, I said yes, it was okay. I was happy with the final cost, wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting.

However, several weeks later I received a bill in the mail because they "misquoted" the original price and I still owed them money. I was NOT okay with that. If you're going to quote a price, make sure it's the right one. And if you're wrong, then HONOR THE ORIGINAL PRICE.

I was going to dispute it, but I didn't have the time and decided, I'd just pay. So I did. And then I kept receiving the same bill over and over, even though the money was withdrawn from my account using the check I sent, and now I've received a collection notice.

So not only did they misquote the price, send me a bill, take my money, but now they say I haven't paid so they're sending a collection agency for it? Definitely not OK.

I am NEVER using this place again. And I suggest that if you don't have insurance, don't go here.< /text>

I went in because I have a huge sore on my chest that hurts immensely. I was turned away by the lady at the front desk because I didn’t have a mask. Even though this is an urgent care, they don’t have masks to provide to their patients. Terrible service and the lady at the front desk was very rude. DO NOT GO HERE.< /review>

<Text>Always super helpful. Knowledgeable PAs.  Matt is super awesome and thorough when making sure all needs are met.  Ashley at the front desk is always so sweet and helpful.  I drive 35 min just to come to this location because of the people. Very clean and they always do what they say they are going to do. Wish they would open i regular office and be my primary care! Sometimes there is a wait (but that’s anywhere) but you have the option to check in and leave if you want. Which is super convenient.<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

I came in with a minor ailment and was out the door in no time at all. Tracy, my physician, was amazing. She did not rush through her examination, and was warmly attentive in her interactions with me. In other words, amazing bed-side manner. Tracy is my new favorite doctor in Sacramento!!!<//review>

I'm so glad that I came across this urgent care. I haven't needed any sort of urgent care in a long time. I had to give it a try. I am extremely happy about my whole experience even though I was worried about my health. The whole staff treated me so well. The front desk, to the medical assistant, then to the doctor. They were all so kind, helpful, and completely transparent with me. Wonderful place. Wonderful staff. 10/10. Would definitely recommend.< /review>

Hands down the best urgent care I have ever been too honestly probably the best medical care professionals. We arrived at 11:34am this morning and we're greeted by the receptionist I believe her name was Ashley. She was extremely helpful and very friendly which made the whole experience great even for the circumstance of my daughter not feeling well. Once we were taken back the amazing atmosphere continued with everyone who helped us even the ones who didn't were super friendly. We were out at 12:15pm couldnt believe how easy they made it for us. My family and I just moved to the area and this will definitely be our go to place for the kids and ourselves.< /text>

Staff is friendly and the wait is usually acceptable.  They even have a nifty online check in system now where you can essentially register for an appointment and wait all from home. They will alert you via text 20 minutes before you can be seen.  Takes sitting in a crowded lobby filled with sick people.<//Review>

<Text>Good PA's and staff. Wait times can be long, but not unreasonable. It's first-come-first-serve, so don't put off your visit. Staff has always been friendly, competent and do their best to deliver quality care. Better than most emergency rooms around here for simple medical needs. They take most insurance too.< /Text><gmapID>0x809ade27575c5131:0x6464319897b45f61<//gmapID><user>104663704409511329326< /user>< Rating>

Unfortunately my experience was negative. My 3 year old daughter needed immediate attention and she did not get seen there at all. Somehow the system they've used showed that she has no medical insurance. I have called medical twice ehile there and both time they've confirmed that there is coverage and no hold at all. End up taking her to ER and when there specifically asked them to print me a copy of her eligibility and at their copy it did say that she has coverage. I'm  not sure what website urgent care was using but they kept pulling wrong information or they've entered the information wrong, I don't know. In addition to that the front desk staff was not polite, my 3 year old daughter came in 3 min. before opening time because the door was unlocked and they've rudely sent us out and said that we have to wait for THREE minutes outside... REALLY??!!<//Review>

3 1/2 hours now. They keep lying and saying I'm next. There is nothing that they sre capable of doing that should take more than 15 minutes per patient. If they are understaffed, then hire some help, or get out of the business. My HMO will be getting an earful about this sad sack of a fraud!

Update: 4 1/2 hours is how long I was there. Unacceptable!< /Text>

Very bad service and the waiting time is not accurate. I checked in at 1:30 with approximate time 1 hour but they held me till 5:40 besides that my number was 1 and reception blond lady wearing reading glass told me I’m the next but she called someone else instead and when I spoke to her she was rude and not friendly at all. The clinic smell so so stinky
I would not recommend this clinic to anyone at all< /review>

I get the best care there! Much better than at my doctors office. My regular doctor would not prescribe antibiotics for sinus infection..in turn I ended up with horrible pain on both sides of my head...both ears popped then started to bleed..they bled for months..my ears would pop then blood ran out of ear..I told my dr I get very bad congestion and need the antibiotics at a certain point. My reg dr also again I told her I was dragging..def fighting something off...again she said she didnt like to prescribe antibiotics...I said I understand but I know I have an infection..well..went to Urgent Care Now..it was 3-6 days after my reg dr visit..I was sick!! No clue what was going on..I had been vomiting for 5-6 days.. Violently..got a ride there..they checked me out...then they called hosp..and told them I was coming in thru emergency room..got admitted and had immediate gall bladder removal...in hosp 6 days on antibiotics and antifungal medicine...my gall bladder was gangreous...( gangrene) and it was in pieces..rotten...thank God for Urgent Care Now because my dr said I was fine...no temperature and slightly elevated white blood count. The surgeon at hosp said..with infections like I had you dont necessarily have temp or a raised white count.
My dr said I didn't need antibiotics for every little problem that made me feel tired or no energy!!!
I think she thinks I am a hypochondriac!!! Sheesh!! Gangrene blood poisoning...is not minor problem!!
Exploding eardrums!! Painful!! The continuous bleeding on and off for months!!
I love Urgent Care Now because they listen to the patients..really listen..plus they are nice friendly professional and it's usually less time with a drop in there..than with appointment with my dr can take up to 2hrs wait.
Obviously I need to find a new dr that takes my insurance...would love to find one as good as the drs and nurse practioners there!!! Thank you all!! Pretty sure you saved my life!!!

<Review>Really simple process. Go online (or walk in), select an available time, show up 10 minutes early, fill out paperwork, pay the co-pay and get seen a few minutes later. Was seen by Jackelynn, a Family Nurse Practitioner and it was a quick and simple diagnosis. In and out in about one hour. One of the easiest medical appointments I've ever had. Great place for urgent care.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I was on vacation in California and had an infection develop on my leg. They were quick to see me, give me a diagnosis and proper treatment. By far the best urgent care I have ever been to.</Text>

< Review>
I have to say, this may have been my best experience at any urgent care EVER. . I brought my 3yr old son in after he fell at a park, busting his little chin open. . I took him home first, cleaned it up and seen that he would definitely need some stitches.  . After being through this with my older son, I knew it wasnt going to be easy for my kid or myself. . Ashley was AMAZING and so patient with my boy. . He talked to her like he knew her his entire life because she was so talkative with him! Deborah the dr was awesome as well! So patient and she explained everything to my son so he wouldn't be too surprised.  . Both ladies made our experience much better than I ever expected.  . Ashley gave my son a popsicle after he was done and even gave my daughters a popsicle too!! Great job to these ladies!!! 😊😊😊😊< /Review>

Used to be somewhat decent here in previous visits but they changed staff and since the ignorant and rude staff make this place stink, not using the services from this facility any longer. By the way they don't have doctors there, only PA, place is mostly worthless besides going there for something simple, with the staff that work there now I don't recommend going there at all stay away from this awful place.</Review>

I was advised BEFORE I went in they could help me but Nurse Practitioner Debra was unwilling to do the right thing! 2 days later my issue was still present. I called and got the scripted "nothing we can do for you" speech. I was very explicit about needing a specific procedure to which I was assured they could and would perform but Debra did nothing. I called and Debra told a staffer to tell me too bad, go to ER then. This site is only good for minimal care needs i.e., coughs colds minor sprains - basic stuff. They suck big-time.

extremely long wait, over one hour out front aftet paperwork submitted, front desk person clearly burned out, then claimed couldn't find my private ppo insurance (altho just used 4 days ago/same month) so had to pay out of pocket- once in patient room, waited another 35 min, & no physician, after all this, just one nurse practitioner. nothing against NP, as long as physician on site. BEWARE absolutely WORST urgent care have EVER been to.
Go to Roseville. Far more professional, caring, with Dr.< /Text>

Got there one minute before closing, and they stayed 45 min to stitch up my finger. They were very nice and didn't make me feel rushed so they could close. The stitches look great. Very pleased, especially since it's my first experience needing stitches!<//Review>

First time here, went in for a simple prescription refill. I am from out of town and could not get in to a local doctor until July. The staff for the most part were nice and friendly, However the Nurse practitioner Tracy was very rude. She came into the room and had an attitude about her, despite me telling her my situation she acted like she did not believe me. Tracy was rude and dismissive and i would not recommend coming here. Her attitude ruined the whole experience.<//review>

Unfortunately my son's are all boy, and tend to need care a lot. We were referred by a friend who said this place was great, and he was right. The staff took great care of my son when he needed stitches,  and when my boys had strep throat he was able to dagnose them and prescribe med within 30min. Very clean, and affordable.</text>

<text>DOCTOR referred me to go to emergency without seeing her (just walk by after going to the bathroom).  Urine test at emergency was clear.  Big waste of total time 10 hrs!< /text>< pics>

The girl said she had done many ear cleanings. I only needed one done; but they managed to clog the other one. They couldn't clear one ear; which is a first for me. They sent me out quickly with ear drops prescription and said I had an ear infection in both ears. I can barely hear out of both ears now. Guess I'll mention it to the person thinking about hiring me; I wonder what my chances will be????? Oh yeah; they were professional other than that; lol.< /Text>< Pictures>

The most frustrating thing about them is that they are IN-NETWORK with my insurance, but I constantly get a bill from them. Not sure if it's my insurances fault or theirs because they each blame the other, but I avoid going there because it always means a fight with both their office and my insurance once the bill comes. Plus, I won't get into the nasty details, but they for sure misdiagnosed me on one visit.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

First off I don't know how they got such a good review. Front desk kinda rude.... and if you are not insured they don't do anything for you here.. just take your money and tell u to see your primary Dr. Which they know you don't have...They printed off some paper off internet for discharge papers. That I could have done myself..< /Text>

<response>None</response><Text>There billing is the worst. Staff are friendly but obviously don't know what they're doing. First visit was to get  bloodwork which took them more than 1 attempt which is whatever. But second visit my boyfriend and I went in, he had cellutits on his calf and was given an intramuscular shot of rocephin in the gluteus which caused him lots of pain for months, not good. Staff at the front told us they would let us know prior to any procedure the cost but this never happened. No paper work was given to him approving any charges for this shot which later on he gets a bill on the mail. Then couple months later I get a letter from collections for myself, so I have medi-cal as my insurance which apparently was not active. So they saw me twice, you would think they would tell me they can't see me the second time and let me know I have to pay for my first visit but no they went ahead and still saw me. I use to work at a urgent care and first thing prior to seeing any patient is to make sure they're insurance is active, common sense. Anyways I called couple days ago and apparently I needed a referral from my primary care prior to being seen which I was never told about and does not make any sense. Then what is the point of an urgent care? So it's 4 days and I have not had a call from them. I guess it takes a long time to look into this and figure out that it is against the law to Bill a medi-cal patient and they could expect a big fine if they're doing this to a lot people which I am sure they are. This urgenr care is all about money and taking advantage of people.</Text>< Date>

Terrible experience. Waste of money. Receptionist is was very nice and polite, but doctor was terrible. I came with stomach pain which is still exist! She said I don't know what's that and gave me prescription for pills that helps remove heartburn. What's wrong with you??

After girl from pharmacy confirmed my suspicion about this urgent care. She said that I'm not first who comes without diagnosis for random drug that will not help.</Text>

< Review>
Walked in and was about to pass out. So they take me back to a room immediately to lay down. Lack of oxygen made it so I got lightheaded and dizzy. I mention that my whole issue started with a migraine. So that ended up being the main focus of the physician that saw me. The real issue was that I wasn't getting enough oxygen and had low blood sugar. But it was all about the dynamics of my face. How one eye sagged more than the other. (I heard about that 20 years ago) Seriously, 10 minutes of her trying to read me face. And I tell the chick about the stuff I've been through in the last year like divorce, child custody, ridiculous car issuses with repair and reg. Her diagnoisis for me? Depression and anxiety. And that I need to handle the migrains. Which I've only maybe had one in over 2 years. So, I'm probably in for some ridiculous respiratory infection, bronchitis, or pneumonia because it wasn't addressed. She listened to my breathing with her stethoscope over a sweater, a shirt and a tank top. She barely listened because I couldn't catch my breath. Don't get me wrong. She was super sweet. But she couldn't cure my issues with her sweetness and symapthy no matter how hard she tried. I had to wait in the front office area after for about 20 minutes, while I was clamy and pale, to get my paperwork and prescriptions and then felt rushed out once I was done. So here I am coughing up the green "there doesn't seem to be an issue" stuff, hoping I can sleep without reminding myself to breathe, and hoping that my simple diagnosis of "depression and anxiety" will keep me from choking on my own fluids. I shouldn't have started out with the migraine comment. I'm more worried about a serious lung infection issue. (I ended up having pneumonia and had to stay in the hopital for 8 days!)<//Review>

Came out here around 1 o clock and got a prescription a few hours later. Went to the pharmacy and realized they didn't send it electronically so I went back and got a physical prescription. Took it to the pharmacy and it turns out they forgot three of the items on the list. Thanks for wasting my gas and time urgent care. If you want to return here three times after they release you by all means this is the place to go.<//Text>

<user>106848930583470775249<//user><text>I priced 3 different walk in clinics between Carmichael and Orangevale and each wanted $125-$140 for a walk in appointment.

At the time, I had no insurance.

I called this Urgent Care and they charged just $75

That isn't even the most important thing...

The staff from the front desk to the doctors was courteous, professional friendly even on a day when their coffee machine decided to stop working.

Doctor was awesome.  Wait time was reasonable.

I got my care and meds and was on my way.

Doctor made a follow-up call 2 days later and I was impressed.  I've had family doctors who were less attentive.

My eye infection healed.

Next month, I got Blue Cross PPO insurance and an ear infection (no correlation I don't think...) and guess where I went without a blink? YEPPP! THIS PLACE.

Same great service, meds, infection gone.

I have visited this medical office yesterday at 8:20pm and got my prescription for the antibiotics then I headed to CVS at Dewey. They didn’t find the prescription from the doctor but this urgent care says they already sent it to that pharmacy. 1*. Never go there, I’m still waiting for my prescription with 100.5°F fever.<//Review>

Sunny and clean city park with a nice lawn, dog area and a small beach! I passed by the park during a run along the coast and enjoyed a little stop in this beautiful park. There are some picnic tables in the park which is awesome but otherwise there aren't a lot of facilities in the park so I think it has some potentials to be more interesting.
The neighborhood feels modern and urban, has plenty of restaurants and cafes within a short walk.< /text>

Nice little piece of history. Thanks to COVID-19, there's hardly anyone there. Cute little beach, though I wouldn't go into the water. Picnic tables, large grassy area, and historical cranes decorate this area. Sorry, I refuse to refer to any place as a park unless there's a water fountain.<//Text>

It's a fine example of revitalizing a public resource to reflect the times of the neighborhood. Little beach for kids - yes, in the bay water - and to launch a small boat like a kayak. Picnic table all occupied. Dogs running in their grass area. Something for everyone. Go check it out for yourself.< /text>< pics>

This is now one of my favorite parks in SF. It’s unique in that it has a big green area, a small beach (where you can kayak and rent paddle boards), and some cool shipyard relics paying homage to the area’s shipping/industrial history. Lots of cafes/food options within walking distance. Something for everyone.< /Text>

Lovely park for families, dogs, everyone. You can wade in the bay or canoe. The cranes and equipment are fascinating. Lots of care and detail went into this park and it shows. There is a cool restaurant and bar nearby and others within walking distance.<//review>

Dope space. The view, landscape, and functionality is on hit. I hope there are plans to expand. I gave only four stars due to there not being enough signage regarding keeping dogs on leash. SF dog owners are the worse. Also, there isxa need for some enforcement agency to periodically (especially during peak dog times) to patrol the area, and ticket horrible dog owners allowing their dogs; being off leash, crapping all over the space, ensuring the homeless do not wreck the joint.< /Review>

Love what they've done with the area. Seamless integration of green within an urban environment. Plenty of open space and picnic seating areas for groups. It's not 5 stars because it would've been ideal if they had either a dedicated dog area or some play structures for kids (or both!)< /text>

A small park very close to office.  Great for taking lunch break.  Nice views of the bay bridge and Oakland.  Can see a corner of the new Chase Center.  Only temp downside is construction and dust on the south side.<//Review>

Great new spot in the city. Places to walk around, clean and new. It’s not big by any means but it’s an adorable little park in the middle of this neighborhood.< /Text>

<review>Interesting new park in a cool post-industrial setting where you can actually go in the water if you wish.  There’s an unusual large old shipbuilding slip and preserved specimens of equipment from the famous Union Iron Works.  There are several large lawns and a rocky beach with decent access.  It would be nice if Google maps got its act together and spelled it right and showed it on the map!  (PS looked like they fixed the name but the map still doesn't show the park area)<//review>< Pictures>

Great new park. Definitely already discovered by many. Good place to bring a small child to run around on the grass, ride a small bike, or play in the bay. Good place to get your feet wet or short paddle board. Parking is tough, so go early.<//Text>

A wonderful addition to the bayside waterfront. A  beach, wading (popular with little kids), kayak and small watercraft launching, a gassy field, picnic area, historical artifacts to explore (old dock crane, etc.), port-o-potties.
Signs remind visitors that wading is ok but swimming isn't allowed, dogs should be on leash, and there can be a high bacteria count in the water.<//Text>

< Review>
A nice new park with a little beach (wading only, no swimming), a smaller lawn next to the beach, and a larger lawn further away with picnic tables.

It has some structures representing the area past and giving it industrial feel.

They ran out of money to build parts of the park (dog area and playground). I think there is a fundraising for those now and maybe they will be added in the future.</Review>

<Review>We are really happy this opened in the neighborhood; it’s clean, scenic, has picnic benches and tables and a great fit for families, kids, dogs. Also props to the urban designers for embracing SF’s past. Instead of tearing down or reworking some of the historical pier structure, they left it around for a really interesting backdrop.</Review><rate>5<//rate>< UserId.>

<Text>Lovely to have beach water access on the bay side of town. The kids loved splashing around (swimming prohibited), there's also lawn area for sitting, and some paved straightaways, should be good for biking/scooting. Although fully man-made, was awfully uncomfortably rocky and sharp to walk on, they could have found some nicer sand to lay. Couldn't tell if there's a parking lot, but we found some spots on Illinois at 18th.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Kerry McGuire</username></record></dataset><record>

The park itself is nice, and having a (small) beach in this part of town is very enjoyable. It’s still missing food/drink options immediately nearby however (there are options but a couple blocks away) and a playground for kids is sorely missing, although seems like there is space for it later maybe.< /text>

<date>1607644778190<//date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Just a charming little park for locals.  The key feature of this park is that you can wade into the water and launch engineless seacraft like paddleboards. Best park in the area.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Fantastic new park in Dogpatch, just down the street from the new Chase Center. It features a small cove for Standup Paddleboarding (SUP) and kayaking with a lovely little beach. There's plenty of space for picnicking and from to play. Great for dogs and kids alike. Even has some historical artifacts from the shipyard dock here previously.

Currently has three porta potties for bathrooms, unclear if they'll add proper restrooms in the future.

No dedicated parking, but plenty of street parking along Illinois. Just read parking signs carefully, especially during game days or events.<//Review>< pictures>

Aside from being friendly and safe in their covid procedures I just got one of the worst haircuts ever. Wasn't expecting a barbershop type quality fade or anything, especially asking for a high and tight. Idk what this is but I had to say it was fine so she didn't ruin it any further. 3 stars from my experience here (2 visits) and 0 stars for the cut....yikes.<//Text>

<text>I was excited to get my son's haircut to start school day fresh. I was thinking it's worth the price I'm sure there professionals. I paid $18 dollars for a fade that they said they couldn't line up his hair in front and couldn't do line ups on the sides either. I did not say anything I just paid oh well what was done was done they messed up my kids exciting day for school I could of done a better job probably or even an $8 dollar hair cut place. Because that's what it was worth $8 dollar hair cut</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

$24 for a haircut is expensive. Plus add a tip. I usually get a haircut(Hairisma on Miramar Rd) for $8 . So basically 3x the usual price for haircut. Nothing special that my usual hair cutter does at hairisma.</text>

<review>I recently went in for a trim for my already shot hair. I specifically asked the stylist NOT to cut the top and back, as it was already short and I only wanted the area around my neck and ears trimmed. I mentioned this more than once. She talked and cut and cut and cut. The result is an extremely short cut over my entire head. It’s as if she did the opposite of what I explicitly requested. I am VERY dissatisfied and feel awful about this horrible haircut. I couldn’t have been more clear with my request. I will never go back. I want to hide until my hair grows!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Sometimes they’ll have good ladies but trust me if you get someone that doesn’t seem like they know what they’re doing, they don’t. I asked for a few inches off the top and like a 2 on the sides and for some reason she decided to make her own terrible haircut on my head, stay away from here honestly it’s just not worth it< /text>

Well to start of was not very welcoming at all and was told that it would be a 30 minute wait which was not the case at all my wife and sat their for a good hour and that is being generous with the time and saw others come and go and apparently is more of a popularity contest rather than good business educate. On top of that the 5 women working their were very rude from the start and was not notified of if we were next and basically of a lot of patient customers existence and when I have been to other locations it has been a very nice experience but for some reason this location has a very bad problem with rude employees very bad business etiquette and no appreciation for its customers two very big thumbs down</text>

<review>I went in with long hair and came out with the most perfect pixie cut! I thought it would turn out horrible, but it turned out amazing! I look skinnier and I am so perky and happy! I highly suggest you get Torri for your haircut! She's brilliant! She has been at it for a long time, and she does a fast cut with AMAZING talent! She was so nice and helpful! I will be returning to her!<//review>< Pictures>

I went in today not knowing what to expect. I hadn't gotten a proffesional cut in a long time. As ive gotten older my sir has changed and ive had trouble trying to find out what to do with it. I had the pleasure of meeting shea today and she did the best job ive ever had on my hair. She was informative and understood my hair type I walked away with the biggest smile!! Thank you so much Shea!!!!< /Text>

The Bartlett Hotel and guesthouse is great inexpensive place well located as a launching point for visiting the city. My deluxe room with a private bathroom (Including a tub/shower) was clean, light and airy with large windows. The staff(Susan) was most welcoming and helpful throughout my 3 day stay. I would definitely stay here again. On the second floor is a full kitchen for cooking my own meals if I like. And coin operated washers and dryers. Filtered water dispenser.</Text>

This hotel is very basic overall. Design is not bad, the amenities do work just well enough and staff was not always friendly but helpful. Don't expect much, it will do the job:

The first room I got had only one window; and it faced a concrete wall. Staff was kind enough to find me another room for my remaining nights though.

My room was not serviced every day even though I asked for it at the check-in and put up a "make up my room" sign.

Shower was hard to figure out and more of a tepid drizzle.

No extras such as toothbrush or hairdryer.

In summation, I think it's fair to say that the hotel was ok but a bit on the expensive side for what it delivers.</text>

I see some reviews that felt the hotel was lackluster. It may be lacking in a few amenities that other larger hotels have. Was relocated from the sister property The Herbert, which I was initially upset about.  However, it is a very cute old narrow building in the heart of Union Square. Close to major bus routes, BART and attractions. Felt very safe here, given it is downtown and the Tenderloin is just a few blocks away. Double key-pad entry plus the need for a key to use the elevator. I felt safe here at night with my two children. They thought the rooms were cute and liked our view from the 6th floor. I believe there are 7 floors. I love the rooms and thought it had an old New York apartment feel to it. However, one elevator and it is small. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay here.<//text>

< review>
Underwhelmed.  To be fair, I booked for the Herbert (which I had stayed at before and enjoyed) and when I called two days before my trip to upgrade my reso I learned the Herbert wasn’t even open and we were being relocated to this sister property. Weird.  Why would this detail not be revealed during booking? In fact, the hotel only emailed about this change the day before our check in thus negating the minimum cancellation time frame.  I was hopeful but super disappointed.  The room quality (size, bed quality, etc) was much less than our previous stay at the Herbert Hotel.  It was so disappointing I checked out early and rebooked at another hotel in the area for a comparable cost and MUCH nicer room.</review>

Great value hotel in San Francisco. I stayed one night and was impressed by the price to quality experience. Room was clean and simple. Only reason I am giving 4 stars is that it is very loud from the street and the windows do not have the best noise cancellation. If you get a room next to the street expect to hear the hustle and bustle of the city until midnight which may not be the best for business travelers.<//Text>

Great location! Room was great! Service was difficult given COVID (no food service at the moment). But there is a Starbucks right across the street for breakfast! many outlets for charging and room had a huge window with a nice big fan. Bathroom was very clean and new. Bus was  walking distance!</review>

I stayed July 2019 in the private queen room and it was exactly like  the photos, cute, clean, comfy bed and a nice clean bathroom. We were looking for a budget friendly option and this was definitely a good hotel for the price. The only issue we had was the lift broke when we arrived (we had to take our bags up some steep/narrow stairs) but the staff made sure it got fixed the next day. There is a bistro/bar next door which was great for quick easy meals on some of the nights we were exhausted and just wanted to eat and crash (also good options for breakfast). The area itself is busy and very close to the Bart station however it can be a slightly shady area. Neither of us felt comfortable walking around at night (felt fine during the day) however that might also be us not being used to the overall atmosphere of the Tenderloin. Overall if budget is your main concern and you are looking for the best bang for your buck this is a simple, cute and cosy private hotel room perfect for a few days in SF.< /text>

<rate>None< /rate><text>Bartlett Hotel and Guesthouse is beautifully set up for someone who needs a couple of nights stay in SF with easy access to transit, shops, and the downtown area. The rooms are recently renovated, simple and clean, as are the bathrooms. Its furnishings are simple and spartan, the way I like it. If youre looking for a great deal of hotel amenties, its probably not the right choice, but for my preferences—a comfortable, clean place to sleep and relax while Im otherwise out and about—its just about perfect.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8085808f15d54abd:0xf312c0cb03577779< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Old school hotel. Somewhat clean but could be cleaner. TV's has about 6 working channels. local news only - no FOX or CNN. Attached brewery was a plus. Front desk service could have been better acting upon requests for simple things. (shower curtain, wash clothes, iron and ironing board). Over all not a bad stay but expected better.</Text>

<review>DON'T BOOK THIS HOTEL.

Only one star for the location.

- very old and dirty place. Shower was not working, no Bath stopper. Windows were not able to close ( very cold and a lot of noice) radiator was leaking.

Stayed here for one week. And changed room 3 Times. Staff of the front desk was lying consistent and the managers were almost impossible to speak with..<//review>< Pics>

<Text>The room was clean and looked recently refurbished...new floors, new bathroom and new paint. Simply but nicely furnished.As other reviewers said, wash cloths were not in the room but a quick call resolved that. Also there was no place to hang an hand towel in the bathroom. Seemed odd that these items were not there and ready for guests.My room did not have a mini fridge or microwave, another difference from the norm but not a deal breaker.The location is great, close to union square, several car rental places and a trolley line.I would definitely stay here again.<//Text>< Rating>

Property is very cute... quaint and simple, very minimalistic. Perfect location, only a 4 minute walk from the BART station and cable car pickup. There’s a great restaurant and bar downstairs that also gives discounts to hotel guests. Aside from all of these great things we probably got the worst sleep ever. Walls are extremely thin and we could clearly hear the phone conversation the person next door was having. That and the noise from the bar across the street we didn’t sleep until about 3 am and had to be up at 7 the following morning. If you’re looking for a good nights rest, don’t stay here... but if you’re going to be out on the town anyways and plan on sleeping late then this place is great, especially for the price.</Text>

<review>When we arrive around 6pm, whoever was in the front desk did not speak much English and told us that we cannot check-in. The front desk clerk is taking a break will come back after 8pm. so we asked to speak to someone else or manager who can actually help us. He would just say "no" refused to check us in and did not provide any contact. other person came in and said they cannot help us and told us to wait 2+hours or leave. we already booked and paid through online. we are requesting to speak to someone else and asked their names. one of them cursed at my partner while we are requesting help. This is not acceptable in any means. it was extremely humiliating, disturbing, and discriminating experience. we had no other choice other than waiting. our check-in time was at 3pm. this is NOT OKAY!!!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>No frills but cheap place to stay in San Francisco. Dont expect extras like hand towels , coffee. Also if you dont line lots of nose stay in the back of the hotel. We could not sleep the first- night because of the street noise. However we switched to a room in the back as long as its before 11 am. So just skip having to switch and get one away from the street and in the back of the hotel. Also you have to ask hair dryer, if you need one, so do that when you check in.< /Review>< resp>

<Review>Really loved this spot - clean, secure (front doors need access card after 7:30), rules about guest access were clear, etc. It was really cold in SF when I visited and the steam heat worked well, too. Only hotel in SF that comes close to the right price/value. I had a room with a private bathroom and will book the same when I visit again.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDxbmTqK6zdSC1pia6KANzyweBB0oCd2UfcMFi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Parking is expensive.  No Blow dryers in room.  Elevator old and slow.  Room is VERY plain.Good things are inexpensive, clean room, plenty of establishments close by.  Chipolte, Food stores, Irish pub across the street, hotel is connected to bar that does have Great breakfast and Great service</Text>

I’m always around SoMa for business and have tried many hotels. The cool thing about Bartlett is that the rooms have no carpet and the windows open widely. This is such a plus because I really don’t understand how locals can live with closed windows, carpet floors and no fresh air.< /Review>

The room was very basic, no fridge, no kettle, no coffee maker.  Nothing other than a bed and bathroom basically.  The hotel itself did not have a gym, pool, or any amenities.  The elevator was so slow that most of the time I would get tired of waiting after 5-10 minutes and just climb the stairs, 5 floors to my room.In spite of all of that, the room was $300/night !!! Unfortunately I had a conference in the Moscone and the Bartlett was the only close-by hotel that had availability for that week, which is why I took it.  Next time will definitely go to a different hotel.<//text>

The room was very clean.  It was spartan, yet spacious.  The location is great as is the price - given it’s location near Union Square & access to the Powell Street BART station.  It is a simplistic hotel - not a Hilton or a Hyatt.  Yet, given all factors, it’s great for those with a tight budget.</text>

Dirty Sheets! UUUURGH. I wanted to sleep in my street clothes. The place hasn;t been renovated in honestly 30 years. Snarky staff was a sign they know the place is a dump and they just dont care. The sole elevator is a screaching 1960s 4-person freight elevator, bathroom the amenities are the wall-mounted soap dispensers (no washcloth, go figure). SFOs bathrooms are much better than these hotel rooms.</Text>

<Name>Jaclynn Sensale<//Name><Review>Upon initial arrival the hotel room was much smaller than anticipated from pictures posted on hotels.com There were no drawers to place clothes in, the closet was large enough for only a few items, there was no alarm clock, hairdryer, phone, coffee maker, refrigerator, or microwave. The window faced the adjacent building with no natural light. No luggage service was provided (even with the elevator out of service) and if your room was not ready upon arrival you would be charged $2/hr for the front desk to hold your luggage. Bed comfort was less than optimal as was the temperature control of the room. Even after placing a please provide service tag on our room door our room was not cleaned for 3 days. The only day housekeeping cleaned was the first day and upon our return from a day in the city there were NO towels or wash rags in our room. When we requested clean towels from the front desk in person we were met with rudeness, eye rolling, and a response of "Do you need them now?" For the lack of service provided by this establishment the cost should have been less than half of what was charged and they should be advertised as a dormitory or hostel not a hotel. The only positive was the location, easy walk to everything, and the bar downstairs was pretty nice.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

Great hotel on a budget. Amazing location with Union Square right on the doorstep. Fairly small rooms including some dorm rooms with shared bathrooms. Individual rooms with ensuite are adequate size for the price. Shared laundry facilities. Clean and quiet. Great sports bar/restaurant next door with craft beer on tap - 10% discount for hotel guests.</text>

<review>I stayed here on a business trip and it was very comfortable, the room was clean and fresh, and it was centrally located. The only problem I had was that there wasn't air conditioning and the windows had no screens so bugs could (and did) come in. The guesthouse is close to lots of places to eat and there is a Walgreens just around the corner. Nice value for your money!<//review>< name>

<Text>Very convenient to Union Square, and rooms were sparse, but very comfortable (although temperature was not adjustable within the room, so it may not be for the super fickle).  Right next to convenient gastropub/microbrew for late night dining (kitchen open until 12:30 am on weekend)</Text>< pics>

<Review>I will admit that the place has some charm, but overall, it just gives off the vibe of an old school death trap. They took a really old hotel and made purely cosmetic upgrades. The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are tiny, there is NO A/C and steam heat which apparently stays on through May. There are no screens on windows, and the elevator is ancient. I really do not know how this hotel complies with modern life safety codes (one narrow internal egress stair and then just fire escapes for 40+ rooms, in an earthquake zone). It feels very unsafe in a modern world. To make matters worse, the service just isn’t good. I recommend that you take your money elsewhere.</Review>< Pics>

Fantastic spot for a short stay. Clean, quite and simple. No in-room phones or wash cloths; towels only. The restaurant is AMAZING. The elevator is old and at times unnerving. It is a great lil spot in Union Square!<//Review>

The elevator was unsafe, the hallways were very narrow, and the room itself was disgusting. It mimicked an overused dorm room with a queen bed. The plumbing in the bathroom smelled like sewage and the sheets had stains on them. The cherry on top was that there was no ac, and windows that open with no screens when you’re 5 stories high. We walked out within 10 minutes of checking in, received a full refund and got a 4 star hotel room down the street for the sama price. Highly recommend anywhere else.<//Text>< pics>

So the big pro for this place is the location. Definitely centrally located to many good spots.

Now that the good is out of the way let's dive in. The room was small but you know that going in. My BIG issue was the room service...there was none.

I was there for 5 days, first two days go by no one cleaned the room or left any towels despite me leaving the door card on for most of the day and me being out morning, afternoon and evening. At the end of the third day I call the front desk asking for room service and more towels. They tell me they wrote a note and I will get towels. Nothing... at the end of the fourth day I go to the front desk personally, they apologize, admit that the note was indeed made but was sorry no one came.

Morning of day 5 that I'm checking out, I am brought more towels........ I had to use the same three towels over and over again for 5 days. For the $200 a night that I paid, I expect at least clean towels. Very disappointing.

*Side note to keep in mind, no air conditioner or mini-fridge*</text>

Perfect room with minimal amenities that are usually not necessary anyway.  Beautiful new fixtures in the bathroom.  Very comfortable bed.  Pub with great beer and a 10% discount. Always busy on the weekend.  Coffee breakfast bar.  The only negative was that I had a hard time finding the door to the hotel.  Elevator worked well but I enjoyed taking the stairs to the 5th floor.  Great music in the stair wells.  Room TV was smaller but was in a great spot on the wall to watch from my bed.  I liked the fact that I had the option of not having housekeeping come.  Great location near Union square.  2 Starbucks in sight, across the street and on the corner down the street about 30 yards.  Will stay here again< /Text>

Very Nice hotel for a fair budget. Rooms are as described, large, comfy,and very clean, which is essential! Recently renovated by the looks. Had everything we asked for when needed (mjni fridge without extra charge, hair dryer as well). Hotel is calm but situated downtown so outside is loud but then again extremely well situated. Great hotel bar/restaurant too.<//Text>

We stayed here last week and were pleasantly surprised. It was close to Union Square and we had a room with a private bathroom. The room was very clean and comfortable. No frills but we hardly were there so didn't need any frills (hairdryer, hand towels, kleenex etc). To get into the hotel there were two doors that you needed to have a code card to get in so it felt very safe and quiet. There are homeless people roaming outside but we saw that almost everywhere, not just the area of the hotel. Nobody bothered us so it was fine.
The hotel has a restaurant/bar next door that had great food and a nice discount if you stay at the hotel. For the price and location we would certainly stay here again.<//review>

This is a great place to  stay for a reasonable price in the heart of San Francisco. I was staying here for a conference being held at the Moscone Center, and was within walking distance. The Bartlett made me feel safe because they lock the outside doors at 5:30pm and give you a key to get in the building after that. Bear in mind that this is a really no frills establishment, but it provides a nice clean room with a comfortable bed.
The place is a little loud, I could hear everything happening up and down the hallway, but for the most part the guests were courteous.< /Text>

Excellent location with clean, rustic-industrial finished rooms. Perfect if you are looking for a simple place to sleep as you explore the city. Front door locks and room locks also make you feel extra safe staying here. Pricing was perfect too.<//Text>

I'm really disappointed to say that this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, there were more things I disliked than liked. This place didn't offer basic amenities. Even a freaking motel 6 has more.
1. First of all, their ONLY elevator was broken when I got there, and still wasn't fixed by the time I checked out. I was staying on the 6th floor, so it was ridiculous to have to carry my luggage up and down those tiny stairs.
2. This place is LOUD. You can hear everything from the hallways, every time a door closed it woke me up throughout the night.
3. The room was big enough, but there wasn't any tissue, no phone, no mini fridge, no hair dryer. The closet and the table was the size of a mini fridge..
4. Apparently some rooms don't have their own bathrooms? Unfortunately I stayed in a room with no bathroom, so I had to use a separate key card to go use a shared bathroom that was just randomly outside in the hallway. And the shower was separate from the bathroom as well, had to use another key card for that. In total I was juggling like 5 different key cards for every room in that hotel.

Don't think I'll ever stay at the Bartlett again.<//text>

I was in town for a conference, found this hotel online and glad I made the right choice. Its about 5 minutes walk from the Bart station, and 10 minutes walk to my conference location. I had a queen bed room with bathroom on the 7th floor. The stair is really narrow so I had to rely on the elevator to get in and out of my room/hotel. The room was clean and cozy. However, its at a corner so only  has a small window, when I looked out the window, theres another hotel right across. The kitchen/common room on the second floor was nice, but I didnt use it. Good for people who want to save money and make their own meals. Staff was nice and helpful, but I only interact with them during check-in and check-out.< /Text>

<Text>Great place, our room was newly renovated and clean. Front desk staff was helpful,but didn't see anyone else including housekeeping. Our room was never tended too but we also didn't ask about housekeeping so maybe our fault.

Location is fantastic, right up the road from almost everything and transit. Would recommend to anyone.</Text><Time>1492294898072<//Time>< Response>

<Review>Excellent hostel with clean rooms and comfy beds. My partner and I stayed in one with a private bathroom, send it had everything we needed. Great location to use as a staging area for trips to the more touristy areas of the bay. I also really enjoyed having a gastropub right next to the hostel. Super convenient for a late night dinner or drink<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Worst hotel at honoring bookings. They couldn't "find" my reservation, along with the reservation of two other people in front of me. I had to find my own place to stay as the entire city was booked due to a conference.

Stay at some place larger that has better integration with hotel systems. If you really want to stay at this hotel, I would recommend pre-paying in full at the hotel.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Hotel room is good, but the bar/restaurant service is the worst. We sat for almost 10 min in a bar with barely anyone in it waiting to get served so had to go to the bar. Then the guy ignored me while he served others at the bar. I normally stay at the Nikko so lessoned learned. The hostess is the only reason I gave 2 stars.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8085808f15d54abd:0xf312c0cb03577779<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

A very practical place to stay. It's much cheaper to book through an app than by calling them directly, so search around. The room was very clean with windows facing the street. It was noisy at night during our weekend stay, but it felt atmospheric. The building has excellent security with helpful staff at the front desk 24/7. Our room had a queen size bed and a personal bath. The room was spacious enough but not really a place to hang out, mostly just served as our base camp. It's nearby plenty of places to eat with a lot of great options within a mile.<//Review>

<text>This is definitely a utilitarian, efficient hotel. We stayed in a queen room with a private bathroom, though some of the rooms have a shared bathroom. The place is SUPER clean, and since we were out and about pretty much the entire time we were in town, it served our purpose. There is no hair dryer in the room, so bring your own travel dryer, or ask for one downstairs. There is bulk shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the showers, but no hand towels or washcloths. TV has only a handful of channels. Starbucks is steps away, as is a Walgreen's and other fast food and convenience places. A good home base for our trip.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

This is a solid place to stay close to Union Square or Moscone Center. Reasonable prices and even a discounted breakfast from the Bartlell Hall next door. Right across the street from a dueling piano bar and Johnny Foley's!< /text>

Pros: We were happy with the room itself - nothing fancy, but since we were more interested in exploring the city, it was fine. It was also very quiet, since our windows faced a closed alley. The restaurant/bar downstairs has a good happy hour and the food was pretty good.

Cons: One of the windows didn't have a safety block to prevent it opening all the way; dangerous, given that we were on the 5th floor. The staircase was narrow and poorly-lit. The elevator was cramped, rickety, and didn't always feel like it stopped completely before the door opened. Generally, the building did not feel like it would meet fire codes and the shared spaces were more akin to what I've seen in poorly-maintained hostels.

Worst of all, on the first night, my partner starting feeling dizzy and nauseous after standing next to the open window. (We kept the windows open bc there is no AC.) Since he had been ill earlier in the week, we didn't think anything of it. However, on the third night, we both started having the same symptoms almost immediately after entering the room. We had been feeling fine all day and this was an abrupt change. After still no improvement from showering, we went back down to street level and reported this to the front desk, who didn't seem too concerned nor surprised. They said that although it wasn't frequent, this wasn't the first time this had been reported and asked if we smelled any "cleaning agents". We hadn't.

After spending a little time downstairs, the fresh air began to alleviate the issues but we weren't convinced we would be comfortable nor safe in our room. As a possible solution, the hotel staff offered to move us to a different room and gave us the key to check it out first. We went to the room (two floors up from our original room, facing the street instead of the alley), but we didn't feel better/started to feel the symptoms again. It was at this point that we decided we didn't feel safe, especially considering that our symptoms were among those listed for carbon monoxide poisoning and this wasn't the first time the hotel staff had heard this kind of issue from guests. We checked out and went to another hotel nearby.

Although we were refunded the nights remaining on our prepaid reservation, this whole experience was very disruptive to our trip and due to the last minute change, we ended up spending much more on lodging than expected.< /Text>

<review>Best hotel ever!

If you are lucky enough to afford this hotel you should totally book it. It's one of the best places I've ever stayed honestly.

Features I liked:
📍 Location: just a few squares from Moscone Center.
🚇 Public Transport: Buses, trams and subways to almost everywhere nearby the hotel! (Tip: buy a Clipper card).
🥞 Breakfast: it's not included but you can get 50% off on the restaurant that's named as the hotel.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>This place is located in Union square in San Fransisco, close to a lot of tourist activity. It was about 1/3 the cost of staying in a average hotel in San Fransisco. The room is modern, but bare bones and small(very European). The shower and bathroom are in rooms down the hall and available for everyone on that floor, but I didn't have an issue with availability and it was clean. If you're looking for a way to stay in San Fransisco on the cheap this is it.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Overbooked us. So we had to move and stay at Stratford. Then our room leaked water from the beginning onto our luggage. Now I'm waking up early to move our stuff to a different room. What a relaxing vacation...<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>None</Rating><text>This hotel is basically like a European hostel. We stayed in a room with a private bathroom and had no issues. Would stay here again if able to get the private bathroom. Close to all things downtown. Theyll hold your luggage for you after check out and arrange a shuttle to the airport for you. I asked if they could store luggage prior to check in and they originally said no but someone called back and said they would. Check in is at 3:00pm and they wouldnt do an early check in. Over all not a bad place to stay.</text>< pictures>

Overall a great hotel at a good price right in the heart of San Francisco.  The only problem was that on the 7th floor there next to no water pressure. You could shower but it wasn't easy. I don't know if lower floors are better.< /review>

Airbnb one of the rooms in this hotel. It stated check in was at 1pm, however it was at 3pm. Walked into our room, and it was still not cleaned and Nasty. Checked the bed sheets, it wasn't even changed. Nasty. But for a cheap accommodation, I can't really complain too much. Located in the middle of downtown. Great for anyone who just need a place to crash. The biggest problem for me was the smell. This hotel, smelled almost like poo. I did not like it at all.  Would not book this place again.</Review>

<review>It’s...fine. The rooms are...well it’s not a hotel. Don’t expect it to be. It’s a semi-converted dormitory. The rooms and very small, but that’s fine. Basic things like washcloths (!!!) and air conditioning are not included. The building is old and smells old. My sinuses were on fire every morning from the old building dust. It smells bad. The hallways are dirty. The room itself was clean though. The tv remote didn’t work. The elevator was broken and trudging up 7 flights to a hot and tiny room was not great.

In the end, if it’s your only option and you don’t mind anything above, go for it. Book through their website to get free (not great but fine) breakfasts from the attached restaurant (tip the wait staff!)<//review>< user>

<review>I've been staying here for more than 6 weeks with my 16 colleagues. I lost my 8 clothes and found them from the cleaning people and asked them why they took my belongings without permission and they responded, "Do you want us not to clean your room then?" I filed a complaint about this bad attitude of one of their employees but no one apologized. What's worse, 2 weeks after this happening, I lost my new shoes never worn when I was away for a few days for a business trip. It was my favorite. And during the same period, my roommate lost $1,100 that was in his pocket. I reported this to all the supervisors, all of whom passed the buck to the manager. So, I met the manager but she said she is not responsible for customer's lost items because of their policy. I asked her to show it and she refused. I have no option but going to the police. Oh one more thing. Internet access is so bad. Most of our members can't even work at this hotel.< /review>< pics>

It was clean quiet and in a good central (if overly touristy) location. My main issue with this hotel is that it isn't a hotel, it is a hostel that is charging hotel prices. Our room was 200/night and we didn't have a phone, blow dryer, or iron. View was of a brick wall. This room should have been half the price. The elevators and hall smell like mildew and the elevator is incredibly slow. An ok place to sleep if that's all you need but not for these prices.</review>

This is an excellent choice for the over priced hotel market of San Francisco. The location is perfect, 1 minute away from Union Square, 2 minutes away from Powell station and 5th av.
The en-suite room was clean with a good size bed and very quiet once you shut the windows. Fast wifi, clean toilet and bathroom and plenty of room fro luggage. The bar-restaurant is pretty cool and open till late. Plenty of choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner within walking distance. Overall very convenient and friendly. Would definitely choose again and recommend to anyone.<//Text>

I love the bunkhouse, great location, awesome employees, the rooms are very nice and always clean - It's been difficult to find openings there since they switched off AirBnB and did bookings directly on their site but I'd still recommend over any other hostel in SF<//Review>

I stayed here for one month in a double share room. Staff is kind and professional, common spaces are good like kitchen and the living room with Tv and Pc. Service Laundry available. The room are good for the price and the location (be careful it's next to tenderloin area). Price and quality are good for a short stay in sf. Strategic location for visiting the city a 100 mt to all the Bart and Muni stops.< /review>

It's pretty pricey for the quality of the room. The floor was dirty and there was not enough pressure on the hot shower. The window lock was broken so it wouldn't stay shut, meaning the room gets cold during the noise, not to mention the outside noise.< /review>

I was happy there as the price was right -- $20 a week as I recall and clean linen and towels every day plus it was furnished and included a refrigerator; I had to buy a hotplate to heat stuff.  The room didn't have a bathroom, but there was one down the hall that even included a shower.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Can I give it 0 stars? The hotel staff was unpleasant, there was a problem with bed bugs which they handled very poorly. They made my first international experience a complete nightmare by putting all my clothes on plastic bags WITHOUT telling me, entering my room with dogs when I was sleeping and so on. The internet connection was just absurd, very slow. The kitchen was always dirty and it didn’t smell good, being very expensive. I don’t ever wanna go back! This all happened between August and October, 2014.<//review>< Pictures>

Location is good, downtown and surrounded by everything you would need (Walgreens, Starbucks, Chipotle, Trader Joe's, etc. all within walking distance). Walking distance from public transit. Entrance was difficult to find, and the building itself is very rudimentary, with fairly thin walls and doors, along with a slow and very basic elevator. Room was perfectly adequate for me, everything was clean, and there was a single table attached to the wall that I could work on, although it was slightly loose and slanted. There was also a television that I didn't use. Bathroom was well stocked with shampoo, towels, etc. Nothing else to really talk about. Front desk was friendly and helpful, checked-in past midnight and had no issues with staff. Wi-Fi worked perfectly for my light internet use, but definitely not sufficient for anything more than that. Basic and adequate. However, walls and doors seem paper thin, could clearly hear noise from the hallway.<//Text>

I stayed there 2 weeks with Kaplan and the twinroom and bathroom was "okay", not the cleanest but average. The staff was friendly but I had to wait half an hour until I could check in. The Wi-Fi was slow sometimes and the TV didn't work.
If you dont expect high standards you won't get disappointed. And you won't be home that much anyway, when you always on sight seeing mode. And the hotel is in the best position possible. If you step outside you have everything you need like Chipotle, Starbucks and so on.. just a few steps away from ur hotel.</text>

Yep Chun is right these pics are fake. Place is basically a flophouse with long term low income tenants. It's sad this type of hotel is the only option for people down on there luck in a city that's so overpriced and overrated it should be illegal. And I used to live in SF so I know this for a fact being I did stay here for like one night of horror.<//text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Hotel in general
The Bartlett Guesthouse is next to the hall of the same name. This is a music club. It is an older building which you can tell. Almost 135 euros for a single room with simple standard is considered very expensive worldwide. For San Francisco it is still in the cheap range.

Location and surroundings
It couldn't be better. Union Square is around the corner. Very central.

service
Some of the staff took some getting used to. In particular, the somewhat older gentleman is on a fine line between absolute coolness and total apathy. You have to pay a small fee for luggage storage.

.
Sports, pool & entertainment
The music club is right next door. There is also some entertainment in the area.

room
Small rooms, bathroom has recently been noticeably renovated. The whole thing also applies to the floor where my room was. Extremely fast and good internet. You can tell that Silicon Valley is around the corner.

Hotel allgemein
Das Bartlett Guesthouse liegt neben neben der gleichnamigen Hall. Das ist ein Musikclub. Es ist ein älteres Gebäude was man auch merkt. Fast 135 Euro für ein Einzelzimmer mit einfachen Standard ist sehr teuer weltweit betrachtet. Für San Francisco gehört es noch zum günstigen Bereich.

Lage & Umgebung
Besser geht es fast nicht. Der Union Square ist um die Ecke. Sehr zentral.

Service
Personal ist zum Teil etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig. Insbesondere der etwas älterer Herr ist auf einen schmalen Grad zwischen absoluter Coolness und totaler Apathie. Für die Gepäckaufbewahrung muss man eine kleine Gebühr zahlen.

.
Sport, Pool & Unterhaltung
Der Musikclub ist gleich nebenan. Auch in der Umgebung gibt es einiges an Unterhaltung.

Zimmer
Kleine Zimmer, Bad wurde vor kurzem erkennbar renoviert. Das Ganze gilt auch für die Etage wo sich mein Zimmer befand. Extrem schnelles und gutes Internet. Da merkt man das der Silicon Valley um die Ecke ist.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvg3yjPzU5MXaaIbzGONeWz5kzYu8wr7_zgK8E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0VXm5V5T7IEeIdlbOkg7jdcVd-pyGf2QrZsWE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnsuJ23BuoD1Mt0En2MJIgZMEdbKy0ra8_4L9L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2gkaErdEcEIr1OEAlK2NYblw5BBlQSKH1LLwk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWDmOGSQ1Qzw3Ihd2O241YX364oLpf3lD9uOGw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqKtTYndDkzKK0JMJDKs3TIbReQNwZ8PpE_ZGH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Very good location to get around the city. In the center and very close there is a 24h supermarket with great prices for San Francisco where a bar breakfast costs $ 15. Friendly staff. Discrete rooms. With windows without light overlooking a wall most and cannot be opened .... fairly good cleaning. Various hair for the room. Very comfortable very good bed. Rooms often noisy mine looked out on an internal tunnel where under a fireplace the kitchens, one day there was a great stench.

(Original)
Posizione molto buona per girare la città.  In pieno centro e vicinissimo ce un supermercato aperto 24h con prezzi ottimi per San Francisco dove una colazione al bar costa 15 dollari.  Personale gentile. Camere discrete. Con finestre senza luce con vista su un muro la maggior parte e non si possono aprire.... pulizia discretamente buona . Vari capelli per la stanza. Letto ottimo molto comodo. Camere spesso rumorose la mia dava su un tunnel interno dove sotto cera un camino delle cucine, un giorno cera un gran puzzo.</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Good location. 30 minutes from San Francisco International Airport, 5 minutes from Powell St. Station.
There was a mistake and the room was changed at check-in. (This hotel is bad or Expedia is bad ...) We have a bunk bed in 2 rooms. There is no change in whether sheets or towels have a fixed date. No dryer, no hangers.
However, it was clean because I only slept, and it was reasonable.

(Original)
立地がいい。サンフランシスコ国際空港から30分、Powell St. Stationから5分ほど。
手違いがあり、部屋がチェックイン時に変更。(このホテルが悪いのかエクスペディアが悪いのか・・・) 2段ベッドが2台の部屋に宿泊。シーツやタオルは日が決まっているのか交換なし。ドライヤー、ハンガーなし。
とは言え眠るだけだったので清潔だし、まずまず。</Review>

<user_name>葉子亘</user_name><review>(Translated by Google) The decor is retro and tasteful, and the location is in the city center. This is the only thing to praise, but there are too many accommodations in the city center. If you knew it early, you would not want to live here. The pressure is very small, and I ca n’t take a good bath. The winter is cold. The room is not heated at night. The bath towels are dirty. The shower head and bedside light switch are not available. There is no hair dryer. I don't know, it costs 2 dollars to deposit luggage only in cash. It is not recommended for people who are afraid of cold or who need to stay for many days.

裝潢復古有味道，位置在市中心，這是唯一值得誇讚之處，但有太多市中心的住宿，若早知道就不會想住這家，設備簡陋外，自來水有一股怪味，蓮蓬頭水壓超小，完全無法好好洗澡，冬天洗會冷，房間晚上也沒有開暖氣，浴巾很髒，沐浴乳壓頭、床頭燈開關都無法使用，沒有吹風機，櫃檯人員相當冷漠，問什麼都說不知道，寄放行李一個就要2美元只收現金，不建議怕冷的人或需要住很多天的人入住。<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< date>

(Translated by Google) Central hotel and close to everything. The staff are helpful and available. The lunches are very good and included at the hotel restaurant when you book on their website. The rooms are simple and clean.
The reason why I put the hotel 4 stars is for certain details such as the fact that there was no glass available in the room, that the windows are a bit old and difficult, etc.
Value for money it's really worth it.

(Original)
Hôtel centrale et proche de tout. Le personnel est serviable et disponible. Les déjeuners sont très bon et inclus au restaurant de l'hôtel lorsque l'on réserve sur leur site internet. Les chambres sont simple et propre.
La raison pour laquelle je met 4 étoiles l'hôtel c'est pour certains détails comme le fait qu'il n'y avait pas de verre disponible dans la chambre, que les fenêtre sont un peu vieille et difficile, etc.
Rapport qualité prix ça vaut vraiment la peine.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent quality price in the Union Square from where you can move on public transport to any point of the city in about 15-20 minutes. 5 minutes from the BART and Metro stop that connects the two airports with direct line. We had a room with its own bathroom which made the stay even more comfortable. It is a historic building that has been tastefully renovated, conserving elements of the building such as wrought iron radiators and windows. I would definitely repeat it.

(Original)
Excelente calidad precio en pleno Unión Square desde donde podrás moverte en transporte público a cualquier punto de la ciudad en unos 15-20 minutos. A 5 minutos de la parada de BART y Metro que comunica los dos aeropuertos con línea directa. Tuvimos una habitación con baño propio lo que hizo todavía más cómoda la estancia. Es un edificio histórico reformado con mucho gusto conservando elementos del edificio como los radiadores de hierro forjado y las ventanas. Sin duda repetiría.< /Text><resp>None</resp>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) In the city center, it is convenient to go anywhere.
Room equipment is ok, but the bathroom has less water pressure.
The elevator is relatively old and has to wait for a long time.
Not bad for short stays

(Translated by Google) I did not think at that time because I was able to reserve in kanji, but I was reserved in English for Chinese reading, and I could not make a reservation even if I gave my name as it is ... I became cold and sweated . It is recommended to make reservations in the alphabet.
Location is the best near BART station. The room is decent, or rather narrow for the price.
Near the entrance and the restaurant are fashionable.

(Original)
漢字で予約できたのでその時はなにも思わなかったけど、中国語読みの英語で予約されていて、自分の名前をそのまま伝えても、予約がありませんねえ…となってしまって冷や汗かきました。予約はアルファベットでするのがおすすめです。
ロケーションはBARTの駅近で最高。部屋はそれなり、というか値段の割には狭い。
入り口付近とレストランはオシャレでいいかんじです。</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a good option in San Francisco, its price is good considering that it is very close to several tourist spots and two blocks from the metro. It is a hostel with the option to book a room with a private bathroom (it has a tub). Nice, clean. If I would return. The only thing that I would put to my experience is that the elevator did not work during my stay and I had to climb the stairs to my room, tired if you have no condition. If you arrive before check-in time, it is likely that the room is not ready yet, but you will be able to store your suitcase.

(Original)
Es una buena opción en San Francisco, su precio es bueno considerando que esta muy cerca de varios puntos turísticos y a dos cuadras del metro. Es un hostal con opción a reservar cuarto con baño privado(tiene tina). Agradable, limpio. Si regresaría. El único pero que le pondría a mi experiencia es que el elevador no funciono durante mi estancia y me tocaba subir por las escaleras a mi cuarto, cansado si no tienes condición. Si llegas antes de la hora del check in , es probable que aun no este listo el cuarto pero te dan facilidad de guardar tu maleta.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW33PNtKfNkD8XnW8on6ksNdmkxa0wX3djSpYp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPewrTgFXnmMtT5k9uvHG-W2EUz79nrCOt9kwSn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW5ZsJAhOGHUwsiXy13iUh2flJXo7URnljb1c6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Das Hotel ist sehr sauber, die Zimmer sehr geschmackvoll und groß dieht neu renoviert aus. sieht auch von aussen wie diese aus alten Filmen aus. Lage ist fantastisch. Jetzt die minus punkte: für Ablage wenig Platz und nach vorn raus ist wohl starker Strassenlärm, was ich aber nirmal finde für Lage Innenstadt, aber eir hatten nach hinten ider seitlich vom Nachbarhotel 24 Stunden Klimaanlagenbeschallung das ist mangelhaft. Der Pub neben an als Tip top Frühstück und auch essen super< /Review>

Tolles Stadthotel im Hipster-Look; frühzeitiges Buchen hilft bei der Erzielung von guten Zimmerpreisen. Komfortables Hotel auf 3-Sterne Niveau. Top Innenstadt-Lage. Frühstück im benachbarten Bartlett Hall Restaurant ebenfalls gut; Allerdings Nachts aufgrund der Lage recht laut. Uns hat es nichts ausgemacht.<//review>

Tout aurait été parfait si ça n’avait pas été des portes qui mènent aux chambres ( portes entre deux couloirs de chaque étage) qui font un vacarme de fou lorsqu’elles sont utilisées (souvent et toute la nuit).  Pour ceux qui ont un sommeil léger.....je ne recommande pas.  Sinon tout était parfait.<//Review>

Wir waren für drei Tage in San Francisco und sehr zentral in der Nähe des Union Square untergebracht. Die Zimmer sind relativ großzügig, Bäder neu renoviert und sehr sauber. Zum Frühstück gibt es viele Möglichkeiten in der Umgebung. Ein Teil der Zimmer geht seitlich zu einem schmalen Innenhof, in dem verschiedene Wärmetauscher und Abzüge brummen. Am besten ein Zimmer mit erneuerten zwei-Scheiben Glas nehmen, das schließt einiger Maßen. Je nach Schicht ist das Personal von ahnungslos bis sehr kompetent und hilfreich.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I understand that it is a low cost accommodation, however, this does not mean that they will knock on the door of your room at 1 am to let you know that you have an order from you at the reception.
The guy who was at the reception woke us up and was extremely stupid, I had to go down at dawn to get a little package of mine that had arrived and they had already informed me that they could receive and store without problems.
I stayed 5 nights and did not clean any room in the day.
So I do not recommend it because they are not professionals in what they do. They do not treat their guests well.

(Original)
Entendo que é uma acomodação de baixo custo, porém, isso não quer dizer que vão bater na porta do seu quarto 1 hora da manhã para avisar que tem uma encomenda sua na recepção.
O cara que estava na recepção nos acordou e foi extremamente estúpido, tive que descer de madrugada para pegar um pacotinho meu que havia chego sendo que eles já haviam me informado que poderiam receber e armazenar sem problemas.
Fiquei 5 noites e não fizeram limpeza nenhum dia no quarto.
Portanto não recomendo porque não são profissionais no que fazem. Não tratam bem seus hóspedes.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The hotel itself is very good, spacious and bright room (no coffee, no fridge), correct sink (no dryer and only one towel per person), all clean, and very central location. However, the nights were EXTREMELY LOUD. We were on the last and seventh floor and EVERY night there was some hellish and very long noise in the street: trucks and even works on the public road late at night. I do not even want to imagine how it was heard from the lower floors, of course it left us almost whole nights awake.

(Original)
El hotel en si esta muy bien, habitación espaciosa y luminosa (sin cafe, ni nevera), lavabo correcto (sin secador y una sola toalla por persona), todo limpio, y ubicación muy céntrica. No obstante, las noches fueron EXTREMADAMENTE RUIDOSAS. Nosotros estábamos en el último y séptimo piso y CADA noche había algun ruido infernal y muy prolongado en la calle: camiones e incluso obras en la via pública a altas horas de la madrugada. No quiero ni imaginarme como se oía desde los pisos inferiores, desde luego a nosotros nos dejo noches casi enteras en vela.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Simple but comfortable room. Cleaning well.
The situation is fine, very central, but it is extremely noisy. The first night, a truck with an electric generator stopped in front of the window at 2am, it was like sleeping inside a mixer. The hotel staff, inexperienced and unresponsive, did not offer us any solutions. The third night the same thing was repeated at 3am they began to do works in front of the window.

(Original)
Habitacion sencilla pero cómoda. Limpieza bien.
La situación esta bien, muy centrico, pero es extremadamente ruidosa. La primera noche, se nos paró un camión con un generador eléctrico delante de la ventana a las 2am, era como estar durmiendo dentro de una batidora. El personal del hotel, inexperto y poco resolutivo, no nos ofrecio ninguna solución. La tercera noche se repitió lo mismo  a las 3am se pusieron a hacer obras delante de la ventana.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Cleanliness of the room very good and location great.

It has no parking or agreement with any nearby parking for special price. The cheapest one we found was at $ 35 a day.

The room we were given was next to the elevator and bathroom door (shared) and there was a lot of noise.

(Translated by Google) The air conditioning outside rushes day and night. You can hear it in a closed window and also at the pool you have to talk aloud to understand each other. The price of the car (parking) for three days just under $ 200 I was appalled that this hotel has 4 stars.

(Original)
Die Klimaanlage draußen rauscht Tag und Nacht. Sie hört man bei gesschlossenem Fenster und auch am Pool muss man sich laut unterhalten um sich zu verstehen. Der Preis für das Auto (Parken) für drei Tage knapp 200 $ ich war entsetzt, das dieses Hotel 4 Sterne hat.</Review>

The air is generally very bad in the building. Our room was facing a small yard, in which many noisy a/c machines of the neighboring building were operating. So we could not open the window during the night and it became very hot in the room.All the doors are pretty sticky. The hotel is not worth the money. Breakfast is not included, location ist excellent.</review>

(Translated by Google) Retro style hotel. Renovated rooms but retaining their "touch" old. Very good location with cable car and BART terminal less than 10 minutes.

(Translated by Google) Absolutely to avoid and especially NOT to book this hotel via Airbnb: they never have anyone at the reception, do not warn you that Airbnb users do not have access to housekeeping services, unlike others (I had to negotiate hours one evening to finally get fresh linens) the room was ridiculously small and overall this terrible experience was well overpaid for what it is. Didn't want to believe the unanimously negative reviews online, I should have

À éviter absolument et ne surtout PAS réserver cet hotel via Airbnb : ils n'ont jamais personne à la réception, ne vous préviennent pas que les usagers Airbnb n'ont pas accès aux services de housekeeping, contrairement aux autres (j'ai dû parlementer des heures un soir pour finalement obtenir des draps frais), la chambre était ridiculement petite et globalement cette très mauvaise experience était bien trop chèrement payée pour ce que c'est.

< Review>
David and Brooke were extremely kind and helpful. I initially picked the wrong sized unit and they were so accommodating when the changes had to be made. They are hardworking and efficient. Highly recommend this facility for storage needs.<//Review>

I worked with David at Storage West Oceanside to set up a large storage unit for when my husband deployed. He was so great to work with, made everything super easy, especially since we did everything over the phone due to COVID-19.

We had a last minute change in plans and didn’t end up using the storage unit at all, and they gave us a full refund. I will definitely go to them if we ever need storage in Oceanside again and would recommend them to anyone in the area!< /text>

<text>David the full time manager at the above address is a   10 star employee....I have had two lockers with Storage West. David helped & supported me on at least 3 occasions when abnormal occurrences  occured. He helped me immediately in each case, was kind, efficient & professional. All help has been good at this site while I had property here. If I ever need storage again I will not hesitate to use Storage West.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1505488315131, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the review Gloria.

<review>The on-site managers Jake and Jennifer provided nothing but exceptional customer service. Communication was always quick via email, and if they were away from the office I always got a call back promptly. For the same price of some smaller units at other locations, Storage West offered bigger storage options. I have nothing but good things to say about our experience with them and if i needed more storage in the future I would definitely go through them again. Thank you!<//review>< resp>

<Text>My husband went on a Monday @ 8:15pm and the girl working just put a paper on the dirty metal counter right over the trash hole. When she started preparing the sandwich my husband asked where the cutting boards were, she replied with we washed them already but they are opened til 10pm. The meat from his sandwich touched the dirty metal counter the girl just shoved it back in the sandwich. When he told her she just rolled her eyes. We always go to subway in Arroyo Grande, but we just moved to Nipomo, but I rather drive to Arroyo Grande and know I'm eating clean food.< /Text>< Pics>

Too busy gossiping about another customer rather then helping customers get what they need! Inappropriate language very disappointing. Champ needs to do better hiring for sure. I was hoping to walk out with the vapormaxs they had on sale but couldn’t get the help I need.  Good stock selection bad customer service.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I received an email that my order was ready to pickup. When I entered the mall, the store was CLOSED, even thought I was there before the store closure. The doors were locked, nobody was inside, and the lights were off. I called the store number about 5 times and nobody answered. I’m very disappointed with the store for unexpected closure.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Hello I live in the bay area and have been doing your raffles for a while now never won but always entered to win. As you should know your releases do not come to every store but as a VIP member we are still given option to choose store which u want to participate in drawing and if u want a headstart you are able to enter any Champs for headstart code. Well today at 235pm on November 7 I entered store #15055 district mallb Westfield valley Fair Danny refused to give me the code for the blue the great fearless Jordan 1 mids because he says his store wasn't getting them. As a customer and VIP member I think this is not right I already had to drive 7 hrs to LA in case I won and to not even be given a chance at ahead start. As a manager you should want to drive sales not only for your store but your company as well. I expect some type of compensation wether it be my headstart or something else in the future.</Review>

< Review>
I visited this store today. While I was looking through the tea shirts, an employee named Owan started fixing the shelf. I told him, "Let me finish looking through then you can fix it." He showed an attitude, walked away rudely by murmuring something, and didn't know at all how to treat the customers. I talked to the manager, I hope he talks to him.<//Review>

<Text>Simply amazing.  They honored their phone quote even though the job ended up taking much longer then they planned due to problems with my ignition key cylinder which was not part of the quote.  They disassembled the ignition key cylinder, repaired it, made me two new keys and programmed to key fobs all for the original quote.  I would recommend this locksmith company without any hesitation whatsoever.</Text>< Response>

I was very satisfied with the service. I had a spare key made for my truck with the fob included. We had a minor hurdle but he was professional patient and included a bonus key just for the wait. As a fellow small business owner I was very impressed in every way. Strongly recommend for any kind of key services for your vehicle.< /Text>

Steve was excellent. He came out at 7 am and only took 20 minutes to get to my location. I will use him again in the future. He made me an extra key for my ignition free of charge. Honestly best experience I’ve ever had with a locksmith.</text>

<Text>I bought a blank key for my 2014 Mustang on Amazon and took it to EZ Car Keyz to get it cut and programmed. The guy that helped me was fast and I was out of there within 5 minutes. Dealership wanted me to set an appointment and charge me nearly triple the price! Sorry I didn’t get the guys name but overall great service, competitive pricing, and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend him.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Locked my keys in my car at the Oxnard shores on harbor Oxnard Ca,
Searched for a mobile locksmith and found Steve with EZ car keys.
He was the best result for a car locksmith.
He arrived quickly and dealt with my car lock out situation and made me a car key replacement.
Very grateful for the quick and affordable service and will definitely call again in the future.< /Text>

<review>I highly recommend this service.
1. Order replacement FOB from Amazon.
2. Request Key Code from Dealer (have on hand for emergency)
3. Provide Key code from Dealer to EZ Car Keys of Oxnard.
$40 for the Key, $40 for the code, save $ for cuts from
EZ Car Keyz.
My cut was $60 for two keys.
He also showed the steps to reprogramming my FOB.
This service is a no brainer.</review><userid>110706005844458527917<//userid><Rate>5<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

I was able to find EZ Keyz on Google very quickly. I sent a message for a quote and Niv responded within minutes. He came in less than 20minutes after we finalized the details. It's been a very rough weekend after having my purse stolen, and Niv was so fast, exceptionally reasonable pricing, that it made the situation much brighter. Thank you!</Review>

This guy was the hands down absolutely coolest locksmith I’ve ever met. He took 25 minutes from start to finish and was very friendly. He was also very well educated in his trade (keys). I definitely will keep him in my contacts. Go to this guy bro. BMW BOYS.<//review>

Awesome service, had a problem getting in to my car with the key fob. Niv was supper helpful and fast. Contacted them on 11/27/2019 while I was at work, he gave he me a quote. The price was resealable, we set up the appointment for the next day at 10:00am and he was finished around 10:30am great job. thanks Niv<//text>

I had two factory replacement keys made and programmed for my 07 Toyota Tacoma. The young guy did it from the vehicle code inside the door lock. He was knowledgeable, quick and did an awesome job. His name escapes me, but great service! Highly recommend Niv the Locksmith! And great pricing as well. Two thumbs up!<//Review>

Niv is the man! Can't believe how knowledgeable he is and same day service was amazing. He programmed two new keys for my Saab which I thought was impossible unless you were a Saab specialist. Nope the guy is a wizard! 100% would recommend and use again.</Review>

Super professional and honest about the pricing.

Niv is fast, reliable, and a good business man.  Gave me a good deal and got me on the road.  That’s all anyone needs.

*update 6/9* promised a receipt later that day but is still waiting for one.  Lost one star bud, got to stand by your word.  Will continue to update post base on actions.< /Review>

I'd give more stars to Niv if I could.

I called Niv on a Saturday to program two new remote transponder keys for my 2009 Honda Fit after losing my original key.  I had a back-up cut key without the electronics, so just wanted the programming, not cutting. He was able to help me right away.   One of my blank transponder keys wouldn't work, so he gave me one - at no additional charge! And his price to cut  new keys was so good, I had him do the programming and cutting on the two new ones. Everything was fantastic.  I'll never go to anyone else, and neither should you.<//Text>

Niv went above and beyond helping me out of a serious issue! He was prompt and fair! I had an issue with changing out an ignition cylinder with a part purchased from the dealer, that was wrong! He got my vehicle back on the road, my kids to school and helped me go after the dealer for costs incurred!  Two thumbs way up and I have found my locksmithing needs handled for life! Would recommend to anyone!<//Review>

<Text>I was working in Ventura cleaning up the homes damaged by last years fire and somehow i managed to snap the key of my semi truck inside the ignition. I was beginning to stress since I am not from around the area and had no clue how to fix this problem. Thankfully i was able to come across NIv on google and he had me back on the road working well within an hour. Awesome rates and outstanding service. I recommend anyone to contact Niv with all your locksmith needs. Thanks bro< /Text>< Rate>

Don’t take your car to a dealer and get ripped off by their overpriced rates.  Call Niv if you want honesty, integrity, quick service and someone that will come to your location. VERY DEPENDABLE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE.

<review>Highly recommended. Called up, spoke live with the Locksmith, price was quoted, arrived in 10-15 minutes, had door opened within about 3-5 minutes, price charged as quoted. Courteous and professional service, reasonable price. Now my go-to locksmith.</review>< Rating>

Incredibly fast, professional, and talented. I called Niv for a Ford Explorer key replacement, he arrived within 20 minutes he was friendly and very easy to work with.
Hopefully I'll never need to use a locksmith again, but he would be my call if I had to.<//review>

<Review>Niv saved me in my time of need! Not only did he charge WAY less than any other local locksmith, but he was able to meet me within 15 minutes of me calling. Within an hour of reaching out, he had cut, programmed and tested a brand new transponder key for my Honda. Niv was really kind and pleasant to talk with. He'll be my recommendation for anyone looking for locksmith services in Ventura county! Thank you!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Niv quoted me a flat price over the phone and kept his promise. He was much better than the dealer and he was able to come to me and cut the key in my driveway. Overall great service communication and price.<//text>< Pictures>

Niv came to make a key for my friend while I was there so i decided to ask him a quick question about my own key problem and he did not hesistate to help. After a few minor test he fixed it and my key started working again. He also gave me great tips on what to do if the probleme reoccurs. great guy he helped a brother out.< /text>

Tim came out and diagnosed why the front door of our townhouse would not unlock. He was super professional and replaced the lock, rekeying so that it was the same as the other doors in the home. The price was reasonable, but the service was top notch 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I highly recommend this company</Review>

So he showed up on time, and got the key made pretty fast.
It looks like he knew exactly what he was doing.

<Text>Lost the keys for my 07 Mercedes e350, called around and nobody was able to do it besides Niv,
He came out the same day and make me two keys.
Which was cheaper than the dealer.

Affordable, professional and quick we contacted niv for a ford truck remote key and he quoted us a fair price over the phone.
He came out within 25 minutes and got the job done. He was friendly too.< /review>

Niv was able to rekey my motorcycle. I went to many hardware stores that could not help me. He also got a key for my friends lomousine and programed a key fob. He came to our house and made duplicate keys for us. I will always keep coming back to Niv for any lock that needs a key. He is very professional and gave us a great deal. Thanks for everything<//review>

<Review>Contacted this locksmith for a blank motorcycle key to be cut to the ignition on my Yamaha. I purchased the blank from cal coast prior to inquiring this service. This locksmith was an hour and a half late on the first day. I had to go to work and the key was never made.

I scheduled the appointment with the locksmith again. On the second scheduled date he never showed up. I have a good feeling he is not able to do motorcycle keys. Good luck with this locksmith if you own a motorcycle. He seems like a very petty individual as well.
I will recommend Tricounty Locksmiths for motorcycles in the Ventura County.  Tri County will charge more, however they will show up on time and finished the job in 15 minutes. Jeff at Tricounty is also very professional. He is a sincere business man. unlike Niv the Locksmith.

This locksmith failed to show up twice, then told me he was booked for two weeks. NIV doesn’t want your business.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>
{'time': 1537066355434, 'text': "i love how you left a 2-star review then contacted me right after to get the key cut again because you can't fine anyone that can cut it, lol.\nunlike all the other locksmiths i was willing to help you.\ni did show up an hour late yes, but i texted you before i left\nand got a response that your mom will be there.\ni got there and nobody was there.\n\ni understand that you're a little upset about the situation,\nand i did apologize before on the phone.\n\nso you want to be a bully leave a negative review and give me the choice either cut it or take the 2star, then no thank you,\nand i don't want to be your locksmith.\ngood luck with finding one."}< /resp>

<text>Today my son locked his only set of keys in his car while running .  It was Niv the LockSmith to the rescue just like superhero’s.  My son did not have money and was expecting me to pay which I normally would have but my check didn’t go into The bank until 7 PM as I am on disability right now, I explained this to Niv who would not leave the car running in the street. He asked how much I had on me but unfortunately I only had $20, and did not think that would be enough but he graciously excepted it there’s not many people I know that would have done that.   I will highly recommend Niv for all locksmith needs. Niv and his associate were kind, professional and efficient.   If you are in need of a locksmith give Niv Thw LockSmith a try you won’t be sorry.</text><response>None<//response>< pictures>

Did a great job !! . explained everything he did
Helped me with my 2015 Jeep Wrangler.
My keys was stolen at the gym and niv was able to come out and rekey the door and the ignition.
He charged me half of what the dealer was asking and he provided me an extra key with the remote for a decent price.
Highly recommended to anyone that needs a car rekey. Thank you niv.<//Review>

Niv quoted me a flat price over the phone.
He showed up shortly and made me a spare.

He was the cheapest by far, he arrived within a very short notice on the weekend and and rekeyed all the locks that needed to be changed pretty quickly and efficiently. The gentleman was friendly and nice. He gave us free 4 copys with no charge.
