<review>I was disappointed with the lack of flavor in the breakfast sandwiches. We got the Sriracha Honey Sunrise and the Skinny Bacon Avocado & Tomato Egg White, and the hash brown cup. They look delicious, freshly made, and made quickly, but they lacked any of the strong flavors that I was expecting, particularly for the Sriracha Honey sandwich - it wasn’t spicy at all and the sweet undertones were so subtle that they were missed.

The Skinny sandwich was better, and I’d recommend that over the honey sriracha, but only because the tomato spread gives the sandwich some flavor complexity, adding a sweet smokiness to it. For the hash brown, I could take it or leave it. I was excited for the flavors included (chives, cream cheese, cheddar, etc.), but it left me unimpressed.

For the price of the sandwiches (~$7 each) and the underwhelming flavors all around, I wouldn’t recommend it.< /review><GmapID>0x80dcdef70d89379d:0x38b67d6a60bde03c< /GmapID>< Pics>

Another bagel’s place that we visited for the first time. They have varians bagels and I constantly like chocolate chips bagel. And my husband try new taste for onion bagel with cream cheese salmon flavored. The taste so far so good and acceptable for our tounge. And the service pretty quick and good as well.</Text>

<Review>The food was good, not great but good, and the bagels were not as flavorful as some other brands. The service was friendly, however it was so hard to hear that we had to continually say the same thing multiple times, making for an odd transaction. While from from order to checkout was timely, it was a little disorganized in the service end of things. I will say this, I am sure under more normal circumstances (non-covid) the process might be a little more efficient.< /Review>< time>

You could smell the old fish before even opening the wrapping of the sandwich. My friend took a bite of it to see if I was overreacting and immediately threw it up. When we contacted the store they said it was fresh and they would not be throwing it out. Will not be going back and neither should you unless you want food poisoning. Disgusting!!<//Text>< Pics>

Very close to several hotels like Homewood and Renaissance, the shop serves fresh bagels and a variety of cream cheese, breakfast sandwiches etc, and decent coffee. We were sick of the hotel's buffet breakfast and enjoyed this place for a change. I highly recommended this place.< /Review>

Surprisingly got the wrong cream cheese, bad chai no frothing and bad attitude from the girl with very low energy and super slow to take care of customers. I always go when there are different people and they are great, and best place for chai tea latte,.When I drove back hoping she would fix the problem and frustrating because I was going to be late to work. She instead asked if I wanted my money back. Great! All the waiting and two trips for nothing because she didn’t even offer to repair her mistake.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The skinny bagel is where they slice most of the middle of the bagel out. Just means less bread. They use a sun dried tomato spread which makes the sandwich. This particular restaurant is pretty big and not very crowded. The parking sucks but I usually find a spot with a short wait. They have free wifi. I always appreciate the iced lemon water.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I come here a lot and order bagel which are really good but they aren't that friendly to me and i hate to play the race cared but i feel that's what it is since i really don't say anything. A couple times they weren't as far as to skip over me. They rush my order even though I'm being polite. Done might said why come back well it's because their bagels are really good and I'm not going to stop going to a place because it makes the employees UNCOMFORTABLE.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Very bad customer service. They donot care for customers. We were 08 people and they asked us to come back after twenty minutes at around 1pm which is peak hours and they were not entertaining any customers. They let all customers who were entering the restauraunt go back.
Looks like the owner was away and the counter staff wanted some free time.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Great food , fast service and our take out was ready right away!! The only thing with this location is the parking lot  , it's really small and it makes it difficult at Prime hours to try and get your food when you have nowhere to park. The thing of it is is if there's nothing in the parking lot there's nowhere else to park on the street near by</Review></record></dataset><record>

Whoever Monica is that deals with the catering to companies and the customer service at this company is not pleasant and unprofessional. We had a once a month, never changed the date, to have breakfast and one month they were late and today the did not show. Now they are hanging up or saying they did not receive an email about adding additional food. The email was to add food, it did not say anything about not wanting them to come. She assumed and did not confirm anything and "never got an email" it may not be this location exactly but the company is hard to deal with. Einstein bagels have better presentation FYI.< /Text>

<Text>This was a place I visited often. Not any more after today. The girl who was making my turkey sandwich wasn't paying attention and dropped the deli turkey into their disposal tray by accident and pulled it OUT and placed it on my sandwich. As if there wasn't anything wrong with her action. WHAT!? When I told her she couldn't do that and to make a new sandwich. She got upset looked at her coworker. They looked at me like whats the problem?! REALLY?! So she removed the bad turkey and put new turkey on the same dirty sandwich. There wasn't s manager around to advise. If you want clean food don't go there.< /Text><rate>1</rate>< gmap_id>

<rating>2</rating><Review>This location is extremely understaffed. I don’t blame the workers, but the management for not spending a couple extra bucks on hiring enough staff to adequately serve the crowd they pull in. My food was made wrong, and they were too busy to fix it. It also took 20 minutes for me to get a spoon for my soup. I don’t recommend coming to this location until they are properly staffed.</Review>< pictures>

I enjoyed visiting Brueggers while here on a trip. We came every morning as a family.  Today, 9/5/17 at 7:35 in the morning I came in one last time and accidentally left my iphone on the counter.  I came back minutes later    frantic stating that I left it.  They acknowledged that I did, and then calmly stated that a customer took my phone with him.  They said that they asked him to give it to them, but he said no so they let him walk out with it.  THEY ALLOWED HIM TO STEAL MY PHONE.  They would not give me a description of what the man looked like.  When i asked the lead person why they let him take it, The lead said , "What do you want me to do,  go him fight for it"?"  I said they could have reminded him that he was stealing and that they will call the police if he took it?  They knew he was taking a phone that did not belong to him but did not bother to do anything to prevent it. There was a crime committed in the store and they allowed it to happen

I asked to speak to their manager, a man named Rudolofo.  I explained that his people were not supporting me by giving me a description of the person who took the phone.  He said that they are busy selling bagels and cannot.  I asked why they didn't alert him that a crime was occurring.  He shrugged his shoulders and smiled at me and said they were too busy helping customers.  There was little to no one in line when I went in the first time and the second time.  They were not too busy to help me.

I finally called Paul, the owner, and he said he was sorry he didn't know why they behaved that way.

He didn't bother to take my information until I suggested he take it.<//Review>

It's all made from scratch and very tasty. This ice cream has been my favorite so far. This is a delicious dark chocolate and orange ice cream.</text>

I love Marco Polo and will go out of my way to go here. The ice cream tastes super fresh, and like it's made with quality ingredients. My favorite part is that they have such a wide range of flavors, especially Asian and SE Asian flavors (taro, durian, black sesame, etc.). They also offer unconventional drink combinations (like a coconut ice cream + sprite for example). Well worth the trip!</Review>

<Review>This is not your typical ice cream.  The ice cream is creamy  yet not too sweet.  My daughter loves leechy flavor and so do I.  We always stop by here after lunch.  Highly recommend it.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><text>The place is a commute for us coming from the north. But I think it's worth the time and the effort to go there. There are so many different fruit flavors that you will not see in other creameries or ice cream places. The block sesame seed was just awesome and very unique in its taste. I could Rave and rant about all the flavors but you will never know until you get the experience of tasting the different flavors that they have.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>I love the durian and soursop ice cream here. I also like the jackfruit one! Taste them all! I first started liking Marco Polo in SF when my friend would buy pints of durian ice cream to bring home. I learned why! Their ice cream is soft and you can still taste pieces of fruit from it especially the soursop. The flavors are perfect.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808fccd57b337535:0x20a3a3d0d8095d4b</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Marco Polo is a good place if you're hankering for a gelato shop with fun Asian flavors.  This location is at an edge of The Shops at Vietnam Town - the largest Vietnamese Plaza in California, or so the sign says.

I sampled nearly every fun flavor and settled upon the Thai Iced Tea and the Taro in a cup for $5.50 for two flavors, though tempted by the Banana Walnut and Lychee.  Meanwhile, a non-Asian family ordered their Double Chocolate, Mocha Chip, Vanilla, and Strawberry.  So the options are there.

Water was available against the wall - just ask for a cup.  A bathroom was tucked down the hall.  Limited seating<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place. This is actually one of my top 5 favorite ice cream shop in the Bay Area. They have unique Asian flavors such as durian (my favorite), lychee, mangosteen and jackfruit to name the few. It's on the pricier side but you get real pieces of fruit in the ice cream. Yum!</review>

I really liked the durian flavor. The durian was very apprant and the kind of durian they used tasted creamy. I could feel bits of durian in it, so most likely they used real durian. Im not a fan of soursop, but the flavor was subtle so it wasn't too bad.<//Text>

Fantastic quality gelato, but what really outs this over the top is the unique flavors. If this was a typical gelato store, it would be 4 stars in terms of quality. But the 5 star comes from the Asian influence in their flavors: durian, black sesame, taro, etc. Super unique for gelato and absolutely delicious!< /review>

It is really all homemade and good, the fruit flavor really comes through using ingrediants that don't taste locally sourced at all.  Amazing fruit flavors!</review>

< Review>
Honestly the best gelato in San Jose and maybe even in the entire Bay Area! Lots of tropical fruit flavors, and all come with real fruit inside. For fruit flavors, I particularly loved the lychee and durian. Other flavors I recommend:
-Thai iced tea, strong Thai Tea flavor
-Taro (made with taro and coconut so it's a bit grainy, the same texture of real taro. Ans it was super soft because of the coconut
-Coffe cognac, do NOT miss this if you are a coffee lover. I may or may not be biased because coffee is amongst my Top 3 favorite flavors

I cannot recommend this place enough and cannot wait to come back!!

Tip:
1) Try as many samples as you want (if not busy)
2) $10 minimum for credit cards (each small, 1-2 flavors, is $5.20)< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>In A Nutshell:

-So happy that the owners decided to open a SoBay (South Bay) location.
-What I like about Marco Polo (cool name and all) is the exotic South East Asian fruit flavors (i.e. mangosteen, durian, soursop, guava, jackfruit, lychee, etc...).
-Everything about this place is simple and clean.  The layout is definitely a lot more fancier than the SF store, but I could care less as long as the ice cream still tastes the same.

Overall, as it continually trends warmer in California, I'll continually make my way to Marco Polo (and I don't even like sweets).  Grab some!</text>< pics>

2nd time coming here it's really good! For the flavors they have I would say they would appeal to the Asian audience more.< /Review>

Super cool park. Plenty of parking, including on street. The sidewalks wind through the park and the neighborhood so you can get in a really nice walk with your buddies. Lots of trees and a cool atmosphere.<//text>

< Review>
This is a large (20 acres), beautiful park serving a large variety of needs. Here you'll find a kids' playground, bbqs, softball and baseball fields, tennis and basketball courts, a skate park, and plenty of parking.  There are also restrooms.  Bbq areas can be reserved for large groups.  The park has a nice variety of mature trees.  It's the perfect place for a family outing.  The Claremont Youth Activity Center and Taylor Hall are also located here.</Review>

The skate park leaves something to be desired, but it is a good place for novice skaters.< /review>< Pics>

Wonderful place to hang out with your friends, have parties, sit in the shade, watch softball, or just play.  The playground was updated about 3 years ago, and it was way better than the old one.  I recommend you go here.</Text>

<Review>Grew up in and around this park. I wanted to raise my own kids here but didn't have to. I helped raise several families children in.Claremont and took them there until they had minds of their own. And were allowed to express themselves and make their own choices. Still then, some were still attracted to that park. Funny things and fun times. Safe place and in a great neighborhood.</Review>< Pictures>

The Park is actually bigger than I thought. It has several professional tennis courts, basketball courts and a big field for baseball soccer/football. The playground has plenty of space for children to run  around.</Text>

<Review>TutorMe is one of those rare online platforms which care about true learning of students. I have been tutoring with them for a while now and would highly recommend it to all my students and fellow tutors. The pay here for tutors is on an hourly basis and is very good. Also, the student flow is high here as many universities have chosen this platform for their students. Moreover, tutors can choose to tutor whenever they are available (24 X 7).

I love the fact that they focus on helping students understand concepts rather than offering quick fix solutions for their assignments.<//Review></record>

<user>105500224301282314163</user><Review>Tutoring with TutorMe has been such a phenomenal experience. Getting to see students grow each step of the way through this platform has been great for me because I feel as if I am giving back to many different communities. In a time of a pandemic this is extremely beneficial for students struggling with virtual learning, and especially struggling in such important courses such as basic math and science.< /Review></record>

I've worked with middle schoolers through adults, and each of the interactions has been really wonderful. The students work hard and collaborate with the tutor to learn new information. Also, the platform works very well so that there aren't any delays in audio or in the screen-sharing features.<//Review>< pictures>

I tried tutorme for the first homework assignment to get used to it.
I am not exaggerating when I say I have used a tutor for every assignment since. I learn as much from the tutors as I do in class. I love learning with multiple perspectives!< /review>< Pics>

<text>The platform is really helpful.
It allowed me to find help in different subjects (Calculus I and II, Physics, Literature). Every mentor I met has been really helpful. They don’t do your homework, they teach you how to do it. Which I think is what really matters.
I would 100% recommend the site if you are struggling in any class.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb417de044ef:0xeda4b79776723894<//Gmap_id><Name>Jorge Menacho< /Name><Resp>None</Resp><pictures>None</pictures>< UserId.>

<Review>I have really enjoyed being a tutor on TutorMe.com. The platform is easy to use for my students and myself, as a tutor. I like the tutoring support and functions on the site. It allows me to teach to the best of my ability to the way I see fit to the students; linked to google drive,  uploading files, and easy to share material. Teachers receive money for the time they are on with the students. I enjoy the flexibility and independence of my schedule.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2bb417de044ef:0xeda4b79776723894< /gmapID>< pictures>

<Review>I currently work as a tutor on TutorMe and so far I love it! The staff is super nice and once you get hired, the process to get started is pretty easy! I also think it’s a great platform for students! I wish something like this existed when I was in school! I’m so glad I get to interact with students and really feel like I’ve helped them understand a concept or problem!<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>TutorMe is a wonderful platform for tutors because it offers convenience. Tutors do not have to stick to a certain schedule. However, they are free to work according to their own convenience. The platform is amazing in terms of the tools available during sessions that are really helpful.< /Review>< pics>

One of the things I like about tutorme, is how humble the tutors are with you. They understand that you are wanting the best grade possible, but they give you sound advice for that to happen. I'm holding strong to a 4.0 GPA for my masters in psychology, and it's all thanks to tutorme. The only change I would say is to give more time than 45 mins, that seems to go fast when they are trying to help you. Would rather getting a "would you like more time, yes or no" option, instead of booting you off and hoping you get the same tutor back.< /Text>

I’m a tutor through this platform, and I absolutely love it. Being able to help people from the comfort of my own home, and in my free time, makes me feel whole again. Due to the pandemic I can’t be in person with my music students and being able to tutor gives me almost the same fulfillment that teaching does. They are also very clear about everything and extremely helpful to new tutors.</review>

I'm a college student taking math 1090, I was really struggling with my math. I had the best time with my tutor, she was more than willing to work with me and help for hours at a time. I have tried other platforms of tutoring, but nothing has worked as well as TutorMe. I recommend it 5/5. The tutors have great communication skills, are knowledgeable, and patient. They are kind and more than willing to work with your schedule.< /review>

TutorMe is a great company to work for. Their tutoring platform is user friendly making it easy to communicate and collaborate with students. The pay could be better, but is offset by the ability to work from home and the flexibility of scheduling work time. Their technical support is excellent which is important when working remotely. I love working for this company and being able to assist students with their library and research questions.</review>

I have been a tutor for TutorMe for a few weeks now and I am loving it! Students who use the platform are looking for real assistance, so every time I help someone and get their heartfelt thanks, it makes me feel like I am truly making a different in their lives.

TutorMe has been a super lifesaver for me. As an online student who works full time, I am never able to get help from my professors since I am not home during their open hours. Being able to log in 24/7 and get help from someone experienced and talk through the material has helped me not to fail Chemistry.  I love TutorMe and I'd recommend it to anyone.</review>

<Review>I have been a Biology and Writing tutor with TutorMe since 2016. This is a great company to work with. They respond quickly to their tutors and help solve problems when needed. TutorMe pays on time and gives notice if payment will be delayed due to banking holidays.  I have enjoyed my time with TutorMe more than other companies I have tutored with. The company has even recently added the background check on tutors which goes to show this company looks out for its tutors and the students. I highly recommend this company!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb417de044ef:0xeda4b79776723894<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Review>My school (Salish Kootenai College) offers this service for free which I consider to be an amazing resource, a wonderful gift to their students. I have had sort of hit or miss experiences with tutors. If I had to pay for this service myself I probably would not. That is, sometimes I've asked tutors for help with homework and they miss my mistakes or make mistakes themselves. On the upside, I have found some really wonderful tutors on this site. And I find the 24/7 accessibility to be incredible, super conducive to when I actually study/run into questions! At TutorMe, like most things I find in life, there are both pros and cons. :)<//Review>< date>

<Review>This tutoring program has been a blessing. Each tutor seems to care genuinely about my needs and not just a time to get paid. They break it down as simple as I need it. Nothing is ever rushed, and there is typically little wait time for a tutor.<//Review><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

I am a tutor on TutorMe. I am very impressed with the screening process. It does take some time after you apply and they are very selective so I feel privileged to have been chosen as a Professional for Library Sciences. The training was excellent and staff are very good at responding to my questions and suggestions about the platform so that in turn I can give the best service to the users.</Review>

< Review>
As a newer tutor on TutorMe, I can attest to the high standard of quality and service. The lesson space is equipped with several useful tools that are easy to practice in the demo lesson space. TutorMe regulations are clear and easy to follow and are designed to promote the integrity and success of each tutoring session for both the tutors and the students. The administrators make communication a priority without being overbearing or annoying. Although the payment per session is lower than some other tutoring services, the ease of use and commitment to high quality experiences for both tutor and student more than make up the difference.<//Review>

After a long day of attending back to back online classes, doing Master's level coursework and presenting in graduate seminars, it's no surprise that the best part of my day is logging into TutorMe and helping high school and college students get to where I am!

Tutoring at Tutorme has probably been my most engaging experience thus far, even as comparable as tutoring in person if I do say so myself. As someone who has tutored with other platforms, nothing compares to the user-friendliness and ease of the TutorMe lesson space. And the fact that the whiteboard is interactive, gets stored after a lesson so you can access it on your own time is a huge plus!

In these times when in-person meetings have been indefinitely suspended, TutorMe proves you don't need to be physically present to properly hold a tutoring session!<//Text>

Easy process to get connected with a tutor. They are able to show you work on the whiteboard and you can save the whiteboard as a pdf for later. It’s best when the tutor is able to use the microphone, otherwise it can take a long time to get through the tutoring. Overall easy process and nice tutors< /text>

I love TutorMe, it has helped me a lot in the past and helps me a lot currently (taking Organic Chemistry II). My only complaint is sometimes it glitches out, and I get disconnected from my lesson, but it always once that happens it lets me know that I won’t be charged since my session was interrupted. Customer service/IT/help desk respond within 24 hours as well.

TutorMe will for sure help you out through school, whether it’s college or high school; the live tutors work with you in your problems step by step, and even ask you comprehension questions when you finish so they know you understand.<//Review>

Working with TutorMe has been an exhilarating experience and I genuinely enjoy the flexibility of working with the company. All of the students are extremely respectful and show genuine interest in the things that I love doing. I love this job because I'm able to teach students things that I love and with genuine enthusiasm. As a student I feel that it's best to be taught by someone who loves what they do and it's an experience that I wish to give other students. The only downside to working here is that sometimes there are too many tutors and not enough students.<//Text>

<Text>I've worked at TutorMe for a couple of months and have really enjoyed it thus far! The job is completely remote and flexible based on your schedule, so you can work whenever you want and as much or as little as you want. You can choose a variety of topics to tutor in and most of the students are really open and easy to work with. My position as a Virtual Librarian helps to keep up my reference interview skills while job searching and as a writing tutor, I get to help both ELL and other students with their writing skills.

The tutoring software is really easy to use, but I wish it was more customizable. There are some features related to math tutoring that aren't relevant to my tutoring and sometimes get in the way. I also wish the pay was a bit better. It is $16 an hour, but that is all dependent on which students you actually get and how long your tutoring session is. When there are too many tutors on and not enough students, it can be really difficult to claim jobs.

Overall, I really enjoy working at TutorMe! The supervisors for both the Writing Lab and the Library have been fantastic and supportive. Their training is quick and easy, but really helpful, too. I really enjoy the flexibility of working around my schedule and having the extra help. I think this is a great "side gig" that, if you are quick and dedicated, can be the main gig.<//Text>< pics>

User interface is very simple to use, customer support is fast and payments are hassle free! The approach of learning is focused on knowledge rather than giving away just answers. I would recommend universities/schools to tie up with TutorMe! They also give free trials to explore the platform before you go for a plan. Happy learning :)

TutorMe is a great company to work with. Pay is good and on time. I really enjoy the flexibility and freedom. The students are grateful and will support you.  Tutors do not have to work with multiple students at a time and need to respond to them. Management is awesome and support staff are courteous. They do not send weekly/monthly complaints about your tutoring.

Trust me, TutorMe is worth it.< /Text>

Tutor me is a very good platform for both students as well as tutors/teachers of any country. You just need your PC to start an exciting and awesome journey.
This is very helpful specially for those students who hesitates to ask questions in the classroom. Here you may ask any thing to your tutor without any hesitation and believe me your tutor will answer and help you in every problem.
Tutor me has helped me a lot financially during this time of Covid. I used to teach my students in a classroom but due to Covid, I was unable to do the same. Tutor me has given me a platform to enhance my knowledge and keep me in touch with students around the Globe.
At the last I just want to say.
Thank You!!! Tutor me & Team.< /Review>

<Review>Life saving site!  I am a night owl, and the fact that someone is available for me at even 1am in the morning is incredible! I love my tutor, Vishesh G! He's the best! I got him on a roll of the dice, and I got really lucky! He makes the problems simple and easy.  I can favorite my favorite tutors and When Vishesh isn't available I have backups that are also good.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I've had nothing but good experiences with tutorme. The tutors are so knowledgeable and helpful. I have one that I just love. Ashley S. has been helpful from the beginning. She is so understanding and patient. She listens to what I have to say and then we move from there. I wish I had of known about this last year when I was struggling with math. It would been so helpful and I probably would've been done with all of my schooling by now. Thank you so much tutorme for all the help.< /Text>

<Review>I've been a Tutor at TutorMe for over a year now. I must say that it has been an enriching experience. TutorMe is revolutionizing students' learning experience with its cutting-edge virtual learning space. The team is young and full of energy and passion, and I can see our effort manifest in tremendous growth. Over this year, I've seen demand grow considerably and students' retention as well. I can't wait to see where this journey will take us!< /Review><pics>None<//pics></record>

<text>The best online meeting place for tutor and students. It provides a very systematic approach of conducting online lesson for both tutor and student. The payment system is very fast and the amount of commission is decreasing dynamically with increase in number of lessons. Everything from  setting availability to conducting lesson is awesome with great online support. The mobile app is also very useful in communicating fast with tutor and student. Fully recommended to every tutor and student of this world. It is a revolution in the field of education.<//text><time>1583264548288</time>< username>

Good interface to connect with students as a tutor, with useful features such as screensharing, multiple whiteboards, a code editor, and Google Docs integration. All sessions also have audio and video capabilities if the student and tutor agree to use those. Can be difficult at times to obtain sessions as a tutor because they are taken very quickly, so be prepared to claim a lesson as soon as you see it even before knowing what the student needs help on. Tutors receive a standard hourly rate for tutoring that is somewhat low in comparison to what I would charge for private tutoring and also significantly lower than what students actually pay per hour; though it seems they have their hands full with complaints from students regarding pricing.<//Review>

Tutorme is a great resource to have for someone like me that does my school work int he middle of the night. I have immediate access to knowledgeable tutors in several courses 24/7!!
It gives me peace of mind having knowledgeable, patient, and friendly tutors a click away. I am always matched with a tutor that suites my subject and they work with me to ensure all questions are answered.< /Review>

TutorMe is an excellent tutoring company. The company looks after both the tutors and students! I have had a great experience being a tutor. I love the fact that the hours are flexible and based on the tutors availability. Also, I love that we are paid weekly for tutoring! Anytime I had a question or needed help with anything the company is quick with their response. They also do an awesome job with making improvements in the database to make tutoring even more beneficial for students. Overall, I have had great outcomes being a tutor and have gained many requests from students I've previously tutored.</Text>

I am currently a new student at Ashford, doing my MBA. Week 1 of school, I was struggling with my assignment, and the night before it was due, I decided to go on tutor me. My tutor Rohn connected with me and worked with me for over 2 hrs. He was very patient and even persevered through the technical difficulties I was having with my computer. He even schedules a lesson for the next morning to do a final run through my assignment and proofread before uploading it. Now I only connect with him because of his level of service given. And guess what? My studies were all 100%. You go, Rohn A. Tutor me is very lucky to have you as a tutor. Tutor me is a great platform. I recommend it. Don't miss it. Skip the assignment when you can use tutor me.< /review>

TutorMe has been a great way to earn extra cash. It is convenient, easy to use, and flexible. Unlike other tutoring sites, the students are not spamming you or wanting you to do the work for them. This is a legitimate tutoring experience. Additionally, customer care is very quick to respond to any messages. Would recommend for both tutors and students!</Text>

<Text>I love TutorMe! I have been providing tutoring and instruction for the past 6 mos. or so. There is always a good volume of students, and I have had only positive experiences.

I deduct one star (which feels a bit harsh because I have had such a great experience thus far) because the platform is not supported on tablets or phones. Moreover, you cannot even receive messages from students on your devices. Many of my fellow freelancers will primarily work from tablets at this point, and will understand the frustration. I have to borrow my wife’s computer anytime I want to tutor. This is not the end of the world, but I could easily triple my tutoring volume if I could use my tablet (let alone my phone). Hopefully this is something which can be rectified in the future.

All this said, my experience has been very positive, and I heartily recommend TutorMe!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

TutorMe has been a blessing to me. Returning to college at age 47, TutorMe has been my best friend while attending classes. Each and every tutor has been not only happy to help me, but has answered my questions and helped me through the problems I needed help with. BEST.TUTORING.EVER.</text>

<Review>I like that I can use my audio during a tutor session and that I can preview before I accept the session. I always use it at like 10 pm or later and chemistry is harder to find a tutor but a math tutor is always available. It sends you a overview of the session you just had emailed to you as well if you forgot to write something down.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

TutorMe is an innovative and easy-to-use platform that has made delivering helpful instructions to students amazingly easy! The tutoring workspace has an awesome variety of tools that make any problem easy to solve. In fact, most of the lessons I give are without webcam/microphone usage because their tools make relaying information and fleshing out problems incredibly easy. They are also continuously updating their platform and are super responsive to insight on how their service could be improved; TutorMe is constantly getting better and easier to use, I wouldn't recommend any other service!</text>

As a history major, I love showing people the value of history. As a Ph.D. student, I also need the time to work on my history work. At TutorMe, I get both. I get to work my hours and teach history to those who need my help. Sometimes, I end up learning a thing or two. I would definitely recommend working here.</review>

If someone is considering joining the team, my advice would be to put your heart into every session—a short tutoring session can easily turn into the highlight of your day!"<//Review>< Pictures>

Extremely flexible for both students and tutors. A tutor like me can easily decide how much time I wish to devote to it, and how much it is worth. A student getting the benefits of the tutor's knowledge can first gauge his abilities, then ascertain if he/she wishes to continue with that particular tutor or not. Extremely convenient pricing, which is attractive to both tutors and students.<//Review>

This is hands down my favorite tutoring company to work with. They actually care about their tutors and improving aspects of the site, as well as tutor-student interactions. They are always willing to answer questions and always asking for feedback on how to improve. There are some things that could be improved in terms of UI, but they improve every week. I hope they keep listening to feedback so they can expand and reach even more students (more clients)!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Flexible, fun, and easy! TutorMe is an easy to use platform that allows educators to work online from any location and at their own pace. Tutors simply sign into their TutorMe account when they want to work and the system's algorithms match the students to the correct tutor in that subject. Tutors get paid by the hour for time spent working with a student (not for the wait times) and the money is deposited weekly into a PayPal account. All-in-all a pretty easy way to make some extra money tutoring students and it is also a great way to stay active in your subject area.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Before covid me and my wife really like going to the tutor center on campus. But to be honestly I REALLY like this better. With this tutorme I dont have to wait on a available tutor to help me. Before, it was hard to find time to get in with the tutor because of work or classes. Now its the other way around. I can get sign in when I have time from my desk at home and see a tutor whenever I want to. I like the fact I can reach to the same tutor every time for help. A simple message to them to see when they are available and thats it! OH! you can save the lessons so you can go back to them which I LOVE so much! Once this covid is over with I would still use this.</Review><time>1603650848836<//time><resp>None</resp><user_name>zach favela</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

You get to pick your own hours, and work from home, so that's great. The platform is easy to use. I haven't run into any problems so far. Although there aren't as many students, so you don't get as many hours. It's great as a part-time job.< /Review>

<text>TutorMe has been immensely helpful so far for my online degree. It’s been a hard transition for traditional college to all online, and TutorMe has been a great help for when I need extra help.

Most of the tutors are great and very helpful. A few times I’ve gotten a tutor who either doesn’t quite get the question I posted, or their response takes so long that answering one question takes almost an hour. But again, overall I’ve had a good experience and will continue using.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Tutorme is a very innovative and friendly platform to tutor on. From voice chat to typed chat to video interaction, there is a option for everyone. I thoroughly enjoy tutoring on here as the students are friendly and ready to learn.  The only downside that I found is there could be some downtime when there are more students than tutors. You have to be fast! But overall, a great experience!<//Text>< Pictures>

TutorMe is the best website I have ever used as a tutor. I have truly enjoyed the platform and the interactions with new students. I plan on using the platform often in the future. I want to thank the founders of TutorMe for providing tutors with such a great opportunity!<//Text>

However, I do like a lot of features - such as the ability to send screenshots - that it has. It works for what students need, and could be a really nice product with minor modifications. They make tutoring easy, in that you get paid via PayPal and don't need to deal with tax paperwork, etc (although you have to remember to pay taxes at the end of the year!). The flexibility of not having a set schedule is wonderful. Great way to make some money "on the side."< /Text>< user>

The most telling detail of this new (relatively) online tutoring service is their utter similarity to some of their contemporaries. And while such is a sincere imitation, the lack of fundamental updates in the form of written lessons in tandem with live sessions for the standard students makes it very difficult for revenue to be generated evenly.

To this end, I also suggest a more robust communication system, as a student following up on initial messages sent to potential tutors is the exception rather than the rule. Add in a rather apparent sampling of international students with time zone differences and actual sessions are few and far between...

Do not continue down the road of decline that is CourseHero, as your strengths are quite prominent; they just need some fine tuning. Students would likely benefit from such changes just as readily as the tutors.<//Text>

<text>Tutorme is a great online tool for students and tutors, highly recommend. As an active tutor in the platform, I see how tutoring affects students' performance in their academic success, especially because of the live-action virtual tutoring room tools! It provides everything a tutor needs to explain a topic (Which makes it better for students)! Love it.</text>< Pics>

You want the blunt truth? Here, let me tell you how my experience has been with TutorMe. Most of the time, you will run into companies that don't care about you as an individual and you will feel so worthless only to be left with the feeling of why work for the company. But for the 4 years I have tutored for TutorMe, I have noticed that this isn't the case at all. They become a part of your tutoring experience. Keeping you update with the latest news, payment situations, student-related issues and always open to a simple conversation. They will grow along side of you if you give them 100%. TutorMe communicates with you on a gentle yet direct approach. Sure, no company is perfect, but once you get past that idea, then you learn to just work for the pure idea of wanting to make a difference and along the way you have a company who desires to be on the same page as you. It's a share a picture of your newborn baby or roast a bag of coffee kind of relationship I have with the company. TutorMe strives to provide a positive environment for all who click onto its platform. The lesson space is easy to access and become knowledge about. The admins are efficient in answering questions.  The technology is always improving. The IT guys are working on bugs immediately when they are reported. And how do I know? I ask. I'm aware. The company wants you to be a valuable resource to its business. Love you, guys.< /Text>

Working at tutorme has been great! Still relatively new at it but I love how flexible it is and there’s always work no matter what time you go on. There’s a bunch of different subjects you can tutor in and I like the features the platform provides (I.e. whiteboard, graphs, video/audio etc) pay is good and super flexible time commitment! Definitely recommend.<//Text>

They are the only reason I made an A in A&P2. So many concepts were broken down and explained in real world applications to make my understanding of them more complete. The flexible schedule and pay rates were also a huge benefit. The only downside would be that the ASL tutors are never online and the ONE that is doesn't really know ASL.</text>

<review>I work as the evening reference librarian for a local community college, so what is important to me is empowering students with the knowledge of how to search for and verify the accuracy of information. Unfortunately I don't always get to work with students at the beginning of projects, when that knowledge would be at most use, which is my preference. What I appreciate so much about a service like TutorMe is that I get to work with students at the beginning of projects. The plugin for Google Chrome alerts me whenever a student needs assistance, and allows me to communicate via chat, audio, video, and even share my screen to demonstrate something for the student. It means a lot to me to have supplemental work that ties into the career I studied for, with some Writing and English tutoring on the side. TutorMe also makes it easy to be compensated for my work, and allows for direct deposit into bank account or credit card, via through PayPal. I would highly recommend this service for those wanting to teach or to learn.</review>< Pictures>

I have been working on tutorme for last one year. And i found it wonderful to work on this website. Everything here is perfect like management, students, payment on time. Also the work space is wonderful, you always enjoy to teach students there in a friendly mood. And the most important thing is that the hourly rate is great, I don't think anyone else is giving that price. I will strongly recommend tutorme me both for students and teachers. Because it is the right place where you can get highly qualified teacher, 24/7 available for assist and teacher can make good money if they have knowledge of some subjects and can deliver it. 5 Stars from my side honestly for this website.< /Text>

Not a bad place for a tutor to make some extra change now and then. Definitely not sustainable as a primary job, though. There are not many opportunities and they are gone within seconds if you don't click fast enough. The pay is unreasonable, because tutors only make $16 an hour while the company charges $39 an hour! They also persuade you to post reviews for them on multiple websites for a "chance" to win a gift card.</text>

<Review>I was looking to make some extra money and my field has fairly limited opportunities for that. I saw a post that TutorMe was looking for new hires in my field, and applied after looking through the profiles of others on TutorMe in my area of expertise. I like that I can login and, if timing permits, make some extra money doing interesting work that helps students succeed. I also appreciated in their orientation packet the expectation of high ethical standards and that students wouldn't have work done for them. That's meaningful for me, especially since I know other companies (e.g., paper mills) do that kind of stuff - that goes against the grain for me, and I'm happy TutorMe is way better than those other services. It's about learning, helping others succeed, and sharing expertise. Love it!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I've said this before, I'll say it again! TutorMe was so helpful and I passed my intermediate algebra class with a B! I didn't think I could pass. I had my favorite tutors, but they were all great. YOU NEED TO USE TUTORME!<//Text>

<text>I was all set to sing the praises of tutorme.com - the platform is very user-friendly, I enjoy the interaction with the students, my experience has been nothing but enjoyable. Until today, 3/20/2020, when I went to log into the system and told my application was rejected - after having been approved as a tutor in January 2020, and tutoring weekly since then.  When I emailed support, Laura responded with, "We are very sorry to hear that you were unsatisfied with your account suspension. As you may know, we pride ourselves on providing excellent quality to our students and, as such, we maintain strict quality assurance policies. Please note that the suspension of your account does not affect your payments and any outstanding payments for work you have completed will be paid per the usual schedule. While we are unable to provide further details regarding your account suspension, if you have further questions regarding outstanding payments, please email us directly".  Huh? I emailed back asking for guidance on who would be able to provide details, as well as direction where I could find verbiage indicating such a suspension was a possibility.  I have yet to receive a response.  I am frustrated and disappointed.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Great site to work for, lots of students looking for help in statistics and psychology (the subjects I tutor in), convenient interface, timely pay, good assistance from site staff. Potential improvements might be opportunities to conduct written lessons, higher pay for tutors, ability for students to leave written feedback about lessons.< /review>

I love working for Tutorme, it allows me to be a full-time student with a job, while also being able to earn extra on the side with this site. It's a very competative market for tutors, which does tend to make it difficult to claim a decent amount of lessons, but the flexibility of the site makes it worth it. Also to note, the site itself is very well thought out and makes it easy to tutor using various methods for the various types of learners I encounter. I love meeting new students and being able to see the concepts 'click' for them, and Tutorme makes that possible. (Written for a chance to win a gift card)< /Text>

<text>It is extremely helpful, but is quite time consuming. Make sure to use this service when you have time. 10 minutes before an exam may do more harm then help. When used correctky Tutor Me is extremly benifical and something that i suggest every student adds to their arsenal of educatinaol tools.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) TutorMe is a platform that allows you to learn and share your knowledge among members of your community. Learn if it has a cost but the classes are personalized, that is a student a teacher. The teacher can win by sharing his knowledge. Very interesting while learning too much whether you are a student or teacher

<gmapID>0x80eab804f7f60e85:0xf5fd64133b199d4b<//gmapID><Text>An amazing chocolate/candy/coffee shop! So glad I made the trip from Fresno to Porterville. Friendly staff and such a huge selection--a wider variety of chocolate treats than at the local See's candies, in my opinion. It was hard to choose what items to try. I left with a gift box, salted caramels, cute hedgehog shaped chocolates, and 6 truffles. Downtown Porterville is a nice place to walk around and it is definitely a must to stop at Stafford's.< /Text><time>1614017264062< /time><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<name>Kristan Bradley< /name><time>1611890250828<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>Growing up in Porterville, Stafford's was a great place to stop by for a treat. My grandmother would buy a ton of chocolate for our entire family during the holidays there. Larry was always so nice to us when we would pop in. Recently looked around for a Birthday surprise for my mom that could be delivered. She had been diagnosed with Covid-19 so, we could could not be with her on her Birthday. I was able to easily order online. Stafford's delivered her turtles to her a day after they were ordered, her Birthday. It made her day just a little more special. Thank you for giving great service. It is much appreciated and you will have a customer for life.< /text>< pics>

Great chocolates and service. Very yummy and fresh! Have given these chocolates and candies as gifts several times and they are always well received.  The people who work here are so pleasant and helpful, just great service. They have several family owned businesses on the Central Coast as well, in San Luis Obispo (Mama Ganache)  and Solvang (Swedish Candy Factory).</review>

Nice staff but the the chocolate is not as amazing as it used to be and a little over priced for 1/2 pound of chocolate which is only 6 pieces for 22 dollars need to improve on the chocolate before they charge more<//text>

The best place for chocolates and coffee!!! The wife was craving a moon pie. Without a doubt the most flavorful moon pie I've ever had the pleasure of chowing down on. The elegant notes of spices accent the delicious milky chocolate topped off with the fluffy marshmallow center!!! Mah gooooooooooush it truly is a delight. The Irish Cream Truffle is everything you want in Irish Cream. Smooth, creamy chocolate to start. Sweet, Irish Cream flavor to finish. Aaaaaamazzzziiiinnng!!!!! The Peanut Butter Mummy Truffle is packed with rich peanut butter and a thick, creamy white chocolate that is a pleasure to the pallet!!! An awesome googley-eyed addition to their already deliciously presented arsenal! Give it a try and be smothered by their enticing endulgances!!!!!<//Review>

Frozen bananas were excellent  But they nred to give you the whole banana not just the middle section. They're expensive for what you get. But the Apples were BOMB as always.</text>

Wonderful local chocolate shop.  I could watch them dip chocolate,  peanut butter,  and Carmel dipped apples all day.  With the viewing window and plenty of seating,  this is a sweet stop with coffee on top. Great gift ideas for all occasions.< /text>

< Review>
I like it better than See's candy when it comes to chocolates. And their Affogato is amazing. UPDATE: Stafford's is truly a gem in Porterville. This is my go to for chocolate, coffee, and even just to relax. I love the atmosphere of Stafford's. Oh, and don't forget about open mic night and music night.</Review>

An old world chocolatier, producing a wide assortment of hand-dipped morsels. The trendy shop in an historic building on Main Street Porterville has large windows to view the magic in the kitchen and cafe tables to savor your treats while you sip on a latte made with freshly ground coffee.  Try the oat milk lattes.  You can also take a bag of fresh coffee beans home, or have them grind them for you. My go to store for gifts and souvenirs. The staff is friendly and accomodating.</Text>

Cuts good hair at times but the last time I went the older gentlemen messed up my lineup really bad. I would recommend to give specific details on how you want your haircut because they might make a mistake.</Text>

<review>My husband has a bad experience recently here, the barber knicked him several times and slap the shaving cream on him like who does that. Not professional at all... I rate this place a ZERO...... DIRTY environment also....< /review>< Pics>

If there was an issue with someone bring nicked I would've been happy to address it. You could have talked to instead of going on Google. We've been here for 39 years without incident but Google doesn't flag suspicious reviews. Is that why you used Google and not yelp?

Worst haircut of my life. Barber does not listen to requests and just cuts hair off randomly. Lots of choppy sections and wobbly lines. I’m honestly amazed that anyone would give more than 2 stars.</text>

I've been coming here for 7 years and I got to say the staff here are very friendly and help you through the process of donating!! I like coming here and for 1st time donors you will make a good amount within the 1st couple of weeks regardless of your weight!!..plus good thing is the incentives for coming they hook you up with extra money..worth it!!< /Review>

They slow af here. Whatever you do don’t bother showing up on a Friday unless you have all day to be here. Cause it’s going to take 3-4 hours before your done.</Review>

There’s an employee that wears a visor about Zombies, Do not let her stick you! Aside from being unkind her sticks hurt like hell and are soo uncomfortable! Then she blames the donor and asks if we’re moving or pumping on returns? No ma’am you may just need retraining.
Rest of the staff is kind & well trained.< /text>

Although I'm a regular donor, meaning I donate atleast twice a month, these people confuse the hell out of me! First they say to "donate every other day" yet when I went to donate for a third time in one week, they turned me down. They claim they need my second donation or they can't use the first donation, but won't take my third? Senseless.</Review>

This place horrible. The good reviews for this place are complete BS. Either it’s someone who is related or is a friend of someone who works there. Or some kind of favorite donor. An to say that the staff have no favorites is a lie. I’ve watched them manually change a donors information so that they’ll pass an watch them fail others. I’ve seen them set up donors for the beginning of the donation or finalization of it while making others wait. A lot of them are undertrained in the process of inserting the needle into the vein or setting up the machine to withdraw the plasma. I know people who’ve stopped going cause they don’t feel the money is worth the pain they have to go through. Plus the employees are never truly following any sort of COVID-19 safety procedures. I always see masks half on or being taken off. Around other employees or donors. An forget about the 6 foot social distance when it comes to the masks. What is management working from home? Some an I only mean a very small handful are good at their work an are very polite. But most are not. I thought it was nice doing this, helping people an being compensated for my donation. An this extra money I was getting every week was basically just gas money or just money to put aside for a rainy day. But honestly it’s not worth the grief anymore.< /Text>

Tip: drink plenty of water and it'll reduce the donation time period.<//review><Time>1614465193154< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80dcad2466be2fad:0x552515fd2573b217< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have gone as many times as I could! I Get there before they open to limit my waiting time. I sometimes take a coffee and snack. There is a security guard that greets you and you enter to the computers. It takes 5 minutes, then get to the nurse station to weigh, test my blood protein, etc. another 5-10 minutes. Then goin into the donation room, I get seated, reclined.. I always forget my head phones... there are TVs. Then another nurse will come over and apply iodine and needed supplies to get started . Once the needle is in your vein, it is a process. If I eat well and drink a lot of water the day prior, 24 minutes... if I choose to eat bad, 2 hours and possibility of not qualifying for money. I have met people that have gone for years and have put themselves they college, bought cars, it’s an incredible opportunity... a win, win win.... you have golden blood my friend!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcad2466be2fad:0x552515fd2573b217< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I don’t mind the wait, the bruising from inexperienced techs,  however unkindness it’s not okay. I can write a book about my experience, but it doesn’t matter. Personally I’m doing this because I need the money and positive most people do also, otherwise we would go to the Red Cross where you’re treated like an asset, but don’t get $$$ only a snack. I’ve been there 3 or 4 times, first couple of times it was great until I crossed paths with Abraham and Quiana. Hope to see someone different when I go back. I’m unemployed at the moment and need money for Christmas, ☮️< /Review>

<review>You would think they would up the payments a bit more, give the donors more cash, with the whole covid-19 pandemic going on and all, I mean we're risking a lot if we do choose to donate, I called in and they pretty much said no changes in a payment increase to the amount we get when we donate so until that happens I will not be returning to donate anymore sorry, not sorry but, yeah my health and life is more important than that for the little amount that they give you. Employees are VERY RUDE so basically they can talk to you however they want and they can get away with it management is a joke always side with the rude disrespectful employees very unprofessional hope this place gets SHUT DOWN for not cleaning counters and the kiosk with the covid-19 I would give it 0 stars if I could<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcad2466be2fad:0x552515fd2573b217<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

All the staff was very helpful and polite. A very pleasant experience and rewarding knowing that my plasma will be helping others. The new facility looks very modern and updated. Very roomy and comfortable, clean and organized. It's always a pleasure speaking about Octoplasma. Thank you.</text>

The staff are nice and friendly but, a d this is a big "but", only 3 or 4 of them actually do work like they're suppose to. The rest of the staff spend most of the time talking to each other or to donors. It pains me to say these things but someone has to.< /Text>

This is a great place to go when you're are low on cash or in-between pay checks. The front of the house is kind and friendly. Jr usually does my intake and he's great!!!! The floor staff is kind as well. When the center is very busy they all tend to talk more, not sure why that is. Some staff members are more skilled and confident when it comes to venipuncture, so don't be afraid to request someone in particular.</Text>

This was my first visit here.  Jr., Erica, and Julie were fantastic and made my first visit informative and stress free.  Jr. was great!  I was a little nervous, and he helped me relax 👍.  The initial process time is lengthy, but I appreciate that because the screening is very important!< /text>

<Text>Since. Like the more you go the longer the wait time is..😡if  you will get there at 2pm you get to back  around 4 then wait for the slowest   peoples to come just to stick you either come early  in the morning  or come a 6:50 PM sadly that when they work faster to get you in and out  HIRE NEW PEOPLE  AND SHORT THE TIME  WAIT !  This why I stop coming  for a while  its getting  really ridiculous  when you begin coming for a  cool minute  and still   have wait 5 hours just like you new all over again.  Really  considering changing to a  new place< /Text>< Resp>

My first time donating, i had a very pleasant experience due to how polite and informative the staff are. They made sure i was aware, and made me feel very comfortable. Im understanding of the wait time and popularity and i recommend heading in at 6am.
Upon realizing that after your first 5 donations or so, they set you on a lower compensation rate of $25-35. So, hours of my time, stabbing me multiple times with a needle, and only receiving $25 for a vial of $500-1000 worth of plasma? No, I'm done here. This company is a true wolf, to those who need the money. 2 stars because the staff is decent(some). Other wise I'm done with Octapharma. Please, dont waste your time here for $50 a week. Its an awful process. It's not worth it. They don't tell you about the $25-35 compensation after this first 5. Please be aware.</review>

Clean facility and wonderful staff. There's a wait sometimes, but it's for a good cause and you're compensated for your time. I've been coming twice a week for the last 4 months and will continue to keep going.<//Text>

This was the managers work. I got there at 8am didn’t leave until 1pm. They let people go in front of me even though it was my first time there. Plus they only gave me $50 instead of $75 for my first time. Had to call them so they could fix it. The guy with the red hair, the manager does not know what he is doing. Scarring traumatic experience.<//text>

<text>Some of the staff are not very professional their attitudes came off a bit rude and honestly I wanted to just donate as a way to give back.. Remind the staff whatever personal issues they are having not to be unkind to others.. I am still going to donate plasma but definitely at a more professional friendly environment and location...</text>< Name>

I recently came back, l was considered a new donor. I took it for granted that it was a professional ,honest & that they stood by integrity. I called my card ,just see how much  of my new donor $ l had left & how much! I was troubled it seemed l got 50$ the last x l was there.As l listened to my card activity it said l had been paid only 25$ the last 2 x’s.I did ask the lady if l was getting my 75$ ,she informed not until the next l went.Well l went & l only got 50$. In the past l did correct the worker because l noticed that l wasn’t get paid what they said  l would.My apologies if l misunderstood.Yolanda Velarde</Text>

It’s very nice to be treated well. I recommend this place to everyone who’s not afraid of needles, lol. Come check it out...$75 on first visit!

<Text>Quiana the RN was the best very professional with such outstanding  quality of service towards her patients! The only guy really smiling and all happy with very exceptional friendly service was Chris. Yes it's true some of the staff seem like they are all depressed just avoid them and talk to the more chill people here. Every place will has it's pros and cons and this place has Quiana&Chris as their Professionals. Make sure to ask for him when you come in on early mornings I love the guy always making jokes uplifting mood compared to the other workers!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Takes to long. the workers dont care about us. They just care about the money. They take there sweet time. The only thing good about this place is they pay $75 the first donation witch is a ripoff because they sell two bottles of plasma for $1000. It should be $75 everytime.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Been coming here for years. Today they are really busy and some days are slower than others. I have never had any problem with someone sticking me. I don’t like that when you have to do an annual you do the process over like re-reading and watching the video. They make you do everything over except pay you like a new Donor for that day. Sometimes they are really under staffed. Haven’t had any problems with the staff. I love Perrin, Sandra, Sam, David, Lauren, Marisa and Julie.<//text>

<Text>Most of the staff is very rude and un professional!!! The staff would rather talk amongst themselves instead of helping donors to get in and out in a timely manner!!! If they make a mistake ( like if there phlebotomist messes up your vein or arm then you get penalized for there mistake) It is totally a waist of time. I understand if that's your only choice and way of earning a little extra cash !! If I could rate them a negative star I would! And the 1 star rating that it shows that it's there bye default<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1574452797801, 'text': 'Octapharma Plasma works hard to staff each of our donation centers with courteous, respectful, and professional employees.

<Review>Constantly always playing favorites And letting some patients talk loud on the phone, as well aS listen to music loud and without headphones. If you're there on a Sunday prepare for a long wait unless you coming super early in the AM or coming for the first time for the first time prepare to wait up to and over 5 hours ! Had to let Management know about stocking the restroom with soap, keeping it clean and having things like seat covers. But soap of all things I had l tell a medical facility about being clean and killing bacteria and having your hands clean as patients AND your male staff. Finally got fixed months later even tho seat covers are not stocked consistently.<//Review>< Response>

Nobody has pick up the phone and you only deal with an automated system. The system will tell you all associates are busy and to come into the physical location. Immediately afterwards it hangs up and gives you no way to leave a message or call back number.

<Review>Overall pleasant first experience.  David up front was super kind and helpful.  Robin was an amazing phlebotomist, I didn't even feel the needle go in.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of five was that I think first timers need to be given written instructions upon leaving.  I felt fine when I left but within 30 minutes was extremely nauseated and sweaty.  I ate and rehydrated and feel better, but I think there needs to be something giving discharge instructions.<//Review>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1541539697670, 'text': 'Hi Ashlee, Thank you for sharing your feedback and for the high star review. While most people experience little to no side effects from donating plasma, you should consult with your personal physician about any concerns. After your donation, drink plenty of water or juice to help replenish liquids in your body. Eat foods rich in protein and iron to give your body the supplemental nutrition it needs. You should also avoid strenuous exercise, tobacco use, and alcohol immediately following your donation. Your body needs time to rest and recover.

<text>3rd time donating arrived at 8:00 am and was still in line at 10:45 did not donate since i had to be at work soon and do not plan on coming back as its literally not worth the time, I dont mind helping others out but when their is 3 to 5 hour wait makes you think twice. I do not believe its the staff fault as most of them are professional and actually care and try. The problem is they are severly understaffed. They have 6 sections only 4 were open with 1 person in each. The crazy part is they were not even busy only about 10 people arrived after me within those 3 hours and somehow line had barely moved. They need to make some make some major changes soon, if i was in line for 3 hours and still was not seated while the center was basically empty i cant imagine how long that wait would be if they were actually busy. If you are thinking of donating i suggest you find a entirely different company to donate to if it's this bad at this center I doubt the others are any better.</text>< Pictures>

My first 2 visits went great because the person that put the needle in my arm did it correctly. My last 2 visits have been horrible experience because they didn't put the needle in as good and kept trying finally after sticking both arms multiple times and successful finding a vein It collapsed and I only got paid 10$ but the samething happened to my friend and they gave her the full 75$ I spoke to the manager and told her and she just gave me attitude!< /Review>

Needs more bathrooms, better staff, and definitely a new center director. This place is so ugly. If you do not have to go here then go to biomat. If you have Covid then definitely go to biomat for $100 every time.<//review>

The staff at this location are almost all courteous and helpful, even with some rude donors they maintain their composure.  The facilities are clean and there are plenty of beds.  The donation process is not complicated but because of the high volume of donors there can be a somewhat of a wait.  You're saving lives with a bonus of some payment for your blood.  If you have no fear of needles then this is a great place to donate.< /Text>

<Review>I've been coming here since October 2015 and have never had problems with the old and new locations. Staff is and always has been very friendly. Longest I've been there (not including my first visit where you register basically) was 3 hours, but that was due to my own complications. They also provide movies so that's pretty great! I only recommend bringing a jacket or a blanket because it gets cold.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< Name>

Very rude women working here. Threatened to remove me because I checked the time in my phone as the nurse was finishing up with my vitals. In no way was this action interfering with the process as stated it would be an interference for taking vitals. Well right before I checked my phone I had already been hooked up to the blood pressure machine for one cycle in which the machine set a code and I had to re-do the process.. all in which the nurse was not being courteous and i know if she was in my shoes the shoe wouldn't fit. P.s. it wasn't busy so it wasn't like the had any reason for an attitude.<//Text>

Horrible place I show up stand at the desk waiting for someone to finally take a break from there small talk to help me and she tells me new donor cut off was an hour ago when I told her there was no time on the website she then proceeds to tell me they make up a new time everyday basically. And on top of that she then tells me theres 5 people there and only one doctor and they're going to be there til ten (6 hours). This is a disgrace of a place. You need to hire better employees and have set times for things this is ridiculous. I've been to other facilities and this is by far the worst<//Text>

I've had two lady's there that have inserted my iv incorrectly. (Nursing major). They are all overall rude people and take their time. You will spend 3-4 hours just to give plasma. Go to a different location. All my experiences here have been horrible.<//Text>< Pictures>

The wait is much too long they have an uneven amount of workers  too many in the front not enough in the back or the other way around and the system in the morning is terrible instead of using all the beds they try and keep it all in the same sections you you can easily be skipped over or wait about an hour longer as I am now I am currently past my second hour on to my third and I was skipped over so if you're thinking you would like to donate here don't I would not recommend if I'm able to give 0 stars I would therefore 1 would have to do<//review>

I had a frustrating experience this last time. After having my vitals done, I was seated in a seat by itself at the end of a row, and then forgotten about. Though there were at least 15 people behind me before the doors locked at 7, I was the 2nd to last to get stuck. There were no issues. I did not get up to use the restroom or anything, yet I did not even have a sheet with a number on it for over half an hour. I watched the staff go to the sheets over and over again, pull the names in their rows, and leave the rest,(where mine sat for a long time). WHAT HAPPENED TO GOING IN ORDER? The whole thing made me want to stop coming.

Ps. Now changing my review to 1 star. These young people talk far more than actually work, which leaves people like me waiting forever, even when there was no wait out front. Ridiculous!!!!!! Go back to high school if you miss it so much.<//text>

<Review>Went in as a new donor , that was like a 3 1/2 hour process ! The staff that handled me were pretty nice & the place was pretty clean , the only bad things I would say is that the bathroom was disgusting; absolutely deplorable! Also I waited on the bed for like an additional 45 minutes to even start the donation process , the staff were too busy talking to get me started! Also when I was done I explained to them that the needle was hurting me & that it was burning & for someone to please take it out , despite my out right complaints , it took someone 10 minutes to come remove the needle from my arm !<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1505159707575, 'text': 'Hi Breanna, Thank you for sharing your feedback.

<review>I've been coming here or 6 months and it's been a decent experience. The facility is very clean (incredibly cold so bring a jacket or blanket!) and the staff has been nice and patient when helping me, I have not received any rude staff members as others have complained about.

You will wait a few hours on your first visit, so go on a day where you have absolutely nothing planned because you can wait from 4-6 hours although they tell you 2-4. Also, they can and will disqualify you for issues as small as asthma. So, ASK them first if you have medical issues before waiting so long. I've seen so many angry people scream and run out that door because they were disqualified after HOURS of waiting. ASK FIRST BEFORE WAITING!

Now Complaints...
They do seem understaffed on some days. The line will be going out the door which I really don't mind, it's when I'm finished that it's irritating. There were days where everyone would be finished at different times, and holding their hand up in their air ready leave for 20 minutes+ before staff came around. By then, EVERYONE begins to shout and claim that they were done first and whoever is the loudest or the closest to that staff member wins the game. If they had more staff members on the floor or even a number system instead of the hand raising thing, it would be less hostile and easier for both the donor and staff member.

My other complaint is some of the donors who go there. I've dealt with some short tempered hostile donors who try to fight for their place in line or fight to get unhooked from the IV and leave first, sometimes with me and sometimes with the staff. For the most part people are respectful but some of them are cranky and impatient and treat this place like it's there to only SERVE THEM but there's not really any way to avoid 'em.!</review>< pics>

I love this place. Friendly staff. Very professional. Phlebotomist are very nice. Express service. Bonuses are fair. The building is very clean and sanitized. In my opinion management should be more involved with greeting the donors in the building. Sam dose an amazing job here. She made my stay here warm and plesent. I had had a wonderful time here donating and will be back.</Review>

< Review>
Usually Octapharma is a very nice and professional place to donate, but the  last few days I came in and try to donate and it was a nightmare including today. I waited over two hours lying in a bed waiting to get stick with a needle. I had to be at work at 2 so around 12:45 I look up and seen only two workers on the floor that was actually sticking donors and a long line damn there out the door with donors waiting for a bed.  My advice quit accepting new donors when you got a long line of current donors waiting to donate, and have more employees on hand to handle the volume towards the end of the month.  Thanks</Review>

Very slow service I went in today for regular donation, all was good until the screener put in the wrong information moving to fast, I was then told that I wouldn't be able to to donate and was sent away when it was their error. This place sucks badly should be closed down poor staffing. I recooreco Biomat plasma, Grifols is way better.<//Review>

Came back as a first time patient and I was highly disappointed. I arrived to an empty room...There was no line and it took over 3 hrs just to get a simple vital. 3hrs later I watched the room get packed with ppl and I’m just getting my vitals on the express lane. I’ve been coming here since the mtvernon location and for it to be empty this was the worst experience. Please hire more staff, two hrs later and I had to force myself to stay longer because of my busy schedule and time wasted...get newer younger nurses PLEASE :UPDATE-left at 8:30 WORST THAN GOING TO A HOSPITAL 2-8:30 that’s almost 7hrs. Unexceptable!!!🗣🗣🗣🗣 after hrs of being there I didn’t want to leave n come back to do this process again smh. Throw the whole staff away😩</Review>

They only get one star because you get payed if I could show the bruise on my boyfriends arm you guys would not want to attend here. They’re not only understaff but they have staff that do not know what they are doing. Some can’t find a vein or stick it to deep etc it’s a mess. A mess I went and didn’t go back my boyfriend went back and his arm started to swell he told the lab nurse and they took it out and said they will still pay him I’m annoyed because it’s unprofesssional to not be considerate of people’s lives he said she was rushing to because it was the end of shift please don’t go here and if you do there is a short older lady with short silver hair (caucasians) sort of loud but funny she does a very good job actually has experience.< /text>

very shady business. will waste your time and not pay you a cent. they do not tell you what may disqualify you until the very end...after they screen you for three hrs and collect tons of very personal info. They encouraged me to drive long distance saying all would be fine. total heartless liars. avoid at all cost.</Text>

The process should take no more than hour but takes almost 2 EVERY TIME. Do NOT come here. It's literally a nightmare wait. Yes the staff are friendly but time management is HORRIBLE!!! Octapharma please do not respond with a BS "I'M SORRY WE ARE WORKING HARD TO..." If you were then these complaints would still not be going on.</review>< Pics>

This place is a nightmare. They don't do anything but talk, the place is gross, and they have messed up twice while drawing blood, causing the vein to collapse and severe bruising. After all the pain and soreness they would only put $5 on the card because she couldn't stick the needle in right.<//Review>

While most people experience little to no side effects from donating plasma, you should consult with your personal physician about any concerns. We want your health and safety to come first! Regarding payment, the amount of plasma you can donate is set by the FDA based on your body weight (eg. 110-149 lbs., 150-174 lbs., 175-400 lbs.). Generally, the more you weigh, the more plasma can be collected, and the more time it may take to donate plasma. Your payment reflects this.'}</resp>

<text>Been going here for 5 months, and the very last time I went, I couldn't believe how things ended up. They said I couldn't donate, because of one little scratch, on my arm(they are keeping from trying to reach my promotion which pays me 50 instead of the 25 I make constantly. At this center, they will use any excuse, to not let you donate. So I was out of luck, no bus money or anything. I was charging my phone in the restroom, and I left it their for a minute, and I come back, some guy, stole my phone, that fast. The crazy part about it, is that, the security guard seen him take it(he was using restroom at the same time phone got taken), and he didn't even want to help me point out the guy. To top it off, The nurses, at the front desk, were laughing at me, because It was a government phone, and they assume I can just get another one, Their supposed to be working and enjoying there job helping people and working with people not talking down on someone that's going through a struggle. Yes I am a struggle, and I donate, because I need the money. But my experience at this donation center, was so horrible, I would advise any one, to not go here, and go to GCAM, they have very good reviews. I am defiantly going to transfer my profile, to their center. And please, if the owner tries to respond to my review, I wish he can just shut up, because the nurses and security guards, he hires, have bad characters and are not good people at all.

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have been donating at Octapharma regularly for about 4-6 months now. My time spent there has been a largely enjoyable experience. The staff is friendly and courteous, and this really says something considering how over-worked they are.

They could use more phlebotomists, but the ones there really know their stuff. And if you find a tech that you really like, they actually let you make requests. So if your favorite needle wizard is on duty, don’t be afraid to ask for their services.

Their registration while lengthy is actually streamlined so once you return the process goes much faster. This is of course all required by law and anyone criticizing them for this part of the procedure is simply ignorant of the fact that the staff & management cannot change this. Yes they are going to be collecting some very personal information, and yes some of your answers or a combination of them may disqualify you from donating… Boo hoo.

This is not a retail service; you are not entitled to customer satisfaction. It is the staff’s foremost concern to protect the well being of their clients, and those who may be receiving donated plasma. For that reason they have to calculate the risk or chance that you may have some kind of disqualifying condition. Maybe your blood pressure is too low, too high, or maybe you engaged in & admitted to certain high risk behaviors. Either way, no one should be throwing daggers at an organization for complying with safety laws.

Wait times can be pretty long, but they are honest and forthright about this, telling every new customer that they can expect it to take between 2 and 3 hours. This is again, due to a lack of phlebotomists, and the popularity of this location. They are routinely swamped, with lines of beds full of people waiting their turn to get stuck. This is yet another thing that they as the company cannot control. They cannot wave a magical wand and produce a new tech with the same astounding level of skill I’ve come to expect, nor can they banish the crowds of people that show up every day.

So yes the service, entirely because of circumstance, may be a little slow, but the quality is amazing.

The facilities are, well, unremarkable, but what do you expect, it’s a donation center. But it’s always very clean, and there are televisions positioned all around so you can always see one from any bed.

Their movie selection could use some serious, serious improvement however.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Name>Lori C McGinnis< /Name><Review>Las Vegas Octapharma. Employee yelled out " hey clean up your equipment. There's still blood left here."  Way to freak out your donors. What the hell. I'm a nurse. Do I really want them sticking a needle in my vein? $50.00 not worth getting a serioys infection.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< user>

Horrible.  Rules change daily and half of the employees are lazy. Understaffed and refuse to hire so youre waiting fprever. Employees just enjoy chatting to each other. Machines are in need of cleaning and being fixed. With the exception of 3 employees the rest are rude. Donation prices change monthly and it isnt explained well whatsoever. Basically $25 for the first 5 donations then it can go to 30,35, and maybe 40 if your check in person pays attention.< /review>

Hurry up and wait. They are quick to get you to a seat and get plasma but once process is over (which can take a hour ) they are slow to get you out especially considering you need to use the restroom<//Text>

Its an okay place the only problem is wait times. I have come at all diffrent times of day and the problem is always the same. As the line picks up the staff have no sense off urgency to bring the line back down. then once im in a chair im waiting 30 minutes for my whole setion to fill up before they start sticking people. I only take 35 min to complete donation but with the waiting its takes 2 hours min. to get in and out< /review>

sh*tty customer service sh*tty pay and they like to defer people. they will only allow 2 donations a week so dont try going every other day. they want to pay the least amount for our donations, the whole setup is to get your plasma for as cheap as they can so they can make 99% profit. keep in mind most of the people that work there have not passed there exam yet so expect to bleed out or have a fewadjustments and resticks.< /review>

<Review>I called on the phone and asked if it was ok to bring Amazon envelope to verify my address they said ok, I provided everything required, they checked it, I waited 2 hours for them to bring me in the back room, then another lady checked my envelope again and turn me away because it didn't have the prefix "JR" on my name matching the ID, I think it was very petty they didn't catch this when I first showed up and instead of letting me know right off the bat when I arrived they made me wait for 2 hours for no reason and then insisted on mailing me a postcard, when I told them everything "OK" when I arrived and was not made aware there would be a problem, they went to check with the employee who checked me in and she was conveniently "out to lunch" very disappointed in this place and will be going elsewhere.<//Review>< Pictures>

Today I went to the plasma place and they wouldn't take me cause my shirt allowed a little bit of stomach to show & because " men stare " I had to change and be made feel uncomfortable and sexualized by a WOMAN might I add . Talking about dress code .  I shouldn't have to be made feel uncomfortable for the comfort of MEN who can't control themselves .</text>

<Text>This Starbucks is located in the Lowe's/Costco shopping center on Central/Dexter that includes a drive thru and spacious lobby. I had a great experience at this location. The store is super clean and organized, the staff was working hard on this busy Saturday morning. My drink was as expected.< /Text>< pics>

Starbucks is Starbucks. If your going into a Starbucks, you know they are all the same. A little "stuffy" feel in the air. You know. Not my thing. But I don't judge, and stuffy coffee drinkers are probably, just like you. So you will enjoy it.< /text>

It's like they took a medium and watered it down to make a large. The ingredients are there but not enough to make the entirety. Basically watered down chocolate milk. Also I'm not Tim, so maybe Tim drinks it differently?< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Love my morning people, they are quick and attentive, and super nice...but when I go in the afternoon, the place is trashed.  It’s spotless in the mornings and in the afternoon I leave with sticky shoes and unknown spilled drink droplets all over my cup.  I prefer this location in the morning and avoid in the afternoon.<//Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Gigi is VERY efficient. I placed a mobile order for pick up. No one greeted me when I walked in or asked if I have been helped after being spotted by all 4 employees working behind the counter. I stood for 5 minutes watching ( who had her back turned making drinks) Gigi made 3 Venti Fraps and 4 Venti drinks within minutes. I was amazed. After she was done I asked if she was the manager due to how fast and efficient she was working. I've been to hundreds of Starbucks; having recently moved here from Seattle. Gigi is by far the best barista I've seen. It is too bad the other employees were working like Sloths. Otherwise I would have given a 5 star. I hope this review gets to the store manager and get Gigi promoted. She deserves it.<//Review>

Website said it was opening at 5 AM and then employees got there and changed the time to 7:30 AM. For cleaning; cleaning should be done before or after scheduled businesses hours. Very Disappointing!<//Review>

This is actually the best Starbucks I've been to in a long time! I went through the drive-thru and service was FAST, and the baristas were super friendly. Then, I went inside since my daughter changed her mind about wanting a drink, and it was fast, they were super accommodating to my special drink (I know it's their job) but Jackson was not bothered by us at all, and instead gave us recommendations on other drinks we could try. I didn't know it was a new location until he mentioned they had opened only two days ago when I complimented him on their service. Great, fast, and friendly Starbucks! I wish the one in Lake Elsinore by Stater Bros was this fast and friendly 😔<//review>

Sooo I stopped by a this Starbucks on my way home, to get a caramel Frappuccino which haven’t had in years and it tasted like flavored milk with a hint of color no caramel swirl nor sprinkles on top... it’s Starbucks that broke, that they can’t afford to make the same quality drinks as before Covid??  Sooo dang disappointed and to top it off I was charged the same amount and no discounts! Really??< /text>

Mildred Carranza was very helpful. We had a lot of questions concerning self-employment and she she provided excellent information. She gave us tips about how to keep our paperwork in order. While our appointment did take long, it was full of information.</Review>

Don't Use Dutton Plumbing! We had a terrible experience with Dutton Plumbing! Out of urgency, took advantage of their well-advertised $73 drain cleaning. They were very professional, COVID protocols in place and timely. However, diagnosed a major problem, which would immediately cost over $900 as a short-term fix, then diagnosed a clean out drain pipe replacement issue, which would have cost us $10,000-$20,000+!! When I pushed back on the $900, technician said he could talk to his supervisor and probably reduce the cost to $600ish. Nope! I asked them to send me the bid in writing and I was going to get a second opinion. Never received the bid, no follow up phone call, nothing. Called another plumber, referred by a friend and guess what...our pipes are fine, there are no immediate issues and the clean out pipe DOES NOT need replacing! In talking to friends, they've had similar experiences with Dutton. Disappointing, to say the least! How many people have they taken advantage of?? I responded to their survey about the service and no response.< /text>

<text>I was charged $395 to repair a pipe in the backyard that had broke at the connection point to another pipe. They were here for about an hour. The plumber was professional and very nice. Company provided photo of whom I should expect. Overall great customer service but severely overpriced, especially since only the connector pipe was replaced and originally pipe was reattached. The price would prevent me from using services in the future. I had to have the main water turned off due to pipe break at the section, so shopping for a better price was limited due to time constraint.< /text>< user_name>

We have been part of the Dutton plumbing "family" since 2008; obviously, we are happy with them!  Yesterday, was the BEST experience ever.  For our yearly maintenance, they sent Technician Roth Foster.  Roth was not only professional and thorough, but took the time to explain problems that he saw.  To make it easier, Roth took photos of the problems to help us understand what needed to be done.  I want Roth to be "our technician" always!<//Review>

I found a leak in my garage pipe and needed to fix as soon as possible.  I found Dutton Plumbing on the internet.  They were quick to respond and were very pleasant on the phone and the tech was very pleasant as well.  I received a quote to fix the leak of $540.  Since I needed it fixed I didn't question it. After speaking with my husband it just didn't sound right. They replaced 8 inches of copper pipe 1 joint 1 elbow and sweat 4 connections. It took 45 minutes start to finish. Then the tech talked me into a $79 dollar yearly family plan that really only gives me 10% off future purchases. I called the operator and questioned the $79 dollar charge and was told that my repair would have been higher if I did not purchase the plan?????  At this point I was so frustrated I just let it go but I really do feel I was taken advantage of because of the timing (2 days before xmas) and I really did not have a chance to price shop. I will chalk this one up to my mistake and hope this review will make others think twice.<//text>

John Medina, Larry and Jonathon did a great job rerouting the hot and cold water piping to the house.  The crew was polite and presented great communication skills keeping me informed of what they had planned to do with the route taken and why.
Thank you to William and Randy also of the management team!

Called Dutton for service on a faulty water heater. They told me that someone would be out that day.  Waited all day. 3 phone calls from them stating that they would have someone out soon. 3 full days of waiting at home. 15 waste of time phone calls from them. Finally just told them to forget it. Who has time to sit around and wait for someone to show up?  Worst experience ever for a service company.  What a joke. Unless you have a week to wait. Don't bother!</text>

<Review>The plumbers that came to my house (Shannon and Joel) were seriously amazing.  We have used many different plumber companies in the past and never received service like this before.  We will only use Dutton moving forward.  Not only were they knowledgable and able to fix multiple issues (other plumbers could not), they were also very friendly, took their time to explain things and made sure there were no other issues.  They were life savers and fixed an issue I have had for 3 months that no other plumber could.  Highly recommend them!!!</Review><time>1614890607586<//time>< UserId.>

<review>In October of 2020 we had to have some plumbing under the kitchen sink replaced. It worked fine for about 6 months until an entire pipe became detached and flooded under the sink. We called that night and were told that we would be helped the next day. It has been two days and we’ve been rescheduled twice. This is unacceptable. Not only is our kitchen sink inoperable right now, but I’ve had to call out of work for 2 days and now a third just to wait around for nothing to happen. I’m disappointed. The sink pipe replacement shouldn’t have failed so quickly, and I should not have to call out of work just to be told “we’ll get there tomorrow for sure”. We will be using another pluming service after this repair.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Extend dryer gas pipe 8 feet along outside of a wall. Replace hot and cold water valves. 5 hrs. total. I was quoted $1340.00. No way. So then lowered price to $890.00. No price base to estimate was used. Seamingly arbitrary to see what could be gotten but was just beyond reason. I had to relent to $890 because calling someone else and taking another day off without pay would add up to that. But I had then gotten an over-the-phone quote for $70/hr + parts. Got me!  $30 parts. Over $150/hr. Beware!!!  No show first scheduled day and took day off work. Estimate to replace plumbing in the bathroom remodel - $9000. More than the entire remodel quote from a GC. Same job quoted for $2600 by another county plumbing co. Something wrong here folks.  It was beyond belief. Then I see these reviews of the same rip off.  No ethics. Obviously the BBB should know.  Or they can refund me to reasonable peer competitive rate. Beware!< /Review><Name>David Coyle<//Name><response>None</response>< pictures>

Two men came from Dutton. They were very nice and professional. They charged $39 to come out. I dealt with several other plumbing companies, which came for free. There initial quote was more than 2X the other companies. When I would not accept their quote they lowered it but still several hundred dollars above any of the other plumbers. I had the work done by another plumber, but wasted my $39.< /review>

Technicians, Richard and Felipe, did a fantastic job finding the cause of a leak and helped to mitigate it before any major damage could occur. They were very professional, kind, and upfront with their service. Dutton has been this home's plumber for more than 10 years and I highly recommend their services.<//review>

Thought it was going to be easy - old range out, new range in. WRONG. the configuration and recessed space for the gas line on the new range did not align with the old one. So, my new range wouldn't just slide in to the wall but leave a 3"gap behind the range - not acceptable. The solution - having to move a gas line. I am a DIY guy but prefer not to blow myself or my family up when dealing with gas, so had to call the professionals.

Called Dutton at 1:51 pm on a Monday and they had Steve, their gas specialist, out at my house before 4:00 pm. He and his apprentice looked at, accessed and gave me options for my repair/fix. It was ultimately going to take more time than completing it the same day. So, we were Steve's first appointment the following day. He was prompt, polite and professional. His work was clean and thorough. He made sure that everything worked as it should before he left. Totally impressed with Steve and the Dutton Team. Price was fair and appreciated Steve's attention to detail.

I hope that I never have to move a gas line again, but if I do, I'm calling Dutton.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZa5k18aHIpqtBkZzn-Mkw14lY_7uqoxVGGjoj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

My mother had a little leak under her sink. Dutton Plmbg showed up and said the pipe was old, and she needed a $20,000 repipe. She called me, and told her to tell them no. They called back and said they could do it for $13,222. She said no. They called again and said $11,500. She found a handy man, who fixed it for $750.00, and gave her a lifetime grantee even if she sells her place.She didn’t need a repipe. It’s really sad how these big company’s take advantage. How do they live with themselves?  It’s disgusting.</Text>

<text>Without a doubt the most knowledgeable plumbers out there.  That said, their "pricing" is wonky.  I've been using them for 15 years at two different houses.  It's always a haggle.  The on scene guy gives you a price range, but the manager by phone makes the final adjustments when you start breaking down the per item/service price.  Once you get past all that though, you'd be hard pressed to find a better crew with more resources available to you...one job I had 3 van loads of guys at my house.  So you DO get what you pay for.  It's a love/hate relationship.  I wouldn't want anyone else working on my house....but it's always a bit of a tussle at the beginning.  If you're comfortable asking questions and putting in some work, these guys won't disappoint.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<time>1615751960140<//time><rating>1</rating><Text>COMPLETE LIARS! BEWARE!  I called  them out to light pilot on water heater - the serviceman looked at it for about two minutes and immediately said I needed a new water heater. We asked if there was anything else that could be done - he said maybe - he would have to call the office. We had him leave as he couldn't or wouldn't help. We had another plumber (Highsmith & Daughters) out an hour later who relit the pilot for us and cleaned the fire screen . He was done in about 20 min.. This is how Dutton operates - they will either upsell or lit to you to get you to spend hundreds or thousands on things you do not need. I have reported them to the BBB as well.< /Text>< Pics>

Our kitchen sink was clogged and we needed service. The men from Dutton did a good job and all is well again. Felix and his apprentice (so sorry I forgot his name) were both personable and extremely courteous. Both men seemed genuinely interested in giving us the best service possible.

<Text>About a year ago, a valve connector under my kitchen sink broke while I was trying to install something and had to turn the water off to the house. Couldn’t repair it myself...called a few plumbers, Dutton was the fastest to get someone out. He came, looked at everything(he was very nice), quoted me $800. Now, I honestly had no idea what the issue was, but I definitely wanted to get a few more quotes. Second plumbing company came, charged me $175. No thanks Dutton.</Text>< user>

Hooking up with them is not an inexpensive venture, but we knew we were in the best hands.  SO worth it when it comes to our home's plumbing.  No more headaches!!

I've used Dutton twice now and each experience was exemplary of what customer service can and should be.  The issues were very far apart in terms of severity.  The first issue was just inspecting and replacing a kitchen faucet. The second was replacing a water heater.

Both times the technician was prompt, courteous, patient, and explained the issue in great detail.  They were upfront and honest about their prices and offered me a multitude of options to fit my budget and fix the issue the same day.  I did not feel pressured or pushed and I felt they went above and beyond to find solutions that would not require me to shell out astronomical costs.

In particular, I'd like to compliment Cole and Sean who I dealt with on the water heater issue.  Without their help and guidance, I could have had a much larger problem on my hands in the immediate and in the future. They even provided me with a solution that will make the lifespan of my new water heater last much longer.< /text>

< Review>
I understood that my appt would between 9-11am on Tuesday.  When their dispatcher called, she said the tech was on another job and would not be available until the afternoon. She would call around 1:00.  When she did call, she said the tech was hung up on the morning job and I would be his first appt the following morning; to expect a call at 8:00am.  No call.  I called at 8:35 and she said the tech was on an emergency related to the previous day's job, and she would get hold of his manager.  I told her to tell the manager that I was very displeased with their service.  The manager called at 9:00 and said someone was not reading his schedule right and the tech would be at my house in 15 minutes.  He was, but he said he had no knowledge of my appt the day before.  I told him we contacted another plumbing company, and they were coming out at 1:00.  So he left without doing the work.  Dutton is expensive and unreliable.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.</Review>

<text>Dutton Plumbing, Inc: We had an emergency service call late in the day, Dutton Plumbing was the only company that was able to confirm they would have someone available and provided me with ETA. Jay our plumber was great, he worked hard to determine the problem. He was unable to complete the repair that night however he rescheduled us as his first appointment the next day showed on time and completed the work. Jay had a great positive attitude was truly knowledgeable.<//text><Name>Ale Valle< /Name></record>

Needed a new garbage disposal. Was never quoted cost over phone.
Tec arrives and quotes me $800.00 for disposal and instillation.
Outrageous.  As him to leave. They did waive the service fee.</review>

<review>Cole was the service estimator sent to my home.  He was  a very professional and honest  employee, providing a very detailed description of all of the details of my repair request.

Could not get any more incompetent than Dutton Plumbing. Don’t use them!  If you do, you’ll be sorry. Called on Thursday, they stood me up for Friday appointment. Then stood me up for Saturday. Had the audacity to ask if they could come on Monday. Wow! The worst of the worst! 0 stars if possible as they couldn’t even earn one star.</Text>

I had a simple leaking faucet like most people do so I called Dutton Plumbing in Santa Clarita. When the service tech arrived, I explained the problem and symptoms of the leak and showed him that when I applied light downward pressure to the hot water handle, the drip would stop. This guy, without ever looking under the sink or taking the water handle off to inspect the fixture told me that my entire faucet fixture would have to be rebuilt and replace the shut off valves under the sink or only replace the valves. Without inspecting the valves or the faucet itself, he gave a quote for $515 for replacing the valves and $795 for rebuilding the faucet and replacing the valves, both of which I declined as the cost seemed unusually high.

I emailed the company that manufactured the faucet and provided the exact same description of the problem via email that I gave Dutton Plumbing’s service tech in person. The faucet manufacturer replied back suggesting that I replace the seats and springs under the faucet handle and provided me with the part number. I purchased a two pack of the part for $4.98 and a tube of silicone grease for $4.00 at Home Depot and installed them myself in 10 minutes, resulting in the leak being fixed.

Dutton Plumbing not only misdiagnosed how to fix the leak, they suggested work that did not EVEN need to be done at the cost of nearly $800. They do this stuff for a living, so how could they not EVEN suggest replacing the seats and springs? But instead, he told me that I need to replace my entire faucet fixture and valve handles. I don't like being cheated and that is exactly what this place tried to do to me.

DO NOT let them do any work until you get a second opinion and estimate. They wanted to charge me $800 for work that did not need to be done AT ALL and I ended up fixing the leak myself and it literally cost me LESS THAN the price of a movie ticket. Read the Yelp reviews and you'll see a pattern of them trying to overcharge people.

I spoke to someone at the Dutton after they saw my review and he tried to make up an excuse, saying that they might suggest repairs that are "more comprehensive." There's a big difference between "more comprehensive" and repairs that are not required AT ALL. Crooks!</Review>

Dutton assisted in discovering some faulty sewer pipes under our slab  in December - they identified the problem and corrected with a combination of new pipe and a new lining for existing pipes - we recently had an inspection this August and discovered a new problem in one of the pipes that we all thought was corrected. Dutton stepped up and under the supervision of Randy dispatched crews to correct the problem in a very timely manner - all I can say is that it is really nice to find a contractor that not only say they stand behind their work and but like Dutton actually do - thanks to the entire Dutton team for a job well done and a special thanks to Randy for having our back.  We would recommend using Dutton for any of your plumbing requirements.</Review>

This time around the customer service was closer to average compared to the last time as more follow up with them needed to be done. Job took a few days; tech was on time first day. Pricey, but we trust it. Not all issues were resolved as a result of repairs like we thought but all and all a good job was done by Jimmy. Both Randy and Jimmy are easy to work with.<//Review>

<text>I called about a toilet clog & kitchen faucet installation service Dec. 7 in AM, and was told a technician would come the same day. No show Dec. 7, but told a technician would come the next day Dec. 8. No show again and told a technician would come Dec. 10 at some time to be determined. A plumber did arrive in the early afternoon. The estimate to install a kitchen faucet was an exorbitant amount of $430. I declined work due to excessive price and the unreasonable delay in getting a technician out.</text>< Name>

Confusion on the time they would show up.  When they tell you sending it over to dispatch at 9:30 doesn’t mean they are coming to your house at 9:30.  Clarify when your on the phone your appt time.  I took the day off waiting and they didn’t come until the next day.  Once they arrived they did a great job kind polite and follow up call right after.  I will use them again.< /review>

Still have smell from sink and shower.. The  2nd tech that came right away knew what where the smell in the kitchen sink was coming from. Replaced a hose and the smell went away. They had to come out a total of 4 times for an issue that could have been fixed on the 1st call had they listened to our request. Spent more time on the phone with the them then it took to fix the problem. Poor communication between techs and dispatchers.  Had to get the managers involved. Not an over all good experience with this company.< /Review>< Time>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>We have used Dutton Plumbing for years and have been happy with them until this last guy!  We got a call about a free annual inspection of our water heater and toilets so we had the guy come out to take a look.  At first, he was nice and greeted me outside.
I showed him the water heater, which was in good shape, or so he said.

His disposition seemed to change once he got into the house.  He seemed to be judging us and our house because we are poor and on a fixed income and can not afford nice things. I saw the guy looking around and making faces at our stuff.  I didn't say anything because I thought it was going to end there and I was used to people judging our stuff, which isn't a big deal.

We had 2 of our 3 dogs in a training crate so they wouldn't jump on the guy and knock him down.  He used the word "cage" when he saw them and we corrected him.  I could tell he was judging us, even after we had already explained it to him we did not want them knocking him down and that we had just put them in the crate once we heard the knock on the door.  They are spoiled and well fed, so I had hoped he would have seen that and let it go at that.  He proceded to make rude comments and noises about our house and asked if something on the back of our sons' toilet was pee.  I said I did not know (because it was the toilet our autistic son uses and he sometimes might miss) and hoped he saw embarrassment and humiliation on my face from his comment.  By this point I thought he was just being rude and hostile.  I guess he didn't see the look on my face because he kept going.
The dogs were still barking from a stranger being in the house.  I just walked away from him, told him I was putting and put all the dogs outside so I could hear what he had to say.  I figured he was having a bad day, so I tried to let it go.  I just wanted this over at this point so he could leave.  He quoted us some astronomical price for fixing a running toilet in our bathroom, I thanked him and thought that was the end, but it wasn't.  I figured he just made up the high price because he didnt want to do the work, which was fine by me because I wanted him gone by that time.  I never made faces or said anything to him because I thought he was taking his bad day out on us, but I really felt humiliated and embarrassed.  I was so ready to let it go and move on with my life

It didnt end there though:  About an hour later, we get a knock on the door from Animal Control about how our dogs were in a "cage" all day long, which is not true, and that the lady had to see them and take a picture of them and write up a report!  We have never been so embarrassed and humiliated in all our lives.
We are NEVER using Dutton Plumbing again!  I AM LIVID THAT HE EMBARRASSED US LIKE THAT!  HE WAS UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!  I was trying to let it go, but now I can't.

Never hire this company!  Never!  I could understand if our dogs were emaciated or mangy looking, which they weren't so I dont know why the guy called Animal Control on us!   Our dogs are well taken care of!  Smh!  I  Now, I wish I had said something and kicked him out for being so rude!  Now, there's a report about our dogs on file with Animal Control!  Thanks Dutton Plumbing! I don't know why they hire plumbers like that because he's not people friendly!  I'm calling Corporate on Monday.  I dont care if it is close to Christmas.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Dutton showed up at the top of my Google search and I decided to give them a try.  They were simply outstanding from the start and were constantly in touch with updates.   Their rep showed up that day and immediately diagnosed the problem, quoted prices for several options and, when the replacement part was from an old outdated fixture, drove 20 miles to find it and came back the next morning to finish the job.  He was courteous, professional and extremely polite.  The price was very competitive.  I would add that the last time I had need of a plumber, I called the so-called "smell good" guys and I felt ripped off.  The $99 drain clog turned into a $1,000 replacement project.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing.< /Review>

We had a major pipe break and Dutton showed showed up within a few hours. Jay was wonderful and tried his best to snake it, but our pipes are 60+ years old and it was time for the big fix. They made things as comfortable as they could over the next few days as they replaced our pipe, while doing so they found a gas leak and they just took care of everything, calling the gas company and staying through it all.  All of the people were so friendly and competent. We appreciated it all<//text>

Called Dutton Plumbing the Plumber for leaking pipe under the slab, excellent response time professional appearance needed it fixed or replaced, new pipe. Price quote was fixed too high Dutton Plumbing quoted over four thousand dollars to repair with new by pass pipe. Asked around town found a long time plumber of Simi Valley to do same repair for under one thousand dollars.< /text>

$20K+ estimate job cost to $1,250.
We were referred to Dutton Plumbing by our home warranty to fix our gas leak issue on our property. They came in the next day of our supposed schedule. We paid them $3,110 for them to detect the leak and fix it, after that they weren't able to fix it and told us we need to have a gas line repiping so they gave us an additional quote costing  $20k and may go higher if they need to open the drywalls, we were shocked and asked our friends from construction. We showed them the receipt and the quote and they told us we are getting scammed, they were so heartbroken that people like these exist, we found out stuff like 3pcs shut-off valves we paid for $1,200+ which only costs $25 each etc.. They did their best to find us trustworthy plumbing and referred us to Gordon Taylor Plumbing and long story short, they fixed the whole thing for ONLY $1,250.

Lessons learned... DON'T GET SCAMMED BY THESE SWINDLERS.< /Text>

They scheduled me same day service, and Jay was prompt and professional. I was sent a photo of him prior to his arrival, so even though I was home alone with my two children, I felt safe opening the door to him. He completed the job in a timely fashion, even with my four year old shadowing him. He was patient and friendly with my son, which I appreciated very much. Our drains were all serviced well.<//text>

Made appointment this morning November the 27th and no one has showed up received Text all day saying they would show up and then they pushed us all the way back to Monday.  Who wants to go a full 5 days with their sink clogged up not being able to cook in their kitchen? Not I.. Moving on to another company! 👎< /review>

But he didnt leave without advice and awareness of the pipes we have, and what we should do in the near future. He kept his word, and the sevice was no charge since the clog was not removed.

Eric N. was an absolute professional and extremely knowledgeable.  He not only resolved the issue we called for within a couple minutes of arrival, but also assisted and resolved several other minor issues that had been pestering us for quite some time.  Eric is by far the best we’ve seen and would happily go back to this company just for his services.  Really outstanding!</Text>

Friday Dutton Plumbing came to clear residential sanitary sewer line for $73.  Once technician arrived the cost went to $297 to remove toilet & snake & run camera through line. Dutton cleared blockage than called to tell me no guarantee toilet will not backup because existing line is corroded & to replace would cost $10K to $11K. Saturday night 8PM & again @ 2AM animals heard fighting under house. Found screens to crawl space under house not reinstalled. We were not expecting & are disappointed with this service call from Dutton.< /text>

Great customer service from Dutton Plumbing! I used the chat option at 5:30 am when our shower backed up. The person was very helpful, letting me know I could expect a call from the office first thing. The office called promptly after opening letting me know we were going to get on the schedule for that day and they would call back with updates throughout the morning. I really appreciated that kind of service!
When the crew arrived they were polite, communicated well, and were efficent at their job. They were mindful of keeping the house clean as they came and went.
They provided great service at very reasonable price. I cannot say enough about how impressed and pleased we were with the whole experience. Thanks Dutton!!</Text>

But Dutton takes care of all of that you’ll find it it’s actually not the price it’s the value that you get that makes the money were spending not only are they friendly they’re actually on time… In LA that’s something that literally never happens even if you have a genie in a jar.

COLE showed up exactly on time he was able to diagnose your problem we live in an old house and it takes a lot of work within five minutes he was able to show us everything working through the work that was done and start right away

It didn’t even take him 25 minutes because he had the right tools the right experience it’s probably one of the friendliest plumbers I met seriously don’t worry about price that’s for shoppers value that’s for True customers and that’s what you when you get from Dutton desire  to be a good customer value is worth it.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1584458237673, 'text': 'Chris, Thank you so much for your review.

Dutton Plumbing was great to work with, they continuously kept in contact with us on when a technician would be available. Mark M. came to the rescue! He was so friendly and great to work with. When our sink wouldn't drain the first time he went above and beyond to get it unclogged. Couldn't have asked for a better experience and will definitely be asking for Mark M. again for any future plumbing needs.<//text>

< review>
Jake was very professional and did a great job replacing the faucet and explaining the process as well as answering all questions clearly. The company was also really good with following up and scheduling and made it really easy to narrow down a time that worked for me rather than blocking off half a day and me wondering when they'd arrive.<//review>

Jake was amazing.  He was extremely prompt, said he'd be here at 3 and knocked on my door at 3.  He was very patient with me and my questions.  The service was excellent.  I will highly recommend Jake to anyone.</Review>

5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ My first experience with Dutton I was a little nervous getting a plumber in a new city. We just bought our home a few months ago. My sister had used this company and spoke highly of them. I called this morning, they let me know they would be there at a time within an hour window. They texted, emailed and called to confirm with a picture of our Service person. His name is Mark M. He was very professional, clean, and respectful. He listened to my concerns, told me what he thought was going on. Let me know what he was going to do and finished in a timely manner as well. I could not believe how clean he was with the service. He brought a rug, covered his shoes and actually cleaned around my toilet when he was finished. I give the company an A + and Mark gets and A+ too! I am so happy and we now have a new plumber. We can actually ask for the same person again too. The price was great too! Thank you Mark M. And Dutton Plumbing!<//text>

Outrageous quotes! Having friendly, punctual plumbers does not excuse price gouging. You should be embarrassed to claim being a company people can trust to send to their mothers!!!!!!
As a large company with so many clients and service calls, you are able to charge LESS than the other local one-man show plumbing services, but instead you instruct your plumbers to take advantage of people.
Such a ridiculous difference, trying to charge me $2400 for the same job another plumber was able to do for $600... Shame on you for taking advantage of a law enforcement family. I’d bet had my husband been home to deal with your plumbers, the quote would have been much less...  SMH.
ZERO STARS and I’ll be sharing this review on any social media and review sites available. What goes around comes around apparently 😉 Cheers!</text>

<Text>This company has just charged my 82 year old mother in law $5100 to replace some leaking pipes and shower mixer in her bathroom. It took just 1 day to complete the work. Included in the price was a charge for over $600 just to test that the work they carried out didn't leak. I am working in London so I spoke to Robert on the phone about the job, he tried to tell me that a length of copper pipe cost $50 when it cost less than $10.

They have quoted $28,000 to replace the rest of the pipework. I have been in the construction industry for over 30 years and have NEVER heard of such prices. They’re not even repairing the drywall that they cut away in the price as the home insurance company are doing that.< /Text>< date>

<user_name>Richard Goldner</user_name><Review>The technician assigned to my service call (Eric N.) was, in a word “... OUTSTANDING. He  was complete in everything he did, was personable, most professional, and made certain of quality work in every detail of the step-by-step process in replacing 2-faucets. Having had 4-years experience as a plumber’s helper, I fully understood the difficulties involved in this bathroom upgrade. Throughout the work effort, Eric was congenial and thorough. I look forward to again working with him on other upcoming home improvement projects. Dutton has been our preferred plumbing company for years and that TRUSTED choice has been re-enforced by this recent experience.<//Review>< Rate>

<Review>By doing some work at the house my water pipe started leaking in my garage.
Called Dutton very early in the morning and was greed by a very nice female (sorry missed her name). After explaining  the situation and scheduling  an approximate time for the technician  to arrive they guy appear about right on time.

I knew who I was expecting  because they even send you a picture of the person who will do the job.

Long story short, Eric  was amazing, he not only explained all (I have some skills so I know he was not bluffing) and did the job how I wanted. He even made some recommendations  (not trying to sell because I know that what he was saying I had it in written by the inspector) so good for him in terms of knowledge.

I believe that price is a bit on the high end compared to others, but you cannot put a price on things that you cannot ddo on your ownri and you have no good references
on other people.

My problem was fixed, my wife is happy and I can recommend  Dutton plumbing eyes closed.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1590596087791, 'text': 'Tony, Thank you so much for your review.

Nice people on the phone, but they kept rescheduling me to the next day. I re-arranged my schedule each day just to be told that they couldn't get to me that day and couldn't guarantee me a time the following day either. They had such good reviews and one of their sayings says, "we can be there in 60 minutes", that is not the case unfortunately.<//review>

Adam was very professional and explained everything in detail what type of work was to be performed. Work was completed in a reasonable time frame and he even cleaned up my shelf under the kitchen sink. Thanks Adam!

Originally there were some issues with getting scheduled and having someone come out. However, once we did have somebody come out they did a great job. Will definitely use them again.<//review>

What a great company.  John was professional, friendly and very efficient explaining what repair options we had to fix our water heater.  We usually use our local plumbers which were not available today.  Called Dutton and within hours John was hard at work.  Love their commercials on KHAY.  Will certainly call them in the future</text>

I was looking to have a shower toilet and sink Installed

First they try to lock you in with a 39 dollar deposit and says it will go to the bill
Nope I didn’t pay it
The guy came over and gave me a price of 16,000

For a brass valve they wanted to charge me 500 dollars

And the same valve was at Home Depot for 10 dollars

Can you believe that !

Please don’t hire these guys unless you like wasting money 💰< /Text></record>

Had a great experience with Randy from Dutton Plumbing today. He arrived right when they said he would, and looked clean and professional. (as they advertise). This is the only plumber I've ever had that took the time to stop at the door and put booties over his shoes, and went above and beyond explaining things and even giving me tips on how I could clean and maintain a leaky shower valve to prevent it from having issues in the future. Normally I dread calling for a plumber, but I would not hesitate to call Dutton again in the future for our plumbing needs.<//text>

<review>The team of Ken G., Caleb H., and Juan Carlos R. were very helpful, professional, and friendly. We were kept informed on the progress each day while each of the workmen were very polite to my wife and I when we asked questions.
In addition, Caleb Hernandez and Martin Hernandez, who worked on the plumbing of the drain line, the concrete patch,  and the restoration of the brickwork on the driveway planter displayed master workmanship and professionalism.
Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the lead technician,  was a re-assuring presence each time he visited the work site. He made sure we were getting the service we were paying for and were satisfied with the results.

Special thanks to Bernardo, Guillermo, and Jonathan for their work as the installation crew.
We are very happy with the results of the work of ALL the members of Dutton Plumbing.<//review>< pictures>

I was charged $7,007 for a water heater that you can buy over the internet for under a $1,000. I’m still shocked over the sticker price. They were nice and did a good job installing it, but others would have charged under $3,500 for the same service and unit.< /Review>

I made an appointment on a Thursday for them to come out on a Saturday when I would be off from work to do a non-urgent repair to a kitchen sink. First they called and said they would be late, then called back at the 11th hour to say that they were too busy and wouldn't be able to be there until Monday or Tuesday the following week.  AAA Plumbing came out in 45 minutes and started work immediately.< /Text>

<text>This is a professional business providing quality product and service.  Cole, our installer, was exceptional:  knowledgable, great communicator, thorough, friendly with a wonderful sense of humor.  We highly recommend Dutton Plumbing.  In their case, you DO get what you pay for.  We interviewed several water service businesses and Dutton is the only one offering whole house softening/filtering.  The other services didn't know or didn't want to address this.  NO salt, which can eventually damage pipes.  Preserves appliances and stops mineral buildup.  Water tastes great and our little dogs can drink from the hose--and it's much better fot the plants.<//text></record></dataset><record>

First I want to thank  the Dutton hiring people for their selection in hiring professional and highly qualified personnel as field service representatives for Dutton Plumbing.. These two gentlemen, Richard M and William G. were at my home on 3/14/2019 to review and fix my plumbing issues. I took them through my home and gave them a review of the issues that I had concerns over and they also looked at my Hot water heater. They found issues with the Hot water Heater which I didn't know about.  They took care of all of my issues and performed their work in a professional manner. A real pleasure in doing business with people like this.< /text>

I can’t say enough about how great Dutton Plumbing is and there team especially during this time with the Covid-19. My plumber showed up wearing a mask, gloves and booties without me even having to ask. Lauro & Steve  were very pleasant and knowledgeable. This was a great experience from the beginning to end. Lauro was able to fix my problem quickly with my washer machine valves leaking behind the walls.  5 stars all the way!</review>

Quick and very clean. Also sought out least expensive way to resolve a problem. I haven’t had many plumbing problems, mostly just hired to change out fixtures. So I have little to compare to as far as costs are concerned. But he was clearly more knowledgeable than a well known plumbing company I used on my house in Pacific Palisades. Price was in high end of my ballpark estimate, but I always seem to underestimate costs. And based on man hours they were far less expensive work I had done for replacing a sewer pipe 2 years ago. Also, all options were explained in advance as well as pricing.  I would recommend Ryan K, the service advisor, without reservation.</Text>

Well yesterday after I left work I get a call from my employees that the men’s toilet is overflowing and leaking water all over the floor.
So we called Dutton Plumbing in the morning and they had there plumber come out at 2:00 pm to fix.
He has to remove the toilet to drain because it wasn’t going down with the regular equipment auger tool. He had to get the big guns out and finally cleared the drain and put everything back to normal.
Thank You Eric Dutton and Thanks to your awesome staff of people at Dutton Plumbing !

Oh yeah it was only 73.00 to clear the drain wow what a deal I owe you guys pizza for sure !< /Review>

Secondly, the technician, David W. was great. He detailed what needed to be done, offered advice and finally offered alternatives to the water heater.  He was a professional. Its fantastic to deal with such a customer focused company. I would not hesitate to recommend Dutton Plumbing.
I've already posted this upper part, but now that the work is done, I can't praise this company and David W. enough. David has a superior work ethic, is easy to talk to, very nice and kept me up to date on the progress. He kept the area clean and was nice enough to wait for me to do some work, so that he could continue, which is a rarity these days. If I could give the company 6 stars, I would.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

I am very impressed with the professionalism and quality of work in my  recent experience with Dutton Plumbing. I had a broken water pipe inside the wall between the hall bath and one of the back bedrooms. I called and had a plumber out to my location within hours.  They sent a photo of the workman, a clean cut, respectful young man who wore booties over his shoes inside the house, covered the rug and cleaned up ... complete with an industrial vacuum when he was finished. I was provided with a 4 page document that included a detailed account of the work.  I couldn't be more satisfied.<//review>

Had a great experience with Dutton Plumbing.  Our technician Brandon helped get our water heater back up and running on a Saturday afternoon. It looked like we might need a new water heater but he diligently worked to troubleshoot and fix the non-standard problem with our heater.  Our heater is back up and running thanks to his diligence!   Great service at a very reasonable price!<//text>

Brandon put in a new water heater for us. Throughout the entire process he was pleasant, informative and professional. He explained options, prices and answered all questions we put to him. He completed a relatively lengthy task in one afternoon.  Our home is on a hill and the water heater space is tucked into a small room in the middle of a rambling home layout. His work was flawless. He kept the work area clean and picked up/swept the area after he was done. Easily a 5 star rating. Great job.</text>

Randy was by far the most professional, honest and knowledgeable technician that I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. He came by on a Sunday diagnosed the problem and got to work. He resolved the problem, efficiently and in a timely manner. He didn't try and sell anything that wasn't needed, which seems to be something you run into with plumbers.  Thanks again for your help, keep up the good work.</review>

Great communication with Dutton Plumbing.  I had a tech here in about an hour. The ladies at the office kept me informed on scheduling. Their tech Jaiyro was right on time, did a professional job and even educated me on some plumbing concerns. There pricing is upfront and I did not get the up sell treatment.
I have in the past used  another plumbing company here in Simi . I had a very bad experience with them and will now use only Dutton.
I would definitely recommend Dutton to anyone.<//review>

Our plumber was Eric and he was above and beyond for kindness and knowledge. We bought the membership for a year because we knew we liked them enough (and it's our first year in this house so we're expecting issues to come up). Overall a really great company.<//text>< rating>

Rick came out to do a home inspection. He was very professional, knowledgeable and very thorough. He not only listed each item that
required attention but also showed us its location. He was careful to
make sure he didn't left any messes. I especially liked that he prioritized
needed repairs and gave us options on prices to help us with budgeting for the repairs.<//text>

Contacted Dutton Plumbing today to inquire about Tank less Water Heaters. I certainly got lucky when this Marvelously Sweet person named KAYLA answered the phone asked me if I would like a technician to come out TODAY for estimation and explanation, of course I did.

Well let me say straightaway that I was floored by RANDY ARNOLD, his pleasantly enthusiastic demeanor was well just Awesome. Not at all the crusty plumber who was wishing the day was over and had to be at my house. no not at all, RANDY ARNOLD spent an extensive period of time explaining the technology behind the unit as well as the actual labor and materials that would be required (may I add using terms that made me feel comfortable about the procedure). RANDY ARNOLD asked me often if I was understanding it and if I was still feeling comfortable about making the change. Wow if only the guy at the dealership was that enthusiastically compassionate about selling me a car.

RANDY ARNOLD also mentioned the Family Service Plan for a Lifetime which I jumped all over with great joy. He completely described ALL of the facets and services that accompany the plan. Sold, Sold, Sold.
What a great idea a preventive maintenance plan for my home plumbing needs.

All in All, Yes we have decided to purchase the unit from Dutton Plumbing as well as the Family Service Plan. We are looking at installation as soon as next week, of course RANDY ARNOLD will be our technician with Dutton for as long as he is associated and look forward to his Smiling Face in our Place.

Thank You very much for Your time today Randy, it was a real pleasure meeting you.

Thank You very much Dutton for having RANDY ARNOLD on your staff and allowing us to benefit from his expertise and just plain niceness.

They arrived even before the stated time, were polite and professional, and really took the time to explain what had been a frustrating (and water-logged) situation.  They went the extra mile in checking the drainage of my dishwasher and cleared a blockage.  I highly recommend these gentlemen and Dutton Plumbing!</text>< Pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>Adam Alvarez provided exceptional service! He is friendly, easy to talk to, very knowledgeable and is concerned about the customer’s problem along with a determination to fix whatever is wrong. Adam worked hard and kept in touch the whole time. He conducted himself in a professional manner and answered all my questions by explaining what I wanted to know. Furthermore, I feel that Adam is a very good PR person for Dutton Plumbing and definitely an asset to the company.

Other Dutton field technicians who helped do the repiping job: Miguel V., Ricardo and Edgar. Miguel, who was managing the job itself, kept me well informed about their progress and did a great job. I didn’t have occasion to get to know Ricardo or Edgar very well, but they worked very hard and displayed integrity in what they were doing. I really appreciated their efforts because the quick results speak for themselves.

Overall, I am pleased with the rapidity of the job and the results. I now have peace of mind that I won’t continue to be plagued with recurring drain blockages as I have in the past. I would recommend Dutton Plumbing without reservation to anyone needing a reliable high quality company to get their plumbing or rooter needs taken care of. Thanks for a job well done Dutton!< /Review><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmapID><UserId.>103426501984327279962<//UserId.></record>

<Text>I had a huge drain pipe issue and an emergency health issue for a family member simultaneously - 5 days before Christmas. I needed  a company that could proactively handle my emergency plumbing issues quickly and professionally. Bottom line: An estimated 3 day job took a little over 1 day for the Dutton "A Team" to complete and the Christmas feast didn't have to be cancelled. Overall, communication was great throughout. Thanks Dutton guys and gals!</Text>< Pics>

Really quick service!  Almost immediately I had a text update, with a picture and name of my service provider to be expected (which is great for those that are unsure of who to expect coming into your home).  When he arriveded he immediately put on booties to keep my floor clean (which is bonus points, because I just mopped), he listened to my issues with the garbage disposal and sink, gave me advice on how to keep this from happening again (as well as what to expect), and fixed it in less than 5 minutes!
We'll be a returning customer for our future needs (just hopefully not anytime soon)!< /Review>

This was the second that a representative came out.  Randy was very professional, courteous, and he left my shower area clean .  I mean there was no gunk on the tile floor!  That was important since I can't get down on my  knees very well.< /text>

Our drains had backed up and Jairyo came from Dutton, diagnosed the problem - a clogged washing machine line - fixed it, tested it, double-checked it, and left the laundry room cleaner than it was before he came to do the job.  He is also unfailingly cheerful and polite at all times.  Five stars.</review>

Amazing. Will use again if needed. I used the CHAT service on their webpage. It was a call center, but, I shortly received a call from Tania at the company. She explained it was a Sunday, and had one driver handling emergencies. She let me know that I would be in the queue and she would keep me updated. First appointment was 1100 am. I received a call postponing it to 200 pm. Shortly after, they called back and said Randy was on his way. He arrived a 11:15, well within when he was expected.

Randy was personal and professional. He was clean and polite. We were even able to make small talk without distracting his work. Not only was the visit quick, but no shady upset tactics. I paid $73,00 as advertised. He had to cut tree roots out of a line outside of the house with one of his tools. Not only did I get great service, I received great value.

With any other company, I would have paid 2-3 times what he charged.< /review>

I was very impressed with the office staff. Very professional and friendly. I think his name was James and his coworker were very knowledgeable about the issue with my tank-less water heater. I would definitely recommend Dutton plumbing again, they saved me from cold showers in the morning.</Review>< Pictures>

Dutton plumbing was able to get out to our house the same day we called after discovering our hot water heater wasn’t working.  Everyone on the phone was helpful and professional.  The technician (Kyle) they sent arrived on time.  Kyle was very knowledgeable as well as friendly and professional.  Kyle diagnosed the issue quickly and provided several options and a recommendation based on his experience. We will be sure to call Dutton in the future and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to friends.</Text>

Best service I've EVER had in a plumber.  Been a homeowner for 45 years, never before encountered such integrity in a contractor. Called before they came, showed up when promised, cleaned up after, polite, efficient, very competent, no hard sell. Just absolutely a great experience. Marc was my technician, I spoke to Kayla in the office...  really really nice folks.  Recommended, without reservation.</text>

David came out to repair our water heater. He arrived less than 2 hours after we called. He explained the process and costs. While it turned out to be the more expensive problem of the two he described, I wasn't surprised by the increased cost. He did the work quickly and within about 45 minutes our water heater was working. He was professional and very pleasant.<//review>

Randy Arnold is a consummate professional who did an outstanding exploring, analyzing, and addressing the myriad of plumbing issues going on in my home.  Randy suggested ways to repair areas/parts that I plan to address in the very near future to keep the plumbing in my home optimized during use.  I couldn’t be more pleased with his knowledge, professionalism, diligence, focused attention, kind and friendly  demeanor-and commitment to getting the job done.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing for your plumbing needs, especially Randy Arnold who I will personally request for my next job!

< review>
Dutton staff are beyond professional - they are courteous and attentive, kind and polite. They treat you and your home with respect, using abundant covers to avoid tracking dirt and vacuums to minimize dust.  You get text  and images of the workers to ID who's coming to your house. I can't speak to value, because I didn't bother getting bids from other plumbers.  I will say that it's common to over-promise, and under-deliver in home repair (  workers "discover unexpected issues" that drive up costs and prolong repairs).  James advised us the work might take 3-10 days, but the Dutton crew did the work in 2 with no additional charges or up-sells. They addressed all our concerns regarding disturbing cabinetry and explained options and financing clearly.   If you got old pipes, call these guys.</review>

He is very knowledgeable, professional, friendly and respectful of other's property.  I have never seen anyone work as steadily and quickly as STEPHEN S.;  we had Larry, Tony, Cole and others here during the week, however, STEPHEN S., was the one in charge and he is excellent at what he does!

Juan R. And Cole were prompt, friendly, and courteous. Juan explained everything thoroughly and gave me options before he began. They came in last-minute and saved me from a weekend without a kitchen, even if that meant not having dinner until almost bedtime. I’d recommend them in a heartbeat, and I swear if Juan needed a kidney, I’d seriously consider being a donor.< /Text>

<Review>Took 3 separate visits over 4 days to fix our water heater. Forget trying to call them for "emergency service"--i.e. after regular business hours. They'll just send a notice to whoever's in the filed and hope for the best, without giving you any updates. Take your business elsewhere.< /Review>< user>

I called Dutton to have a kitchen sink cleared and did not expect the type of service I received. Mark was friendly and well informed. He came in; cleared the drain; provided suggestion on what may be causing the the stoppage and how it could be prevented moving forward. Great job Mark.<//Review>

Mark came out and cleared out our drain in the front yard and took the call at the end of the day. I was so grateful to get this resolved quickly since the plumbing company I usually call was booked up for the evening and would not be able to help till tomorrow. He greeted me with a smile and a handshake and in less than 30 minutes he had it cleared. In the meantime I think we got to know each other pretty well in that his great personality kept a conversation going through the process and I know I have found myself a new plumbing company! Great personality, great attitude and cost almost 25% less than my former plumbing company.</Text>

I have used Mark M. several times over the years. He's smart as a whip, knows how to do any job. I wouldn't use anyone else. He is articulate, knowledgeable, handles job quickly & efficiently and is the cleanest worker! It's as clean when he is finished as when he started! Terrific guy, well mannered and very friendly! Thanks Dutton for a great employee!</review>

Could not have asked for better care from the team and workers.  They were very good at explaining what needed doing and keeping me informed as to what they were doing.  There clean up when finished working was also great.  They are so friendlly, kind and helpful as well as good workers. Will definitely use them for all plumbing.<//Text>

Greg B is by far the BEST plumber I have ever worked with. Due to my plumbing problem my neighbor shut off all my water on a Friday night. I called Dutton on Saturday as I had heard they were the best company.
Greg arrived around 5 and didn’t leave til after 9.
Unfortunately my problem was not easily fixable through no fault of Gregs. HOWEVER, Greg did a temporary fix so I could have my water on for the rest of the weekend.  Greg came back on Monday and finished the job!!! I cannot recommend Greg enough. He is very kind and considerate! As important he is very experienced and obviously he knows exactly what he is doing. If I have plumbing problems in the future I want Greg to do the work!!<//Text>

<Review>Danny D was very prompt, respectful and knew what he was doing. He cleared the drains, fixed the leak, put in a new cap and even checked my water pressure - looking for a leak. I appreciate the ease of calling, making the appointment and getting the job done. I would recommend Dutton over many other plumbers I have used in the past.<//Review>< time>

My technician was Jay and he was very efficient, courteous and professional.   He gave me a quote for a repair and then due to my finances he had a different idea to reach the same goal.   I appreciated his honesty.< /Review>

The field rep Eric N was fantastic. He was polite, professional and resolved a very minor problem quickly and easily. Although the problem was in fact minor, other companies not only missed the problem, but caused the problem. He noticed it immediately! We should have called Dutton first.</review>

Marc R. and Billy were both professional and quick for installing a toilet in our single family home.  They maintained the cleanliness of a newly remodeled home, and checked to make sure the trash was removed.  The new toilet was tested, balanced and sealed around the base.  They demonstrated experience and seemed to enjoy their job.  The results of this  installation encourages me to use Dutton in the future, and recommend the company to my neighbors.</Text>

<Text>I am writing this review specifically about Randy Arnold, Technician for Dutton Plumbing. Randy came to my home today to perform a warranty-based replacement of my water heater's burner assembly and gas/temperature controller. Another Dutton Tech installed the water heater 4 yrs ago so it was still under warranty. Randy performed all the work in a very timely and excellent manner, and he was extremely informative every step of the way, and he was a really nice guy to boot. He answered all of my many questions and taught me a few additional things along the way. I highly recommend Randy.<//Text>< Pictures>

We have used Dutton Plumbing for several years at Santa Paula Animal Rescue Center and every time we have needed their assistance, they've been there, quickly and their service has always been outstanding!
Due to our needs, they have to visit us often and one of the plumbers even adopted a dog from us, who gets to go to work with him every day!  We are so grateful to have Dutton Plumbing as our service provider, which also feels like part of our SPARC family!  Highly recommend their professionalism and quality of service!< /text>

<text>Was told I would be in the first round of service for the day, ended up being the last call of the night. I had to call at least three times and demand to speak to a manager before getting a plumber scheduled.

The plumber barely spent any time looking for my sewer clean out. When it was not plainly visible, he then charged me $39 to come out and recommend I schedule a minimum $400 service with someone else. Called management afterward and was told I should not have been charged and would get my money refunded.

To say I am very upset is an understatement. I will not be using them again because of their inattentive plumbers and unresponsive call center. The only silver lining was that the supervisors and managers were helpful in finally getting a plumber out and for refunding my money.< /text><gmap_id>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140<//gmap_id>< Pics>

I was really impressed with the company. We needed a plumber quickly and I called Dutton.  Not only did they have someone come out within one hour, but they emailed me information on the technician and sent an email confirmation and then a phone call to confirm.

He provided multiple options on how to proceed and was very collaborative in resolving the problem in the quickest fashion while his skills allowed the repair to be completed without having to remove any of new tile work which would have added significant cost and time to the repair project.

I had a outside shut off valve that was completely rusted out and could not be turned off.  It took Brad less than an hour to replace the valve on the main water line going into the house.  The work was perfect and exactly what Brad explained he needed to do in order to safely repair the problem.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Ric was awesome! He was very courteous and understanding of my situation having dealt with another "plumber" who left my kitchen plumbing in a shambles. He answered all my questions, thoroughly explained everything that needed to be done and completed the work efficiently. I chose Dutton  because I had dealt with them on one other occasion years ago. Needless to say, Dutton made a great impression back then and evidently, nothing has changed! It's never pleasant when plumbing issues arise but Dutton definitely makes it easy. From the customer service reps who took my calls and followed up with me to Ric, the knowledgeable and competent tech who got the job done. These are the people to call. Thanks again, Dutton!😊< /text><user>102195518794996959779< /user></record></dataset><record>

Great communication received a phone call to verify I was still needing a plumber, then a call to let me know what time Ken Jr  was going to be at my house.  Ken Jr was very friendly, professional and right time, within minutes he had my sink drain flowing again!  He gave me some great advice for preventing backups for next time & also ideas of what needs to be replaced in a few years to help maintain. Thank you Dutton Plumbing for the great service provided just like what the radio says.</review>< userid>

Top notch service! The Dutton Plumbing crew is amazing!  We recently had a sewer connection problem in our front yard due to a poor installation made before we bought the home.  The problem came up with less than three days before we had an event at our home, expecting over 100 guests.  The Dutton crew came out, identified the problem, and began working on it within an hour.  They had to do a lot of digging (about 5 feet down!) to get to the problem.  My dad watched every step of the process from beginning to end.  They had to remove the offending connection, and then lined the existing old pipe with an epoxy liner, a major operation.  The three plumbers who worked on the job, Mark M, Juan Pablo, and Ricardo S were extremely proficient, answered every question my dad had, and even serviced other areas of the house plumbing so everything would be fully operational.  We cannot highly enough recommend Dutton Plumbing!< /review>

We had roots blocking the outside drains around our pool decking. Adam let us know his ETA which was very helpful. He was professional, courteous, knowledgeable and thorough in his explanation of the problem and the various solutions. He was up front on cost. He spent quite a lot of time snaking the multiple drains around the pool, pulling out the roots and when was finally done, I could see how well water now flows.  He was impeccable in his after job clean up. I would highly recommend Dutton Plumbing and would recommend asking for Adam who has been doing this for 31 yrs. If the whole team is as professional as Adam, this is a very good company.<//text>

Dutton plumbing is the absolute best when you have any plumbing problem!!
I have had the privilege of calling them out to my home 2 times now and there service is unbelievable!!!  I had a small plumbing company that I had used for several years until I got tired of them ripping me off and them not standing behind their work. My last experience was with Dutton’s service pro Marc R  who came and located a problem that was a sprinkler pipe issue and he did not even charge me after spending a lot of time finding the issue. Marc did inform me and quoted me a price that my house does not have a pressure regulator. Installing one will help to not create other issues with other things like toilets, facets etc in the future. I am making an appointment for that today.
Marc R was so professional and kind and had such a “CAN DO” attitude. It was very refreshing and Dutton plumbing should be very proud to have him on their staff.< /text>

Adam was very professional and courteous. He got the issue with our toilet solved by replacing the  deteriorating interior parts and made sure that the toilet water level was where it was suppose to be. He also checked the toilet  in our master bathroom, fixing  it so the water level was  correct, so it did not waste water as it was doing  before by running too long and not stopping where it should have.< /Review>

Seldom do I find a company that provides the quality service Dutton Plumbing incorporates into every aspect of their business.  From  appointment setting, sending an email confirmation which includes the appointment date with the name and picture of the technician.
To the most important component, an excellent technician, Steven Vidaca.  He did not rush into the work but talked with me for a few minutes as we checked the other plumbing locations in my home and yard.  He handled the issues I had called about but found an area underneath my sink that had serious corrosion and would soon be causing me real problems.  Steven was thorough, technically sound and very professional.  His customer service was excellent.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing and Steven Vidaca.< /Text>

They are very well organized in that they keep you updated as to when the technician is coming and don't give you unrealistic expectations.

Dutton was great. We called after hours, and they had someone over to the house within an hour. Dan was friendly, quick, and efficient. He was able to get our clog fixed with ease and made a frustrating situation much better. Thanks Dan and Dutton! We would use Dutton again.<//Review>

Tankless water heater annual flash & inspection.
Whole home plumbing review inspection, detailed report and report card including areas of concern.
Technician, Michael, was knowledgeable, clean cut, courteous, helpful and time efficient.
Dutton plumbing is not the cheapest plumbing provider, but I have learned the hard way you get what you pay for.< /Review>

They came almost the next day to replace my water heater. Ended up getting a new one through them instead of Home Depot because it was a good deal with a lasting warranty. Job was done fairly quickly and without delay. Both Danny and his assistant Leo were professional and friendly. Would use this service again.< /review>

<Text>I got a quote over the phone for $199 from Michael. When the plumber got here he gave me a quote of $549. This was to find a leak in a pipe that was in the dirt in about a 5' x 10' area. They were asking $549 to dig a hole to find a leaking pipe! Unbelievable! The quote I was given over the phone was for the same thing. The plumber said he would call the office. I watched him and he did not talk to anyone else. He came back to me and said $249. I told him to leave my property. These guys are scam artists so BEWARE!!!< /Text>< time>

<user_id>117280441409383413108<//user_id><review>i will NOT give less than a 5 star because of Jimmy the tech.

Jimmy was great.  He made every attempt to resolve the concern without giving up.  the tech was courteous, punctual and professional.

however, the only drawback were the 8 phone calls received from the office and call center.  redundant info such as confirming the address 6 times. the spelling of my name and will someone be there.

when i am at work, it was hard to stop work, drop my tool belt, reach in my pocket, take off my gloves to answer just to confirm information conveyed in the beginning.

this will not prevent me from using their services again, but hope this review will prompt them to review why they would overly ensure, with levels of certainty and continuous confirmations that the info they are requesting is as true the last time as it was the first time and every moment in between. (reading this review and typing it has the same effect--boring and monotonous).< /review>< time>

I had a simple clog that couldn't be resolved with a bladder or consumer-grade auger. Heard good things about these guys from a friend, so I called. My call was answered by someone who spoke english, and was able to confirm a time to call me back to set an exact appointment time (same day). I didn't get a call back initially, so I called and rescheduled for the following day as I could not wait at home any longer. After that, smooth sailing. The dispatcher called me that next morning confirming a time, and then the repair man called me when he got there. He was cool enough to wait a few minutes for my fiance to get there. It took him 25 minutes to fix the clog and he was on his way. The price remained consistent, no surprises. This would have been 5 stars if I had initially gotten a call back like i was promised. However that being said, I would absolutely use these guys again.</Review>

The tech and his crew were friendly and extremely neat and clean when doing the job.  Always able to answer any questions we had.  Stayed long and late but finished in in a very quick time frame. Re-plumbed the entire property in two days.  My family and i are very pleased and would recommend them to everyone.  Very professional group of guys right down to the drywall work to close things up.
Hands down, excellent work.
The drywall guy that they employ, DREW, does immaculate work, and he is very fast also.  Many years of experience showed in his quality of workmanship</text>

From the receptionist who took my call to the field service rep Joaquin my experience with Dutton was 5 Star all the way. They kept me informed on when they’d arrive and were on time. They quickly assessed the issues and fixed everything to 100%. They kept a clean workspace and were very respectful of the property and the people.

I’d hire them again without question.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>First , I would like to thank a lot for the technician from Dutton Plumbing come to my house to estimate the job i want to do is replace Water pressure regulator . I did refuse to do it because  for me I think the estimate like all the way going to the Mars not the Moon .

Thanks for not charge me for fee for the time the technician travel to my house that i do not agree  the estimate.
And thanks for the professional Customer Service from  Dutton Plumbing to contact me before and on the day of the appointment , and the technician coming on time and very professional doing whatever he has to do with his job for the company.
( His Name : Steven Snyder )

Second ,  I would say Dutton Plumbing want to charge me around $600.00 to $750.00 ( six hundred dollars to seven hundred fifty dollars) from the initial estimate from the technician for the job to do is replace the Water Pressure Regulator  ( included Part and Labor ) .

Wow,wow .... my eye likes to see July 4 fireworks and winning lottery  . is it true like the technician told me ?

After the phone call back to the office from the technician to get the price from the boss is : ... $ 600.00 ( six hundred dollars )
I think that price ...... too much ... unbelieveable .

( Home Depot >> part cost for 3/4 inches around $90.00 to $150.00 )

Even the  Part is $200.00 , how can the labor cost  $400.00 for the job to do less than 1 hour . ( I think for the technician to do is less than 30 minutes )

Finally , I ask for $250.00 to $300.00 to do the job but Dutton Plumbing is not agree .

Ok , I do it myself , I went to Home Depot buy the Part included tax around $100.00 and went home to replace  less than 30 minutes. It's working good now.

Again ,  I think Dutton Plumbing , very professinal company with good review from the customer

..........please charge for the job done with a reasonable price .

I'm not sure I want to call back Dutton Plumbing for any Plumbing problem need to fix .

That my thought .

Sincerely,

Andrew< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN68M_BASoMlA2rHNNH4ZZzC1LAgnPakY7GM4EZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<Review>Fantastic service!!   Two for two!!   Both times, problem was solved in a short time, very fair prices, and a fantastic in person experience!!  First visit was in 2017, for water pressure problems, and this visit today, was for a landscape drain blockage!!   Michael did a fantastic job today. And made sure I felt like my home Is protected from potential flooding, that almost happened last week with all the rain.

Thanks team Dutton!!    From friendly appointment setting, all the way through, to a follow up call, that happened before Michael had pulled away...</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Brandon and Paul came out to provide a second opinion for us today. We had been quoted a suspiciously low price for a sewer reroute by another company, and we wanted to see what other expenses we might expect. The guys did a very thorough inspection of our pipes using roof vents and clean outs and a high quality camera. From there, they determined that we did not have an immediate need for a reroute (we had been told that there was sewage leaking under the house and we should move on the reroute the same day). They were responsive to our initial call, on time, friendly, clear communicators, straightforward about their pricing, and--most importantly--were honest to the point of not advising a huge job right away. They will keep our business because of it.< /review><Date>1533672302802</Date>< Rate>

<Review>I had such a good experience with Dutton plumbing.  The issue I was having proved to be challenging, but the tech providing service, Jimmy, was helpful, informative and willing to try multiple alternative solutions to help minimize the disruption in my house and to my day.

He explained everything thoroughly, was kind to my dogs, respectful of my home and fixed the problem very efficiently.  I'd recommend him and Dutton without hesitation.  We've done a great deal of remodeling, in four different houses so I've had lots of service technicians in our home.  My experience with Dutton stood out as being entirely positive.  It takes a good plumber to turn a plumbing emergency into a good experience and that's exactly what Jimmy from Dutton did.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1505166748936, 'text': "Alane,\n\nOh my goodness!

<Text>When my kitchen sink clogged, I tried everything to fix it myself... without any success. I dreaded calling a plumber because of a few poor experiences in the past, but I couldn't avoid it. I looked Dutton Plumbing up online because I had just heard one of their radio commercials. From the time I got to their website, everything about my experience with them was absolutely great! There's a lot of helpful information there, the phone number is easy to find, and one of the nicest features is their chat service where a real, live person is waiting to help you! Within a few minutes, I received a call from a friendly, efficient representative who answered my questions, took my information, and advised me that a technician would be arriving shortly. Next I received a text message and email to advise me of the approximate time of arrival, a picture and a brief bio of the tech who would doing the work for me... WOW! Jimmy arrived on time, he was very professional, friendly, polite, he explained everything to me, fixed the problem, and cleaned up as if he had never been here. After he left, I received a follow-up call from Dutton Plumbing to see how the service was! I'm totally blown away! These people really take good care of their customers... a rarity. I will definitely call them again if a problem arises. And if you ever need a plumber for anything, I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing. I think you'll be just as amazed and I am with the quality of their service!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>100625686256421969168<//UserId.></record>

<Review>I want to give a massive shout-out to Dutton Plumbing and particular the service pro Jay.  Jay was extremely courteous and professional, in addition to efficiently fixing a pernicious clogging problem deep in the plumbing of several upstairs bathroom sinks.  Price was very reasonable and service was exceptional.  A definite five-star experience.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I was very nervous about calling a plumber due to the unknown cost and character of the company. I am new to the area so I didn't know who to trust. After looking at multiple reviews, I called Dutton; there wasn't a single review I saw that was less than 4.5 stars. Scheduling an appointment was simple, their staff is helpful and their customer service exceptional. I called them at 1AM on a Saturday and they got right back to me. While the repair was more than we had planned (not from a quote received by Dutton, just estimating based on internet searches), the service provided and Leo our technician, along with the warranty can't be beat. I plan to have them come out and do a comprehensive inspection of my home.  I believe they are trustworthy and that's very important to me.</review>

< Review>
Luis was awesome. The valve on the main water line to the house was busted and needed to be repaired. The entire fixture was really old and did not have a pressure regulator between the street and the house, so I was not surprised when Luis recommended that the entire fixture be rebuilt. He quoted us a number of options from the 'band-aid' fix to the long term fix. Once we decided which one to go with Luis completed the job quickly and we are very happy with the results. There may be other lower priced plumbers out there however given the great customer service and quick response I would definitely recommend Dutton.< /Review>

< Review>
I chose Dutton Plumbing for the second time.  The first was for two plugged shower drains -- excellent service then. Was introduced to a once per month powder to keep drains clear.  It's been a year and no problems with showers.

Saturday, December 12, 2015, my second experience with a plumbing issue.  Again, I was met with a courteous individual named Bryan Castaneda. He fixed the problem with a bathroom sink slow drain with complete skill; showed me the cause and how to avoid a future problem.

I'm completely satisfied with the performance and skill of the technicians and have recommended Dutton to family and friends if they have a plumbing problem. I also would like to note that they wear booties when entering the home and the cleanliness with which they perform the repair/service.

Thank you Dutton Plumbing.  You have a customer for life!<//Review>

Dutton Plumbing helped us in less than 24 hours with a plugged shower.  Brandon D. was very nice, easygoing, and handled it quickly.  He also gave us a product to use going forward so it will stay nice and clear.  Thank you very much.<//Text>

<text>Dutton Plumbing is the best! I'm so sick of tired of plumbers and other experts like electricians making appointments with me and either being late or just not showing up at all. Dutton kept me in the loop at all times, and once my appointment time came, Richard and Michael arrived to unplug my garbage disposal and kitchen pipes. The worked to get it unplugged, and did it professionally and competently. They strive to have 5-star reviews, and based on my experience tonight, they are certainly getting one. Thanks so much!< /text><date>1544841903820<//date><gmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140</gmapID>< name>

Juan of Dutton Plumbing did an outstanding plumbing job at my house.  He replaced two bathroom sink faucets with new ones, and he completely re-did an outside copper water line  that supplies a new irrigation sprinkler system and includes a new hose spigot as well. All the work was completed totally professionally and in a few hours it was all finished and leak-free of course. I appreciate the top-quality workmanship provided by Juan from Dutton Plumbing!</Review>

I have to say, this is the second time I've used Dutton Plumbing and once again they have really stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park. First and foremost, from my initial call to the arrival of the service team, everyone involved, Tania B., Dan D., and Leo B. took the time to answer ALL of my, how should I say it, less than intelligent questions and never flinched. The team at Dutton Plumbing kept me informed by e mail and phone about the arrival time and the names of the service providers who would be performing my needed repairs. Dan D. and Leo B. are just pros, plain and simple. They arrived on time, made the repairs and left nothing behind. Truly an exceptional experience!!! The team at Dutton Plumbing are professional, efficient and expert. Well Done Dutton!!!< /Text>

If your in the need of having your plumbing repaired DO NOT use Dutton Plumbing. After waiting 27 hours, yes 27 hours, for a technician to come repair our hot water heater they phoned to let us know they could not make it out that day. Horrific way to run a business. It they are that laxed in their scheduling imagine the proficiency of their technicians.< /review>

Used Dutton several times now, always a positive experience.  Telephone people are courteous to the max.  Technicians are always on time, friendly, clean, and ready to work.  They always explain step by step what they need to do, why, and what options I have.  Most recent experience was with Sean, but other techs have been equally excellent.  I don't plan on returning to my previous plumbing company.< /Review>

I'm very happy I called this company. I had went on Dutton Plumbing website and was so surprise how the company posted each
workers one by one about themselves. The "5" star rating I wish I could have giving a "10" star rating but it only goes "5" star rating,  the company had sent me Mr Ernie Rodriguez , this gentleman did a "PROFESSIONAL" job
going all through our home checking all the pips while explaning to me what he is looking for Mr Ernie Rodriguez took his time and did not do a rush  job in which I really like.  I'm sooooooo very happy Mr Ernie Rodriguez came to our home he did a GREAT job repaiing our toilet and flushing out our tankless water heater .<//Review>

These guys were awesome! They showed up quickly, assessed what needed to be done and took care of it. They even moved my new washing machine in place and hooked it up.  They also made sure my cat didn't run out the garage door. They were very friendly and professional and I would certainly call Dutton Plumbing again and ask for Matt D.< /text>

<Text>The news was terrible but the end results were great.  After Jay N. and Nicholas G. spent more then five hours trying to snake open the blocked drain, via the camera, a broken and impacted old metal sewer pipe was detected, of all places under the garage floor. In less than three days Jay N. and Juan P. and crew replaced roughly 30 feet of underground pipe,  mostly under the concrete, added two "clean outs" replace the "T", this was all done by only opening up a three by three foot square area in our garage floor.   Jay N. and Juan P. were super; courteous, polite and kept us informed through out the process, when completed the work area was cleaned, we didn't have to touch it.  I would highly recommend these guys especially with complex issues as ours due to their knowledge, work ethics and technology.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I recommend Dutton (and Adam) without hesitation for all your plumbing needs.  They did right by me, so I'm keeping their phone number handy for when needed next time.</review>

The plumbing technicians Juan R and James C did an excellent job of evaluating my service needs. They ultimately repaired a toilet and removed and installed a new garbage disposal. They were very clean, and not pushy. I was offered many choices for consideration. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is Dutton is very expensive in my opinion. However, they arrived promptly in the morning and got the job done!< /Text>

This review is for Diego Magaña from Dutton Plumbing. Diego came to fix a variety of issues at my house. He was very knowledgeable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. I had been looking for a specific replacement shower head for several years and had asked two previous plumbers who were unable to find what I wanted. Diego knew exactly what I needed and easily found the perfect one! I highly recommend him.<//Review>

I called Dutton because I had more then just a water plumbing issue with a newly purchased home. I had and issue with the gas line routing for the stove and a huge bird's nest of pipe and tubes for a reverse osmosis system under the kitchen sink that was leaking everywhere. Danny D was the tech that came to my house. He was very nice and was upfront with what he was doing. He fixed the leaks, re-routed the gas line, and we knocked out the documentation, then he left. Shortly after we noticed that sink only had hot water now and the stove needed an additional 90 degree elbow to get it to sit flush with the wall.

We called Dutton and they sent Danny back. Even though it was a Saturday night he stayed to figured out how everything needed to be and got it all working perfect. The previous owners had it so messed up he ended up having to almost re-plumb the entire sink. Great Job and thanks again for staying late to fix everything. that is one less stressful thing I dont need to worry about anymore.< /review>

Great Communication. Friendly Service. Had a pool drain rooted. Adam explained the issues, the risks, potential problems, possible extra costs, and let me decide what to do.

Turns out, thankfully, it was straightforward and everything got cleared out.

The home office also did a great job keeping up to date as to delays in getting to me.</review>

Service response was really quick. Emanuel arrived, the problems were assessed and repaired and he was gone again less than 2 hours after I called dispatch. It was awesome!</review>

I wouldn't recommend these guys to clean my toilet!
Unfortunately my handyman was not available so I called these guys to clear a drain.
They told me it was against there policy to use a rooter from the roof. They didn't attempt to use a rooter from anywhere else. They used a hydro jet for one hour but didn't clear the plug. Charged me $639.69 for the work.
Solution I found my handy man and he used a rooter from the roof. He cleared the clog in 5 minutes.  Also Dutton recommended having a new drain pipe from the outside replaced for a charge of $6,583. Since the drain has been a recurring problem I did want that done but not by Dutton. No I accepted a bid of $2,000 from another plumber to have the pipe replaced. The work is done and everything is like new everything works perfect. I feel stupid for ever calling Dutton<//Text>

Mark is amazing. He explained everything so clearly that even someone with zero constructional knowledge , like myself, was able to comprehend the problem and what needed to be done. He has a strong work ethic. He worked quickly to relieve the problem without compromising the quality of his work.  It was refreshing to see the pride that he took in his work. Not only will I recommend him to my friends and family but he will be the first person to request for ALL future plumbing needs. I could not have asked for a friendlier, competent plumber.</text>

Fantastic!
Brandon was professional, courteous, and able to take care of the drain in a quick fashion. I will definitely be calling them again if I ever have such a stubborn drain stoppage as this was.

Thanks Brandon. And thank you Dutton Plumbing for taking great pride in your service.
Sincerely,

< Review>
Hired Dutton for a sewer repipe. They were fast and professional. Everyone on the crew (2 different crews, 3 different days) were friendly and worked diligently. They're probably a little higher priced than most but I was very comfortable and confident knowing that they would do the job right, which they did. Special shout out to Mark M who really stood out as a five star employee. He's not just super personable, he actually knows his stuff too. He even offered to stop working and help my mother who became very ill in the middle of the job! What plumber does that? Will definitely be using Dutton, and hopefully Mark, for future plumbing disasters. 2 thumbs up!</Review>

Jaylyn arrived and was very pleasant from the start and let me know every step of the way what he was doing. He did a quick diagnostic and let me know exactly how much it would be.  Before he started working. After he was done he gave me some helpful hints on how to keep it from reoccurring and let me know the job is guaranteed for 90 days. He was very friendly and professional and I would definitely recommend him to anyone that had  plumbing issues as well asDutton plumbing. My first experience using a plumber was definitely a great one and a  very easy process.</Review>

< Review>
First of all, I would like to thank the technician John Williams who finished the job of replacing the water heater. He did an outstanding job and made sure all the codes are followed as per Federal and State.
Dutton went above and beyond my expectations. I never wrote a review for any services or business. This is my first online review ever. Thats bcoz Dutton has made a unforgettable mark on their service.

Infact the mistake was on my part on the pricing but Dutton took it in a very professional way to make it a smooth transaction. I never seen any business doing that. Right from the Technician John Williams, Helpdesk and to the manager Eric whom I spoke to was very respectful and patience in hearing my concern on the payment.

This is way beyond any service I have ever experienced. I would like to definitely give a 20 star rating If there was one. I have no words to explain beyond this.

Again I appreciate the service and professionalism by Dutton and their people. Thanks again.< /Review>

I called many companies before calling Dutton Plumbing. Why I didn't call them first is beyond me. That was my first mistake.  From my past experiences, they're the only company who always comes through for us. When I called in a panic for my client,  the associate on the phone, I believe his name was Dane,  was more than happy to help. He got right on it and followed up with me to let me know my help would be on his way at a certain time.  When the plumber arrived he arrived earlier than expected. Luis Z explained to me and my client,  the owner, what he found wrong and what the estimated cost would be to repair it.  Not only was Luis thorough but he price he quoted was even less because the problem was not as bad as expected. When Luis first arrived he put his booties on at the front door and as he proceeded, he was friendly, professional and very informative. My client,  her family and I give Luis an A+.  Thank you Luis</Text>

Scheduled fix was within a few days and was done in 2 hours.  The technician realized my situation was complex and brought his supervisor to evaluate as well.  This turned out to be great because he found an alternative solution that saved me thousands of dollars.  Thank you so much!  I will be calling Dutton again for any future plumbing concerns.</Text>< pics>

I am unable to locate your information in our system, can you please reach out to me directly at 805-367-5433 so I can help you resolve this? I want to make sure I figure out what happened here and correct it immediately.\n\nThank you!\n\nAndrew\nCall Center Manager"}<//Resp><text>If you want a service that doesn't do the job correctly, falsifies information/lies to their customers, provides terrible and rude customer service after they've been paid, breaks customers property without telling them, and refuses to return to fix a problem or get the job done correctly then this is the plumber for you! It took me over a week to get someone to my house for a job, which I get it, they're busy and I understood. Finally when the guy gets here, he goes to the wrong house. Eventually I tracked him down and he went and "completed" his job. Completed as in, it worked for several minutes afterwards and went right back to not working again. He also broke several things in my bathroom and left glass all over the floor. He ripped the toilet up from the floor so now when anybody sits on it, it moves all over the place. He also left the toilet cover on my counter/in my sink. Since I gave him the benefit of the doubt, I believed him when he told me he fixed the problem and never mentioned about breaking anything. When my two year old and I walked into the bathroom we got glass in our feet. I called Dutton immediately and told them what happened and that they needed to send their employee back to fix what he broke. They could have cared less about the glass in my sons feet let alone mine. The rep was extremely rude and said he would call me back, never did. I called again and re-explained the situation and that rep was just as rude as the one before. Plumber never showed back up to fix what he broke, and no matter how many times I've called I've never gotten a call back. I get it, accidents happen, but to break something and leave glass all over a bathroom floor especially when you're aware of small children living in that household has me without words. I went another week and a half without a functioning toilet until I had enough money after the money Dutton Plumbing stole from me. Still not fixed, and still no refund, broken property still not replaced. Thanks Dutton Plumbing!!!</text>< UserId.>

My experience with Dutton Plumbing and their service specialist was outstanding.  They were fast and very cautious. Checked out everything and made sure that I had options on how to solve my problems.  The work was done professionally and quickly.  The service Specialist Kevin was informative, professional and always had a smile.  The area worked on was cleaned up and left in very nice condition.  Sometimes it is also the small things that count like making sure they covered their shoes before entering the house.  I would use and recommend them anytime.</Review>

Dutton employees who've worked on my plumbing issues, from telephone arrangements and a follow-up call, to the excellent service techs Danny & Brian were been very friendly and professional.
Last year I purchased the silver level contract, giving me a full, detailed inspection prior to my recent work. My 40 year-old house had several things that weren't up to today's codes, as well as the usual hard water damage to the plumbing. There were no pressure sales, just recommendations and a convenient list so I was able to prioritize and plan if and when to have various things done.
I heartily recommend this company!</Text>

We appreciated Diego and the services he provided.  He knows how to listen well, was very professional, courteous, and supportive.  After listening to our issues, he assessed the situation and found the root of our leakage, presented the solutions and carried out the job within the time frame promised.  His team mate, Lon, was also very courteous.

We certainly do not want another water leakage problem but if we ever encounter one again, we know who to look for!

Diego, keep up the good work, you're awesome!  Lon, we know you're on your way!<//text>

Excellent plumbing company.  Easy to work with and prompt.  I had an unusual outdoor pipe leak and Matt D found it and fixed it which was amazing!  At first we thought we'd have to dig up the front walkway, but he found a way to work around that option.  I was so impressed, I signed a contract for their Preferred Customer package<//Review>

Kevin was very personable, patient and easy to talk to.  Even though the job was difficult and it was a very warm day here in the San Fernando Valley, he remained calm while dealing with my husband's many questions about the garbage disposal and hot and cold water dispenser he was installing.  He and his helper took their time in making sure they were the exact purchases we wanted and completed their job that day.  They left everything very clean and showed us how to work each product carefully, especially the boiling water dispenser.<//review>

<Text>For years, we'd been struggling with a plastic outflow pipe attached to our garbage disposal unit. After finally realizing no amount of duct tape or stacks of old VHS tapes was going to keep that pipe in place, I reached out to Dutton during a courtesy follow up call.

It's worth mentioning they did a great and major job with our upstairs toilet a couple years back, and they put in a new water heater before that.

Yesterday, Technician Ryan came by and took care of our pipe problem quickly and affordably. He was awesome! 10/10 experience, and I can only attempt to describe the joy I felt at basking in such a shiny metal pipe gleaming over a clean under-sink cubby. Thanks again, Dutton! You've got a customer for life.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Dutton Technicians Brad F. & Stephan S. were the best. Installed a tankless water system in my 66 year old house the same day. We are very happy with the system ,and applaud Brad and Stephen for their professionalism and ability to think outside the box for some of the challenges that they faced with an older house.</review>

<date>1412407909481< /date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I highly recommend this company if you need an honest accurate estimate for any plumbing problem. Everyone at Dutton Plumbing was very professional and curious.  I called for an estimate regarding a possible slab leak. The technicians arrived on time as scheduled.  I was greeted at my door by Matt; who immediately placed a clean mat on my door step, put on clean cover shoes over his work shoes. Matt accessed my situation very quickly entered my options with the exact cost on his iPad (which was very reasonable compared to other quotes I received). I opted for the slab fix..the by-pass option would also have fixed the hot water pipe leak in the slab. Within a 30 minutes Matt had located the exact location of the leak, and identified the hot water pipe. He prepared the work area, carefully removed 4 titles (without breaking them) and started the work to open up the cement to access the pipe.  Matt found the copper pipe with the leak. He then very carefully silver soldered the new pipe in place, wrapped the pipe with a thick rubber jacket, back-filled the hole in the slab, poured in quick drying cement to seal the floor. Matt’s work was meticulous, neat and professional. I am one happy customer ..and would recommend you call Dutton Plumbing if you ever need a professional plumbing job. Thanks again Matt for your expertise it is much appreciated.  Tony</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

My hot water heater sprung a leak at 1:30 in the morning and caused a pretty big mess. Water leaked out all night no matter how many towels I put in place. At 6:30 am. I called Dutton and explained my situation. Ryan and his partner Lon arrived at my house at 9:15 am.  They were both very polite and took the time to explain to me what needed to be done. The job was completed and cleanup was finished by 11:00.  I thought it would be an all day ordeal but Ryan and Lon were finished, the whole area cleaned and swept and I had the rest of the day to do as I pleased.  I am so thankful for their skill and professionalism, their understanding and helpfulness.  A great experience!</review>

After the "smell good plumber".told me they can't clear my main line from inside the house, but for $2200 they would add a clean out outside, I called Dutton and Edgar showed up, explained the work and cleaned my line no problem.  He was a pro, did the job and left the area clean.  Can't ask for more than that.... oh wait, they were $30 less than the other plumber too.< /text>

Then once the plumber came and was doing his tech stuff/slab leak locate-er stuff he started making comments that I really didn't need to hear. Nothing obscene, but I got the feeling that he wasn't confident in the work he was performing. I need confidence, I'm a family of 5, I don't need any uncertainty in the work that's going to be done, fixed and stay fixed.

Amateurs think, Professionals know.

I had a third opinion come out the following day and their findings were different. He didn't find the actual pipe that was leaking and said the leaking area was in a different area than the new plumbers, they are actually repairing/jack hammering it as I type. The job isn't even complete yet, so essentially I don't have a finished product/functioning water system, but I feel more confident in the guys working on it right now.<//Text>

Dan Denney and his helper we very clean (seeing their shirts were extremely white) and wore floor shoe covering when entering our home.

I had a terrible plumbing problem ( collapsed sewer line) on Christmas eve. Dutton Plumbing to the rescue and Kudos and many thanks to Sean and the Dutton Team for giving me a temporary solution to get me through Christmas and then a follow up to permanently fix the problem. The Dutton Team worked quickly, carefully and were very clear in what was the problem and how it would be resolved.

They truly are the best plumber in the community.<//Text>

Adam A. responded to our call to Dutton Plumbing regarding a clogged mainline.  He showed up and was very professional.  I would recommend Dutton  Plumbing to those in need of drain line clearing.  Their coupon is for $73.00 for one drain clearing.  I was waiting for the up-charge but it never came.  Thank you Dutton for for employing knowledgeable and courteous plumbers!  Adam definitely does justice for your company!  Thanks again.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Horrible customer service and no dependability.  Saw that they rated highly online and decided to give them a call to come evaluate and repair 2 broken faucets and a garbage disposal.  They scheduled the appointment for the following Monday from 1-3 pm.  As monday rolled around, they called only a couple of hours in advance to let us know they were too busy to make the scheduled appointment and rescheduled us for one full week later.  We agreed.  After waiting one full week, they called again, only an hour in advance to let us know that they were again, too busy to make the appointment and tried to reschedule for the FOLLOWING MONDAY!  To this we said absolutely not!  We cleared 2 Monday afternoons based on their schedule and lived 2 full weeks with non functioning appliances, only to be told they could still not service our needs due to their inability to schedule, plan and execute.  DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you want to be jerked around and left hanging.  Tough to imagine all of these positive reviews are real after our experience.  Extremely unprofessional!</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Mark came out to fix a stopped up toilet. It doesn't get much more professional than this. First, the company calls you to say when they are on their way. Then you get an email with the technician's picture and bio. Mark was very neat, professional and personable. He used rubber booties and assessed the problem right away. He laid down a mat so he didn't make a mess. The problem was solved quickly and resolved. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.<//review>

Ryan J. was a complete pleasure to work with.  He was professional, could answer all my questions, gave me options for the replacement of my old water heater, and didn't pressure me with a hard sell!  He and his assistant (Mario) completed the plumbing task promptly and with no mess left over for me.  I couldn't be happier with their work, and even paid for a year contract with Ryan J. as my plumber for that year.  I highly recommend Dutton Plumbing in general and Ryan J. specifically.< /text>

<Text>We were experiencing some slow drains.  We called Dutton and they were here in about an hour and a half.  Jay was very polite, made notes as I explained what I could about the problem.   He inspected under the building  (prefab) and recommended clearing the drain from the house to the street.  During the process,  he hit a couple of blockages that cleared out.  He also recommend a bio cleaner for the PVC plumbing.  Overall, fast arrival, thorough work, and pleasant service.<//Text><rate>5< /rate>< gmap_id>

I wasnt home when Adam came to my house, but both my daughter and husband went on about how professional, knowledgeable,  and pleasant Adam was.

Since I don't know a thing about plumber prices, I was kinda stunned at the price for the services I needed. Seems about average though.

Will definitely use Dutton Plumbing again if the need arises.

UPDATE: We ended up needing DUTTON PLUMBING again and Andy really was just as great as my family said. Will never use another plumber again!!< /text>

Oscar and David did a great job with my plumbing work today! They were very professional and knowledgeable, and went out of their way to help me out with my plumbing work. This is my second time using Dutton and I honestly would never go back to another plumber.< /Review>

Dutton Plumbing was wonderful, no waiting and wondering if and when they would arrive.  We received phone updates as to when they would arrive.  They were quick, clean, and courteous.  Ryan, Dave and Tyler are in our opinion the best plumbers in Simi Valley.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.<//text>

<review>This morning I had a dishwasher delivery from home depot,  they were going to install it as well.  I was told that they couldn't because the valve was frozen and I should call a plumber.  I called Dutton around 8am and they were at my house before 9..they were polite and professional....The did a great job and were able to install things necessary that the other old plumber had " forgotten" include... The entire job was done completely and quickly.  I spent more then I had hoped to but I fell the job was done right and have one less thing to worry about   Thank you Ryan and Mario    Susan</review>< Pictures>

Luiz was very professional and efficient. He stayed until approximately 8pm installing a new water heater. He took the time to explain all the inner workings of the new heater in terms that were easy to follow. We will request Luiz for any future plumbing needs. He is an asset to your company.

Adam A and his apprentice were wonderful. Unfortunately our problem is much bigger than we were hoping but these guys made it easy to hear. They were so personable and answered the kiddos questions. They were here after hours with such patience for our issues. I'd have had them over for dinner if I'd known our problem would take so long and still need attention. I hope they are the techs we get a second visit from when it's time. Thank you so so much Adam you truly were wonderful and your teaching technique is something to be applauded for! Thank you again guys!!</Text>

Matt D is very professional. He is so knowledgeable and gave me options on how to go about the water heater problem in my house; above all, he treated me like family. I know that if any of my friends and family have any plumbing issues in their homes in the future, I'll have no problem recommending Matt D and Dutton Plumbing!< /review>

I tried fixing it for three days myself but it would not stop leaking. Admitting defeat I called Dutton Plumbing.  They sent on over Steve S. who looked over the situation and gave me an estimate.  Normally I would have gotten three bids but after three days of fighting leaks that trashed my bottom cabinet shelf, I relented figuring if it was good enough for Mom, then go with it.  Steve explained the piping was the PVC pipe, gaskets and slip rings were old and best replaced entirely. After four hours of work, except for the Garbage Disposal, everything was replaced. The leaks stopped. Cost was not cheap but the fix seemed to be working and with a year warranty on their work, I was satisfied. Unfortunately the next day a weep formed under my right sink .  I called Dutton Plumbing and set up another appointment.  They wanted to send Steve out again to repair it but he was diverted for an emergency repair.  However they honored their warranty and sent out Juan P.  who determined another gasket was needed and fixed the issue at no further cost.  It is now three days later and no further leaks as of the writing of this review.  My wife and I say MOM Approves.< /text>< time>

Paul and Robert came to our mobile home to try to correct an AC water leak that 4 other companies could not repair because they would not crawl other the coach. Although they were unable to find the problem they referred me to a company they highly recommended.  Not only did they provide a service no one else would do by going under the house they did not charge one cent!! Now that is what I call great customer service and TWO GREAT GUYS.</review>

After a frantic call to Dutton Plumbing regarding 'no water' to our home, we were fortunate to have Randy Arnold from Sutton Plumbing come to our home in less than an hour to review and evalute the problem.
Randy not only knows his business extensively,  you immediately feel his compassion, awareness and thoughtfulness towards the homeowner and the 'crisis' they are experiencing.  After much thought and conversation between Randy and my hiusbanc, Randy fixed the problem.  He was extremely helpful and considerate in moving many long hoses from place to place to be sure that our horses had water while the work was being done and then putting the hoses all back in place.  We feel fortunate that our paths crossed and he will most certainly be the 1st person we would call in the event of another plumbing issue.< /Text>

Had a slow drain, called Dutton Plumbing, telwpjone service was quick friendly and accurate, followup for appointment was spot on, and when Adam arrived he was on time, and very professiinal. He made great suggestions and with an expert hand he had the root ball out of my drain and waters flowing. With roots in the system i know this is not a permanent fix, but he was informative and professional. I would recommend Dutton and Adam for your drain needs.</text>

<review>Bernardo Alcala was the service pro who came out to clear our sewer line.
He initially cleared the line but with the camera saw cement rocks that had come dislodged and would just clog up the line again in the future. He and his assistant Guillermo worked for 3 hours to remove the loose rocks from the sewer line "by hand fishing" with a coat hanger, the camera, and the 3000 PSI hydro jet. They did a great job, but what I admired the most was their persistence in making certain the line was clear and nothing left behind. These guys were friendly, knowledgeable,
professional and persistent with a can do spirit. They are a credit to Dutton Plumbing and I will not hesitate in calling them again.</review><user_id>113933622320404832814<//user_id><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

<Rate>5< /Rate>< review>
After having called numerous local plumbers who didn't bother to show up or even call back, I called Dutton Plumbing to fix an outdoor PVC pipe leak, and I couldn't be happier. Dan & Jake were 100% professionals and fixed the problem in 40 minutes. Even the dispatcher on their customer service line was helpful.

Ritz Plumbing tried and failed to fix the pipes 5 times in a row and - in fact, made the problem worse after each visit. After Ritz Plumbing gave up (and tried to extort additional money for warranty work), Dutton Plumbing was there to pick up the pieces AND show me exactly what negligence and shoddy workmanship caused my the leak in the first place.

Dan & Jake were knowledgeable, experienced, and more than helpful with their explanations and suggestions. They showed up ON TIME and within hours of being called. They even stayed on for an extra hour or so after the job was completed so they could test that the leak was indeed corrected. Dutton Plumbing warrants the work for 1 year after the visit and as Dan put it: "We will own our mistakes and not charge you extra."  Too bad more companies aren't like this.</review>

<response>None</response><review>Dutton pulled a bait-and-switch by trying to get me to agree to a $25,000 overhaul of our plumbing system for a basic repiping job, which should have cost 1/3 of that amount. The job would have entailed ripping up our front yard, and replacing a perfectly good, recently installed water heater. Then they proceeded to disparage another company we were considering. I will never work with this company.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Jay N. Was my plumber mainly and he was great. Very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating of my schedule. I had quite a lot of plumbing work done ( replaced 2 toilets, 2 sinks/ vanities, new kitchen faucet, and replaced main sewer line out to the street.). During all this work, dispatch sent other plumbers, who were also great. I would recommend any of the plumbers. My only problem was with dispatch, who did not seem to comprehend the scope of the work being done on a house built in the 1950's. Dispatch often would schedule Jay to come at 5pm, and he wouldn't be able to make it, as he was on another job and couldn't make it. So, if there was another plumber available they would send them, but that late in the day, it was difficult for them to complete a job. So, I feel that had the dispatcher used better judgement and gave the plumbers extra time to complete a job ( allow for old plumbing - things do go wrong ), my large job could have been done in a more timely manner.< /Text>

<review>After a long day, I had to come home and deal with a completely blocked sewer.  Having utilized Dutton Plumbing several times before, I did not waste any time deciding which plumbing company to call.  A quick call, followed by a return call to confirm the time frame when the plumber would show up, and not much longer after that, the plumber showed up.  Friendly.  Professional.  Considerate.  He got right to the job and took care of the problem.  Thank you very much!</review><GmapID>0x80e82ebed5b30749:0x6a99858c7f6e0140</GmapID><UserId.>106527604879288531184< /UserId.><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1492526031470, 'text': "T-wreck's S,\n\nThank you so much for this awesome positive review.

Awesome service ethics! Thanks Matt for helping us and fixing the recurring issue! I have First American Home Buyers Protection, and their contract plumbing company could not fix a simple issue. And they were blaming something which was not at all the main cause of problem. Thanks to Matt, he came and fix the issue the very first time itself!< /Review>

I am a young, single mother and Dutton's technicians basically tried to rob me. A 5 or 6 inch piece of exposed PVC pipe between two connectors on my sprinkler valve broke. I called Dutton and they sent their technician Matt out with another tech (not sure why they sent TWO people when I told them it was literally just a piece of PVC that needed to be removed and replaced). If I knew how to deal with the blue PVC cement I would have fixed the damn thing myself. So Matt and tech 2 show up and tell me "Oh, yeah that's an easy fix. We'll just have to dig around it a little bit and I'll charge you the exposed rate so it won't be as much for you." Tech 2 is in the grass kicking a soccer ball around with my daughter. They're really laying it on thick getting my guard down. So... now it comes time for them to rig up the invoice and get my signature... $450!!! Are you kidding me?! At first, because I have no idea what I'm doing, I was going to agree to it. Thankfully my roommate got home in the nick of time and told them that we would get a second opinion. My father came by and fixed it in less than 10 minutes. Dutton was going to rob a young, single mother of $450 for a $5 piece of PVC, some PVC cement, and 7 minutes of labor. How could anyone be so heartless and money hungry?< /Text>

I would get others to bid the work. My wife called these guys when I was traveling for work and asked them to hook up the washer dryer (we just moved) and fix a diverter. They charged her $500 and then tried to up sell her on $20,000 worth of work. We will call around next time and don't plan to use them again.<//review>

All I can say is... GET A SECOND OPINION!! ... I had 1 bath room with  a clogged sink and toilet.. They said my pipes were broke under the house and the one pipe in front was cracked.. They said I needed ALL new plumbing at a cost of $12,000.00.. I questioned this because the rest of my plumbing was working fine.. I said I thought $12,000.00 was slightly extreme and their answer was "Well we do financing"  They never showed me any pictures or video that was used during the inspection.. I told them no thank you and without any other options from them, they left.. I called another company who came with their camera and showed me that the main entrance where he used his camera had not even been opened due to it being covered with dirt and spider webs. He then had me watch the video of the inside of my plumbing (amazing btw..) to show me no broken pipes but areas where there was settling that was causing pooling and due to build up, caused the clogs.. He flushed out the pipes with a hydro hose and viola... no clogs.. Oh and there was NO cracked pipes in the front either.. He was gracious enough to show me everything that he was doing so that I could understand..He charged me $625.00... I don't know if that is a good or bad price for what he did but, I do know it is a far cry from $12,000.00..  Shame on you Dutton Pluming !! If I could give you 0 stars I would!!< /Review>

My first contact with Dutton was through Tania, who was super friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  I felt at ease working with her, especially after a negative experience with a previous service provider.  The appointment set up was very easy and when I was unable to keep the initial appointment, the dispatchers called back right away and followed up the next morning with a "first call of the day" appointment.  My technician was Kyle.  He was on time, friendly, reassuring and expert in his work.  He showed me everything that he was doing and explained the problem (which was due to some apparent ineptitude by the previous service provider.  Kyle didn't try to upsale me on any services.  He pointed out options that would save me money in the near and long term.  I was very satisfied.  My only regret is that I didn't call Dutton the first time around.<//Review>

Juan was very professional and explained the entire process with us.  He introduced the other workers and what they would be working on each day.  He called to let us know who would be at our home if he was not here himself.  Juan and his crew were very careful to cover their work  area to limit the dust and wore botties on their shoes when entering our home.  This was a very painful experience for my favorite family but Juan made it as easy as possible for us and because if this we are very grateful to him.  He is a very hard and knowledge worker.  Thank you<//Review>

Called 4 times, spoke with Katie 2 times, she was nice but the technician never called me back. In their defense I called 5 plumbing companies to look at my non-functional water heater. NO ONE WOULD CALL OR COME OUT TO MY HOUSE!!!!!!  Money was not a problem, my landlord is paying for it. Is it possible that all plumbing companies have so much money and are so busy that they can't even call back??? Cold showers won't cut it in the morning. I will fix it myself tomorrow or find someone who cares enough to at least call back!  Shame on all af you! My kids are going to suffer through freezing showers in the morning I hope you you are happy. VERY WEAK!!!!</Text>

<Review>My tech was Kevin K.  He was fast, friendly, and cleaned up very well after himself.  I had a broken toilet seal.  He investigated the area, asking for what I had noticed, before coming to the same conclusion as I had.  We ended up having to replace our toilet, as it broken after he removed the base screws.  He work quick, he cleaned up very nicely, and explained everything he found, he did, and to look out for in the future before he left.  Great job Kevin!

The plumber was courteous did some clean up of water damage.
He cut 2 rectangular holes in the ceiling, wallboard, I guess to drain water.
My question now is who is going to repair the cut holes in the ceiling?
Please advise.<//Text>

<Review>Nick G is a super professional guy with tremendous amount of patience, courtesy and knowledge. I wish most of service guys and gals are like him. He takes tremendous amount of care and listens to the customer. He is persistent and won't quit till he fixes the problem. Two other plumbers gave up before him but he kept snaking till the back up was all cleared. Super fantastic guy. Don't make him a manager coz you need more people like Nick in the field who are great testimonial for Dutton! Thanks Nick!</Review>< pics>

<text>Terrible!!  They claim "Outstanding Customer Service" and " a plumber you would send to your mother house"  Canceled my appointment with them 3 times!!  Always calling at the last minute and making some sort of excuse.  Talked to a guy named Vince- who as sharp as a marble, and seemed totally lost in trying to come up with an excuse.  Ask for the owner of the company to call me.  Took time off all three times to be here for them.
TOO MANY GOOD PLUMBING COMPANIES OUT THERE- RUN FROM THIS ONE!!</text></record>

Diego did a good professioal job repairing our M Mouse plumbing situation. He did the job in late July 2018.  He came back,  as agreed, in August to hook up the drain line for our dishwasher after we got our RO issues corrected. .
Diego is polite, patient,explains things well and was alwaye careful to wear shoe covers.< /Text>

Danny D and Leo B provided service for our residence on a leaking faucet and water pressure regulator. Danny was the main technician and Leo assisted him. Danny was very knowledgable, professional, courteous and friendly. He took time to explain the problem to us, how he planned to approach remedying it and the relative costs. As for expertise and professionalism, their service was excellent. I was especially pleased by Dan's positive professional demeanor. They were prompt, finished the work within the quoted timeframe, explained their process beforehand so we knew exactly what services we were receiving, and they left their workspace as clean as they found it. As for cost, we have worked with less expensive plumbers in the past, so Dutton is not the most competitive provider in terms of pricing, however with Dan's professionalism and a very organized business service model (we have not experienced a more organized effort, from front office to completion), customers can reasonably expect to pay a bit more than what a sole provider/owner-operator would charge that doesn't offer such a comprehensive service model, which includes your initial call, prompt scheduling, phone updates, e-mail updates and accurate time estimations for both technician arrival and work performance. We might have been able to shop around for a cheaper solution since this call was not an emergency call, but overall, we feel we have received value for our dollar.<//review>

<Text>This past week I was in need of a plumber.........Mon., 12/23 I called and Tues., 12/24 Matt D from Dutton Plumbing came to my house.
When I initially called, I told Vince that I needed muscle and not brains for a pretty simple job with one small glitch.
Here comes Matt with the muscle AND the brains to solve the glitch that two other people could not! And with the brains came a big heart. Matt is the complete package.
Dutton Plumbing is very, very, very lucky to have Matt D. And I am lucky to have Dutton Plumbing to call when I need help.
Thank you Dutton and thank you Matt.

OK, so here's the deal. Supposedly................the 2nd time is never as good as the 1st, Well not with Dutton Plumbing. Matt D far surpassed his 1st visit. Here's the fun part, he was with another plumber named Matt.....so I just called them Matts. They did a beautiful job. Thank you Dutton and thank you Matt D.

Not only were they quick to come out but they truly sincerely care about their customers and will work with you. Since then they've helped replace parts on or water heater and most recent unclogged a shower drain. Everyone from their dispatch to technicians are knowledgeable and polite. Best of all their prices are reasonable. I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of. They will continue to be our "go to" for ask my plumbing needs. Thank you Dutton!!</Review>< pictures>

<text>My experience with Dutton Plumbing was excellent. The service Pro was Rich B. He explained all
my options in great detail and pointed out some very bad issues that had developed. Over the last three weeks my 1961 home needed a complete new pipe replacement. Since this requires going through the cement foundation I saw many Dutton employees. Dutton had every type of specialists needed to do the job. They were all very professional and knew there jobs. They finished the job when promised and put my house back the way it had been.< /text><userid>111706874528821399437<//userid>< Name>

Two days before Christmas and everything in my house is backing up into my tub. I tried to fix it myself, and got nowhere. I called up Dutton at 3:30pm and they said they could get someone out there that afternoon. I got a text with a quick bio and picture of the Plumber that would be out, his name was Felix and was great. At 5pm he arrived. He crawled under my house to check the plumbing, made a quick assessment and advised me what I may need to do in the near future since my plumbing was so old.

I sat down with my wife and let him work and after a short while I heard that beautiful sound of water draining. Wrapped up quick afterwards, gave me a few tips and took my payment, which was great at only 73 dollars (with their special for clearing drains).

I was very happy with Felix and the entire experience with Dutton, and would highly recommend them.<//Text>

< review>
I have been a faithful customer of Dutton for over 15 years.  Thursday night around 9pm I entered my garage only to find my hot water heater leaking water.  I immediately contacted Dutton's 24 hour emergency service number plastered on the front of the hot water heater they installed, only to find out that they no longer provide 24 hour emergency services and that some one would contact me the next day. I could not wait and had to search for another plumber in the yellow pages.  Another came to my rescue and turned off the water heater, disconnected the gas line after turning it off and drained the tank of the remaining water.  I could not for the life of me understand a plumbing service not offering 24 hour emergency services.  Dutton came next day to offer to install a new hot water heater for an astronomical cost.  I searched the Web and believe I found an excellent new plumber and they are installing my new hot water heater as we speak and at half the cost of Dutton's quote.  And they offer 24 hour emergency services!  I have a new Plumber!
GOOD-BYE DUTTON!</review>

<review>Returned home from a vacation to find a broken pipe in my front yard and had to shut off the water from the street.   Call Dutton Plumbing and was told that someone would be out between 8 and 10am.   Ryan J showed up at 8:45.   20 feet of galvanized piping need to be replaced with copper and Ryan recommend installing a ball shut off value.   Ryan gave me price up front with no hidden cost.   Ryan was able to restore water to the house while he replaced the broken pipe.    He finished the job with in 2 1/2 hours and my yard looked like he was never there (minus the pool of water).   Ryan was very polite, clean, explained everything he was going to do and answered all of my questions.   Thanks Ryan.    Dutton prices are higher then other plumbers but the quality of work and service you get I feel it is worth it.< /review>< pics>

< review>
My parent's just purchased a mobile home and the hot water heater was broken. They called Dutton Plumbing to come out and Diego was the technician at that time. My dad being a contractor was sure we would have to replace it. Diego could have easily taken their money and replaced the water heater with no complaints from them but instead, he took his time, looked everything over and found a fantastic solution to not have to replace the whole water heater. In the end, Diego saved my parents over a thousand dollars and was extremely friendly.

After that Diego and Kevin came out because the water system that is currently in the house is horrible. They were friendly and professional while bending over backwards to get my dad the price he wanted and my mom the system she wanted. The manager Shawn was also awesome in working with Kevin. I highly recommend them!</review>

Adam arrived on-time to clear several outside patio drains that were heavily impacted and did a fantastic job and spotless clean up!

The technician was great and he did an excellent job.  He was  curtious and friendly.  He explained what he was doing.  Should get a raise. The only complaint that I have is that the cost of the job was outrageous for 2 hrs of work putting in a faucet.  Which was an automatic charge.  Approx. $460.  Dont  think I would use them again 2nd time the price was way over charged. Not doctor's or lawyer who always over charge.  Tech was great thou.

They quickly schedule a plumber to come fix my broken shut off valve for the backyard irrigation so there would be no further flooding.  I received an email shortly thereafter with a picture of Jake M who would be coming to fix my broken valve.  When he arrived, he discovered that the shut off valve from the city was frozen shut, so he had to call DWP to come and close the valve.  They said it might be 2 - 3 hours or longer, and he told me just to call him whenever DWP showed up and he would come back and fix my broken valve.  He then called DWP to have them come turn the water back on, and, since he could not test the new valve he installed, Jake showed me how to check it.  He said if there was any leakage to call him and he would come right back and fix any problems.  I know the complication with the city's valve made extra work for him, but I was not charged any additional fee, and he got me a $50 discount coupon because I called after meeting Dutton Plumbing at Starbucks.  I could not be more satisfied for the professionalism that Jake demonstrated, and his willingness to see the job through no matter what extra time or inconvenience arose due to outside complications.  Without reservation, I extend my highest recommendation for Dutton Plumbing because of the outstanding service that Jake provided.<//Text>< pics>

Had Dutton plumbing come out for a yearly check up of my plumbing, something that Dutton offers to their existing customers.  ANDREW E. Come out and was very professional and  very friendly.  He took his time and explained exactly what was going to happen and what I should expect from his visit. If all of Dutton's plumber are as professional as Andrew E. They could sure count on having a life time customer.
Thank you Dutton for sending Andrew E. To my house.</Text>

Response time is second to none.  I always get a call an hour prior to arrival confirming they are on their way.  This time when Ken got here the toilet was leaking (go figure).  He checked everything out inspection-wise and suggested we replace a few minor things which we could do ourselves and the charge was zero.  What other company does that????!!!!!<//Review>

<text>It was late morning on a Sunday when we had a water leak under our kitchen sink and  laundry room.  We were able to manage until late afternoon when the technician arrived.  Armando was clean, polite and responsive to our questions.  He also wore protective covers over his shoes  and used a  floor mat to protect our floor, which we appreciated.  Before starting the job, he explained our options and associated costs and did not pressure us in any way.  He was extremely conscientious and tested all of his work before leaving our home.   It was refreshing to have a technician who actually took pride in his work.  We felt the pricing was fair and would definitely recommend this company.</text>< Pics>

Dutton Plumbing went above and beyond our expectations. We had a slow shower drain for a few days then it erupted into a full on blockage that left us without service. We called at 7am and by 9am Adam was at our door. I took him right to the backyard where the septic was backed up at and Adam went to work. He was friendly, professional and knowledgeable. He made a few expert suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again and what may need to be diagnosis for future septic issue that will occur later due to age of plumbing system. Unlike my experience with other plumbing companies, Adam didn't try to pressure me to buy any unwanted or unnecessary repairs. He fix the problem and made some suggestions. I would highly recommend this company to any homeowner who is tired of being taken advantage of and who just wants great quality professional and on time repair. This is the company for you.< /Text>

I've used Dutton Plumbing for my home for many years.  They have  always been prompt, explained what was happening and how to repair the problem, and gave a quick and concise cost estimate for the project.  Ultimately I've had the entire house repiped to eliminate those ongoing annoyances that happen in an older home.  So far so good.  Many crews have been to the house, have performed their duties and left the property clean.  Matt and his apprentice Jake on the final day of the latest project were quick and left the area clean.  I use Dutton for all my plumbing needs.< /review>

<text>We've been on the family service plan with Dutton Pluming of a few years now.  The annual service inspection includes a water heater flush, general pluming inspection and Bio-Clean drain treatment.  Our house is over 20 years old and has its share of plumbing issues.  To prevent these issues, Dutton Plumbing installed a pressure control regulator 3 or 4 years ago, but warned the hard water in the area would take its toll.  This year we had two more leaks.  We requested Luis Zamarripa as our annual service technician.  He is an excellent, dependable technician and he drives PINK DUTTON PLUMBING TRUCK.  10% of the profits from the PINK trucks go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
Luis recommended a whole house water filter to which we agreed.  He included the leak repair and did an excellent installation job.  We got an 18 month same as cash deal so it was very affordable.
Great job Luis Z.  Larry C. you have a great team!

We had Luis Zamarripa back on 9/12/18 to install a pre-purchased RO unit under our kitchen sink.  The installation concerned me because Luis Z. and Lon Ralston had to cut a new hole in the sink to mount the RO faucet.  The installation was perfect. No cracks in the sink, which is over 20 years old, and NO LEAKS under the sink.  I've been told that can be a common problem with RO installations.
Additionally, Luis and Lon, replaced our old dishwasher air gap.  We requested this extra work and asked for the air gap to match our upgraded sink faucet.  The match is a good one and the Luis and Lon's workmanship is excellent.

Dutton Plumbing maintains its 5 STAR rating in my house!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>An excellent employee and a hard worker.
I had what looked like an easy job at first but the guys who rebuilt this house put a lot of curve balls in for the poor Heyner.

Well he did not give up and kept on trying other solutions. All while my kids kept on asking if he liked monster trucks, cars, movies, horses, how old he is, what are you doing.
He replied always with a smile and got the job done.
Cleaned up thoroughly after the main job was and had time to talk options for payments and contracts.

Bravo!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>Anders Selim</user_name>< Response>

Matt was fantastic! He was extremely knowledegable and helpful. He would not give up until he found the cause  of our mysterious leak. He even stayed to be sure that was the reasoning.

I am rating Dutton Plumbing POOR for price not for any other reason. A few months back...I was trying to install three faucets in my house when I found one of the old ones... "water flex hose" refused to come off....it's always something when I fool with plumbing. I didn't want to force it because then I would have to shut off the main. Sooo we were forced to call a plumber. We found Dutton on line and they came within 2 hours. Nice truck...3 guys...it looked like a trainer and 2 other guys. This was a very simple job...just remove the stuck hoses and finish putting in the faucets. When I asked about the cost...they referred to a large book that already had all costs printed for any kind of plumbing job. FOR My 20 minute job they would charge around $300....which is really insane!!! I think the only way for me to get the price down to around $200. was to install the faucets myself...while these 3 guys looked on and then they hooked up the water flex hoses  in 10 minutes....according to their book that would be cheaper???? ...incidentally after they left one of the bathroom sinks was leaking when the water drains....but I didn't dare call them back!!!  I will never call them again!!!<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Brett P and Tyler dug out and capped a buried gas line at a city Public Works yard. They saw-cut and jackhammered asphalt, then dug down 2 feet to reach a joint and place the cap.  This was a physically demanding job that took a full day. Both guys were great.  They worked safely and efficiently, and never complained.  They also cleaned the work area thoroughly afterward.  Brett's equipment was in good shape, and neatly organized in his truck (I always look for this with contractors). I would hire them again anytime.

O K guys ,,,, let us have people to perform trades like Mark and we will all be survivors of the mass of lying "contractors" that take our money and provide promises for tomorrow.
Mark an his worker SOLVED problems that were out of their realm of or scope of what they were called in to work on.
This is usually only found in an owner''s work ethic except the last 6 sbusiness owners that I have had over here for projects ,,,  requested prices well shall we say ,,,  we'll in excess of the going rate,,, as well as two companies which drew me in based upon FALSE weblistings......   claiming that they had no idea ..... yea right ....</text>

<Text>My technician was a nice guy, and very knowledgeable, and I would have liked to do business with Dutton, but his $1,150 estimate to replace a garbage disposal was ridiculous.  He also bid to replace a gas line on my water heater to the tune of $480.00.  I can only assume that Dutton puts out totally unbelievable bids knowing that a few customers will actually give in and pay their outrageous rates.<//Text><UserId.>112470316933134341287</UserId.>< Name>

I was so impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of Felix. He was knowledgeable about all the things I had concerns about. His answers to my many questions were clear and unhurried. Felix was able to complete the repairs my house needed and I was able to plan for upgrades of equipment I would like to install.
My house was built in the 1960's and I have wondered many times how I could protect my home from possible pipe breakages or who I could call if these "water disasters" occurred. I know that Felix and Dutton have my back. Thank you so much!< /text>

<text>Chad arrived on time, introduced himself, and was dressed in a clean uniform. He placed shoe covers over his shoes to keep my carpet clean.  I explained my plumming issues to Chad. He listened and repeated the issues back to me, to insure he understood my concerns. Chad inspected the parts in questions, he pointed out the problems, and provided me a short tutorial on the function of each part.

Chad provided me with several options to repair the damaged parts along with the final costs for each option.

The work was completed in a timely fashion and Chad left the area clean.  I was shown the new parts, as well as the old parts Chad removed. Chad was personable, professional, and I felt comfortable enough with Chad that I left him in my home alone while I ran several errands.

I would use Dutton Plumbing for my future needs and Chad represented the compony well.</text>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>4.6 starts really, 5 if he had been lucky enough to guess to try clearing the clog from inside first instead of from outside the house, and if he had made it a little more clear there would NOT be any high-pressure sales pitch regarding what keeps causing our clogs.  Persistence paid off and a 30 minute effort turned into almost an hour as his second guess worked.
Mark arrived quickly, was very professional, was clean even though it was a 7 pm call, asked if we wanted a free scope run the next day to find out why we have these issues every year or two now, and only charged us the $73 basic fee for a clog with access.  They just left after the scoping and THERE WAS NOT EVEN A LOW PRESSURE SALES PITCH.  The Mike Diamond commercials sound OK, but Rusty Dutton beats their price and they both seem to have the same exclusions and conditions for unclogging drains.  MARK M. at Dutton Plumbing has our business to deal with. . .um. . . 'our business'.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Ryan was nice but the cost of my repair was way more than I was expecting it to be. A $22 toilet tune up ended up costing $297. My neighbor who is a plumber asked to look at the repair and said the parts were about $10 so now feel really ripped off. Very upset with Dutton plumbing and will not ever use them again!

I would now like to add that after speaking with an extremely nice man named Andrew, everything was made right  and am back to only paying the original $22. Am so happy that they took care of this in such a professional way and would now rate them 5 stars. Thank you Dutton Plumbing.< /Text>

After some confusion using the chat on the Dutton website I received immediate assistance from Olivia on the phone. Within minutes of speaking with her David Walker's info was received by email and text. David arrived within the hour and rectified my water heater problem in minutes. He then offered to service the water heater for less than the cost of a service call from a home warranty company. He cleaned the sediment out, checked all the gas connections and parts then blew any dust and creatures away. He was done in 45 minutes. I have used Dutton before and have been very happy with the work. I have always recommended them.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Consumer beware. I called Dutton plumbing for a leak in the drain pipe to my washing machine. The plumber looks at the job site and immediately tells me that the cost of the repair will be $2200.00. I was floored. Then after I told him that i would get other estimates we couldn't get him to leave.He kept talking about this and that and when he found out that we had a cat he talk another 30 minutes about how great cats were.I did find a legitimate plumber and they did a great job. The cost $240.00.

I want to thank Dutton Plumbing for the work performed at my house. Every aspect of the experience was first class - from setting up the appointment (your office staff is excellent) to Kevin Kalin and his crew arriving at the scheduled time.
Kevin's professionalism immediately put me at ease, he and Paul Belcher thoroughly explained what the job would entail, gave me a quote and competed the work that day as promised at the price they quoted, no surprises. Great job!

I am not sure where to start because I have had half of the Dutton field technicians here at my home over the past 3 weeks.  I live in a home built in 1965 with old galvanized pipe under my tri-level home in my lower bathroom.  This pipe had completely deteriorated and not draining at all to the street sewer line.  My technician assigned to my overwhelming project was Diego Magana, under his manager Paul Belcher.  This crew managed to get me financing in order to move forward with  correcting my plumbing problem.

Over the three weeks, they worked with me on scheduling the time to get the job done.  My home was their concern and they were very careful to see that the area they had to work was kept as clean as possible while they jack-hammers my lower level floor to get down to the pipes for replacement.

My thanks go out to not only Paul Belcher and Diego Magana, but a big thank you to the workers that dug the 4.4 foot hole, then the refilling and and getting the bathroom back to  the its former order.  They did a great job.

Some of these workers are:  Miguel, Edgar P., Edgar B., Manuel, Luis and Noel.  I hope I got all the names of those that were here and I hope I did not miss any names.  A big thanks you to all.  They all did a great job!!!!</text>

<text>I had to have a water heater replaced. I called about 4pm on friday night. Kevin Kalin from Dutton arrived less than one hour later. He was accompanied by another tech. Kevin explained what had to be done and gave me an estimate. Both Kevin and his helper were professional and informative. The workmanship was excellent. Before they left, Kevin said if for any reason, I had any problems, to call right away and it would be attended to. Should I have further plumbing needs, I will call Dutton Plumbing.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Bryan C from Dutton Plumbing came to our rescue today!  Our plumbing was clogged - affecting 2 bathtubs, 2 toilets and 3 sinks.  We called Dutton plumbing and Bryan was at our house in about an hour!  He assessed the situation and flushed the lines.  Another field team member came to help thread a camera through to find the problem.  Unfortuntately, we got an estimate for a big job that needs to be done but we were aware of our home's plumbing issues and were expecting it.  Through it all, Bryan was super courteous, knowledgeable, professional and friendly.  We would definitely recommend both Bryan and Dutton plumbing!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1468335152831, 'text': 'Thanks, Ermelinda!

It was a disaster. i had requested only preventive maintenance for main drain. Technician came on 9/30/2017 and three days later I had a drain completely clogged. My guess that Manuel T. (tech. name did the cleaning in dry or did not get to the street level. Anyways when I called the Dutton Plumbing about this emergency they sent to me the same guy and he suggested to me to change the drain. This advice I am getting for already 15 years because there is a crack in the pipe. Not much to add, he was not up to helping but rather trying to proof that he did a good job in the first time two days earlier. I am greatly disapointed with Dutton and would like share this experience to help somebody and avoid this so called "plaumbing service"

<text>I had Dutton Plumbing do a complete Main line replacement and water line replacement including new tankless water heater's at my 4 Plex rental property.  Chad Schull was lead Technician with Paul Belcher as Dutton Plumbing  Management Technician.  I was able to count on Chad and Paul to make sure this large job was done quickly and correctly with the least amount of inconvenience to Tenants at the Property.  Chad worked after hours to insure Tenants had Water and hot Water with only a few hours of water shut off.  I had excellent communication from the Company and with Chad and Paul as to all factors concerning the job.  I new upfront what the job would intel and how much it would cost.  Dutton Plumbing stands behind it's work and I have a 20 year Guarantee on parts and labor. I believe it is well worth the cost to have peace of mind that all work was completed accurately with a Guarantee.  I would highly recommend Dutton Plumbing Company to anyone and especially to someone that has a large job and needs a large crew to come in and complete job quickly and have it  done right!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Name>Leah Rae<//Name><Review>We had a drain backup in our shower. We called dutton plumbing and they offered to send someone in 15 mins. That was too soon for us, so they worked around our schedule and sent a technition when it was more convenient for us. When Ramiro showed up he immediately handed me his card and told me his name and that he was with dutton. He wore the shoe covers and came with me to inspect the drain. Before beginning work he confirmed the price we were quoted over the phone. He worked efficiently and professionally. We had an excellent experience with Ramiro and with dutton plumbing. Very professional.</Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Called Dutton Plumbing (Simi Valley) for a sewer main clog. Dutton cleared clog but but their lead plumber, Sean Goldate, said I needed sewer main replaced $14,000+. Next, Sean from Dutton said he found a bathroom tub leak and he would have to rip-out the vanity and wall to get to it, he wanted $4,000 to fix this. DUTTON TOTAL WAS $18,000 TOTAL. Got a second opinion form Jim Beck Plumbing. FOUND OUT SEAN FROM DUTTON LIED ABOUT THE SEWER MAIN - MY MAIN WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION (PVC MAIN). JIM BECK ALSO FIXED THE LEAKY BATHROOM TUB. JIM'S ENTIRE BILL TO ME WAS ONLY $150. Dutton Plumbing of Simi Valley (owned by Eric Dutton) RUNS A VERY UNETHICAL OPERATION. Dutton plumbers are cheats and liars. DON'T GET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, DON'T LET DUTTON NEAR YOUR HOME!< /Review>

<Text>I had a leak inside my bathroom wall. That particular problem had happened before and had been repaired by Dutton. Unfortunately i was just out of warrenty. The plumbing tech Brett P. arrived within his appointment window.After a little conversation Brett realized I had used Dutton for other repairs (new water heater, outdoor pressure valve, clogged drain, shower leak) Brett/Plummer called his field supervisor and got permission to honor our exp warent. I had not told Brett, I was thinking of switching service as Dutton can be pricey. Brett came in kept our house clean, was clean and personable himself. he  broke through the wall, repaired our leak and and cleaned. the he did was neat clean and done right. Brett if you read this thank you. Your work and presentation has kep me a Dutton customer. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. Thank Dutton<//Text>< Pictures>

Called Dutton office at 7:00 AM, they said someone would be there between 9-11, no problem, then got call saying they would be there in 30 mins, they showed up almost 45 mins, again no problem.

The plumbing problem was a broken PVC pipe in the Meter box, easy to get to.  Well my Father was a plumber and I spent many years helping, so I know whats involved, this is a 15 minute, job 20 if you run into roots.  The guys showed up from Dutton in a nice new van, in pristine white shirts, carrying what looks like a doctors bag. I tried not to laugh out loud, wondering if they realized they were plumbers not doctors.  I told them they would not need all that its a simple pipe repair.   They then took about 10 mins to write up a estimate which was $816.00, but he was very proud that he was able to save me $134.00 and that's how he got it down to $816.00.  I told him he must be mistaken.  When he looked at me as if i was stupid I told him to take his fancy bag get back in his truck and get out of here.  That I am happy to pay a fair price but that was ridiculous and that I hope they don't rip everyone off in the same manner.

BTW Gordan Taylor Plumbing came out right away did the job in about 15 mins.  and I had him tend to a few other issues I had been meaning to fix like my R/O filter system under my sink, check my pressure regulator, test the pressure on the house, check a gas line to my fire pit. WOW I am sure when Dutton would add these other items I would have to take a loan out on the house to pay their bill.  BTW Gordon Taylor Plumbing did the whole job for under $200.00.

The odd thing is the guy from Dutton did not even seem surprised at my response I guess he hears it often.  I never got a call back trying to explain or appologize.  I realize companies are allowed to charge what they like, but at rates like that I am fearful for the people who don't know any better.  I had heard of a senior citizen who had them change a water heater for nearly $3,000.00 and I dismissed it as urban legend as that was just crazy pricing and who would pay such an amount, but now i must wonder if this was a myth.  I have been told their Plumbers work on a commissions.

I have used Dutton before and they were expensive, but this time they were crazy.  They have lost my business and have earned a special place as I will tell everyone of my experiences.  I wonder how many people they actually take advantage of like this.</Text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>I called in the morning for a leaky faucet repair and a garbage disposal replacement, a fair amount of business for one service call.  I was told it would be no problem to get someone out by 2:00 or 3:00.  I chose 3:00.  At 3:15, the office called and told me it would be a little longer, but they'd be here by 4:00.  At 4:20 they called and said it was going to be impossible to get some out today, but they would be happy to put on tomorrow's schedule.  I waited all day, cleaning up a leaky kitchen faucet, to be told they weren't coming.  Not good, Mr. Dutton!  They seemed "disappointed" that I was going to all another company,  Wow.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

We had a major water heater failure this morning so I searched the web for a firm to replace the failed one ASAP; Dutton Plumbing popped up first. I called and described the problem; Dutton promised to help ASAP and would call back soon. They did both and two techs arrived sooner than expected. They diagnosed the problem quickly, described options and immediately ordered a replacement. The new water heater was delivered within ninety minutes and in the meantime the Dutton techs removed the old one and prepared to receive and install the replacement. The whole job was done as rapidly as I could reasonably expect. The techs were professional and competent. We're pleased.</review>

They are a complete rip-off. Brought them in to fix a small leak on an exposed copper pipe. They replaced 9” and charged $510.00. Later on, they offered a no charge inspection of my sewer system. They came with an estimate of over $7000.00. When I asked for a complete report as to what is wrong with the current system supported by photos, they started to give me the round around. I will never use or recommend them. As evidence of the excessive profit, they make on people, They FDEX me a very expensive box of chocolate chip cookies. I rather be treated fairly then get cookies from them.< /review>
