<Text>Awesome staff. Very helpful and takes the time to answer all questions. I purchased my tires in Boise, ID at Discount Tire, and had no problems at all getting tire repaired at America’s Tire in Jackson, CA. (Same company).
Really satisfied. I would recommend.<//Text>< pics>

My tire shop of choice. Staff and management are top notch. I started going here not long after this location opened. I have all my family in the area going here. I moved over 5 hours away just over a year ago, but i still go here for my tires and get my rotations done when i am in town visiting family.<//text>

<review>Went in and gave the guys a rough idea of what I was looking for. They showed me all my options they had in stock, explained pricing, warranties, and gave me an itemized bill showing exactly what I was paying for and getting in return. Had four brand new tires balanced and on my truck in less than an hour despite a busy lobby. Extremely happy with the service.<//review>< resp>

Will never do business with this store again, I purchased a tire, will the addition addons they ask my name, number and email address, which I give then some one notifies, me that they received my receipt with my name address phone number my vehicles license plate number as well as the vehicles mileage, seem like a big screw up to me and as someone who enjoys privacy I will make a point of whenever someone asks for a recommendation, to repeat this and inform them that I would not trust them with any information whether it vehicle related or personal.< /review>

I was very impressed with the service at this shop.  I had to get new tires, and the sales consultation was not pushy or over bearing at all.  It was actually very helpful.  They spend time with you, not just try to sell you the most expensive tires.  They were done with the install in 20 minutes, on a Friday afternoon.  My SUV felt like a new vehicle when I drove it away.  Definitely recommend this store for tires!< /review>

I came in this morning for a flat, decided halfway through the repair to replace my tires. The guys were cool about it and had me in and out in the short window of time I had. I only buy tires from Americas Tire. Best customer service.</text>

I give this store 5 stars. They are very knowledgeable about tires. Do not go to any other place to get your tires. You will not be disappointed. The staff there go above and beyond the needs of the customer< /text>

Fast & efficient. I ordered my tires over the phone after browsing the selections on their website. Then made an appointment for them to install them. They were installed so quick I didn't have time to finish my coffee they have available.<//Text>

<review>After chasing other tire guys in martell to get a slow flat fixed for a month, I visited America's Tire for the first time. Joseph, Matt, and crew were the most professional guys I've dealt with.  Had two tires replaced and a 3rd fixed for free - in and out within the online appointment time. PS: That online appointment system is fantastic on the weekend when you need a tire on Sunday.< /review>< user_id>

<Text>I when to America's tire because my truck would vibrate under havey braking . Gibson Garage check out the brakes and I was told they were fine. America's Tire sold me the tires . I when to them at first they were not sure what they could do . I asked if they could do a run out balanceing . I was told all 4 tires were out of balance . They took care of me . The truck stops much better now.  I will continue to go to America's Tire .< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Worst customer service ever!! Was told 45 minutes to get 2 new tires! It's going on 2 hours and I'm still sitting here! People that have arrived after me, who have bought 4 tires have come and gone already! Two hours and van has sat in parking lot!!! Van is now in garage and it's been over an hour! I guess my $$ isn't as important as someone's that bought 4 tires!! No apology! No one has said a word to me as I've just sat here patiently waiting! Never again will I give them a dime of my money!< /text>< gmapID>

< review>
Inexperienced manager. He failed to understand the Corporate policy on tire installation. Filed complaint with America's/Discount Tire office. Took tires to a different location and had them installed no problem. Would not recommend this place until they get a new manager. They also wrongly stated my tire wear on tires I didn't ask them to replace, to create a need to sell me more tires. I have been a America's/Discount Tire customer since the early 80's. I will not use the location in Jackson anymore.</review>

I bought four new tires from this place and am now regretting it big time...  I have only had them for 10,000 miles and started to notice wear on the front tires... So today I took them in to get rotated and they tell me that I need to buy new tires!!! And that they will not rotate them for me even though it obviously needs it...  So if you want to buy new tires every 10,000 miles or less then this is the place for you! lol I have always gone to A & A tires in Sacramento and never had any problems.. I have pictures to prove everything I just said but dont know if I can post them with this review...< /text>

<review>Highly recommend this experience to anyone looking to enjoy the mountainous and oceanic views that SB has to offer. It took a while to get through on the # provided but keep calling! They are busy during this season but got back to me in a couple of days. Our trail guide Lucy was informative and very pleasant. Put the minds of two beginning riders at ease.</review><userid>109724001783232857917</userid>< Rating>

We took a wonderful scenic ride for an hour and a half with the tour guide Erica. It was peaceful and the horses were amazing. They had to reschedule our appointment to an earlier slot a few days in advance but it was totally fine. Highly recommend this experience with this company.</Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>We took a horseback ride for 90 minutes in Santa Barbara and had a wonderful experience. Elena was professional, on time, friendly and sweet. She was very good with the horses and the horses were very well trained. The ride was beautiful - we went down the trail from the mountains to the beach and out was serene and beautiful. Highly recommend Los Padres outfitters!!!< /review>< rating>

< review>
Tory was great and had great customer service and did everything in her power to accommodate our last minute ride with our guide Elena. Elena was our guide for the picnic beach ride for my birthday and she was amazing, very nice and very patient since we were first timers. The ride it self was beautiful and calm the picnic food was also amazing and they even let us take our own wine. Definitely recommend them for your horse back riding needs and we will definitely be going back!< /review>

We booked with Los Padres Outfitters for a bride's request riding on a horse at the beach to welcome her future husband. She was a bit nervous at the beginning but felt very comfortable after the introduction and getting to know the horse. What an emotional moment for our couple we will never forget.
All went perfectly and I can highly recommend Los Padres Outfitters for any event or your sunset ride on the beach. Thank you so much, for making the dream of our client came true.</review>

Me and my sister went for a beach ride with a wonderful guide Tori. I rode a sweet ol horse by the name of Blackjack. Tori was informative and fun- taking lots of pictures for us and telling us about the difference sites and the some of the history of the area. It was sunset on the beach and I felt so peaceful and connected to nature! Between the amazing scenery and the tid bits imparted to us by Tori, it was a truly memorable experience! Thank you Tori!!<//Review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>If you want to go riding in Summerland or on the beach, this is the way to go.  I have my own horse, and I often see the Los Padres Outfitters out on the trail, and being a horsewoman I am impressed with their horses and the experience they are offering to people who want to ride here.  When I wanted to ride with someone else, it was easily clear to me that the way to do it was to reserve a ride for both of us with the Los Padres Outfitters, and I was very pleased with our experience.  I'd definitely do it again, and I'd recommend them to anyone who would like to take a ride around here.  Wonderful people, and nice horses.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxYry5MgFVtf6S9S_kkp7wGBDM9JaR3nN-hxi4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80e90e909513d031:0xbb86f51961972210< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>We had a group of caregivers that care for their combat injured veterans go on this amazing horseback ride through beautiful scenery to include the hillside and along the beach. It was a wonderful experience for all! We had riders of all ages, and people that ranged from never having ridden a horse to experienced riders and everyone raved about how relaxing and special it was. The staff is friendly and professional and I highly recommend it!<//Text>< pics>

Graham and Boone and the other packers of Los Padres Outfitters are great guys and guides. They have packed our equipment and supplies into the Los Padres National Forest wilderness many times so that we could do our habitat restoration work. They were all good trips, even the hard ones, thanks to them. We at Channel Islands Restoration are most grateful.</review>

In March of 2019.
Our guide was awesome!  We met her@3pm. She led us up into the hills on the public trail where we had beautiful views of the hills and the ocean.    As we walked down toward the ocean, we passed beautiful homes and a polo field(where I later found out that my mom used to go there to watch polo matches when she was a nursing student at Santa Barbara City College).  We then walked down to the beach after crossing the hwy1 overpass.  We walked down the beach and got some nice pictures along the way.  This was my first visit back to Santa Barbara since I was born there in '67.  And to share that with my now 15 year old daughter was priceless.  (It was@ 2 to 3 hrs total)  Thank you❤< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Bucket List checklist!  Riding on the beach had long been a bucket list item for my wife.  She had grown up riding in the Midwest and the photographs of riding on the beach had teased her for decades.  When I discovered that Los Padres Outfitters could take her there, I was very excited to set it up.  Tony helped us find the right time and was very supportive of our special concerns as well as flexible when the odd weather event moved into the forecast.  Our rebooked day was a success and our trail guide tailored the experience just for us.   We have recommended the experience to others and plan to return for other rides.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I could tell she was confident in her abilities to assist me, knows the horses, the trails and gave short to the point instructions before we headed out.
There were four of us and Liz paired us all perfectly with the right horse just by asking a few questions about our background.
I had a marvelous time and enjoyed every minute of the ride from the beach to the trails. Thank you so much for a memorable morning. I highly recommend this to anyone  skilled or novice.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I planned my proposal here on one week notice and it was the best experience I could have ever asked for. The entire staff, Tony the amazing host who planned all of this, Elena our amazing trailhead and photographer, and Omar the incredible videographer were so loving and accommodating throughout the entire process. A beautiful ride through scenery capped off with riding on the beach during sunset and a picnic in the shore was the perfect way to pop the question to my fiancé. It’s the perfect place for any romantic getaway or just a day to clear your mind in beautiful nature.< /review>< pictures>

I treated my adult grandson and his girlfriend to a lovely beach ride at Summerland and I went along too.  I am 72 years old and felt very safe on their good trail horses.  we rode along some hills and between horse ranches and then down to padaro beach where we experienced the ocean and viewed gorgeous homes above the high tide line.  Padaro Beach is so charming and quiet with high cliffs and a rugged coast line.  this ride is so enjoyable and scenic and safe...a pleasure and thrill for all who partake.< /text>

We had a great time riding with Tori. She was very patient, a great instructor, made sure we were comfortable, and was a fun guide. I would say Tori is an integral part of Los Padres Outfitters who curated an amazing experience.< /Review>

My husband and I had the most wonderful trail ride today with Los Padres Outfitters!  We did a morning ride on Loon Beach with our guide Liz, and our horses Midnight, Gitano, and Howdy.  Our private ride catered to our more experienced riding abilities and we thoroughly enjoyed the beach, our friendly guide, and the sweet, gentle and willing horses.  Marilyn in the office was able to book us the day before and was very friendly and accommodating; pricing was actually better than other options in the area.  I love the down-home, genuine feel of this outfitter and will definitely visit again with other family and friends.< /Text>

Marilyn was more than accommodating to help me get on a trail ride. I was passing through and found out about their rides. It was always a dream of mine to take a horse on the beach, and she helped make that happen for me last minute. The trail ride was amazing- exactly what I was hoping for and more. My guide, Seth made the experience wonderful. He is good with people, knows the horses and how to ride well, and even took great pictures for me that are worthy of the living room mantle. I can tell these are good honest people that take good care of their animals. Thanks again guys! This experience really made my trip extra blessed and cheered me up when I needed it!< /review>

We love this place! Not only is the pie amazing (fruit pies, cream pies, so many pie options!) the soups and sandwiches and salad are fresh and delicious. We make a point to go at least once any time we are in or even driving by Cambria. They have a really cute outdoor garden area for dining as well as indoor. The outdoor area is dog friendly, which is convenient for us all to stretch out legs a bit.</Text>

Stopped in for some olallieberry pie based on other recommendations. Olallieberry is a blackberry/raspberry hybrid. The pie crust was flaky, but the filling was a bit too sweet for me. Worth stopping in...they have a few different fruit pies if olallieberry isn’t your taste. I think I will try the raspberry and rhubarb pie next time I’m in Cambria!< /Text>

<review>The best pie on the California coast. You won’t find any better. Linns pie has been around for an eternity and there’s a good reason for it. They’re awesome. There lemon meringue it’s just the beginning of assortments. Little hard to fine but look it up worth the trip< /review></record>

<Date>1612557470541</Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>We had the pecan pie, which was quite amazing (I’m from the pecan pie capital, Georgia, and I even thought it was one of the better pecan pies that I’ve had in my day). The shop and bakery were very cute and the worker was very friendly- they had some amazing pastries on display in the case as well. Our only qualm is that it was quite confusing to figure out where to buy just the pies to go. The building that says “Pies” on it is actually the restaurant, not this bakery/cafe- the actual cafe where you can purchase whole pies to-go is hidden behind a very large cactus a ways behind the aforementioned restaurant. The search is worth it though for this pie.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Must try pies! You don't get Olallieberry just anywhere, so if you stop in Cambria you must visit Linn's. Delightful menu for Breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Bakey has fresh items and coffee to go. And there's also a great gift shop with unique curios and edible treats. The wine selections are outstanding.< /Review><user_id>110956274380417438406</user_id>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Always delightful to stop in to Lynn. Today I had their twist on the Cuban sandwich. Roasted pork was outstanding the right amount of mustard provolone and Ham don't forget the pickles. Sandwiches put together great and the outside patio was beautiful. Receive the food in a very timely manner always fresh. Service was exceptional. And of course I had to have a fresh piece of pie.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHlboBr_lJkgDuSc94_xh4y5i6oYm48KC5VVyV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJHJQyHiFpckRd6Sv30sAjL1QQ80-snHA8fKfh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIvXFlvoCobI3jOu6U8jYc0M_H_uQWcd0TLkH0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpQ7G3G-kO4URKqZ0MRDSsJ4v8zkqoA2yzYpdF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwyukBU7OjXp1L6aLpzK8aHVokmabbT5U1Hp8b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm0bhxoAAnz2v3MyLMMy43yRGKJj1ejn4Ogd3w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL981xkthSCo_rt3gIjgTxj8fEB-MLkwhwlPTT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPNPLYzrLWRg6xXeGHrQizjwXGupafcMklk8yH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvOXF8TDuI-OFfQ3IYnzBMN743ps9kNtdzojUs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpY93woe9vkuTUiYFcldOlcNgziZqzjXTayHYa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>The best chicken pot pie I have ever had!! Definitely worth stopping and eating on the patio. COVID-19 protocols in place. Mask required, one way route to order and then exit to patio. Dog friendly patio is a plus. Highly recommend.<//review>< Rate>

Linn's is a fairly well known place in the area. We stopped there for a quick bite and ordered the chicken pot pie, asian chicken salad and the olallieberry pie with ice cream. The pieces of chicken in the pot pie were very large, however a bit dry for my taste. The flavor was very good in all the dishes, and the olallieberry pie and ice cream were amazing.<//text>

<review>Very tasty pies. They service is great, they warm everything up. The ambiance is interesting they have like a functional windmill and plenty of outdoor seating. Indoor seating is very rustic cafeteria style but they makeup with the food. The pies are awesome and a real local institution try the ollieberry, or the rhubarb.< /review>< UserId.>

<review>Small, casual restaurants with indoor and outdoor seating. We decided to visit this place for their pies and I'm so glad we did.  Aside from pies, they have a good selection of other types of wraps, paninis and sandwiches as well.  We ordered a BBQ tri-tip panini, a turkey wrap, a banana cream pie and old-fashion apple pie a la mode.  The food was delicious and we enjoyed the outdoor seating as well.  Prices were decent but, def worth it for the amount and quality of the food.< /review><Date>1531473866971<//Date>< pics>

DRIVE UP JUST FOR THE OLLALIABERRY TRUFFLES SERIOUSLY, IM GIVEN YOU A NUGGET OF GOLD MY FRIEND WHERE EVER YOU ARE PUT LINNS IN GOOGLE MAPS AND GO. ROAD TRIP 2021 A REAL GAME CHANGER TRUST ME....

Not too crowded. Good selection of pie and bakery goods.

<Text>We have been going to lens 4 / 30 plus years. It has been a great experience every time the food is nice and delicious. Over the years we have probably had six or seven anniversary and birthday dinners at Lynn's the service is great and the ambience is great. The one suggestion that I have 4 lens main store is for the service to tell the people about the cafe and the farm. Most of the people do not go that far down. The cafe has good food. The farm is a little out of the way but it is a nice drive to visit. They have a tree over there which is incredible. I'm going to post a couple of pictures and it's been my experience the size of this tree is unreal.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOq21tiiPEN-1rzbM8oppAg4EbFa85EBZzQSuFb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhdMbwQIQX6SEOB1WzsY1l0gMzKgMx4YbR52HO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< time>

We ordered 2 chicken pot pies that were served hot. Inside were chunks of chicken,veg and gravy. The crust was buttery and flaky. Delicious. We sat at an outside patio area that offered clean bathrooms (if you followed the chicken feet on the pathway! There was indoor eating as well. I purchase a jar of the $9.00 olaberry jam. Returned the following week-more chicken pot pies, more jams(for gifts)There are about 3Linn's. A full returant,a gift store, and the bakery-all within the same area. Nice place to hang out and stroll. Great olaberry pie for dessert and to take home-freshly made<//review>

<review>YUM! We've been on a road trip and we were craving for cake. I googled some pie cafes around and decided to stop at Linn's. They sell typical American pies with the specialty of Ollalieberry which I've never heard of before. It was fantastic.
After the pie, I went to the shops and bought some jam and presents. I was very well advised by the friendly lady who worked there. Thank you< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyY2OGrdmC_NAKS8AgoatozNHQHTt1KXPNRUet=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<review>Chicken pot pies were everything you could want.  Wonderful crust, plenty of chicken and veggies, and a delicious gravy.  The berry ice tea is delicious.   We sat outside since the weather was so nice.  The old tractor with the flowerpot driver was charming.  I particularly enjoyed the blooming hollyhocks. Overall a great experience.</review><GmapID>0x80ed302ad6aedc33:0x1cb294b1ebb3b5e4<//GmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< response>

Chicken Pot Pie (with emphasis on the chicken) and meatloaf were very good and the Olalieberry pie was perfect, not too sweet, not too tart. The crusts on my pies were browned more than I would have liked. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.</Text>

First let me start by saying that I did enjoy the food,  it was good..... But it wasn't good enough to warrant the prices they were asking it was difficult to find the little cafe (not hard)  just a minor annoyance,  there were no signs pointing you in the right direction.  Once I was at the cafe in was shocked at what they were charging,  12.95 for a pot pie no bigger than what you would get from the local grocery store,  a spoonful of mashed potatoes and a drink.... For my wife, my son and myself I spent close to 60 dollars.  Like I said at the beginning of this review it was good,  but the prices were not..... Unfortunately I probably won't be going back<//Text>

The meatloaf and mashed potatoes was some great comfort food followed by a warm slice of pecan pie and a cup of joe to pair with it. By far my favorite hidden nook to grab a post backpacking trip meal. I love this place and the people are so nice and welcoming.<//review>

We visited today and ordered the Chicken Berry Bleu salad. It was very good, and I loved the olallieberry dressing. The cashier was very rude though. When she handed us the pen to sign our receipt, she slammed it down on the counter. When my husband said “thank you!” after we had paid for our order, she said “yeah...” The food is also really expensive. It was $18 for one salad and one soda. Good food, but not good service or prices.<//Text>

Wanted a bite to eat and found this wonderful spot tucked away behind Linn's restaurant. Tempting baked goods made on site, comfort food like chicken pot pie and chowder. All meals are served on a pie tin super cute. Generous portions. Great out door patio seating available too.  I was told that local musicians entertain on the patio in the evenings. I will return very very soon.<//Text>

<review>I take friends here, because the patio is so charming, protected from the wind and quiet. There is unique music occasionally, and Chamber events. I can share a meal, and add a cup of veggie salad, delicious and fresh. Good chilli, too!</review>< Pics>

<review>Ate hear a little over a week ago, my god it was the best breakfast I've ever eaten. The Crabs Egg Benedict is the best thing the menu has to offer. Absolutely stunning presentation and the flavor is to die for.

Fiance had the French Toast with Laloberry(dont think I spelled that right) jam, and it was easily the best jam I've ever eaten.</review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<rate>3< /rate><text>Now the food was delicious at this lovely pie shop, however my review is 3 stars because the food was served on plastic cutlery which is simply not acceptable in the current environmental crisis. And it is simply not fair every meal served here to have an impact on the envirnment like that. So a simple lesson can be learnt by the owners of this cafe, either get a dishwasher or use paper cutlerly and plates.<//text>< date>

Olallie "berry" pie was filled with squishy sweet goop that had only 3 partial berries inside the crusts. The turkey sandwich meat had no discernible flavor. Won't go back!</Review>

<response>None< /response><review>I was very impressed with Linn's entire business operation in Cambria.   There's a regular restaurant, a casual cafe, two gift shops and a farm.   We ate at the cafe and enjoyed the outside eating area.   It was very relaxing.   The pot pie was excellent.   It was really fun to browse through the two gift shops.   I wish we had had time to visit the farm.  We didnt try the pies but had a cinnamon roll.   Excellent.  I would definitely recommend Linn's.<//review>< username>

<text>This little pie shop feels like walking into a 1950s movie - it's charming, authentic and the pies are as fantastic as you'd expect them to be. Attention coffee lovers: they have a serious espresso machine and make really good cappuccinos and lattes!</text>< Name>

You're not going to drive through Cambria without stopping for pie at Linn's Berry Farm. Well, this is the easier-to-get-into/easier-to-get-out-of no BS version of their famous restaurant.<//Text>

What can I say about Linns other then the best pot pie I've ever had! Also dont miss the banana cream pie or the lemon meringue tart...WOW... Linns has several different options...they have the sit down restaurant and around the corner they have a store where you can buy Linns frozen food products for shipment or to take home with you but my favorite is the Easy as Pie location which is a cute little take out type restaurant, they have other food options but not sure why you would get anything other than PIE when coming to Linns!</review>

I tried this place because of the good reviews. I ordered a tri-tip paninni, and sat down at a table. There were 3 staff working with very few orders, but my order took about 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen. I enjoy my sandwiches at home more than I enjoyed this one.
Thought about having a piece of pie, but at $6 a slice for 1/6 of a pie, I decided not to. Honestly, I wish I had tried Cambria Grill.</text>

What a pleasure their cafe is! I had a decent cappuccino and a delicious olallieberry pie while working on a project during a recent trip through Cambria. Their cafe has free WiFi and is setup well for working on a computer or relaxing with a book. The price was a touch high for the cappuccino, but it was decent and paired well with the pie. Looking forward to snacking and reading here again!<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Pies very tasty. Advice but not available and even with little operation rather hectic clearance.

Pies sehr lecker. Beratung aber nicht vorhanden und auch bei wenig Betrieb eher hektische Abfertigung.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Cute little shop. He has two seats, so two locations next to each other. Exceptional service. More like a grandma cake 😉 but made sweet. Cakes are typically American.

(Original)
Schnuckeliger, kleiner Laden. Der zwei Sitze hat, also zwei Lokalitäten nebeneinander. Außergewöhnliche Bedienung. Eher ein Omi-Kuchen-Lokal 😉 aber süß gemacht. Kuchen sind typisch amerikanisch.< /Text>

We’ve been patients for 8 years and can’t say enough positive things about the office, its staff and our results. The office is well-run with a very courteous staff. Dr. Styrt is attentive and knowledgeable, providing additional detail behind your treatment plans and care instructions. The pride this office takes in helping each patient is evident in every appointment. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great orthodontist - for both themselves or for their children.<//Text>

<review>I have always been so impressed with Dr. Styrt and his staff. The office is beautiful but most importantly are the people. They have always made me feel like family, they are so welcoming and everyone is so knowledgeable. Thank you for the fun during my journey!<//review>< name>

Amazing experience with Dr. Stryrt.  Everyone was so kind and amazing.  They explained the process and let me know exactly how things would go.  I felt and peace about my decision to change the look of my teeth.</review>

My family comes to this office and every time my kids leave so happy, it's a great feeling to have such a fun and caring office to bring my family to and to teach my kids good habits of going to the dentist, this office makes that so easy!<//Text>

I was referred to Dr Styrt. He came highly recommended. I recently had a consultation with him. Beautiful office, and wonderful staff. I felt very welcomed by everyone. Dr Styrt listened to all of my concerns, and reassured me that we can achieve the results I want. He is very kind. Gina explained the process really well, and was very warm and friendly. Overall all I had a great experience.</Text>

<text>Great staff, very personable. The entire staff and Dr. Styrt went out of their way to make me comfortable after explaining my concerns about going through Orthodontic work as an adult.  Gina is the best and was very patient with me as I asked questions. No waiting after arriving, safe office  protocols are in place. All my questions and concerns were handled efficiently. I highly recommend Dr. Styrt's Orthodontic practice.< /text><date>1619970406202</date>< rating>

Great place, wonderfully nice staff. Went in for my first visit and their precautionary measures to ensure staff and patient safety during this Covid nightmare was awesome. They really made you feel welcome. The office is kept neatly and clean. Dr. Styrt really took the time to explain everything in detail and really looked out for your best interest and provided suggestions as an expert dentist. I would highly recommend this place.< /Text>

<name>Jim Walery<//name><date>1615017946160< /date><review>Unfortunately, I had a very poor experience with Dr. Stryt.

He pushes braces or Invisalign on you even if you don’t need them. You pay top-tier pricing to only be disappointed in the service and quality of care you receive. My appointments felt rushed and anytime I paused to ask a question, he seemed annoyed. He also gave me really poor advice when it came to nightly retainers and the type to use... of course he made me opt for the most expensive one.

Some of these 5 star reviews seems a little suspicious and similarly written?</review><resp>None</resp>< UserId.>

I am currently still in treatment but I just wanted to say that I am very grateful for Dr. Styrt as well as Collette, Patty, and the rest of the staff. I came in needing a lot of work after a very unfortunate injury caused by another dentist, and it has been a very long road to recovery. I was in tremendous chronic pain and had seen a variety of different specialists who didn’t know how to help me. I was later finally diagnosed with trigeminal neuropathy. Slowly but surely, I have been healing and and am in significantly less pain than when I started treatment. With the help of Invisalign by Dr. Styrt, followed by restorative work by a prosthodontist, I am actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel now and have hope that my chronic pain will go away completely and I will be able to have my normal, happy life back again. Thank you.<//Text>

<Text>Both my kids have been going to Dr. Styrt for their orthodontia. He was referred to me by my long time dentist and we couldn’t be happier. His office is always friendly and attentive and they are great about scheduling last-minute appointments. I trust the treatment plans and love that he’s a true perfectionist when it comes to creating beautiful smiles.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Wonderful people and wonderful service. When I first began coming at a young age I was scared of the dentist from going to previous companies, but their wonderful staff quickly changed my mind. I couldn’t imagine better care.< /review>

<Review>Dr Styrt is a fantastic Orthodontist! I have been a patient of his for over six month - he is correcting teeth that have shifted (since I had braces 25 years ago), clenching my teeth and other issues - all through Invisalign. My two daughters (ages 8 and 10) are also being treated by Dr Styrt with Invisalign. I had initially taken them to a few other Orthodontists for opinions and I found Dr Styrt to be the best! His experience, high attention to detail, education and perfectionism is evident. He noticed things that other Orthodontists didn’t notice (and that were an issue). His staff is also very professional, friendly and personable and my girls enjoy going for their check ups. I have been very impressed with their COVID protocols and how they go the extra mile to keep the patients safe. I am thrilled that we chose Dr Styrt and I highly recommend him (and I’m very picky and have very high expectations)!</Review><userid>106657275512258038427< /userid><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc072e6d6526af:0xfe3691557b1571bf<//gmap_id><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

<Review>I visited Dr. Styrt for a consultation. His office staff was warm, welcoming,  and professional. The work stations were clean and well organized. The office is beautifully decorated and every window has fantastic planter boxes.

For my consultation, Dr. Styrt staff took photos and a full mouth x-ray in order to give me a thorough analysis of my teeth. He then listened carefully to the issues I was having and he offered several treatment options. Dr. Styrt spent a lot of time with me and answered all of my questions.

Thank you Dr. Styrt and team!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The level of customer service far exceeded our expectations.  From the front desk to management to Dr.  Styrt it was amazingly friendly and comforting.  My favorite part of the visit was the amount of time spent to thoroughly explain our treatment and options.  No question was left unanswered.  Will be returning for dental treatment<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I had an excellent experience at Dr Styrt’s office thus far. The staff was welcoming and the facility was beautiful. I had a consultation visit, both Dr. Styrt and Gina was knowledgeable and honest about what I needed to have done. I was given information on the procedure and was given plenty of opportunities to ask questions about what I didn’t understand. They were honest with cost and willing to work with me so that I can afford the payments. There was definitely no feeling of pressure to sign up for the procedure which I loved. Thank you to the entire staff for being so friendly.< /Text>< Pics>

Thanks to Dr. Styrt and his staff, my boys, ages 9 and 11, love visiting the dentist and orthodontist! We have been long time patients since my older son was 1 year old. Dr. Styrt takes the time to explain the phases of orthodontic procedures to me, the parent, as well as my kids. I love that he takes into consideration the child's personality and maturity level when making decisions on the best treatment procedures. Highly recommended orthodontist and pediatric dentistry office!!</review>

<text>Good people, happy place, great orthodontist. Everything about this office is near perfect. From the ambience of the space to the warmth of the employees, you will almost not want to leave. Besides the welcoming environment, you will also get the feeling that you are in good hands from the clear (and nuanced if you want) explanation they provide you about your personal situation, your options, and what the process would be like from start to finish. All in all, I'm glad with my choice of Dr Styrt and would recommend this office in a heartbeat.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We were very impressed by Dr. Styrt and his staff. The office is impressively appointed and immaculately maintained. Dr. Styrt and Gina, the Treatment Coordinator, thoughtfully performed a comprehensive examination of my son's teeth and medical history before providing us with a clear and thorough explanation of his treatment options and their course recommendations. We were pleasantly surprised to find that although his office in located in a very affluent area and his office is strikingly posh, Dr. Styrt's prices were remarkably competitive.<//text>

<review>The staff and experience for my son was unparalleled. Truly, they more than met my expectations and my son (4 years old) isn’t afraid of the dentist. I can’t say the same for when I was a kid. These guys have taken dentistry to the next level and provide an exceptional service as well.</review>< pics>

<Review>Dr. Styrt has done an amazing job with my son whom just got his braces off today. The entire team there (particularly the very sweet Collette) and the very sweet girls at the reception, made us feel welcomed and comfortable through the entire process. Now my second son is starting the whole journey to braces and we know what to expect due to the excellent customer service  already experienced. I would recommend Dr. Styrt and his team to anyone.
Thank you!  The Chapman’s.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1556830777202, 'text': 'Melissa, thank you so much for such a wonderful review!

I was very happy with my consultation for Invisalign. The staff was wonderful, especially Gina, and Dr. Styrt took his time to examine my teeth and provide a detailed plan of action for the Invisalign. I've done several consultations and this one was the best by far. While I haven't decided if I want to do Invisalign yet, I will for sure be going with Dr. Styrt and his team if I do decide to get my teeth straightened.</Review>

Dr. Stryt’s office is by far my favorite dental and orthodontist for my children. Ranging in ages from 5-11, they have a positive experience every time! From the front office, dental assistance, dentists, and orthodontist, they have all been kind, friendly, and professional. They have a welcoming environment and a kid friendly space that my littles enjoy. You couldn’t ask for more when searching for a pediatric dentist or orthodontist!</text>

Do you want excellent care and a fantastic smile? If so, you're in for a high-quality result with Dr. Styrt and Associates! Do yourself a favor and bring your whole family here. Dr. Styrt and his whole team are excellent! He'll even give you those gentle reminders when you're off track. After having gone through invisalign and traditional metal braces with him in the early 2000s, I was so pleased with the results and the excellent care, I returned (as a second timer) for another round of invisalign due to a relapse... REMEMBER TO WEAR YOUR RETAINERS! From the front desk, to the back office, everyone is great and goes above and beyond to complete the treatment or just be friendly.

At any rate 6/5 stars, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<//Text>

Great place to go for any Othodontic work. Dr Styrt and his staff are a wonderful team. The place itself is located in the beautiful green glass building at 9339 Genessee Ave. It's decorated in the most adorable way, toys and colorful plants and  pictures. It's like a secret garden. It has a beautiful energy . The younger patients all appear very happy and Dr. Styrt chats with them on a real natural way, as does everyone! I'm an older patient and had to go there in an emergency. Other Dentists turned me away. Not only did I get my problem sorted but I decided to do Invisalign.
Looking forward to the future, so far so good !😃😆< /Text>

Dr Paul Styrt and his team are Excellent., the best by far, from interviewing with other orthodontists.

Starting with my daughter, years ago, I interviewed a few doctors to fix the overbite and two high up "fang" teeth.  The orthodontists said they cannot completely fix everything.  When Dr. Styrt said yes, he could, I asked for evidence, and sure enough I saw pictures of before and after.  (no teeth taken out for her correction).  Now before and after pictures can be seen on his website.  Dr. Styrt fixed completely and beautifully everything for my daughter, and included some free stuff.

Now, I needed to fix my overbite and some crooked teeth, because of grinding wearing them down.  I talked to some orthodontists from reputable places, and said that I am too old, and cannot completely fix my overbite.  Sure enough Dr. Styrt could.

All the people in the office are warm, and taking the time to give a wonderful personalized experience, from the intake on.

The place is very nice, calm, and inviting.  There are always some fun games with prizes, for everyone.   All of this, makes for an awesome experience going to the orthodontics.

Sr Styrt also have reserved parking, in the busy structure, so you do not have to look for parking.</text>< Time>

<review>Zero Stars. The other negative reviews are right. Dr. Paul Styrt does unnecessary procedures to make money. Dr. Styrt is a money-hungry, unprofessional and incompetent orthodontist who amputates his patients and ruins smiles. He pretends to be nice in the beginning to trick you and get your money. Don't be fooled by his fake veneer. If you want to be abused and degraded, go to him. It will be the biggest mistake of your life. You and your children will never recover from Dr. Styrt’s unnecessary and damaging procedures and his constant mistakes. You will be traumatized for life.

We will never recover from the permanent and irreparable damage he caused. By the way, if you do not see all of his negative reviews, he has them removed and he pretends you were never his patient.

Horrible Orthodontist!

Response: Like I said before, Dr. Styrt pretends you were never his patient! What a convenient response! We already called him and he didn't care about the damage he caused.<//review><username>John A.<//username>< time>

Dr. Paul Styrt Orthadontist makes me feel at home. When I started in 5th grade, I was very scared to get braces for the first time. I was able to overcome my fear thanks to Dr. Styrt. Thank you Dina, you were the one who took care of the steel in my mouth. I hope this place will soon become a worldwide sensation!😁❤<//Review>

<Text>My enamel is gone for good on my teeth. He placed the wrong product on my bottom teeth to stop my grinding while I was in braces, and it wore away the enamel on my top teeth. When I confronted him, he admitted fault and then never paid for the restoration I had to have done. To top it off, he never reimbursed me for the remainder of my contract either. This guy is a shyster who cares only about money and not about patients. Don't be fooled by the video games and freebies; it's all just a ploy to get you in his chair where he spends less than a minute on you and can't even remember your name. Please look for a peer review orthodontist who reviews guys like this; they are honest -not like Styrt. He's just in it for the money!!!</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc072e6d6526af:0xfe3691557b1571bf</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I came to Dr. Styrts office because a crown that changed by bite had pushed some of my teeth into a corner causing me contant pain. I needed top notch help for my bite because of the constant pain. Dr. Styrt was able to carefully evaluate my bite and make me a retainer quickly to relieve my pain within a short time by moving my teeth just a little in places to relieve the pressure. Dr Styrt is the best at what he does. When I was able to afford it, in payments, I was able get my bite completely and meticulously fixed to perfection! Now I have a pain free and perfect smile. Thanks Dr. Styrt!<//text>

I've had waaaay worse and if 3½ Stars had been an option, then that's how I would've opted. If the owners haven't been lying to me the past six years I've been frequenting this quaint little, well, Corner Cafe (which is the first anything you're gonna be able to describe as "quaint" this close to Ye Olde Skid Row)then they're brothers of Eastern European decent who've hired the right people to<//Text>

<Text>I don't know how it is during daytime, but night time is pretty iffy. Found myself here after a night of happy hours. This place has a small lot for your car, but once you leave the warmth of your car...this ain't Kansas anymore, Toto. All seating is outdoors. It's also right next to the sidewalk, so you will encounter all walks of life if you choose to dine-in. I'm not gonna fault the place for that, but just be prepared to be asked for change a couple times. Other than that, this place is open late and smells great (the food, not the....nevermind..).

-=-Carne Asada Burrito-=- Nothing juicy about the meat, and also nothing to write home about. It was pretty flimsy to hold up, so it just wasn't packed the way other places pack and stuff a burrito. Rice came out in chunks, and the meat was few between. That's about all I can report from this place. Did I mention that I just had a night of happy hours?< /Text>< Rating>

This place is literally the worst burger spot I ever ate at. It's no wonder why it's located in skid roll. I can't believe they charged me $7 for that disgusting cheese burger combo. It looked like the free food they pass out to homeless people. I definitely will never in my life go back to this dump.</Review>

<Review>When the people ahead of me tried to pay with thier card suddenly the system was down. She gave them thier 25 order for free since the sandwiches were made. My sandwich  was also made but she told me I had to go to the bank at the end of the strip mall and get cash to pay for my sandwich. I told her I wasn't going to go payb5 bank fees for a 10 sandwich unless they were going to deduct that from the price of my sandwich. She stated she could not do that. I told her then she might as well eat it herself. I will never dine here again.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>If I could rate this place 0 stars then I would! the lady who did my sandwich today  was clearly not in the mood and was upset. Very rude staff and didn’t even make the sandwich how I wanted it especially since I’m paying 10+ for a sandwich.  I won’t be coming back here again.<//text></record>

<text>If I could give this place a 0 star I would. Drove across town with my family of 4 to find out they closed early because they ran out of bread!! I got here at 5:30 the doors where locked. I figured they were locked due to COVID-19. (Which they have no signs posted in there windows) so I called and I asked if I could place an order. Oh I’m sorry we closed early because we ran out of bread. 3 other cars pulled up to find out the same thing.< /text>< Resp>

< Review>
I love the food here and the service is usually excellent. Just today, I went in to pick up an online order on my way my home from work my fiance put in. I asked them if he had bought chips and the woman said no, have a good day, and I left. We just sat down to eat 2 hours later and yes, he did buy chips. My reciept wasn't in the bag, but he pulled up the confirmation email and he paid for chips. That's $4 down the drain. Definitely going to question them from now on.</Review>

<review>Good food. Staff is always friendly.
It's too bad the parking lot is a mad house at lunchtime. Security guards for the other shops will stop you from parking if you are not shopping there. Other drivers could care less if you just saved their life, they will cut you off in a heartbeat!!!<//review><rating>4<//rating><resp>None<//resp><userid>113746582523349890289<//userid></record>

Today was my first experience with Mr. Pickles anywhere and we were  in Manteca Calif.  and I was quite surprised a definite noche up from subway or Togo’s.  First I was able to have my sandwich on bread choice or rolls and I chose marbled Rye which was so fluffy and fresh.  We live near the Castro Valley one and have never stopped but gone by it so today out of town we tried one I can not recommend it any higher than I am you too will be surprised like us.  Service excellent and the freshest sandwich I have had in a long time and The Tuna was excellent.</text>

Just to let you know I don't eat everybody's tuna but their is real good, and talking about good pastrami.  Their's is the best I've had. Other places I would name has too much fat and not enough meat.

You can tell the staff all love their jobs because they remember the people they see around and are always kind. Every last one of em deserve a raise..  Just sayin<//Text>< pics>

Flavorless, the only thing that stood out was the bell pepper. I asked for garlic sauce and mustard didn’t have either on my sandwich. Unfortunately I got it to go. For a sandwich shop named Mr. Pickles I would have expected more than two on my sandwich.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Has very friendly employees and quick service.  Was in there when a rude lady stared complaining  about call in an order 5 minutes before closing.  She was so nasty to the young employees I wanted to put my fist in her mouth to shut her up.  When she came in she expected 6 free sandwiches.  I would he told the to go to subway and would have given her $20.00 just to leave.  Customer service isn't an easy job.  I pray that the lady comes back reincarnated as a mouse and she gets snagged on a glue trap.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8090419fdc1ad931:0x7087362df389d767</GmapID></record>

Cannot say enough about the organic fair trade coffee single origins and blends. The staff is happy and know their brews. They offer careful pour overs for just the right dilution. They have specialty drinks and treats and cater to needs for oat, almond, cream and milk. Go for the Double Dark my friends and you'll be glad you did.<//text>

If you like a chocolate espresso roast give them a try. Best coffee in the area, should you ask us. As of this writing they have a new location in Paso Robles, which is every bit as good, but surrounded by other high quality choice shops: bakery, sandwich I think. The outside venue offers perfect landscaping for the little ones to run around. The Atascadero location is quiet, however, maybe hard to find, but a hidden gem if you’re into that kind of thing. Best espresso and consistently good coffee; they’re my recommendation to all friends and family passing through the area.</Review>

<text>We LOVE Jobella Coffee Roaster!  We travel often up and down the West Coast and Hawaii, and Jobella’s coffee is by far the best!  My favorite roast is Bella Vida - Wowza!  You can get Bella Vida in both regular and decaf, amazing, smooth, delicious coffee.   You must try it!!  They will ship coffee to you; order online or call the store.

When we are at the Kona, Big Island  coffee farms, we always look at each other and say.... not as good as Jobella’s!

When we are in Alaska, they ship my Bella Vida whole bean coffee to me and it arrives quicker than anything else I have ever shipped to Alaska!

Jobella has Great coffee, friendly owners, professional baristas.

Thank you Jobella for roasting and creating Bella Vida 💕< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Great coffee of course, roasted on site with many varieties available for purchase or just enjoy a delicious cup of coffee in a friendly and comfy atmosphere. We go whenever we need more coffee at home and relax with a fresh brew with our dog at the outside tables. Nice place to stop for a cuppa when in the area too.</Review><gmapID>0x80ecdcad9114849b:0xb352c5e9bce96d2f< /gmapID>< rate>

<Text>We've been going to Jobella in Atascadero for several years now. I first tasted their wonderful coffee at an event at Spencer's Fresh Market when there was a store in Arroyo Grande.   Since then, we've bought the beans from time to time. When we get to Atascadero we've always stopped for coffee but what really has us hooked is the blended Mexican mocha. Jobella's blended drinks are by far the best and have spoiled us for the green apron drinks. These blended drinks are creamy and smooth, perfect consistency every time we order one. The flavor is absolutely the best. Plenty of espresso taste and the perfect amount of cinnamon to enhance the chocolate without overpowering everything else. Whenever we're in Atascadero we stop for one. It's a disappointment if we come through town when they're closed.

Service is exceptional. Our favorite barista, and the woman who introduced us to the Mexican mocha, is no longer there, but the staff is always cheerful and responsive. I'm sure we'll be going to Jobellas for a long time.< /Text><userid>114241157198109668435<//userid>< pics>

BEST COFFEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.  Fast efficient service for both coffee and food.  If you drink real espresso coffee and don't add a bunch of flavors and additives to cover up the taste this is the place to go, rich strong and flavorful with no bitterness.  Burrito tasty and muffins home made and delicious.</Review>

Always serving great coffee, and pastries (and small burritos). The staff is very polite, and Joe the owner is sometimes there. He is very kind, and interested in your day. Yes, it's also very cozy, clean, has a bathroom, and they sell coffee beans by the pound. They roast a great decaf coffee.<//Review>

< Review>
Great seriously good coffee. relaxed non corporate reasonably priced with 1$$ refills. The darkest med roast Guatemala I have had. The dark chice of double dark was too much dark flavored for even me. I was hoping for active roasting activities for heavy aroma that is my obly unmet wish. Drove 4 miles past other places and worth the drive<//Review>

The roasters and baristas at jobella are on par with some of the states best. There passion for the roasted bean is evident in everything they make. The baristas are intimately knowledgeable of all the products. Atascadero has a gem that needs to be celebrated<//review>

Food was edible..but barely. Not much flavor at all on the burger. Fries and slaw was pedestrian..coffee strong. Prices reasonable for what you get. Not a memorable culinary event here folks. ...it wont kill you.</review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>If you wish for comfort foods, then this spot is for you. All of the typical American “dinner” items are available. The omelettes are all good. I have tried their vegetarian omelette and it has a decent amount of veggies. The sides are ample with choices of potatoes and pancakes. The sandwiches are well made but could use a little something to kick them up a notch or two. I have taken away one star because of the coffee. The coffee, perhaps is of a lower quality or not brewed properly. It always tastes sort of flat or slightly pungent. Maybe it’s just me. Otherwise I like this spot for a relaxed meal and the service is fast, efficient and friendly.< /text>< Pictures>

Good place to have brunch in San Mateo. Easy and convenient
parking. The menu has a lot of dishes to choose from. You have the typical brunch omelette, burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc. The service was very attentive, and the prices are fair. There was not waiting when we were there, in a Saturday afternoon.<//review>

<Review>Cockroach nightmare: We live close to Neal’s and so, at the end of this summer, our family decided that we would support our local diner by having breakfast here every Saturday. We have had breakfast here for the last month. It’s never been anything spectacular but it was good enough and our girls liked it. Unfortunately, everything changed today. Our girls ordered a chocolate milk and their regular breakfast of pancakes and eggs. We were almost done with breakfast when my oldest daughter, who was drinking her milk, felt something in her mouth as she sipped from her straw. She took out what was in her mouth and it was a small cockroach!!! When she saw it she threw it on the plate and started spitting like crazy (see attached picture to see what was in her mouth). I still can’t get over the thought that my daughter basically drank her whole milk and that had probably been sitting in there from the beginning. The waiter was very apologetic and took the plate away immediately. Unfortunately management was no where to be found, and while we got half the meal off, I think that’s definitely not enough. Our family, my daughter specially, will have that memory for the rest of her life and if we were different type of people, we could escalate this even more. Needless to say, we will never be going back there and if you go, I’d say check your food and drinks before you start eating!</Review>< user_name>

<Text>Great little breakfast lunch place with great comfort food with a Mexican bent. Chorizo scramble is fantastic, as are their fish tacos (done with grilled trout instead of cod, so awesome – much more healthy and better tasting.) Home made salsa and their black bean side is off the hook. Perfectly spiced, savory and flavorful. Great sandwiches and decent kids menu. Prices are mid range (but cheap for CA folks who are used to Bay Area price gouging. 🙄) but entirely worth the price. Portions are ample and filling, without being Cheesecake Factory obscene.

Staff is friendly and attentive, and very willing to accommodate if you have dietary needs or requests (that you can't find on the pretty large menu selection – it's really comprehensive!) Bright, naturally lit space, and not too terribly loud (but can get that way when they are slammed, just fyi if you really prefer quiet places). We take our kids here after Japanese school and it always kicks off a lovely afternoon. Highly recommend.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

$8.45 Breakfast Specials, Monday to Friday, 6am to 11am (except holidays). Great for breakfast or brunch.  Most tables are inside, but a few tables are outside on the side.<//review>

Neal's knows what it is:  a coffee shop.   Food is good,  generous portions, satisfying but not "foodie" quality.  Great for breakfast in the late afternoon, good burgers,nice staff.  Straight forward, no pretence, good basic meals.< /Text>

Consistently good food and service, but even with air conditioner, they had door open and the place was swarmed by flies;
a onstant battle.  The flies were on unoccupied table utensils and condiments.  Gross.</Review>

I have one thing to say about this place. Get the steak sandwich. Or anything with steak for that matter. Of course this place has a very extensive menu complete with low cal options and vegetarian meals. And nothing is salted for the cholesterol fearing folk. But seriously. Steak. Cows BEG to taken here so their sacrifice is worthy.< /Review>

<review>This place is my favorite coffee shop! They make great breakfast and a very good lunch and dinner also. Their prices are low and the quality is high. And to top it off the service is top rate. I don't think many places deserve a five star rating but Neal"s definitely earns one!< /review>< name>

Just bad cooking all the way around. My first visit I had a burger which appeared to be a Costco frozen patty. I decided to give them another chance and was served parboiled pork chops and bland watery gravy. I won't be back.<//text>

Good coffee, friendly service, delicious hash brown, but mediocre food. French dip consisted of one medium-thick slice of industrial roast beef drearily between slice of soft bun and already made consomme. Patty melt had processed swiss cheese and  drab of sauerkraut. French fries were thick and tasteless. Ingredients are not really restaurant made, but maybe the breakfasts are their signature dishes? Plenty of customers who are obviously hungry!< /text>

<rate>5<//rate>< review>
This place is owned by the same folks as the one in Burlingame. The food and service is equally good, though this one is a little cleaner. I like the open kitchen layout since you can see how they cook things up. Their breakfast is the best in the mid peninsula area in my opinion. Everything is delicious. I ordered the corned beef hash and i don't think I've had it better anywhere else. We used to go to Bucks at Woodside, and in comparison with Neal's it is so overrated and overpriced. Neal's= good food, good service, good value. Highly recommended.</review>

< Review>
As much as life throws at me, I admit that I enjoy the simple things in life and Neal's is one of them. Another simplicity I appreciate is a brunch. It combines my favorite meals of the day -- breakfast --lunch-- with dranks, which is another activity that I happen to love.

As far as breakfast foods go, there isn't necessarily one that I like more than others, but if I absolutely had to choose a favorite it would probably be Eggs Benedict or good ol fashion pancakes. Blueberry silver dollar pancakes were on my radar that day and the great thing about silver dollar pancakes is that you can have 5-6 of them not really feel like a pig in the process of scarfing them down. Do you want to know something better than mini sized pancakes? Mini sized pancakes in the shape of Mickey Mouse. They told me since it was my first time I had the pleasure in devouring mouse shaped pancakes. I'm pretty sure by the look of the Yelp photos that they do this to every order but who cares you made me feel special. Keep the compliments coming and I'll make it rain more then Miley Cyrus at a strip club. OK I over exaggerated that but with service on top of their game they deserve it!

Sure the food may not be Instagram worthy and the ingredients aren't imported from Portugal served upon golden encrusted plates and silverware but if you want something that fills you up without breaking your wallet Neal's definitely does the job.</Review>

<Review>Great service, the salon is very nice and pleasant. The personnel is great ! The choice of color is very large.
I loved the manicure they made me, it looked so pretty and they really took the time and effort to fix back some of my broken nails.
I fois have given 5 stars if the timing of the appointment was respected ;-)< /Review></record>

I asked for a pedicure, but the lady who did the service recommended another one (with the message, more expensive), I accepted. Later, when it's finished, my feet were not clean, still a lot of dead skin! First time got a result like this! You know what, the lady told me if you want clean skin, do another expensive one! I went to a lot of nail stores for a pedicure as weekly routine, every time I got clean skins on my feet. Unbelievable! They just want you to spend more money! Now I don't like this store and I have to go to another store to complete pedicure!</review>

I  moved my job to downtown and not come to the salon very often since then but in recently dropped in the salon for my Gel nails, pedicure and waxing services to attend a wedding. The services was very good and my gels still last for almost a month without a chip or crack. The deluxe pedicure was the best. All callus patches were removed and the feet were pampered with facial mask. The waxing services were also very good. I always have the best brow shape. It's still my favorite salon.</Text>

I always feel very welcomed at this salon. The employees are friendly and the work is well done. They are also supportive of the local community and schools. Thanks Rivermark Nails!<//Review>

My review is solely based on the sanitary practices this nail salon has. I was super taken back by a couple things. First, the nail technician had me sit down at her station WITHOUT replacing the used paper towel (used as a mat for nail shavings, etc.) from a previous customer. Gross! Second, and probably more disgusting than the first incident,  I noticed shortly afterward that she was pulling the drill endings from a tin titled "Soiled." What?! How disgusting! Makes me wonder how long she had been using those drills before she cleaned them and used them on another customer. On top of that, she cut me with the drill because she was sloppy with it and the skin around the cut is very red and sore. And after she cut me, she wasn't gentle with the nail file either. I am keeping an eye on it and hoping it doesn't get infected. They deserve the 1 star rating because this was my second visit with them and my 1st visit was awful due to the nail tech being rude and seemed bothered and annoyed by doing her job. I am sure not all of the nail techs are like this there, but I didn't have a great experience with 2 of them so i cant speak for everyone else. Just avoid this place and go somewhere else!<//text>

I wish i could give no stars to these people. bad service and my nails looked terrible. A 2 year old could've done a better job. They reuse their sterilizing pouch for God knows how many times. seal it and dont reuse them please! The pouch should be sealed when they bring it out to you. please be careful.</review>

Horrible experience. I went there to get off my gel nail polish and they just shortened my nails like nothing that too with a file. I would not have come here if I had to get the polish off by shortening the nails. I would have rather  just used a nail cutter. The lady files my nails all the way till my skin. Also she did the massage without having my hand washed off after the heavy filing. So essentially my pores got clogged with all the nail dust. The staff was rude and also did not finish my nails before applying the nail polish. I would recommend no one very should go there and have an experience that would ruin your nails.<//Text>

** I typically don't write reviews**

I would not recommend this nail salon, I have been giving them a "chance" for the last 6 months since it's in a convenient location. They are very expensive for what they offer, they don't have any massage chairs and force you to spend at least $20.00 to utilize your credit card. They also won't allow you to use your tip to meet the $20 min.

I understand vendors get charged a small fee, however I feel that if you have a customer who comes in often you should be able to wave this if they just need a eyebrow waxing for example when they spend $65 dollars on the service a week ago.

They also get very busy and will start your service then start someone else, if you are looking for a local nail salon who will provide you great service and not charge your a fortune this is not it.

Finally, they charge you for the shellac nail removal when you are getting it put back on. -- Maybe this is normal, however I went to the same nail salon for 7 years before relocating and I was never charged for this.

They are in a great location and have the opportunity to have very satisfied customers , not just customers who return for its " convenience factor" as I have heard so many times while in the salon.

Hopefully, they take this review to heart and make some changes.<//review>

I have been coming here for 10 years. Very convenient from where I lived. I tried a few other places near my work by it s just not as good.
Kim and Heidi do a great job on nails.
Anna and Tracy are wonderful on toe nails. Mai as well!!!!
I am always happy with the way my nails/ wax look
They can be very busy at times, so I usually will call ahead or make an appt.
I have read some of the negative reviews and as I respect them, this is not the experience I have.
They do speak Vietnamese amongst each other, but then I do speak French around French people!
It did happen that one technician took a phone call while doing my nails, but I m also busy w my phone/book or reading papers, so I don t see a problem with that, since my nails are getting done and well done!
As for The friendliness, never had an issue there either. They (and ALL of them have always been super friendly. They remember their customers,and details about their lives, which in this world matter.
Mai will always say the few french words she knows, and Ana will sing me some French songs!<//Text>

< review>
These ladies are great! They always a smile on their face and remember you every time you visit. On top of that, they do a great job on your nails. I have had a regular Mani and Pedi, as well as a gel Mani/Pedi. Both turned out great and were done in a timely manner. Next time around, I am hoping to try their power nail treatment to get those long coffin nails that are so in fashion!!!!<//review>

Too much wait time even if you prebook. If you havent prebooked you must just die waiting.

I still liked their nail care. The place has good service you can tell because it's packed with people all the time.</Text>

<Review>I am writing this review due to  their wonderful service. The staff here are super friendly. They always greet clients with a warm welcome when you step in and I always feel appreciated as a regular client. I come here every three weeks for my Pedi, Gelac and Waxing services.  Just remember to bring cash to tip if you pay with card.</Review>< user_id>

<Time>1548816505765< /Time><rating>3<//rating><review>I go here all the time because it's right by my house. But it's very expensive. They charge like $20 extra for gel. If you want a design its $20 more. They even have different price points for pedicures and if you want just a simple scrub it's like $20 more than the most basic pedicure. It's pretty ridiculous.

It also gets busy and they dont have a lot of staff. They have certain people who work there who only know how to do pedicures or paint nails. Only a few of the ladies can do all services like acrylic/fills, designs, waxing. Its important to call and make an appointment or you will be waiting all day for the one person who can assist you!

They are really nice though and the spa itself is a nice space. It's in a very convenient location (although finding parking can be a nightmare).

I think I'm ready to find a new place that doesnt add so many charges to what I feel are basic services that should be like $5 more, not $20. And a place with more trained staff.

But since this place is right by where I live, I'm sure I'll be back :/  its not horrible but I wish it wasnt my regular place because I know it's way overpriced and under quality of service!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Two of my nails got a cut while the worker file my nails. The color of the nails look pretty ok. Maybe the worker can double check the nail after she is finish since there are some uneven spots. The worker also did my nails pretty fast which may have lead to some problems. This is an ok place to do nails but also not the best.</text>

Horrible experience.  The staff are impatient, rude and during my last visit, the technician cut me 6, yes SIX times while filing.  They should be skilled and patient and careful not to be abrasive to your skin with a nail file.  Technicians should also put the time into the filing process, not just brush over the tip of the nail very quickly then move on to the next step.  Unbelievable.  The staff are charming just to keep you waiting, even when you have an appointment.  Then, when they resume very rude expressions when the technician begins working on your nails.</text>

I have gone to this place for a while now, they make you get appointments, which they never keep up, and have little care for timing. If your in their good books, they will take care of you, or throw a fit and it might help, so its all about luck here, really, not very professional. They lose headcount constantly , and can't handle the crowd especially on the weekends and evenings. The manager waxed my eye lashes while doing my eyebrows and said she was sorry and that she was sick. If your sick, you should not come to work. The good employees always seem to leave, they never stay. Also a good one will start your pedicure or mani and a not so good one will take over. Since they get so much business, as they are the only ones in the area, they don't care about feedback or being professional. Its sad, how most people struggle under growth and have no professional approach.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I would strongly suggest not to go here. The ladies who work there are rude, they dont even have basic courtesies.  They made me wait for 45 minutes despite having an appointment. When they ask for a tip they suddenly act all nice. Not just that, I got my manicure and pedicure...they did not have the colour I asked for and used a different colour saying it is similar. The colour that the used was old and dry so she added some nail Polish remover to it. She did a pathetic job of painting my nails and within a day my nails look awful. She hurt me even when she was removing my cuticles. Do not go to this place...find other places to get your nails done. Money gone down the drain and horrible service.< /review>< Time>

At first, I wasn't greeted when I came in. I wanted a regular pedicure. After I sat down on their non-massage chairs one of the girls started doing stuff with my toes. Didn't introduce herself or even acknowledge me. Then another woman did my toes. She was nice and friendly but did a horrible job with the manicure. I think I can do a better job. Nail polish everywhere, nails cut crooked, and she cut into my skin at the top on my toe and it's been hurting ever since. Def would not recommend this place!!<//text>

<Text>There are no massage chairs.  The pedicure they offer is ok, but without the massage chair it feels like I missed out on half of the relaxation.  They do offer many different services for nails.  I would probably not come here if it weren't walking distance.< /Text></record>

<text>WORST Nail place ever and it was also pretty pricey considering how badly their customer service was. I walked in waited about 2 min before someone greeted me, then they ask me to take a seat. The lady working on my nails kept stopping to text and receive phone calls, took over an hour to finish, mind you i was on my hour lunch, and when she was done i was really unsatisfied with the work and the price. Never will i refer or go back to River Mark Nail Spa</text>< pictures>

Holy yikes. What a train wreck.

I came to this place because I needed a pedicure and couldn't get in anywhere else. Desperate times call for desperate measures but my advice about this place is to trust the reviews!!

Two people left the salon screaming in the first 15 minutes that I was there, guests were left waiting and unattended to, and what so many have said about the actual nail service turned out to be true- the pedicure hurt, was totally rushed, the woman doing my nails left in the middle of it to work on someone else, and just when I thought it couldn't get any worse the technician asked me to tip her rather than letting me tip at my own discretion. The entire experience was awful.

I think $25 is a fair price for a basic pedicure but in this instance it just felt like throwing money down the drain. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and would say its worth the inconvenience of driving farther to get your nails done elsewhere.< /text>

One of the top brunches in San Diego! The brunch menu is small, only having 6 items or so, but everything is phenomenal. The chicken and biscuit is the best I’ve ever had. Seriously. I’ve had the most famous ones in the South and this beats it. Have a cocktail or cold brew with your meal and enjoy. The service is very personable and professional. Brunch starts at 11 am on Saturday and Sunday, and sometimes they offer the lunch/dinner menu as well.</Text>

This place is really unique in the sense of it’s like a small more laid-back chill type of atmosphere, it’s not as dimly lit as I would like my bars to be but that’s just my preference. The drinks were definitely very unique and flavorful, with their own types of spin to them their own unique blends and this is one of the reasons why I would come back just to kind of try everything out and see what I really like. The atmosphere was cool there were some hipsters in there the art wall Decour and couches have like a nice set up to where you feel kind of like you’re inside your own home dope place overall in kind of a hidden gem.< /review>

<text>I can’t get enough of this place, from their unique layout of the location to their amazing seasonal drinks.
I want to try everything on the menu, whenever i’m in town I have to stop by for a drink.
Do yourself a favor and have a mind blowing experience, you owe it to yourself ;)< /text>< Rating>

Love the food and service!  Chad and Cesar would accommodate all my taste buds whims for fresh, raw, pasta, or truffle!  If I can't decide, they help me decide it make up something for me with the perfect paring of wine and/or cocktails!  Great interiors, service, and fire flues!<//Review>

Cool distillery with craft cocktails featuring their homemade gin and vodkas. Laid back bartenders and lounge furniture created a cool vibe. Definitely more of a female menu as the cocktails were a little fruity.</Text>

The spirits themselves were genuinely impressive and my only complaint is that they don't have a wider distribution, so I'm just hoarding the bottles I brought home.</Review>< pics>

Favorite bar in San Diego! Cocktails are to die for, the interior design of the tasting room belongs in a spread of Architectural Digest, and every server I’ve interacted with has been warm and welcoming. I celebrate most big life moments here, and you should too!< /Text>

VODKA + SODA

F* white claw, YOU is the truth. Facts: real vodka in their soda (7.5%) compared to white claw no no real vodka only alcohol is the fermentation of the sugar.

The bar is cute and quaint. Came here for the Topo Chico and Tamales event, free Topo Chico but not free Tamales. That night they featured a small variety of Tamales to purchase, I had the strawberry tamale and it was good. Never had a pink tamale drizzled with condense milk until that night. I didn't order any of the special Topo Chico cocktails (ex: og, vodka, Topo Chico) because someone next to me referenced that cocktail took away the fizz of the Topo Chico.

In addition, my friends and I attended the Meat Ball and You & Yours was a vendor there. I had an unlimited amount of generous free pours of all their canned cocktail flavors (vodka mule, gin & tonic, vodka cranberry soda, key lime vodka soda). All were good but my favs were key lime vodka soda.

And You & Yours sells in some local grocery store. I was bummed to know that on weekdays they don't open until 4pm. I happen to stumble upon a case at Lazy Acres grocery store of my favorite Key Lime vodka soda. It's my go to drink when I go sailing!

Overall, good stuff. Kind of pricy but worth the buzz.<//review>

<Text>What a lovely space with such high-quality cocktails! They are made with such care and expertise that the cocktails are worth their premium prices. This East Village distillery is certainly worth checking out for at least a drink. A hidden highlight is that this is a female-owned establishment!< /Text>< resp>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Delicious craft cocktails on happy hour, but subpar service,  In addition to the seasonal summer cocktail menu, there's also a happy hour menu featuring a few of the cocktails. I'm glad my husband and I went with the happy hour menu - the drinks are essentially 50% off from $12 to $8.

The "Prized Pony" is a refreshing summer cocktail. It reminds of the Moscow Mule with vodka, ginger, lime, mint, and peach bitters.

"Do You Want That Spicy" cocktail has a spicy kick from the Serraro bitters. A strong Citrus flavor from the grapefruit, lime, and cucumber.

My husband and I enjoyed both drinks and going to get a 2nd round, but stopped short due to the lack of service. There was a big bachelor party that sat down before us and my husband and I patiently waited for 40 minutes to get our drinks. Once everyone in the party got their drinks and others were served at the bar, we walked up to the bar and were ignored by the bartenders. While I understand they are busy making drinks, they didn't acknowledge my husband and I until we requested to close out. They seemed apathetic and not welcoming.

Great distillery and cocktails, but be prepared to wait for them! The distillery allows dogs, so feel free to bring your furry friend.</Review>< response>

<Review>Ridiculous attention to service and guest satisfaction.
Old world respects paid regardless of the guest's disposition.
Top notch.
Look nowhere else for elevated dining in Commerce.

Steven's is a local favorite that's been here for decades! Newly remodeled with an updated menu, it's a great place for a romantic dinner or a family dinner. We've also been able to rent an entire room for our special event.<//text>

Steven steak and seafood house is one of my favorite places to go. It is elegant and refined, it has wonderful service, wonderful food and a full bar. The last time I was there I had a wonderful dinner that included a bowl of chicken noodle soup, a side plate of spaghetti with bolognese sauce, and then for the main course I had a whole chicken breast marinated and grilled, four slices of very tender tri-tip cooked medium rare to rare and was perfection and garlic shrimp scampi served on top of rice pilaf with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic and a lovely gravy and fresh asparagus tips cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce béarnaise and the total price for this magnificent meal was $27! There's steaks are aged beef there's seafood is fresh as can be and anything I have ordered here has simply been prepared, presented and serve to perfection. They also tend at Stevens to seat people late on certain days and nights up till midnight so this is a restaurant that has been a great experience in all ways has been open for over 50 years and the manager Eddie is one of the most accommodating managers of a restaurant I have ever met<//text>

<Text>This place USED!!! To be great food, music, and atmosphere. We came in Saturday night with a party of 11. The food took 2 1/2 hours to be served. We only got started with bread and water and our first round of drinks. We thought the food was going to be worth the wait. But when we got the food it was HORRIBLE. Everyone at our table commented since we all got something different from the menu. The chicken was overcooked (dry) veggies were raw. Steaks were super greasy, fries that didn't get drain, Salmon half cooked. 10 mins into getting our food the buzz boy came around asking us if we needed boxes and how many. Pressuring us to eat and leave. That's how we all felt. Everything was just Terrible. Staff from the restaurant not wearing facial covers and others. Too bad the managers, Sandra and Eddie only came around one time to our table before our food was out or else they would have acknowledged The Terrible situation with our food.
Waste of time and money The bill was just ridiculous $459.00 for the food we did not eat enjoy neither recommend.< /Text></record>

On the 15th of may my daughter and my 2 best friends had a surprise birthday party for my 60th birthday. Excited and eager to spend my birthday with loved ones turned out to be a very disappointing event. The servers tried their best to accommodate everyone. With one server only being on the job for 3 days. Tried her best. My comadre asked that the food be served at 6:00  as all our guest had arrived,  the salad was first and some tables were missed than the food was served. And the food was cold some guest left without eating. And very disappointined . I never saw our host but one time. With being overwhelmed by the complaints.  I had decided to have the party at Steven steakhouse because I like to.support our city's business.  And was thinking of having my granddaughters sweet 16 but after speaking with the owner and having a taste of his rudeness.  Never will I use Steve steakhouse.</Review>

<Review>I usually love the Prime Rib here, but since covid the food was a little salty and they serve the garlic mash potatoes with corn all over it.  Assuming they lost some of the cooks.  Will wait a good while before making a long  drive from Hawtorne.< /Review><Rate>3</Rate>< time>

< review>
Old School steakhouse in East LA that is worth the trip.  We were a party of 9 who all had a great experience.  The steaks and seafood were prepared well, the service was attentive and for the quality, the prices were good.  All the steaks were a little undercooked (not to the point anything was sent back) so keep that in mind when ordering.</review>

My friends and i came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it was certainly a very pleasant experience.

The daily lunch specials were an awesome deal (especially for the price), their bread and butter was really good, and their prime rib was also really good.

To top it all off, the service was just absolutely amazing!  I'm not a big dessert gal but make sure your try their chocolate cake with ice cream!< /text>

This place is a disgrace of a steak house
It’s actually a hall for parties & events terrible over priced drinks , I order the filet mignon med-well received it burnt to a crisp lobster tail boiled and flavorless garlic fries taste like pork rinds and they never brought me rice pilaf I had ordered on the side, salmon also very dry & flavorless do yourself a favor and don’t bother coming here<//review>

Can’t say enough how incredible the food and service is here.  This is what food service is meant to be. Jim was incredible running the front desk. I was blown away with his professionalism that I wanted to tip him extra and he would not accept.  I drive 30 min each way to pick up food to go for my wife and I - and it’s worth it. Try the Crab legs and Filet.  Best I have had and I try them everywhere.  Thanks again Jim.</Review>

The place is cozy but needs a complete remodel. The carpets were old and stained. The food was OK. There are big rooms for conferences. The salmon steal fish was well cooked.< /Review>

Place is old and poorly maintained.  By looking at the carpet you can't help but to wonder how the kitchen is.  Food flavor was amazing but my meat was well done... so well done that I couldn't eat it.  I was at an event so I don't know who's fault was it.  Very few  vegetables and almost no mashed potatoes but flavor was very good.  Dessert was chocolate cake,  very good too, and they also served bread with butter.   Now,  a small glass of coke $6.00!!!  Meal was $35.00.< /text>

Service was excellent!! Food was amazing! Atmosphere was romantic.  If your looking for a quiet date night come before 7. After 9 it gets super busy. They still serve their full menu. And  and will have a DJ or live band with a dance floor. But we wanted it calm and sexy.<//Review>

Steven's is an old nostalgic place. I attended a birthday celebration there and can't really comment of the food in general. It has a seventies vibe. Rustic interior but cozy atmosphere. I had a vegetarian meal prepare and I must say it was delicious! The other guest had a combination of turf and surf and it didn't look appetizing.  It was a standard banquet meal with no wow factor. However, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Valet parking is available for $5.00. The 3 star rating is only because I didn't visit the main restaurant for dining. I will return and give another review after that visit.</Text>

This spot sure knows how to take care of their customers. Regularly with a very nice mindset. The food is affordably priced, regularly flavorful and clean.<//text>

The place is a little dated, but over all a nice venue. Has multiple reception halls for events. Staff is great, friendly, and very accomodating. The buffet style food for events was very good. There were many choices and something for everyone of all ages. Super fresh salads, fruit salads, and side dishes. There was a stage in the section I went to. There was also a street entrance that unfortunately was not monitored or secured and uninvited guests crashed the party, of which we had to escort out without security.</review>

<Text>The service is impeccable, Every dinner comes with soup or salad, highly recommend the French onion soup. And order the garlic cheese bread. My husband ordered the prime rib, so soft and buttery.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2cfaaa7f54255:0xe7e825bccba9ba3e</gmapID><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVVO3btbIkHC2UAmBaD-N_jOT4y-G9CHTcwhvN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQGE5mAsvJ-JQvgrLCHxPngu-Tgsk21QPnrgiF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd_Pabpy2SF2vlgv3EirTbYdC6rMTgEtQYmYJM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrnH9JMgnPeYvKVTQbpGYU-YFAW5VfdGRidr9W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOujC9ftHUY8gSei-Wl9DqEza8orRP7EdBza0o5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

We love eating out. Yesterday we  found this magnificent restaurant which friends told us about. We had a beautiful time there with delicious meal and an efficient team and a distinguished chief cook. We  added this place in our phone list  and we shall certainly come back soon. We highly recommend.</Text>

Very nice place to eat and to top it off a customer had an advertising truck that played the Dodger game on 3 sides of his truck on big screens...Go Dodgers !

Thank you Steven's Steakhouse for a good night out !<//Text>

I give them a high five excellent service food was delicious I had the New York steak nice and tender we celebrated my nephew's 16th birthday there waiter and waitress was kind and prompt so if you're looking for a steakhouse they serve more than steak so if you're looking for a steakhouse stop by and experience their food there<//Review>

<date>1528781920890<//date><rate>4<//rate><text>We've passed this place several times. Now, I'm kind of mad at myself for not stopping sooner. This restaurant is pretty great! We came for the specials they put on Facebook. Steak and Lobster and prime rib special. We also took advantage of the Martini special.

When you first walk in, the hostess is all smiles. The booths are quaint and the tables are roomy. The dining area is spacious. Our waitress was pretty new but very attentive. She wasn't familiar with any of the specials. I had to show her and she went to verify pricing and inclusions. Aside from that, it was a great encounter.
The steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The lobster tail was a very nice size and also, cooked to perfection.
The prime rib was HUGE! It was cooked perfectly along with the sides.
We were both very surprised at the sizeable portions. The martinis were really good too!. We also ordered an arnold palmer and a coke. Not sure if they give refills as we were not offered any.
There is only one restroom for each gender so on a crowded day, it could be pressing but, we didn't experience that at all. The music was nice and so were the staff.

This was a great encounter and I am anxious to get back with friends and family!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW1k_f4KHu3-kgt8_mZCdF2K9ZDQoxcbei2y2w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg2s58rE2M_0GCNNsXh12tI-ltDjbo4wEjlb_8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI1QZp4C3GBc0B8mqPZKVNGKua-mP51_OtQvPV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoiOxslZJxPB5UKgUWs0P6fN5MzsJOWpXbnson=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

The service is impeccable, Every dinner comes with soup or salad, highly recommend the French onion soup. And order the garlic cheese bread. My husband ordered the prime rib, so soft and buttery.< /text>

I've been here for lunch several times and the food was pretty good, they have some really good lunch specials. But,  my office just had it's Christmas party there, the food was supposed par. We had appetizers of chips and vegetables.  I was unimpressed. The main meal consisted of prime rib, twice baked potato, salad with dinner rolls. The side dishes were good to very good. But the main dish, the prime rib, as one of my coworkers put it "they killed it twice". It was so well done it was almost leather.  So go for lunch but skip a banquet.< /text>

I go to this excellent place every couple of days since I love the good mood that is characterizes this restaurant. The crew is exceptionally attentive and qualified. The service is pretty efficient. Needless to say, the food they prepare is first-rate. I frequent often and I was always delighted. The cost is honest. I recommend this place to my friends and family.<//text>

My wife and I waited 3 and half hours to be seated, even though, we made reservations. They promised to take care of us, but that just entailed a dessert. To add insult to injury there was no parking due to the fact that multiple parties were booked, and the reserved customers were not notified. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and because of our elation, we kept a positive outlook, then when we were seated, and our server was definitely showing us that they didn't want to be there. It was a terrible experience, also the bathrooms were flooded and disgusting. Communication and customer service are key, especially, if you are going to charge a high competitive price. Had we known that the service was going to be horrendous and the wait time deplorable, we would've just down graded and spent it at Sizzling Sizzler. I would've given Steven's one star, but they did hook up dessert. Thanks.< /Text>

<Name>Cathy Anderson</Name><time>1584590457106<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>This visit was sponsored by the company for which I work, so there was a crowd of us gathered for our end-of-year celebration back in December 2019. We were served a salad and bread right away, and drinks were provided. I ordered the prime rib with loaded potatoes and my guest ordered the salmon with the loaded potatoes as well. The vegetable was green beans. Every bite was delicious! I hesitated ordering the prime rib because I hate being disappointed, but Steve’s nailed it. It was cooked to my usual rare satisfaction and served with a most splendid au jus. I tasted the salmon as well and it was perfectly cooked and served with a wonderfully tasty lemon sauce with capers. The potatoes were full of yummy goodness. (Side note- I am not fond of loaded potatoes) The green beans were tender-crisp and lightly seasoned as to not take away from their natural flavor. The staff was super friendly and helpful, someone was always available to fill a glass or answer a question, but didn’t hover around. I can’t wait for my next experience here! I and my guest had a great time.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>This place is great, has a lot to offer. They have a restaurant with some outstanding food that has been serving the area since the mid-1950s. Once you eat there you'll know why! The bar area is a blast, they have salsa dancing and  lessons. My family has been going there for three generations, and I'm sure so have plenty other families. We have also enjoyed plenty of functions in their banquet rooms !<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2cfaaa7f54255:0xe7e825bccba9ba3e</GmapID></record>

<text>It was my first time there.  Seen Mr Brenton Wood.  1st When doors open at 6:30 they should LITERALLY be open. 2nd. This was Totally so Very Disorganized!! The check in process is Outdated! We were left standing outside in the Cold night air way to long. 3rd. Why are people served Seafood? There Should be an option for something else.  They know crowds are showing up why not have ENOUGH wait staff for these events? I'm open to try some other time but hoping my experience will be better.  Loved seeing Brenton Wood!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdG-i-s1-QQb08tLRWEdwtZRJ4-xQT_KBIdNG4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

The worse experience I’ve ever had at a restaurant. I had made a reservation for 830pm for my wife and I for Valentine’s Day, weeks before. It was to include a live concert and dinner however, we arrived and the hostess told us they weren’t honoring reservations due to the high volume of customers.(It seems that they just wanted to make as much money as possible that night by rushing and cramming people in and out of the restaurant.) Worst of all, when I initially called for the reservations the hostess on the phone assured me that I would have admission to the concert w/o putting down credit card information nor purchasing any tickets in advance. She made it seem as if it was dinner and a show and we would just pay a cover charge at the door. However to my shock, when we arrived it was in a separate room and sold out, having to had bought the tickets in advance. Unfortunately, we stayed saying to ourselves “surely the food must be decent. I mean how worse can things get??” But they did! The food was terrible and bland. The side of vegetable that came with our entrees was such a tiny portion I mean literally 3 pieces of grilled veggies and the mashed potatoes came in about 2 tablespoon servings! It was a joke! I don’t recommend this place to anyone. Stay clear!< /text>

<Date>1581756381226<//Date><rate>1</rate><review>Just got back from the Valentine's Day Sinatra Show and I must say i was disappointed with the event. The band was fantastic but the service and presentation was horrible. We were moved after we were seated because the staff couldn't get their seating arranged ahead of time and had trash all over the floor towards the back of the room. The chairs had bits of food on the seat and was ripped. The staff didn't mention the drinks (coffee, water, lemonade) were not included in the ticket. The staff took quite a long time to bring the drinks and food. The salad tasted gritty and improperly washed. The plate that the salad came on had a brown smudge on the rim and was obviously not cleaned well. About another 40minutes later the meal was served. The steak was as tough as leather and it only came with 2 shrimp on top of the mashed potato ( supposed to be a steak and shrimp dinner). Each person was so cramped I felt the hip of the person sitting next to me every time he moved. It was very uncomfortable. I have been at trainings for MUSD that were held here but these events are usually free. This is the worst way I could have spent $70. I will see the Wiseguys again at another show that is not held at Steven's Steakhouse. The staff and owner have no pride in this establishment.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I’m open to changing this review should the staff decide to change to circumstances.

It’s Wednesday night. Not the busiest of nights for Steven’s. I have been here at least 25 times.  Days and nights.

Tonight I ordered the hefty Big Jim cut prime rib at a hefty 40+ dollars. RARE.  I always order the largest cut so it provides several meals at home as well and when reheated is perfect.

Served medium well!!!  😶. Reheating would create shoe leather.  Not interested.

Sent it back. Waiting the 45 min they told me it would take and drinking the ABSOLUTELY PERFECT Ciroc apple martini.

I will edit if necessary

No edit means. No appropriate resolution.

Edit for above review<//review>

The hall is rented at a fair price; special events are reasonably priced (average cost is $30) and include a full buffet. Quality live bands provide the entertainment, and the large dance floor is usually filled with eager dancers. I have been to Stevens Steakhouse six times in the past two years and I always have a great time!< /Review>

The food was decent, but awesomely priced.  What I really liked about it was...well...I guess the nostalgia of the place.  Half the wait staff was over 60 and you get the feeling they have been there since the place opened.  I think the owner seated us.  This place has been around a long time and you can tell (in a good way). I enjoyed myself.</text>

<Review>The draw to Steven's Steak & Seafood is definitely the entertainment. If you enjoy salsa dancing, bring your A game and you'll have a great time. Food was totally unremarkable, however. It wasn't bad, but I was disappointed. I remember the food being better. Drinks are also on the pricier side; a rum & coke was $10.50 and the rum selection was pretty awful.

If you're coming here to dance, then it's a great place. For dinner and drinks you can do better.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Great food! Huge portions, everything is absolutely delicious and good service to. The music is fantastic, sometimes they have entertainers, the happy hour is fantastic and it's right off the interstate 5. Location location location<//text>

Don't come on salsa nights (Wednesday and Sundays) the music is way too loud!(despite numerous complaints and a talk with the manager they still wouldn't turn it down) it was so loud I could barely hear myself think let alone talk to my friends.
Also I had to wait 50 min to my steak, and when it finally came it was over cooked (I asked for medium well and got well done).< /review>

Large dance floor in the ballroom! We were there for a fundraiser which included a lunch buffet (salad, pasta, chicken & beef). Always elegant table settings with white table cloths.
Four bands performed so everyone had a great time dancing!
We've been here several times and enjoy returning each time.< /Text>

Great place for dancing on Sundays.

The valet parking is great, you may have to wait a bit, if it's busy to place your order.

If you are doing an event, it's best to find out ahead of time, the number of waitress or waiters you will have. We finish our dinner and our wine never arrived.

We feel bad for the girl handling our table, she had too many tables and still managed to keep a happy  face. I hope the manager takes it seriously that the business looks bad, not the service.<//Review>

This place is a nice place for your family events, weddings or birthday parties...however service was lacking. Went to my mom's holiday party. Food was good but my negative comment and we were barely served beverages...the place was busy with other functions happening at the same time. Parking is limited as well</Text>

Never going back because of the poor service that the waitress had lost my husband's credit card and brought back two different cards that were not his. Her excuse was that it was too dark and said she couldn't see the name on the card. I'm calling the manager tomorrow to complain.< /review>

Our visit was completely unplanned. After visiting the HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME i was hungry and simply wanted some seafood. Google maps directed us to STEVENS.

I was completely unprepared for the experience. The restaurant was elegant yet relaxed. We are seated by a handsome classy gentleman in a nice tux. The seating allowed for privacy and pleasant conversation.

The service and food was WONDERFUL! Everything was beautifully plated and DELICIOUS. I would definitely go again.

The prices could be considered pricey depending on what you're use to. Our meal for 3 came to roughly $94 not including the $30 tip. This is not an environment i would bring small children.

I loved it!< /Text>

<Review>The food here is amazing. Once you order your main dish , they give you dinner rolls , a salad plate for everyone, a plate of spaghetti with meaty marinara sauce and by the time you get to the main dish you ordered you're full.</Review>< gmap_id>

Barbara was so sweet and attentive.  Our food was delicious as we celebrated our first anniversary being MARRIED . We missed Steven's due to COVID-19 and couldn't be more happier now that you're opened outside.  You will be warm listening to music and eating the best prime rib😍❤💯< /Text>

The food and service here are top notch. While the staff are dressed in their tuxedo best, patrons from casual to business attire frequent this long time favorite dining favorite. A wide selection menu will keep any appetite happy with mouth watering, tender and tasty prime rib at the top of my menu choice with a HUGE 32oz Big Jim cut.<//Text>

The hostess looked ok, but there was only one server who looked decent . She was wearing a short skirt but she still looked professional,  unfortunately the others where wearing, black nylons and short, short, black shorts. I am sorry but they looked like they should be working in a sleazy bar instead of an elegant steak house.<//review>< pics>

Very nice nice atmosphere, relaxing music. Food was delicious and presented very well- very worth the price.  Staff was very professional and extremely nice.

Stop care for a meeting and dinner. Enjoyed the steak as well as the service from the staff. Steak was cooked correctly and had a great flavor. Great place for a private party or meetings. An old school look with great food.< /Text>

Went for a Christmas party & they must have had an additional 4 parties going on at the same time, had ppl from other parties going thru ours to get to theirs &.....they ONLY HAVE 2 LADIES RESTROOMS!!!! Not kidding when I say I had to wait over 30min & the line going to the upstairs restroom, "total fire hazard" as ppl waited going up & ppl trying to get down. Seen a few ladies close off the men's so other women/lil girls could use it. You've been warned, avoid if you can.< /review>

The place has an amazing ambient, starting with the elegant and fine decoration for tables, you'll be wow!!! It is a really nice and very intimate place to have a decent dinner. But what made me feel surprised it is not pricey at all, they have very affordable dishes and they give you more than you expect for the entrees, the meats are awesome, wonderful meat cuts and they cost what they mean to be. The salsa night with the salsa band Chino Espinoza was the complement for our friday night. Fantastic. Servers are professional on what they're doing' the place has a dancefloor, what else would you ask for.< /text>

It's been around a Long time. In need of a Serious interior upgrade. Carpets upstairs are old and FILTHY! Too many separate parties going on at the same time and people from different parties have to walk through other party areas to get to the bathrooms. VERY OLD PLACE!<//review>

Don't come on Wednesdays and Sundays for the restaurant. The music is way too loud. We asked several times to turn the music down, even from the manager, but they said "there is nothing we can do".
Moreover, the steaks served almost an hour after we ordered them, and one of them was overcooked.
Our experience was terrible</text>

Made reservations. When we got there, the front desk lady was rude and told us we had to wait more than an hour, that everyone waiting had a reservation. I don't understand why take reservations if then can accommodate everyone.< /review>

I wouldnt concider this to be an acutal steakhouse. It's more of a club with a mini restaurant in between 2 loud dancefloors .  I give it a three and not a 1star due to the steak was cooked perfectly as for the rest of the food i was disappointed veggies are over cooked, salad wasnt an impressive freshness. Crab legs have no meet in it what so ever for the $25 they charge for a small bowl. Drinks are highly priced.  Service wasn't good my waiter disappeared most of the time  food took long to come out, took her 10min to bring check took another 10 to get charged (not even by her by someone who walked by and asked if we needed anything)<//text>

I had the prime rib lady cut for lunch, which was big enough at 12oz. It also came with soup of the day and baked potato wth butter chives and sour cream. Great prime rib but the french onion soup was very salty. The decor is retro steakhouse in that the have kept this decor since who knows when.<//Review>

Girlfriend and I both ordered the Filet Mignon Combo with Australian Lobster tail. Service was AMAZING. The servers really take care of the customers. However, food was very very disappointing. The lobster and steak had no flavor at all. I was very disappointed, they waved a plate, however we were not satisfied. I will not be returning.</text>

Nice steak. Matching the review stars. But a lot of noises and the music is pretty loud when I was there. If you just go for steak, be sure no activity.</Review>

Friendly and welcoming service from host to server. The food is good but the place seems a but dated - it can use some modern updates on but he exterior and interior. I recommend their prime rib, perfect for two and carrot cake for dessert. You won't be disappointed.</Text>

<text>Came here to a private dinner, instead of been splendid with a small group of people and show us their best service it was the opposite. Worst terrible service at all levels. No waitresss coordination and no pay attention to customer, no etiquette at all. Bathrooms are a mess.

Ordered a meat dish and it was over cooked, tasteless, I could barely eat that.

Glad to know I wasn't paying for it and I will no recommend and will not return to this restaurant.<//text>< Pictures>

However the toilets were backed up and no one was interested in fixing it since we got there. An employee told me it's been like that for months! I addressed this to the manager who told me that it was being fixed. I don't think it was.<//Review></record>

THIS PLACE IS NOT OPEN UNTIL 2AM FOR RESTURANT SERVICES!! ONLY THE BAR/"CLUB" AREA. IF YOU'RE COMING HERE AND ARENT IN YOUR SEAT AND ORDERED BY THEIR LAST CALL AT 9:45pm, YOU WILL NOT GET FOOD.  Wasted 7 bucks on an uber here because of false advertisement. (Walked in at 9:46pm and was denied).<//Review>

If I come for dinner, I always order the Big Jim cut Prime Rib.  You can't go wrong there.  My wife and I split the Crab a la Roberto which was heavenly.  She had a fish taco dish that she loved and we closed the meal with their AMAZING bread pudding.  You couple that with some great drinks, awesome service and salsa music - what more could we ask for.  We loved it and it made our Anniversary very memorable.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I stopped by here as a mistake and was in for a lovely surprise. Price is reasonable but it was like getting thrown back in time to the rat pack era. Everyone was dressed to the 9s that were the staff nice ambiance. Live music place is great and they have a good happy hour. I will come back!< /Review>

<GmapID>0x80c2cfaaa7f54255:0xe7e825bccba9ba3e< /GmapID><Text>Went for lunch. Cool looking inside. Very old-school fancy. Expensive menu, BUT, they do offer a very reasonable priced lunch menu. They do four daily specials, all you can eat of it, for 10.95 I ordered triangles of beef. More like thinly sliced prime rib. Came with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie medley. The first plate was plenty for me, so didn't need to ask for more. The meal is preceded with warm sour dough rolls and  choice different soups or salad. The day I went, they had french onion or split pea. I opted for the split pea. It was really delicious. Veggie medley I wasn't impressed with it was green beans zucchini and carrots. Just not into bagged mini carrots that are steamed, or green beans it is still kind of crunchy. I noticed they had some other veggies oh, I wish I were asparagus which I actually would have preferred but you special of the day didn't come with that. The garlic mashed potatoes were excellent. The meat, was okay it's not my favorite kind of meat but it was still tasty after I dipped it in the horseradish cream sauce. It also came with a liquid size to defend I guess that you would for prime rib. If I were to order steaks or me I wouldn't order prime rib but I ended up getting this because I was craving meat. It just wasn't as tender as I like or have that meat flavor that I like but it was still good. Service was decent staff are friendly just not on great. Just seemed like she was off game. If I'm in the area which was across the street get my car repaired, and it's around lunch time I would go again. With tax the mail came to 12:05. I didn't order any drains I just had water.<//Text><rating>4</rating><user_id>100931120738735213195<//user_id>< Pics>

I don't know if this is a fair rating because we went to a New Year's eve dinner and dance. The Restaurant side of this place seemed much different than the banquet room side. I would give it another try but not for a party just for dinner. Mass production of food usually is only ok.<//review>

<Review>Went for lunch. Cool looking inside. Very old-school fancy. Expensive menu, BUT, they do offer a very reasonable priced lunch menu. They do four daily specials, all you can eat of it, for 10.95 I ordered triangles of beef. More like thinly sliced prime rib. Came with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie medley. The first plate was plenty for me, so didn't need to ask for more. The meal is preceded with warm sour dough rolls and  choice different soups or salad. The day I went, they had french onion or split pea. I opted for the split pea. It was really delicious. Veggie medley I wasn't impressed with it was green beans zucchini and carrots. Just not into bagged mini carrots that are steamed, or green beans it is still kind of crunchy. I noticed they had some other veggies oh, I wish I were asparagus which I actually would have preferred but you special of the day didn't come with that. The garlic mashed potatoes were excellent. The meat, was okay it's not my favorite kind of meat but it was still tasty after I dipped it in the horseradish cream sauce. It also came with a liquid size to defend I guess that you would for prime rib. If I were to order steaks or me I wouldn't order prime rib but I ended up getting this because I was craving meat. It just wasn't as tender as I like or have that meat flavor that I like but it was still good. Service was decent staff are friendly just not on great. Just seemed like she was off game. If I'm in the area which was across the street get my car repaired, and it's around lunch time I would go again. With tax the mail came to 12:05. I didn't order any drains I just had water.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This was my first time at this restaurant, my mom had been there a million times before. Our waiter Kali (sorry if I spelt it wrong 😁) made the night so enjoyable for us. We had such a long hard day at the Hospital and my mom decided she wanted me to try Steven's for the first time. From the moment we sat down till the last bite of Tiramisu for dessert, Kali showed us an amazing time. He was Charming and depicted exactly what the restaurant's theme was... classy. Thank you so much for the amazing recommendations Kali!!! We will be back for the crab leg appetizer and you!!!!</Text>

Very disappointed.... I made a reservation for Valentine’s Day back in January 5 !
When there today to selebrate Valentine’s Day with my husband, only to be sited on literary 2x2 table that was moving sideways, we asked to be moved and of course we were moved to the same size table ( all tho it was half empty) . On top of everything when we were leaving I asked to speak to the manager, and went I tried to explain to him that this is not correct sense I have reserved a table from so long I don’t think I should of be sitting on the middle of the restaurant  on lil 2x2 table. His response was ( well you should of ask for bigger table). This is stupid! So  disappointed ...!</Text>

Música was great, but services with Waitress was horrible, they are rude, unwelcome, with no customer service at all. We had to go to get our drinks to the bar all the time, the bartender was courteous and polite, the other sure learn from him, how to treat customers. Food was good.< /Text>

The food was ok , we were there for a birthday party.  The service was slow and the food quality was ok for the price. Dont think I would go back again. Also the drinks are pricey,  1 bloody mary that was watery and 1 mojito came to $26.< /text>

<Review>Excellent steak but better can be found for the same price. My medium rare steak was closer to medium, but there's not a lot of options around here. Fast service around lunchtime during the week as there are very few people.< /Review>< user>

Only one star because zero wasn't an option. Nice staff but the food was low grade dog food. Sent my steak back and wouldn't order another. Stevens doesn't know if it's a steakhouse, Mexican restaurant, Chinese (egg rolls), Italian or Jewish deli (quesadilla with pastrami). Enough said.< /text>

Ordered a Cadillac margarita. It used to be $10.50 a couple of months ago. NOW it is $13.75. It's the price of a bottle almost... Way too much for one drink, which is why most people we're having WATER. Guess I will have my drink before leaving the house next time.</review>

I normally don't review but had to do an exception. I do agree this place does its own reviews.. Went to a big celebration this weekend and it was Overly priced, considering what we received. The the steak had to much fat and dry. The a/c did not work,  too hot,  the silver wear I had to ask to replace it and still reclean it myself...,the customer service is terrible!!  I had never seen so many unhappy waitresses and waiters in one place. They served Tap water,  unfiltered I was told by them and had to request over and over....with no luck.  You would think with all the $$ they would invest in upgrading the place...I will not return and never will recommend. I was glad I went home... I hope they actually check their true reviews...<//Text>

Note: this reviews is only for their salsa event.

Called on Saturday afternoon to check whether there will be a salsa event. The staff told us that the event will start at 9:30. We got there at 10 and paid for valet parking (all three of us paid $5 for it, each). When we got in, all the tables were filled with dinner crowd. We asked the host when the salsa event would start because we were told that it will start a 9. The host said there was nothing he can do without even apologizing for that. We waited for half an hour (outside the restaurant) and they're still sitting in new dinner guests.

We decide to leave and go to Granada (at least they will be on time for their event). We asked if we can get the $5 valet parking back, because we literally didn't do anything but waiting outside. The valet parking said that they're under different management so they can't refund us. We will not come here again.</review>

Took 10 people for a family celebration and had a wonderful meal! The seafood platter was GREAT! Most of us had beef which was delicious and a couple of people ordered fish and it was very fresh and prepared well. The prices surprised us, be cause most steak houses now have entrees starting at $35 and you can have the same for $20. We had one of every dessert and tasted them all. The service was excellent and it was a busy night. We will definitely be back!!<//Review>

<text>Magnificent!! Driving home to San Diego from Six Flags and decided to pick a random restaurant to eat at in LA to wait for traffic to pass. Prices are a bit on the expensive side but because it was our anniversary and it was named Best Steakhouse by the City of LA, we decided to go for it! Our bill came out to $75 for two glasses of wine, soda pop, appetizer and one entree. We had the Crab legs a la Roberto as our app and it was absolute perfection!! Stupid delicious, love love loved it!!! My entree was two generously sized center cut pork chops cooked to perfect juiciness with tons of flavor with the smallest dollop of mashed potatoes. That was the only downfall, I'm like really? These two huge pork chops with the smallest portion of tatoes, not cool. Wine selection was great, my bf had two diff Cabs and really liked both. The decor was super cute, to the booths and chairs to the glass dividers. Looks like they have a big room for events and such. They were holding dancing classes, salsa and another. This place is just freaking awesome! Even though, parking is scarce even on a Wed night with all those dance classes being held there. Would def come back next time in LA!!<//text>< Response>

One of the best place to go bachata/salsa dancing. Wednesday, Friday and sunday night. Wednesday nights are my favorite cause it's not as crowded and I can dance the night away without bumping into people with every move I make.<//review>

There's no type of security at least going around to make sure everything is ok. It shouldn't have happened and I hope this doesn't happen often.

Dining alone, sitting at an uncomfortable bar counter I was largely ignored for quite a while from the start.

Horrible service for such a highly rated steak house.

The iced tea came in a pretty pilsner glass but no spoon, no sugar, no refill and the straw was too short for the glass.

French onion soup (good) came with the entree.

I ordered a fried seafood platter. The portions were small and not particularly appetizing. The fish did not seem freshly battered but morr like something frozen. It was undercooked and placed on a bed of shredded lettuce not properly drained, soggy on the bottom from the oil it was nasty.  A 1 1/2 teaspoons of tarter sauce didn't cut it either.

Of course, I would have complained had the server checked back with me even once to fill my iced tea before presenting the check. There was no offer of dessert.< /Text>

They have an awesome Happy Hour! Beers on tap, in bottles, well drinks, complimentary finger foods. Highly recommend it. Maria is always an awesome waitress.<//Review>

Food was garbage... for the prices I thought I was coming to a quality restaurant but the cheesy cheap atmosphere and rehydrated mashed potatoes with real potatoes to disguise the fact accompanied by water down drinks totally negated the great music.<//text>

I went with my family for new years celebration and dinner. Ticket indicated dinner will be served at 8:30 pm prompt, so we took an hour to make sure we have a nice table etc. I never knew we already have reserved seats; the whole time we waited was OK just a little pushing with the drinks... We waited so much it was ridiculously, dinner came out at 10:30pm we were so upset and hungry and didn't enjoy much the time and music. Not recommend it for dinner. Dancing okay. Just remember the people going are age 40-60 dressing like 20's and dancing salsa. mostly regulars.</review>

Went there for mothers day and the food was horrible. They had a buffet set up for the entire day. The breakfast sausages were dried and the potatoes tasted old and reheated. The chicken alfredo was disgusting. The chicken they use tastes like it was gone bad. Never going there again.< /Text>

This place was such a dissapointment.  The plates were dirty we waited an hour and a half for food.  Tables that came after us received there food first.  Steak wasn't cooked how I asked.  My Ribeye seemed to be of the worst quality I've seen for how priced it was.  Waitress rarely checked in on us.  Everybody had attitude as if they were doing us a favor by letting us come and sit down.  I will never be coming here again.  First and last.</Text>

<Text>I was in town for business and stopped in for a quiet dinner.  The service was fantastic!  The manager has been working here since the 1960's.  He directed me to order the Crab Roberto appetizer and the big jim Prime rib.  WOW
was a great meal.  I will be back in a couple of months.  You will enjoy the old school feel to this place.<//Text>< gmap_id>

To be honest I expective the meals to be absolutely amazing especially for the price they put it. Sadly the food was ok and one of our parties got the wrong meal but hopefully they can improve on it. The place is beautiful I’ll give them that.< /text>

Our group had reservations at 7:30. They had us waiting for over 2 hours at which twice we were told that they were going to seat us soon but its like they were just telling us that. One host came and said were going to seat you in this room.. nothing.. anther host came and said were going to put you in an upstairs room....we waited and nothing we had to get up and go see and finally they seated us. We got to our table asked for water it had melted ice which eventually was just water..the next time they brought me water it had no ice at all! It looked like it was just sitting out before i got it.  We ordered our food and finally were eating our prime rib at 10:30pm! The dinner salad topped with watery ranch had no flavor..the rolls served seemed dry..it was so late already i didnt even enjoy my food!  The price we paid was not worth it! A very uhappy customer. Not a recommendation to anyone from me!!<//review>

I went with my family for new years celebration and dinner. Ticket indicated dinner will be served at 8:30 pm prompt, so we took an hour to make sure we have a nice table etc. I never knew we already have reserved seats; the whole time we waited was OK just a little pushing with the drinks... We waited so much it was ridiculously, dinner came out at 10:30pm we were so upset and hungry and didn't enjoy much the time and music. Not recommend it for dinner. Dancing okay. Just remember the people going are age 40-60 dressing like 20's and dancing salsa. mostly regulars.< /text>

Went to celebrate the New Year hear with a slew of fellow revelers the band was great and the facility was good.  The meal was okay for a banquet style service because of the crowd.<//Text>

Me and my friend went for a birthday dinner. We did the reservation from their website for 10:30pm. My friend called at 8:56pm to confirm the reservation and see if their was a dress code. When we arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes till 10:30pm, we were told the kitchen closed at 10. That all fine and dandy but why was I able to make a reservation?  Why didnt someone tell us this when we called? When asked these questions the guy couldnt answer. Then when he went to go look up the reservation stated he didnt see one. This wouldn't bother me as much if the restaurant didnt cancel my reservation after my friend and I left. Very upset for wasting my money (ubered to the place) and my time!!<//text>< pictures>

Either way good was decent the environment not my cup of tea as the place is dim, next door music was so loud gave me a headache. It’s a place worth trying, just bring earbuds.

<Text>I went to this restaurant in hope's of a good meal but unfortunately I was very disappointed. Perhaps the kitchen was off its game that night but at those prices they cannot be. While the wait staff was very reasonable I could not recommend going here for a meal, the experience left me very dissatisfied.</Text>< Pics>

I'm very picky when it comes to steakhouse food, but this place had me at door. Every thing from the service to the food was great. It's a little pricey but we'll worth it, I went back after more than 40yrs and I was so suprise, the place had a makeover but the food was unbelievable good. My hats off to the owners especially Albert, he really made us feel at home. So I give stevens double five stars.< /Text>

This place was such a dissapointment.  The plates were dirty we waited an hour and a half for food.  Tables that came after us received there food first.  Steak wasn't cooked how I asked.  My Ribeye seemed to be of the worst quality I've seen for how priced it was.  Waitress rarely checked in on us.  Everybody had attitude as if they were doing us a favor by letting us come and sit down.  I will never be coming here again.  First and last.<//text>

< Review>
First time here at Steven's Steakhouse and everything was perfect. My girl and I came for Valentine's Day and the ambient was excellent. They had a band playing romantic music that fit perfectly with the setting. Our waitress Kassandra was on the ball and made us feel welcomed as soon as we sat down. She was very attentative and always carried a smile on her face. The food was excellent and very delicious. I had the Filet Mignon and Lobster and I definitely recommend it to everyone. This place is great and we will keep coming back.</Review>

Was attendibg a banquet luncheon. Beautifully decorated but food needs a little more attention in seasoning and cooking to order I.e. rare be well done. Also we had to ask for refill of water decanter 5 times before they did so. We were done with dessert when the water finally came. Otherwise worth the low price..< /review>

Good food and good service, the ambiance is nice, a very lively atmosphere, also there is latin dancing music nights. There is also classes for bachata in evenings during week days. Easily reacheable from 5 freeway.< /text>

Instant time travel to the Mad Men era. Ambience, wait staff, food, drinks ... all stuck in the late 60s/early 70s. The menu may be a bit dated, but it's well executed (in a reliable kind of way). Nothing flashy here ...<//Text>

Attended a concert at this place and definitely feel like I was misled and lied to when paying extra for what they advertised as "VIP First Two Rows". I had to wait in line for 45 minutes to get in, is that their definition of VIP, certainly not mine. I was sat about 18 rows from the stage. I asked for my issue to be addressed but everyone, including Dalmari, was running around trying to keep up with the large crowd. That apparently they weren't expecting since they were not prepared for it, and there was no time to address my issue. Food....I've had better steaks at the hamburger joint down the street and definitely no cold, their steak was about 1/4 of an inch thick, more like pork skin, it was dry, overcooked, cold and chewy. Drinks....my whiskey on the rocks came on crushed ice almost like shaved ice....from reading other reviews I see I'm not the only one that feels this way about their concerts. Save your self some time, money and disapointment and stay away.<//Review>

This place is overpriced, and they had no AC on the hottest day in LA in over 26 years. Never coming again. Music was amazing though!< /Review>

They had a band playing romantic music that fit perfectly with the setting. Our waitress Kassandra was on the ball and made us feel welcomed as soon as we sat down. She was very attentative and always carried a smile on her face. The food was excellent and very delicious. I had the Filet Mignon and Lobster and I definitely recommend it to everyone. This place is great and we will keep coming back.<//review>< Pics>

Everything you expect on a  Steakhouse include the price...... it is true about the other reviews pretty much all the waiters and waitresses are old people but they take care of you....<//text>

<Text>It was a group get together of about 75 individuals. What they put on our plate was absolutely disgusting.  The steak was totally unacceptable. If anybody would have seen a picture of this they would not even give it to their dog.  Why in the world anyone would book a group event here is beyond me!</Text>< user>

Do you want to see what 1980s dining in LA looked like?  Steven's Steak House is definitely a place to go back in time.  While most places lose their allure when they are outdated, Steven's seems to have no only resisted change but embraced it.  And, because it has kept true to itself, people still come here.

I ended up at Steven's on a whim during lunch and ordered a burger.  For a place known for it steaks, I though the process of grilling a burger would prove no feat.  Nonetheless, I ended up with a burger that was overly charred and lacking flavor.  Though monstrous in size, satisfaction was not achieved because I simply could not get over the over charred taste.<//Text>

We went for bachata dancing, there's barely enough parking space for the amount of people that go there, unless paying valet parking. Inside is kind of not nice, i was under the impression this was a nice high class place to go dance and maybe eat but didn't even feel like eating there, may be it was the day but i don't think so since it was a Wednesday and I'm pretty sure weekends can get even more chaotic!
The music was just OK, nothing from the other world, there's a bachata room (which is really crowded during bachata nights) and another room for salsa and cumbia (same thing, nothing impressive)
I would rather go to the granada, or even better pch club.
This is not a place I would like to visit any soon (if ever). May be to try the food, but definitely not during those dancing nights. 🖓<//review>

My dad LOVES this place... Practicly lived here taking salsa clases. Started as a robot now he's the best. Celebrate his bday here for the last few years and the food is good always fresh. GREAT ENVIRONMENT and diversity. Love this place. Love watching them dance salsa. Kids welcome too. Just not at night. Oh and the people here are lively including the staff.< /Text>

I came to LA with my husband for his business trip. We just drove around trying to find a good restaurant to fill us up. When we walked in we regconized that we were under dress. The food were pricy (your bill will be around 100+ for 2 people) but taste good though. I don't think they worth the price anyway. The desert I ordered came from frozen product that can buy in any grocery store. They played live Spanish music which was fun, but I wasn't too enjoy since I don't speak Spanish. I would say this place is good for a date night if you want to try something new, but for stopping by for a decent food, I would go somewhere else.</Text>

My dad LOVES this place... Practicly lived here taking salsa clases. Started as a robot now he's the best. Celebrate his bday here for the last few years and the food is good always fresh. GREAT ENVIRONMENT and diversity. Love this place. Love watching them dance salsa. Kids welcome too. Just not at night. Oh and the people here are lively including the staff.</Text>

Good service,  music was loud but festive.  The prime rib was not as good as Lawry's.   Had the bone in 32oz.</Review>

Went early on a Friday evening. The karaoke was so loud and awful. They turned it down but it was still too loud to have a conversation. Food was definitely NOT worth the price either. Not returning.<//review>

<review>Stay away!  This place must write its own reviews.  Do not go here.  The food was not only bad but overpriced and poorly cooked.  I ordered the salmon and was shocked at the size of the plate.  The plate was huge and the salmon was the size of a silver dollar.  The mashed potatoes simply tasted disgusting.  Ok, the meal was bad, how about I drink away my anger?  At $12 plus a glass, well, at least some quality.  Wrong - cheap booze that gave me a headache in the morning.  My bill was over $50.00, so what, if it would have been worth it, but it wasn't.  The price is not really the issue: it's the feeling of being ripped off.< /review><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>117383566383526904870<//UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>chorizo Valencia</Name><gmap_id>0x80c2cfaaa7f54255:0xe7e825bccba9ba3e</gmap_id>< Time>

The DJ was horrible, the music he was playing was so bad at times the dance floor was practically empty,, he played a Mambocha (a Mambocha & Cha Cha Cha Fusion) not one couple on the floor knew how to dance that, then he played a very old Colombian song and he announced on the microphone that he was playing it because he wanted to dance to it. Are you kidding me a DJ's job is not to dance..... Just awful there is no other way to describe it.</Review>

Bad night here. Stained tablecloth, had to change tables because of odor, over cooked filet mignon, waitress had zero personality and zero interest. First and last time here. Should have just went to Applebee's tonight.</Text>

<text>It's as some others say - loud, stodgy and more schizophrenic than eclectic.

Poor beer selection.

What did it for me was the ribeye. This steak was cut in about the worst possible way. Hard, gristled fat along the outside, tons of stringy connective tissue inside. The bone ran through the center like a porterhouse.  Except not a hint of filet.

This steak was 50% fat and 50% brisket.

Held in the sous vide too long, with poorly applied 'char marks'

Mashed potatoes were from a box or a very good imitation thereof. The carrots were nice and nicely done.

I wish I could be back -but it's not worth the risk to me.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The food tasted like plastic we also had to wait till the serving tables that where used for the buffet where cleared then we where sat down on the same table all for 40.0 dollars....if i could give it a 1/2 start i would</review>

<review>You can come here for either dancing or eating their care much about the the food I actually never had a really good meal for the most part it was just mediocre but dancing wise is always been the place to come on a Sunday Friday but they sleep on changing but it's always a good place to come you always find good DJs good music good dancers.</review></record>

Food was not what is worth for I could have cook it myself,,vegetables are counted in porportions ,mashed potato very poor quality taste,im just shock that the food suppose to be high end but is not,I just said to myself is just the brand that sells here .I would never go back and rather enjor olive garden or acapulco,the soup are totally out of this planet onion soup seriously with mozzarella cheese I would rather have a cup noodles soup.the waiter I had name ramon needs to cheer up and receive client with more gratitude at least have a plot like folks how you doing welcome to stevens steak house,but no it was like this guy had an attitude that was not pleasent.good luck to future visitors<//text>

Came here for a business dinner while in LA for work,  recommended by the Doubletree hotel staff. It does not look like a 4 star steakhouse, inside or out. The pictures cover the decor rather well. The servers are in tuxedos. It feels like you just walked into a movie set, a mix between Goodfellas and Casino with a dash of Scarface, along with someone singing karaoke in the background followed by salsa dancing lessons with a live band all in the same room.

They have an extensive menu, going from steakhouse cuts to Italian, American dishes and desserts. Our group of five ordered the porterhouse, the beef tenderloin, I had the mini burgers and two people had the grilled pork chops. The mini burgers plate came with potato wedges; the 3 burgers came topped with smoked Gouda cheese, shredded lettuce, a pickle and mayo on thick baby buns, which i did not try.  I ate only the meat and the cheese with my house cab, which the meat was average and i like Gouda cheese, so overall the burger was edible.

The dessert tray came next.  I ordered a latte and carrot cake. They also have "the best chocolate cake in the world". The latte was well made and came with a setup including a small bowl of whipped cream and a bowl of dark chocolate with cinnamon sticks. The carrot cake was well portioned; it was hearty and loaded with the usual ingredients. You can tell i enjoyed dessert.

We were expecting a quiet dinner; this was a Thursday night and they had karaoke and live salsa band playing and giving dance lessons. They also had a live concert in their event center, Fruko y sus Tesos. I love salsa dancing, so this was right up my alley as far the entertainment went. The crowd and the event center were something else. I bought a ticket for the concert, come to find out they placed all the VIP tables on the dance floor and expected for people to dance on carpet. They were nice enough to give me a refund before the concert started.

Nevertheless, the evening was quite eventful and overall the experience was impressionable. If I come here again, I will bring my dancing shoes and have dessert.<//Text>

<review>We waited about 40 minutes for our food.Ended up packing the dinner to go because we got full on the appetizer and bread.I had to get management in order to get the tab.Bathrooms were dirty and out of paper.The bathrooms upstairs were disgusting.Don't think I'll be back.So many other nicer restaurants out there.😥</review>< Pictures>

Wonderful kind of late 50's early 60's decor and vibe. Very pleasant. All servers wore ties which I found interesting. I think they could have used a couple more servers working the floor but I'm sure they are having the same problems others are having in finding someone willing to work. The feeling of being short staffed came from watching our server fly around trying to cake care of all assigned tables.

The food though was outstanding! Small critiques. The butter was still frozen but the rolls were hot. And the appetizer I ordered was not ready before the entrée was delivered so I ended up canceling the app.< /text>
