I had an appointment for 6pm came in 5:58, there was a line I waited for my turn as on the list I was number 3, @ 6.20 while waiting a guy entered asking how long he’ll be waiting the barber told him he has 2 people ahead he was number 6, when the barber finished with the with a current client she skipped me and went all to number 6 the guy who came asking how long he’ll be waiting, without an explanation she ignored the list, I asked her she claimed we’ll be next, what’s the point of having an appointment if it won’t be followed. I was disappointed.<//text>

Love the convenience for a quick simple cut with a super friendly staff. If your very particular, high maintenance or want that hipster, barber, 8 fade, straight razor experience there tons of alternatives. I get a 2 up top, 1 low and edged up every 3 weeks & stay crispy<//text>

<Review>Channy’s your stylist!

This was the First time using this facility.  She did a great job for a new hair stylist.  I will go back to her next month. She ensured I looked my best, and provided hair tips.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>I should have listened to reviews. Barber didn't know what a fade was and cut my sideburns down to my beard. Now I have to walk around with this until it grows back. Worst experience ever.< /review>< pictures>

<text>It's not that I've ever had a bad haircut from them, some are better than others but when you sell me a service and call it 'unlimited' then tell me I can't get a haircut because you're all booked that's just not acceptable. Either hold spots in reserve specifically for your repeat clients who have subscribed to your service or straight up bump someone who isn't a member. Don't call it unlimited then limit me by saying come back tomorrow because I will stop coming completely.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They were efficient and were able to accommodate my kids at a short notice. I appreciate their efforts in keeping my 4 year sit still quietly while giving a clean haircut. Will probably go there again.<//Review>< pictures>

I had no choice since hair was getting long.  I would gave 5 stars if my barber/stylist was the same on both occasions.  2nd stylist did get close to the 1st haircut.  I guess I can't complain for the price I guess....< /text>

<Review>The price is lower elsewhere but SC is lower than the other hair salon in Westlake. Also the hot towel at the end is why I'm always lulled into a good tip for the stylist. The gals are nice there by the way.<//Review>< GmapID>

I Visited this place yesturday, I was helped by Channy. She is a gem And wow did she do an excellent job at reviving and correcting my hairstyle,. Im literelly in love with my new haircut. She gave me the best haircut i had in a long time ! She is very friendly and professional. She really cared about my hair.

Befor i went to this location my hair was  Chopped uneven and unfinished, I had no hope it could be corrected anytime soon.. im so very happy i visited this location and met Channy now my hair is perfect and i feel great about it

The location itself is bright clean warm and friendly with good vibes and big smiles radiating soon as you walk thru the door.

This place is absolutely the best in the town<//Text>

I will never be going back here. I was a regular here to simply get my undercut shaved, I came back for a cleanup and they tried charging me $20 for something I normally pay $12 for. Insisted I don't pay $12 and had nothing to say when I told them they were losing my business. Terrible customer service.</Text>

<username>Salvador Esmeralda< /username><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Food at Hunan is prepared well and tasty. For lunch their specials are a great deal. Unlike some other Chinese restaurants all of the dishes have a unique flavor with sauces that are varied. Service is quick and well done. Good place to have a big gathering for lunch or dinner. Everything that I have tried on the menu has been good. I always look forward to trying something new with each visit. Great value for your dollar.</Review><Time>1619465158791<//Time>< response>

The food was absolutely delicious. A must-visit for hungry travelers in Fresno. Recommendations: -The lunch platter is well-priced and the restaurants is generally full, so try to reserve a table. The spicy lamb and the orange chicken are must-trys. -For the appetizer plate, you get fried chicken and a spring roll, accompanied by a peanut-sauce salad which is delicious. -You can choose Egg-Drop or Hot and Sour for the soup. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Restaurant is impeccably clean!< /text>

I drove 20 minutes out of my way not realizing how far it was. And I didn’t realize till I was gone that my dish didn’t come with rice?!?!  Who ever heard of Chinese food that doesn’t come with rice or noodles. Apparently everything is a la cart. Which is fine....  if you know!! And you can’t buy one egg roll... they come as six. I cant eat six egg rolls. And to top it all off.... its bland.<//review>

From the minute we walked in you could smell the wonderful aroma from the kitchen. The food arrived hot and fresh. My daughter said it was the freshest vegetables she has ever had in a Chinese restaurant. The Chicken salad came with very nice peanut butter sauce and cold crisp lettuce. The service was fine. Look forward to going back again soon.</Review>

Came for a mid-week lunch. It had been years since I have eaten here since Fresno/Clovis has exploded with great restaurants. But the Hunan has all I ask for: fantastic food, attentive,knowledgeable service and a quiet atmosphere where I can comfortably talk(and be heard) by my partner. Prices are reasonable and menu extensive. Will be back more often!</Review>

Delicious! We called to place our order for pick up and the woman who helped us was super nice and helpful. She offered to call us if our order was ready before the estimated time, which I thought was going above and beyond and she actually did while we were Already on our way. A bit pricey so your order can really add up bit the food and the service makes it worth it. Will def go back</Review>

I’m normally not harsh in my reviews. I try to be fair. But I genuinely feel the food at Hunan is extremely overpriced for the quality. Two of the dishes were not good at all. The Taiwanese salt and pepper chicken was okay. The beef with snow peas and black mushrooms was good. Our walnut shrimp was very dry. The shrimp and walnuts weren’t glazed at all. The fried rice and chow mein had zero flavor and both were greasy. I’m just very disappointed because we don’t expect a large quantity but we do expect quality.<//Review>

<Text>One of the best Chinese restaurants in Fresno. Owner is a chef from China who has earned some merits.  Everything was great except the braised pork was still cold in center.  Food is served traditional style. So no combination plates.</Text>< response>

By far the worst Chinese food I've spent my $$$ on. The overly salted, greasy sauce would not mix with the hard-as-a-board pan fried noodles. All of the sauces: Kung Pao and Mongolian Beef were overly salted that rendered it inedible. The doughy pot stickers and white rice were the only items purchased that were truly edible.  I could have made a better meal...but chose to splurge but was badly punished. 1 star for packaging in new recyclable containers.  Don't waste your $$< /text>

Wow, I have never had food served to me that tasted so horrible. The chicken fried rice was slimy with oil and SALTY. The Mapo Tofu was anything BUT spicy. And the Salt and Pepper fried fish EXTRA EXTRA SALTY. The extra chili sauce was SALTY. And to top it off my husband's Pepsi was FLAT. The waiter, he was very polite and removed the SALTY fish from our bill. Never going back.<//Review>

The food here is always amazing.  The butter cream prawns are a favorite but be warned they are on the sweet side.  They seem to do a lot of takeout business.  The restaurant itself is tucked down a short walk way between two strip centers.<//review>

Got lunch to go. Orange chicken with appetizer platter. Perfectly contrasted flavors. Best Asian dressing on the salad. Yummiest sweet and sour for the egg rolls. Orange chicken was just spicy enough for good flavor. Noodles had a perfect ratio of veggies to noodle with just enough spices Came in non-bpa plastic not styrofoam. My one complaint was my chicken wasnt crunchy by the time I got back to work (not the restaurant's fault). Cant wait to eat here when there's no more covid.<//text>

Those good reviews must be older. I was there today February 15, 2020. I ordered dumplings which were lukewarm. I ordered spicy garlic pork. There was WAY too much cornstarch in it making the dish slimy. Also there was hardly any flavor at all. Will never go back!</Review>

Today I drove about an hour to this restaurant expecting some really good Chinese food that hits the spot. Yelp and google all reflected the restaurant is open for business. Once I got there it was closed until 5pm for a private event. If you are closed outside of a business hour, please have some decency to reflect it online as so. That way customers would not drive here for nothing. If it's a private event I'm sure you had enough notice to reflect your hours online. Not doing so is lazy on administration's part</Review>

< Review>
Extremely disappointed at my purchases this evening for our family dinner: House Special Fried Rice (bland), Singapore Noodle (too much curry on it), Peppered Beef (surprisingly very sweet & full of onions. More onions than beef) & Shredded spork with Tofu (about the only dish that’s ok).  On top of all these, the quantity of the food does not justify the price paid for them. I’m afraid I cannot recommend this restaurant to anybody at all nor will I be going back there again! I’m Chinese as well and that’s why I’m more embarrassed of this.</Review>

I discovered this little hideaway while working in Fresno! I try not to go everyday, but the food is the best! I try something different each time I go and have loved it all.  The only downside,  I live in Orange County and once my assignment is done I'm gonna miss their food! On my way there now!

Reasonably priced

Large tables

<review>Literally the best Chinese/taiwanese food I've had in Fresno so far. The lunch special is absolutely worth it with the amount that's given. There was soup (choice of hot and sour or egg drop), appetizer plate (1 fried chicken wing and an egg roll) , a bowl of salad with peanut dressing, and the entree... All for about 10.50$ after taxes. Way worth it and plenty of leftovers.<//review><Response>None</Response>< time>

This place is hands down the best Chinese food in Fresno!
Everything is ridiculously good and it's quite affordable.
I don't go anywhere else anymore when I want Chinese and it's all the way across town.< /Text>

Made reservation a week earlier, showed up on time to find more than 50 empty seats at 5-6 big EMPTY tables and no table for us and more than 60 people lined up out the door waiting for to go orders and seats in a giant one room mall restaurant with TBAR ceilings and the harsh glare of LED flood lights burning your eyes out.  Clearly the staff was unmanaged and kitchen was overwhelmed with a severasl hour wait.</review>

Okay, I'll be honest. I'm not a huge Chinese food guy. But we were invited to an affair here, so I had no choice. I'll say this for the place: If you don't know it's there, you won't likely find it. It's tucked away back in a corner of a strip mall. That's not an auspicious indication of quality, but they seem to have overcome that location obscurity and have a following I'm told. Service was spotty. Good at first, and then, as they got busier not so good. I don't think it would be fair for me to evaluate the dishes, as I'm not a Chinese afficionado. In our party there were 11 people, and each chose a dish that they wanted and it was served family style. So, I did have the opportunity to sample several dishes. However, that said, I do not eat meat, so that limited my samplings. Prices are not real cheap, but that's to be expected if you're going to expect high quality.< /review>

Best Chinese in California!  Check out the butter cream prawns,  most unique dish they have!  They have a Chinese version and American Chinese version of their menus, so you could be as adventurous as you'd like. Great value and gem in Fresno!< /review>

<review>It took a bit long to get seating for 3 people. We chose to eat family style and went with the cabbage salad. I'm not sure what the sauce was but it was like cabbage marinated in soy sauce. We also went with the hot sour soup and none of us liked it. It had a strange smell we couldn't get past. The closest we got to the description was menudo that hadn't thoroughly been washed. The sweet and sour pork was super good. It was still crispy though coated in sauce. We went with the veggie chow mein and it could've used more vegetables if it was actually meant to be for 3 people. I did like that the food wasnt brought out all together to allow to eat within a good temperature.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>This place never fails to please.  Hot, fresh, consistent, and delicious.  Try the Boiled Fish from the Traditional menu.  Strawberry prawns if you like something on the sweeter side.  While their American menu is superb, I recommend venturing into their Traditional menu since there are so many excellent choices.<//text><Time>1479150750209<//Time><response>None<//response><pictures>None</pictures><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Unfortunately despite the other 1s I tried them out anyway...the food was not fresh. I left my fried rice out overnight and the next morning it was slimy as if someone put cheese in it. I was disgusted and wont be going back. I did do a courtesy and called to tell them. Hopefully they will tighten up their food prep. Its an absolute no for me. People will get sick. The shrimp was undercooked and smelled. The customer service was at least good. Very kind staff for to go.

If you are looking at the picture, I was trying to show the slimy strings coming from my fork. Look under the fork closely you'll see them .</review>

Food was amazing but the service was lacking. Waitress seemed anxious to clear our table despite an almost empty restaurant.< /Review>

<review>It's the best Chinese food in town hands down. If you have a cold: Hot and Sour soup. The food is addictive, the service is really good. They just opened a new restaurant location on the corner of Herndon and Clovis that is just as awesome as the last one. I've been going for years and have not once been disappointed. If you're looking for a great place to take a friend try the week day lunch special! It truly is an amazing place.< /review></record>

<Review>My husband and I were hungry for some good chinese food. After reading the reviews of this place we decided to try it. We are glad we did. The crab Rangoon was excellent. My husband had the wonton soup and said also excellent. He had the Hunan Delight...which was very tasty but spicy hot....I had the Shrimp Lo Mein...very good as well. Our server was very cheerful and on top of her game. We will be back when we are in the area again.</Review>< rate>

It was my first time coming to this buffet. The food was cold. They don't have much of a  salad bar.
What was cool about the buffet there was a store in the side the buffet.< /Review>

The dry cooked gren beans are incredible. So is the orange chicken and pan fried noodles. The wait staff is fast, kind and attentive. We had the small hot and sour soup which could serve six! Portions are huge.</Review>

Strangely, sizzling rice soup came to the table pre-served in little bowls so that we didn't get the sizzle experience, or crunchy rice. The rice came after we were mostly done eating, after two reminders. I was surprised. The two little tea pots ran out quickly and weren't refilled. The restaurant had one other large table and a couple of booths occupied, but only two people serving. That may have been the problem.<//Text>< Pictures>

We have been visiting this restaurant for the last 15 years and have always rated it excellent, however last night we had two of there popular dishes as take out and were very disappointed.  The chow mein noodles were heavy, greasy and stogy and the chicken was grizzly. Our favorite schezuan chicken hot pot was the same and the garlic was intense, not subtle. We added vegetable fried rice which was the only dish that was edible.  I called as I felt they needed to know that the chef was ruining their reputation of serving excellent food. I spoke to a waiter and he apologized and said he would,speak to the chef. No offer of crediting our $35.23.</Text>

My first time here and on a referral from a coworker, we arrived at 4pm for early dinner. This place gas a extensive menu. We ordered the family feast for 2  or more people and it has alot of food included for $20.00 each.  The waiter told us the former chef here moved to San Francisco to open his own restaurant, The Royal feast.  He is an award winning silver medal  chef from China.

This place is a Fresno gem. Great food and great service. Their lunch specials are a steal running at about $11 for soup, salad, chicken appetizer, egg roll, and rice or chow mein. We generally ask to substitute a second egg roll for the chicken appetizer and get half chow mein half fried rice. Their family dinners are also amazing. We love the sizzling rice soup and their strawberry prawns. Mmmmm.</Review>

<Text>Best Chinese food in fresno, hands down. If you try the butter cream prawns and don't melt into your seat, something inside you I s broken... seek therapy. Many dishes have delightfull twists on them that are well thought out and executed flawlessly.

Must try:
Bao Tze
Butter cream prawns
Fried Rice
Chicken Salad
Dry Cooked Green Beans

... hell, everything on the menu.<//Text>< userid>

<Time>1532578848934< /Time><rate>2<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) When this place is just open I almost the first customer to try their food. At that time all the dishes tastes good, nice and clean environment. I take too many pictures and public them on Google map, and write reviews for it. Some dishes taste good, but all American style Chinese food, too sweet for most Chinese guys. In recent year's I always came here to have meals when I pass by Fresno. Years after years, dishes taste change too much, not Change better but to worse I think. Like most restaurant, when their business becomes good they will pay little attention to their service and food. By the way, food is good at first but not now. Recommend two or three years before, but not recommended now.
For most Chinese restaurant they used somecheap tea give free tea for their customers, but right now, they also use cheapest tea but need customer to pay for the worst tested tea. Can't understand what's the manager's idea about it.
For the location is a little bit hard to find, it's located not besides the walkway, need go a little bit further from a ailse in the middle of the parking lot.

When the restaurant first opened, I was almost one of the first people to eat here. At the beginning, the taste and service of the food were still acceptable, but it was in line with American food tastes and was acceptable. You should know that there are not many Chinese food choices in Fresno! I come to eat here almost every year when I pass by, but the last time I feel I can’t eat anymore! The taste of the food is not good, and the service is not good anymore~ For the average Chinese restaurant, the tea made with the cheapest tea is usually provided for free, but there is even a charge now~ If possible, go Try other Chinese restaurants~

餐厅刚刚开业的时候我差不多是第一批来这里吃饭的人之一，刚开始的时候饭菜的味道和服务都还是可以的，但是是符合美国人的饮食口味，也还算可以接受。要知道在Fresno这里没有太多的中餐可以选择！我几乎每年路过这里都会来吃饭，可是最近的一次感觉已经没法吃了！饭菜的味道也不行了，服务也不行了～对于一般的中餐厅来说，那种用最便宜的茶叶泡的茶水通常是免费提供的，但是这里现在竟然还要再收费～如果有可能还是去其他中餐厅试试吧～< /Review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very authentic Chinese food, tastes better than the average domestic restaurant. The amount is also very large, and the price is not expensive. It is so touching that I can eat such a delicious Chinese food in the United States! I wish the boss business is booming! Wonderful! Amazing!

非常正宗的中餐，味道比国内一般餐馆都要好。份量也特别足，价格也不贵。能在美国吃到这么好吃的中餐，太感人了！祝老板生意兴隆！Wonderful! Amazing!<//review><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

This is FAR BETTER than GLENDALE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,  HOLLYWOOD PRESBYTERIAN  AND GLENDALE ADVENTIST. BEST DOCTOR SADRI MOHAMMAD, the nice caring nurses, staff, Alex, Respiratory Tech. .. in short the whole team are awesome.  2 thumbs up. THEY CARE and Take care of you. They make sure you are given best medical attention.  I will with NO DOUBT RECOMMEND THIS URGENT CARE. .. JOB WELL DONE.</Text>

< Review>
My wife had all our 4 kids in this hospital. Its a great hospital the service is great & they really care about you. All the doctors are pros there are no new or trainees in  this hospital at all I really like that. I'm not too sure on what insurance they take but we have medical & it worked fine so I'm sure that they'll take most health insurance. I would definitely recommend this hospital for all couples who are going to have a baby.< /Review>

<text>I don't even know why this hospital is still operational. The lack of communication with the patients, the Dr doesn't follow up with you . Some of the nurses are nice but that's a small amount compared to the rest . I would document everything that occurs for your own record if my any chance you get sent here . I hope a change is done quickly as you can see the reviews are bad . And those that are good might be from the workers families . Even the security team is incompetent and rude .<//text><Rating>1</Rating><time>1499546163748< /time>< Pics>

<review>At first i thought I checked into the Hollywood Beverly Hills Hotel the ambulance had the wring addresd just took a wrong turn since it had the ambiance of the Pink Motel which we know is located in Beverly Hills this hospital rocks with the DC 3 Group.  I can't say enough about those people who work diligently around many of us who are wounded ;Old; falling apart; and dilapidated.  I see it's very frustrating for them as it is and the patient.  It too is very frustrating for us and there is a strong sense of pride & human feel of care giving on a small scale.  However  I believe they're growing just like any other hospital.  I use to come here over 40 years ago as a child and it has that taste of aging wine.  Of Some things i think would be needing immediate changing are the cloth chairs in the waiting room at the entrance. Value vs quality. something more durable out a few details but all in all it's not a bad place to go the food is not great the carpets should be pulled and the other than that you might miss a diamond in the rough.   You may missed it because it's located in downtown China Town.   I've had great luck!   I've had some bad luck so either way I'm still a Alive and the head of the game<//review><userid>102150127404723443437<//userid><username>Terese Yarnell<//username><rating>4<//rating>< gmapID>

The whole security thing is werid but in a way I guess a good thing. They only allow 2 people at a time in the room and the rooms are small and shared by other patients(which if you are like me I like my privacy, then this hospital isn't for you). The cafeteria is in the basement and it's small down there also I went after dinner so didn't get to see how the food looked but they do have a couple of vending machines (keep in mind all food must be consumed in the cafeteria you can't take it to the patients rooms).</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Dr Steven Wang is my PCP and he is awesome. PAMC is well worth the drive from Long Beach.
If your looking for quality medical care , look no further.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>The nurse "Alexis" in the Urgent Care this evening was argumentative when I telephoned after my daughter was released.  I called back after my daughter's condition worsened to ask what should I do. (She had been discharged about a hour ago) She complained about the length of time I had been gone saying is was just 20 minutes, it wasn't.  She argued about my daughters symptoms while she was in the Urgent Care and I just kept trying to get her to answer the question about what to do next.  After several point less comments she finally said well call 911 which I did.  Disappointed because when your child is sick and you have a simple follow-up question the staff should be considerate and compassionate but NEVER argumentative and Rude!  (There was another African American nurse Monique who treated my daughter kindly while we were there the 1 star is for her.)<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I was born dead at this hospital, but then, one of the nurses injected something in me, which gave me life,  and now here I am! Thank you, doctors! May you keep injecting good souls to newborns!</Review>

He had to have a cancerous Tumor removed which was really scary, the surgeon he was assigned was awesome words cannot describe this surgeon he is a amazing human being. He saved my fiancé's life and sincerely showed a since of concern and respect. The registry and staff nurses are great very friendly, helpful and caring. I would highly recommend this hospital for anyone who needs to go there.
They have a lot of good caring employees.< /Text>< Pictures>

They do everything from referrals to providing free transportation from my home to all of my doctors appointments!! It's been a struggle trying to find doctors I trust especially on Medi-Cal aka HealthNet but I truely feel blessed having all my needs met here. Everyone on their staff is supper friendly & helpful!<//review>< Pictures>

And let me tell yah,, im dead scared about my records bieng in the wrong hands now. People becarefull and dont go to this hospital even for a stubid test!!,, or else youll be getting something in the mail from these people saying the same thing they told me,, that my name, social#, and otger info may have been comprimised.

Im ok with it cuz i just dont care if the floor is dirty but she is the patient. They check to see if she is dilated and doesnt even tell us if she has opened or not.

I was born here in 1944, when it was the French Hospital, before it was Pacific Alliance. My mother was born here in 1913 and my daughter was born here in 1965. My grandchildren have been treated here at Pacific Alliance and had surgeries here. In the 102 years this hospital has been serving my family, none of us have had a complaint.</Text>

< Review>
The fake reviews on this pg are pure obvious comedy. We were not happy with the hospital and do not recommend it. I suggest anyone who is unhappy report them and their doctors and nurses to the state. You also have the right to go to LA Care's Monthly board meeting near the 7th St Metro Station, Los Angeles, they are already well aware of my complaint. LA Care is forcing this crummy hospital on the disabled! Google LA Care Board Meeting. My daughter was on their "Care" 1st plan and we were terrorized until we disenrolled her and she just happened to really be sick! My severely autistic daughter was given a double dose SSRIs without my knowledge and the only reason I know that now it because I obtained the records. To make this even more disgusting my daughter had a brain clot called an AVM that had already been diagnosed at Methodist Hospital Arcadia and she was in an induced coma for a week  and we were told at Pacific Alliance she didn't have it. She was at their hospital early in her illness and they failed to do a brain scan on her and she ended up in an induced coma that probably could've been averted. We were told by Keck USC that it eventually could've killed her, yet Pacific Alliances creepy neurosurgeon who didn't even look us in the eye said it was not there and so did one of his creepy colleages. It was taken out at Keck USC because we got her away from them and took her off of Care 1st which according to what I found out online is partly owned by Pacific Alliance. Complain to LA Care about them or your basically complaining to the same phony people!<//Review>

Worse urgent care staff , he was rude and disrespectful towards me. He didn't give his name but he is a dark black man with glasses. He said he hates Americans and non blacks because he is part of Islam. Go figure< /review>

Because women are treated very badly, they don't give the right attention. ... when I go .avia blood all sides. my daughter without cleaning hard 4 hours dirty. almost 3 hours the room uncleaned. And where they had the babies. To clean them. Just a lady. It was argued that she didn't know how to do with so many children. And I was asking why Asian that was the answer ... was that it was almost not personal. ..... if someone is going to light up, please change hospital. Never mind paying .but it's better ..

last night was our first time in this fine restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the excellent service, with the superb  meal and booze and with the comfortable charge. We will definitely come back soon.</Text>

Food was good.  I had the satay and green curry.  Was suprised the curry wasnt served with rice.  The chicken in the curry was over cooked.  The veggies had the texture of frozen veggies added to a hot stock before serving.  AND the dish was missing bamboo shoots.  But the rest of the flavors were good.<//text>

<text>I love the food here! My favorite dishes are the Drunken noodles,
Pad See ew, Pad Thai (VERY flavorful, so depends on your preference but I LOVE it) and definitely the chicken fried rice. I don't know what's in the fried rice but it's so amazing. It's has very simple ingredients but the smoky flavor and onions really compliment each other so well. I dare say it's the best fried rice dish I've ever had. Even my dog loves the fried rice and follows me around every time we buy them. So happy I gave this place a try, I've been a regular ever since the quarantine! Highly recommend everyone to give the food a try. Just FYI, the fried rice that comes with the lunch special is NOT THE SAME as their regular fried rice dish. The fried rice that comes with the lunch special is just a basic fried rice with egg. The one I'm raving about is the regular chicken fried rice entree.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29ab30e61e93f:0xb2d8583311c09c49< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The food wasn't that great. Ordered the Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew. The Pad See Ew was fine, not memorable. The Pad Thai tasted like someone threw a gallon of like juice in it. It was that sour. Some Thai places can do Pad Thai, some can't. This place can't. Avoid the Pad Thai here.

The customer service was okay; they weren't proactive, but if we asked for something they got it for us.

There are no public restrooms here either. Oh well.

They followed proper social distancing protocols at least. They DO DINE IN, at least right now. Every other table was blocked off; socializing after eating was discouraged.

Okay place, however probably wouldn't come here again.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I like their food very much and the place is clean. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because they close from 2:00 until 5:00. I always seem to want to go there at those hours. LOL.<//text>

I've ordered beef with mint leaves and basil and pad prig king with pork and I can't tell the difference because bell peppers are included in the entree!

Food is okay, but a little too oily. It feels like a mom and pop place and the slow service reflects it. It isn't a bad place, but for the price there are many other options in the area where the food is better.< /Text>

The chicken was cold. I asked for no onions and it came with them. Pieces of the chicken where fatty and I supposedly got extra chicken. If so ten pieces equals extra, I'd hate to see the normal amount!< /review>

<review>Marga is not only incredibly welcoming, kind, and humorous but also an absolute professional and so gifted at what she does. She listened carefully to my desires and took time to educate me on what was best for my hair and lifestyle. She seeks to be excellent in all she does! I appreciate her honesty and integrity.  Highly recommended!<//review>< pictures>

HM Hormiguitas Fashion & Beauty Supplies is so incredibly personable! He takes his time to get to know you and your hair styling preferences before he works. He also gives helpful tips on getting your hair to look the way you want it to. My company hired Hector for an event as a work perk and I am so glad they did - he's amazing and I'm so lucky to have had him cut and style my hair.<//Text>

Had no idea they cut hair, I went this passed Friday Oct 23. Unfortunately I forgot to ask the guy for his name but Thank you so much, he helped me out to choose some eyelashes, I’m clueless with eyelashes it was my first time buying them and he really helped me out so much. Great customer service, definitely looking forward to go again to buy more stuff. He is one of those ppl that make you want to go back.<//review>

<review>There is a reason why R&R has such high ratings on google. They honestly spend their time on each customers hair. They are really popular so I do suggest making a reservation first. THEY WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU .< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I used the online ordering and it was 1 footlong for $8.+ and get 1 for 50% off. Then ordered a tuna foot long. Two bags of chips with 2 drinks. When i went to pick up I was charged full price for everything!!! Plus my grandson and I had to hunt for the slices of Turkey in our foot longs. Bread was dry and very disappointed, frustrated. I spoke to the cashier and showed her what i ordered on my phone however she said that there was nothing she could do. To contact subway. Really??? So I’m not going there anymore!!</review>< username>

Great service.    Really good food.  Had an issue with an order.  Perla was such a nice person.   Just took care of the issue.   First issue we have had at this location.    But definitely will be back.    Get the steak and cheese and add ranch and pepperoni and have yourself a Texas cheese steak.  !!!!</Review>

<Text>This is a good Subway and busy a lot of the time but they get you through the line quickly and are very nice. I love all of the sandwiches here and the bread is always fresh and delicious. You can get a good size sandwich for not a lot of money.</Text>< pics>

Over heard a conversation between her and shrek her co worker.... anybody that has common sense knows if you work at a shop,store,etc. You do not park right infront. That's for customers. You need the exercise anyways so instead of parking right infront just park a few blocks away.</text>< Resp>

<text>Just horrible. The owner Must not care about his store.  customer service is just horrible can’t  even use your coupons at this location because they do not know how to use them and they say oh well too bad. Called subway support and no one never got back to me. I’m not eating at this store never again. You need new employees,very rude at their best.< /text>< Rate>

Please do not use the Subway online app at this location.  I did and when I got there I was told they did not receive my order. I showed them the confirmation on my phone and was told to take it up with Corporate Subway.   I basically paid twice for one salad.  I have written to the store, filed a claim with Corporate, and Paypal, however aside from paypal contacting me to tell me the refund was denied...I have heard from no one.  Sounds crazy.  It is basically fraud. Update, Paypal finally gave me my credit.  No contact from Subway.  Use the app here at your own risk!<//text>

<Review>Not ALL Subways are the same.  The service is great and you can make up your mind what you want and don’t want on your special sandwich.  They don’t rush you.  Bread is the best and they never run out of my favorite Parmesan !   Vegetables are fresh and lots of choices.

We drive a little farther to come here.  We have one closer to our house but it just isn’t the same.  Not as friendly, limited choices.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< user>

I usually like this location, it's super close to me so I've gone there a lot and I've never had any real bad customer services however, tonight I went in there and received service that is just unacceptable. When we walked in we were greeted but we had to wait for the employees to finish their conversation before we got any help.
Now this part I'm just confused about, when I asked for the white flatbread that I normally get, she rudely told me that they no longer carry it. I did hear about it being discontinued however it has only been a few months since the last time I had it, not 2 years like the employee stated. My friend and I both recall getting flatbread at this location just months ago and we have gotten it from other locations, that I'm just unsure about, however it didn't call for her being rude.
Lastly the quality of the food straight up sucks, the meatballs are cold, which I know are usually warm or hot even if I don't get the sandwich toasted.<//Review>

The woman was rude. She was asking my preferences but was frowning and seemed annoyed.  She made me feel she was doing me a favor.  The Asian guy came out to help serve customers and everything seems to be better.  Lesson for management:  train staff how to be good customer service employees.  Repeat customers come back because of good customer relations.  I do!< /review>

Went to this subway twice and they didn't have the bread we wanted. I'm a little confused as they mostly make sandwiches that include bread that you "bake" at the store. Won't be going here anytime soon.</review>

It's subway. Not much to say. Flavorful sandwiches but "Wheres the meat?" If you want five stars you are going to have to give more meat and cheese. However if you have them make it intoa salad, its not bad.<//review>

One of the newest Subways up here in Apple Valley. Seating and parking are minimal but the restaurant is new and it's a lot closer than any other subway for me. Apple pay is accepted here (and works). I've done app orders with the Subway app and everything worked very smoothly (don't wait in line, just tell them your name, and you're good). Staff know Spanish and were very patient with my mother in law (from Peru). This subway neighbors a Roundtable (Pizza), a yogurt shop, a fruit juice shop, and a T-Mobile. Starbucks is a minute walk south. There is very limited outdoor seating.<//Text>

The two women working there yesterday were so incredibly rude. My husband asked for something and he said it wrong and they started laughing and speaking in Spanish and looking back at us all rude. I do not care if you speak in spanish but to make fun of us in another language calling us stupid is not okay. We will never give our business there again!</Review>

It is in desperate need of a renovation and upgrade but has everything you expect from this chain of American diner style restaurant. The food is always tasty and the service is overly friendly. Make sure to let them know if you are celebrating a birthday or special occasion, you might get a surprise.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFrk38esDSbKkbZ1rnDfU9zlZmhl1y1iaLSXK2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwYSuOn-pTN4itFoE3h5byvzVhRIR6QsyMeXok=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_1R-IXJW1wC9ONfXWW4cfbuNlu4VUYGaKUzP_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7LORRtT1DE19tzi5symNrrkPp2iCGngB6UoEg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>{'time': 1576344558268, 'text': 'Thanks for writing a review.

The iconic menu together with first class service!

The amount of memorabilia on display here is staggering. And what's even better, there is a giant Eddie Van Halen Frankenstein guitar outside!

Located right at the bottom of the City Walk. Parking is in the garages for the City Walk.<//review>< Pictures>

The ambience is nice and I like the circle seating on different levels and all the artifacts.
Heather, our server, provided good service.  The parking is $10 and easily accessible to Universal City Walk. Really cool place to hang out and bring guest from out of town.
I'm sure I'll be back!<//review>< date>

Second time I have visited this one. Love the place and food is good. Best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had! If there is any down fall it would be the lack of a breakfast option but I was there for lunch!!! Hahahahaha. I will definitely stop back in for some grub next time I'm there. Also they have a good variety of souvenirs so picked up a few while there at a very reasonable price.< /Review>

< Review>
This was my first time eating at a Hard Rock Cafe (at least I think it was) and I was thoroughly satisfied with my visit. We sat at the bar because it was about a 30 minute wait. The bartenders were awesome. They constantly checked on us to see how things were and the drinks & food were delivered quick. I loved the birthday announcements they did throughout the night!< /Review>

Will not go back. Way over priced and service was not good. Paid $5 for seasonal vegetables and this is what they brought me.< /Review>

Food was good. Service was average. My wife had steak salad which she loved. I had legendary burger which was pretty dry...tried to ask for side of mayo, but our waiter spent about 5 minutes talking with another employee with his back to us. He was friendly and nice enough, just not very attentive. A manager ended up coming by later to see how everything was, but by that time we were done with food and just ready to get out of there.</text>

<text>Uniquely themed interior and a menu with a large selection of items. The center bar has a full sized car adorning the top of it! They serve the new and hip impossible burger here.  I've tried it,  it's tasty! They have TV screens that have old music videos playing usually.  It's definitely a high energy place.

There's a shop selling apparel and souvenirs attached to this location.<//text>< GmapID>

Hard Rock Café at Universal CityWalk is a great place to drink, eat and enjoy some music.  I usually sit at the bar and the bartenders are very fast at getting you a drink and taking your order. Definitely a place with fun character to visit.</Review>

<Date>1534952913204< /Date><review>Thought we would try something new and touristy on our quick run down the strip.

I have never eaten at a Hard Rock, hopefully their customer is better at other locations, with the exception of our waiter Jameson who was awesome.

Upon entering the restaurant we had no clue were to go for a table, and the three hostess just stood at the register, finally one asked the number in our party and took off to the table, leaving us 20 feet behind. And had to hustle to catch up!

The food was nothing to great $90 for three burgers and chicken strips and food that lacked flavor.

As mentioned our waiter was great and informative with the area, ideas to take my kids and was on top of our refills, check, boxing etc...

Not a total lose, but just did not live up to the hype</review><user>114359696495691721774< /user>< gmap_id>

I had a last minute birthday here last week and When we came in the front desk staff and the manager were more than a little rude. We just had a few questions but they seemed like they could not be bothered. Even when I tried to tell the host about our needs for an impromptu birthday, I was quickly waved off and told to "try asking my server." I was seriously contemplating leaving and going to JR's but my sever, Don, was able to turn the entire evening around for us! He made the guest of honor (my veteran mother) feel like the bell of the ball! He was very charming, quick and able to think on his feet. He made my mother's birthday one to remember and I truly appreciate it. I have tried to contact the this location twice by phone but I was never able to speak to anyone about it due to long hold times.<//Text>

Large portion sizes and great ambience. The nachos are a must try. I got the ribs and shredded pork combo. It's too heavy for one person. Specials are pricier than the sandwiches but have a great portion size.</text>

The food was good,  and not expensive.  The alcoholic drinks were strong.  The waiter was attentive and helpful.  Not too long of a wait,  maybe 20 minutes or so.  They have gas heaters on the outdoor patio if you prefer to eat outside  and enjoy the live entertainment on City Walk.  I would recommend you eat here if you are visiting Universal Studios since it's right outside the park and less expensive than eating there. The rock and roll memorabilia is pretty awesome and the music is good.  The establishment is clean.  It was a good experience.   Highly recommended.< /text>

Had to wait a little longer then expected, but  can surely say the fod and service was worth it. Their huge burgers are phenomenal, and my wife loved the pasta she ordered (didnt even leave me any!)  We will be back.  Located in the city walk so you can easily make this a fun date place!</Review>

<text>They certainly know how to loose clients.
I went there with family for drinks only (and kids’menu), and place was really empty. Despite of us having a kid and toddler in our party they suggested us seating at the bar. Obviously I said there was no way we could seat there with two kids there.. then they said we should order drinks at the bar and then leave the place to drink outside (at the city walk) at 90 degrees outside.
Almost all dining room (and bar tables) available and they denying seating us and make some business. What a shame.👎👎
They told us they have a “family friendly bar”- really?? Trying to fit a family all at the bar with young kids? I don’t call it friendly.

So margaritaville was our obvious choice.</text>< time>

Jonathan (waiter) was horrible.
Continued to advise my table of of three he busy and couldn’t assist. We didn’t get water until the last 5 minutes of our dinner.

I had to borrow forks and knives from another table and request ketchup three times.

The drinks we ordered were watered down and tasteless.

The manager walked around the entire restaurant dancing and horse playing with the other waiters. No level of professionalism. The manger spoke with every other table around us but proceed to dance around our table when we asked for water and napkins.

The food was okay but the service was horrible and will stop me from visiting at any other location.<//Text>

Hard Rock Cafe was fun and really loud...lol
The ambience is nice and I like the circle seating on different levels and all the artifacts.
The food was really good and plentiful! I also got a free dessert for doing a Yelp Checkin! Those are always cool
Heather, our server, provided good service.  The parking is $10 and easily accessible to Universal City Walk. Really cool place to hang out and bring guest from out of town.
I'm sure I'll be back!</Text>

We paid for priority seating and upon arrival we were told it would be 15 minutes, normal time was 35 minutes according to the host(ess).  We were seated after waiting 57 minutes.  The staff told us they “forgot” about us even though we had a pager.  This place is poorly managed.  Right now the place is 3/4 full and we’re hitting the 50 minute mark waiting for our food.
The staff here should learn to be honest regarding time expectations and communicating with customers.<//text>

My husband and I left Universal around 5pm yesterday. We stopped at this location for a bite to eat. We sat for twenty minutes with no recognization from the staff. Several waiters walked by smiling and ignoring us. The manager even walked by and ignored us. He seemed more concerned about  being the cool guy, showing off his dance moves. He ended up sitting down across from us to work on paperwork, no acknowledgement still that we had been disregarded. We ended up walking out and that even went unnoticed. Ridiculous!<//Review>< name>

<review>Exterior decoration is the only goods thing abouts this restaurant. Took us 35 minutes to receive our food and the food was cold when we received it. An average plate costs $15 and dosent taste worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else. Expected more from this restaurant. Either this chain needs up uo the food quality or they will no longer be relevant with news upcoming generations.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
Great atmosphere, great music. The food is great but nothing that I would die for. I don’t randomly get a craving to eat here, even while visiting the city walk. However, I never regret eating there. It’s up to standard and a great place to eat at least once. If you’re a tourist, this is the place to eat. Local? You can try something else. However, the menu here is probably the most kid friendly for those who deal with picky eaters.<//Review>

Walked up on a very busy Saturday night.
“J” the bartender had us seated, waters and our order taken in 2 minutes.  They were super busy yet he constantly checked on us and had our tummy’s full in :35 minutes.
A relaxing break during a very hectic day.

TIP- rotunda bar is first come first serve if you can. We dined, left saw the same people waiting as we walked in originally.< /Text>

Having been to many Hard Rock cafes, this one was disappointing.  Prices were insane and their menu was basically what you can get at Red Robin but double the price. Not worth going to.  There are plenty of other food options around.< /review>

Same quality of food as always. Descent fast food with large portions. The place is very busy of course. Service was quick and friendly. A place for quick bite with good music vibe.< /Text>

Walked up on a very busy Saturday night.
“J” the bartender had us seated, waters and our order taken in 2 minutes.  They were super busy yet he constantly checked on us and had our tummy’s full in :35 minutes.

I used to like this place, nice place, good food...
Until last time, when the chief of the waiters has treated my girlfriend bad. The guy is extremely stupid. The waiters that are under this guy may be sufering... Poor people!... Take care of you, if you are enjoying your holiday, don't stop in this place, this place may spoil your meal...<//Review>

BE AWARE OF UNDERCOOKED FOOD.

My friends and I decided to eat here after leaving the theme park.  I ordered a simple burger, medium well.  It dripped red when I bit into it.  Being pressed for time and not wanting to ruin our evening, I ate it anyway.  It made me sick for the next few hours and ruined our plans.

I contacted the chain with details about my experience.  The GM sent me an email about having a phone conversation.  I gave him specific information about when to have it.  He never replied.  I sent another email with more options.  No response.

They don't care.  It's a pretty place to get sickening food.</text>

You can never really go wrong when visiting a Hard Rock Cafe, and this one certainly stayed true to that. Excellent service, and fantastic food. We have visited many Hard Rocks over the years and this has turned out to be our favourite. I highly recommend the chicken and ribs combo.<//review>

<Text>I love Hard Rock!
The food is always delicious here and the waiters are very nice!
The atmosphere is just as you would expect it to be in a HR restaurant and there's also a small shop where you can purchase merchandise.
+1 for having veggie burgers!

Excellent flagship location of this rock and roll restaurant and bar. Great music, friendly and eccentric servers, fantastic American classics menu, and a wonderful gift shop and memorabilia everywhere. Prices are a bit steep for most fare, but the atmosphere is great and the experience is worth it. We had a great time here.</text>

I love Hard Rock Cafe! The Hollywood location at Universal City Walk is no exception. My new favorite menu item is the Guinness® Bacon Cheeseburger, which is a burger patty topped with Jameson bacon jam, Guinness cheese sauce, lettuce and tomato. This location ranks right up there with my favorite Hard Rock locations in Seoul, Orlando, and San Antonio.</text>

Tried to make an online reservation, but it would only let us make one for the next day. Arrived later that afternoon & it was not half full yet.

Our server, Tess, was great! Kept her running with tea refills, always returned with a smile. Food was delicious & she almost convinced me to try the cauliflower burger (I know, sounds gross, maybe worth a try next time?).

Store was a little disappointing because the shirts we collect were no longer available (location-unique designs on back). But found another shirt that'd be a decent substitute. Worth returning to if we come this way again.

One recommendation - get the valet parking! Have the restaurant validate it & save several bucks over parking yourselves. Worth it!</review>

I'm somewhat of a Hard Rock fan.  I try to visit one anytime I'm out of town.  I walked in and took a seat at the bar with 0 expectations outside of a meal and a drink.  I got more than that.  The good was good, drinks were good.  But let me tell you service was phenomenal.  I have never experienced bar service like this before.  The bartender was Kimbo Slice and not the late MMA fighter either.  This girl was amazing.  Friendly which should be an automatic for a bartender.   But also extremely attentive.  There was never a moment of trying to find the bartender yell for them try and get their attention.   She was on top of all her customers and made sure they got anything they needed.  I was impressed.  If you go here and sit at the bar and have Kimbo Slice as your bartender, you've hit the jackpot.</Text>

<Text>Waitresses and manager completely ignored us. Something spilled they took the old cup and then left us with the drink all over the table and floor. Never came back to check on us or get us refills.

We talked to the manager she said she would be back shortly with a rag and never came back our way.

Do not recommend.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>101407381793620770047<//user_id>< rating>

<Review>Who knows how good the food is? I came all the way from Texas and planned a trip to Universal Studios so I could go to this location. Well after a long day at Universal and getting to the front door at 4:30pm I read a sign that states: "closed for private party"........forget
about us regular customers. Thanks hard rock. I guess I now know what the hard rock cafe thinks of us.....whenever I travel, I always go to the local hard rock-I won't anymore.

Had to add in response to Amy: we ended up eating at Tony Romas.......our dinner took at least a couple of hours. How long should potential customers have to wait to eat at your restaurant. Maybe, we should all just sit around for how ever long it takes for whatever more important people to complete. Not a fan anymore.< /Review>< user>

I love hard rock , I have been to several, I got out of universal wanting some good food/drinks, when I got there 25 minutes before closing with my party of 8, I was turned away, the website also said closing is at 11 pm ( 1 hour and 25 minutes from what I was expecting) after showing this to the host she still didn’t care, worse hard rock experience I’ve ever had</text>

In the mean time the couple that sat next to us after we finished ordering placed  their order, ate, paid, left and I'm still waiting on the check. I hardly complain as either service is good or food but in this case both were terrible. Other hard rock cafe locations are never like this.<//Review>< Pics>

BEWARE WHEN YOU PAY WITH YOUR CARD,  OUR RESORT CARD HAD BEEN SWIPE TWICE. This case had been resolved by the resort manager while we are still there. OK just imagine if you pay it with your credit card and then you only notice this that you have been charge twice when you already back home?! Check you account as soon as possible while you are still there. Be very careful when you eat there. Food not the best, a bit racist environment I mean the staff not the best either, especially when you want to buy something in there store, they check everything you touch. I'm not a thief or criminal, but they make me feel uncomfortable. "Some people just say something bad about you that they make you look bad in the eyes of the other people."as what one of the ten commandments say, " You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."</review>

< Review>
Visited on Jan 13, 2018. Ordered hickory burger and Washington apple.  my waiter was Ryan. before Ryan arrived we were greeted and taken care of by FACE.  FACE did an excellent job providing us with great service until Ryan arrived and had a great personality.  my burger was good but some of my onion rings were burnt.  the drink was not very strong to my liking.  Ryan was o.k but i would've prefered FACE to be our waiter... the place is awesome with many things to check out inside.  i will definitely go back and see how the food and drinks come out second time around as there may be a different bar tender and cook.  if i could give 3 1/2 stars thats what i would do.< /Review>

We weren't really hungry but wanted to take my niece to a cool spot for her pre 17th b day celebration...the food was good but the service was amazing. Our server Nathan was great. Very friendly and personable. He made the whole experience very memorable and my niece loved her b-day ice cream<//text>

Matthew Burin the Manager, took care of our large party, of mostly all women. He and our Server handled a few minor issues, with ese, and allowed our party to enjoy themselves. The food was fantastic. For our party the most amazing aspect of our visit, was that all of our food came out at the same time. It was nice and hot. Thanks to both of these GREAT people, and the food, we all had a great time.

Thank you again.</text>

Haven't been to a Hard Rock Cafe for 20 or 30 years...
Great food, great waitress, super ambiance...
One plus, the barman recognized me from Facebook and offered us a round of drinks...</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Universal Studios Entrance in Los Angeles City Studio Universal Studios Studio in Hard Rock Café located in the downtown area. When I visit, I always try to eat it, but the size is overwhelmingly big and it is very delicious. The fries provided are smooth and delicious. It is rather a lot to eat alone. And the BBQ fork sandwich menu also contains pork like BBQ sauce in hamburger bread. It is juicy and very delicious. The staff is friendly, the indoor space is also quite spacious and pleasant, and it plays songs mainly in the rock. Souvenirs and logo shirts are also sold on the inside.

(Original)
LA시 유니버설 스튜디오 입구 City Walk 상가지역에 위치한 하드롹카페의 유니버설 스튜디오지점. 방문하면 항상 폭립을 시켜 먹는데, 일단 크기가 압도적으로 크며, 너무 너무 맛있다. 같이 제공되는 프라이도 부드럽고 맛있다. 혼자 먹기에는 다소 양이 많은편이다. 그리고 BBQ포크 샌드위치 메뉴도 햄버거 빵안에 BBQ소스로 버무린 돼지고기가 패티처럼 들어있는데 쥬시하고 너무 맛있다. 직원들도 친절하고 실내공간도 꽤 넓고 쾌적하며 Rock위주로 노래도 틀어준다. 내부 한쪽에 기념품과 로고셔츠도 판매한다.< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Anyone who has been to Universal Studios must also eat in hard rock.
The burger is the best I've ever had and the service is incredibly nice. It was my third time there and I still find it incredible. It is simply an experience to eat there. You should also take a photo from the balcony.
The rotating car in the middle and all the accessories are of course a highlight.
There is a shop directly in the restaurant where you can buy sweaters and t-shirts.
I can only recommend this restaurant!

(Original)
Wer in den Universal Studios war muss auch unbedingt im Hardrock essen gehen.
Der Burger ist der beste, welchen ich je gegessen habe und die Bedienung ist unfassbar nett. Ich war nun schon das dritte mal dort und finde es immer noch unglaublich. Es ist einfach ein Erlebnis dort zu essen. Man sollte auch unbedingt ein Foto vom Balkon aus machen.
Das drehende Auto in der Mitte und die ganzen Accessoires sind natürlich ein Highlight.
Direkt im Restaurant findet sich auf einer Seite ein Shop, wo man Pullover und tshirts kaufen kann.
Ich kann dieses Restaurant nur empfehlen!</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The inside and outside of the store were very nice. The car in the store was cool! The outside Van Helen guitar was also wonderful!
BGM wanted a more rock song ~~
I feel like I can enjoy various things outside rather than inside the store.
It is impressive that a big car was spinning around in the store. I felt the seats in the store were small. . . If the table was two people, I was guided to a small table and it seemed that the table was full just by asking for a hamburger, so it was still nice if I could eat relaxedly
The atmosphere was good.

(Original)
店内も外もとても素敵でした。店内の車かっこよかった！外のヴァンヘーレンのギターもステキでした！
BGMはもっとロックな曲がよかったなぁ〜〜
店内というより、外でいろいろ楽しめるような気がします。
店内は大きな車がぐるぐる回ってたのが、印象的です。店内の席が細々としてた気がしました。。。テーブルも二人だと小さなテーブルに案内されたりして、ハンバーガー頼んだだけでテーブルがいっぱいいっぱいなる感じだったので、ゆったり食べれたらまだよかったかなー
雰囲気はよかったです。<//Review>

(Translated by Google) What food! What a service! A shell of a place!
We loved every moment we sat here, although there is some waiting but it is totally worth the time and money.
Great food with excellent service! We enjoyed this place a lot. They have large dishes at affordable prices compared to what you get. Everything looks clean and the food is very tasty. You can check out the photos ... We also went to the cinemas after this place, was great!

(Original)
איזה אוכל! איזה שירות! פגז של מקום!
אהבנו כל רגע שישבנו פה, אמנם יש קצת המתנה אבל זה לגמרי שווה את הזמן והכסף.

(Translated by Google) Again a great Hard Rock Café .... Great location great service ...
At Hard Rock I will never be disappointed, the Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood is again a great and nice highlight! Great food (like everywhere at HRC) and great service. It's just great. Coupled with great music memorabilia and everything in a great atmosphere and location.

The highlight outside is the gigantic Frankenstrat guitar by Eddie Van Halen ...

You just feel comfortable!

EXCELLENT!

(Translated by Google) Nice. Good attention. But the food cold, rich everything but cold. Obviously I asked for it to be heated, but it is not pleasant

Wow. This location is way too hidden, the lady that helped us was great, very friendly, talkative and genuinely enthusiastic about giving great service. I would absolutely return just because the great attitude. Ice cream portions were excellent.  Good job to this Cold Stone location. Only recommendation is put a banner or flag outside, window tint makes the place dark and look closed.<//text>

Waited in there 20 minute 1 customer per entry covid line outside to go in and for them to tell me they have no more milk for milkshakes. They should at least put a sign outside or keep well stocked.</text>

Need to change closing hours. Google says close at 10pm on Sunday. Drive all the way from the other side of Riverside for the lady to say they're closed even though there were two  people in there still ordering at 9:45.< /text>

Horrible service! They always wrap their brownies early in the evening to say they can’t serve it?!?!? even though i went to the store 1.5hrs before they closed ! It’s like they are trying to turn away customers in the evening.<//Text>

This is now my 3rd experience of the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with! Emily is the rudest worker not only at this location but EVER! Its to the point that I can't even call and get the managers number to contact him/her and have her FIRED because no one even answers the phone! At this point, if I see her working there still, I will just take my family to another location no matter how far it is, just to not experience such sarcastic human interaction from yet another teenager at this location! Please learn some manners and personal respect!<//Review>

<Review>The workers they have are very rude. Emily was the worker that helped me.Worse experience at a cold stone I've ever had. What happened to smiles and customer service?? I had rewards and she didnt know anything when I asked how to redeem them. Just blew me off and helped the next customer.  I wont be going back!! Need to hire people who treat customers right.<//Review>< Pics>

Great customer service! 😊

the only default is they are understaffed, but that is not the employees fault. They do the best they can!

<Review>I have been going to this coldstone for the past 2 years and I have never had such horrible service in my life. I had a young Hispanic girl make my ice cream. She put the wrong toppings on and when I asked she lied about it because she didn't want to make a new one. Then she over charges me. I asked the other blonde how much my ice cream is usually and she tells me I was overcharged. The Hispanic girl then comes back and says "I only overcharged her 20 cents" then walks away. No sorry, no it won't happen again. The other blonde doesn't even bother giving me my money back. After I leave it taste my ice cream and it doesn't have any of the toppings I asked for at all. I ended up throwing it away. I will never go back again. They have lost a customer for good.< /Review>< Response>

<user>118207429534299636351</user>< review>
2 times I went there 1 hour and 1 1/2 hours after the posted opening and they were still closed and once I looked inside only to see 2 female employee's sitting at a table chatting away. The next 2 times I went there one month apart and I stood in line for several minutes only to find out there blender is broken. So in a lil over one month time they have been unable to replace the blender? Today (the 2nd time) I was told that the blender goes in and out.

They seriously need to replace the blender and post a sign that the blender is broken until it is replaced. 4 times this summer I have walked away empty handed and it will never happen again because I will not be returning. There is a Baskin Robbins, Golden Spoon, and 2 Starbucks in the area with much better service!</review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This may be the best sushi I have eaten since living in California. We had the pizza roll which was good, but then we had the Mango something? A-go-go? I cannot remember the name but when you get there and look at the menu, you will recognize it. It was FABULOUS. So fresh and perfect combination of ingredients. Then, we had the lime & tuna? Again, I don't remember the name but when you look at the menu you will recognize it. Somehow it beat the first one! I cannot wait to go back.< /text>< response>

Wow we had an absolutely horrible experience here. Placed an order on the phone, she said it would be 45 minutes. Got there at the 40 minute mark, and when I gave my name she seemed flustered and said it would be 10 minutes until it was ready. That was fine, we didn’t mind waiting. So we sat at the counter, 10 minutes came and went. But she never apologized, never offered us water or anything, wouldn’t make eye contact with us, never updated us on the time, didn’t even have us pay ahead of time to save time. There were only 2 occupied tables at the time. We waited 25 minutes until it was ready, and she still never apologized. I will never return, I was absolutely livid at the service.<//text>

<Review>This one is a bit out of the way from most places I do find myself going, but the sushi was great - service was excellent. A bit cold temperature inside *(maybe intentionally to keep things there fresh) and space seems kinda industrial inside. When compared to the Tabu in Vista or in Carmel Mountain, its a completely different Sushi experience - but please decide for yourself!</Review>< GmapID>

I love love love Tabu and am so excited they are opening in Encinitas soon. The Del Mar location is were I currently go. The food is off the charts delicious. The menu is huge and the options for different kinds of sushi rolls is endless. This is by far my most favorite place to go for sushi.< /Text>

<Text>I ate at this place this past Sunday. Really fast service! Manager greeted us right when we walked in and was very friendly. Our server Kameron was very nice as well. Shoutout to Chef Rani for the amazing Sautéed Shrimp (appetizer). Highly recommend this place!!</Text>< pictures>

Compliments to the chef - the sushi here was awesome.  It may just be because sushi in the Midwest isn't this fresh, but I had no complaints about this place after a long day's work.  Friendly staff and very relaxing experience.</Text>

There was no one in the restaurant and to top it all off we waited 40 minutes for our food which never came. So we paid for our wine and left. They did not bother to refill drinks. They were not that friendly and they seemed to be inconvenienced by us asking for more water. I will never recommend this place to anyone.</Text>< Pictures>

We showed up here at 5:30pm on a Friday, and we're the only ones here! The wait staff was firendly, we sat at the bar. The Sushi chef was also very friendly, and made our food promptly when we ordered. The fish was fantastic! some of the rolls we're unusual, but we tried two and we're pleasently surprised! I would have preferred fresh mango slices to the mango "salsa" on the mango tango, but everything else was quite good! Bonus: they had Asahi on tap!< /Review>

The place was quite nicely decorated, very open and friendly atmosphere. Had a great friend serving our table, his name is Moe and he was very friendly and gave lot of helpful suggestions.

We ordered, crunchy shrimp, California roll, chicken ramen, dumplings.
Everything was edible, nothing more.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1498240783353, 'text': "Thanks for trying us out a while ago, Pradeep.

<Time>1449510258398< /Time><rate>4</rate><Review>You might think Sushi in Del Mar is gonna be a costly endeavor and that you might be able to save some time and money by going a little further north to Solana, Encinitas or Carlsbad and in general you'd be right, but this unassuming spot barely looks like a sushi spot from the outside and actually that rusty gate from the grocery store next door probably scare people off. It's awesome to come here when it's slow, you get super fast and amazing food and during daytime they have a HH that's killer on the deals. Kai roll, sushi burrito, philly.

They serve a ton of regulars and most of the staff will remember you if you come in a lot. The service is great, but most of all from the chef's with their great flavor profiles, knife skills and recommendations.

They have some major price jumps between standard rolls and premium as well as for their MP items like Uni, Toro, etc. The salad pricing like wakame is a bit high. If you don't mind getting certain rolls the HH can be as inexpensive as any place around, but their quality will keep you coming back regardless of the price.

Found out about this place as they also own Nozomi in Carlsbad, another diamond in the rough. Urban, Balance and Flower Hill have brought a lot more attention to this side of the 5.

Their salmon tends to be firm, while their tuna I found soft. They use a lot of jalapeno, cream cheese and sriracha in their rolls. They perfectly don't over fry their shrimp, the unagi sauce is a bit of an overload and really sweet. I always ask to go easy on the crunchies if any at all.

I don't like the word fusion and you'll see it in the rest of their menu being that it's pretty limited on the back end, but the front chefs are great.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

My wife and I ordered teriyaki vegetables and sushi to-go and were relatively disappointed with our meal. The service we experienced was good and we received our to-go order quickly, but the sushi just wasn't that great. The teriyaki vegetables were amazing and we really enjoyed those, but the two sushi rolls we ordered were just mediocre. Part of our issue was that the soy sauce which was served with our sushi (in little to-go packets) was incredibly salty. Disgustingly so. It completely overwhelmed the flavor of the sushi, the ginger, and the wasabi sauce. We'll definitely be back for some more teriyaki vegetables and chicken, but next time we'll probably skip the sushi. On a side note the prices for a $$ location weren't too bad. You can purchase sushi rolls there for as low as $5.50-ish (for an 8-piece roll). More expensive rolls can run up to $15 for a 10 piece roll. The excellent teriyaki vegetables were $12 for a substantial serving.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) What to say, what to say ...
We were 7 plus 2 children and yet all the service was impeccable. Smiling, cordial, quick. They would come back often to see if everything was okay.

Let's talk about dishes now, it's consistent, it's big, it's tasty! We are served platters with 10 original makis [instead of 6 in France], each one better than the next.

I'll just say their sake is average, but out of that it's really good.

The restaurant is large and therefore can accommodate a lot of customers, but the tables are kept widely spaced out so it's nice not to be crowded. It also allows you to get along without having to listen to what the next table is saying.

(Original)
Que dire, que dire...
Nous étions 7 plus 2 enfants et pourtant tout le service a été impeccable. Souriant, cordial, rapide. Ils repassaient souvent or voir si tout allait bien.

Parlons plats maintenant, c'est consistant, c'est gros, c'est goûtu! On nous sert des plateaux avec 10 originaux makis [au lieu de 6 en France] tous plus bons les uns que les autres.

Je dirai juste que leur saké est moyen, mais sorti de ça, c'est vraiment bon.

Le restaurant est grand et peut donc accueillir beaucoup de clients, mais les tables restent très espacées, donc c'est agréable de ne pas être serré. Ça permet aussi de s'entendre sans avoir à écouter ce que dit la table d'à côté.< /Text>

It was very beautiful 😍 The courts over look the city and has a gorgeous view of the ocean and alcatraz. At night it even more stunning. Sadly there is no lights to play at night however in the day there are 4 courts and a wall, plus a basketball court. It is very easy to lose balls here, once gone you probably will never get them back so bring lots of balls.</text>

best view in the city. from the courts you can see golden gate bridge, sailboats. the ocean from maybe 1/3 or 1/2 of the perimeter. walk a block out and you get great views of alcatraz and coit tower. honestly it’s such a privilege to play tennis here, these courts are a gem ugh!!!!</review>

Each court was full on a Saturday morning with two groups waiting. My friend said it best: "This feels like a sports video game backdrop." The view is 10/5 stars. I'm only rating it a 4 as the nets were a bit worn and there was no net on one of the basketball hoops. I will be returning to play :) 🎾<//Review>

<text>Let me start by saying I am NOT a tennis player...However, this is one of the BEST locations in SF to watch the Blue Angels show during Fleet Week.  If you don't have roof access in Russian Hill or the Marina, consider making the trek to these tennis courts to watch the show.  There are a lot of locals who go every year to watch the show.  The best part is you don't need to deal with the crowds down on the Wharf!</text>< pics>

Beautiful place to play tennis - panoramic views of the Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz.  Cable cars passing by clang their bells as you play, which is kind of charming. Courts are in great shape.< /text>

<Review>On a clear day Alice Marble has some of the best views in San Francisco and it's a great location to play tennis! On weekdays from late morning to early afternoon it's always easy to get a court. There are 2 singles courts and 2 doubles courts.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Probably the best view over the city and Golden Gate bridge in this part of the city. Features 4 tennis courts, a tennis pratice wall and 2 basket ball hoops. Playing here is free, but you might have to wait a bit for a vacancy.

If you just want to enjoy the view and take a picture, you can usually sneak in if it's ok with the people playing.< /Text>< Pics>

Amazing place to play tennis. Wish there was a sign up on weekends so the turnover of courts could be smoother. Not everyone abides by the recommended 30-40 mins of play when there's people waiting.< /Text>

<text>These tennis courts might have the best views in San Francisco, hands down.  If you want to play doubles, play in the center courts because the courts on the sides don't have painted alleys.  The surface of the courts is not all that great, there are tons of "dead spots" that are really annoying.  Next to the courts is a practice wall and basketball courts, so expect a reasonable amount of noise.<//text>< Pictures>

Great customer service!!
They repaired my PS4 fan & after a few days still running great & very quiet.
They offer a 1 year warranty as well. I definitely recommend taking your game consoles If you have a noisy fan or issues with console.< /text>

I went in with my dad to get his phone fixed because it wasn't charging due to so much build up in the charger port I  thought there was no way it could be fixed. The owner I believe Jacob was so sweet amazing and helpful. It was the best customer service I have seen in my 26 years of living. Thank you for that.< /Review>< Pictures>

We took my sons phone in to get the screen and LCD replaced. Jacob was very kind and had it fixed in 30 mins for a reasonable price. We were so impressed with how quick it was fixed. He was also very nice!<//Text>

<review>Gregory was very fast and knowledgeable on the repair. Answered all my questions and showed, where the possible problems with microphones could be coming from on my iPhone 7. The battery repair was very quick, and the price was the same as sending it to Apple for repair. Very good service and I would recommend them for anyone needing phone repair.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Jacob steered me from from doing an unnecessary charger port replacement and cleaned it instead and was able to sell me a the proper phone case for doing construction so my port will stay clean and free of debris. All in about 15 minutes.< /Review>< name>

Gregory was awesome! He fixed my shattered phone screen and was able to answer all of my questions about the screen, process and store products. He had my phone fixed within an hour and I wouldn't hesitate to go to him for any future repairs!< /Text>

We sent in our iPad for repair and over a month and a half later they returned it. The iPad kept coming apart with their fix . We took it in to get our refund after the second try of putting more glue to hold the screen didn’t work and they returned our iPad with no screen because they had thrown the screen away. They mentioned that they don’t keep screens and they dispose of them but that is a lie because I had them take my phone before and when their replacement screen didn’t work they replaced it with my old screen and returned it. Not to mention that it took us over 2 months to exchange a wrong size case because every time we went in they said that a certain person had to be in and they couldn’t do it. Then when we did talk to this person he made it sound like anyone could do it .

IF IT HELPS ANYONE.
If you take an iPad your  are looking at over $500 cost of service and about 2 month wait. If they refund you they refund you only the parts but not the work and you don’t get the parts that they took out back.</Text>

<text>RepairALL did a great job fixing my phone screen. It only took one hour and the gal who helped me was very clear and helpful in the process. You can make an appointment online and they get an estimate as well. I really appreciate the transparency and definitely would go back again.

<Review>Manager who was working there stayed after hours to help me fix the screen on my phone. Even though it was more complicated because of the phone situation they were a very nice place to go and they went above and beyond to help me out.

DO NOT GO HERE! My husband had a bad experience with this place a year ago but when my phone got wet and suddenly stopped working I decided to give them another try. For $200 they took my phone apart and repaired the water damage… a couple of weeks later my phone completely came apart and they refused to cover it and tried to charge me another $200 to put the phone back together. The phone had never come apart or been taken apart prior to me having it serviced here so it was clearly due to their handing of the phone that this issue occurred. Terrible customer service!<//Text>

Terrible service, I took my laptop only to have the damaged screen repaired 1 month ago they told me that in 2 weeks the part would arrive and they would talk to me, they did not speak to me I had to call after 3 weeks and they told me it would arrive until more than 1 week that There are problems with UPS (who has problems with UPS here in Turlock? I think nobody, they are very active), after that more than 1 week yesterday Friday the part would arrive according to, today I went and they told me that the part did not arrive and They do not even speak to notify, I ask them for the money back and the manager tells me that he cannot process that, that only the manager (the one who is never there), according to him will be tomorrow from 11 to 7 pm, let's wait. Taking into account that I previously told him that he urged me to make sure that he could do it and he said yes. That laptop is for work and it is not fair that because of these people's ideas one is losing. Horrible service.<//text>

After putting my iPhone 7 Plus through 20 minutes of the wash cycle with my bedding, I walked in and was helped immediately with an evaluation and a recommendation on how best to proceed. My phone was dried and the screen was replaced and is as good as new.  All in under an hour and for $89.99.  Sure beats having to replace the phone!</Text>

I went to get a rear camera replacement and I ended up having to go back twice because they gave me a used camera and so I had to return to get it fixed again because as soon as I left it was super dim  so I came back and sat outside waiting and he just played video games the whole time!!! Horrible service. My camera is still not fixed.<//text>

employees are really rude and they don't take the responsibility for their mistakes. we took our device to their store and paid the deposit, not even they broke the device completely, they didn't even return our deposit back and took the money. I do Not ever recommend this store to anyone. Each employee would give you different answers and excuses just to cover up their mistakes, and they treat their costumers so bad . worst experience ever.<//review>

<Time>1561490107972< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Unfortunately I had dropped my phone and cracked the screen in multiple spots. I need my phone for work so I had  to replace immediately. Went to are local phone carrier and dropped nine hundred bucks on a new phone to get back up and running. As I walked out the door a gentleman was kind enough to tell me about repair all. It was actually right across the street from where I was. So I walked over and showed them my phone. The employee looked at it and said no problem can fix it in about an hour and cost 250.00 dollars. So I left it there and sure enough they repaired it like brand new. Now I have a back up phone for just in case moments. I do wished the gentleman had of spoken up a little sooner but that's ok. Store super clean, a lot of merchandise on the walls and all of staff very  professional and  knowledgeable. They made a customer for life that day.< /text>< pics>

They installed a new camera lens to my s9+ and while they where able to replace the lens, the left a fair amount of dust underneath the new one. They also left a large bubble under the glass on the back of my phone that ruins the appearance of the phone. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is that they where able to fix it very fast, but I wish they would of taken longer and done a quality job that doesn't leave me looking for a new repair center.

An Update
I was contacted over the phone by the person who had done the repair to my phone offering to replace the back glass and lens of my phone again, and to fix what had been messed up in the original repair. he told me that he would order the parts and give me a call when they had arrived so i could come down and have it replaced again. that was about three weeks ago, and i have still not heard back from them.</Text>

I needed a screen protector for my new phone. I chose the RepairAll store near me. Both people in the store were welcoming & helpful. I was given options of type & warranties on products. My protector was installed in the store & I left knowing that I would return for future phone needs.</review>

Beware of leaving your electronics with them.

Have to change my review. They had my iPad for a very long time. Over 6 months trying to repair it. They said they would call when it was finished and never called me. I ended up calling them multiple times and they said they had it and were working on finishing it. The store said they would call when it was finished. Never called again and I ended up calling again and that’s when they said they sent it to the warehouse. After calling and leaving multiple messages and emails at the warehouse they never called back or responded to my emails. No responses or anything. So now I am out and iPad and the store and warehouse won’t do anything for me. Last time I ever go there.</review>

The work is good but the part was late. I was told they’d call when the part was in.  They told me Tuesday, then Wednesday, then Thursday. I called on Friday because I had not heard from them. They said the part had come in on Thursday but they didn’t have time to call me. It took 8 days to complete my order. When I brought in the phone on Friday, they repaired it in about 2 hours. However, they charged me more than they originally quoted. Their product has a lifetime guarantee for part defect. It doesn’t cover damages caused by the user. Their sense of urgency is lacking but their work is acceptable.< /review>

If your looking for affordable, fast, awesome customer service, this is the place for you! Very affordable prices, and super fast process to get your phone repaired.. I was there for only a hour at most, to fix my shattered phone screen!  I wish I caught the guys name that helped me yesterday afternoon, because wow talk about great customer service!! With it being my first time in the repair shop, the gentleman made my younger brother and I feel comfortable and right at home. Working in the costumer service industry for several years myself one of the main things was always getting to know my costumers and make that personal connection to bring them back in the future!! Because of this awesome mans excellent costumer service, they now have my business for all future repair needs!! 😊<//text>

<Text>Quick service with KNOWLEDGE to back it up! Even with my sticker shock , iPhone X needed full screen replacement staff was able to completely AND with expertise explain the details of the cost to me including their labor. I appreciated that beyond belief and will return with any issues my electronics have.  It also should be noted that service was completed ON TIME when they stated it would be.</Text></record>

Very unhappy with the experience. they told me it would be 3 to 5 days to ship in two parts I needed for my phone, one to fix my charging port and the other to fix my headphone jack. and ended up taking almost a month just to get the parts in and all the while when I would call them they would tell me that they would call me back once they had found out where the part was and out of the four people I talked to only one ever actually called me back. the only good thing I do have to say is when they finally did get the parts, they did it in less than 2 hours although they also didn't call me when it was finished and they gave me $10 off as a constellation. I do not recommend this company in any way shape or form.< /review>

Terrible communication. Not a single person knew what was going on with my computer that i had being repaired or who was working on it. When i would call to check in the girls answering the phone sounded like i was bothering them and had know idea how to speak to someone with professionalism and would give me incorrect updates. Less then pleasant experience to say the least.</Review>

I dropped my phone off and went to get some lunch at a fast food place across the street and when I came back it was done, they even put on a new screen protector, all in all I wouldn’t hesitate to use repairALL again< /review><name>Amy Kisner<//name>< gmap_id>

Was told when I explained the problem that it was probably a certain part. Okay. Was told it would take x amount of time to get part. I paid for it. Several days after the allotted time, I had to call. Was told he hadn't had time to go through box. Would call me back. Did not call me back. I called a couple days later..Talked to someone else. Now told it was in. Brought phone in.  Told to come back in allotted time. I did, giving him extra time. I was handed my phone. I asked if he had checked to see if the problem had been solved.  No, he had not. I handed the phone back. He checked. Nope. Problem not solved. I have no idea if new part even installed as when I asked for old part, told no. He also admitted when asked if he had checked the charging port while inside the phone which he was supposed to do.. Nope. Said he didn't have time then to call someone who might know about original problem. Would call me. Nope, he didn't. I had to call back. Went in again because he still needed to check the charging port. Came back at allotted time and still had to wait. No problems solved. I won't be coming back.  It's obvious that the administration is not willing to hire someone to solely work in the back to repair phones. Clerks are more interested in commissions. My phone should not be repaired on the front desk along with parts from other open phones, but clerks won't work on them in the back for fear of loosing commissions.  Shame on the corporate decision to not hire real repair people AND clerks AND make salaries equitable.  I will tell friends and family to steer clear of your business.<//Text>

I came in with a phone that said, no service. Instead of taking my phone and promising me they could fix it.. they told me it was probably something internally or my service. Needless to say I Gave  up on my 6s and bought a new phone. I only bought a case for my new phone at their store. I knew I could get the same case cheaper on amazon, but I wanted to support their business. Talking to these young men about repairs and other fixes.. made me realize they know their stuff, and they seem to be very honest in what they can and can not do. I would recommend their store.< /text>

<text>My brother asked me to take his screen in to fix it and this was the first place I thought of! I've never been before, but I'm so glad I walked in! I called around to compare some prices but was able to join the free VIP club for $10 off and liked the page on facebook for even sweeter discount! Service was amazing, I didn't get her name but rep who helped me was very sweet and the screen was fixed in the exact time she said it would be! Thank you thank you!! I will definitely come back if I need any other repairs done!!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Was told could get my phone fixed there. Given a card with money off got there and was way cheaper and very quickly done fixing my phone. They were nice  to talk with at the same time he worked on my phone and even gave me back coupon so  my granddaughter’s phone could be brought in and fixed with money off !  It’s a nice little shop with lots to look at and great prices to possibly buy more in the future. Great location! Thank you<//text>

The lady was very informative and efficient.   She explained the repairs and made sure I was aware of the process.   I was also able to see her deal with a prior customer and she was definataly all about customer service and making things right for them.   So far my experience with this business have been very positive.  I'll be going back next week for the actual repair when the part arrives.<//review>

<Text>Fast and efficient service!   They accomodated me to replace a broken port where you charge on iphone 8 at almost closing time. They have the part available so I didn’t have to wait too long. I felt paralyze at first because I thought I won’t be able to use my phone because it’s running out of power.   I felt so relieve!  Thank you so much!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>This was the first place I called, and immediately over the phone I felt the owner was very genuine in wanting to help, and honest with how they price. So I didn't need to call anywhere else.
I came in the next day and my phone was fixed within the hour, already having a special part on hand in the store. I really appreciated the help. Excellent customer service!</Text>< Date>

Turlock needed a shop with kind and knowledgeable staff that are ready to assist with ALL our electronic issues.  Repair All makes sure you are satisfied when you leave and informs you that they are there to help!  I will be returning with other electronic repairs. The technician and manager were both great to work with!  Many thanks!<//Review>

OH MY GOD!  Incredibly STUPENDOUS SERVICE!  She did an excellent job of repairing my iPhone!  This was the third time I’ve had it repaired and was much faster than batteries/bulbs was.  Price is similar but price isn’t always the defining element of everything.  I know it sounds silly but I knew she cared about what she was doing.  It’s just a phone but it isn’t just a phone.  Its MY phone and it was expensive to purchase and it’s expensive to maintain but it’s a necessity because I live alone in the country and I have no family nor friends who live close by.  A cell phone isn’t an option......</review>

An easy fix on a laptop (fixing a key on the keyboard) turned into returning to a laptop that doesn’t turn on. I am very disappointed with the service at this store. Trust them at your own risk.</review>

Upon picking up my phone, a different price was quoted, after making a 45 dollar deposit,  when I challenged the increased amount, the clerk used my phone to text a discount of 10 dollars,  just need to be aware of final amount.</Text>

<Review>Everything went like they sai it would. They took care of my wife’s phone right away-it just needed a new screw protector- and said my phone would be done in 3 hours. I came back in three hours and it was ready to go! I hope I don’t need phone repair again any time soon, but if I do I’ll be back!< /Review>< rating>

<review>Claudia was able to fix my phone as quickly as she could considering she had quite a few customers come in.  The screen on my iPhone was replaced and during the time i was there waiting, many people came in with different devices (phones, tablets, game consoles). They were all greeted nicely and she gave them straight forward answers without wasting anyone’s time. Definitely would recommend!<//review></record>

OH MY GOD!  Incredibly STUPENDOUS SERVICE!  She did an excellent job of repairing my iPhone!  This was the third time I’ve had it repaired and was much faster than batteries/bulbs was.  Price is similar but price isn’t always the defining element of everything.  I know it sounds silly but I knew she cared about what she was doing.  It’s just a phone but it isn’t just a phone.  Its MY phone and it was expensive to purchase and it’s expensive to maintain but it’s a necessity because I live alone in the country and I have no family nor friends who live close by.  A cell phone isn’t an option......< /Text>

Yesterday my dad and I went to get his 20 years old phone fixed. I was hoping that the gentleman would tell us that there is no hope so my dad would get a new phone, but Joe ( I hope that’s his name ) fixed it and made my dad so happy. He was so fast and very professional. Thank you<//review>

The customer service was good. The manager was very pleasant and seemed competent, but my replacement phone battery is actually worse (much worse). My phone now drops from 20% to 4% in minutes with only one app open. I am going to apple for a new battery.< /review>

<Text>I was having a problem with my phone's battery and found RepairAll in Turlock to be very helpful in replacing the battery. Being very curious about how things work, and having retired from an IT position in April asked if I could watch the transfer. They welcomed me into the back room to watch how it is done. We had a great time and I learned a bit more about my smart phone. I highly recommend RepairAll for your smart phone etc needs. The battery seems to be really good because my phone functions like it did when it was new.<//Text><response>None</response><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x809107420043c025:0x13887bb137d0adec< /gmapID><time>1511926366090<//time>< username>

The young lady there was not welcoming and not resourceful and was suppose call us as soon as it was done, never did!! I had to call the store to see if it was done. I will not visit the these store again and will not recommend it to others.<//review><user_id>110381430632936205787< /user_id><GmapID>0x809107420043c025:0x13887bb137d0adec<//GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate>< Resp>

Found the store very helpful. Screen had cracked completely and it was fixed completely within an hr. Just a bit pricey thats all. Better off investing $150 here one time rather than getting scrued $100 somewhere else just because its cheaper by $50 lol.</text>

I’m the worst at cracking my screen and breaking the inner workings of my iPhone. From a cracked screen to a broken speaker or WiFi antenna they knew exactly what to do and they were able to get it done quickly so I wasnt without a phone for to long.</Review>

Updated comment:
I brought friends to have their phones fixed yesterday, February 19 MLK Holiday, to Claudia.
With a bit of wait as she worked on them after explaining what she will do to fix the phones, we were all convinced that she is a guru expert. We were all in awe.
THANK YOU REPAIRALL CLAUDIA!!

Old comment:
Grieving for my broken phone glass shattered, and losing all my data and VERIZON wasn't any help, I told all my friends what had happened and they were NO help.
Then by accident while my dentist was showing me her expanded office, I saw a  RepairAll poster with a cell phone smashed just like mine .
Met Claudia after being in line with other cell grieving customers.
Then wala!!
Got all my data after Claudia fixed my phone like brand new,  transferred all my data to my new SansungS8+ and she made sure that all my priceless photos over a 1000 thru the years and contacts are auto backed without me doing anything.
I FOUND MY PERSONAL IT MASTER WHO CAN CAN ALSO FRANKENSTEIN A DEAD CELL BACK TO LIFE!!
THANK YOU CLAUDIA!!.. AND REPAIRALL.
Sincerely grateful,
Eddie Gutierrez, San Jose CA
Los Banos CA</text>

Got my daughters screen repaired within 20 minutes but I did think $120 was a bit hgh in price for iPhone 6 plus.  Compared rates and I'd pay 88 in Modesto. 😕< /text>

We are familiar with the "discount" repair stores and kiosk locations using lesser quality parts in order to offer a cheaper price.  We also offer a "lifetime warranty" on parts & labor for all our screens.  Hopefully you\'ll come back again so we can give you a free screen protector for taking the time to give us your feedback about your experience.  Thank you, JH'}< /response><Rate>3< /Rate></record>
