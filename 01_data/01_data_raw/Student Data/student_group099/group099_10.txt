<review>A huge shout out to the everyone at Economy Auto.  Had my car worked on less than 6 months ago at another location and suddenly started having the same exact problems.  Took the car to Economy Auto and they fixed it all for less than half of what I originally paid.
The employees are all very personable.  Makes you feel like you're talking with friends.  They explained everything they checked, gave an honest estimate and did the work quickly.
Finding an honest mechanic with integrity is a challenge these days.  The people at Economy Auto definitely have both so I would highly recommend them to anyone that needs to have their car serviced.
Thanks for getting us back on the road!</review>< Rate>

<text>I bought my car a year ago and I have yet to receive the pink slip. Not to mention within the month of having the car the engine light came on keep calling and trying to get in contact with them no reply. I been pulled over in the car. Cops say the car hasn’t been registered since 2017..... like this is extremely unprofessional and I wouldn’t recommend ANYONE buy a car from them<//text>< time>

< review>
I have been going to Economy Auto Center for probably six years, they were recommended to me from a co-worker! You will never find more honest mechanics then the owner and his employees. Nowadays I wouldn't trust my car to anybody else, it's very hard to find an ethical good mechanic ... and Econo has all of that! As a senior Woman by myself it's very reassuring to know that I will never be taken advantage of or lied to like I have at some dealerships. Their prices are better than reasonable oh, and I would recommend this repair shop to anybody!</review>

<Text>Well where do i start...Took our vehicle in for some work, and 4 days later our differential was bone dry - with absolutely no signs of a leak. After speaking with 3 different tech's all agreed it must have been drained accidentally - interestingly enough the owner of economy auto agreed. However his perspective was that even though they did the work it was not them. In fact he offered an explanation "That maybe an enemy of ours drained it in the street" - "I responded this feels more likely than your oil change guy draining by accident - who was under my car 4 days ago?

To be candid I didn't expected the owner to take responsibility - However being a business owner i was hoping we could find a common ground. Maybe I pay for the new differential and they install etc.

Instead I was stonewalled and left to pay a $3,000 bill by myself because of their incompetence - for those of you that don't know - a differential should last the life of your vehicle never needing a replacement.

Well, sad to see another dishonest man incapable of doing the right thing.

Cheers!< /Text>< pictures>

My daughter saw an Andrea & Leo dress she wanted to wear for prom.I searched the Internet for places to purchase it. I came across Mia Bella the Label’s beautiful website. I notice the price was lower than anywhere I could find and she offered 15% for first time purchase and free shipping!! I called and spoke to Debbie the owner. She was so kind and helpful. Answered all my questions. I placed my order , it quickly shipped and arrived less than a week later from California to Tennessee! The dress is even more beautiful in person and it arrived in a lovely garment bag. My daughter adores the dress and our experience with Mia Bella The Label could not have been any better. We will definitely order from Debbie again! Thanks so much!

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Where do I even start?? Debbie and her team are amazing!! Let me just say not all stores where as nice as this one. Debbies staff was great and Debbie herself was very patient with me. I tried on two dresses over and over again because I couldn’t decide but she was never pushy. Her advice was honest and she also has a good eye for her gowns and what compliments each body type. I felt confident in my purchase and never once was she persistent not even her team. Her seamstress was very kind and very sweet and took direction well she wasn’t rude what so ever as others I’ve encountered for past events. The quality of the dresses are great I’m obsessed with mine I can’t stop smiling at it! I told myself that if I still feel happy and I’m still smiling after each fitting (because sometimes we change our minds), then that is the one! You will not be disappointed when you come here her dresses are beautiful and her staff is great!! Thank you Debbie and team :) !!!</Review>< Pics>

LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I had taken my daughter to a million places before finding Mia Bella. My daughter is very picky and she couldn't find the right dress for her Senior prom.  The owner knew exactly what she wanted and ordered it for us. She was AMAZING!! I wish I would have come here first!   My daughter loves her dress and can't wait for prom!< /Text>

Great experience! So many beautiful dresses. My first time buying a formal dress for prom and it was quick and easy going. Due to COVID and the last minute knowing of prom dates they accommodated to all the people coming in and helped out with dressing rooms ASAP. The employees even gave suggestions to dresses when they were short on staff. Will definitely go back!< /Text>

<text>I am not sure how there could possibly be negative reviews especially about customer service. Debbie was amazing!! She fit me in for an appointment quickly when everyone else was booked yet she never made me feel rushed. The only store I went to where she actually helped me get into the gown .. not just clip it. And her feedback was kind thoughtful and honest. She is not cheesy sales type she is warm and helpful type. I was so scared going here because I’ve been before with friends and their gowns are gorgeous I never thought I could afford it she was so respectful of my budget and made sure I found my dream dress for the price I felt comfortable with. I rarely write reviews but Debbie is fantastic and not just trying to push you into a dress to make a sale. Her dresses are of a quality and style you will not find anywhere else. If you want high end fashion you have to go here!!!! Thank you so much Debbie your service was beyond amazing.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809442a61e089d83:0x563f338174cc7a2b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The owner was very rude. Don’t waste your time!
(She will also reply to low reviews and try to justify her clear attitude and poor customer service problems with false information...in my friends case she already had a fitting room but had questions about the dress because it was stained. Before even listening to the rest of what my friend had to say and what we were told by an employee she was rolling her eyes and raising her voice!) If five different people are reporting the same problem about you Debbie there is clearly something foul on your end... Hope you business gets better soon! XOXO<//Text>

I just want to give Debbie a huge thank you!!! You went above and beyond for me and my bridesmaids. I found a dressed that I loved but wanted a little bit more and Debbie said she could make whatever I wanted happen. She help me creat the dress of my absolute dreams by adding a few little add ons. She also showed me an absolute stunning dress to do a dress change and it was absolutely beautiful/sexy!! All around so many compliments on both dresses! She also took great care of my bridesmaids. My maid of honor lived out of state and had a horrible experience at another boutique online and they wouldn’t do anything about so when I told Debbie she got on the phone and ordered a dress right away for my MOH got it rushed, gave her a discount just cause she had to buy a second dress since the first one didn’t work and it WASNT even Debbies error or her boutique but she felt like it still wasn’t right.  Just goes to show how amazing she is and is willing to go above and beyond for her brides. Mia Bella hands down has the best dresses in town. Thank you again Debbie for everything you did!< /Text>

Wish I can give them a negative start not a one star.

Ps. The owner likes to comment back and write false information when she knew...that just because your under staff doesn’t give right to have an attitude like that!! Furthermore, saying that you asked my price range you didn’t say that at all. Obviously by the looks of your ratings doesn’t look good and I’m not the only one.

I went next door and wow difference between customer service she was able to help me and answer all my questions with a good positive attitude I felt like I was being taking care of, also she was too with another customer that had an appointment and also she was by herself. she was still able to give good customer service. Go to LBD much better store then Mia Bella.<//Text>< Pictures>

As for what occurred today you and your guest walked in and you asked if we rented bridesmaids dresses and I answered politely we do not. I also asked what color were you looking for and you answered periwinkle. I asked was there a price point you were interested in keeping within. And you didn't answer and turned and walked out.   I do hope you are understanding of our business and can look at what occurred with a more positive and not negative view as this is not what was meant for you and your friend."}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>I don’t usually take time to post reviews, but you’ll understand why I posted this. It’s about little in depth but I’ll focus on facts.

1. The bride made an appointment, showed up on time, and then was told she never scheduled anything. She’s very detail oriented and told us about it weeks in advance.

2. Once we walked in, the owner did not welcome us or bother asking if we needed help.

3. The owner followed one of the girls into the restroom. No, not to sanitize after use, but to somehow “check“ something?

4. The owner told one of the bridesmaids, after the bridesmaid had already decided to size up, that she should “lose a few pounds.“ I’m pretty sure our bodies are our business.

5. After a bridesmaid posted a review about her experience, the owner implied that we did not want to spend more than $200 on a dress when in fact we were looking at dresses that were $350+. She stated that they were not in the color we were looking for.

Subjective View:

The owner was very standoffish and condescending. I understand Fresno’s market, but if we couldn’t afford to be in a wedding, we wouldn’t be dress shopping.  She didn’t offer any help and instead kicked us out after about 45 minutes of being there (for no apparent reason). It’s rude of her to imply that we only had a budget of $200 when we, in fact, walked over to Little Black Dress and each purchased dresses OVER $200.

I’m very glad we walked across the street because honestly, Little Black Dress really turned our entire day around. She had the best service we could’ve possibly asked for.

For future brides, this establishment has decent dresses but it’s honestly not worth the stress or hassle of having to deal with an indifferent and incompetent owner. There’s enough on your plate.

To the owner, I hope you learn how to better navigate circumstances when you’re the one unprepared. I also hope that your customer service improves for EVERY person that walks through your doors.</text>< UserId.>

I have never wrote a review before but if I was able to give this store zero stars I would. It obviously took A LOT for me to write this review & I DO NOT RECOMMEND!! During my encounter was with the store owner the whole time and did not have a pleasant experience from the moment walking in. As a bride I was trying to have a wonderful experience helping my bridesmaids find a dress but the owner did not make it enjoyable at all. The moment walking in I advised I had an appointment that was booked weeks in advance and gave a head count of how many bridesmaids that would be attending at that time. To the owners dismay and disorganization she had no record and I had to physically show the confirmation and proceeded to blame one of her employees who booked me. As a store owner the ideal response would be apologetic and try to accommodate for their own errors. Dismissing their own errors we began pulling our own dresses and began trying on dresses in hopes we would get somewhere. As a bridesmaid walkout of the fitting room she was unpleasant with the fit and suggested a size bigger to be more comfortable and the owner had the audacity to suggested to lose a few pounds. For any ladies considering this place the owner only carries sizes for the “ideal” body image of a runway model. The experience that I had with the owner is judgmental, prejudice, and discriminates on her own opinion and views that we were minorities and could not afford any of the dresses at the store. When that was far from the case. As a bride I wanted to keep my bridesmaids at a reasonable price point and the owner failed to ask to try and better assist potential customers. It became an issue to the owner when she found out our price point which should not be an issue at all or a factor into how you treat your customers. I quote word for word from the owner  “The fact that your group didn’t want to purchase dresses above $200 is the real issue.” That goes to show the attitude, disrespect, and demeanor you will get from the owner when you do not fit her standards to who she profiles to be suitable as a certain social class. The issue was not that dresses were to expensive and could not afford to go over. That is far from the case. It continued when the owner told us to hurry up because she had other appointment and dismissing my party and appointment I originally booked. So the real issue here was not us not being able to afford the dresses it was the multiple negative encounters with the owner. We do not want to promote a local business that does not deserve it for treating customers poorly and disrespectful.<//Text>

<Text>DO NOT GO HERE!! This place honestly deserves 0 stars. The owner was super unprofessional in her responses to reviews but I decided to look past the online reviews and visit the store in person. Immediately upon arrival the owner was completely disrespectful and made snarky Unprofessional comments about our sizes. FAT SHAMING, CLASS SHAMING, COLOR SHAMING. There aren’t enough words to explain the shocking disservice we received from here. Luckily we were able to find better quality dresses AND service at the Little Black Dress across the street. And when we did find a better store, she accused us of not being able to afford her dresses. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My future sister-in-law was feeling reluctant to go try on dresses during the current climate in fear it wouldn’t feel as special or memorable (in the way a bride-to-be hopes). However, the sales consultant that helped us at MIA Bella wiped away that trepidation. She was genuinely positive with suggestions and guidance and we didn’t feel rushed. We came to MIA Bella because we’ve heard about the quality and variety of gowns and they exceeded our expectations.</Text>< gmapID>

We had a wonderful experience shopping for a dress for my 12 year old daughter. The dress we bought is for a ball and father/daughter dance. They young girl who helped us was so attentive and sweet. The owner was also kind enough to give us a great discount knowing my daughter fell in love with one of the more expensive dresses. We will definitely be shopping here again for all future formals and proms. Thank you for making my little girl feel like a princess 💞<//review>

<review>I was a customer for 8 years now, but after this experience I’m done. I recently went in with my mom to find a dress, the owner was extremely rude as she always is but as soon as she sees we were actually going to buy a dress her attitude completely changes.... I didn’t find anything for myself, my mom on the other hand did. I told her to wait and see if maybe we can find another. As we were walking out we said thank you and goodnight. She responded with “mhmmm”  and rolled her eyes at us!!! Like I’m sorry I didn’t meet your standards? That is no way to treat any customer.... but we’ll go spend our money somewhere else. And Definitely don’t recommend!!!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< review>
My father put a deposit of $215.74 on my upcoming prom dress. Due to COVID-19 my prom was cancelled which was a big disappointment. I was very upset because events were completely beyond my control. Today, much to our surprise Mia Bella The Label store sales people pointed out that at the bottom of my receipt there was a no return cash policy unless returned within 5 days. We never took possession of the prom dress, and therefore a refund was not an option as COVID-19 started much later. Their policy of return articles was printed on the bottom of our receipt, but we were not formerly presented with that policy upon time of deposit. I highly urged any customers in the future to be aware of this policy and not do business with this store as a result of my loss of money. I was also told that i could take out my money in store credit which is completely irrelevant since my daughter has no prom and no use for the gown or any of their merchandise.<//review>

DO NOT SHOP HERE!!  Like many other young girls, I  went looking for a prom dress , as soon as I walked in I could tell the customer service was terrible. I started to look around and was expecting a worker to approach me but NOTHING! I felt so insulted by being completely ignored that I left and never came back. I suggest you look for dresses at other stores, I got mine online and it was 10x better than anything they had in stores. To me it seemed like they completely discriminate based on appearance.</review>

I had a terrible experience but I caught the owner in her lies before she cost me to much time,  she took my money a never ordered the dresses and I got them both from Bianca's Bridal in Modesto and Jasmine explained how it actually works, my dress was completely sold out and the Owner of Mia Bella said it would ship the next week IT WAS SOLD OUT!!! She is not at all an honest person, my daughter's dress had only 3 left, 0, 2. and  a 14 we had to get the 14 and I'm having my seamstress completely redo the dress to fit her. Don't trust her!!!!! She waisted 4 weeks of my time I called her 4 times and each time she lied, I never ever write bad reviews, this is my second time ever but I really don't want anyone to have to go through any problems with their special occasion Dresses.</text>

I was very worried about coming here due to such terrible reviews on multiple sites. But I have been so pleased with Mia Bella. Monique is seriously the best ever, I love her to pieces. She's been so patient, knows what will look good, listens and truly cares. MAKE SURE YOU SCHEDULE WITH HER! You will not regret it for a second! I have had a total of 3 appointments here (I can't find THE one yet, ugh!). The only negative thing I've had is having to wait 10 minutes for our first appointment, but seriously.. that's so miniscule. And the bride before me was saying YES so she deserved extra time.
Love.
And their dresses are stunning. Couture dresses fit like gloves and make regular wedding dresses look like paper bags. It's bananas</Review>

I said Yes to the Dress!
I walked in without an appointment and two ladies were in the shop, one was the owner the other an associate. They said they would have time to fit me in since there were no appointments that morning! The owner picked out 4 dresses for me and I felt like she did a great job capturing who I am and what would look good in me, along with listening to what I was wanting.
I bought the last dress I tried on then and there she was great with helping me celebrate with those who were with me while I said yes to the dress!
Thank you!<//Review>

< review>
I never take the time to write a review for anything, but today I felt like it was important enough to do so. I was very disappointed with my experience at Mia Bella. While they do have nice dresses, their customer service is lacking. I spent over $3000 on my wedding dress. When I purchases my dress we spoke to the owner about adding lace to the entire bottom of my dress. The owner told me that they would measure and call me to let me know how much I needed to pay. I paid close to $400 in extra lace. Finally, when my dress was in and the lace was added, I found out the lace did not go around the entire bottom of the dress and I had not been informed about this. After they tried to blame me that "I did not order or pay for enough lace" they ordered more. Mind you, after they gave me the run around, and told me "they did not have an answer for me just yet". When I finally got the extra lace I had to pay an extra $100 for the missing lace. Personally, I feel that they should have been the ones to cover the cost to fix the mistake that they made, but oh well what was I to do?

<Time>1501353592601<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>I LOVE Mia Bella. Do not be discouraged by some of the older reviews.

I made an appointment for a specific dress I saw online, and Chelsy had me try on that dress and a few more with the style I had in mind. My wedding was only three weeks away, and the Mia Bella team assured me I could have the perfect dress by then. Chelsy was awesome. She was so helpful, so excited to help, and had amazing style herself, so I knew I was in good hands. I ended up with a different (better) dress than I had originally come in for.

The seamstress, Rose, did a beautiful job. She had a lot to do, as I bought the floor model for a huge discount, yet somehow she always managed to meet our timeline. And the dress looks unaltered! It's incredible what great work Rose did. She is truly an expert. And the alterations were very affordable!

The woman I'm guessing is the owner was a little cold. She didnt welcome us as we entered the shop or ask if we were waiting for an appointment. This was the only negative I can comment.

Overall, I am so happy with Mia Bella, especially Chelsy and Rose, and cannot wait for my wedding Friday. These women have made this special day even more beautiful, and I am so grateful for their help and hard work! Thank you both for making me the beautiful bride I hoped to be!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My daughter paid almost  $350.00 for her maid of honor gown. It took over two months for the order to come in. We went in to try the dress on and it was way too large. She had lost about 12 pounds but for some reason, the gown was huge.  We hesitated to use Mia Bella's seamstress because of negative reviews, but the elderly women sounded like she knew just what to do. She pinned the dress to a nice fit and we left. A week later my daughter went in to pick it up. She tried it on and it wasn't quite right. The waist was VERY tight. The lace on the chest did not lay correctly and the back puckered. The  seamstress insisted that it was fine and that was the best that could be done. This cost $80.00 for the alterations.

My daughter was frantic because the wedding was two days away. We went to our local  seamstress who knew exactly what to do. She WAS able to adjust/tighten the lace in front and correct the ill fit in the back. The dress hit a little higher in the waist so the tightness of the waist was bearable. This cost another $40.00.

In all fairness, the Mia Bella's seamstress did take a size 14 dress to about an 8, and I know that was really challenging, but she should have made a few more adjustments to make it perfect instead of saying that what she did was all that could be done and send her on her way.< /text>

<Review>Okay, so I am normally a patient and understanding person; however, I have reached my limit with this store. Here are the facts:

I had a fabulous day picking out my dress--staff was polite and professional.

I moved away from Fresno (350 miles away from Fresno, actually).

I scheduled a time to try on my dress 10 months later, drove 6 hrs to Fresno on a Saturday, only to be told that my dress had not arrived. There were no calls made to warn me, no attempt at all. I was given 2 bottles of champagne and that was that. Nothing else could be done according to the store.

Upset, I later called back and asked what else could be done. One person (a floor assistant I'm assuming) said it wasn't her fault my dress wasn't there--I thought, "well duh!! That doesn't make me feel any better." Called again and got the manager, who gave me a tiny discount and apologized.

I decided to let my fiancé go back to our home by himself while I would stay a little longer and hopefully be able to get my dress. I had to rent a car to drive back which cost me $91 and more than my store discount.

I was called Tuesday and told the dress was in the store and to head over to try it on. I worked with, Rose, on my alterations and pinning and she told me the alterations were separate from the dress price and then I said I needed to think about it before I confirmed my Thursday pickup time--also the day I would try to travel home. From the front desk, the manager said, "Rose, why are you pinning it?! If she has to think about it, don't start pinning the dress." Her tone was condescending and bold and I responded, "I'll pay for it, thank you," matching her tone.

I'm dishing out $1,500 for a wedding dress and she has the audacity to make a statement, suggesting I cannot afford the alterations? Excuse me?! This is supposed to be a happy time and I have only been annoyed and offended by this store's so-called, "professionals."

The quality of the Allure dresses are wonderful but purchase with caution and with adequate time to accommodate the lack of professionalism. Also, have some champagne and a big glass of patience before interacting with these, "ladies."

Rose and Monique were pleasant, for the record.<//Review><userid>107915384877493512302<//userid>< Name>

First of all hours say open til 6pm. They were closed at 540pm.

Secondly the owner of the store yelled at me at the top of her lungs because we pointed out the fact that the alterations we paid $85 for were incorrect. She said “well your dress was $99 dollars somget over it.”  First of all the dress was $199 and the alterations were $85 bucks. Why pay for something that isn’t right? Then the owner pulls out a needle and thread and says she is just gonna “stitch” it up right there.  We asked her to “PUT THE DRESS DOWN AND STEP AWAY” haha but seriously the owner is a lunatic and I wish I read other reviews because we are not the first customers who have had stories like us.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

There was a certain dress that I've had my eye on for months and they had it there! My consultant was Shelbie and she was awesome!! She pulled dresses similar to the one that I liked and listened to what I didn't like.  We talked about tacos and food in between dresses and it made me feel comfortable. I had another appointment that day at another place and those consultants weren't listening to a word I was saying.  The store closes at 4 on Sundays and we called them at 3:42 to ask if we could go back one more time.  Shelbie was there waiting with the dress all ready to go and I said yes to the dress!! The customer service is awesome, the dresses are gorgeous. I don't know what people have against this place.<//review>

< Review>
worst experience ever. we were looking for a prom dress and expected mia bella to be the place to find it since ive heard such great things. nope. walked in looking for a dress with no guidance from an employee yet another customer went in behind me and was treated so well. the employees stopped what they were doing to help this customer whereas im here struggling to find a dressing room. i ended up asking the employee and was given the nastiest attitude, i was wondering “is it because of my race? are they treated better because they’re white?” i tried on and asked the employee to assist me with the straps and she kept saying “no that’s how it’s supposed to be” continuously but no ! a dress shouldn’t be uncomfortable ! my friend ended up helping me. moral of the story. they discriminate based on appearance.< /Review>

<Review>Had a Great Experience here. I found my wedding dress here. Staff is professional and extremely helpful. Chelsey made me feel like i was a beautiful bride and bery knowledgeable about all the different designers. It's important for me to get great costumer service when im spending a lot of money someplace and from the beginning everything went GREAT. She even popped a bottle of Champagne for me and my friends/ family when i said yes to a dress. Ultimate bride experience. Thank you !< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>2< /rate><text>My good friend had just gotten engaged and we were shopping around for wedding dresses together with her family. Mia Bella Couture (Fresno location) treated my friend terribly and unprofessionally. When picking out dresses to try on, the attendant never took her measurements, only giving her size 0's and size 4's. My friend is very sensitive about her weight, and though she protested that she could not fit in those sizes, the attendant insisted there were ways to still get them on (though did not elaborate and left her alone to figure it out herself). So, convinced that she was supposed to be able to fit into the tiny dresses, she tried and couldn't, and broke down into tears. When she was finally able to pick out a dress she was TOLD was within her budget, the attendant then told her it would cost more than double, because she was too big and needed a bigger size (which is understandable, but then why was she told the low price in the first place?).</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809442a61e089d83:0x563f338174cc7a2b<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I had purchased prom dresses from Mia Bella at their old location several years ago, and after reading reviews of their new location I was extremely hesitant to go in looking for my wedding gown. Went in for my appointment and ended up finding a Madison James dress and was given a military discount. Fast forward, we went in to just look for a MOB dress and were immediately turned off by how many teenagers were in the place swarming for winter formal dresses. After attempting to look around, we started heading for the door in frustration when the owner stopped us and offered to help. She took us under her wing like no other, and we did leave with a MOB dress ordered. Our dresses came in on time, as expected and then on to alterations. The in-house alterations woman was extremely nice and altered both my mom and I's dress for a reasonable price and quickly. All-in-all, our experience was right as it should be, with little to no problems in the 8 month stint between ordering, picking up, and alterations.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

< Review>
I bought an $800 Sherri Hill dress for my fiancee for New Years. It had to be re-tailored twice and it was still a spotty job at best. The dress had torn material at the bottom, the snap came off the top of the zipper and some jewels fell off before she even got to put it on.

When I addressed these issues with the manager, Debbie, her answer was "you can cry all you want, we're not doing anything to fix it" -- After contacting the owner, Derek, he offered to return $45 for the tailoring and backed up their "store policy", basically refusing to do anything reasonable to rectify the poor tailoring and even worse customer service.</Review>

I would love to share my experience with Mia Bella from this past Saturday. Please take the time to read my response. My sister-in-law and her 5 bridesmaids drove all the way from Pismo Beach to Fresno to visit Mia Bella with hopes to find Bridesmaids dresses. We were certainly looking at designers such as Sherri Hill and Mac Duggal (which you know cost approximately $500 a dress). We were definitely planning on purchasing a dress since we did drive so far. This is where the disappointment begins. As soon as we walked in the door, a lady looks over her glasses and says in a snobby voice "Can I help you?". Later to find out, this was the owner, Debbie. How disappointing! We continued looking at dresses and are assigned an employee to help. I believe she was new, but wasn't bad at assisting. Half way through trying on dresses we got kicked out of our 1 dressing room because another customer needed to use it. Disappointing again. We decided to stop looking at dresses at this point. We asked the girl who was helping us if she could write down the style numbers of the dresses we liked. She handed us the dresses, a pen, and said "I am in charge of the dressing rooms now, but here you go." We went to the front to sit down and look through the designers books. While sitting there, the owner Debbie, comes out from the back and loudly/rudely yells at an employee because she was not supposed to be touching the computer. I found this to be very unprofessional since customers could hear and down right rude.< /Review>

<text>READ: TAILORING! I am appalled at their tailoring. I was in a pageant a couple years ago when Mia Bella was still in it's multiple story building, anyway the staff was wonderful. they were all very young pretty girls who dropped what they were doing when i has a question. My problem.. the tailoring.. I bought a gown from Mia Bella for my pageant and needed it to be fitted. It was a six and I needed a two. I also needed to have some kind of bra support inserted being as my chest is just weird. I'm usually a good full C. So, I do have somewhat of a chest and needed support. Well, when I picked up my dress the slit had been STITCHED open. It was no longer a flowing slit. It was stiff and stitched in a way that it would remain open no matter what. Second, the padding. The "support" that was inserted into my dress was a disaster i cannot even begin to describe it. Two FULL C padding cups had been added to the highest bit of my dress. When I actually put my dress on my boos would actually be WITHOUT any support UNDERNEATH the sewn in padding. I didn't ask for a set of boobs in my dress, I asked for support. I asked what they could do about it, and I was leaving for my pageant on Friday and it was Tuesday... They said, "nothing" . I'd have to make an appointment to come back after. My dress was $350... because of he tailoring down on it I am not den able to sell it. I was appalled as I walked down the runway of the stage on my big day and my boobs are freely doing as they please. The dress was too small for me to fit a bra on. In my pictures you will see that the tailoring allowed me to be VERY TOP HEAVY. It looked like I had a 22" waist and DD's from afar.. how embarrassing.. It was my first pageant dress too :/  I am appalled at the service and lack of quality put into these dresses when being tailored. I will return for a dress being as it's one of the best places to purchase a dress, but I will not make much contact with the staff, as well as most definitely have my dresses tailored else where! Be aware! - an upset girlfriend< /text>< pictures>

Terrible customer service. No help what so ever. I went in the store just for bridal accessories and wasn't asked if I needed any help after the first greeting. They left my company and I unattended and was focused one one group of clients while we were waiting for suggestions and to ask questions. Left empty handed.< /Review>

<review>I had heard that once you bought your dress from this place, customer service would be terrible. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they are HORRIBLE people.
I scheduled my fitting for my wedding a month in advance and when I showed up with my bridesmaid and soon to be mother in law, they told me, "we've been trying to reach you...our seamstress is out" although no one left a voicemail or emailed me...they had 4 different points of contact for me!!!! I have called several times asking to speak to the manager and sent numerous emails and no one will get back to me....wow.
They were extremely rude and unprofessional and blamed me for not being in contact! They never offered to reschedule or find another day or time, just "Oh well."
I have three different girlfriends that will be getting married soon and I will make sure they avoid this terrible place that has no idea how to treat their customers.< /review>< pics>

I just picked up my bridal gown today to realize that my veil was missing. The assistant tried to give me the one off the rack and I informed her that it was not the right veil. So she went back again to look and came back with the right one which was all wrinkled. She then tried to shove it in a bag as if it was okay. I as if she could steam it and she said not a problem. I Then thought i should check my dress and of course it was all wrinkled so I asked Debbie the manager if they could steam it again and she said yes. I then told Debbie that I would like to express my concern on how the business was manage. Before I Could express myself, Debbie was YELLING at me telling me that I was "an abusive person"  and that they have bent over backwards for me and that if i wanted something done all i needed to do was ask nicely. She continued to tell me that there was something wrong with me and "good luck with your wedding because if you are like this then you are never going to be happy".  I then reinstated that i just wanted to express my concern i a very calm and quit diemener. She continued to yell at me and not let me speak. She YELLED at me for some time and when i got the turn to speak  i simply expressed that I had concerns about the management of the business. She would never listen to me. Debbie verbally abused  and harassed me. At one point i was afraid that she was going to become violent and physically  hurt me. Allison brought my dress back and tried to mediate the situation. I asked her if she thought it was appropriate the way i was being treated and she said she was sorry but there was nothing else she could do. I then asked Debbie if she thought i was treated the right way and she said " no your right  you should not have been treated this way and i should not have yelled that was not right."
Not once did she apologize. I paid for my alterations and left crying. In the down stairs foyer i called my mother  for help on the situation.  As I stood there crying other customers came down and hugged me and said" that it was not me and that i did nothing wrong and that they had heard stories of this store"
I then asked the security guard for a glass of water and property management. I spoke with sonja who could not do much but confirmed that this was a common problem with Mia Bella. Sonja advised me to go public with my complaint and they way in which i was treated and advised me to go to small claims.
I am simply writing this review because no bride to be should ever be made to feel this and should never walk out of a bridal store with their dress crying.
I also took my complaint to the Del Mar store to find out that the manager there is Debbie's son. Who was of no help and defended his mother and the manner in which i was treated</text>< GmapID>

Let me start off by saying 5 stars is an understatement. I am beyond grateful and blessed from the service that me and my family received. TONY was absolutely amazing! He was so real and welcoming and gave me the best advice. Tony worked with us for HOURS trying his best to get us the best deal possible. Luke came in and worked some kind of voodoo magic and sealed the deal. I don't know how he did it but he made it happen and I am truly blessed with the deal we received. I desperately needed a new car. After 3 years of me trying to get out of my beat up car it finally happened! Tony, Luke, and a few others, stayed 2-3 hours after closing to help accommodate me. I highly recommend any and everyone to go see Tony whenever you are looking to buy a car. You will not be disappointed. I see a lot of reviews saying how others are the best but Tony is #1!< /review>

<Review>Working with David was “easy like Sunday morning.” He was engaged and professional, and most importantly personable. I did not feel at any point like a transaction. While finance worked on the loan documents, David made me feel like he was a caring father figure and walked me through maintenances and warranties. He was genuinely excited about teaching me how to use my new to me vehicle. I would recommend Niello and David to anyone looking to shop for a quality vehicle with a true client experience.< /Review><date>1617988664234< /date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Went in to look at a used vehicle. Made an appointment, showed up early, and was promptly welcomed and greeted. I told them that I wasn't even sure that I wanted to buy a vehicle, as I was perfectly happy with what I was driving (which was 100% true). They applied zero pressure and ran numbers with me without pulling my credit (I showed them my scores on my phone). Once we crunched numbers and determined a deal could be made, the process was quick and painless. From the time of my test drive to the signing of final papers, I was out in just over three hours - and they were very busy that day. Special thanks to Lucas for being attentive, responsive, courteous and professional, and to Pedro for being flexible, reasonable and fair.< /Review>< Pics>

My experience with Brian Wood, sales rep and sales manager Pedro Valverde was a magnificent experience! They both made me feel very comfortable and cared for. Two of the nicest guys you will ever meet. They got me into the car I wanted at the payment I need without pressure. Great dealership. I am more the pleased with the outcome! Thanks Brian and Pedro!!!! I appreciate you both!</Review>

Warning for service here. I have purchased 2 vehicles with Acura Nello, as I was very pleased with the cars and service. However, the service now no longer allows loaner cars for the basic service, even if you made an appointment with one on their webpage. It use to be a great way to test drive the newer cars, but now I realize it is time to move on to a different company that will allow loaner vehicles when my car is tied up all day.< /Text>

Excellent customer service and a good experience. Unfortunately, there was no negotiation. No wiggle room to bring the price down. We only had 28k cash and the MDX was 33k and there was no attempt to even try and bring the price down. Pretty disappointing. Oh well. Ordered one from another dealership and hopefully it will be here next week. Thank you for letting us test drive the 2017 MDX it did help us reach a decision to go with that instead of the Lexus.</Text>

<text>FIVE star - Always Excellent, great fast reliable service.
Niello Acura in Roseville is the easiest and attentive car dealership and maintenance experience I have being come into contact with through the years.  Whenever I would need to order parts, do car maintenance or repair to the simple call or contact with customer service is always easy and ultra-accommodating.  Mike (sales manager) who handled most of my car needs is very courteous, highly professional, attentive and understanding with all customers. He called for my car parts and order for the same day delivery, when my vehicle needed extra work he arranged for my pick up and drop off my car within couple of hours. He was willing to do whatever he could to help me with my needs, priced and provided complete disclosure about charges upfront.
I highly recommend Niello Acura for service needs. Overall the service provided was excellent, even my coworker who was with me was amazed about level of professionalism, customer communication and helpfulness of Acura staff.</text><rating>5< /rating>< Date>

< review>
When trading in your vehicle they will low ball you so BEWARE. As an experienced mechanic I've improved my trade in vehicle. From tires, engine, interior, and exterior. All the money and man hours spent improving the vehicle almost was for nothing. I should of took it as is, as should you. Even when I tried to explain all the improvements I've made to vehicle, I was rushed by the sales manager before I could finish adding value to my trade in. Very unprofessional on his end. I went in knowing which car I wanted. And made sure I looked at every number they gave me. In the end I noticed that they added $900 for Lo-Jack to my first offer and when I went to sign paper work it turns out the car I wanted didnt even have Lo-Jack! So if they can add close to a thousand dollars to the final sale price it makes you wonder what else they add without people knowing. Be diligent and do your homework. It's their job to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. Its your job to make sure you get your moneys worth. At the end of the day I'm happy with the vehicle I've purchased. Also very happy with the warranty this dealership has to offer. Dont let salesman make you feel special cause your not! You're just another paycheck to them. Make sure YOU are happy before you sign anything.<//review>

My wife and I purchased a 2021 Acura RDX at Niello and had a great experience with Iana Esipciuc. We worked with her for a couple weeks prior to the car arriving at the dealership and she was great at keeping us updated on its arrival date. Car buying can be stressful, but Iana made us feel very comfortable and not only did we walk away with the car that we wanted, but the entire experience of working with her was top-notch. We couldn't be happier. Thank you!</text>

Great service and very fast. Good price on oil changes plus you get a free car wash but always be sure to check your invoice to make sure you only pay for what you are there to do. Sometimes they may add routine things that you dont necessarily need. Otherwise great place!< /Review>

Could not have been happier with the deal that Javier Zuniga, an experienced, trustworthy salesman of Niello Acura, was able to work out for my grandfather and I. Even though I was a first time car buyer with a credit score of 0, Mr. Zuniga still was able to lower the monthly payments, and honestly answer whether or not certain options would benefit me more or less. The people of Niello Acura are out to help you find the best deal possible!<//Review>

I can't say enough how awesome my experience was from stepping on the grounds to buy a new car, to getting my car fixed, because I wasn't 100% about something right after I bought it.  My salesman, Chris was so amazing. I had the best test drive with him.  He was so knowledgeable about the car I was looking at and had my needs and wants in mind when helping me.  His communication with me during the whole process was great! Even after I bought the car, he still responded to me and helped me when I needed the help.  The service department (Jeff was who I worked with) was so helpful with questions I had right after I bought my car too. So great. Every person I came in contact with was nice and there to help me. I would send anyone to buy their car here and I would by another car here in a heart beat. Such a great experience!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

My sales person was excellent however when negotiating a fair price the person in charge basically said he could not lower the price of the vehicle I was interested in.

What can we say. This is the 2nd Acura we have bought from Niello Acura and Yana helped us both times.  Both times our experiences exceeded expectations. The entire staff is great to work with and took care of us. Yana took the time to help us learn the new technology and functionality on each of our cars and even remembered us from the time before. We will recommend Niello Acura and especially Yana to any of our friends or family looking to get a new car. The Acuras themselves exceed expectations and are really fun to drive.<//review>

Javier Zuniga was our sales guy, which was the best experience. Not only was he very professional, but he was knowledgeable, kind, polite, courteous & more!! I shopped around for months and I finally found my Acura MDX at an awesome deal!   I live 2 hrs from Niello Acura & Javier and staff went beyond duties to get me approved, even with challenged credit/income.  Staff was also courteous, polite, understanding and overall WONDERFUL!!
I will definitely buy again at Niello Acura in Roseville, CA.

Thank you Niello Acura ☺️</Text>

This is the 2nd vehicle I got from here and I recently  purchased  another vehicle from here a couple weeks ago and I must say they are very professional, knowledgeable,frendly,and a trust worthy dealership I have ever been to.Javiar Z helped me get the vehicle I always wanted,gave me options,and never tried to push me to get the vehicle even with all this craziness going around, on another note my MDX A-Spec was detailed by some serious professionals ,great job fellas in that department smooth and shiny just how I like it!! I will be looking forward to getting another vehicle from them the next go around.I got the pleasure of meeting the General manager too Jimmy P ,really cool person as well,made me feel at home with this dealership👍👍<//Review>

Came in looking for a 2018 or 2019 Acura MDX with a very specific package and color. He went above and beyond to try to find me what I was looking for. I ultimately went for the 2020 MDX. During the process, I came in to look at the car probably 3-4 times. Lance was very patient and wasn't pushy. We also visited Toyota and Lexus and had a much different (negative) experience at both dealerships. Luke was also very easy to deal with. Would highly recommend these two guys!< /text>< time>

So very happy right now with the Niello Co. and the ease of my transaction. Today will mark my tenth vehicle purchase/lease with the Niello Co. and my experience as always has been Amazing!!! The respect and feeling I’m working with family is something you will not find anywhere else. If you’re considering a Acura product give Chris Knutson a call. His wonderful customer service and caring attitude about what you’re looking for sets him apart. I would also like to give a shout out to Brian B in financing who is amazing to work with for the past 12 yrs. Forever a Niello Customer!!"

Seamless process working with Chris Knutson and team. Called him in the AM to negotiate the deal (2019, RDX, ASpec, Black/Black), then drove up from the East Bay.  When I arrived,  the car was cleaned, gassed and a BIG red bow on it. Nice touch! The paperwork was relatively painless and I was done rather quickly. Chris is customer service oriented with an attention to detail. Great experience and worth the trip up here.< /review>

I took my car in for a diagnosis on the power steering. When I picked up the car, I'd only driven a short distance when it overheated. This was the first time, it ever ran hot. I pulled over and opened the hood. A plastic hose which connects the overflow reservoir to the radiator was broken. Someone at Niello was responsible for that damage. Right before we took the car in, we'd put power steering fluid in the car and the hose was fine.</Review>

I had an excellent experience purchasing a used vehicle from Niello Acura. The team here made the sale as painless as possible for me. I never felt like I was being pushed into anything and was given as much time as I needed while making decisions. The team delivered on everything they promised. Lastly, their waiting area and it's amenities are fantastic. I highly recommend this dealership. Thank you again Chris K. for a great car buying experience.<//Review>

<Time>1549752642122</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Just a little more consideration for the predicament I was in would have resulted in another contented customer for this dealership. However, that didn't happen. As a very busy real estate agent, it was hard to get my wife to the sales contract process. I requested a slight delay but also assured the sales people that we would buy a particular used car that very day. The price that was offered was very fair and we hurried to complete the purchase within 4 short hours of receiving the offer. We arrived to be told that someone else was buying the car at that very moment. I can't help thinking this could have been handled better. No, we didn't "jump" immediately at the good offer from the sales manager. My guess is that they made a few more “bucks” with the other buyer. As my son said, “it’s all about the friggin’ numbers.”</Review>< Pics>

The purchasing process was surprisingly pleasant!  The initial contact by internet and telephone was immediate, courteous, and professional.  The scheduled test drive was conducted with the same individual contacted through the internet who was well informed and knew the vehicle I was interested in.  In addition he offered less expensive alternatives.
The settling of a final price was low pressure and relatively easy with what I would say was a friendly atmosphere.< /Text>

< Review>
Love this place. Take my Acura here every couple of months to get the oil changed. Now I know how to change my own oil, but the cost of DIY and just taking it in are basically the same, but they dispose of the oil for me and I get to be lazy! Also the free unlimited Starbucks and donuts and a pretty massive plus! The staff is very friendly from what I've encountered, and most importantly, not pushy at all, which I really appreciate since I'm not rolling in money. I really wish I could post pictures because my neighbor scraped my front bumper on the driver side corner and really did a number on the paint, I thought it had been scraped down to the plastic and I couldn't buff it out! The last time I went in for an oil change the car came back out and the mark was completely gone!! They didn't even say a word! They just did it for me for free! Turns out the mark was paint transferred from the other car and they had to have worked pretty damn hard to get it out. Quite an awesome surprise!

UPDATE:4/06/2016 - Just wanted to give a shout out to Mike Emory in the Service Department! Really awesome customer service!<//Review>

This location of Niello Acura dealership is a place we came back second time around to get our car. We absolutely love the hospitality we get here from everyone! Lance in particular is who we want to thank for helping us find exactly what we wanted (I tend to be a little picky ☺️). But He took time and got our car delivered from another location and we couldn’t be happier. It’s a pleasure to come to Niello Acura dealership in Roseville.</review>

This was my first adventure in buying a luxury car and I couldn't believe how relaxed Roger made me feel from the "get go". He was knowledgeable, polite, patient, resourceful, solution-oriented and personable throughout the who process. Roger made me very comfortable as I laid the groundwork for this important investment. His integrity shines! Roger for President (U.S.)!</Review>

<Review>My family and I contacted Niello Acura to inquire the price for a 2019 ILX (Premium Package). As serious buyers, we were willing to purchase the car for my sister on the same day if a fair deal was presented to us. We were immediately given a competitive quote for the car. Prior to coming to Niello Acura, we spoke to Donte Coleman (Sales and Leasing Consultant) and his manager, Brian via telephone. They were responsive and quick in checking their inventory to ensure that the car (color, model, and package) we wanted was available. My family is out of county and drove far in order to purchase the car because we trusted Niello Acura. Despite purchasing the car around after 8:00pm, which is near closing time, Niello Acura continued to display admirable work ethic, professionalism, and transparency. The atmosphere was welcoming and inviting. We could tell that Niello Acura work collaboratively with one another in order to provide 100% customer satisfaction. My family and I love to support businesses like Niello Acura. Thank you Niello Acura, Donte, Brian (Sales Manager), and Brian (Finance Manager) for a quick and satisfactory transaction. We are very satisfied with the purchase and will recommend Niello Acura to our family and friends.< /Review>< pics>

<review>After spending a few months struggling with Bay Area Acura dealerships, my fiance and were told about Niello Acura, and we were blown away with their excellent service.  They were honest, completely aware of our needs and our wishes and 100% focused on the customer experience.  Our representative, Brian, was by far the most professional salesman I've ever worked with, and has continued to be so helpful even after our purchase last week.  We are so satisfied with our experience and couldn't be happier we chose not to give our business to the slimy dealers in the Bay.< /review>< username>

After visiting nearby locksmiths and being dissatisfied with the price I had to come by Niello. I called the Parts department and the associate Mike was very helpful in quoting me the price (much better than a locksmith) and gave me a time frame of when it could be done. The whole thing took about 12 minutes from the time I parked my car to when I received my receipt for my new keys. I'm afraid I don't remember the name of the gentleman who guided me to the Parts department or my cashier but everyone I met was very kind and helpful. Thank you.< /text>< pictures>

<Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>Derek Fujii<//user_name><Text>Update to my review.  I will move it to five stars because they fixed.
Manager called me and said they would fix the warranty issue without charging me.  I brought it in.  They did write the $125 on the estimate but didn't charge me because it's under warranty and that's what a warranty is for.  I did hold my breath because no way I'm paying.  Anyway, it now works 100% of the time where as before it worked 0% of the time for the last three months so I'm happy.  I do love Acura's.  The cars are amazing.  It's just that when I spend $50k on a car I don't expect to be treated like a Ford customer.  All is good and they went out of their way to make me happy.

Original review:  I'm going to give three stars because some parts of this experience was great and some not so good.  I took my car to get two recall issues taken care of and the idle stop fixed.
Pros: When I dropped the car off the guy that took my car was nice and professional.  The guy at the counter was just ok.  I had to repeat things a few times because he just liked to hear himself talk but he eventually got the information down.  The girl that handled my rental car was very thorough, professional, and nice.  The loaner car was nice and it was free.  Both my recall items were fixed.  When I returned the car the wait was minimal and the guy that helped me was nice.
Cons:  I brought the car in also because my idle stop hasn't worked for a few months.  This should be covered under the three year warranty.  I was told I would have to pay $120 for them to look at it and it would be reimbursed to me later if it was under warranty.  Well I'm old fashioned but I don't think I should be charged for an item under warranty.  It's not the issue of money...in the 15 minutes it took me to write this review, I've made another $120.  They should know if it's under warranty or not.  Also I got a call at 4pm that day saying I should head back to get my car and it SHOULD be finished by 5pm because they close at 5pm.  Well it's a 45 minute drive for me.  I said I thought I get 24 hours after the time you call to return loaner car.  Well he said because they are closed the next day for Easter I have to return it in the next hour or I will be charged.  That is a terrible policy.  Finally he agreed only if I return it first thing on Monday I will not be charged.  No problem that's what I planned on doing anyway.  I didn't even use it Sunday and I returned it Monday morning as promised.  I don't think this should have been an issue because I was perfectly fine with returning Sunday.  It's not my problem if you aren't going to be there.  Then I got a call from Niello a few days later to see how my visit went.  I told the lady my issues with them not fixing the idle stop.  She said ok she would note it in the system.  No offer to fix the problem.  Oh well.< /Text>< Rate>

The folks at Niello Acura were totally professional in every aspect.  The experience of buying a car was low key/low pressure.  We were welcomed  by Chelsea Wareham, a new salesperson, whose energy and enthusiasm were  appreciated by myself and my son.  If she did not have the answer to our questions, she sought out those who did.  Thank you all for making the car buying effort pleasant.</review>

Recently, I had the pleasure to work with some of the friendliest and coolest staff I've ever met at a car dealership. I spoke with Chris briefly over the phone before coming in and when I got there, we got straight to business. No pushy sales tactics or any hassles or games, everyone at Niello gets the job done and they rock! I think I was in and out in 4 hours (I already knew what kind of car I wanted). Big thanks to Chris, Elizabeth and Colby for making my first car buying experience amazing! I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone.< /Text>

Man these guys make the whole process so easy. There are no pressure tactics. They just care about what you are looking for. Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick was such a great person to deal with on this transaction. The fear of dealing with a car salesman is gone. If you’re in the market, head over and see what I’m talking about. 👍🏽<//text>

This place is a RIP. 1000 bucks for a timing belt??? Its a 100 dollar part and can be done in 1 to 2 hours.  I suggest you go other places.

<Text>Readings on multipoint inspection that were different from other shops, consultant did not address issues created by the service, ultimately had to spend extra money elsewhere to correct.

I've held off on writing the review, however after my car was just serviced at another Acura dealer, I felt that Niello Acura provided overall poor and misleading service. One was the brakes, where multipoint inspection indicated that both front and rear brakes were worn and were at  the same thickness (which is strange on its own) - I've had the car checked at a tire shop  pretty much right after and another Acura dealer a whole 10K miles after, where I've received substantially different readings (more mm left... fronts are not even close), from this I have to conclude that in the best case scenario, conditions of my brake pads were misread and would have costed me a good amount of money if I proceeded with the recommended service. Also, after rotation, I've gotten a significant vibration issue, correction wasn't offered, so I ended up addressing the issue at another tire shop for additional money (and of course time).</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Absolute scam artist. When you think of the stereotypical used car salesmen and all the negativity that goes along with it that's Niello Acura to a T! Spoke with a salesman about a truck I was interested in that they have listed for 3500 over what car gurus carfax etc says the truck is worth. I told them what I want to pay and asked if that's possible, the salesman assured me they would "make it work" I have no car as I sold mine a few weeks ago. They offered to pick me up in the truck I was interested in. The truck was fine I drove it back to the dealership and they sat me down and after negotiating moved nowhere close to what I told them I could afford, 3k more! How is that making it work? Making it work for them maybe! I told them I couldn't afford what they have it listed for and now they have me stranded out here 30min away from my home! I now have to pay $30 for an uber.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The truck you were interested in has a brand new lift kit, new off-road tires, wheels and running boards installed. Unfortunately these upgrades are not accounted for with CarGurus and Carfax pricing guides, which accounts for the difference in pricing.  I apologize if this was not clear in our conversations with you.  Our staff did offer to arrange for your transportation home, which was refused.

<Text>We found the car we wanted at Niello Acura in Roseville, 80 miles from home. The drive was TOTALLY worth it!!!! Jeff Monos was absolutely AMAZING to work with!!!! I wanted newer mats and a cargo cover that he needed to order. Once we got home another small issue came up, so I called Jeff. He asked us to come back in order to fix my small problem and install the mats and cargo cover. We dealt with Alex and Chandra from this point. Both of them were just as AMAZING!!!! They needed to keep our car so they gave us a courtesy vehicle at no charge. They took care of EVERYTHING above expectations!!!! We are customers for life!!!</Text>< Pictures>

Niello Acura is one of the best Car Dealerships I have ever dealt with!  I work regularly with their service advisor, Chris Lucero.

Niello Acura in Roseville goes the extra mile to provide excellent customer service. They went out of their way to provide a very fair solution to avoid my having to make a second trip to have a rear strut assembly replaced on my 2014 RDX.

Oh my gosh, where do I even begin. Coming in here today I was looking at the used inventory, I had fallen in love with the 2019 RDX about a month or two ago but did not think it was a possibility. Long story short I am going through a lemon buyback with Cadillac on my 2019 XT4. I came in for a used vehicle because again, didn’t think my favorite would be possible. Ector was great, super patient with all of my questions and encouraged me to talk to someone about a possible lease if it’s something I was comfortable with.I agreed, Ector mentioned to me he was new here and was calling in a senior advisor, Lance. Again, such friendly and professional staff. Lance was honest, knowledgeable and really made me feel comfortable. He too, answered all of my questions and addressed all of my concerns. I was approved and literally wanted to cry from how happy I was. My experience w Cadillac w as terrible to say the least and the experience here has been the complete opposite. I feel grateful, happy, and taken care of. This team rocks :)<//text>

<Review>Usually everyone's really friendly and for the most part that was my experience today with the exception of the woman who too my keys, got the license plate number, mileage and then afterwards gave my paper to the cashier who checked me out.

I purchased my beautiful Acura RDX through the salesman Chris Knutson. I have purchased many new vehicles over the years. In all those years I have never had a more pleasant experience buying a car. It was quick and there wasn't any pressure applied. Even the sales manager was great. They were very honest and my husband and I couldn't have been more pleased. We will definitely be coming back!< /text>

Great Experience. Been looking for a van for over a year and was a joy to get a professional company and people to help. They really worked and took time with me to make sure all of my needs were met.

<username>Austin Brown</username><Review>Michael Vopat did a great job with us today and was very patient with us. The most disappointing part of our visit (and why we didn't walk away with a car) is Ken from the finance department is really rude. 0 customer service skills. Hopefully our next visit we can work with someone else and Mr. Niello realizes Ken doesn't represent his mission statement.

12/09/2016 Update
Mike the GM handled this situation really well (including Jeff). We are going back in tonight to purchase our car. The team here really wants to make sure you walk out happy.</Review><Rating>4</Rating></record>

Excessive Spam about Online Services now available. First couple of emails had broken links about how to unsubscribe (this is basic IT, so how are we to trust your service department), and now that I'm unsubscribed they continue to flood me with spam emails.  This is a sure fire way to alienate your customer base, as most folks already get way too much junk email!!</text>

I recently purchased a Honda Civic from Niello and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.  This was my first car purchase experience ever. Mary Alouf was the sales representative that primarily worked with me, and she was very nice and helpful. She wasn't too pushy, and very responsive to my preferences. She was fairly new to the dealership, and was very honest when she didn’t know the answers to my questions. Whenever necessary, she got more people involved to explain the process, features, warranty options, and administrative hurdles during the negotiations. Being a first-time car buyer, the entire staff was very patient with me and I would recommend Mary Alouf and Niello for any used car purchase in the Sacramento area.< /review>

I recently purchased my Acura from Niello Acura on Madison Avenue. Mary Alouf was the sales representative helping me with my purchase. I had been to many dealerships that week and was pretty stressed out, but my experience with the people at Niello was AMAZING. Everyone there was so helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Mary Alouf and the rest of the Niello team will be, and have been, HIGHLY recommended to everyone I know!</Review>

< Review>
It took a lot longer than planned to write this review, but I felt it necessary.

I had always hated dealing with car dealerships until my experience at Niello Acura. I had been in an accident a week or so prior, and they ended up totaling my vehicle. Went to the Roseville Automall on my way back from the Sierra College Used Car deal. After having a couple of bad experiences at some dealerships there, specifically the sales people, I decided to go see what used cars Niello Acura had. I walked into the showroom and asked where their used cars would be, and was directed towards them. As I was walking out the door, I heard someone say "I'm following behind you in case you have any questions, but won't bug you." I thought "Yeah, right."

Well, that's exactly what Chris Knutson did, he stayed back and let me and a buddy look at the cars they had there. When I found any that I was interested in, he assisted with absolutely no pressure. After taking a test drive, I decided upon what I wanted to purchase, and as politley and respectfully as can be imagined, we started "The Dance."

At no point did I feel that Chris was being anything other then respectful, as he would say "Thank you for the offer, I will take this back to my manager." Long story short, we finally agreed upon the purchase price, and when Chris was done with the sales paperwork, he introduced me to Brian Bladow in Finance who handled the rest. The great service continued there, even to the point of working with me to wait for a check to clear from my insurance company for the totaled vehicle almost a week later. When I brought the check in, I was greeted by Chris saying that he noticed one of my mirrors had a blackening to it, and he had the replacement ready to be installed. I was in and out within 30min or so.

Although I bought a Lexus, and plan to buy another when I'm in the market, the customer service, compassion and care was top notch at this dealership, and I would go back to see what they have when I'm ready.</Review>

We recently purchased an Acura MDX through Niello with the assistance of Sales Consultant Jeremy Drebin. The overall new car buying experience was for the first time, a bit more relaxed. I am not saying that the staff did not ask for the order, but they understand our process and gave us that space. Once a decision had been reached and all features agreed to, the process was like others, in that it takes time to complete the paperwork. Jeremy provided excellent service and support throughout the process and initiated some of the final paperwork steps, which again, seemed painless. We are happy with the vehicle, the follow up service and would highly endorse Jeremy and the Niello Acura staff to anyone considering an Acura.
All the best.</text>

We bought an 2004 Acura TL in Novemeber 2003 which Brian Bladow sold to us.  He did a fabulous job then and through the 8 years we had the car whenever we had questions.  All the customer service there has been fantastic as well so when it came time to pass that car down to our daughter, Acura was the only option we considered.

On Sunday, Denise Velez was the first person to ask us if we needed help. We knew Brian had gone into the Finance Department and wouldn't be able to help us anyway so were happy to have Denise help us. She did a great job as well and we could not have been happier.  She was knowledgeable, friendly, and sincere!< /review>

<Text>Several months ago I bought a 2007 MDX from Niello Acura.  As I drove the car I noticed several issues.  I made a list and brought it to the service department.  I had purchased the extended warranty.  The service consultant, Chris Lucero, took care of everything for me.  My GPS system had gone out, among several other things.  He took care of dealing with the warranty people, got me a loaner car, and called regularly to keep me updated.  He addressed all the issues, took care of everything and did it in a courteous and professional manner.  I am happy I bought my Acura from Niello and was very impressed with Chris in the Service Department.<//Text><name>Kathleen Smith</name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

My family has worked with Chris Knutson for years. He is the reason we are an Acura family. He went above and beyond to help me buy my first car on my own. His test drive routes are informative and thorough. I would highly recommend Chris Knutson to anyone looking for an Acura.< /Text>

<review>My wife and I were looking for an Acura TLX with the tech pkg. Robert Herndon at Niello Acura was not only personable and knowledgeable, he worked tirelessly to find us the perfect vehicle. He kept in constant contact and updated us at every step of the car's progress, from its certification to its final detailing. Often, he seemed more concerned than we were that the car arrive timely and in amazing condition. He approached the car shopping experience in a personal and positive way, assuring he would do everything to make it pleasant and agreeable, which it was. The entire process was easy and stress-free, and we are so happy with our new car! Robert helped us find the perfect car, and he gave us a positive customer service experience. Roseville Niello Acura is the place to shop for an Acura, and Robert is your go-to guy!!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1493406868093, 'text': 'Hi Lisa,\n\nThank you so much for all the kind words and the wonderful review! We are ecstatic to hear that Robert went above and beyond during the entire buying process and that you are in love with your new TLX! Thank you for your business.'}</Resp>< GmapID>

We considered many dealers and finally went with Niello because Brian Powers (the Internet Sales Manager) offered the best price out there and also had the color of our choice (Fathom Blue). The car buying experience was pleasant and far from the nightmarish experiences I've heard of (forcing the extended warranty, add-ons, etc didn't happen) and Brian ensured that the overall experience was smooth and quick. I would highly recommend this dealership for any Acura purchase!</Text><user_id>113865454163668427723< /user_id></record>

<user>102618810432250993720</user><review>Wow! Who knew buying a car meant you could have a friendly, not forceful or arrogant sales person? This was by far one of our best experiences buying a car. Brian Powers was our salesman, and he treated us with respect the entire process. Even when we completely switched gears and changed the car we were buying to a newer yet smaller model. He made sure my children were comfortable, as to make it easy for my husband and me to complete the process.
I would definitely reccomed Neillo Acura and Brian Powers to friends and family!<//review>< rating>

I always come here to have the routine maintenance performed on my RDX. I like how you no longer have to make an appointment to get service done. I'm usually in and out in under one hour and I get complimentary donuts and coffee as well!<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>We haven't bought a new car in 8 years. Technology has changed so much in that amount of time!
I was sold on the RDX by it's ability to make me feel safe at the wheel. Thank you to Chris Knutson for taking the time on the test drive, to really make me understand how great this car is compared to the other competitors. I was sold and did buy my dream car.

However, there are so many commands if you get the "technology package", that you need to have a class! Chris really encouraged me to call him up and set up a time to meet with him and go over all the (buttons). I took him up on it and spent (the first 1 hour) in my new car going over the commands that were the most important to me.

I went home that day knowing that I had made the best decision ever! Chris was very patient and knowledgeble about all of the car's capabilities. I will probably be back to get another tutor session if I have other questions, and I have no problem calling Chris up again. He is very open to instruction, and I feel--he really wants me to know the car! Chris is not just a "salesman", but a "serviceman" as well.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< UserId.>

Just bought new Acura.  Test drove other cars similar to MDX, went back to Niello Acura because we had the BEST test drive experience with Chris Knutson.  Chris really knows the cars he sells.  It is obvious that he cares about his customers and he extremely knowledgeable on Acuras.  We feel lucky we had him as our sales person.< /text>

<name>Joel Marsh<//name><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>The One star is for the service department. I called to make an appointment for an Oil Change and was told that they don't make appointments for "Just an Oil Change" and to come in anytime. So I did, upon arrival I was told that the *Just an Oil change* would take nearly 2 hours because of all the cars in front of me. When deciding thats not the way I wanted to spend my only day off, they then offered me a loaner car while they were working on my car. Ok... No biggie, thats cool I can handle that. I told them that I had a coupon from Acura for an oil change for 53.95 (Or something near that) and that I wanted my tire pressure set to 40 per the tire since they are aftermarket and I didnt want them set to factory spec. The advisor who didnt seem to be paying attention, said they would make a note and call me when its done and to allow 2 hours. So I waited and waited, no call and now its nearing 4 hours that my car has been there for "Just an oil change"  I then decide to pop in and see what the heck is going on, upon my arrival my car hasn't even gone in yet.. I am told that its next up and to allow another hour (Really, nearly 5.5 hours for an oil change) which i tell them I cant wait for as I have plans in 45mns in midtown. The Tech says he will see if he can get approval to let me have the loaner car over night since they hadn't don't the oil change or rotation nor had they washed it which they begrudgingly did. He said I would have to leave my credit card info for them to bill my oil change as they were closed tomorrow.  I reminded him I had the coupon for 53.95 from Acura.. he said they knew. The next day I come to get my car from the sales department (Service was closed) and they basically gave me my keys and walked away. Didnt tell me where my car was... Didnt go over what repairs may need to be done-- nada.. Heres the kicker.. I walk outside to find my car and its not even been washed and cleaned.. The tire pressure NOT set to what I asked for and a estimate for all kinds of items that they suggested.. and the bill... Nearly 90 dollars for my *oil change* and no coupon applied.  So, not only did it take nearly half a day for an oil change, now they over charged me, didnt wash my car, didnt set my tire pressure to what I wanted and now they want to soak me for more repairs?  Heck, had they listened, given me an honest wait time I would have dropped the nearly grand on suggested routine maintenance but now I don't trust them at all so going to check out whichever other Acura dealer is near by.  I am FAITHFUL to the Acura dealership and have had all repairs done by the dealership since owning the car brand new back in 05.  Big Fail on Niello part as I am also checking out the new TLX Aspec as well--- But no way in heck i would get it here.</Review>< gmapID>

My buying experience there was friendly, helpful, and easy, BUT the amazing part is that the service didn't stop there.  Chris Knutson walked me through everything I would need to know to get the maximum enjoyment out of my new car and as I drove away from the dealership I hoped and prayed I would remember everything he showed me. HOWEVER,  It has been over a year now that I have had my car and Chris has continued to contact me on a regular basis to see how I am doing with the car and if I have any concerns, needs, or questions. Recently I had to actually ask for help and Chris was there to help.  The day I contacted him he had me come right in and resolved my problem. He really personifies the definition of customer service.  I feel fortunate to know he is there if I ever need anything. He's not just about the sale...He really cares about the customer!<//Text>< user_name>

<Text>I just bought a second Acura from Chris Knutson at Niello. I was planning on buying a different make but my first experience with Chris when buying an MDX last year built so much trust that I went back. Chris is very knowledgable and will tell you everything about the car - both positive and negative. This time, I bought an RDX. It's a great car and Chris helped me learn everything about the car before I purchased. He's the best I've ever worked with and I would tell any of my friends and family to go to him when they need a car, even if they're like me and had planned on buying something else.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<review>I buy a car brand new from them salesman  Michael  seems like he explaining okay but on some things I guess he didn't want you to know like he saw in the car we purchased low pressure on tires but he skipped that and start showing different how you can navigate 2016 RDX  and I'm not going to come back to purchase car from them because when we talked about they said we don't have this car and need to wait 2 weeks till car car arrived  from the port,  and I told them I  don't have any problems with that,  I tell them no rush,  I can wait,  and they call me next day said your car ready to pickup ,  I know if car came from port they use towing to delivered but not in this case they brought car FROM LOS GATOS, CA   and other things they rush you to sign paper .
Buy overall I like a car , what happens that's what happens I'm not going to come to same person to purchase when I  decide to purchase new car or worse for them I'm never come back to them to purchase just going to find salesman where I can come anytime and will be happy to see him .  This is my second purchase brand new car from the Diller in last 7 years first I buy Toyota rav 4 in the folsom automull .
I mark 2 start because I did expect car from Port but ended they delivered from different Diller and 177 miles already there but same price then 10 miles< /review>< response>

My husband and I recently purchased a 2013 Acura TL through Niello.  We worked with Howard Rainer, and he made our car buying experience stress-free.  He was friendly, informative and never rushed us.  I came into the dealership expecting to purchase a Pre-owned Certified Acura TSX.  Howard exhausted all of his resources, and did his best to find a pre-owned TSX that fit my (many) needs.  He was unable to locate the perfect TSX but suggested I test drive a TL on the lot that met all of my criteria.  We were incredibly impressed with this model, and ended up purchasing the vehicle that Howard suggested.

We love our vehicle, and the service that Niello continues to provide.  We've had great experiences with the Sales, Finance and Service Departments.  If you're looking to purchase an Acura, we highly recommend Howard.</Text>

Rick Niello's dealerships are superb. I just purchased a 2012 Acura RDX from Niello Acura, and I had an A+ experience. Vince Gregory found the perfect car for me. It is a pre-certified used vehicle that looks brand new. Vince ensured that my car was detailed and repaired impeccably--I am thrilled. Chris Knutson delivered my vehicle, and he explained all of the RDX's advanced technology in a clear, concise manner. Thank you, Niello Acura!</Review>

First of all, Acuras are great cars and will last you for years, maybe even decades if you want to that route. Point is, that's how great Acuras are engineered in addition to their great and slick looks. But regarding Niello Acura in particular, the best dealership I have ever dealt with in my life. And it's not a matter of me just going in there, having a good experience, getting the car, and leaving happy because everyone was so nice to me. But in addition to getting the best and unreal deal possible on my brand new TLX, It's a matter of a three month ongoing situation. I won't get into the exact details of the situation, but all I can say is that Niello's salesteam (Howard, great guy), GM Vince Gregory along with the other team members went far and beyond to accommodate my vehicle, and me personally. I can almost guarantee that what I had them do for me is something that maybe happens extremely rarely, if that. Point is, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM or concern you may be having with your vehicle or anything else, IT WILL BE RESOLVED with Niello Acura, even if you come months later. You can feel rest assured and secure that they will NOT take advantage of you, and your interest is their interest. I know this review sounds almost too good to be true and even as a salespitch, but this is the truth of how Niello Acura operates and treats their customers. Again, almost every dealership is nice and "pleasant", but these guys were tested and were proven to be the best in the business during a situation that majority of other dealerships would not respond well to. Go to Niello.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>What a difference a dealership makes!  A few months ago I decided to buy a new Acura as this would be my third one in 20 years.  I thought I wanted an RDX model so I went to my local Acura Dealership, Niello Acura for a test drive.  After test driving several different models, I realized I wanted the MDX.  I searched online for the right car at the right price and ended up buying a certified pre-owned (CPO) MDX from Pleasanton Acura.  Big Mistake!!!  Due to a contract mistake and horrible customer service, I returned the CPO 2012 MDX after about a month and I headed right back to Niello Acura to get the car I really wanted.  Jeremy Drebin was my Sales Consultant and he turned my horrible car buying experience into a great one by selling me the car I really wanted (2013 MDX Advance/Entertainment Package).  Jeremy was very knowledgeable, caring and compassionate and was determined to turn my horrible car buying experience into a great one. Niello’s entire staff was very pleasant, patient, and informative and just down right friendly throughout the entire process.   I could have bought the same car for probably a simliar price at Pleasanton Acura (cause it killed them they lose a sale) but it wouldn’t have been the same car buying experience.  Thank you, Jeremy and NielloAcura.  I am enjoying my new car and I have no buyer’s remorse this time. For those of you that want to avoid the dreaded car buying experience most consumers complain about, I highly recommend you go to Niello Acura and ask for Jeremy Drebin as he will take care of you and make your next car buying experience a pleasurable one.

Special shout out to Mary Alouf who was the original Sales Consultant who took me for my initial test drive.  Mary kept in contact with me all the way up to me buying the CPO 2012 MDX from Pleasanton Acura.  Mary is the reason I kept Niello Acura in mind as she congratulated me on my purchase and answered all my questions up to my purchase at Pleasanton Acura.  That is truly a great Sales Consultant that didn't make me feel bad for going to another dealership after she put in all the work.  Mary, I should have stayed with Niello Acura in the first place.<//review><user_name>Deseri Valdez-Beach</user_name><userid>115455079829875417237< /userid><pics>None< /pics></record>

< review>
I stopped by the Niello Acura dealership yesterday to check out the different Acura models.  Truth be told, I was lucky enough to win the use of an Acura for one year.  I have never owned or driven an Acura before, but had reviewed the webpage before going to the dealership.  At the dealership the receptions greeted me and got a sales consultant for me.  I introduced myself to Chris Knutson and apologized for the fact that he was actually not going to sell me an Acura since I had won the use of won already.  That seemed to not bother him at all and he spent the next hour with me walking me through the different models and options .  Chris was very informative, pleasant and never in a rush, but truly interested in making sure that I had all the information I needed to make the right choice.  From my website review I had decided on the ILX hybrid 2013 model.  Once I got to the dealership the decision became much more difficult.  I looked at the ILX model, the TSX, TL, ZDX (a snappy all while drive car that looked really cool), MDX (big SUV), RDX (smaller SUV).  We first test drove the TSX, it handled great and really reminded me of the performance and handling of a 3 series BMW.  Then we test drove the ILX hybrid.  I had driven a Prius before, but in comparison, the ILX handled a lot more like a normal car then a hybrid.  What amazed me about all of the models was the technology inside.I played around with the voice control system, which, as Chris explained to me, was the Acura preferred method of handling technology in the car.  With a couple of helpful tips from Chris, I was able to program my home address into the Navigation system for directions and that while negotiating taking an exit and merging with other traffic.  The voice control actually controls pretty much all of the different systems in the car like radio and climate control.  I had given up using the voice control system in my current car (a BMW) since it was always more cumbersome then just hitting the corresponding button.Looking at all of the different models made my decision not easier, but a lot harder.  I will have to take another trip to the dealership with the rest of the family and hope that they will weigh in and make the decision easier.< /review>

A cool place to take the family. I would recommend parking up at the Friant/Flemming parking that’s across from Sandals. You can walk down the trail that leads to the Hatchery. You can purchase fish food here or plan ahead and buy pellets before you visit.<//review>

Omg! I can't believe I just learned about this place! My 5 yr son and 1yr and half old niece loved it.. ITS TOTALLY FREE!!! Seeing all the fish and learning how they keep up with fish life cycle.. the dam really messes with the eco system .. so they have this place .. pretty cool!! And soo much fun.. they have a great easy wheelchair access trail its soo beautiful!! Great place to spend an easy 2 hours and they have a picnic area.. so you can easily have a lunch with the kids.. they close at 3< /text>

I've been to a fair number of fish hatcheries in my life. They all seem to have several things in common. Lots of fish, in long pools. And normally plenty of food to feed them. This one exceeds many others in the area that surrounds it. They have a great path and nature area that you can walk on to learn all sorts of information about the area around you. There is also a nice amphitheater type area where I assume they could have classes come and learn some things in an open classroom type setting. Parking is great by the trail head. Though from what I understand the main entrance road is currently under construction.</text>

Get the form from Department of Fish & Game have your doctor read it and fill it out, its an easy form check the box and take it back to the Dept. Of Fish and Game and they will give you your licence.<//review><user_name>Susan Rodriguez<//user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< date>

We got there after closing (hours 7am-3pm), but cool facility. Some information signs, and a really awesome nature trail adjacent (FINS), small, but beautiful. Plan to come back soon.<//text>

We had a great tour of the facility on short notice. It was wonderful to be able to share the work being done along with other issues along the San Joaquin using this venue. All of the growers from Denmark were very impressed! Thank you for accommodating me and helping make their trip that much more special<//review>

When I was little I lived in this town and me and my brother and all my friends would come here almost everyday, and now that im grown I bring my son and he really loves coming to see the fishes. He talks to them and says hi and by as we come and go also nice to learn how the fish are raised from egg to adult right here in the hatchery, then released in the rivers for us to enjoy. If were lucky enough to catch one that is.< /Review>

This is a great place to get your kids and have them learn about the native fish, plants and wildlife and take a leisurely hike. There's plenty to learn and have a great staff to answer any questions.< /Review>

Awesome place, I loved taking my son here today. He is only 2 and he had a blast he loved feeding the trout. Very educational for our Tiny Future fishmen. Parents be adviced some people will have thier pets like dogs Tjey have to be on a leash just a little tip fpr you parents. Trout feed was free to public.<//Text>

Not a very welcoming environment and very hard to find. The prices weren't the best but they weren't the worst. The store was fairly messy and the employees weren't very welcoming. They could improve by tidying up and renovating a bit. Also clear signs that showed the prices would have been nice.</review>

<Review>I love the drinks and the bottles! Update for design rotation. It's still the Christmas cup; but I'm not hating! 😁

They got so many flavors and choices to choose from. Drink is delightful regardless you pick. Also the bottle is worth collecting for its aesthetic appearance!</text>

The packaging is very cute and the place is just creative. The drink cups are reusable and come with a lid for easy take out. I normally grab 2 straws because I like to drink while I am there and when I get home. When you enter it feels like you are in a small cafe. There are 3 tables so, make sure to get there before 10pm if you want to get a seat or you can take out. The desserts are delicious and there is a wide variety of drinks to select from.</text>

Always a friendly staff and quality drinks & boba. They are usually quick, and you can order on Yelp ahead of time too.
The shopping plaza is not the easiest to get in and out of, but it's on the main intersection so the location is convenient to grab and go.< /Text>

The main reason I come is their cool bottle designs (reusable plastic bottles), although it is true it is harder to drink the boba on the go since it's not your typical cup. Prices are slightly high but the drink is huge, so it's not too bad!<//review>

<Review>First time visiting this location. Used to go to the one in Monterey Park and I'm glad they finally opened one closer to me. Drinks were really good and I love how their cups are themed. Inside has some cute corgi designs on the walls too! Will definitely recommend checking it out!< /Review>< Pictures>

Had a wonderful refreshing sweet green tea with mango. It's enough to keep me hooked! I will be going at least 2x a week. Keep up the good work!< /Text>

<Date>1528953987691< /Date><Review>Finally a Tea Brick opened up around here! I was passing by the other day when I saw it had popped up under a soft opening and was waiting for the next opportunity to pay a visit.

If you've been to the original Tea brick, it has almost the same menu (with some noticable additions) and overall business structure.

I got a Nutella Snow Milk and a Durian smoothie. The snowmilk's blended ice could have been finer, but was overall flavorful and packed with pudding and nutella. THE DURIAN SMOOTHIE was B-O-M-B; I've had many durian smoothies that ranged from fresh fruit kinds to the artificial powder versions, and I can honestly say that I have one of the best ones here. If you're into that sort of thing.

Sad thing is that it doesn't have wifi yet, but other than that it's a cool spot to hang out and maybe play card or board games.<//Review>< user>

A small place to get tea/boba. I haven't tried everything on the menu but I will come back. Plus, when you get a cup they give you one with a cute design on it. It's usually different most of the time.</Review>

First time I came here it was amazing, but after that it went down hill. Everytime I order hakiado or milk tea  it tastes different and has a medicine after taste. I dont know if it's the workers or the batch but that's unacceptable.< /review>

If you love to have real tea not the fruity powder kind, you have to come here. My recommendations are green milk tea, rose milk tea and honey oolong tea.</review>

I always order the rose milk tea here coz its my top favorite. But now I tried their TEA BRICK MILK TEA with sea salt cream and bobba. I will say this is my top favorite for now and can really compete against other milk tea around the are for its taste. Getting addicted again at teabrick. Highly recommended and for its price you got a very good quality. Service is quick and nice staff here.<//text>

< review>
Basically, got a new phone, don't use any 3rd party cloud drive.  This business FORCES uses to compromise their "security is in our DNA" mantra to allow the app to load again on a new phone.  EVEN though I spent hrs switching app data via SD card.  BUT 2 top it off, now I have done everything STILL the app won't or can't send sms or calls - EVEN though I know my number registered to the app is FULLY active!  Just goes to show FB only interested in ppl's data & money! Download "Signal" - the more of us who choose alternatives the better it will be!< /review>

The food is always of high qualtity, the service towards the clients  is good. I visit often this restaurant and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend it to all.< /review><GmapID>0x80c224597d202d51:0x1280f9b316c9add5< /GmapID>< Resp>

I get to eat here a lot since I work right next to it. I got to say their customer service is always good and they keep the spot well kept all the time. Rates are affordable and they serve large portions.<//Review>

< review>
Terrible customer service. I ordered online for curbside pickup, the girl that brought out the sandwiches seemed irritated and put out, then they completely screwed up my co-workers sandwich so I called and was told I could come back and they'd remake it. We work graveyard shifts so I asked if I could come by later in the day since we were both exhausted, the girl on the phone was rude about it but said that was up to me. When I went back they literally gave me just the items missing from her sandwich. If I had known they were going to handle it that way, I wouldn't have wasted my time or gas to drive back there for some mayo, mustard and veggies. I've worked Subway before when I was in college, it's not hard to get an order right, especially when it's written down for you, and to miss the sauces especially, NOBODY likes a dry sandwich. Horrible customer service.</review>

<Text>Footlong + smaller hoagie-style sandwiches, salads, chips, cookies, sodas, coffee.  Add more veggies to your diet painlessly by eating here. Customize your sandwich fillings as they make it right in front of you.  Los of popular choices for lunch or dinner. Breakfast is surprisingly good here!  Excellent coffee (Seattle's Best).  It's fast-food that's not fried so it has an implied 'healthier' appeal. Good not great. Try the meatball, tuna, turkey or steak + cheese. All the breakfast choices are good too.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>The maid on duty is the worst I have ever seen, she is extremely rude and her attitude is overly arrogant towards the client. They are working for one of the largest fast food chains. His goal is to be friendly and responsive to customer requests. she sells and she is extremely rude, it seems that she gave or paid for the comfort of the clients, the attention given by this employee is completely unfortunate<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>The employees were good; nice friendly, efficient. All I purchased was a large Diet Coke, though; and I guess I should have known better to get a fountain drink from a Subway in a Shell gas station in Mohave, CA. The soda was nasty, because the management decided to be cheap and use old syrup tubes in their fountain machine. What was supposed to taste like Diets Coke instead tasted like Diet Coke laced with rotten fruit; which means the syrup tubes had previously been used for one of their fruit drinks. So, this place gets one star because at least the service staff were great, at about 5:50pm on Monday, Jan 27th, 2020.<//text>< pictures>

Went to Subway with my son because he had a coupon. We've used this coupon plenty of times at different locations and have always been given the proper cup. Coupon was for a free 20oz drink plus chips with purchase of foot long. The cashier gives my son a small see thru cup and tell me this is the cup we get for free and its 20 oz. Nope it was not. 4 oz may mean nothing to you but it does to me. If your going to advertise something for free with purchase it should be what u advertise not what you want to give.
FYI.. I know it was 16oz because I bought a 20oz drink and poured it into said cup.</text>

Went to the subway off the 14 in Mojave I asked for double meat first to put double meat on then they took the meat off I'm looking like what's going on and the girl kept making a point to say that I ordered double meat to the cashier even the cashier said that's enough that girl has to have an attitude adjustment and better understanding of how to make a sandwich I think I'll pass on that Subway in Mojave at the Shell station from now on<//review>

It's not all that fancy of a place, it's kinda lacking curb appeal. Its decent healthy food prices fair. It could be way better if they actually worked for better appearance inside and out. Parking is a nightmare,  handicapped people stuck walking a distance. A distance of any distance for handicapped is a distance too far. Needs some improvements,  stail smell in the air , not sure if old bread or what. It wasn't all that clean, scraps on cutter boards vs cleaned and tidy. Pretty huge disappointment< /Text>

This is one of the busiest subways I've been to and the staff was making good quality sandwiches and keeping up with the rush like I have never seen before in a subway restaurant before.  And I didn't hear a single employee complaint.  Nothing but smiles and friendly voices.  This is rare anywhere these days.

On top of that they had some toppings I haven't seen anywhere else like cilantro.

Great food!  Great service!  A++++.<//review>

<Text>Normally service and food is good. However some of the night crew are more concerned with closing than giving good service. You walk in and there is trash which they are trying to get together.  There is one female who has been  less friendly to me several times. Why I do not know.  I also perceive that the same person has issues with the way  I want my order.  I have never had this experience at a Subway in many different states. It is a great disappointment and I am considering NOT GOING BACK.< /Text>< date>

Service is awful , used to be good 3/4 months ago but it’s gotten worse since then , food isn’t always good , sandwiches come out messy , workers seem like they don’t know why they’re doing , wouldn’t recommend this subway to anyone anymore.<//review>

What do you wanna hear? It's a F-ing Subway in the middle of the Mojave! The woman working was the friendliest person I've ever dealt with at a Subway. Sub tasted like every other sub I've ever had from Subway, and thats a good thing.</Text>

Prices, are just SO CHEAP, you can´t go elsewhere and get the same amount of food you can get here. It is a max of $12 and you can get a ginormous  plate and a large drink for yourself.  It is clean & neat and the service is amazingly good< /review>

Love this place. Been coming for +20yrs for nachos!! Thr only thing I did not like today, a paying customer was asked to wait outside for his order. He was a homeless. None the less he did pay!!! And it's not like it was full!!! And they do have waiting area!! Other than that...food is great!!<//review>

I order  carnitas  plate. Which had  bean rice  salad with aquacado sauce .. carità was cold  had to go tell the ladie in the front  beans taste like they were  from another day just terrible  food seems to be microwave  plate was hotter than the food. Beans are dry as duck
#not called food
Husband got   steak picado  was horrible     didn't even look like if it was well prepared the meat was just  cut in pieces  and just lazy sauce on top ..
My son got  2 tacos de cabeza  which is his favorite meat ,   he just took 2 bites and he said he didn't like it ..

<Review>I tried ordering online for a delivery since the website and the App specifies there is delivery available however the app was not able to recognize my address so i called the store directly. The co- manager priscilla was not able to help me either since she said she couldn’t do anything and the website said there was no delivery however there is posts saying DELIVERY AVAILABLE!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡 What if I HAD COVID and i wanted that delivered?? She still aaking if i wanted to order for pick up!!!! This is so stupid, just take out those signs on ur website saying there is delivery available but yet when u put in ur address to order it tells you no delivery avaible!!<//Review>< pics>

I absolutely love how you can order online and pick up 15 minutes later. Also wait in no line! Just walk up to the warmer and enter your code it opens and you walk out. Simple! You don't even have to talk to a human lol I should do the commercial for them Hahahaha.<//Review>

Love the thin crust pizza...Ordering on line easy & always correct.... I'm not giving 5 stars because they 4got to cut pizza twice.. But that's only 2 out of 20 or so times.. When I informed manager Stephanie the 2nd time it happened..She was so nice & offered my next 2 pizzas free.. Great customer service...<//review>

you don't go to this chain for tasty pizza, you go here for cheap, fast, and OK pizza, slightly better than frozen.  I usually get cheese pizza from Little Ceasars and it's an OK pizza for a reasonable price.</text>

<userid>108309317600750902675</userid><review>So I stopped by this little Ceasars to get a cheese pizza after my dental appointment. When I walked in it took someone 10 minutes to come up and ask me what I wanted, and when the girl did come up she was extremely rude and unprofessional. I said I woukd like a cheese pizza please. You could tell that she was already flusterd and overwhelmed. After I paid for my pizza she said you just stand outside and wait till I call you in a very rude way. I thought to myself how can she call me if she never asked my name?...I have not ever had a problem at this location and I inderstand that the people are young that work here but that doesnt mean you can be professional or cuteous to the customers.</review>< resp>

Called in early ordered cheese pizza.
Said its gonna be ready in 15.
Went there after 15.
Now they are putting in the oven.
They have no cheese in the shelf.
What was the point of calling in
If I have to wait 15 minutes
After getting there.
Came for my nephew and nieces.
On July 4th
What a disappointing experience.</Text>

There was nobody initially up front to assist me, but after a minute someone came up to assist me. Food was hot and made to order (did online order), and tasted good as well.

I payed for an Extra Most Bestest and it supposed to have extra cheese extra sauce and extra pepperoni and it had very little cheese and they burned the pizza and didn't even slice the pizza completely i had to slice it myself. This Little Caesars Pizza place is terrible i won't be going to that location anymore.<//text>

Worst service. Not the first time it has happened. Just because its on the way home... What happened to "hot-n-ready" 30min wait for regular pepperoni,  on top of that hearing everyone's online orders not being ready when they say, adding additional 20-25min wait..

<Text>Little Caesars is by far the best value for pizza. It's definitely worth spending an extra dollar to get the extra most bestest Pizza. Just be careful when you're loading on the toppings as that's where their money is made. If you're very simple and like pepperoni then definitely choose Little Caesars.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Short waits for affordable pizza. Great many are ready to go and personally love the deep deep dish, though really wanting to try the stuffed crust. Polite and nice staff at this location too. Only downside is the 711 next door doesn't sell beer.<//Text>< time>

Now that they re model the inside of the place it look a really nice, but the associates in the back can't tell they have customers waiting to place order they are to busy chit chatting. I wanted 10 mins just to place an order when there was nobody else there. The associates could do a better job greeting and acknowledging the customers.< /Text>

Can't keep track of orders worth a crap. Paid for a deep dish, waited the ten to fifteen minutes, then tried to hand me a regular pizza. When I said it was a deep dish, then proceeded to charge me another $4. So ended up paying these idiots $12 dollars for for one deep dish. There are a bunch of these joints not far from this one, do yourself a favor and go to another one. This one is run by absolute, bottom of the barrel, idiots.< /Text>

Next, couldn't figure out what oven roasted meant. Getting impatient, she goes talk to the manager-apparently now they "don't do wings." Ok, this is getting ridiculous. I came for pizza and wings. Freaking A it ain't rocket science. Thankfully the manager figured out how to make the wings. Only now "It's going to take 20 minutes." Kidding me?!< /text>< date>

Never stepping foot at this Little Caesars Pizza EVER again. Every time I go in and order they take more than 30 minutes for my order. In the most recent experience, they gave out the pizzas for free and their money back to two guys who were in front of me and did not acknowledge my order until I had to go and tell them. At this point, it had been an hour when I approached them and asked for my order. I got my money back, but I did not get any of my pizza's. When I asked why I did not get my pizza's with the money back the manager's answer was "Ohh its because they are assistant managers and do not know what they are doing." That really infuriated me because they wasted my time and felt like I got treated unfairly. If the the assistant managers do not know what they are doing then please TRAIN THEM. REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!<//Text>

<response>None</response><review>The only reason I gave them one star is to write this review. The cashier don't wash their hands they took my money and whent right to handle my pizza. The cashier gave me attitude when I confronted her about it. She said if I didn't like the way they worked and handle my food, then I shouldn't go to that location because thats how every little ceasars do it . I called corporate and reported my experience to them and gave them the store number.. I also called the health department and they handle my issue right away they called me withing 3 days explaining that they had gone to check my complain... So be careful  Hope this helps to anyone that is planing on going here!!!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1532197585323< /Time><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I was told 10 minutes  after watching two people in front of me get there orders wrong, i checked mine when they brought them out. It to was wrong. I had already been there 30 minutes. There solution was to charge me another dollar and wait 10 more min. Or 30 in reality. Never going back.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Had to wait 30 minutes for my pizza it was the 5 dollar pizza they should have a surplas. Many people left because they didn't want to wait for 20 minutes or longer. Think I will order ahead of time next time I go there.< /Review>

<Review>When we enter, look like they were going out of business 🤷🏾‍♀️ My husband & I found some nice cups for his up coming 50th BD. They were priced @$3.99 they scanned @$9.99 & the cashier checked, saw it was under the $3.99 & still said she couldn't sell the cups @that price🤔  We normally would ask for a Manager but I didn't hv the energy! This was our 7th store & it was only 12 noon🙄< /Review><date>1614339801339< /date>< response>

I order ballons for pick up. I walked in and I was waiting in the pick up area to pick up my ballons. Come to find out that was not the line for picking up ballons. But they didn't not have any signs saying ballon pick up. Also they don't have any signs on the floor saying 6 feet apart!. Only in the ballon area. But even that people where not respecting the 6 feet distance. And plus their was a customer that came in without a mask. And the employees never said anything to that customer.< /review>

Terrible service again by the same lady the few times I’ve seen her she has an attitude problem and very unprofessional. The line was all over the place and the lady in charge of the balloons told me “that’s not where the line starts, that’s why I’m fixing the line” that the starting line was shown on a balloon. Customers will obviously be searching for a starting line sign not a balloon !!! Same woman also told another family if they were in line to “ scoot over for her”.</Text>

Wont come here again until someone makes sure their staff get some customer service classes. I went today to buy graduation stuff for my daughter.  And I got the most rude cashier. It got me upset because she had the nerve to tell me I cant return anything back because its final purchase on graduation products. It wasn't in a low voice. I didnt hear any of the other cashiers tell any other customers the same thing to any of them that was truly very embarrassing. I didnt go and spend $1 or $2 dollars everytime I go I love to spend more than $100 because I always find everything I need here. I know we are all going to things especially with this quarantine but theres no need to act like this.< /text>

The staff is extremely rude and yells at there customers when they are doing nothing wrong and they seem like they hate their life and projecting the hatred on to others and I am never coming back here again also they are very unprofessional and cuss at customers. They deserve negative stars in all honesty.<//text>

Need to open more register. The line is moving too slow with so many employees walking around. I ordered a balloon set and I forgot to get a weight. So as Gustavo was blowing up the balloon I asked if I get purchase one without getting back in the long line with only one cashier open. He said no even tho he had a drawer open. Please remember customer service is the most important for returning customers. Cathy was great tho!</review>

I really like this location because the employees are friendly and it's close to my house. We needed one near south central. But it was a bit empty. Not sure if we went there in a season take down or they simply didn't have merch.<//Review>

The people that work there are so rude and I'm assuming that they might not have enough space in the back for storage because when I went there was a mess of boxes in the back everywhere. I wanted Minnie mouse invitations and they didn't have any! I'm assuming they were in a box not put on the shelf. And they are REALLY slow.< /Text>

Don’t go here. I picked up my online order and part of the costume was missing but didn’t realize until I got home. What a mess! The employees need some real retail training and the store is so sloppy. Go to the party city near Atwater. At least the floors there aren’t sticky.< /review>

I had a costume emergency right before a play performance,  and the girls here took their time and looked through all the inventory in the back...and found exactly what I needed!! I had already been at another Party City store, and didn't get helped the same. They saved my fundraiser performance of the play!! THANK YOU Carla and Angie!!</Text>
