<text>My wife and I have been going to Van Ness Dental for over 25 years and they are always very friendly and accommodating.  They have worked hard to keep their dental equipment updated and always keep things very clean for both their dental equipment and the facility - and that was even before the pandemic.   We would recommend Van Ness Dental to anyone who needs a well established dental practice with great staff and dentists.<//text>< pictures>

Awesome Experience Dr. Ja has been my dentist since I was about 8 years old almost 30 years and I have yet to get a cavity! I decided to bring my 4 kids because of his ability to clean well and in a timely manner.  All of my kids are cavity free as well and will remain that way! My mom use to get her teeth cleaned here before I came here. Support staff has changed over the years but always an awesome team willing to help you no matter what!</Text>

My deep cleaning when much more comfortable and smoother then any of my other dentists before. My nice docto took her time to pause and ask if I am okay multiple times during the procedure. Soft touch. Friendly services. Straight to the point diagnosis & pricing for which surfaces will be cover by insurance or not. Plus quick efficiency appointment scheduling win me over.  Bright and clean office setting also help you relax.

The only drawback is :
Now I have no excuses to skip my future dental checkup and cleaning anymore.</Review>

We create a treatment plan together, they do the work at my pace, and work with my special needs. Work I've had done has held up very well.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I've been going here for about 8 years and I can't speak highly enough of Dr. Nip and his team. They've really stayed current with updating technology, techniques and even keeping the offices nice. I like going to the dentist as much as the next person, but they do make the experience better. Helps that they recognize me and my family and just have my history/records all in one place.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>Even though I now live an hour north of SF, I still recommend Van Ness Dental. Dr Christian Nip has been my dentist since 2001; his care and expertise is thorough, friendly, and the staff are awesome! They are the reason my teeth are in such great shape, and when I've needed more complex work, I knew I could trust them to do it with care and confidence. And though they are located on busy Van Ness Ave, in almost 20 years I've never had an issue with finding parking. They are the best!</text><Time>1519506085966<//Time><userid>118230395899635748375</userid></record></dataset><record>

I've been going for over 15 years to this dentist and have always been impressed by their no-nonsense approach, efficiency and friendly staff.  I've heard of other dentists that pamper you with mood music, cushy chairs, massages, etc.  I'm not there for a relationship.  I'm hoping to get in and out as quickly and painlessly as possible and I've been very happy with the work they've done which is primarily prophylaxis but also have had a number of other more complicated procedures which I was very happy with.< /Text>

I've been a patient of Dr. Ray Lee's for years now and can give him - and Van Ness Dental Group - the highest recommendation.  He is a great doctor who is very responsive and really pays attention to your care.  He explains everything thoroughly and shows you on x-rays exactly what the issue is - very upfront about whether it's ok to wait on something or if it needs to be taken care of immediately.  I've got a mouthful of past issues so have been to many dentists; he is the best.< /text>

< Review>
I highly recommend Dr. Christian Nip.  He's been my dentist for over 15 years.  He did such an amazing job of matching replacements for three of my front teeth that I am routinely complimented on what nice teeth I have.  He is also a very kind and considerate person, which was particular apparent when he cared for my husband, who had Parkinson's Disease and dementia in later years.</Review>

<review>I had a throbbing tooth ache and called Monday at 9 AM to see if I could schedule an appointment since I normally see Dr. Charles Nip on Fridays but was hoping I could be seen that day and the receptionist came back in 5 minutes to tell me I had an appointment at 11 AM.  I was truly surprise and extremely grateful Dr. Christiaan Nip made time to see me and determined I needed a root canal and it was scheduled on 8/1.  I was grateful and impressed!  Great service!!

<review>I think this clinic might be partnered with Liberty Dental where Liberty Dental sends patients in, then this clinic tells patients that they need this expensive deep cleaning that will make the total cost of the dental bill much higher. I switched my dental plan from Liberty dental to another dental plan, then went to another dentist who disagreed on the deep cleaning decision. The dentist at Van Ness Dental Group also spent very little time with me before she let her representative informed me this decision.< /review>< user_name>

The place is clean, the staff is friendly and professional.   My appointments are very punctual and did not have to wait.  I liked the fact it was the dentist who cleaned my teeth not dental assistant like other dental offices.  I will definitely go back there and refer friends in this dental office!< /Text>

Fillings failed, charged over the top even with the best insurance. Do not go here, they rip you off. Dr. nip suggested different types of fillings from the insurance only to charge you an extra $200. Literally the worst practice I've ever been to. Don't let the nice small talk and smiles fool you. Can't believe a filling after 6 months has already failed. I had better fillings from the Philippines for $20 then these people.<//Text>

This dentistry should be avoided like the plague.  They are a grifting scheme...nothing more.  After the receptionist informed me they weren't able to check my insurance (at all, I guess), they made me wait 60 days to schedule an appointment.  At that time, they informed me that I needed to come into the office for an examination so the "doctor could learn my mouth".  I asked if that would include my cleaning (the purpose of the visit) and they informed me that IT WOULD NOT, and that I'd need to reschedule a cleaning within another 30-60 days (which they couldn't book for me prior to my "exam"). Clearly this is a scheme to run up billings against my insurance package, and not an attempt at honest service or work.

I've lived in 7 cities across 5 states and on three continents.  I've never experienced this issue.  By comparison, I just called another dentistry in the FiDi (FiDi Dentistry) and they have me scheduled in a month for a cleaning, insurance verified.

I guess the folks at Van Ness dental group care more about their policy than they do their patients.  Shameful lack of service.  Stay away (if you could ever get included in the first place).

P.S.  Giving them 1 star because I can't give zero.</Text>

Referring others to your office has been easy to do.  Hopefully if and when they are looking for a new dental office, they will research your web site.  My friends are pretty thorough in reviewing services before buying.  My diligent research pointed to your office for both expertise and location.< /review>

<Text>I've been seen by Dr. Lee and his hygenists for over 5 years now.  He's quick but gentle, articulate, and explains things well.  My teeth are the zero-cavity type -- not much of a challenge for him, so I can't speak to how procedures other than cleanings and x-rays would go, but I can definitely recommend him and his office.</Text><rate>5< /rate><userid>111238306036726949462< /userid><username>John Ciccarelli<//username></record>

Stay away, literally! Very over-priced. $550 for the simplest cavity. This means that even with the best insurance, you will still have to pay a deductible of atleast $175. Pre-charges $50 for appointments (never works on the first 'check-up' visit, obviously for the $50 to be charged. Genius huh?!). Worked on two of my teeth 20 days ago. Here I am today going back to him tomorrow morning because both fillings failed, off course, accompanied by excruciating pain.<//Text>

<Date>1538865272734</Date><Text>This is the devil in disguise. I say that because you wouldn't typically see any red flags at first glance. However, the situation got so severe, we will be filing an official complaint with our insurance company. If you don't want to read all of this, just skip to #4 in Cons list.

Disclaimer: most of the positive reviews for this place are made by people with no Yelp history or profile picture. Looks like paid reviews for me.

Pros:
1. The place is clean and looks nice.
2. The equipment is new and up-to-date.
3. The dental assistant is nice.

Cons (from least problematic to downright atrocious):
1. They almost never pick up the phone. You have to make several attempts to make an appointment, and even more so to get test results or information. Oh, BTW, they don't call you with your x-ray results. You have to call THEM. What kind of dentist even does this?
2. The receptionist is not friendly. She looks annoyed every time you approach her with a question, and gives you very reluctant responses.
3. The time you scheduled your appointment for doesn't matter; expect to wait. During my last cleaning app, I had to wait for over an hour to be seen. Watching the doctor chat it up with the receptionist definitely didn't make things any better. When I was finally seen by Dr. Tsang, she didn't even apologize for making me wait or acknowledge my time in any way. She then spent LESS than 10 minutes cleaning my teeth. I have permanent retainers, and the cleaning should never be this fast. My plaque came back a few days later.
4. The treatment they offer is VERY bad. Dr. Tsang actually messed up my husband's cavity fillings. She didn't bond them to the to tooth and the cavity ended up popping out. All the cavities had holes in them, and my husband kept getting food stuck in them, which is very dangerous. The deep cleaning we paid $400 for was half-done and there were still a lot of things stuck underneath the gum. We have to re-do EVERYTHING. In addition, the process is EXTREMELY painful. Dr. Tsang is very cold and clearly doesn't care about making the process less painful in any way. My husband had to suffer all that pain for NOTHING.
5. They have absolutely NO MORALS. They don't just try to up-sell you on treatments you don't need or on more expensive treatments. They actually LIE to you and say your insurance DOESN'T cover the treatment you're seeking. Example #1: they told my husband they don't offer the cavity fillings that our insurance covers, and told him it would cost him $300 per cavity. My husband then called our insurance, and what do you know? OF COURSE they have the cavity fillings our insurance covers. We had to battle them for an hour before he could get the treatment he needed. Example #2: when I inquired about removing my permanent retainers, they said it would cost $400 to remove, and another $600 for the mouth guard (which, BTW, isn't even an official retainer) to wear at night. I looked it up; a mouth guard doesn't cost more than $100 on Amazon. They will try to pull a fast one on you at every turn, any time you need anything done. They are simply banking on the fact that you will trust them (since they are DOCTORS) and pay blindly. Absolute disgrace. I don't even want to think about all the people who fell for this trap.

Bottom line: I never write reviews unless I feel like I should really warn people about a shady business. This is most certainly one of them. Don't waste your precious time, money, nerves and teeth on this terrible place.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>I think that this is maybe 11th? 12th? 13th? year seeing Dr. Lee. He's only there two days a week now (Monday & Tuesday). Luckily I can adjust my schedule. Dentists freak me out. I've had some bad (even horrifying) experiences. But not in the past 13 (14?) years.</review><gmapID>0x808580e9d9ecf703:0x5af7c9ce38fb5dfd</gmapID>< response>

Update:
My issue has been fully resolved. Fortunately the appropriate staff reached out to me and was able to help. Thank you!

Absolutely terrible experience. Ordered online, drove 20 min., then am told they’re out of the bread I requested, so no sandwich had been made. Did they bother calling to see if I wanted something different? No. That takes effort and when I asked them to make the sandwich with different bread, I was given the worst attitude. The girl clearly didn’t want to be bothered. I kept waiting as they continued to make other sandwiches, not mine, and finally asked for a refund, which I then was told they couldn’t do. Don’t partner with postmates if you can’t provide the proper service by doing so.<//review>

Great shop. Order here often.  But, 3/4/21
I ordered a Giant Chx Kahuna. Even went double meat for the extra$4. Got home and it’s steak not chicken! Tried to call and you just closed! Luckily, i’m not allergic to steak so I made it work but, not the same. Seems like a pretty simple order #55 chicken.< /text>

Mediocre is the adjective that comes to mind.  The food is good, but the portions are small and the presentation is lacking.  Parking is tricky, too.  There is free parking in the apartment structure behind the restaurant with validation/receipt.  Beware one way streets. Their iced black tea is very tasty.<//text>

Usually a big fan of jersey mikes but tonight not so much.  The gentleman behind the counter wasn't listening, clearly didn't want to be there and huffed and puffed when I told him how I like it.  Had to repeat myself numerous times and still one of the sandwiches was wrong.  One the bright side the food tasted good.<//Review>

Put Subway sandwiches aside. Jersey Mike will take care of you. Better service, better taste, better and fresher ingredients! Their promise to outshine the competition stands solid 100%. I also like Togo’s but their customer service can’t compare. Choose Mike, and have a number 13 done Mike’s way, you will be sharing the word soon too! Quality supreme excellence!</Text>

<Text>They make really good sandwiches here. The meats are sliced fresh to order and so is the cheese.

If you get a chance ask for it Mikes way which is basically vinegar salt and pepper added to your sandwich.

Staff are friendly and very helpful.< /Text>< time>

Jersey Mike's has always tasted great. Me and the family used to eat there often while ago. Then we stopped because like subway they hardly put any meat in it. But this one up at Ortega Highway was a big portion and The Taste was great</Text>

< Review>
I had only ever had Jersey Mike's once prior, at a different location, and was blown away by the food. But this time, I drove through horrible weather for sandwiches for my wife and I, but left thoroughly disappointed.  I ordered two #10s (tuna), asked if one could be made into a tuna melt, and one cold. The melt was made and then set aside while I waited for the other sandwich to be made as other customers' sandwiches were made. After 15 mins I went back to the cashier to ask about the second sandwich (by now the melt was stone cold) and he had no idea where it was. I immediately asked for a refund for the unmade sandwich and left. Not to sound like a judgy dinosaur but I swear the employees were stoned, red-eyed and giggly; that may have contributed to my terrible experience.

Taco Bell next door? Hard pass. Looking for a better taste? El Faro. Grab a large Jamaica or a delicious Horchata with your dependable quesadillas. Feeling adventurous with the new trends? Go there on the weekend only for some birria tacos that are possibly their most delicious items. Feeling like a philly cheese steak that's improved or a memory of a state fair cheese steak sandwich? Grab the steak and cheese torta and don't look back!

From nachos to dinner plates and even a shrimp burrito, you can't go too wrong here. I'm not necessarily a fan of the steamed tortilla but they're happy to grill upon request. Nor am I'm usually thrilled about their guac because it's a little thin for my taste. But I GUARANTEE once you taste their salsa you'll be hooked. You'll never look back next door for any fire or diablo sauce. Come grab an extra salsa that's laced with a hint of habanero and thank me later.

Enjoy a meal made with consistency and don't be afraid to say hi inside.<//Text>

Delicious, no frills family-owned Mexican restaurant that hits the spot. Absolutely loved the burrito and you can't beat a mid-day michelada.  A great little lunch spot!< /Text>

I used to love El Faro! It was my go to breakfast spot. They always had the best salsa and ingredients. That is until this last month. This last month has been a real hassle with all the pandemic related issues. (understandably) I have tried calling at least 30 different times and out of those times only been picked up 2 times. To make things worse I wasn't allowed to order two hours after they had opened because they said that they were not ready to take orders. When I was finally able to order after trying to order for 2 hours the only day that they decided to take my order, they took forever to make my food and I was the only customer there! It also made me feel really sad because it was not even close to how good it used to be. I say this with a heavy heavy heart but I don't think I will be returning anymore. Two years of going there every day and its such a shame that now they don't seem to care about the quality of their food or the service they provide to their customers.

I have loved the baby breakfast burrito for years. Egg, ham, bacon, chorizo, refried beans and cheese are all delicious but it's the yummy gravy that puts it over the top. I would love the recipe so I could make it at home now. Wrapped in foil, the burrito stays hot while I walked to work. Perfect breakfast! I miss it.<//text>

Service
The ladies in the kitchen are like family and they put that love into the food and service. Really nice ladies.

The cashier wasn't very friendly but he gets the job done.

Food
The breakfast burritos are good. The portion size is just right and remember to ask for a little extra house salsa. Yum.

The lunch food is standard trattoria fare. It's a little salty but never leaves you hungry.

Location
The location is safe and easy to get to from Bart, bus and car.</text>

This is one of the best 'classic' taquerias downtown. The prices are great, the food is very generously portioned and exactly what you'd expect from a taqueria.  El Faro has other locations and they are all delicious. There are other places that do the same thing within a few blocks, but no one makes the comfort-food level tastiness like El Faro. The Happy Burrito is the go-to with all the fixings. Also open for breakfast (best hangover breakfast burrito downtown.)<//Review>

Was no where near the baseline of what a taqueria should be. Limited menu, no tamales (even though it was on the menu), and no chips?! What the...

I had the "Enchiladas" plate, which was written unclearly in the menu. It makes it seem like you get and Enchilada with a crunchy taco and 1 or 2 other sides. But it's not...

Enchiladas was ground beef, hella watery, barely any cheese. Super not worth it =\< /review>

This place has gone down hill BIG TIME!  food quality was very poor.  Service sucked.  They put 3 (not 2 or 4) tortilla chips on everyone's plate.  It's a sign of high costs squeezing all quality out of the place (my guess at least).  I'd give it 1 star if I didn't feel so bad for how far they've fallen.<//review>

Was super excited to try this place and the older lady just seem to either not like her job or like the fact that I was black. I understand Spanish so I over heard her complain to the other lady about me and the only thing I told her was what I wanted on my burrito. I can tell she thought I didn't understand because she didn't even try to be discreet about it but none the less I will not be back.</Text>

Love the breakfast burrito!  The "gravy" is what makes it, plus they cook up the eggs right in front of you as you order.  Cash only, but worth it for a quick, inexpensive breakfast.  Maybe one day I will try the lunch...< /text>

Popular taqueria for the lunch time crowd during the business week. Not an amazing burrito but it will get the job done if you're in the neighborhood and are hunkering for Mexican. I'd prefer to wait until I'm in the Mission.< /text>

<Text>This is not the best all around burrito place, but you have to know what to order! (Plus, it's a really cheap lunch in the FiDi!) Order the Al Pastor super burrito and they grill the meat right then for you, a much better option than the rest. While it might not be the best burrito in the city, it's definitely a place to try for lunch!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

< Review>
El Faro is one of the few decent places to get a burrito this side of Market Street. If this is your first time eating a burrito in San Francisco, order a baby burrito. The standard San Francisco burrito is huge and filled with rice.</Review>

<text>They need to fix there links for menu. If you click on the menu link under there address it takes you to a menu thats is wrong. If you go to there page then click on menu or order online it will take you to menu for there Kearny St which has things on then menu that the 82st address does not carry. THEY WILL CHARGE YOU A LA CARTE. I was charged $10.01 for a Super Nachos. I called back and they said they do not carry super nachos. But you can see it on the menu. It does not even look like whats in the picture. I even ordered with salsa which is missing. No sour cream. look like it was microwaved.<//text>< pictures>

Mostly good and fresh produce. Sometimes you get the soggy, a bit moist and wet deflated unfluffy bread but besides that. Good staff. Good produces. Wouldn't recommend getting toasted Herbs and Cheese bread if your sick it will be hard to swallow and may cut up your mouth / gums.
Can recommend the soups though.</Text>

My fav subway! I usually go in the evenings and have gotten to know the employees that work there. They are all very kind, the store is well kept and clean and they all make sandwiches with care (not sloppy like most other subways) no matter if I order 1 or 5 sandwiches they are always on point. Also very accommodating with my special requests. I also love the juice machine and the ice they have.</text>

< Review>
If I could give this subway ZERO stars I would! They have the worst customer service EVER! Don't waste your hard earned money here!
I wanted to save some money and use the deal Subway is offering buy 2 subs and get them for $5 each in the app. I downloaded the app however I wasn't familiar with the app and I thought I eas adding the sandwiches to my cart but instead I purchased them. In the app it says to cancel the order call the store right away so I did. The store informed me the owner and manager is not there and I have to cancel in the app. I told the employee I did not want the order do not make the sandwiches I'm going to cancel in the app. I hung up and tried again to find a way to cancel. There is no way in the app to cancel the order. I called back the store and was given the managers cell phone # I called them to cancel the order however I was told since the sandwiches were made they can not cancel. I told the manager I told the employee not to make the sandwiches that I'm not going to pick up the order. Very rudely I was told they can not cancel my order or give me a giftcard for a later date. So basically they took $40 and I have no sandwiches. I've been coming here for years but they just lost a forever customer!< /Review>

<review>The owner ( he calls himself the manager ) is very unpleasant. I’m a loyal customer, I come in often but I’m not into management or owners not treating people such as customers horrible and disrespectful. I came in my wife and I, we were in line behind a couple, they placed a order loud enough to hear, the owner was talking and not listening and when he would repeat the question of what they wanted he was rude about it and blamed the customers for not speaking loud enough. While he makes there sandwiches, he’s not wearing a mask, he’s talking to his employees over their food and he’s getting attitude with his employees. It’s just bad business. When the couple went to pay for there meal he threw their sandwiches on the counter and his body language was just uninviting. My wife and I just left and now reading the reviews, I guess were not the only ones feeling this way.

Every time I come here, for about four years now because I live down the street, I've always received wonderful service and my sandwiches are always perfect. The person making my food always asks me through the process what I want and I usually have different veggies on different sandwiches. I usually come in the afternoon and have always been helped quickly. They're always friendly. The store is always clean and I've always been happy so what can I say no complaints here. Can't beat 3 footlongs for $18 after 3pm!<//text>

The Subway is open during a remodel but they say they don't have a toilet in the bathroom. The attendant behind the counter likes cussing out loud.

Worst service ever. The girl making my sandwich didn't pay attention at all. Didnt ask if I wanted salt, pepper, oil, or vinegar, put cucumbers instead of pickles, and I didnt notice that she didnt put avocado on my Turkey, Bacon, and Avocado sandwich til i got home. Best part? She didn't give me a receipt either. I was in a bit of a hurry, but there was absolutely no one else in line. Will NEVER come back to this location.</review>

The hours for this store are posted online and on a sign by the front door. Both said 7 AM for Thursday. But when I took my daughter and her friend there for sandwiches before school, it was closed and locked. No lights and no people - so we had to go elsewhere.<//text>

<review>Don't know what is was about today but I usually go to this subway on my lunch every now and then but today went in to order a spicy sweet steak and grauc wrap and when I ask about the grauc he tells me it's extra even though  the wrap was actually called streak and grauc. Then he put sweet onion sauce on it instead of the true sweet sauce thats suppose to go on the promotional wrap for this month. Any other sandwich i would pay extra for advacado but I refuse to pay extra for something thats suppose to be included. So I end up eating it without the guacamole very disappointed. They lost a customer who has been going for almost a year.</review>< Pictures>

In previous visits this Subway store is superior to the other North area Subways. They've been there for many years and I've always enjoyed the cleanliness of their store, friendly staff and well prepared food. They're tucked in between Circle K and Baskin Robbins so the store doesn't stand out but its eaay to find.</review>

<review>I go to this subway because its the cleanest and nicest I've seen. Manager was worried about his guest and customer service. However lately there's no customer service and the sandwiches are just sloppy. I went  today and a little man helped me, very quite didnt say much almost rude and when I went to eat my sandwich I realized half of it was out the bread. REALLY U CHARGED ME EIGHT SOMETHING FOR THIS COMBO AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THERE. I even tipped u. Either way for today Im over this subway think its time to move on.< /review><user>112877906301207332815< /user>< rate>

I called and a rude man answered advising that a manager wasnt able because its lunchtime and they are busy. Did not want to help me and hung up. What a joke! No wonder people pay more for Togos.

<user_id>115895355632563871147< /user_id><text>The management here is awful. Clearly they do not know how to train efficient employees, they are scattered all over, while i was visiting this place they made me repeat myself more than 20 times. I work in customer service and i know that when i serve my customers they are always right!!!! DO NOT ARGUE WITH A CUSTOMER OF YOUR BUSINESS THEY ARE WHAT PAY YOUR BILLS!!!!!!!! When i got here they were a bit busy by the time i left the line was out the door yes it was twelve oclock but the organization of the employees was awful (there were 5 employees there at this time). they were running into each other and yelling at each other; hence why i had to repeat myself. then when i went to the manager to give a little constructive criticism,  that they maybe should have a bit more organization when they are this busy she argued with me telling me that i shouldnt tell her how to run her business then she was asking me what my business was. all i have to say is 1. never argue with a customer im bringing my money into your place of business to spend. and now i will never return, keep treating your guests like this you will for sure run yourself into the ground 2. maybe focus more on running your business efficiently  than the customers business.you cant be successful without making mistakes LEARN HOW TO TAKE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM AND LEARN FROM IT!!!
also the quality of their produce was awful they were putting brown wilted lettuce on sandwhiches and the tomatoes they were using looked like they were definitley mushy and old. BY FAR WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I would not recommend eating at this specific establishment. I LOVE SUBWAY just not this location!!!!<//text>< gmapID>

The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani is a great law office who pays attention to detail, they are organized and the staff is amazing. They made me feel as though I was apart of the family.  They work thoroughly to get the job done and they fight to get you a lot of $$$$. I recommended Jacob Emrani to all of my friends and family.  Jacob Emrani is someone who actually cares about the client and I appreciate that!!!! Thank You!!!<//text>

Thank you Mr. Emrani!!!!
My case took less than a year from intake to settlement.  Expect for Mr. Emrani to get you the money you deserve and much more. Mr. Emrani made sure the prior attorneys on my case didn’t take advantage of my settlement.  He really negotiated the best possible settlement. We got way more than I expected. In this day of when everyone to take advantage of you, expect for Mr. Emrani to handle your case with the utmost care and professionalism.  I appreciate all your hard work and knowledge to make these insurance company’s bend to your will, literally. Believe me personal injury cases and  litigation is not fun but if I’m ever, ever am involved in another accident, I won’t hesitate to call Mr. Emrani.</text>

Thank you Mr. Emrani!!!!
I am a believer in Mr Emrani 100% My son and I had a horrible Law Firm representing us at first. The attorney shouldn’t have never been given a law license in the first place. Prior to calling The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, I honestly thought the insurance wasn’t going to pay.  I took a grand leap of faith and asked Mr. Emrani to represent my son and I. Mr. Emrani takes his profession seriously and is a shrewd businessman, always keeping in touch and explaining the good and bad of our case. “NEVER EMBELLISHES AND NEVER LIES, he’s a straight shooter.” There’s no excuse with Mr. Emrani, it’s only results. My son case just settled and Mr. Emrani got us more than we thought possible. There’s a lot of attorneys out there but few that deliver what they say. Mr. Emrani is the man, don’t trust your case to just any crackerjack attorney that doesn’t know what he’s or she’s doing.  Call Mr. Emrani he has the golden touch to settle cases. I have to tell you they’re scared of Mr. Emrani, insurance companies don’t give out 6 figure settlements without a fight and litigation but our responsible party coughed it up on the first request! “If you want an attorney that represents you like a first class attorney, you shouldn’t look no further than The Law Office of Jacob Emrani.”</review>

They helped my father with his accident case. He is older, so they made sure he understood the entire process. Demia at the office was especially patient and knowledgeable and very helpful! She handled everything so quickly. She needs a raise!</review>

Jacob's office was one of the only ones willing to take my case, and got me all the medical care I needed. I worked with Armando and Hayk, who made the process relatively painless on my end. (Note- I advise you check in every so often to be kept up to date on the status of your case and make sure all parts are completed in time). The process for these kinds of things can be lengthy, but Mr. Emrani's team was able to get my case settled, my expenses covered, and got me imbursed. Overall I'm very satisfied and happy that I called Jacob.</review><Date>1622583880422<//Date>< user_id>

< review>
Last year, I was involved in a multiple car chain accident where my car ended up getting sandwiched in between two cars because of a speeding driver behind me.

My car was smashed, front and back and I had severe aches in my back and neck.

After thorough research, I found the law offices of Jacob Emrani and I’m glad I did because later the driver in front tried to pin fault on me.

I gave them a call and was impressed by how organized they were. I was able to instantly get an appointment set up and get an insight on if they would be able to help me with this situation.

Bamba was able to come to me the very next day to take down details and start my claim. He explained everything in detail and provided me his direct contact for any questions. I was pretty stunned with the customer service he provided. He had thorough knowledge about injury and accident claims and was instantly able to give me answers on the process, amount I would be looking at and time needed.

From there I was assigned an excellent case manager.
A big shout out to ‘Tatiana’ my case manager. She was the main contact for any questions I had and set me up with doctors appointments closest to where I worked/lived and fit my schedule. She followed up consistently and was very patient with the entire process.

They have good connections with plenty of medical centers, doctors, and labs which made the process even easier.
I just had to give their name at every place I went to and no further questions were asked. The bills were sent directly to them so I didn’t have to worry about losing any money upfront.

Insurance companies love to take advantage of every situation and in my case they tried everything they could to delay the repairs of my vehicle or respond in a timely manner. Team Jacob was able to handle all those challenges for me and dominated the situation.

My car was fixed within a month and they even set me up with a similar rental car so I didn’t have to worry about paying out of pocket.

I got the money for my personal injury side of the claim within a week of filing  and it was way way more than what I thought it would be.

I would heavily recommend Team Jacob.<//review>

In the past year I got hit by a car as pedestrian, an out of towner driver drove straight into my beautiful mustang head on, and 6 months later, my parents was T-Boned. My parents case got screwed up with smaller law firm and end up  owing more money to nursing home. I was extremely angry because smaller firm are new and not much of experiences in this field. I went to Wilshire Law Firm at first for my case and boy, I was wrong. But then I learned about Mr. Emrani and his team. The best team ever. I have read through lots of reviews and rating about this law firm. This is a great law firm. Average people without any knowledges of auto accident, insurance carriers, and medical fields or experiences in this area are too hastily assumed that everything need to be done now, with snap of a fingers, and'/or it should happens right away and now. Well, it doesn't work that way. Rome wasn't built in a day. So as this process. Court case takes even longer, even months. Those negative reviews were falsely stated. These people don't know how the law work or process of insurance investigation into each accidents and all they do is complaints. When they quits and went to another law firm, the same process happens all over again. All you do is waste your own settlement money, more time, and paying even more for the second, third, and even 7th firm in fees. My two accidents taught me how to be patience and understood patience is required from me so these attorney and case manager can do their job and in the end I received large settlements The process takes lots and lots of time. Case manager handles more than a dozen of cases per day and all the time. These attorneys worked their butts off fightitng in courts, on the phone going at it against the opposing counsel to get each client the best settlements outcomes, for you. So when people calls into the office all the time and demands everything happened right away. It doesn't and attorneys or case manager not ignoring you. They only moving as fast as insurance companies and medical providers moving speed, such as hospital, they are the slowest in response. Just email your case managers, it is the quickest response time. Insurance carriers not just going to cough up money for you just because you got hit, their goals is to not offers you any money or low balling your case. They takes their time in investigation and research to see how much your case entitled, $$$$. Jacob and his team fights for you everyday until they get the max settlement for your csse.
Please be patience and this law firm will take care of your case with best outcomes. I recommend this law firm over small firm. Thanks</review>

<UserId.>115576364943074193593<//UserId.><review>I am writing in reference to case manager Yanira Benitez whom I’ve know for over 7 years. I also had the pleasure of supervising Yanira at another law firm. She has consistently proven herself to be a loyal and a dedicated individual in both her professional and personal life. I can honestly say that she leads by example. Both her coworkers and loved ones look up to Yanira and are inspired by her work ethic and dedication.

In both professional and personal realms, Yanira is a leader. She is able to communicate with people and get the job done.

Adding Yanira Benitez to your organization is a wise decision. She is a hard worker, professional and loyal. She is a dynamic worker who goes the extra mile. Yanira is the definition of a go-getter. There is no task that she cannot complete.

It is a great honor for me to know Yanira and it was a privilege working with her on a professional level.

Sincerely,
Mike T.</review><username>michael tatevosian<//username></record></dataset><record>

They are still holding on to my money even after the case with my kids accident has settled. 5 years later. Good luck trying to get a hold of anyone who knows what they  doing after the initial consultation. Jacob is a absent lawer. He needs to stop advertising and work on his infrastructure i.e customer service. Beware of this law firm they will leave you high and dry and never ever follow up with you keeping your money and giving excuses.< /text>

I called and talked to some secretary not even a paralegal or attorney. She told me that I couldn't even talk to anybody because the collision was a rear Ender where the person brake checked my fiance causing her to hit that person via insurance scam. Nothing I could say would let them let me talk to an attorney. I give Jacob Emrani's law offices only one star that way I could leave a review. We are not automatically at fault because somebody brake checks you. The law is clear on that and Mr. Emrani, if you get this message, I invite you to call me.<//review>

<Review>I wonder why isn’t the owner of the firm answering any of the recently bad reviews? But they are true think twice before you sign your case to them.
I should have listen to what one of their ex employees told me when I called and I quote “ look this is my last week here. So I can’t tell you anything else other then your case could be in good hands or you might think of getting another firm” Which I should have seen the red flag since my case kept on getting passed around.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Mr. Jacob and his team were truly professional. If you had a question, or you need a piece of information about anything on your case, they were there to tell you nothing but the truth about what you needed to know. They put a lot of their time and effort into my case to get fair compensation. The good part was they don't make you feel like others or a client only, made you feel like a close friend and puts a smile on your face. I am forever grateful to them during a difficult time in my life.<//Review><Name>Zella Bailey</Name>< time>

I must admit that it has been quite a roller coaster. Wanting a quick resolution and with tensions that arise along the way make things even more difficult for everyone involved. Communication is key even when patience is minimal. Jacob can be very difficult at times, but he knows what he's doing and has always tried to solve any problem that I felt did not receive adequate attention. I appreciate the work this firm has done and continues to do for me. Thank you.< /Text>< pictures>

I had a very good experience with this law office. Denise the case manager has been in contact with me for 2.5 years while my case was getting settled. She was texting and answering my messages promptly when I had questions. It’s very pleasant that Jacob assigns a case manager who will be caring about your case as he flights behind the back door for you to get every penny he can squeeze out of them.

Highly recommend Jacob and his team.

Yes, cases don’t get settled within a couple months but guess what it is so worth it to wait to get double the compensation you deserve as Jacob pushes back and forth on initial offers and 2nd rounds.< /Text>

I am so happy with this firm and it’s staff, attorney Emrani is excellent, a special thanks to Claudia Flores for working so diligently on my case and always treating me with the utmost respect and professionalism.

Jacob and his team help me throughout the process of my case. They treated me like family, and I was never left dark on my case. They were very professional, creative, knowledgeable, and outcome-oriented with a proven track record of success. I would refer to any serious personal injury client to them. Highly Recommended!< /Review>

<Date>1584559846802</Date><rate>1< /rate><Review>Odalys, Annette, Bomba, and the receptionist are very condescending and rude. I have waited for over a month for their help. Every time I call it’s a different excuse and accusations that are not true. The receptionist hung up on me after screaming at me. I was told that those are the only people I am allowed to talk. No one ever worked on my case or came to see me. No one would return my calls. Annette sent me nasty text messages, Odalys sent me a nasty email, and Bomba called to make appointments that he never kept. Then when I call after a month of the same round about issues I am told that I received a disengage email, which never received by the way, because they have been unable to communicate with me. My apologies, but this is not how you do business and I will be reporting your firm to the BAR Association.< /Review>< pics>

<text>This place is a joke! Very rude customer service people.
Unless you are currently being treated, they won't take your case from another firm.
They are over rated just because they signed with the Lakers? What does that mean? I contacted them to get a 2nd opinion like they advertised, they were so rude, i hung up because of the abuse over the phone. The aggressiveness should be towards the other party, not the customer. Get jacoby and Meyers, they are customer service focused.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Jacob Emrani and his team negotiated a settlement stemming for an automobile accident that was more than three times what I had expected!

I had Mr. Emrani's law firm in mind in case of an accident after a colleague recommended it to me.

As soon as I was struck from behind in a loaner vehicle, I contacted The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani and did not have worry about dealing with my insurance company or even the one from the other party's.

This group did an outstanding job in making sure that I got the compensation that I deserved and then some!

Thank you, Mr. Emrani!</Review>

They leave you in the blind and run a bunch of BS by you don't explain things and I have caught them in multiple lies please if you can help it DO NOT obtain them as your attorney.  Your case will be sold to another law firm that is why Jacob emrani never responds or handles any complaints or call you</review>< pictures>

In more than 5 opportunities apply for positions in the Law firm, first never respond to emails, or calls and if you follow up the manager summarizes last name FALL, he is making fun of the person, it will be because I am Latino, I born in Fl.it will be that, this is the respect towards clients?,He gives me the cell number but they blocks the numbers. Respect. That is it.<//text>

Mr. Emrani is a pillar of professionalism. I have had family members that dealt with other Los Angeles personal injury attorneys and have gotten mistreated and even ripped off. This was not the case with Jacob Emrani's firm. Not only was my settlement expedited, but either he or one of his associates was always in communication with me. Hopefully I won’t have to seek his assistance again, but I will always keep him in my contact list in case I ever get in another car accident. Many thanks.</text>

I will say that I have not always been happy with this law firm, but I have tried to put myself in their position...for 1. I realize I’m not the only client, also not being a professional schemer I personally wouldn’t know how the workings of a law office goes that being said I realize I had to show patience , but as unhappy as I’ve been in the past  I’ve brought 3 cases to this firm... and just like any other big company you have some employees that occasionally drop the ball, they have settled  3 cases for me plus my moms case which makes 4, I can say the settlements were I think probably pretty good, but I do want things done when I want them done, my  car accident was settled at $97,000 2 months ago which I’m waiting for payment, but I explained that I lost my job to a guy named Manny last week who’s doing the break down for my case that I’m no longer able to pay my bills and I didn’t want to lose my good credit ratings... Manny called me to offer an advancement to me in order to keep my credit rating and I really appreciated that, hopefully I won’t need a lawyer again but if I did I’m sure I’d return to them oh and I did call some of the other firms Jacoby and Myers and a few others who didn’t give me the time of the day.< /Review>

This is definitely best law firm! The lawyers here were all knowledgeable, professional and truly cares a lot about their clients. My brother got himself involved in an accident so we called to this firm. They were always on top of things and was with us every step of the way. Their passion to help their clients get what they deserve is what made me decide to give this company five stars!</Review>

1st off let me say that I don't usually spend time with 2star rattings for businesses but enough is enough.its about 45days shy of the 2yr date that was given to me by an attorney that is taking care of the case.im no lawyer but the guy who hit is took full responsibility and liability at the scene it's in the police reports and statements that he thought the light was green and sun was in his eyes, open and shut case, you would think.the truck was a total lose, that was paid out within weeks Dr.appt, chiropractor,pain management and everything else that was asked of us to do,keep in mind I was and still am in pain and my work was affected by this and quality of my well being. I was told that my medical bills totalled$6100.00 but the insurance only covers$6000.00 what sense is that? I'll be owing$100.00 and not going to get anything for my missed work days the pay I lost due to Dr.Appt.and other medical treatments I would love to change all the negativity in this review, I hope that it's going to get better, it sure as hell can't get worse</Review>

The receptionist are rude. The negotiators don’t know what there talking about they give you the runaround and give you the wrong dates and take a long time to get a hold of. They don’t answer the phones at all they always tell you that they will call you back for an update and never do. I’m still waiting for them to send me all my medical records that I requested a year ago. I don’t recommend these lawyers to no one.< /text>

<Text>Finally justified!  Jacob fight for me  and he really stood by me. He's honest, smart, and approachable. We were in quite a jam for months and they got the best results possible. Without your help we would be sunk after the accident. I highly recommend Jacob without  any reservation.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Worst firm ever! Long, drawn out case. Now in payment phase and giving every excuse in the book to not pay me out when they have had the check in their hands for a month now. Except for the initial part of retaining them the communication has been trash, very hard to get a hold of someone by email or phone, always get sent to Voicemail with rare calls back. The employee turn around rate is unlike anything I've ever seen. Case gets passed along so many times no one can really just give you information without researching your case. one star because I can't give any less.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7cf9f44025f:0xc5e405e41b867be3< /GmapID></record>

<Review>U know I have him a five star review because I truly felt that his office is competent in what they are doing. It upsets me that no matter how much I call I still do t get a straight answer or response and the employees want to blame it on being short staffed what upsets me is when u talk to someone they DON'T TAKE NOTES. How can u run a successful business on a business into which NOTES  is apart of It? Problem I now have is still haven't received an email and check won't be disbursed like they said it would now I gotta drive out Monday take time out of my life which gas been destroyed because of the incompetence of his employees. I have pictures so if Mr. Emrani would like to see so he can handle this properly this is poor excuse for time management and not properly following up on what you are supposed to do how do I recommend someone to him if this is how u run your office?</Review><user>105404610556499679750</user></record>

One star rating , not for performance but for making me take a day off to clarify a matter that doesn't include me.     I will happily give them a five-star as soon as this matter gets resolved to my satisfaction.  As the gentleman attorney that attended to me kept saying "all in good faith".

Addendum/ follow up

The guy never called me back to follow up with my concern(s) as he said he would even after I tried to get a hold of him several times.  This place blows unless you have a bone with the scent of money attached to it.
Too bad that they don't have enough courtesy to someone that they wrongfully served versus someone, client,  that they can get money from or for.

Emrani, your office @#&$@!</text>

He runs a very "upscale" Legal Practice, but actually took the time to drop in to the office where my claim was being processed, just to be sure that I was getting the best possible interview with one if his amazing  Legal Assistants.</Text>< pics>

Me and my dad got into an accident and we had difficulties regarding our claims. It's thanks to Jacob that we were able to get exactly what we needed. Always followed up with us throughout the entire process. This made us less stressful than it should be and we are so happy to have him handle our case. Would highly recommend him to others!< /review>

I had a simple case where I was rear ended,  and next month will be one year that they took my case. I wouldn't recommend anyone to them because they lack customer service,  no dedication to service!!!!.

This by far the worst Attorney out there! Don’t be fooled because you see billboards promoting him. I have been dealing with them for two years and nothing! I say them because I have never even spoken to an actual attorney just many different paralegals or receptionist.< /text>

<Text>Stop Looking... He's your guy!!!
I am very thankful to find the Law Office of Jacob. We had a case that was handle by another attorney's office and they were the worse.
The old attorneys were rude, treated us like kids at times, didn't return our calls, took months to take care of a simple issue, and many other things that made it immposible for us to keep working with them.
Then a family member told us about Jacob and his team, and let me tell you it was the best decision we could have made. They were responsive, handled our case in a fraction of the time our old attorneys did, and got us the settlement we were looking for.
I dealt with Any and she was wonderful to work with and made things easy for us...
Thanks Guys.

<Review>Don’t trust this lawyer. They will try to blame you for there negligence.I had Workman comp case . They left hanging 3 yrs out my life . If you ask for bar number and prove neglect. They will drop you and lie to you about what your signing. All paperwork you plan on signing have another lawyer review it before signing. You can call they have high turn around on employers you will be passed from person to person. Most time you will be talking to answer machine and won’t return emails. With no knowledge of where your case starts or left off. After I was dropped I finished in few minutes what I waited six months for, simply sending info from one person to the next. They sent me to doctors appointment I did not need. Waste of time. 3 years I can’t get back. Now I have no faith in lawyers my first and last. They will lie to you every chance they get they do not own up or try to make anything right. Quick to blame others or you for not doing anything. Of course no case is the same. I had video like in some cases insurance companies try to prove the extent of your injury by video you walking 7lb dog I was smiling because full of pain pills . I guess your not aloud have a good day. Doesn’t mean I wasn’t in pain. BEST ADVICE YOU EVER GET FIND ANOTHER LAWYER.IT WLL MAKE YOU SICK EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIS BILLBOARD Or COMERCIAL KNOWING HE HAS DONE THIS TO SO MANY PEOPLE.

Do not believe in his words in commercials. He is a liar and took 70% from my compensation. I end up with less money while he promised that he can get me a lot. He took all the money for himself and I know he didn't work a lot on my case. He just left my case open, I had to call to his office every day to ask what is going on, as everyone who leaves bad reviews, they will never call you back at all. He claims that he took good care of me but this is false. Will not hire him again. Freedom of Speech and Article 19.

REPLYING BACK TO THE COMMENT FROM "OWNER"
Responding back to "the owner," there is no point for me to contact you because I know you are not going to help me with anything. I am not going to listen to your reasons and just accept my bad reviews. You are a liar and don't trust you at all.<//text>

< Review>
I was in a situation where I was in a car wreck. The other person’s family member came to the scene of the accident and assaulted me. I was hospitalized in the emergency room with bleeding internally from my brain . I had called the offices of Jacob Emrani because I have heard him on the radio and also seen billboards. However, one of his attorneys was annoyed because I was contacting him at 1am from the hospital shortly after the assault with a deadly weapon occurred . This is serious criminal case and also there is personal injury involved however the attorney had such a lack of empathy, I have decided to retain an different attorney. Absolutely avoid!<//Review>

I have been working with them since I believe December of 2017 and even though my case was settled a month and a half ago, I still have yet to recieve my payment. All work is done by paralegals and they are almost impossible to get ahold of. It seems like they dont do any work on your case unless you call and continuously harass them about it. My hospital bill went to collections and has been collecting interest, and they still cannot keep me updated about what they plan to do about it. They didn't bother following up on or investigating certain aspects of the accident that would have changed my settlement drastically. I would rate zero stars if I could, avoid at all costs< /review>

I've read the reviews and the ones that give a bad review you know what im talking about. Yes they're crooks and will take you for the money they say they're trying to get for you. Actually they're getting it for themselves. Maria handled my case. Mario if you try to talk to him they threaten to take longer on your case. They cheated me out of $8000. Or more. Saying i owed Ahcccs. I got paper work from hospital saying i owed them nothing . i also spoke to Ahcccs they said i owed them 0. They even called and faxed the paperwork. But they dont care. They'll charge you anyways. So why did i take the money? Necessity. I had bills, electricity was gonna be shut off. Im disabled get very little from SSA. They dont care they will cheat and lie. And threaten to take longer on your case. Thank you Mr Harris for trying to help me. He even knew they were cheating me out of the money. He was my chiropractor. He said were the biggest crooks ever. Mario lied to him saying they were not charging me for something i cant think of it. But he straight lied. He was on speaker phone so i heard. They dont care they will take the money they supposedly are getting for you. I could go on and on but i wont. You should get the picture. If your thinking of hiring them them DON'T, big mistake. They will lie and cheat to get most of the money and give you chump change.<//Text>

I was referred to Jacob. I was in an accident in my mother’s car, which was totaled, even with cops saying the other car was at fault for failing to stop before crossing a straight away. The other parties insurance faught it. LET ME MAKE CLEAR THAT I WAS 6 MONTHS PREGNANT AT THE TIME IN THE FRONT SEAT WHERE THE OTHER VEHICLE STRUCK THE FRONTPASSENGER TIRE. My 2yr old was also in th backseat!!!! I was rushed by ambulance to the er for immediate back pain. Within 2 wks from accident I needed an mri which did not have good results and resulted in the form sending me to physical therapy which I could do much for being pregnant. After having my baby, I had 3 more physical appts and then stopped as they wanted “to close the case”. My baby IS NOW 15MONTHS OLD and we have not settled or been compensated! This is way beyond ridiculous and UNPROFESSIONAL. I love in San Bernardino now and will be taking a trip in this rain tomorrow to go into the office and I will not be leaving without an answer. We have contacted through email and phone very numerous times and no response. Between these almost 2 years, the last we spoke to anyone was in July that the case would be settling in the next 30days. Unfortunately that was a major lie. The accident brang me great anxiety and a fear now being in a vehicle. The fact that I was PREGNANT and the impact was to my side is NOT OKAY!!!!!!!!!!!!<//text>

Jacob Emrani and his staff has been very patient with me and my wife's even after we constantly called them about settling our cases.  Jacob and his staff seriously give it their all when having their clients back. We settled and. are now getting our lives back on track thanks to Jacob Emrani.</review>

I will never retain this attorney ever again. Didn't helped me at all and just took most of my compensation money. Won't call you, left my case inside the cabinet, no courtesy calls, and deduct money every time I called to them.  I regret for hiring Jacob and I should have hire other attorney.<//Review>

Only because I can't give a lower score. This so called lawyers office is the worst. DO NOT USE THEM FOR ANYTHING. This office will rob you. Give you fake papers to sign & give you only a portion of your settlement.<//Review>

<Text>Everything was a complete mess I transferred from on bullshit lawyer to the next we finally settled the case but got told this day it's ready but then it wasn't signed. Then  had to wait an extra week or so to actually get the money due to the fact that Jacob wasn't anywhere to be found to sign the check.... Very unorganized business only gave it a star so I can comment... No star is really needed< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><time>1469828020781</time>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) It looks like the best lawyer and solidarity with a cause (breast cancer) but it is an exploitative farce with the employees who have at home they work more than 15 hours a day without resting the domestic of their house they take it to clean all the houses of their family without paying a five more and have no bed to sleep like a person so you can be like a good lawyer and defender

(Original)
Luce como el mejor abogado y solidario con una causa (cáncer de seno) pero es una farsa explotador con los empleados que tiene en su casa laboran mas de 15 horas diarias sin descansar la doméstica de su casa la llevan a limpiar todas las casa de su familia sin pagar un cinco mas y no tienen cama donde dormir como una persona así puede estar como un buen abogado y defensor< /Text>

<review>Casual Chinese restaurant with amazing service.  From what I've heard, the regular server was away for a month so, they had help from the owners daughter.  She was truly amazing! We wanted to order something that was not on the menu and was able to special order it with no issues at all. This was our first time eating here and we were definitely happy we chose this establishment.  We ordered salt and pepper squid (special order), general tso chicken, pork fried rice and shrimp with (Chinese) broccoli.  Not only was the service great, the food was also delicious, to top it all off, prices were definitely fair.  We know some restaurants that would have charged us double of what we spent with mediocre tasting dishes. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Hope they keep up their great food and excellent customer service.< /review>< Time>

Food was good, I noticed prices were increased  and then they still wanted to charge extra to substitute an item, I probably won't be back anytime soon unless I am in that area and starving!</review>

We were craving Chinese Food and were looking for someplace new. We found this place on Google, saw the great reviews. We were not disappointed, they are worth every star! The prices are very reasonable. We got one of the family meals. More than enough food! It was DELICIOUS. It was served quickly. The staff was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was pleasant. We will definitely be back and now will consider this a favorite place.<//Review>

I order chow main,  brocolli and beef work ton and the food didnt have any flavor. I feel like the food is less oily and it has no flavor.  I really didn't enjoy my food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. I think all the 5 starts are lies<//Text>

Choose a seat! The customer service was great. They could use more than one waiter but the waiter who help us did a great job mananging a room full guest and take our orders. Chicken chop suey, sweet and sour pork, fried rice was delicious.

We will be back!<//Text>

They also have the best pretzel bites and cheese dip! When I come here it’s like being in the comfort of my own home (if I had a giant t.v.). I would 100 % recommend this theater. We come here even though century 16 is down the street from our house.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80e849edfe86f5af:0x7acb3aded04ca4f6< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>While somewhat pricey, the seats are lavish recliners with tons of space between seats and between rows. The concessions stand has a decent mix of traditional fare and some pleasing additions, like hot cinnamon roll bites and coffee. The theater itself is reasonably clean; parking is usually available just putside the front.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Definitely recommend the unlimited pass. Two movies a month and it's paid for. I have it and It's better than what movie pass was. Unlimited movies for sure.</text>

This theater is under new management, you can’t buy tickets at the front no x office, only at the concession stand which makes the food line really long, like 10-15 minutes.
The soda tastes quite badly as they don’t purify their water enough.
The only reason I did my give it 1 star is that they have recliner seats which are quite comfortable.
I definitely recommend buying your tickets on line and bringing in your own snacks</text>

<pics>None</pics><text>Camarillo Edwards has wide, comfortable recliner seats that make movie watching enjoyable for most people.  Contrast that with Century Park 16 over at the Collection, which seems to have replaced its seats with seats that seem as narrow as they were 30 years ago.  My only knock on Camarillo Edwards is that you have to climb a long stairway to access their restrooms.  Recommend you go before!</text>< Resp>

It was good, reason for the 4 stars is because the lights were still on the first 10 mins of the movie kind of annoying<//Text>

They need to recalibrate the contrast. Everytime I go there, the screen is way, WAAAAAY too dark, and it's impossible to see any detail in the movie you're watching. I live that theater, but id rather spend my money somewhere else so that I can actually see the movie. And don't even get me started on the sound quality because that sucks to. I wish I could take pictures of the screen to show everyone what I mean but can't.<//text>

<Review>This is my favorite theater around my area. They have the best seating with reclining chairs. It is always clean and the staff is friendly. They also have the best pretzel bites and cheese dip! When I come here it’s like being in the comfort of my own home (if I had a giant t.v.). I would 100 % recommend this theater. We come here even though century 16 is down the street from our house.<//Review>< Pics>

While somewhat pricey, the seats are lavish recliners with tons of space between seats and between rows. The concessions stand has a decent mix of traditional fare and some pleasing additions, like hot cinnamon roll bites and coffee. The theater itself is reasonably clean; parking is usually available just putside the front.</review>

Definitely recommend the unlimited pass. Two movies a month and it's paid for. I have it and It's better than what movie pass was. Unlimited movies for sure.</review>

This theater is under new management, you can’t buy tickets at the front no x office, only at the concession stand which makes the food line really long, like 10-15 minutes.
The soda tastes quite badly as they don’t purify their water enough.
The only reason I did my give it 1 star is that they have recliner seats which are quite comfortable.
I definitely recommend buying your tickets on line and bringing in your own snacks</text>

Camarillo Edwards has wide, comfortable recliner seats that make movie watching enjoyable for most people.  Contrast that with Century Park 16 over at the Collection, which seems to have replaced its seats with seats that seem as narrow as they were 30 years ago.  My only knock on Camarillo Edwards is that you have to climb a long stairway to access their restrooms.  Recommend you go before!</Text>

It was good, reason for the 4 stars is because the lights were still on the first 10 mins of the movie kind of annoying<//Review>

Everytime I go there, the screen is way, WAAAAAY too dark, and it's impossible to see any detail in the movie you're watching. I live that theater, but id rather spend my money somewhere else so that I can actually see the movie. And don't even get me started on the sound quality because that sucks to. I wish I could take pictures of the screen to show everyone what I mean but can't.< /text><Rate>1< /Rate><gmapID>0x80e849edfe86f5af:0x7acb3aded04ca4f6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had a fantastic time working with this family owned business! I was visiting the area with my dog and took her to get groomed at the Petco in the shopping plaza across the street. As I was pulling into the plaza my car had a light turn on and my car just shut off. I was definitely nervous about being in an area I wasn't too familiar with. I turned my car back on and was able to get in to the plaza and dropped my puppy off for her appointment. I got a recommendation from a kind woman in Petco grooming to check out A Plus on the corner, they will take great care of you! I walked over and was greeted by BASTO! He heard my story, gave me his card and said no worries, get your car here or call me and I will come and give it a jump and help you get it to the shop. I walked back and was able to get the car to turn on and drive into the shop. They did a diagnostic and helped me figure out I needed a new battery and found a part that needed to be fastened back on. Basto took great care of me and got everything in working order. I was checked out with Lyn, Basto's sister, and found out that the place was family owned and Lyn was so kind and walked me through a special auto service that worked like Triple A if I am ever in need and not nearby the shop, I could call this service and they will help me get the assistance or tow I may need! I got all my questions answered. Everyone was so kind and patient and I felt like I was a part of the family! I 100% recommend A Plus Smog and Auto Repair and when I officially move to LA I will return if I have any future issues with my car! I was even told I have a 3 year warranty on my battery and I could have my battery replaced Free of charge! THE SERVICE HERE WAS IMPECCABLE!! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!!! Thanks for making me feel welcomed and cared for!!!< /review>

Absolutely BEST mechanic around!  You will not find a more reliable and honest mechanic so if there is an issue with your car you definitely want to bring your car here!

This is a family owned shop that's been in business for over two Decades and they really care about their customers and are willing to go the extra mile to help.  Whether that's by checking that light on your dash, answering any questions or just doing a really good job on your car.

You can expect great service and an honest professional approach when you come here.< /review>

<Review>They tell you everything they plan to do before they do it. They have good process and are very professional. After I got it fixed they even printed me out an estimate on parts and labor on things I should consider fixing because the mechanic didn't "like how it was working" (heater). Definitely coming back.< /Review>< pictures>

Please read this whole story,

Not only was the service incredible, they also do a great job keeping you updated on what exactly they’re doing. They also saved me a tow truck ride by driving out to my car and making sure it was OK for me to drive to their shop, plus put oil and coolant in to be safe. Not one time did I see these guys stop working and I was here the whole time.

After learning the problem and realizing that they were going to keep my van overnight (which is where I’ve been sleeping) The mechanic took me to the planet fitness across the street and used his membership card to get me in so I could shower. He even waited for me to finish.

These are the kind of people you want working on your car. Honest, caring hard working people. This is where I will be taking my vehicles from here on out.  I suggest you do the same.</Text>

<Text>Go somewhere else these people are sloppy mechanics! I had some work done to my car here about a month ago where they had to remove my bumper and change out my headlight ballast and today I did the oil change on my car and found a lot of screws missing, I've had my car for 8 years and I have always done my own oil change so I know the routine of removing my undercarriage covers. The splash guard underneath the engine had exactly 16 screws to remove and it only had four one for each corner today when I uninstalled it. That's complete BS no mechanic should be so lazy as to not take the time to reinstall all the screws who knows what else they did to my car half fast. Go somewhere else!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Although they do seem honest told me exactly what the problem might be they did overcharge unfortuneately i didn't have time to look anywhere else and was just recommended by a relative I was charged 126 for the front headlight to work (wiring problem) and the taillight was around 250 so in total was around 4oo something.. well later on I go home and find my taillight not working again.. it worked at the beginning...on and off and the mechanic then calls me and says he saw the taillight not work when i drove off.. ok i think... what else oh yeah he left a tool in my car.. and im thinking what the heck there wasn't anything i checked it before i got out.. anyway he suggest he drop by my house and check for that tool when he comes by he tightens my tire and semi fixez the taillight again and says he will order a new one?? what the hell wasn't it supposes to be like new?? so here i am the taillight works but unsure how long it will last i still have yet to go there. to get it permanently fixed and most likely will never go again after that btw the obd diagnostics was 45 although i didn't need it....<//Text>

These smoothies are gigantic. Lots of options and most of them are not made with sorbet! Also, you can get breakfast and lunch here too, as there are tons of sandwiches. The workers were very nice.<//text>

While we were waiting in line we saw that the employee had the mask completely under his chin while making the food. Why are the customers required to wear mask but the employees aren't? The place also had a very strong bad smell. It kind of smelled like a lot of old stagnant water. We decided to leave before ordering.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The best acai bowl I've ever had! Every time I come here it gets better and better. Highly recommend them. Super friendly and there's a cute little pigeon outside.. he enjoys the peanut butter. Acai bowl with peanut butter is delicious!<//text>

Delicious and consistent whichever location you go to they are all great! I really wish there was a San Diego Blenders in National City! I love their sandwiches and smoothies I could eat at San Diego Blenders everyday! Their staff are always nice and their service is great! Never have to wait too long even if it busy and their special sauce is the best!!< /Text>

<Review>How amazing is this place, I have eaten at all their locations and they all always taste just as good anywhere I go. Amazing staff always smiling and super friendly. Have you tried their World Famous “Brazilian Bowl”, or need one with a scoop of peanut butter (my personal favorite), or some fresh squeezed green juices? This is the place and by far the best San Diego has to offer.  In town visiting or on a vacation, guarantee you this is a one of a kind menu you won’t taste anywhere else!  Check out any of their locations they’re all amazing!<//Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Parking is a challenge at peak lunch hour, so if you are in a hurry it is best to order ahead and bring a friend to run in for the order while you double park or circle round.<//text>< Pics>

Came here with friends and ordered the Brazilian açaí bowl. It was super watery, with some frozen chunks not blended. The fruit on top was grapes, apple slices and pineapple, but it was basically like paying $8 for a small, cold fruit soup (see picture). There weren’t any prices on the menu so that was also annoying.</Text>

Been here twice and both smoothies tasted like they were made out of fruit flavors ice cream. Do you have smoothies that are healthy? If so, I am happy to come back and try it and hang my rating. If you want a fruit flavored milkshake, this would be your place.</text>

Seriously the best place in the whole world!
SD Blenders never disappoints. Way better juice than any corporate just spot. They go smoothies, and bowls and sandwiches too.</text>< username>

< Review>
$9.95 for an acai bowl? Yikes. No thanks. The price isn't even listed, so your left GASPING at the register. My friends jaw dropped but she tried to play it cool as a tear shed for her bank account. Think the smoothies are any better? Think again. My friend asked for no honey, and what does she get? Honey. Drizzled on every single bite. She asked for a side of peanut butter and was charged an extra like 2 dollars and almost didn't get it without asking for it again. In a nut shell, San Diego Blenders ruined me. Friends, lives, and wallets left in smitherines.< /Review>

Great place for protein smoothies. They put 28 grams of whey or soy protein in some of their smoothies but you can add them to all. Also good açai bowls and sandwiches. Perfect place for a sunny day and cravings for something fresh.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>So, My wife and I went into this establishment so that she can order a smoothie and be on our way. We walked in, I sat down, and my wife ordered her drink (which took the female clerk quite some time to acknowledge in an empty store!) After her drink was made the female clerk hands my wife her drink, then looks past my wife and yells, "Sir, what are waiting on!?",(not, "can I help you?", or "did you need something?" or "are you going to order?") as I was sitting there waiting for my wife, and minding my own business. My wife quickly had to let the clerk know that we walked in together. Her response towards a potential customer was not just rude, but unprofessional. I'm sorry if this is a favorite for many of you, but that experience alone is enough for me to clearly see how people who don't meet certain criterias (or looks) are treated here. And, yes, though it's a bit of a cliche, I was actually hurt and appalled by the experience.It seems as though starbucks isn't the only place that is racial profiling these days.(plus, my wife said the smoothie wasn't even that good.)<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmap_id>

The brazillian bowl is the best thing here. The large is pretty pricey but it's worth it! Get it with extra honey.< /review>

<text>Great staff and large variety of smoothies. Killer Combo for when I start feeling sick :), includes 4 shots-style drinks. Ginger/garlic/beats/wheatgrass/carrots  (this is most of the ingredients split into 4 different drinks). Baja Guava is a favorite, Guava Bull if you want to include red bull in your drink. There are smoothies that include 28grams of whey protein, and others just have a variety of healthy fruits  (acai berries for example).

Give this place a visit, drinks are around $5-7, if I recall correctly, depending on size.</text><UserId.>103961284947007220091</UserId.><username>sub zero< /username><date>1470066824223< /date><GmapID>0x80d955b7f66baae9:0x4418cdf2881534e8<//GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

This store is nasty! You walk in and there is stuff sitting all over. It doesn't even look professional!
It's definitely a hole in the wall!! And the workers are lazy and walking around with no energy and not smiling and not greeting people when they walk in.
I would never go here again! Yuck! 1 star.
Out of the 3 San Diego blender locations, this location is the worse I've seen! The other 2 locations are so nice! SDSU & Santee!
Santee is phenomenal!!! 10 stars for santee! Right next to Home Depot.<//Text>

<Review>Can you say yummers? I know I can after having a small size of that mango, raspberry and banana smoothie at San Diego blenders. I paid every half cent of $3.45 for this, and that price included the two extras I got. I asked for this smoothie to be topped with (as opposed to blended in with) granola and coconut. at first, I was disappointed because I had asked them to sprinkle my smoothie with pecans or walnuts; which they told me that they didn't have(perhaps they were just out of them?), but I decided to accept the granola as a topping. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the granola topping included a really good amount of sunflower seeds, which you would think they would have mentioned -as I was looking for some type of nuts or seeds -basically something crunchable.. But whatever ...I got what I wanted. I am glad I stopped by, and I will be back. The small size filled me up, and in my opinion, 3 dollars and 45 cents is a fair amount up to pay for feeling like I've been nutritionalized and refreshed from fresh fruit and not from a from concentrate, powdery drink.*clears throat* aahem.."jambajuice"< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Disgusting place. Dust bunnies all over the floor under the seating area, filthy tables, shitty  customer service. Yummy food, tho. this place desperately needs new management. it has a lot of potential and seems to have somehow gone downhill from previous times.</review>

I tried the sweet pork, because I didn't think it was literal. My enchilada was just odd. The pork had been sweetened to dessert level. So my bad. I will not be having it again.

The Tres Leches cake was quite delicious. I could see stopping in just for that!< /review>

<review>First time here. Enjoyed the experience. The sweet pork has a delicious flavor that's very different from other similar style restaurant chains. And having the burrito wet was new and refreshing to me in the fast food setting. I like that they have all-you-can-drink horchata at the soda fountain. Love horchata, hate paying extra for a refill.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU4spR0gRQeCTTi_3hYIDC8_xR6hlhRt7Oh7Pg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuftGu3UhJsQGstAC5a-XBqJg3-KTlGfXGwMJO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVIs3jXSvOUZmTX3UdbNIsTsYIl2gGKtxZozbV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< userid>

They only care about moving the line. They don't care if your order is messed up. Food is old and cold.<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>'20/2 1st review, but customer a half dozen times over the past few years:
-- Always consistent cleanliness inside/out, food quality, and service as all of these fast-casual dining franchises I've also patronized.
-- Amazing, individual serving key lime pie--unique to Costa Vida.
-- Simple, cinnamon/sugar, single, small tortilla for $1 (also included in kid's meal) totally hits the spot taming one's sweet tooth with demolishing one's wallet--also unique to Costa Vida. [p.s. don't let the poor picture appear deter you from trying this!]
-- Yes high chairs (2)
-- Single sex bathrooms.
-- Plenty of free parking.
-- Handicap parking note: the store occupies the corner unit of building/strip-center. The handicap parking is four stores south, so be prepared to walk [see evening pic posted].</Text>< Pics>

<username>Kevin Williams</username><review>Food was good. Place was terrible--an accumulation of small things. Two of the four doors were locked...we had to keep trying to get in. The place was virtually empty, and while we waited to be helped (it's basically like a Chipotle), the person working behind the counter walked past us a few times, but didn't acknowledge that she would be a moment, much less actually come help us. When she did, she was unfriendly and quiet. With every question she asked (beans, cheese, etc), I had to ask her to repeat herself. I can't always hear well...that part is me...but she never once raised her voice to help me out. They have no chip reader, so my card didnt work on the swipe. She typed it in and said it was declined (I used it at Starbucks 30 minutes later).  I asked her to try again, and she repeated that it was declined (the date is impossible to read on the card, so most likely typed in wrong).  I just paid cash and was done with it. Had to look all over the restaurant for napkins because the two closest napkin dispensers on the wall were empty. So like I said...accumulation of small things and friendliness making the visit a first and last experience.</review>< GmapID>

I come here all the time because I really do like the food and my kid does too but man, the service is abismal. They’re slow, unorganized, and sometimes rude. Usually it’s not a problem but other times it’s so frustrating dealing with this place.</text>

<review>Great place for quick fresh and delicious food. They have an every day special that includes the drink. That gives you the opportunity to taste all their dishes and get a free drink. The tres leches is the best at this location. It is made and served fresh.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Gmap_id>

I always get the sweet pork burrito. It’s delicious. Extra meat is always worth it. They have a fun take on burrito. Just don’t expect to eat it with your hands. They’re fork and knife type burritos. Service is quick and friendly. Prices are fair ($9 for sweet pork). Restaurant is always clean though if you come after lunch rush expect the condiment stand to be out of forks or sauces cups. Their horchata is so good! Get the app, it’s worth it if you go as often as l do.< /review>

<text>We've been coming here once a week for the last three years. Excellent food super friendly staff and some of the best freshest Mexican to be had. I highly recommend getting your burrito wet. All burrito add-ons are free including wet burritos except for guacamole. And the burritos are huge, you do not go home hungry!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

Food was freshly made, right in front of you.  For in house meals it's awkward to be served a burrito in an aluminum bowl.  Difficult to cut with plastic utinsils in the bowl. Food was good, though.< /Text>

[Explitive] amazing. I've been there twice and just amazing. I can't remember what I got but, one of the meats was in their house sauce, I believe. Either way just ask their recommendations they know what's good.<//Text>

< Review>
My mother ordered this Restaurant to get some food because we where tired. I orders nachos, my dad ordered a steak burrito, my mom ordered a pork  burrito, and my sister ordered a steak burrito. First of all, the cheese on my nachos was not even cheese. Its was too dry and disgusting. My sisters was ground beef WHEN SHE ORDERS STEAK. My dad ordered a steak burrito AND GOT CHICKEN. My moms was gross because the lettuce was black and burnt. I don’t think this meal was good and the chiefs where really bad.<//Review>

This was my first time here. I'm not one to write bad reviews but i feel theyre some issues that need to be addressed. This place definitely needs to retrain a few of their employees. The customer service was distasteful and the employees had a bad attitude. As I was placing my order I notice they were out of steak, onions, and bell peppers. I told the employee I dont mind waiting for the food to be cooked. With a disappointing look the employee walked to the back and left me hanging. As the employee walked off they left 2 tortillas on the grill. One of the employees working the other grill started to yell back to him to come back and finish our order. The employee responded by saying "I cant I'm busy right now" and the other employee responded "customers come first" meanwhile my tortillas were burning on the grill and the person working the other grill had to stop what they were doing to help finish my order. In the end the food was a 6 out 10. Some of the food products seemed dried up and needed to be changed out. I still plan on coming back but hopefully next time I'll have a better experience.<//review>

<Text>Not a sole in the place and the floor was sticky, food crumbs on the tables, and staff was unfriendly. The food looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for hours. Solid one star from me and my family.< /Text><userid>107878202708548536255< /userid>< username>

The sweet pork is more like pulled pork than classic Mexican, but Iiked it.  They are $4 each a la carte.  Taco Tuesday might be best for trying them out, $2 tacos.  I really liked the handmade corn tortillas.  Did not try the flour, but I am guessing they are better than pre-packaged Mission tortillas your Mama buys.< /Text>< Pictures>

It was my second time going to this place cause the first time my grilled chicken quesadilla was absolutely amazing. But unfortunately this time I order the same thing but the individual on the other side was in sort of great deal in hurry. He did not care of what I have to add to my order. It was an unpleasant lunch on my day off. I hope next time I go they'd listen. But overall it's a good place to eat lunch.<//text>

< Review>
These fews weeks has really been crazy at costa its like not the same anymore ! & I really have a lot to say about it.I felt like I was being rushed by “feliz” is what I was told her name was & It made me extremely uncomfortable & confused.Also I notice Tina Is gone Which is one of my favorites,Is She coming back? I’ve been a regular for sometime now & I think you guys should put costa how it use to be cause the way its set up right now is not going to be good in the future.<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><Text>First visit to Smashburger. Good selection and food was fresh and tasty. Sweet potato fries were excellent. Minus one star for the cost of two 'Fast food' meals (see pic). Not sure how West Coast residents survive on such high costs of gas, food, etc. Nice place to visit, but give me the Midwest for moderate prices.<//Text>< pics>

Smashburger is okay compared to other hamburger chains. After further research I found out, Smashburger is owned by Jollibee. Jollibee also have hamburgers. I'm confused with the difference🍔🤔?<//review>

Better than average fast food place, I actually think it might be the best burger I have had at a fast food place? A bit pricey tho.</review>

<Review>Really good! We ordered it for delivery based on the reviews we saw here and we were not disappointed! The smash fries were AMAZING: you need to try them! Full of flavor, we loved the garlic taste. Tots were very good too although a little to greasy/oily. Burgers were tasty and juicy! We had the regular one and the avocado one and they were perfect. We will order again!<//Review>< UserId.>

<Name>drawonnoodles< /Name><text>Something went wrong with my order if I prefer McDonald's over this. Ordered on Doordash and it came in a timely manner (~30mins) but somehow all the burgers were cold. Maybe burgers just get cold fast. When I opened the wrappers, the burgers looked flat and unappetizing. Do they assemble the burgers and then smash them? I ordered the Spicy Baja with Guac Burger. There were crispy salty bits that taste like bacon stuck all around the bottom bun. Are they supposed to be the grilled onions or the grill scraps? All three burgers in my order were so salty. The patty is not an authentic smash burger. Smash burgers are thin and crispy. These patties taste are ordinary patties from any fast food restaurant. There's nothing special so I'd rather go somewhere else.< /text><Rating>2</Rating>< Pictures>

Delicious salad and tater tots. I really liked the super tasty chicken that I added to my salad. The General Manager was very friendly and kind. He served us and cleared away our dishes. And the food was delicious. I would definitely come again!<//review>

The girl who took my order was BEYOND thoughtful and considerate after not being able to think after my virology exam today haha. Bless her. She filled in what I was thinking but couldn't say, recommend her personal recommendations when asked, and just a breath of fresh air after a long day. Definitely coming back. Oh, and the food!!! I'll let that speak for itself : )</Text>

Got the double sin burger and double original. Burgers are pretty delicious, reminds me of mcdonalds if you like that beefy flavour. The smash fries are SO good... whatever oily stuff they put on it adds a great flavour. Service was a bit slow and they forgot my 2nd patty. It was fixed pretty quickly though. Leave your tray and stuff on the table when you're done. This place is a weird mix of fast food and normal restaurant.</text>

The person who answers the phone just dropped me on the counter and I have been listening to other people order for 10 minutes. The guy who took the call asked if I could hold and took 5 peoples orders. I haven’t even tried your food but I hate your service. I am just going to keep leaving negative reviews while i wait.<//text>

Too Overpriced.

Fries Taste Like Synonym Potatoes.

Milkshake Is An Unenjoyable Sloth Of Icecream.

Burger Patties Was Just Angus Meat With No Swagger.

Packaging Looked Like A Bakery Bag.

So, They Try To Overtake An American Hustle Of Burgers Towards The Northern Americans,

But Couldn't Even Mac A Tastebud.</review>

<text>Came across this place during grocery shopping and I was pleasantly surprised.  The interior felt like a restaurant and not your regular fast food place.  Table and seats were high and there were also regular seating too.  After I ordered, I was given a number, which I took to my table.  I really liked seeing the sink by the counter, where I could just wash my hands before eating.  My burger was delivered to my table and all the condiments and napkins were at the table too. None of those little packets and napkin dispensers at the counter to mess about.  The burger was tasty and looked freshly made and all the onions and tomatoes freshly cut.  Worth a visit for a quick bite and friendly staff that keep the place clean and inviting.

I had eaten somewhat recently and wasnt overly hungry so I opted for just the single patty burger with no fries or drink but with all the toppings it was as big as a double or triple anyway and satisfying. The angus burger on special was topped with beef brisket, bacon, cheddar, and pickles and the huge stack of juicy, crisp, cheese covered meat was delicious. The pickles went well with the other salty flavors and the hearty bun had no issues handling the mountain of greasy meats. I didnt notice any of the bbq sauce I was expecting on it but they threw in a few packs of ketchup which I didnt use and it was great dry regardless.

Staff were friendly and service quick and efficient. They took every corona safety precaution I could think of with sanitizers, social distancing markers, and staff decked out in protective gear. No outdoor dining area and just carryout and delivery orders currently tho.<//text>< name>

<Review>Best hamburger i've ever tasted!! I was at Edwards cinema next door and i had a half hour to waste before the movie. Decided to find somewhere close to grab a quick bite. I ordered the "Waste em all" (pepper jack , green Chile and grilled onions) burger. Sooo good. Fries were bomb too. I wish they had a smaller size (one size only). Definitely be back again. Cool atmosphere. Friendly employees! 5 guitar stars!!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Great burgers and flavors. We ordered the mushroom burger, the Turkey burger, and double classic. They're gourmet in a fast food setting. With that said they're more expensive compared to in-n-out so I suggest to get their other burgers besides the classic. The burgers was a bit greasy so 4 out of 5 stars.<//Text>

I've seen smash burger around for years but haven't tried until today. The fries I believe are hands down the best, way tastier and crunchier. Their crispy  chicken sandwich was tasty too.< /Review>

I cannot believe I have passed by this place all the time and JUST came here. I always get strawberry milkshakes and I saw salted caramel on the menu, it was a wrap. Hands down the best milkshake I have ever had. The staff was amazing, my son's kid burger came without veggies and I asked for some basic things and they brought him a whole spread! 10/10 will be coming here again and often. The food was delicious. I had a classic smash burger and fries with no salt. Their veggies were so fresh. Exceeded my expectations!!!</Review>< rate>

So I had never been to a smash burger before today! Everything was perfect! The burger was delicious. I had the triple double pub burger for $4, which I think is an amazing deal! Didn’t even break $5 after tax. My only complaint was that the burger was too either... oily or just wet somehow. Maybe the from the onions? The customer service was amazing! The manager and the staff seemed to have a good relationship which is always nice to see. The manager also actually helped out! He went to the tables and made sure thing everything was good and he even helped me when I couldn’t figure out what to get.<//Review>

You need to pay everything by one item. Wish they had meal deals. Don't order the original coz it's just tasteless. For about $15 you can get a meal that includes burger, fries, & drink<//text>

However their burger patties are now a lot smaller by about half and they got rid of the turkey burger, which was my favorite. Don't think I'll be going as often as I have been.😞

I was pleasantly surprised by Smash Burger. I was brought by a family member who said i had to try the fries and the burgers are like home. Smash Burger did not dissapoint. I like the options and variety of bread choices. The fries are addicting as well. I would recommend it. Very satisfying.</Review>

<review>If you are not looking for a huge amount of food nut want something fresh that is delicious then consider smashburger. Food has always been fast and the tables and restroom are clean. The only reason i wouldn't give 5 stars is price. If you are used to San Francisco and what it costs to do anything, its really about par for the course, if two people with burgers and fries and a shake for a hair under $40 isn't a deal breaker then enjoy.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>I  love the food and always enjoy every  dining visit, the only complaint one can honestly lay upon this establishment  is It's almost hidden location within the shopping center because in my opinion  it is truly one of the sought after  business located in the shopping center  therefore deserving of a much higher visibility  storefront. Truly worth visiting!< /Text>< username>

Over priced and the hamburger was extremely tiny. No kidding, tiny. They do have nice onion rings and the shakes are small too but at least not so tiny as the hamburger which are really tiny. Nothing really special about the taste, it's average. I like really well cooked hamburgers and mine was very, very well done, which I prefer but if you'd like it medium to rare, at least at this place, you might be out of luck.</Review>

<Text>Greasy and delicious! Simple burgers, in a variety of combinations, beers, shakes, and rosemary tater tots. Quick service, good people, great food, and highly recommended as quality, reliable fast food.

The location was a little hard to find. The entrance is off of the large parking lot.<//Text></record>

I've been coming to Smash Burger for quite a while. I pretty much stick with their classic burger or their Cobb salad with grilled chicken. I'm not much into goat cheese and cucumbers on my hamburgers. The staff is friendly. The manager with the crew cut is a bit gruff. He's all business. But everyone is personable.< /text>

We love smashburger! My family and I have been coming here every Sunday for about a year now. The staff are wonderful! Tom and Linda are amazing! They treat us like family. The food is delicious and the options are great! There's parking which is rare for San Francisco. I definitely recommend.<//Text>

I really enjoyed my first Smashburger experience, especially after being able to get a free sandwich for buying fries and a drink with the app. There is ample parking and it's located in the former site of the San Francisco Giants' original stadium when they moved to the city 60 years ago. Gotta love some history with your burger!</Text>

<review>I deliver for doordash and that's why I was at Smashburger I wasn't impressed they got my order wrong. I waited for 15 min before they found out that my order was ready but was in the wrong name. It was a sat. Night and it wasn't busy at all. Seems like they had minimal amount of people working. I've never been to Smashburger prior to that. The menu looked pretty good. I've never been there and I was thinking about trying their burgers when I have some time. I from the service alone I don't think I will go there.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Smashburger is one of the more innovative hamburget fast food restaurant chains. The San Francisco location at the Potrero Shopping Center on 16th Street has a welcoming and friendly staff. The restaurant is open until 10 P.M. After the recent vegetable price hikes, the restaurant sadly decided ito stop offering spinach, cucumbers and avocados in its salads and as toppings of its burgers. My rating would be 4.5 or even 5 stars if that elimination of choices would not have happened.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Love the menu at Smashburger - I think smashburgers are one of the most enjoyable burger forms - with a bit of crispy crust and melty cheese. This location has good food, but it doesn't always feel safe. I've been when irate customers were yelling at each other and cars were broken into in the parking lot. They still pop out decent food - but its not my favorite spot.<//Text>

Person who rung me up shouldve mentioned the wait time, especially if over 10 min. I understand there are online orders, but when you go in and see nobody waiting you'd expect to get your meal fast. Overall great burgers.</Review>

Check your order to make sure it’s correct! The cashier Brendy tried to “upsell” me and my kids without telling us!!! We ordered two burgers and on each of them she put in the BIG size when in fact we ordered the regular size. Had to correct her TWICE. SHADY. Food is good here but after this, we won’t be returning.< /review>

Not much for vegans, their black bean burger is processed with dairy so only fries and salads for them. I had a friend who tried it and said they've had better. The have fountains for refill and the service isn't too bad considering it isn't dining.</review>

Pricey, Greasy and definitely not fast food. I had to wait 5 minutes by the cashier to place my order and there was only 1 table taken, and I was the only one in line. There was a tension between management and the kitchen staff that the customers could see and feel. The 2 starts I’m giving are ONLY in respect to the employees working on a Saturday night. Has a lot to improve, and definitely a lot of management & training issues.< /Text>

When you go to Smashburgers what you want to do like me order order a hamburger to stay because they make them better when you order a hamburger to go they just slap it together and get home that Amber is through it don't look like a hamburger it don't smell like a hamburger so take this warning order to stay and then take it home goodbye</text>

This place is in the same class as Burger Joint and Super Duper.  A premium priced fast food of better quality.  The burgers range from 6-7$ alone, with small sides of fries for around $2.
I ordered a truffle swiss chicken sandwich with smash fries (super thin fries tossed in garlic, rosemary, olive oil).  The fries were a bit over oily and salty, but were crispy and tasty.  The thinness made them not ideal vehicles for ketchup.  The sandwich looked thrown together with the bun not even covering most of the chicken, and they forgot to put veggies in it I had to bring it back.  It was also really greasy but tasted good.  I ended up with a strange stomach ache so I walked around Ross in the plaza which is extremely depressing.  Not likely to repeat here without coupon.< /text>

I think Smashburger is just splendid. For a small-ish chain (at least in terms of CA locations), they have solid burgers that taste fresh and and a good value. I really like some of their more healthy options like the chicken burgers on wheat. I can't wait to try their new burgers that have cucumbers, goat cheese and spinach on them as toppings. I personally like their Avocado Chicken Club, without mayo. They usually put a light amount of ranch on it, which I appreciate. Their chicken always comes out juicy, albeit, thin. Their sweet potato fries and smash fries are also good. I also like how they have Honest Tea brewing. I always stop by when I'm in the area running errands.</review>

I had the Pearl's Deluxe burger with everything on it, garlic fries and a chocolate Oreo shake.While the burgers are a bit overpriced for the quality, the fries and shakes are amazing. Their specialty burgers are definitely the way to go as the standard deluxe burger does not stand out in America's over saturated burger landscape.If you're a fan of the "fries + shake" indulgence and you're looking to step up your guilty pleasure game, this is the place to go.<//Text>

<Text>Can't believe it took 20 mins just to get a large fries. Not to mention when I got them they weren't fresh or salted. McDonalds across the street should have been the choice. Milkshake was good but I drank it all before I got my fries. I won't be back.< /Text><username>Camelia<//username><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

<Review>Even though I'm usually against chain restaurants in the city, I have to say this is no Macdonald's.
Phenomenal service, tasty burgers,  and a nice loyalty program.
I had the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheddar.   Haystack Onions set it apart.<//Review>< pics>

<review>There's Burgers and there's oily, but this place has both. These oily burgers are delicious, everything I tasted here is sooo good however it will leave a oily sheen on your hands that won't quit. I recommend the smash fries, Oreo shack and any burger they offer.< /review>< Pics>

Pretty filling burgers. Also good quality for a fast food chain. It's a little more expensive, unless you go during special times where they have a deal, or order one if their deal burgers, which have good options!</text>

<Review>This was my second visit to this location. Both were bad experiences. After waiting for 25 minutes, I never actually got my burger. They put all of their focus on DoorDash orders at the sacrifice of all sit-down customers (about 10 people). You place an order at the counter and then sit at a table with your order number. 5 out of the 10 people waiting at tables had their order "lost".

This place wants to have a gimmick and be something like Five Guys but it can't even compete with a quality burger from Jack-In-The-Box.

Both times, my order was taken by a careless staff member. I was never explained what the "smash" process was and was not asked for a temp on my meat. (For my first visit) what I got was an expensive and very mediocre greasy thin burger on what seems like a store bought bun. Not worth it.

Atmosphere is a step up from fast food environment. Save your money for a Five Guys Burger or Jack-In-The-Box. Both deliver better products and experience.< /Review>< Rate>

Their sweet potatoes are awesome!

Also their smash sauce gives a great taste to their own burgers.

Patties are fresh</review>

<text>Their sweet potatoes are awesome!

Also their smash sauce gives a great taste to their own burgers.

<text>My first time at Smash Burger. It was delicious. I got the Bay Burger. It had mushrooms, arugula and Swiss cheese with a truffle aioli. It was an unctuous umami bomb. I also got a strawberry milkshake and some crispy brussel sprouts. Very friendly counter service. Would definitely go again and try different things.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Arrived at 12:30 pm. Left 1:10 pm. Ordered a beef avocado club, smash fries, Oreo shake. Eat in. Received shake almost instantly. Waited 15 mins. Drank shake. No burger or fries. Waited 10 more mins. Ask employee to check on order. Employee takes receipt. Says it's coming. Ask to make it a to go bag. Finally receive purchase 10 additional minutes. Total time from order: 40 minutes.

Food was okay. Burger lukewarm smash fries soggy. Both because I had to make it to go because my lunch hour was running out.

Shake was good though.

2/5 will not return willingly. Only go there if you have plenty of time. Hour+.< /Review>

<text>The manager here needs to be let go. He was yelling and disrespectful to the lady who seemed new. When she rang me up she was so nice and I feel bad for her. I definitely won’t be coming here again. He was yelling over ketchup refill’s. This guy makes everyone’s life miserable here and it absolutely ruined my day. Please do not come eat here and bare witness to this guy’s savage behavior. I never leave a review, but I had to with my friend in hopes this establishment will just get rid of this disgruntled man.<//text><user>114352337074511904925</user>< Rating>

<Review>You might say burgers are burgers, but I liked the taste, presentation, the garnish (arugula included). The signature smash fries were tasty, the staff were most attentive and there is ample bike parking just outside. They have a loyalty club and internet specials, too.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Edit: Came back a couple months later and the place really turned around, much much better now. Seems like new mgmt or staff or both.

My food was good,  the service and staff left something to be desired...  After waiting in line I approached the blank faced cashier whom didn't even aknowledge my existence until I greeted her myself. I just expected more,  I had a better experience at the San Juan Capistrano location...<//text>< user_id>

Food was ok and so was the service. Burgers are a little small. What was really off putting is the manager barking orders loudly and demeaning his employees on how to fill ketchup? Seriously. The manager was way too loud and outright wrong talking down the way he did to another employee in front of customers to boot. For that i will not return and wish the employees there a better opportunity than this blow hard.< /Text>

The manager is rude as f***and their food is not that tasty it reminded me of a little bit better than McDonald's that's bad it supposed to beWay better than McDonald's I ordered a chicken crispy sandwich and smash fries and it tasted like a McChicken with cheese and some oily as fries with some some type of weird a season they really should be called burgers smash Tom is a rude and I was scared he was going to spit in my food worst dinner I ever had April 28th at 6:50 p.m.<//Review>

A similar experience to Shake Shack at a similar price. A nice egg bun compliments a delicious beef patty with gooey cheese and a special sauce (Smashburger). Smashfries were good but nothing exceptional (very thin cut with garlic and rosemary). I would definitely return for the burger, despite the small size (even for a large) and pricy mark-up.<//review>

While burgers are definitely their thing, they have decent salads as well. For a healthier alternative, try the garden salad.<//Review>

Ordering felt awkward. The guy taking orders was questioning every item ordered. Then suggested to change name to Anna instead of Annabel to make it easier to say 😕
Then, They forgot to put French fries in the bag, the guy said "I believe you, but I have to check your bag."

Burger patty was warm, but buns were cold.
Paid $7 for a burger sized like a mc double.
Menu was dirty and had buggers.
Bathrooms require code, and staff is neglectful of giving you the code.

AVOID THIS PLACE!<//review>< pics>

"Smashburger?" More like "Greaseburger." The taste is there, but super greasy. Do not get the smash fries, even more greasier. 😬<//review>

<Text>I came here for an event a few weeks back, and basically got to try, well, every single one of the items on their menu, so I'm not going to go and rate each individual one. But, overall, everything they have to offer is pretty solid, from their various burgers, to their sides, to their shakes (which are made with Haagen Daz ice cream!). Fantastic, they are not, but solid, they are, falling somewhere in between the fast food world and the fancy burger world, in the same tier as, say, Super Duper.

Some interesting tidbits: they're named what they are because they take fresh meat (ground beef, chicken, etc) and smash it into a super hot griddle, which simultaneously sears, steams, and quickly cooks the meat. Also, while they have set items on their menus, their burgers are actually customizable, for those who like playing with their food. And with the variety of buns, proteins, and ingredients to pick from, there's plenty of combinations to come up with!

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - Spacious venue, with a combination of inaccessible counter height tables, and lower standard height tables and booths.

Bathroom - Didn't check them out, but I imagine they're okay.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>About a medium grade burger place, but still fast food-y in the quality and experience. It will do if you're in the area, but I don't think I would travel to it for their burgers when there are substantial competitors available</text><GmapID>0x808f7e2fcae1b335:0xe188bf359e46ad52< /GmapID><UserId.>104738197320543599782</UserId.>< rating>

About the same as every other Smashburger I've ever been to, average to below average food, disinterested staff, and way overpriced menu.  Only went to this establishment as a lack of options.  Burger if you must, but they'll never compete with In-N-Out unless they make some drastic changes.</text>

<Date>1400862679160<//Date><Rating>2</Rating><Review>The food isn’t worth the service you’ll have to put up with. I feel bad for the employees here and was put-off by management’s behavior. For example, I was halfway through my lunch order here when Manager “Gary” interrupted my checker to chastise him about another order he put in wrong—this resulted in errors in my order as well. No wonder the poor guy messed up.

At the same time another checker took my friend’s order and mistakenly charged him for extra avocado on a dish where it comes standard (the Avocado Black Bean Burger). When my friend pointed out the extra charge, manager Gary again, was rude. He argued with my friend instead and clearly did not know his own menu or offer to fix the problem.
I am a firm believer in the three strikes you're out rule and Gary chewed through at least two of his strikes on this day, and he’s nibbling on a third for not knowing the menu as a manager.<//Review>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) We went to an outlet because all our suitcases had been stolen from the car and we ate at this restaurant by chance because it was next door. We did not expect to find such a special place, not only for the delicious food and one of the best hamburgers in SF, but for the humanity and generosity of Tom, the owner. I recommend it 100%.

(Original)
Fuimos a un outlet porque nos habían robado todas las maletas del coche y comimos en este restaurante de casualidad porque estaba al lado. No nos esperábamos encontrar un sitio tan especial, no sólo por la riquisima comida y una de las mejores hamburguesas de SF, sino por la humanidad y generosidad de Tom, el dueño. Lo recomiendo 100%.</review>
