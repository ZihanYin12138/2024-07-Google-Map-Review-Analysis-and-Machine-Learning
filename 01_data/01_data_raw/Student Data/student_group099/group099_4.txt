<text>Overcharged $40 on the Cabin air filter. Fine on everything else. Check my invoice below.

$69.99 for a Cabin air filter replacement. I just called Big O in Pleasanton, they charge $29.99 for parts and labor. Here at Speedee they hide the “parts” cost by setting it to $69 and set labor to $0, but they show parts and labor for every other service they offered me (see invoice). Good luck finding a $69 air filter online. I asked multiple people at Speedee and their response was candid, “the dealership will charge more”. I probed further and got some sympathy. “That’s what they charge, sorry”. How can you trust someone that charges you $70 for something that costs $12 and takes 30 seconds to do yourself? I was charged $57 for labor on the air filter. An oil change is rightly $85 ($75 after discount). But an air filter change being the same cost??

To be fair, they called me and asked me if I wanted to pay the $70 for the filter. I said yes. That’s my bad. Then I looked it up. Just replace it yourself - I wish I had.

Their smog check is $10 cheaper than another place I checked in Pleasanton, so perhaps their other costs make up for it. Who knows.

Their service otherwise was Speedee, and cordial. Staff called me multiple times to give me updates. In and out in 2 hours with multiple services/fluids.

Can’t blame the staff, just the management.<//text>< Pics>

Good work they're straightforward and going to tell you the truth they're not like a lot of the other places just trying to upsell you they'll tell you if something needs to be done and if something doesn't straight shooters in a world full of bad oil changes and scam car services they are the best< /review>

The brakes blew out on my car one day and it was not driveable. I work more than full time, and needed to get my car working again ASAP. I called and the very nice staff said that I could drop it off after hours and they would get to it the next day. I got a call in the morning, and my car was fixed and picked up that day.

<text>Nice family vibe but very very overpriced for simple work. Got a diagnostic for a battery not holding charge and they came back with it needing a new starter. Part costs 50$ and takes 15 minutes to replace but they wanted to charge me $550 for labor, parts and the diagnostic 💀 noooo way!!! Paid for the diagnostic and it ended up being $165 alone!
I won't be coming back.
Do you research before getting work done here, chances are you can do it yourself or take it elsewhere for much cheaper.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Nice family vibe but very very overpriced for simple work. Got a diagnostic for a battery not holding charge and they came back with it needing a new starter. Part costs 50$ and takes 15 minutes to replace but they wanted to charge me $550 for labor, parts and the diagnostic 💀 noooo way!!! Paid for the diagnostic and it ended up being $165 alone!
I won't be coming back.
Do you research before getting work done here, chances are you can do it yourself or take it elsewhere for much cheaper.</review>

My experience was great! My car was making strange noises the partial day. I brought it in for an oil change where they were able to get in at 12pm without a wait. it literally took 10 minutes with a fill inspection. I also was able to utilize a $10 off coupon.</text>

<Review>I only trust SpeeDee for all of my car repair and ongoing maintenance needs. These guys are expert technicians, and their work is guaranteed. They are honest, fair, and respectful. Additionally the lobby area is welcoming, cozy, and family friendly, and this is important to me because I often have one or two little ones with me, so having a place for them to be kids is helpful. I can't say enough about how great this place is and how much I appreciate the high-quality work and professional service.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1501014182253, 'text': 'Hi Jason,\nThanks so much for the great review!

Horrible customer service! Avoid coming to location. I've been going to Speedee Oil Change for over 7years in different cities so when coming to the Pleasanton store I anticipated the same service. I came to this location now 3xs. Each time they explained that my radiator hose was broken and would need to he replaced. They have replaced and charged me 3xs for a radiator hose. How is this possible or legit for a company that specializes in this? They then get upset when you ask them why is this happening when honestly the company is baiting you for more money. Dont walk away, run! They should not be in business if they cant effectively communicate or do their job! I spoke with the manager Reggie who is eating while working on your car (says a lot) who couldnt provide details to the situation and is defensive when asked a question. If you ready prior reviews of this shop and horrible service they are all true l!< /review>

Took my vehicle in this morning for an oil change. They told me I needed my radiator drained, flushed and refilled. My radiator had previously been drained and refilled, but not by them. Then they told me I needed to change my transmission oil ($80+). I had just come back from a nearby transmission shop that gave me a complete transmission oil change! They said it was based on miles and that was their policy. They don't check - they just try to up sell to the unsuspecting motorist. Don't trust them - I won't use them again.< /text>

So here's the deal.  Reggie, the guy who runs this shop, takes cars to a different shop to be worked on...in Milpitas!  His parents own a shop there and he uses his shop to get them business.  He says things like, "My AC guys is only here on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I'm gonna need to keep the car for a few days."  Because he's driving it back and forth to Milpitas!  I'm pretty sure this is NOT legal and my lawyer and I will be sorting this out.  That's not the only thing he has said he could fix that was outside the parameters of an oil change place...  I wonder if the owner knows he's using his place to feed his parents business.  Further, Reggie said he would give me my money back for charging my AC because it didn't take.  Because it had a leak, and they should have determined that before they sent me away "good to go."  THEN, after they made me fix my radiator for $500 so they could test the AC system to find the problem AND replaced another part for $200+ that they thought erroneously was the problem, they refused to give me my money back for the charge that never held because they never fixed the actual leak/problem!  So, now I'm suing for ALL the money back.  They should've just been reasonable... stupid.< /text>

<text>Horrible Service here.  Took my brand new car here for its first oil change only to have them spill oil all down the side of the engine which smoked and smelled for a few days.

Next they set all of my tires to different PSI's which drove my internal warnings crazy and I had to take it to a gas station to set them correctly.

Finally they couldn't figure out how to reset the oil change light so they reset all of the trip computers that I was trying to monitor for fuel and mileage purposes for work.

This was the first and last time I'll go here, looks like I'll deal with the horrible Customer Service at Wal-Mart instead.  Atleast they don't spill or reset anything.

I'm just dissapointed I couldn't give them 0 stars, 1 is the minimum.< /text>< Pictures>

This is without a doubt the best place to get locked up. Good food, New facilities,  Air Conditioned to a constant 68° June is Not recommended as it's the last month of the fiscal year and inventory for the Commissary so everything is basically out of stock...< /review>

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. I said our pledge every morning when I was in school. I remember a police officer telling us how important that pledge truly is. I have family who serve and protect, two of my dearest friends whom I love dearly serve and protect. Stanislaus County Sheriff Department has not upheld the law. I saw the video of a red jeep almost hit a woman, regardless of what a group is doing or what there cause is for you can't attempt to hit someone with a vehicle. That same red jeep took off excessively throwing dust into a man named Steve Hindi. Steve is the President of an animal rights group called SHARK. Again, there is law, and I don't care about the dairy farm( happy cows ) and I don't care about SHARK, I care about the law being enforced. Sheriff you and your officers did not enforce the law. It's unfortunate that it doesn't give the option to put a negative review because YOU and your officers showed exactly what your review should be.< /Review>

Very unprofessional, The cells are disgusting and filthy, they also abuse people that are going through booking processes as well as inmates. I was booked for reckless driving and was treated very inhumane by their officers. They abuse their authority and go on power trips while they believe they are justified just because they wear a uniform. Honestly this is a cringeworthy excuse of a facility of justice.< /Text>

80 million dollar a year budget, can't curb the drug trade going on right under their nose. Maybe they should spend less on toys and more on quality and less on quantity. I could run the Sheriff Department with half the budget and accomplish ten times more. There is no thin blue line. All that matters is their bloated retirements and the law not applying to their corruption.< /review>

I am a follower of SHARK.  Your job is to keep the peace.  You are not private security guards.  SHARK organizers have a constitutional right to video what is going on there as long as they are on public land.  It is irrelevant whether you agree or like what they are doing.  Honor your oath!<//text>

I went there to file a report for somebody stealing a package off of my house. They told me I needed to go online and file a report. I think it's sad that we pay our employees to take care of criminal things and then they tell you to go online .  I didn't like it a bit.<//Review>

What you have done to the county is horrible.  I remember looking up to police when I was a kid, thinking of all the cool bad guys they catch.  Not anymore. A ounce great position of respect has been sold out to the highest bidder.   I feel bad for the few none corrupt cops that jobs and being diminished by the others.   Mark this department corrupt.< /Text>

Sheriff Christianson is your average, run-of-the-mill, corrupt, lying cop that thinks he is above the law, and he uses his badge to bully and harass people and scare them into complying with his unlawful will.  You know who also used scare tactics like that?  Hitler.  It's time for a purge in this country of BAD cops and career politicians.  Stop targeting all cops as bad, because they aren't, but cops like Christianson that have video evidence and MULTIPLE complaints against him and his department, that use tax money to commit fraud and felonies, then refuse to provide public information because it would incriminate them, need to be systematically found and "purged" from society.  Not fired, not just "under investigation", not put on leave, but charged, arrested, held without bond, and tried in FEDERAL court, but only with CIVILIAN jurors.  Stay out of this corrupt county and save yourself from being harassed by thugs with badges...it might save your life!<//text>

They aren't there to protect and serve the people of the county either, it's all about the money for them. It all starts at the top with Sheriff Christianson.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>I feel sorry for the citizens of Stanislaus county because of how the Sheriff will put big dairy farmers and business first and not up holding the law,i have clearly seen how Stanislaus counties Sheriff orders his deputies not to up hold the law when a member of public was bullied and nearly knocked over,then the driver spun his back wheels so that dirt was thrown up into his face by a jeep type of car,when said person went to a Stanislaus Sheriffs deputy he was ignored which i find disgraceful behavior,so much so that i will tell my family and friends to stay well clear of this county and don't go there,because if you need help from LEO's you could well be ignored if any of the dairy farmers and big business people are involved,shame really as we are planing a holiday in the USA but Stanislaus County is crossed of said list of places to go,would rather spend our money in a county were LEO's treat everyone as equals.< /Text><name>startazz</name><Time>1471385105236</Time><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

Most of the cops there need to be fired, especially Sheriff Christianson who is a true criminal! Stanislaus County Sheriff Department should be ashamed of themselves!

{'time': 1608582797524, 'text': 'Hello Connor,\nSurf Thru would like to apologize for your experiences that you have had. Was this issue ever reported to a manager or supervisor on site? We always acknowledge concerns brought to our attention about the satisfaction of our wash process. Our Chico location washes hundreds of vehicles daily company wide and we do not have any claims about our wash taking off clear coats. We also have many happy customers that take pride in their vehicles and that is why they continue to wash their vehicle at Surf Thru without issue. Our brushes and wraps are designed specifically to not scratch or damage our customers vehicles. It sounds like the clear coat has oxidized and is breaking down, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about that as we did not cause the oxidization to occur on your vehicle.\nThank You,\nOwnership  \u200b'}<//response>

This is an okay wash. It's not expensive, they have free vacuums, and they have a vending machine which has detailing stuff for decent prices. The wash doesn't always get everything off  of your car but it's worth it if want to keep your car pretty clean and get it done quickly. My only complaint with this place is that the wash has torn clear coat off my car. And not small amounts either. I just got this car, I did a very thorough check of the cars condition before I bought it. This damage wasn't present before I started taking it here, and it gets worse every time I go. Granted, it's a six year old car but as I said this damage wasn't present before I started taking it here. Now I have to conjure up the money to get it fixed before it gets even worse, it'd be awesome if the owners would fix the damage, if they do I'll add that to my review. My advice to anyone reading this is to only use this wash when you need a quick wash, and hand wash your car more often than you take it here. If you don't care about your cars condition, take it here as much as you'd like. But I wouldn't recommend taking your car here more than once every two weeks. Hand washing is best!</text>

< review>
This place is great don't let the bad reviews from others distract you from the fact that this Surf Thru Express, doesn't get as packed as the other one in town. It's a no brainer that you obviously don't want to bring a new car here haha. Like the workers in the front actually scrub down your car before you enter the machine. They make sure to walk with your car as it start to enter and even scrub the back as you enter. The place is very clean and well maintained, sometimes they walk through the vacuum section and if they notice your car didn't get well scrubbed they'll ask you to go ahead and go around for another wash for free! It happened to me 2 times since I've been coming here. In conclusion don't believe the bad reviews that complain this place is great and doesn't get as busy. I highly recommend you try it out for your own thoughts.</review>

I have had my unlimited pass for $29.99 on and off since September 2020. I loved the idea that I can go through the car wash any time I wanted. Its such a great idea. I love that they offer the vacuums and spray hoses to clean up your car after its washed up.
So...I will say I am giving them 2 stars because lately when I go through the car wash, half of my car is still extremely dirty. The car wash will only scrub half my car and completely misses the entire back. I end up having to go back through the wash cycle twice and still having the same results.  It wasn't like this before but for some reason the last 6 times I've went I've had issues. I've tried both locations here in Chico. Both have left my car dirty after the first wash.
The staff are always friendly and I do love that.< /text>

<review>The better of the two Surf Thru's in Chico, leaves your car cleaner, lines tend to be shorter, and the vaccuums are stronger than the one on Forest. Though the wash won't always take everything off your car or may miss a few spots on it.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>I recently went through this car wash for a cleaning and when I came out, not only was my car still dirty but I also had noticed that there were scratches all over my windows. I just bought this car in December. I filed a claim and they denied it because "theres never really a problem with other cars". But reading through some of these reviews, there's obviously been a few that got scratches on their exteriors also. Smh it literally looked like someone went ice skating on my windows.

I've been through other car washes before and never had this problem. Definitely not going to them again.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1613597999156, 'text': 'Hello Rei,\nSurf Thru Express Car Wash take all claims very seriously.  Surf Thru resolves any issues caused by employee negligence or equipment malfunction. All of the material in the car wash that makes contact with vehicles is made of soft foam and specifically designed not to scratch vehicles. Therefore, if there was anything malfunctioning in the car wash at the time of your vehicle, it would have occurred to vehicles in front of you and behind you. That did not occur here. As a matter of fact, hundreds of cars were washed before you and after you with no claims of damage of any kind. Cameras also revealed that everything in the wash functioned normally. You also claim that there were scratches on most of your windows, passenger side, driver’s side and rear windows. It is literally impossible for that to occur in the wash, because different foam wraps touch different sides of your vehicle. There is no possible way, for example, something could be caught in one set of wraps and then cause scratches on parts of your vehicle that it did not even touch. We are sorry you believe the car wash caused damage to your vehicle, however, the evidence is that it simply did not occur at the car wash.'}< /resp>

<review>I took my Tacoma in and got the "best car wash". Truck was still dirty.  Went around and got is washed a second time, still dirty.  Now I am going to have to hand wash it, like I should have done in the first place.  Staff was nice, but this place does not get your car clean.

This car wash ripped off my valve stem causing me to almost wreck on the freeway four minutes after leaving the car wash and shredding my tire.  I called them to place a claim and they said their car wash doesn't do that.  Lolz.  They denied my claim.  I have my calls to aaa and a photograph of the damage.  They are like, we watched a video of you leaving and like, it looked like things were fine.  So.  I would say, if you want to use this carwash, hope they don't damage your car...because they don't stand behind their service. Another thing.  Their washes aren't great.  They are cheap. If you don't have problems with them, you will be fine. Im grateful I can afford to replace things like valve stems and tires. As I can afford a better car wash.< /Review>

<text>When I had an issue with the monthly payments, they were very fair and corrected the problem.  I also made some suggestions about the speed of the line and they said that my suggestion would be passed on.  The staff is really nice and hardworking.  The unlimited vacuum and air guns are a great benefit.</text>< Time>

< Review>
My car front headlight and also the license plate got damaged, scratched and bent every time I went through the car wash in both locations in Chico.
The manager declined the claim due to the fact that just water and foam.  When I questioned him how could the water and foam damaged the license bending every time I went through? He just hanged up and did not admit their mistake!
It is so unprofessional. Definitely not a good place to get your car washed if you want to protect your car, without any damage.< /Review>

<Text>My wife and I have been members of the car wash monthly shared card for about a year and a half.  if you like to keep your car looking pretty good on the outside and vacuum once in awhile this is immensely convenient and a good value.  Our kids love going through the wash ( in the car of course) ;)

Vacuums are convenient and staff is always consistently good.  Never had a problem with vacuums, wash or anything else and we have a 4Runner and Genesis sedan.  Cleans both vehicles pretty well though you may need to do a little extra work on the side mirrors.< /Text><rate>5</rate></record>

Just went through this morning around 7:30am the host was very friendly got a free cup of coffee. Then the manage (can’t remember his name) was very great. He did a more thorough wash then the usual two people do together before my truck was sent through the machine wash! Very happy and pleased with the service I got this morning better than any other time I’ve been there!< /Text>

Best car wash I've used, especially for the price. I share a monthly package deal with my husband and we have found it valuable. We always go through the drive-thru wash, then utilize the air blower and vacuum for the interior. There are plenty of separate trash and recycling bins available for all the junk in your car, which I appreciate. The actual wash does a pretty great job and the employees have all been friendly. Conveniently located on Esplanade.< /text>

<text>Great car wash (unless you skip washing for a few weeks and your car gets covered in bird sh$&, then it'll take two or three passes) friendly staff, clean, free vacuums, prices are fair. (Not cheap but not expensive).

Lost a star because of the time I had to run it through three times to get it clean.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>There is no organization with there computer systems I paid for the extreme surf package an got service for the cheap Express package because there is no organization they have you pay and go but the machine does not register which car paid for what so someone else got what I paid for and with no manager to talk to so I dont recommend this place to anyone unless you like paying for others</review>< pics>

<Review>I have had mixed results and experiences with the Surf Thru car wash (both locations), but mostly good.  Today I stopped in for an Ultimate wash without tire shine.  The cashier was friendly and set me up.  When I pulled up to the wash the guys were putting forth an effort but seemed more interested in whatever they were talking about.  Not unusual.  I got through the wash and had a lunch appointment to get to.

Later I realized I hadn't received my $5 off coupon.  This wasn't a big deal but I was driving by later so I stopped in to see if they still offered this. After talking to one of the employees he let me know the manager would be out to help me.

As the "manager" came up she was looking the truck over and asked if this was the same vehicle that I had washed earlier...  I said yes and she basically told me that I was lying because the tire shine wasn't on and the under carriage was still dirty.  I was surprised and offended. Not to mention this highlights the poor quality of the wash.  I showed her the receipt and didn't have much else to say as I was taken back by her attitude.

She gave me the $5 dollar coupon, made some smart comment, and walked off.

I don't expect a professional detail when I go there, nor a high level of customer service, but this was far from acceptable.<//Review>< Pics>

Went through the wash twice and it still didn't clean my car, the brushes weren't working in the left side and didn't bother to tell anyone!</text>

It got my car pretty clean, but left scratches along one spot on my car (perfectly repeated circular scratches from one of the brushes inside). I sold that car since, but I wasn't happy to have those scratches in the paint job. I'll never go back with any car that's mini-suv size or bigger. My husband has never had an issue with his sedan though.</text>

<Text>This place was Awesome! There was a friendly attendant there to help check me in and decide what type of wash I wanted. The wash was really really good. My car has always had a problem getting truly clean. This car wash did a phenomenal job. The vacumes were included in the cost of the car wash! So it wad pick up and go with those. There was a vending machiene with smell good stuff and dashboard wipes and stuff too. I will be back! Thank you everyone at surf thru express car wash!<//Text>< time>

<Text>I went to the new location on esplanade and I was trying it out due to it being close to my house. I have a BRAND NEW 2019 car that was less than a week old when I went to this location. Their NEW employees scrubbed my car with their brushes extremely hard and scratched the window to my car. They then did a damage report and tried to tell me the damage was pre-existing on a BRAND NEW CAR. They have absurdly unprofessional customer service. I told them that I hate to be a person who complains but the fact that they argued there was pre-existing damage to a new car is outrageous. The employee even APOLOGIZED For the damage and offered to wait with me until a manager came out. They claimed they have had less that 1,000 car washes at this new location which further PROVES that this location is inexperienced leading to more room for mistakes and DAMAGES. Thanks to them, my less than a week old car already has damage! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! I also talked to individuals from the forest ave location so if you care about your car, I would not wash my car from this company. My review is not a rant but a detailed experience from someone who wishes there was no problems to begin with. It’s unfortunate that they handled this situation poorly. *******EDIT BASED OFF OWNERS REPLIES TO MY REVIEWS AND NOT TO ME PERSONALLY*******  And please do not try to save face now. I have messaged this company privately and they left me on read AND asked for an explanation on the phone when they called about the damage report and no one gave me information. It took me posting on social media for them to respond to any of my claims. Now they are responding to all my reviews in order to seem like they care when I was not getting any responses originally. This makes you look EVEN WORSE as a company. *potential customers: beware of companies who only try to save themselves while FULLY NEGLECTING their customers*</Text>< Pictures>

<Time>1622081055138<//Time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>I just went there had to go though 2 times. I even told them what I wanted, and I still had to go home and clean my car. My back window was still spotty and didn’t even look like it got washed, spots and bugs still on the front window shield. Not worth the $18!< /review>< pics>

<response>{'time': 1622221946492, 'text': 'Hello Heather,\nSurf Thru would like to apologize for your recent experience at our Chico location. We have good success cleaning most vehicles the first time through. Rewashes are not often needed, but with the transition in weather and the bugs, not everything may come off the first time.\nThe site manager is now aware of this review and will inspect all equipment to ensure everything is working properly. We appreciate the feedback.\nSincerely,\nOwnership'}< /response><GmapID>0x8082d953b3c178dd:0x592933952a32e06b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I loved it because this is where my fiance stopped in at today to grab a bite to eat while he took our new Honda in for its first service. He said nice patio dining and nice inside too.

Decided to give Jimmy E's a try after seeing their new marketing. Most definitely worth it. They have variety in their menu and all of it is pretty good. Was a fan of the pizza and the gyros/pitas. They have gained a new customer. Also I ordered their salad thinking it was a small one nope ginormous and worth it.<//Text>

Very good ambience, and food was good too. Best thing we had was a Philly cheese steak! We heard they have the smoker going on during the weekend, so it may be a good idea to go there again then!< /Text>

We sat in outside patio. Was nice. Drinks were ok. We came specifically for the dog menu as we wanted to bring our dog along for dinner. They loved their food.< /text>

<review>Wonderful place to grab a beer and a bite during this pandemic. Food is reasonably priced and they have an amazing happy hour that occurs EVERYDAY. Even Fridays and Saturdays. All of the workers are very friendly, and the general manager George often checks in with all of the customers to ensure their experience is going well. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a safe pandemic dining experience. Cheers!</review><user>112708887866690997161< /user>< name>

I love how they remodeled the place. Was Delius restaurant.  Great place to watch games or just hang out with your friends. Had my first ever plant based burger with thick cut smoked apple bacon! And I was so surprised, it was good.  They have themed drink nights and the staff are so personable. Check them out.< /review>

<text>Best burger.  Stopped by to pick up a decent burger, and was happy to see all of the choices for sides— too many to list here, but I chose tater tots.  It was the best burger I’ve had in years, and the tater tots were perfectly crispy on the outside!  Thanks Jimmy Es.  I’ll be back for more!</text>< pics>

It has something for everyone whether you're looking to have some drinks and unwind with your friends or enjoy a delicious meal with the family. You can even bring your fur babies because they have an awesome patio equipped with leash hooks, dog bowls, and a dog menu. There's 20 beer taps that provide a great variety of cold refreshing beers and a full bar with great hand crafted cocktails. Overall, the atmosphere, food and beverages are amazing.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSFls8MN91ESlhxYI5QRokDD8kD3tFwTYtu9Oq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Nick was my server and even tho the food took longer than usual, Nick took care of me and made sure I was happy. And even tho the food took long it was amazing and worth the wait.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqyaAll8wz5PHQZNHem843oWHToMTxVZwG2z-7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnVGVQNyTNDuRlhnKk-tMzFK3xFJcNU-Y__r70=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<Text>It's a great spot with tons of potential. Food is still a little slow to come out and they are working on that issue. It's quite delicious when it does come out. Bartenders are friendly and a few need to know their beers on tap a little better. I wish there were more seats at the bar and the bar was a little bigger. I love the family style tables where you can have lots of people sit together comfortably. They just opened and are working out some of the bugs and it's definitely worth a try!</Text>< pics>

The food . The service . The vibe ... Dog-friendly outdoor patio ... Big Screen Televisions line the walls . The bar is well stocked by several local breweries as well as national national known beers on tap with ample seating .

A well thought out menu executed beautifully . Generous portions with  excellent flavors . Nothing pretentious . Just good food done right . Family-friendly . Excellent service ...

Definitely coming back !< /text>

<Text>Pleasantly surprised. Happy to have a place close by. We were sat right away and server came right to our table.

Drinks came quick...we ordered food and it all came quick.

Chicken wings were very good. Not fried hard but I like it that way. Chicken sandwich had lots of chicken and fries were great. I had penne bolognese. Nice portion but lacked flavor even with the meat and veggies. Came with garlic bread.

Had the cookie for dessert.

Overall a great visit. Living g 1 mile away we will be back for sure.

Happy hour menu is pretty good.</Text>< pics>

Want a place to watch sports? This is your place. Craving a burger and a beer? There are some decent offerings but nothing that sets this place apart from others. They had a okay happy hour menu with wine, beer and fried food. Ordered nachos, and was a bit disappointed as the cheese appeared to be a mix of nacho cheese and real cheese.< /review>

I have been on a big Cesar salad kick the past few weeks and this is in the running for one of the best. The service was great and has been everytime I have come in. Today Jacob assisted me and he was knowledgeable and always made sure I was taken care of. I work across the street so it was nice to tap into the wifi and work and enjoy a good meal. I do look forward to coming back after work and trying some beers, they have a good selection and a ton of TVs.  Oh ya, try the tater tots with a side of barbeque sauce to balance the salad :)<//text>< Date>

<Review>First time there...service was extremely professional and courteous.  Sat at the bar and had a very nice hoppy IPA (Jimmy E IPA).  Very disappointed in the fish and chips..it was just okay.  FF were decent.  Saw the cobb salad (hugh and just good looking) and will attempt that on a return visit.  It's nice to have an upscale sports bar in Signal Hill.</Review>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><review>The overall experience was great. The people at Michael Flooring knew their stuff and actually recommend a less expensive carpet for us then what we initially were interested in and explained how it would be a better fit for our home.
They are busy so there were a few times where we had to wait a few days for a response from them which was somewhat frustrating. But we felt they took good care of us.<//review>< Pictures>

I am so happy to share that Michael Flooring was absolutely fantastic in getting carpets replaced for my place. I was able to get a lot done over the phone and Nic was so attentive to what I needed and my time frame. He made sure everything was taken care of and made the whole experience as smooth as possible. The installers were professional and thorough. I will be going back to these guys should I have any other flooring needs in the future.<//Text>

Great experience all around!  Mason was a pleasure to work with and he kept us informed the entire process.  We are super pleased with our carpet purchase and finished product.  Michaels Flooring should be your first stop when considering any new flooring.  Reasonably priced and professional service.  Thanks guys!< /text>

<text>I am very much impressed with the work that Michael Flooring did in our house with the installation of a brand new hardwood flooring. This flooring company has done the job very professionally and has great people who provides assistance in all aspects of flooring. The flooring installers were terrific. The guys came in, moved the furnitures with utmost care, room to room, and installed the new floor quickly and efficiently. Once they finished with the flooring, they moved all the furnitures back in place. They were responsive, capable, and really great to work with.<//text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We started our full house floor replacement with Michael Flooring and that’s where we ended up.  Their quote was reasonable and all inclusive, which was not our experience with some others in town.  We went to two other well known places plus the big box stores. We got quotes from all of them plus private installers (in case we bought the material separate from the install).  In the end, we chose Michael Flooring.  Mason is very knowledgeable and helpful.  When our carpet choice was going to be delayed, Mason contacted us immediately and offered several options.  He knew our price point and color preference, and offered quite a few options, with the info on how each option would effect our original quote.
* with a remodel project as big as this, our whole house, it was comforting and reassuring to deal with someone who was upfront and had ALL the info we needed.
The installer that they had for us was TOP NOTCH!!! Jamie was professional, on time, kept everything cleaned up, and ahead of schedule.
We had vinyl plank laid in all common areas of our home, including linen closet and a walk-in storage room.  We had carpet laid in the bedrooms and their closets.
Thank you Mason, Jamie, and Michael Flooring!!! We love it !< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Great work! Great price! The workers did an awesome job and very fast!! I got estimates from multiple places and Michael’s was the most affordable.

By far the best experience I have had while doing some remodeling on my house. I replaced all my flooring with LVP. From the moment I stepped in the store, right through to giving them my final check, the customer service was amazing. I took home two large sample floorings and then they drove out to measure and give me an estimate. Very professional and friendly. Mason was the best to work with,  and alway made sure everything was going as planned. They contracted Cesar to lay my floor. I cannot say enough positive things about Cesar. He is a true craftsman at what he does and very professional. He was at my house every morning by 7 am and worked hard the entire time. I would highly recommend Michael's flooring to anyone.<//Text>

We had Michael Flooring redo our kitchen counter tops and backsplash. We have a couple spots in the backsplash that didn’t end up flush with others, fortunately we were able to hide those little flaws. We were told that it would only take about a week from start to finish, but it took two. Over all, very professional, courteous, and the the crew they have put together, amazing!! I’ll be returning for them to redo my baths next! Thank you Mason, glad we had you on our team!</Text>

<Review>We recently contracted with Michael Flooring, Inc., to install Luxury Vinyl Flooring throughout 3 areas of our house and carpet in one bedroom.  They provided excellent service from the initial contact through installation.  They explained their products, offered great alternatives, gave a written and  thorough estimate, were flexible and helpful with the installation date (near the holidays), installed beautifully and cleaned well.  In short, they did what they promised for what we agreed upon and that is a rare commodity in today’s world.  Thank you to Ysenia and the rest of the team at Michael’s Flooring, Inc.!</Review><Rate>5<//Rate><user_id>106846465241150872837< /user_id>< pictures>

We came to Michael Flooring for a second opinion after being lied to over a sale from another local competitor.  Luis was honest with us from the get go and was able to offer us the same product for a much cheaper amount.  It was obvious who was running the honest business and who was not.  We appreciate the honesty at Michael Flooring and quick installation of our floors.<//Text>

< review>
We purchased vinyl plank flooring for our whole home except for a bathroom and a closet from Michael Flooring. We also chose to have them install the flooring. Initially, during the sales process, Mason, our sales guy, was very helpful, friendly, etc. we actually selected this company out of the several others because of the selection and customer service. HUGE mistake. The problems began during the installation process and hasn’t ended yet.

We has numerous issues during the installation process. First, the wrong flooring was installed in our laundry room that we didn’t see until it has already been installed. Second, the installers permanently damaged the lid to our toilet when they removed it to install the bathroom floors. They never mentioned it or apologized for it. We initially thought it was just dirty, but after cleaning it, realized the paint was scraped off. Another issue was the product that was to be installed around the base of our kitchen cabinets. Mason was extremely confusing during the purchasing process regarding this, but he ultimately promised that a white base shoe/toe kick material would be installed, going as far as guaranteeing it would not be the flooring toe kick that would be installed. Well, the installers installed the flooring toe kick which was not supposed to happen according to Mason but was normal according to the installers. After a harrowing exchange with Mason, we were able to get actual wooden baseboard installed along the outside of the cabinets (which Mason said couldn’t be done initially during the sales process).

Those issues, although annoying, are not the problem. Flash forward 6 months after installation, and now we are dealing with water damage in our kitchen because during the installation process, the installers moved our dishwasher and didn’t pay attention to the fact that the plastic main drain pipe moved underneath the frame causing it to crack and water to leak underneath the floors to the point that water was seeping up through the cracks in puddles. We rarely use the dishwasher (maybe 2-3 times in the past 6 months) which is why we are barely finding it about this issue. After contacting Michael Flooring twice asking to speak the the owner who apparently refuses to speak to us, we had to deal with Mason again. He is so unpleasant to deal with regarding issues. He makes passive aggressive comments, he’s argumentative, and deflective of any responsibility. Of course during the installation process he blamed all the issues on the installers when some of the issues were his communication errors. As usual, as soon as I told Mason about the water damage, he immediately began denying that the dishwasher was touched during the installation process, even though he wasn’t present to supervise and didn’t listen or ask any questions to understand that it had to be moved to demo the tile underneath and install the new floors, which we have evidence that proves this. After reviewing all our evidence of this (including the diagnostics from the dishwasher repairman who told us it was damaged during the installation process) and the fact that if the crack were there prior to the installation process, it would have leaked prior and they would have seen water damage during the installation process which they acknowledged was true, Mason denied that they caused the crack saying it was there prior and refuses to repair the damaged flooring and pad. Interesting he asserts this when a repairman diagnosed otherwise.

So, I know this is a long review, but I would feel horribly if someone else were to experience this after paying thousands of dollars. I was hoping that Michael Flooring would exceed my low expectations and at the very least and just fix the damage to the floor since I already fixed the damage to the dishwasher. Unfortunately, they are only pleasant during the sales process. Knowing what I do now, I would have paid more money to another company to have had a better experience. It’s unfortunate that companies will lie to customers and negate responsibility for a dollar.< /review>

The day we purchase the flooring the sales person Yesenia said we can pick up at any day and I asked again since we went on Saturday and myself and even my husband asked again any day and she said yes. Soooo there goes my husband on Sunday to the warehouse and guess what... it was closed! So than I called to ask why were we given wrong info and she stated with some what of an attitude that she never did. So she accommodated  us with having our purchased floor sent to showroom since warehouse closes at 4pm and there was no my husband could make it because of his work schedule.. which was great I was happy... but than guess what?!?!??!  Yeah they messed up again.... so I called before heading down to showroom to confirm that my order was there for pick up and the receptionist said yes. When I get there waited about 10min until Yesenia told me my order WAS NOT there! And they had to take it to another warehouse so we can pick it up there instead. Wow so at this point I was pretty upset and Yesenia said she would MAIL me a gift card for the inconvenience and I was like fine
I go to the other warehouse and the guy there still asking me (like if I knew why) Why was my order sent over here?? How can I answer that??? Lol so after I finally got my order
But...... its been more than a month and no gift card
I called spoke with Yesenia and she said well if SHOULD of been sent since they had to send another for a different person... so that can only mean either employees are keeping the gift card or they just tell people they will get one to get them out of their hair 🤔... there you have it guys... will I ever go there again... of course not do I recommend the flooring well yes I love the floor I got wish the experience was better</Review>< Pictures>

Michael flooring did my floors and carpets. We were satisfied to have had the opportunity to work with Yesenia Abundis. She was on the spot. Everything that she promised they completed and went beyond. They were also timely, clean, professional, and the installers were also great and respectful. I highly suggest them. Ask for Yesenia for all your flooring needs.<//Text>

<Review>If you want to buy granite from them, you better read this:

I have bought my kitchen granite counter tops from them and i paid for a good quality granite. After installation were done, granites start discoloring due to mild heat and even mild coldness. these granites were very sensitive to heat and cold. they did not disclosed that to me and by the way who wants a heat sensitive granite in the kitchen????he knew i wanted these granites for my kitchen!!!
I have talked to the store owner but he did not want to take the responsibility of that??
the discoloration started the first day i start using this granite. It was a bad experience for me and i think very soon i need to remodel my kitchen again because of their mistake in selecting a good quality granite.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>2< /Rating><GmapID>0x80ea404c771c35f7:0x3fb6e3a04df5aef5</GmapID>< Time>

<Review>I have a problem with my flooring that was purchased from Michaels flooring. I have called multiple times to get someone to contact me regarding this and they are not returning calls. I have talked to the owner twice he has not taken care of this matter. He tells me he will be here in 30 minutes and doesn't show up. When I call back he is always out on appointments.
A very frustrated customer,

After standing around for 20 minutes waiting to be assisted, one employee (who was assisting another customer) just looked at me without so much as telling me he would be right with me. Never got help or was even offered assistance after 20 minutes. Ridiculous. Poor customer service. Will not be returning< /text>

I had my initial visit with Physical Therapy. It was a very positive experience. Everyone was friendly and professional. I was very happy with the one on one experience. My therapist put together a strategy that will help me rehab my injuries. I have hope that I'll make a complete recovery!</text>

<Text>The staff at Healthpointe Ontario are all great. However, the wait to see the doctor is ridiculously long. It shouldn't take 2 hours from check-in to exam room, then you still have to wait for the doctor. 🤔🤔<//Text>< Rating>

<review>DO NOT GO HERE. Have your attorney find a better clinic. They don’t respect your time. My appointments are always at 2:30 pm and I still have to wait an hour and a half it’s ridiculous. Only one time, a fluke,  I waited a half hour. Today I had my 2 granddaughters and gave them a heads up and asked if I was going to have to wait 1 1/2 hrs like last time. Not sure what she babbled about but it’s very unprofessional and I had to walk out as my back was killing me from sitting and standing so long. Never again will I allow a two-bit clinic to waste my time like that again.< /review></record>

Front counter girls are so very helpful and friendly, they will assist you with a smile. And then you have Dianna, she is the greatest, she does the work of three girls, she is always busy, but she will always take the time to say hi how you doing, how do you feel, and she will take time out of her busy day to help you, with a smile. She's great.</review>

Fairly poor especially from doctor mcmurrary. I came in after a fall at work with migraine nausea and vertigo. He diagnosed me as migraine. Saw him for a solid two minutes. It wasn’t until I saw doctor Anthony that realized I had fluid in my ear and possible broken bones. He was good. He immediately set out for me to see an ent. But mcmurray would ask what’s wrong and I’d ask when will I see this ent. He didn’t know what I was talking about even though as this point we’ve been discussing it for two weeks. My final diagnosis by the ent was ear infection eustation tube blockage and hearing loss which caused my concussion like symptoms. Mcmurray put ringing in ear as my diagnosis in my official insurance claim papers. NEVER EVER said that I ringing in my ears. He kept asking how work was even though he sent me back notes saying I couldn’t work. He needs to retire because this is pure medical negligence.< /Text>

<review>I love Healthpointe in Ontario, California! I really wish I would’ve been sent here from the first day of my injury! I have never received better care anywhere else until I came here!
The entire staff is so kind and compassionate. Carlos is such an amazing therapist! Thanks to Carlos, I have seen improvements in my lower back and knee pain! I also want to thank Francine at the desk for always being so kind and accommodating when scheduling my appointments!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c333c3b48582dd:0xddb5b2107fc4d057< /Gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

My wife's appointment was at 11:45 am and we arrived at 11:30 am.  She has bad nerve damage and has trouble sitting because it makes her feet swell.  We waited for almost 2 hours until she was seen, and not one person in the office told us they were behind. Extremely poor communication between staff and patients.  This happens a lot in this Ontario location!  Upper management needs to review why wait times are way out of line!< /Text>

Overall, the staff are friendly.Lots of paperwork to fill out when you are a new patient. For my first time there I didn’t have many complaints except for the feeling of being rushed to clear a room for the next person. I will follow up after my next visit.
Second time around the day appeared to be double booked. I was waiting an hour after my appointment time, but wasn't the only one. The staff is courteous and work to get you what you need. The doctor I was seen by was very helpful and friendly. So far, my experience with this medical office is good.< /review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>This doctors office is pretty good. Text and phone reminders for appointments. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They follow Covid protocol correctly, so you feel safe. Since changing doctors, I have had to wait a little on a few occasions, but she is a great doctor, always answers any questions and doesn’t make you feel rushed.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Dr Culver was an amazing Individual to deal with and the folks that work underneath him were also great.  It did take a long time in the waiting room but I guess that’s the price you pay for quality medical treatment.<//Text>

<text>Healthpointe has always had impeccable service. The reminder phone calls for appointments, ease of scheduling appointments, and the service provided during my office visits have been stellar, five star service. Now that my time with them has come to an end, I would like to recommend their services to potential patients by proving my review. I wish that my PCP offered the same excellent services!</text><Date>1568764658049<//Date>< Rate>

The physicians assistant was very concerned about me. She listened to my explanation of pains, and she addressed them. She had submitted some paperwork to Workers Comp that got rejected, but she saw what they wanted and added it and sent it in and I got my medication and back.</Text>

<Text>The staff is great, but my concern is why does everything from chairs to tables to equipment look so bad? They need to be replaced for the patients..torn or worn out seats in waiting rooms and definitely in the physical therapy area... Safety for the patients is definitely a concern...old stuff support your clinics</Text>< username>

I had a bad experience because the Representative at the call center didn't listen to me when I gave him me e/mail address and thought it was funny that I had been waiting hours for an e/mail for a phone appt to find out later that he didn't listen and had the wrong e/mail from another Representative.</Review>

Terrible!! I waited a month to be scene and when I showed up an hr prior to my appointment, the front desk said it was a scheduling error that Dr Katz was not in that day. Front desk in Ontario location were very nice and helpful but it doesn’t excuse the 2 text messages and the 2 phone calls I received to confirm I was scheduled for that day. I even called 2 days prior to confirm with a man named Oscar. I hope this isn’t the way it’s going to be at healthpointe.< /Review>

You sit in examining room anywhere from 40min to an hour while listening to nurses and staff joking around in hallways! They should have beds in waiting room instead of chairs!< /Text>< Rating>

Well where to start...
Look can be deceiving it very clean & well keep inside. the lobby is a good size. plenty of room for people to set there!
If your employer make you take a drug test Healthpointe is a nice & welcoming place. Especially the staff they are very polite & not rude at all! (Unlike US Health Works the staff over there are very rude!) But Healthpointe very friendly & polite! I highly recommend this place if your employer sends you here or for any other needs!<//Review>

I’m writing regarding my Physical Therapy experience.  I have been doing PT off and on for the past two years for a neck and shoulder injury.  I just started therapy last week at Healthpointe.  I am extremely excited and completely overjoyed because in just two sessions thus far,  I have better results.  The therapists are very attentive with providing one on one individual therapy.  They are very encouraging and supportive and explain in detail how to do each excercise and the rationale.  They truly focus on my areas of pain and immediately work to provide relief or more comfort even during an exercise.  For the first time in two years, I truly feel that I am on an excellent path to recovery because I am working with Therapists who CARE and are competent in their delivery and guidance with treatment.  I actually look forward to each session!  Thank you Healthpointe Therapists!< /text>

One of the worst clinic I've been to , the staff in charge of the front desk are very unprofessional!!! They ask you if you have any questions even though they never have an answer. We waited to be seen four hours in the heat with no a/c. Only to wait another hour in a room for the dr. Very disappointing how some people think they own the place just 'cause they work there.<//Review>

<Text>If the TV were to be on it should be appropriate for kids as well.... Volume to loud... Almost left the appointment.
Doctors & staff great!
Now a different day. I showed up 40 minutes early and they are 1 hour late.  In my last year and a half of appointments, this establishment is not good with being on time.<//Text>< pics>

I was there L little early and use the bathroom, as I returned to the waiting room they had just called my name and so I went back with one of the physicians. I spoke with them for a very short amount of time  which was spent answering 1 or 2 questions.  I didn’t have enough time one on one too get into any of the issues I’ve been having. Nobody had considered  whether I should be taking my cast off or not until I asked the woman setting up my next appointments at which point I had to wait longer do you see the physician again who is currently with another patient only to find out they can’t remove it I have to go to another location two weeks later.< /Review>

< Review>
I was very impressed w/ this clinic. The staff was awesome...especially the X-ray Technician Armando & the young men that assisted him!! I spent 5 hrs there because it was my initial visit and Dr Katz gave me the option of having the xrays done then rather than return for another appt. An option for which I was very grateful!! I was led, literally by hand, from one room to the next & was offered those cute (ha ha) blue “clown” shorts & booties for my feet that were freezing cold. I would happily recommend Healthpointe to everyone!! Thank you 😊 so much for your tender, loving care!!</Review>

I had an appointment set but that didnt matter because I have been waiting over 2 hours. I lost work time, lost an appointment with a client that was scheduled to happen at this moment and have yet to be seen. The Office wass scheduled to close an hour ago but the wait room still holds 15 people... everyone complained about their 2+ hr wait. Been to other Healthpoint offices but this one has the worst. Id compare this to my last DMV visit buy at least DMV sticks to their scheduled appointments.< /Text>

I have never been treated so unprofessional in my orthopedic career of injury. The staff didn't seem to care if i was happy or not. Doctor Ashley strung me along for 9 months did nothing to cure the problem in my wrist ended up going and seeing another doctor in Newport diagnosed the injury quickly with a plan of action to recover. I would not return to health Pointe Ontario if my life depended on it !!<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I wrote a positive review on Dr Etemad a while back. This is an update on this doctor. I’ve been under his care for months now. On my last visit, We were told by him, that he will be sending me out to see another provider. He hasn’t done anything for me and insurance hasn’t approved my MRI. He stated, he does surgery and cuts. And the other doctor can give me different meds that will work for me. He only knows a few and will see me an a year. Prior to making his decision to referring me out to another doctor. He asked me if I wanted surgery. When I responded, we noticed he wasn’t happy with my response and that’s when he decided to send me out and discharge me. My fam and I were a bit confused because he wasn’t making any sense. We tried to ask for more info but doctor doesn’t give you the opportunity to ask any questions because he’s always walking out the room and ignoring you. He doesn’t care when you want clarification and only spends less then 10 mins on each visit. In the past, We noticed that he lies on his reports to what he tells his patients. I am in the medical field too, so, I document every detail when I leave so I could remember our conversation. Basically, to sum it up! I’ve been seeing him for months and he basically discharged me to another pain management doctor. Doctor Etemad, original plan of care with me was to give me epidural injections, repeat in two months, then again in another two months if it doesn’t work then I would need surgery. This came out of his month and this was his recommendation. It’s not my fault the MRI hasn’t been approved and the insurance denied the injection because they requested a MRI first! He should of given it more time because a week later, my MRI was scheduled. From the result of his decision, I just found out. The insurance cut off my monthly income. Now, I have no ability to pay my rent and other financial obligations. I am very stressed out and depressed Because I most likely will be evicted. Because of his decision to discharge me, It put me in a very difficult situation financially. The only positive thing is, I was finally seen by the provider he referred me to at another Healthpoint facility. The new doctor was confused and couldn’t believe he discharged me without doing anything for me. You can tell he was in shock and couldn’t understand why he would discharge me because he hasn’t done any treatment on me. Thank god this new doctor was very understanding and good bed side manners. He will be doing my injections. And he said, when I need surgery. He will send me out to have the surgery with another provider because he doesn’t do surgery. He was a great doctor and the entire staff were awesome!  A huge difference to Healthpointe in Ontario!! As for management at the Ontario facility, your administration dept should seriously read all the negative reviews that has been written about Dr Etemad on other review sites. I read them when I first begin seeing him but gave him the benefit of the doubt. Now, I know what ppl have said about him on these reviews are correct! Please re-evaluate your doctor and send him to classes how to interact with his patients and not treat them like if they’re just a number and to not do falsification on his reports. I work for a well known medical facility for the last 18 years and they take things like this serious.There priority is patient care. It’s a shame that you can tell he’s here just to receive his paycheck and has no compassion for his patients or bed side manners.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1511919735519, 'text': 'NMA,\nDue to privacy regulations, we can’t discuss any specifics about your comments nor confirm or deny whether you’re a patient of ours.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good staff
For the moment I was well worked ... I hope and continue like this.
I recommend it, especially with Dr.Alupay, Pedro. He is my doctor who specializes in hand and arm pain, with too much experience. Take your time to listen and the time you need to explain your incident. They also have translators so that the understanding between the two is possible.
5 ☆☆☆☆☆ and if you could up to 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ it would put you.
Oh, and they have clinics in different places, and they look for the clinic closest to your home. Just ask and they will kindly provide you with the closest ati.
I am grabbing wing that is located in Ontario, down Mountain Avenue.
Their medical staff, they all do their best so that patients feel safe to be there, if they sometimes take a long time to be treated, but they are always looked after by someone, they may make one or the other exception but the complaint is always respected oh no displeasure, just have to have peace of mind when he expresses his bad treatment, and with all kindness apologize the manager of the place and take action on the matter. Obviously, your appointment will be resumed with another Dr-oh specialist, different from the one who attended you. I'm telling you, because it was an experience that I had, and I'm still your patient there. And I'm comfortable, not for one or two misunderstandings I'm going to change if I've seen my doctor in pain more than 2 times, one especially not going to change my opinion in continuing to go to Healthpointe, Ontario 754 N. for 2 mistakes he had that person.

Buen personal
Por el momento me an travado bien... espero y continuen asi.
Lo recomiendo,en especial con el Dr.Alupay,Pedro. El es mi doctor especialista en dolor de mano y brazo, con demasiada experiencia. Toma su tiempo en escuchar y el tiempo que necesites para poder explicarle tu incidente. Además cuentan con traductores para que sea posible el entendimiento entre los dos.
5 ☆☆☆☆☆ y si se pudiera hasta 10☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  le ponía.
Oh y tienen clínicas en diferentes lugares,y buscan la clínica más cercana a tu hogar. Solo pregunta y ellos con toda amabilidad te facilitaran la más cercana ati.
Yo estoy asiendo ala que está situada en Ontario, por la avenida Mountain Avenue.
Su personal médico, todos hacen lo mejor para que los pacientes se sientan seguros de estar allí,si hay aveces tardan mucho tiempo para poder ser atendido, pero siempre es atendido por alguien, puede que haga una que otra excepción pero siempre es respetada la queja oh disgusto alguno,solo tiene que tener tranquilidad en cuando exprese su mal trato, y con toda la amabilidad se disculpara la mánager del lugar y tomara cartas en el asunto. Obviamente se le repondrá su cita con otro Dr- oh especialista diferente a el que la atendió.  Se los digo,porque fue una experiencia que tuve yo,y aún sigo siendo su paciente de allí. Y estoy agusto,no por uno oh dos mal entendidos voy a cambiar si llevo viendo a mi doctor en dolor más de 2 veses,un especialmente no va a cambiar mi opinión  en seguir yendo a Healthpointe, Ontario 754 N. por 2 errores que tuvo esa persona.

They need to get on there employees! Always putting customers last. Always have customers waiting! I've been coming here for years . They put there customers last and it sucks. But definitely a good place for a hair cut. Just needs better customer service.< /Review>

Great place to watch sports or hang out with friends for few drinks.  But price went up like every other places.  No more combo deals.  I noticed that people order minimal and leave sooner than I expected.. I think it's the price.  Just for my self I spent $55.  I wish they can offer combo deals like before.< /Text>

I am a Filipino who happens to also love Korean food! The bar is like a chill bar where in you and your friends can go. Lots of Koreans, but they don't make you feel uncomfortable in any way. The food, FANTASTIC. Korean as it is. My love for ramen will never die plus rice roll!</Review>

<Text>When in Buena Park looking for a decent bar with very good Korean bar food, this is the place to go. Beer selection as well as Korean wines and liquor are available. Food comes from the restaurant that is connected next door. Korean K-POP music videos and sports are shown on their large screen TVs.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhMjYwWRvQ6TlLLr8kmSRTm-ojPvX2HjXUNxQ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ6F2CFLW-doyksdBs-OO4hr_sObumaB6m5EPU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfpD3Zl1uo6btN-Lsf5IdcmIc0-iapriVtUaS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjRzAmujIHx7j6i1xtPYSFJ8XF_NbvU8zjemyF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjNkf9XPspXGXU0nliualHt7IH90Si6CQy9lZ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUhQ3oJs3A4Bk-SQK1Pmn3UzoJmeO2vylwizTG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWWZAk11zw1cxfieXncl9iT4UdG-g5Qyi-nsO4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSMYiLFacFY7GY0I17fS1DRcMp7tFEsyTnPZAK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGxUMn_4oItrbrcP2kAARnQ_wv1_-xAoEhmK6b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhhfHAYbbbNEsyuG6RYirzA8skPh5s225P9KLM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnI3DHIkv4d1nIfUtGMvD75tqMxsu6x3wrIPSd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxYF-HqJ8_RWdhtvM2wwF741G_KLa91HEWgcOU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2b0ab970371d:0x54371584947ad3d8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The waitress had us sit outside even after we asked to sit inside.  There were a lot of people smoking in the parking lot and it really bothered us but she still wouldn't let us go inside even though other people were eating inside. She was not attentive and we always had to try a lot to get her attention. They get two stars because the food was really good even though the service was terrible.< /Text>< pictures>

Went here for some beer with a group of friends after our cricket game at the Smith Murphy park. Liked the collection of beers. Service was good. We ordered spicy wings which were good but the popcorn chicken wasnt that good. Definitely worth a try for a quick drink.<//text>

< Review>
One of the last Korean bars in the area. The OG pine tree is gone, minsok Chon been gone like 20 times, and I don't want to go-to Hawaiian Gardens.

They have the right kind of chicken beer soju combos although I don't like how they butterfly the chicken, but that's because new school I suppose.

I usually end up here every time I'm back in the LA / Orange County area. Great place to catch up with the old crew.< /Review>

Likely one of the best Korean bars for drinks and food. Big menu. Tastes are pretty good. Attached to a quick food Korean restaurant and they share a kitchen.</Text>

<Review>There is always an open table at this korean bar. It's pretty ambient with kpop music. The corn cheese we ordered was not that satisfying though.. I think this place is just good for mainly drinks.<//Review><UserId.>108742239400720991305<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) Moderate Korean snack bar and hop-style place. The snack bar and the bar are connected together. The liquor is very distinctive and tastes great. There is also a Korean billiard room nearby and Boba drink shop.

<Text>Dedicated GLUTEN FREE Mexican food. A rare find indeed. They have delicious food and wonderful individualized service. If there are other ingredients you cannot have they will happily substitute if they can. Each dish   pictured below was delicious. The Ceviche is normally prepared with serrano peppers, but since I can't eat hot peppers they prepared a Ceviche without the peppers and it was wonderful!  The salad had an orange juice dressing that was delicious! And the bottom layer on the taco was a very thin layer of black beans, YUM.  They are located on Shattuck in Berkeley and I will return.😋♥️🦋🙏</Text><user>106601405107633825998< /user><Date>1566794830145<//Date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpaATngxVXgGarUnnxiWtsFLnNTYd4LGn1sVlx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6nBgZQoKVHtzHa75bqQUIZlCe-FSXMAcgStdZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-Sr6QEZrJliKtiMcxiavG0Iw-HQErXx7vS3ha=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< gmap_id>

<Text>This is a small family-run restaurant that serves wonderful light Mexican food.  I loved the ceviche which is served with house made chips.  The tortillas are all corn and you have a choice of fillings for your enchiladas that include potatoes.  I had the tomatillo enchiladas with cheese.  They were delicious.</Text>< Pictures>

I think I’ve just had the best Mexican food of my life here.  It makes me seriously consider moving to Berkeley.  And I ordered huevos rancheros. Not exciting, right?  Wrong!  Each component of the dish was excellent on its own, from the flavorful bed of black beans, to the lightly fried homemade tortillas, to the fried eggs, and the spicy spoonful of thick salsa on top.  Together, it was so delicious and comforting.  The food here is obviously made with care, and you can taste and feel it.

I couldn’t just try one dish, so I also ordered the tortilla soup, which was also very enjoyable.  It would be great to order for takeout if you are sick.  It’s a huge portion and I’d suggest sharing, so you can eat another dish.  There are so many things to try on the menu.

I also ordered the horchata, which is now my favorite horchata, because it is not too sweet. I can drink it without my tastebuds being overstimulated by sugar.

Prices are very reasonable, service is great, and the food is incredible.  I can’t wait to come back and try more items on the menu.< /Text>

In addition, it's connected to La Pena which has been there since 1975 showing plays, live music and other community activities.</text></record></dataset><record>

A little expensive, but you're probably paying for better than standard quality.

<Text>I'm no expert of Mexican cuisine, but I can probably say with some confidence that Los Cilantros offers dishes that are not commonly find in cheap eateries, and of superior quality. Perhaps the price is a bit on the higher end, considering the area (next to la Peña). Nice ambience with wide tables and lots of space inbetween. Definitely recommemded.</Text><Date>1531280360274<//Date></record>

My coworker and I just tried this place based on the rating and price($) posted on Google. Nice people and cool atmosphere. Based on the extremely expensive price and how long it took, we expected it to be a lot of food. We were very disappointed to see 3 very small street tacos that were "ok" and nothing else that came with the meal. For the price we paid we expected a lot more! We were both still hungry after this meal. Save your time and money and do not go here. We will not make that mistake again.</text>

We were going to another place for Mexican  Dinner and we came across this place we checked their review and liked their decorations so we thought we would try it instead. We,my husband who is part Cuban and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality of their food and service. The Flan was amazing. The Ceviche was fresh and yummy.
Ropa Vieja was delicious and true to form.We will be back👍👍👍😊😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️< /Review>

Everything about this place is good--the food, the service, the setting. A bit pricey though. There should be more restaurants like this. Fortunately I live around the corner so I can go here often.<//Review>

<Date>1423354551739</Date><text>Two hours after leaving Los Cilantros I still have the sound of satisfaction resonating through my system.  The sweet feeling of having had a home cooked meal where you don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients.  The sensation that I just had the very best possible with the added southern Mexican, spicy, balmy flavor from Oaxacan terroir.  Authentic Southern Mexican cuisine!  The food is testy! Best tacos, best tamales ever! Their mole sublime! When you bite into the chicken you know it was a healthy chicken with texture and flavor.  The white corn masa sweetness is incomparable, and organic!  The place is calm and very comfortable with big, sturdy, wooden tables and seats. Spacious but not chi-chi or pretentious and the personnel cordial and courteous.  I can't wait to get back for their enchiladas!< /text><username>Gilles Marin< /username><resp>None<//resp><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x80857e7f51885305:0xd0b8eb4feb2f943c<//gmap_id>< Pics>

On the hunt for good food, I stumbled in by accident on the suggestion of a local.  The carnitas and soup are fantastic.  The flan is not far behind.  Nice, out of the way, very friendly folks.</text>

<Review>This is the kind of home cooked food that taps into memories of my best  childhood meals. The flavors of each dish are complex and satisfying. From the spicy, smokey mole enchiladas, to barbacoa that melts in your mouth, to the tender saucy chicken tinga tacos. The brunch dishes are what you might find at many Mexican restaurants, but at Los Cilantros they have been perfected. It's easy to feel you're at home in the kitchen of Chef-owner Dilsa Lugo.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I've eaten here about 6 times now and I'm amazed at how delicious and consistent their food is. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in their homemade masa, corn tortillas, and traditional dishes from Cuernavaca, Morelos in Mexico. Even their aguas frescas taste like they are made with love. I like to come here before a show at La Peña Cultural Center, which the restaurant shares its space with! You will not be disappointed!<//text>

<Text>Such a great time! This theater is definitely up and coming. We have been there twice in the last few months and both visit were great. We watched one in 2D and one in 4D, the 4D was very fun, beware the seats move a ton! It was so much fun, will definitely be back.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSdr5JUMqn4iYHd-hTjH19QyqzzAVB1kIvCHyt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWSRj3VYb48ehmEBjSPyjTknk4J1XuVvXcYTDr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c297fb7562afbd:0x62a58cc8ed3a4d3f<//gmap_id></record>

< review>
Just saw my first movie back in theaters and I loved it here, it was clean and the employees were friendly. I easily purchased my ticket onsite at one of their kiosk machines then proceeded to theater. Their prices are shockingly good compared to other movie locations in the city, I also couldn't believe the low prices of the concessions were. I'm not sure if the prices will stay this low, but for now I'll enjoy it as much as I can. My only complaint is that the seats don't recline back as far as I'd like and they're a little hard, but surely they'll get softer as they get broken in more.  It feels great to be back at the theater.< /review>

<Text>Watched Fast 9 here at the 4DX theater. The experience was incredibly fun and we’d definitely do it again.
Even if you aren’t doing 4DX it’s still a beautiful theater which is decorated and kept very clean. Highly recommended!< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
First time here, theater is nice and clean. Concessions are limited and a bit pricey. Bad experience with the Nacho tray. It’s cheap plastic and the weight of the cheese sauce caused it to fold and both tortilla chips and cheese fell on my leg. Very disappointed with the comfort of chairs, they don’t recline much.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I live close to NOHO West and finally got a chance to go to this theater recently, and I can easily say this theater will now be my to-go theater. It's clean, has friendly staff, very comfy spacious seats, and terrific picture and sound quality—way better than the ARCLight Cinemas, in my opinion.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I went to see the Movie F9, was not able to sit through it, because of the chairs, I have sort of a bad back. With this New technology, going forward, these New sets, people should have the opinion to be able to turn off the technology. New technology is not for All people  !!!<//Review>< Rate>

The staff were nice, but the women's bathroom was really dirty for such a new theater. I'm sure that once they get a full staff they'll work it out.</text>

I say everyone should try 4dx at least once.  Just don't be eating too much concession stand food at the time, or else you'll smear your face with it 😀< /Text>

i purchased my parking pass the day before dropping my vehicle off and it's a pretty good price. i'm sure there are closer locations or better prices but the reason i purchased at this parking garage is because of the shuttle. they were quick getting us to the terminal and back to the parking garage as well. it does fill up quickly though so be sure to make your reservation ahead of time.<//Text>

<time>1622000444748<//time><rate>5</rate><Review>I have parked my car at the Parking Spot for years and like the service and sense that my car is safe and will be waiting for me just as I left it when I return.  A recent visit found me limping into the garage with a flat tire with little time to spare to catch my flight.  The valet parking attendant told me not to worry, they would put the car safely away and I could deal with it on my return.  I asked whether they could arrange to have the flat replaced with my spare tire and to add the cost to my bill.  The attendant said he would try.

When I returned, I was dreading that it might take me some time to sort out the problem.  I was happily surprised to find my car waiting for me with the spare tire installed at no charge.   I inquired about the replacement of the tire and was told the employees took it upon themselves to change it.   It was a pleasure to leave a tip in appreciation and gratitude.  A business that provides a reliable level of good service, yet can still surprise with exceptional assistance that goes above and beyond, will always have my patronage.<//Review>< pictures>

Spacious and clean parking lot with indoor and outdoor spaces. The main advantage of this place is not in the garage itself, but in the shuttles. They are clean and most importantly regular. On my previous trip I used another parking lot and upon arrival I was waiting for the shuttle for about an hour, that day I counted that the yellow shuttles go more often than others.</Review></record>

<text>I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to book since there are so many mixed reviews online but I'm so glad I did.  Everything was completely easy and smooth.  I booked everything online and downloaded the app as an extra way to keep organized.  The drop off was a complete breeze. A shuttle was waiting for us the moment we stepped out of the elevator and dropped us off right outside of our terminal. Upon our return I used the app to get the shuttle to pick us up.  The app is really great and shows you in live time where the shuttles are so you're not guessing how much longer it will be. You can literally follow the dots along the map as they move through the route.  I will definitely be booking again.  No more dealing with rideshare waiting times and outrageous price hikes during "Peak" hours.<//text>< Pictures>

<time>1620515620426<//time><rate>5</rate><text>Parking in LA is expensive.  That's a given.  LA can also be a callous place as far as service is concerned, having lived there many years, I've come to expect as much.  So after my wife and I both convened at LAX, both coming in from separate long trips to return to our car and then drive 4 hours north, we were not expecting to be treated so kindly by the shuttle driver that would bring us back to the Century Blvd garage.  I wish I had thought to ask his name.  First, I saw the shuttle and waived.  He saw me and pointed to where he was going to stop (which was about 50 yards from where we were).  To my disbelief he graciously remained there as it took me about a minute to jog to his location (I thought for sure he'd stop and then press on before my wife caught up to me).  He was so kind and thoughtful, he made sure he dropped us off close to where our car would be and then let us know how we could apply our AAA discount.  It's the little things you know?  So from that experience, we'd come back to The Parking Spot any time.< /text>< pictures>

Always have a great experience at The Parking Spot garage. Friendly staff, busses run constantly, easy to use entry and exit, hassle free. I never worry about my vehicle being parked inside The Parking Spot garage, one less stress to worry about while being gone.<//review>

Liked the pre-pay option, touchless check in/out, nearness to LAX, easily identifiable buses/location, app w/ lo-jacked buses.  Be sure to have 'Location' (GPS) turned on for app to work.

At LAX, catch the shuttle bus on Level 2, the one with the white, Y-shaped street lights (Hotels & Private Parking).<//review>

<text>They have an app, and they have a 24-hr shuttle. This is as convenient as it gets. With LAX E Lot closed, this is a good alternative, and actually even better. If you need to extend beyond your reservation, you don't have to do anything. It's great!<//text>< pictures>

The Parking Spot was very easy  and  convenient to get to. Resevering and paying ahead via the app or website was very simple. The check in process was fast and easy. The shuttles were fast and easy to find. The shuttle drivers were nice and accommodating.<//text>

Highly recommend, my family used the parking spot to store our car for 4 days as we traveled. We pulled in parked and immediately were shuttled to airport. When we returned we went out to designated spot and immediately boarded the Suttle to pick up our vehicle. Amazing service..</review>

If you download the app you can preorder your parking and just scan the QR code and park. It’s got a bathroom and provides water when the pandemic isn’t happening. The shuttle busses are very prompt and the drivers are always very helpful!< /Text>< Pictures>

The service was seamless and reasonably priced! Shuttles were always available for expeditious delivery of my children, my luggage, and me to and from our terminals! My vehicle was just as I had left it, and I was pleased that it was under constant security and movement in the parking structure. The drivers were extremely helpful and went out of their ways to help load heavy luggage on and off their shuttles. They were clean, pleasant, and professional! I will definitely use the parking spot in the future!< /text>

This is the ONLY place I use for LAX parking. Tried other services and I just got frustrated. You can reserve a spot here up to 12 hours prior I believe. You scan your code (photo included) and you're good to go.
Shuttles come no more then 15-20 minutes and take you directly to your terminal.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH OTHER SERVICES. Use The Parking Spot.<//text>

<Review>Parked my Nissan Armada there for 8 days and no problems with security there. Prepay is the best, AAA discount as well. No problem with parking and no problem with waiting for shuttles. They are constantly running. Did not wait at all for the shuttle when we parked. Waited about 10 minutes when we landed at LAX. Just follow the directions in the app when you land. Easy in and out with the app. We will park our car here again.<//Review></record>

When we arrived, we were a bit confused on where to go. We talked to Ernie at the site. She helped us find where to park AND ensured our reservation was taken care of. She even called me when we were waiting for the shuttle to confirm she had made the changes on our reservation and ensured we wouldn’t get charged extra. The driver was also amazing, answered all of our questions and she gave us tips on where to go when we returned. I will definitely be using them again! Such great customer service!!!!</Text>< Pics>

They seem to have more shuttles than most or maybe just easier to spot.  Locations are good to get in and out of LAX while avoiding the more congested areas.<//text>

Of course when we got back, it also didn't work, we had to find someone to let it out, will not use again, who needs the stress. They didn't even apologize, just wanted our email that we paid, made us look like bad guys, while we where stressing.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2b6da0dfff2e1:0xb529433611b431fd<//GmapID><Response>{'time': 1618241266457, 'text': 'Hi Laurie,\nWe do apologize for the troubles you had at check-in and checkout!

The bus drivers, particularly on Bus 70, will not enforce mask policy. I got on the bus today and at least half the people were wearing their masks under their noses. I counted five people. I travel a lot for work. *This is the second time in six days* this issue has come up.
When I complained on the bus, the passengers laughed at me. And the bus driver would not enforce.

I complained to the front office. Spoke to a guy named Abeer. Or Amir. I did not hear the inflection very well. They just said the bus driver "can't control" what happens on the bus. Didn't even write anything down.

There is no number for corporate customer service -- I called their Sepulveda office and they confirmed the same.

If you cannot trust their mask policy, you cannot really trust any of their other promises. I think I'm going somewhere else from now on.< /Text>

I used The Parking Spot LAX on Century December 8th-10th and had absolutely no problems. I made my reservations using their app, arrived and self-parked on the rooftop with ease. Got to the lower level and there was a shuttle bus already waiting and immediately took us to the airport. Once we arrived back I requested our shuttle, picked up our luggage and waited less than 5 minutes at the designated shuttle bus pickup spot. Once I seen the shuttle bus I waved it down due to the fact other shuttle buses besides The Parking Spot picks up in the exact same location. The driver that dropped us off at the airport was the same driver who picked us up. He greeted us and helped bring our luggage aboard. I definitely will be using their service again.< /Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Significantly cheaper than parking at LAX and their shuttles run constantly so it's very convenient. If you download the app and sign up they give you 2 free nights. The only catch, which they don't tell you up front, is that the 2 free nights have to be used on your next visit. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Recent new Spot Club member here and had my first experience Dec 2020 at the Century location. I usually park at the Hilton, Westin, Marriott, but came across Parking Spot and decided to try them out.

My first experience I opted for the rooftop but when I checked in one of the attendants said it was fine to park in one of the covered spots, which I did. When I returned I was surprised my parking fee was higher so I addressed this with David the manager at Century. He explained that his attendant was wrong for giving me that direction and said I have to park on the roof next time as there's another gate there. He was very accommodating and friendly and professional and was able to credit me my earlier rooftop estimate.

I also like Parking Spot bc you can track with the mobile app the pickup vans at LAX, which I wasn't able to do with Hilton, Westin, Marriott.

I'm a fan of Parking Spot and the Century and would recommend this location.<//review>

The Parking Spot on Century Blvd is very convenient to LAX.  We pulled right in, parked, and the shuttle was there almost immediately to take us to the airport.  We were very pleased.<//Review>

I love the parking lot. Excellent customer service the lot staff are very helpful. The drivers are very polite and they have buses running all the time so you never wait for a long time for a shuttle. They have "free" water bottle right by the lot exits. I love it. I'm now a loyal customer!!!!</Text>

Excellent service. Prompt, efficient and reliable.  There are no surprises. For LAX parking, I highly recommend the Parking Spot.  It is the second parking facility at LAX that I have used and much better than my first experience. No need to try any other service. Have used three time over the past year and remain very satisfied< /review>

Reservations were seamless, price was right, vValet parking went very smoothly. The shuttle literally took minutes to get us to LAX.  Coming back the wait was a little longer, but not more than expected, given it was one of the "super peak" days of the holiday season.  I would not hesitate to use them again,</Review>< Pics>

First time customer. I choose The Parking Spot because I always see their yellow pick up vehicles circling around the airport frequently. However, that was not my experience when I actually arrived back into LAX. I had to wait 40 minutes for my pickup which was extremely disappointing. I spotted one of their vehicles and flagged her down and Inquired about the C bus and the driver replied “I don’t know” then shut her door and drove off,  it was extremely rude. She offered zero information and didn’t show any concern or even answer my questions. I would like to make a formal complaint, I hope management will see this and get in touch with me as soon as possible.
This happened approximately 9:45 PM p.m. June 29th 2020.
When my driver actually picked me up he was apologetic about the delay. The rude “S”bus driver showed zero concern and had terrible customer service skills, and a terrible attitude.</Text>

I arrived late, to find my car battery dead. It was about 11pm, I immediately called triple A. The security guard drove by, I stopped him and he immediately assisted. He came back immediately and started my car. After a long day of travel, he saved the day!<//Text>

<text>My one tip: Use their app to make a reservation for their valet service.  Until pricing changes their valet rate is almost the same as their no-reservation-covered parking rate.

Things I like about The Parking Spot:
Their shuttles are distinctive and easily recognizable so you can see them coming from a distance.
Their shuttles are constantly passing through the arrival area so it's quick, easy and convenient to get back to your car quickly
Upon arrival at the structure their valet service has your car waiting for you
Use your QR code from their app on the way out for quick and easy exiting from the structure
They have complimentary refrigerated bottled water for your drive home at the valet reception and the driveway exit

My plug for The Parking Spot:  This long standing service has been the best place to park when traveling out of LAX for decades but they are constantly finding ways to increase efficiencies and improve traveler conveniences.  Try using their app to make a reservation for their valet service and you'll be hooked too.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We’ve used the parking spot twice already and our experience has been absolute perfection. We did not have to worry about our car at all. We decided to use the valet option this last trip. Our flight came in late and when we pulled up our car was already waiting for us. That definitely helped us get on our way after a long flight. We will always use the parking spot!<//Text>

<date>1542778971598</date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>'The Parking Spot' was very competitive compared to other lots, and a great deal when compared to hiring a shuttle service and all the positive aspects I have listed below:

Very easy to use. The phone app makes check-in / check-out a snap.
Clean, well lit covered parking structure made us feel safe.  Close to the airport, but not so close as to be affected by traffic.  Plenty of clean, easy to spot from a distance shuttle buses, "I don't think we had to wait longer than 10 minutes before our shuttle bus (Century lot) came by."  Friendly, helpful shuttle bus drivers.

We looked at hiring a shuttle bus to pick us up and drop us off at LAX for our trip to Seattle, but at $60 dollars a person (x4)... no thanks. 10 am traffic to LAX was lite, but I was still worried that I would not be able to find the lot, not so, painted bright yellow with big black dots you can tell right away where it was.  Things went so smoothly using 'The Parking Spot' even my wife was impressed and that is saying something.  Would I use 'The Parking Spot' again? "In a heart beat".<//Review>< pics>

Secure location.. AAA member's get 10% off total bill. Must provide membership upon payment.

Avoid the over head sprinklers. They tend to leak and will stain your paint due to the heavy water. Parking spots are plenty spacious.

Valet service available for a fee... Parking is charged per day... roof top is 17$ and self park is 21$ and valet is 25$. Car wash service also available for a fee.<//Review>

I was a first time user and everything was spelled out about what I needed to do for check in and check out. This was fantastic! The app was especially great for checking out (the exit procedures tab) since I had just traveled for 14 hours. Divers were polite and courteous, even at 4 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. The wait times for the shuttle were excellent. No more than 5-7 minutes on either side. It really does make it a wonderful experience to travel 14 hours, deplane, get luggage, and then wait only 5 minutes for a clean shuttle to pick you up from the island at LAX (as opposed to 30 minutes+). It may be pricier than other places, but you get what you pay for. In this case, it was clear instructions for check in and out, lots of covered parking, parking spaces large enough to accommodate large vehicles, professional staff, and clean shuttles that make the rounds within 5-10 minutes so you can getting moving with your day. I would recommend this service.</review>

I love the parking spot. I know I can find cheaper airport parking but the parking spot is so convenient. I can make reservations online and prepay. The valet parking is so worth it. Good price and I never have to wait for them to bring me my car. The driver tells them to bring my car out the moment I board the shuttle. I have never had to wait more than 5 mins for a shuttle to or from the airport. They help me with my bags which is great if I’m traveling alone or need help with the car seat. It’s so easy. Treat yo’self!</review>

UNSAFE TO PARK - Do Not Park Here!

BE AWARE OF VANDALISM AND THEFT at The Parking Spot.

I returned from a 4-day business trip to find my PASSENGER WINDOW BROKEN, my PERSONAL ITEMS STOLEN from inside my locked glove box, my NAVIGATION SCREEN CRACKED and parts of my dashboard & valuables were strewn along the floor of my vehicle.

Additionally, my passenger window remained broken and uncovered during heavy rains. Management failed to notify me of theft or take any measures to further protect my vehicle. Any personal items that were not stolen during the original break-in remained accessible from my broken passenger window for anyone walking by to steal.

Management DENIED RESPONSIBILITY and are unwilling to pay for any damages despite them having insurance. They do not have security cameras to protect your vehicle and limit their surveillance to only the entrance and exit of the complex. Despite my vehicle having sat with a broken window for several days, they didn't even bother to make a police report.

My business partner, our employees and I have been using The Parking Spots for several years. We have provided them thousands of dollars in revenue. The profits they have generated from our past business far exceeds the cost to repair my vehicle and still, they have refused any financial assistance to repair my vehicle that was damaged while on their property and in their care.

The parking spot will not keep your vehicle safe from thieves and will do nothing to help you if your vehicle is damaged or personal items are stolen.< /text>

I like EVERYTHING about your service.  from how easy it is to drop off/pick up my vehicle to the treatment I receive from everyone.I have been using the Parking Spot Century for years now and not once have I had a bad experience.

Even when my keys were misplaced on one of the times I parked there- this was incredible what they did for me.  Because of the inconvenience of misplacing my keys, the manager gave me a full refund of over $240 - no one does that these days.

Thank you for making it easy for me to use your services - I would give you a million stars any given day!  Happy new year!< /text>

I have used The Parking Spot (LAX—Century) for years. In addition to the convenience of the location and the ease of parking, I’ve been impressed with the continuous improvements in service over the years.

I mean, think about it: it’s a parking garage with an airport shuttle. The basics of that haven’t changed. So, what’s to improve? Well, the mobile app has evolved to become the one tool I need to use Parking Spot. I make a reservation, get pricing options, reserve my spot. I use the app to enter the garage, update my arrival time, track the wait time for the nearest shuttle, and pay and exit when I’m done.  I can easily add my reservation to my travel app, too.

I like everything about The Parking Spot. Everything!!! I mean, I wouldn’t say No to cheaper prices.... The competition is a ride service, the airport or an indulgent friend. Parking Spot understands that a parking space is a transitory need with other options. For me, they are the best option.</Text>

The valet option is excellent. We dropped off our car and walked right onto the bus to take us to the terminal. On the way back we exited the bus and our car was waiting. Our bags were in our car and ready to go within 2 minutes. Great friendly staff...<//Review>

<review>I am loving this place. I’ve dropped my car off here a few times now and used the valet service. The shuttles are alway right there waiting and when you get back into town, I have never had a long wait for a return shuttle. For my shorter trips, it is cheaper than a shuttle or Ride share< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Everything went perfectly smoothly. I especially liked the return service -- I got off the plane, told the app I was there, the shuttle appeared, and my car was ready and waiting (complete with chilled water bottle) when we got to the garage. Couldn't have been any easier.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

This experience could not have been any better! When I arrived on Friday morning there weren't any spots available in the section I made my reservation for, so I was upgraded to valet for no additional cost. Was so stoked! When I arrived back last night to LAX, the shuttle arrived within 45 seconds to pick me up. When the shuttle got back to the garage, my car was already pulled up and ready to go, someone took my bags immediately and checkout only took 1 minute. This service was hands down amazing, especially for being a Sunday night after a holiday weekend! I will definitely be recommending The Parking Spot to all my friends and family, and use this service again in the future! Thanks again!</Text>

Its easy to get to and easy on day of departure. However, when waiting for buses after you arrive it takes forever! Sepulvda buses drive by over and over, while Century buses never seem to come. If they can fix this, it would be so much better.< /Review>

<Text>This place is amazing.  Clean, bright and organized.  Quite up to date in term of technology making your check in and check easier.  You could do all your reservation online and you will get a printout with QR code and plus all kind of other coupon.  Scan your QR code during check in and you are done.  Since it is QR code,  I assume that you could also have it on the phone too.  Welcome to the modern day world.</Text>< pics>

The prices have really shot through the roof, which is a little disappointing as I've parked here for years.  The support have always been very friendly and helpful when I need it.  Having to make a reservation is an added complication in a hectic travel world.  Someday I'll get used to it, or just fly out of San Diego.  My shuttle experience was much better this time than in the past, so that was a nice surprise.<//Text>

<review>The valet service made traveling super easy! We were greeted and on a shuttle to LAX within a few minutes of arriving at The Parking Spot. When we returned a shuttle picked us up to take us back to our car within 2 minutes of exiting the airport. The Parking Spot's valet service was very affordable (less than shuttle service) and an all around great experience! Everyone was super friendly and helpful! Highly recommend !!<//review>< Gmap_id>

And the manager and drivers were awesome in helping us recover bags we had left on the shuttle accidentally upon drop off. They all worked together to get the bags back to us quickly and with such sincere helpfulness! THIS is why we stay with The Parking Spot. Thank you!<//Review>< pictures>

EVERYTHING!  The easy access, the attentive personnel, how easy it was to transfer our bags for car to shuttle.  The parking staff, shuttle drivers and office workers were Great!  We added the car wash and my wife said that was the cleanest she has seen our car in years!  When we finally arrived on a flight that was 1.5 hours late and after 11pm, the shuttle was right there waiting for us!!  I will never park anywhere else when traveling from LAX!!</Review>

Over an hour shuttle didn't show, took Uber to get our long term parking. Paid twice. Redundancy. Other shuttles passed us over 5 times and still no parking spot. Got to garage, the shuttle idling in the midlle of the garage. I won't use again.< /Text>

I've had a good experience with the parking spot multiple times.  It may not be the cheapest place to part for LAX but it is very convenient.  The shuttle bus drivers are considerate, always looking to see if people are waiting to be picked up and doing their best not to miss them -- just realize they have two garages and be sure to get on the right bus, Century or Sepluveda.</text>

<review>Amazing service.  Paid a few bucks extra to valley and what a deal.  Our shuttle woman was great.  She called ahead to make sure our car was ready and there it was.  Arriving at 1am in the morning - it was greatly appreciated.  We got bottled water on the way there and that ALSO was refreshing since we were traveling 10+ hours!  BRAVO won't use anyone else now< /review>< pictures>

The staff are friendly. The shuttles to and from the parking garage run very often so you are never left waiting for very long at all. They also have free water bottles in the parking garage which is nice coming off of the planes.< /review>

Their ticketing machine did not spit a parking ticket yet let our car in. We told the guards about the technical issue and they decided to charge us $37 for parking only 15min and without a ticket. Horrible service. DO NOT RECOMMEND. PARK ELSEWHERE
what a scam.< /Review>

Unsafe to park - Do Not Park Here! The parking spot will not keep your vehicle safe from thieves and will do nothing to help you if your vehicle is damaged or personal items are stolen. Never recommended this Parking Spot Century - lax Airport.</review>

I was using the Marriott LAX Parking but really was such a disaster each time. I gave the Parking Spot a try and it was so easy - almost felt too easy! I did the valet service and they treated me like a special guest from beginning to end. I'll definitely do it again!< /text>

<Review>Easy in. Easy out. Friendly, helpful employees. The Parking Spot is a safe, relatively inexpensive place to park your car. Roof parking is less expensive than inside, lower-floor parking.  Free, comfortable bus service to and from LAX.  Board The Parking Spot's yellow, polka dot bus curbside, in front of "Baggage Claim."  Make sure the bus you take goes to the lot where you parked. There are a number of The Parking Spot garages. This review describes the Century Boulevard structure.  While you are on your trip, the car can be detailed.  It nice to come home to a shiny, clean car.  Discount are usually available on the internet; check their website. One nice touch; they give the driver and passengers free bottles of chilled water.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Excellent and convenient to the airport.  When I arrived back from my business I waited less than 5 minutes before being picked up.  I opted for a car wash while I was away as well since I don't have all the time in the world.  Truck was spotless.  The Parking Spot does not disappoint.< /Text><UserId.>100426105004747949141< /UserId.>< rating>

I've been using Spot for 10+ years. I love you guys! Your drivers are always very kind and helpful. I get to my gate quickly and when I return I get back to my car fast, too. I like earning reward points towards free parking. All this makes the Spot my spot for airport parking!< /Review>

Easy access to LAX.. convinience! . Staff is great, helpful and fast!! We use the valet service , reasonably priced.  They know where you need to be, and so they take care of you and your car as soon as you stop..luggage out of the trunk and to curb... water bottle supplied!. ( travel quite a bit) This last time, l had to leave the car at "will call"...l dropped it off, (flew away)and someone else (coming back  in a flight sooner than mine) went to pick it up. That process was simple, secure, detailed and so thanks! to the very helpful staff!<//text>

<Text>It is my opinion that this is the place to park when you go to Los Angeles airport. It is not the cheapest. It is however totally convenient. The entrance is on Century Boulevard and you can register with the parking spot and get a pass card. You pull in did you take your information and you get on a shuttle bus. That takes approximately 325 minutes. You take the shuttle bus to your gate and they give you a ticket you have the choice of parking on the roof doing self parking or valet parking. I always choose valet parking, it is only a dollar or two more and completely convenient. When you come back, you make sure you get on the right parking spot bus there is a Sepulveda one as well as the Century Boulevard one and you go back to the parking spot. If you have the liepard you will have already given the driver your ticket and your car will be waiting for you. By the way you do collect points if you go there a lot.</Text>< Pics>

Your customer service is outstanding! We recently left for a family vacation and were cutting it close for an international flight. We had just passed through TSA screening when my wife found she left one of our carry-on bags on the Spot shuttle. Our flight was scheduled to board in 20 minutes. I immediately called your office and the associate said she would get it to the next driver going out and would call me when he was near my terminal. Sure enough, he got me the bag and I made it to the gate just as the flight was boarding. A family vacation saved! Much thanks go out to the staff and the great service. I'll definitely recommend you to my friends and family. Thanks!< /Review>

STAY AWAY!! Payed for Valet service, received my car dirtier with grass clippings on right side of car, and my door was dented! I discovered it 3 days later after taking it out of my garage where i parked it upon returning from airport. Came in on a late flight so I didn't check it. If you are still going to park at this joint, ALWAYS check your car. Once you leave forget about filing a claim. You've been WARNED. In case your wondering if it could have happened somewhere else, it didn't. I hand was my car, it's 3 months old and I know every dent and scratch because there aren't any, only after having valet parked it at The Parking Spot. I spoke to GM and expressed, I did not feel the need to check the car that night, HELL, I payed for Valet, my car should have been fine. GM said it was impossible it had any debris after being parked there. Well...that just makes it worse. Maybe the workers were pissed that I didn't get the washing service or worse yet, it was driven off the lot???<//text>

It's LA!  Secure parking to leave your auto while you fly away to Hawaii.  Shuttle service to and from LAX.  Give yourself extra time to get this done.  Remember your parking spot number.  I put it in cell phone.  Reasonable pricing.  Colorful company vehicles.<//review>

<Review>The Parking Spot is the only place I park my car when going to LAX.  The location on Century is so easy to access from the 405 FWY and their website is user friendly.  They have a constant fleet of shuttles coming to pick you up after returning and are never overcrowded.  Their drivers are safe and experienced.  The price is well worth all you get for just a few dollars more than the airport lots.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

<review>The parking spot was convenient and easy. A shuttle was there right after I parked my car to take me to LAX and a shuttle was there right after I landed back in LA X to take me back to my car. Great customer service at the cashier and it was just a peace of mind knowing my car was safe and everything was easy.</review><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

<Text>I travel out of LAX about once per month and park my car here every time.  It's pretty simple. The place is clean, safe, convenient and the drivers are friendly. You can park on the roof at a discount which is what I usually do. I've never missed a flight since the vans leave every 5 minutes. You may find cheaper parking, but you can beat the over all experience at The Parking Spot.</Text>< Time>

Although there were long lines of cars when I arrived (the day before Christmas), things were handled. Wry smoothly and efficiently.  I was able to catch the 3rd shuttle to the airport, with very little waiting in line.  When I returned, I called the number on my ticket and a shuttle came within a few minutes.  When I arrived at the Parking Spot, my car was waiting at the curb.  They took my suitcase from the shuttle and put it into my trunk, while I paid at the window (which only took a few moments).  Definitely my best experience at getting to and from LAX.  Thank you for making this such a painless experience!<//text>

Great Service! The high frequency of courteous and helpful shuttle drivers, combined with the great location, security, convenience, and comfort that the parking facilities offer, make the Parking Spot a champion for Parking choices I have faced throughout my past.<//Text>

I like everything about The Parking Spot including great customer service and the fact you never have to wait long for a courtesy van for pickup. And I like the coupons. Excellent company all away around.</Review>

Easy to find lot, service was professional, helpful and fast! Shuttles come often, just flag them down if they haven't already stopped. I chose the valet service and my car was waiting for me when I arrived from the airport.< /text>

<text>Well worth the extra few bucks over that other ghastly space nearby.  The staff is great, they're fast, friendly and professional.  Do the valet with the cleaning and your car is ready, clean and waiting when you get off your flight.  Love this place!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

We drove in, parked on the top, hopped on the waiting transportation and they dropped us off in front of our airlines.  When we came back home, we went up to the departure deck and as we got there a transportation vehicle was just pulling up.  We hopped in and were dropped off where are car was parked.  Drove to the exit, paid and we were done.  Fast, simple, and easy.  We plan to do it again next trip to LAX.<//text><date>1488817909355< /date>< Name>

The Parking Spot is always top-notch.  Excellent service and complete safety offered each time.  Car is always pristine and price is always right with AAA or coupons.  The complimentary water can't be beat either.<//Review>

<Review>Had no problems at all. I was the only deposing passenger and the drive was great about taking the shortcut to terminal 7. Arriving back home, I missed the shuttle by 30 seconds, but luckily another one arrived about two minutes later. Can't complain about anything, really.<//Review></record>

< Review>
It's pricer than other parking lots but I wouldn't want to go cheap on a parking garage.  We have and we have paid with time and agony.  There's no question I would pay a little extra for the many shuttles they have and how they just streamline everything(dropping off, car wash even, and picking up)!

I don't go anywhere else and let the Spot take care and worry about parking.  I've learned from my mistakes and if you know ahead of time reserve your spot to save even more time and money.<//Review>

Good parking choice for LAX. Not the cheapest prices, but the shuttles run often, it appears to be quite safe, and you have options for covered or uncovered. Now they have status levels and more benefits for repeat customers, so they're starting to recognize customer loyalty< /review>

Almost impossible to get picked up on a Sunday night. I watched multiple Wallypark shuttles do by, but had to wait forever for a Parking Spot shuttle to bother to show up. Not a good value for the money.</Text>

I have used this company for the last time.  I have used them for years and collected alot of rewards. However when you go to redeem them look out.  I had horrible experience this morning.  Used Valet service and wanted to get the car washed after a quick Vegas trip.  Well needless to say I didnt get my car washed and I spent more time at this location then my flight time.  All because I used my points?  Forget it.  Im out.</Review>

Valet driver admitted he had trouble getting my car out of the spot. Almost a month has gone by and no one takes responsibility. DO NOT PARK HERE AS YOU RISK DAMAGE TO YOUR VEHICLE.  You would think the minor cost of repair would out weigh an angry customer.  Customer satisfaction is non existent here.  With all the competition near LAX there are better choices to keep your vehicle safe.< /Text>< pictures>

Plenty of shuttle services... no waiting which was really great! I made a reservation but there was no check in process so not sure why I was sent scan and check in emails. When checking out I had to tell cashier that I had AAA discount which was all entered when I made a reservation.. she still didn’t want to scan my reservation so not really sure it matters. I got my discount but it was a little frustrating.</text>

Have been parking here for more than 4 years when traveling via LAX. Witnessed the shuttle bus upgrades a few years back, and more recently the pickup spot change to upper level. Parking at LAX is not great and many off airport options exist.  The Parking Spot has two at Century and Sepulveda. They can sometimes fill up and during off hours you can wait for a shuttle bus pickup. The new Parking Spot app helps somewhat with bus location but GPS and data nearby major airports like LAX is spotty at best. Cost can be high at over 20 per night. Valet is only 1 dollar more per night typically. Free water is a nice touch. Wish the price was slightly lower and buses ran more frequently. Continuing legal conflicts with LAX will likely make future years interesting as parking situation changes and lawsuits go forward.<//Text>

I have used both Parking Spot locations, Century and Sepulveda, and have been very pleased with their customer service.  On a previous trip, I got on the Century bus instead of the Sepulveda bus and the driver took me to the Sepulveda location  after he dropped everyone off at the Century location.    On this last trip, I parked at Century, and I noted the driver was very helpful, courteous and kind to all passengers.  He picked up people even with a full bus instead of driving by them or having them wait for the next bus.  People were grateful to get on even if they had to stand on the bus for a few stops.< /review>

Pick ups are on the top level now, makes it easier to get picked up, but takes longer to get back to the parking garage.<//text>

My third row seat from my yukon was stolen while parked at this facility this week.  When reported to site manager, I was told "These things happen very frequently".  Very disappointed with the lack of support and interest in helping.  I understand that they are not responsible for lost or stolen items but I was hoping that at least they would show some interest to try to investigate in cameras.  I highly suspect this to be an inside job, who would be able to steal a whole sit from a truck and go unnoticed by "security" cameras?

I think that they have lost my business and possibly that of many people I know.</Text>

Off airport parking
Fairly expensive, but well run and efficient.  Shuttles run frequently, and are easy to catch especially since they moved to the departure level (top level).</text>

I travel a lot and nuse them alot. Next time I will use the sepulveda location as they have a van every couple minutes and this one has one every 5-10. Additionally, was driven by twice when trying to flag down a driver.< /text>

Shuttles should be picking you up every 5-7 minutes, so if you waited multiple intervals of 5-7 minutes to get on a shuttle, that's an issue.

Possibly the only one privately owned parking facility at LAX who does not pick up customers on the arrival level (lower level) at the courtesy tram stop.  Never even told me I needed to drag my luggage upstairs to departure level, otherwise I couldn't catch their  shuttle back to my vehicle.</review>

LAWA asked near-airport parking operators to pick-up upstairs during this construction period going on at LAX right now. We've posted in-shuttle signs and put messaging in our app about the change, but clearly that wasn't enough. We'll share your feedback with the management team in LA!"}< /Response>

Best option for parking at LAX. A little pricey and the driver's could be more helpful but the Parking Spot buses are always the fastest to pick up and the service at the parking garage is good.</review>

<review>The most expensive place to park your car. Plus wait an hour for a bus to come by when your flight arrives. I will never park my car here again. Plus parking lot help was not helpful.<//review>< pics>

Shuttles are scheduled for every 5-7 minutes, and whereas we know how congested the horseshoe at LAX can become, an hour delay is not reasonable, even if it was over Thanksgiving.

After applying and activating my card, I went online placed my reservation of departure and return date info, scanned my phone on arrival and parked and scanned my phone on my return and received a “Hugh” discount for pre-scheduled parking. I’ll be a customer for life!!👍🏾<//Text><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>The Parking Spot always exceeds my expectations. After parking somewhere else the first time and seeing the yellow shuttles with black dots passing by every 10 minutes, I never park anywhere else. My battery died this last trip and they were there to help jump start my truck.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2b6da0dfff2e1:0xb529433611b431fd<//gmap_id></record>

<text>So disappointing as I have been coming here for over 10 years and have never had such bad customer service - I never fly the red eye and this crew on the night shift ( for the exception of the shuttle driver)
Was horrible .

He Looked at my luggage and ran off to the next ... very disappointing as I usually have a good experience.<//text>< pics>

If you want to wait 45 minutes for a shuttle after a 6 hour flight, be my guest. These guys are as low rent as they come. Management can care less as long as the payment clears.< /text>
