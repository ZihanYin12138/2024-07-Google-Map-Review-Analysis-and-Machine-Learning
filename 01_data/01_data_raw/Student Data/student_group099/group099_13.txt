< Review>
First Jollibee in Bakersfield I think.

Went early since my lunch hour starts real early. Lucky for me they open at 9am.

This place has been open a bit over a week and the lines during the daytime are crazy long!

But I came just as they opened so I didn’t have any problems walking up ordered my food…got my food…sat and enjoyed my lunch.

I had the Two-Piece Burger Steak with white rice eand a diet soda. And it was delicious.

The restaurant was nice and clean.

The staff was friendly and very helpful!

I would recommend coming here!!!<//Review>

Their fried chicken is so crispy and tasty! The white rice is fluffy and fresh. The pineapple quencher it’s so refreshing and to top it off the peach mango pie is phenomenal. The spaghetti, adobo rice or cheese yumberger weren’t my favorite.<//review>

The manager is extremely slow moving, distracted and confused.

They didn’t even start my take out order until 6:15 that was supposedly ready for pick up at 6pm.

Manager said they were busy but restaurant wasn’t full. They simply neglect the online orders.</review>< time>

<review>First and foremost i loved my Jolly Spaghetti!!!!!
Was cooked to perfection. With that being said I have to say Mika the drive thru order taker was very friendly but have to say the one person who stood out the most was Maxine who was in charge of drive thru payments. She has such a cheerful attitude that if you are having a bad day she will do everything possible to make sure you leave Jollibee with a smile.   ☺< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>It's different but it's still fast food. Chicken had good flavor but the breading was a bit undercooked for my liking, spaghetti was sweet( some people probably like it but I did not) fries needed more time in the fryer. The rice was good with the gravy and was definitely different than most fast good places. It was a  nice  break from the traditional fast food but know it's still fast food< /Review>< Pics>

the chicken was crispy had flour after taste and mango pies pretty good.I guess I prefer real filipino food. They did not have all the items no spicy chicken no halo halo.Id comeback for the pies, not much else. I tried to really like maybe others have better experience.<//Text>

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
Asked for a plain cheeseburger for my grandson no veggies no sauce and we were told that they can't do special order's, WHAT is so special about leaving those out?? We waited 20 minutes which that wasn't bad but 20 minutes for warm fries one mashed potatoes,  2 cups of gravy. my grandson wouldn't eat the hamburger but I thought it was because of the mayo so I took a bite  and OMG the meat was disgusting no wonder my grandson wouldn't eat it. Will not go there again.</text>

Save your money. We went there today (7-16-2021) and found the chicken to be completely tasteless. Literally has no flavor at all. The brown sauce--that comes with it--is a stand-out at being brown, and lacks flavor. KFC or Popeye's is the real deal. I have no idea why people go crazy for Jollibee. The staff, however, are prompt, polite, and very nice.<//Review>

Check your food when you take it out, they give your food wrong. So disappointed on the service, try to call them 16 times already  and nobody  answer. I wish I can  give them 0 or negative  if I can do it....<//review>

The spaghetti is horrible it tasted like they warmed it up in the microwave and the wanna be cheese on top wasn't melted. The chicken was ok but I'd prefer Popeyes or KFC. Wasn't worth the money won't be going their again.< /Text>

Did not like it the chicken tasted like flour and was undercooked my daughter asked for no gravy on her mashed potatoes and they gave his gravy anyway and told us that they couldn't special order any food and my grandson wouldn't even eat his hamburger cuz it was so gross dissatisfied we didn't eat none of it but the pineapple drink was good</Text>

I had the Palabok Fiesta, The Burger Steak, Adobo Rice, and The 6 piece Chicken and a Yum with Cheese and two Mango Pies...
The Mango Pies were delicious but ever thing else was so disappointing😢

So glad have Jollibee in Bakersfield and pretty close to my home. I ordered burger steaks with rice and it was yummy. Palabok also taste good but I also ordered adobo rice and mashes potato and wasnt ready so i dont want to wait that long so end up having a french fries. I also want to order Halohalo but they dont serve till next month. The girl taking order was nice and also gave me a peach mango pie for free. So going back again soon.</text>

I am a pizza fanatic especially of the New York style and this is seriously good pizza. Especially after a long day of surfing!

Just came here again and it was phenomenal!! These guys are consistent!!!</text>

Some of the best pizza in all of Orange County, in the town of San Clemente. They make pizza into art and have great prices. Their large is huge!!! By the slice or you can get a whole pie. One of my favorite places to go when visiting the coast.
We met a new employee named Rich, he couldn't have been better. Great customer service and friendly to talk to.
I highly recommend this restaurant!!!<//Text>

Best pizza in SC no question! Slices are a little pricey at $4 but it's right at the top of Del Mar 🤷‍♂️💸</Review>

<text>Moved to San Clemente 6 months ago after a decade in NYC and have been homesick for huge, floppy, foldable thin crust pizza ever since...this place hits the spot! We called in the order and got takeout so can’t comment on the service, but if they were mean to me my shriveled black New York heart would burst with joy and I’d put them up to 5 stars for authenticity. Their pizza is great, this place may have cured my depression.</text>< Pics>

After trying several pizza places in SoCal, this one is by far the closest to a NY style slice. Cheese slice was pretty standard what you find in Manhattan, and specialty slices were good with fresh ingredients. Would have liked to see a thin crust Margherita with fresh mozzarella, but otherwise the selection is great. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Pictured is the supreme option with no peppers. It was very very good. This is one of the best spots in SoCal to compare to nyc pizza. We are always on the look out for anything comparable. The fact they sell pizza by the slice is always a good sign too :)</Review>

Their cornmeal crust is amazing.  It is a great date place because it has comfort food with cozy decor and a friendly crowd.  I was raised on Zachary's, but occasionally enjoy cheating with LaRocco's Pizzeria< /review>

I love the thin crust but NY pizza isn't this thin. This is more like a cracker crust. One size only. $18 to $25. Big slices @$4 a slice or 2 for $8.50.< /text>

The calzones are second to none. The garlic bites are the finest little buttered up carb bites drowned in butter and doused in a delightful parmigiana< /text>

<Name>Julie Miller<//Name><text>Drove from North County, it is my husbands favorite pizza place for many years. We walked in at 11:30am, we ask to order a pizza. The girl working told my family there was going to be no pizza ready for 45 minutes. I told her we drove all the way from Irvine. She didn’t seem to care, she repeated 45 minutes for pizza. We walk out. We will never go back. Why open the restaurant at 11am if you get get a pizza till 12:15pm. I will also contact management. Very disappointed.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I would order a pizza but their own website redirects me to other pizza companies websites... are they trying to tell me their pizza is bad and I would be better of ordering domino's? Because that's where the website wants me to go.< /review>

Best pizza I’ve had in Southern California hands down. The crust was perfectly crispy. The selection of toppings were ample, but nothing fancy — just what a pizza should be. Coming back for seconds very soon.<//Text>

so glad I live in a neighborhood where I can walk down the block or two or three or four... okay less than a dozen...and get some great fresh delicious slices of New York (style meaning not in New York) pizza-pie!

makes life so much easier no?

btw friendly kitchen and wait staff</review>

I lived in Manhattan for 10 years. This is as good as it gets in SoCal and for sure in San Clemente. The crust and style of the pizza, incl. the funky combinations is no different than any other corner joint in the city. Thanks for bringing a slice of the Big Apple to the beach. Be good Team LaRocco <3< /text>

<Text>The BEST  thin crust pizza in southern California hands down. The location is low key but the pizza speaks for itself. The dedication and hard work of the owners and workers is evident in the taste and service</Text>< time>

The pizza there is the best i can get in OC. As a SoCal transplant originally hailing from NJ, this is the only pizza I get. That being said, the customer service at this place is HORRENDOUS. They aren’t polite or friendly, seem catatonic/sort of like they’re all on heroin, often screw up orders, and don’t know the menu, but at least the cooks know what they’re doing!</Text>

Ordered a slice of their combo. Put in the oven for about 2 minutes. Recieved it and it was barely warm. It was extremely thin pizza. Which I dont mind, but it needs some crispness to it. This was paper thin, and lukewarm. Pizzas looked as though they had been in the case for a few hours. The look was not winning any awards. Overall it was ok. Probably wouldn't go back.</Text>

I have been coming to La Rocco's for several years and I have never had a bad experience! Delicious and fresh pizza for fair price! Always quick and great service. The staff is always great and very helpful especially Stephanie is has been one of my favorite workers over the years! I definitely recommend trying the South Jersey or Puttanesca, Pauley's special. Everything is great here!</review>

<text>On a good day Laroccos has good to excellent quality authentic New York style pizza. The only problem in quality control does not seem to come from the ingredients, equipment or the building so much as it does from the professionalism of the employees. I get the distinct impression oftentimes that they are there to do the absolute minimum necessary to maintain a paycheck and not be fired. My guess is that the employees are paid at a bare minimum and neither have the leadership or the financial incentive to give anything near a hundred percent.
I have been in there dozens upon dozens of times and have no clue who the manager is or who runs the restaurant. For someone who frequents larocco's as often as I do this strikes me as a little bit odd from a mom and pop style Pizzeria.
This indicates to me that the ownership has likely become very distant in their involvement in the daily operations and as a consequence Laroccos lacks the distinct personality of a family-run pizzeria.
While I certainly do not require a fat Italian with a mustache named Mario running the joint, they should have someone who is involved and who clearly cares about the customers experience above all other issues. It is intrinsic to this kind of restaurant and completely lacking.
Maybe larocco's can exist purely on its laurels but in such a state they are in my opinion much more close to losing critical mass of business then they realise. I would encourage the ownership to invest more in their employees and attempt to make larocco's the kind of place that is a desirable job rather than something for kids to satiate their parents with basic employment
To be clear this is not at all and indictment of the employees who work there. That would be like blaming a janitor for a shuttle blowing up at NASA. It is completely unreasonable to expect a wet behind the ears high school students to bring the atmosphere an experienced manager who's personally invested in the business and who has the knowledge required to consistently bring an A game on a daily basis.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcf46e58d7ab0b:0x20e7bd20adc6c802< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Sad to say but this place has gone down the drain.I use to love it but with the last experience I had I doubt I will ever go back again and I've been a San Clemente local for 50 years.The pizza making so-called manager is rude.DUDE I only took a bite of a crappy slice of pizza and asked to change to another slice but No I had to toss it in the trash and take a loss.Guess what, you took a bigger loss and lost a regular customer and also many orders that will not be picked up at your boss expense.Will be nice to get the slices for free at Oles LOL BTW, Pizza sitting that long in a case with fly's lurking might be bad for business.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

No management. Ordered a pizza for pickup and now I am waiting on line for 15 minutes while they take order slices. Worst organization ever. I have watched 20 people walk away. I am only staying because my pizza is free.< /Text>

<text>Oh. My. God. Let me tell you a little something about LaRocco's Pizzeria, it is literally THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!
Personally, I love thin crust pizza, so as soon as I took a bite into that cheese pizza, I knew that I'd never find anything like it. I also LOVEEE the garlic knotts! Carb heaven up there! I have been going the pizza joint since I was a little girl and I have never gotten sick/tired of this pizza, I could eat it for weeks!
The staff is so sweet and kind, they really do care about their customers. One time I was ordering 2 slices of cheese pizza and a soft drink and the cash register broke. One of the guys I knew was working there and he was trying to fix it for about 10 minutes. All I had was a 20 so he ended up letting me have the food and drink for free. This was so sweet! I will never forget the day that happened!
It's a very casual and family friendly joint. There's some seating in the front of the resturaunt, but most is is in the back. I normally go to the back because the front is filled up.
Overall, I would recommend no place more than LaRoccos to get your New York Style Pizza.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcf46e58d7ab0b:0x20e7bd20adc6c802<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My little sister loves it here. The teachers are nice and the place is huge! What is cool about this place is that the gymnastics teachers seem to be at this place for a long time. Some of the places we go for gymnastics usually they have a new teacher every time they learn so sometimes they don’t know what certain kids have to work on or not.<//text>

Coach Wes was very communicative and helpful with ideas for progressing and practice at home.  He sent weekly emails with feedback about class and videos for my daughter to watch.  He has an impressive background for coaching and it shows.  My daughter really liked him and learned quickly.  I like their policies and the positive atmosphere.  They also have a great viewing area for parents.<//Text>< Pictures>

I think that this gymnastics place is the BEST gymnastics place ever! I think this because it’s fun, exciting  and just super AWESOME! It’s fun because you get to do bunjes, trampoline, and you get to jump into the foam pit. The next reason that this is awesome because it’s exiting. For instance, you always get to do new things like back handsprings, and back and frount flips. The last reason why this place is the best place ever  because it’s just super, duper, duper, duper AWESOME.</Review>

<text>I moved my daughter over from the YMCA in Dec 2015 to join their competition team as a level 3 where she was very successful moving up the ranks with quality no nonsense instruction.  The Rec coaches are top notch but with any business I've seen changes the last year that's more focused on profit.  As a parent and an observer I would always recommend checking out other gyms before getting into a contract< /text>< Pictures>

I think that this gymmnastics place is the best gymnastics place ever! I am 10 years old and I started when I was 8 and I didn’t know how to do a handstand! Now I am good at cartwheels, handstands, and the bars. I am also going to learn a back hand spring! It is SOOOOOO fun.<//Review>

<Text>Both of my sons have been attending Gyminny Kids classes and camps for about a year, and we could not be happier! The staff and coaches are extremely helpful, and my boys just adore Mr. David. He is so kind, patient, and encouraging.  He always takes the time to give us a quick update after class, and I just love that. Being a part of this program has really given my son a lot of self confidence. Love this place!< /Text><resp>None</resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< user>

< review>
Worst experience ever in 10 years working with a gym studio. This place is a complete racket~all they want is money. Let me preface that I have been very patient. I never leave a unflattering review unless it's warranted. My daughter has been at 3 different gyms in the last 10 years~SCATS, Eastside Gym and Mount SI gym and the lack of communication and coaches engagement at NCG is ridiculous. Not only do they not have enough classes available for their xcel prgram for the girls to succeed, but they still charge you for competitions when your girls don't go. For example, They just charged us $300 for a regionals competition in addition to the  approx $2400 in Xcel costs plus approx $300+ for monthly gym classes for absolutely no reason. Our daughter got a 34.70 in State and qualified, yet Coach Nathan decided she shouldn't go to regionals and regardless charged us the fee. It wasn't only her, also her best friend qualified at 34.025 and he wouldn't take her.

FYI- gold xcel qualifying is 34 for her age bracket.

What coach doesn’t take their girls( when others  are going anyway) when they qualify?  What does this teach them? Even if you are good enough, you should do better? Ridiculous. It’s hard enough in this fast moving and competitive day and age to feel your worth, let alone when you do what is expected to be told you aren’t good enough and can’t proceed. Why even compete or try?

WAY TO CRUSH YOUNG GIRLS SPIRTS and RUIN the last meets of the year NCG and Coach Nathan. In all my years (10) of coaches, never-ever-ever have I experienced worst customer service or lack of sensitivity to the gymnasts feelings. And Coach Nathan doesn't even stick around or talk with any parents. At least not in the last 3 gym meets I have been. Yes, I am upset. Mostly for my daughter who wanted the last year of xcel to be memorable. Now I am just mopping up their mess.<//review>

<text>Our family loves Gyminny Kids.  We joined about 1 year ago.  We were referred by Ronna.

Staff:  All staff members, especially Ronna, are super sweet and friendly.  They always greet my kids.  My daughter had Ms. Larissa and now has Mr. Earl.  She likes both teachers and I do too.  They are great with the kids.  My 4 year old daughter loves Gyminny Kids so much that she requested to have her 4th birthday party here last month in September.  Ronna kindly helped us with setting the arrangement up. The staff at the birthday party was great! We picked the princess theme.  Staff members that assisted us dressed up as princess/prince characters.  They decorated the room with table cloth, disney princess plates, disney princess center pieces, disney princess cups, and disney princess tiara.  They allowed me to bring my own decorations and cake as well.  I did bring some food too for the guest.  The party was 1 1/2 hours which I felt was perfect.  Parents enjoyed the birthday party because they had 1 hour to sit and enjoy other adults while watching their kids have fun with the staff.  Everything was executed well from greeting all guest at the birthday, getting the gifts, giving them name tags, putting them in groups, doing the activity for 1 hour, then leading the kids to the party room, and then leading them down to the front entrance once it was done.

Parking: there are plenty of spots in the parking lot.

Fee: it's pretty reasonable for the amount of fun my daughter has.

Environment/activities: they do so many activities that really allow the child to be engaged.  It assist with development and gross motor skills as well. The facility is big with a lot of equipment.  Staff members assist throughout the whole time in their class.  They have different themes every week where staff members dress up.  The facility is pretty clean and opened.  There are a lot of seats for the parent to watch the kids from the second floor deck.

I highly recommend this place.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dbf72033868da9:0x7a61ea226a007af0< /Gmap_id>< username>

<Text>I love this permanent Farmer's Market in my area! My goodness, the fruit was gorgeous, and the vegetables were fresh as well.  All the products that can be found in this market were very fresh. The food stall was a massive one. Especially the salad bar. It was very convenient to visit this place as well. Thumbs up!<//Text>< UserId.>

Sprouts has come a long way since the first time I entered one.

We finally went to the sprouts here in Ventura, the store is clean bright with lots of fresh food and a friendly helpful staff.
We like the fact that they always have fresh food, especially fish and the meat dept.
They have excellent sausages and they make are huge and the make some cool burger patties like feta cheddar turkey burger and a jalapeño cheddar burger patties.

They have wild caught Salmon and not just one piece which seems to be the norm at all the other stores around here which is weird since we are right on the ocean!

The fresh fruit and veggies are on point and take up like half the store. They have a great dry goods section of nuts, fruit and trail mix.

We got a couple of sandwiches from the deli and they were stacked with meat and veggies for like 5 bucks.

The new first stop is sprouts for us. Its whats for dinner.< /text>

Great customer service in that they will hold a product for me so that it is in stock when I arrive. They have a good selection of the organic products I buy. I like their free range, unseasoned rotisserie chicken. It is fresh and juicy and not loaded down with sodium, MSG, antibiotics, hormones or chemicals. Their organic chicken breasts are fresh, plump and juicy and worth the price.<//Review>

I love this grocery store because they are open earlier than others. They have a great selection of their goods, fresh produce, and meats. Their prices also were very more affordable compared to others that I went to before. The staff is nice too and I find it relaxing doing my groceries here compared to other grocery stores. Highly recommended!<//text>

Sprouts is a great grocery chain for your specialty items and items that are on the healthier side. Prices are slightly more, but the quality speaks for itself. The staff and their friendliness just adds to a great shopping experience.</Review>

Very helpful and kind. I did curbside pickup. My online order was ready ahead of time. There were some substitutions, and they checked with me to make sure they were acceptable. They also do a follow up survey. A nice experience.</review>

This store has been a life saver ever since I left rehab, I have been taking care of myself and monitoring my food intake. This store is a ten minute walk from my house and their supplement section id off the chain.  Their organic veggies and fresh fruit are top notch.<//Review>

I love their bulk section and more thoughtful selection of brands. They recycle sheet plastics so that helps me feel better about the bags in the bulk section. Produce is hit and miss. Some really good items but got broccoli with bugs twice several years apart.</review>

High prices, shop the sales. Their produce is good quality and meats are hit or miss on prices but always good quality. Their frozen section is a NIGHTMARE. I never know the prices since the tags are super small & don't line up to the items. Their vitamin section is good and there are some pretty knowledgeable people in the department and some who could care less.
Checking out I always avoid the young blonde guy. He's been extremely rude like I was inconvencing him by asking him not to sling the meat and berries to the bagging area. The older lady at the first check stand is always sweet. I'll stand in her lane even if the line is longer.</Text>

<Review>I love shopping here all the staff is very friendly and helpful and the store doesn't smell nasty like other grocery stores. I would have to say there greatest thing about this store is the meat department the guys know there cuts and what to make if you can't figure it out . John in the meat department has saved me a had full of times showed the wonderful one pan meals. Gave me a great recipe for the spinach feta sausage the whole crew is great definitely a good team there . From the bagger cashier any department this store is great and the folks very helpful .< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The actual store has a good selection of products and the bulk section is so great. However the cashiers at this Sprouts need to be let go or get better training. They should take a page from Trader Joe’s book. No one even comes comes close to their high quality customer service and that is why Trader Joe’s is my go-to.< /Review>< pics>

I don’t usually shop here but I was in the area and needed a couple things so I went in. I purchased my items and they bagged them for me... forgetting to bag one of my items. I call the store to see if they can remedy this situation and all they can offer is for me to come in and get a refund or come in and get my items. Well I’m sorry but that’s not good enough. It was 100% their mistake and now my baby is screaming and I have no time to go in. I guess I’ll get my $2.99 refund next time I’m in the area. Thanks for nothing.<//Review>

This store customer service is amazing! I am a fairly new professional shopper and learning Sprouts lay out and products. When ever I need help EVERYONE in this store is happy and willing to help, including taking the time to go outback to check for stock. This is so important because as a team we are helping fullfill  online orders.  I don't know everyone names but two people who I would like to give a shout out to is Alex and James. These guys are always positive, professional and unbelievably helpful. Thank you Sprouts Ventura team for working with me as a team to keep our online shoppers happy and loyal customers. By completing these orders as efficient as possible, as a team,  is so unbelievably important and I can count on this store to be a team player.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The store itself is ok but do not, and I mean DO NOT buy a sandwich from this place. There is an old white man who makes sandwiches and he is terrible! He  made one sandwich in the time it took another woman to make five! Then the sandwich doesn't even come out right. The guy is nice but he really shouldnt be making people's lunches.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Food choices are great and prices are too. The meat counter is awesome here. Everything is good and the guys behind the counter are super friendly. Sometimes the choices can be a bit limited, but usually they'll have everything you want.</Review>

I can deal with the common occurrence of items constantly being out of stock but what I cannot deal with is the blantent rudeness of the employees. Upon asking a male employee if he could check if they had a particular item in the  back 2.5 hours before the store is scheduled to close, I asked an employee if he could check if a particular creamer was in stock (said creamer has been out of stock in the store for the past four times I’ve visited no matter what day/time I’ve gone) to which He reluctantly responded with “I don’t know it’s pretty late now but fine”.... too late?.. Before leaving to check out the items They did have in stock I unwillingly heard an entire conversation of other employees in uniforms congregating by the beer discussing their ipa and stout preferences, etc.. maybe their time would have been better spent helping out other customers.. or their disgruntled coworkers who also have no interest in helping a mother with her baby. On another occurrence, a middle aged female grocery checker had an open and audible conversation with the bag checker regarding their displeasure about how “people shouldn’t be doing their grocery shopping so late and how it isn’t fair that they still have to be working right now). If you’re store is open and this is your shift, then yes, expect to have customers purchasing items... speaking poorly of customers while they’re right in front of you is a rudimentary concept of what NOT to do. Upon reading other reviews, it seems as though customer service is a common issue at this location. In a previous review, on man brought up in a how he believes many of the employees have been discriminating against customers based on race.  I too am a woman of color and I am now considering this to be a possibility which is why I will no longer be supporting this store.< /Text>< Date>

Love the store but the front end needs work. The cashiers have absolutely no sense of urgency. They never take the NEXT CUSTOMER IN LINE! I was in line tonight and the line was long. A second cashier came to help and instead of taking me the next in line, with only 4 things stuck & behind a huge order she takes the customer with another huge cart behind me. To add salt to the wound the lady go checked out before i did!! Didn't catch the lady's name because her badge was flipped over so the name couldn't be seen. Teal shirt, dark brown hair with a nose piercing.<//text>

Just checked out the new store and I really enjoyed it! The selection is great (much better than Trader Joe's). There are so many areas with a great selection, I'll just name my highlights. Asian section: lots of sauces, pastes, noodle and rice variety. Veggies: many less common veggies available. Particularly chilis. They dont have every chili I could want, but having more than just jalapeños is a start! Meat section is much bigger than Trader Joe's. The prices looked pretty reasonable - although I haven't done a trip yet for my weekly groceries.  The layout of the store is very open, which makes it easy to find things as well as being inviting. I hate stores that have teeny tiny aisles and induce claustrophobia...(Trader Joe's) The store was staffed very well for their second day of business. Everyone working there was super nice and seemed to have such a positive attitude. Like they were excited to be there. I had such a great experience - I hope my weekly trip is a reasonable price because I like the store a lot!</text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>1<//rating><Text>ATTENTION!. This place is a beautiful place, but VERy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!×10 RACIST. I'm a young "white" man who's a Dr Married to a beautiful woman of color. While I happened to be in the vitamins department I watched my wife from afar and saw that, she was not welcomed nor did anyone ask her if she needed anything.  But I observed that whenever a white person walked in they were praised. Until check out this was where I had it. She was just about to be rang, but a short blond elder lady came, and asked her to live the line and asked her to check out where a young girl of color her name is Tai, who also happened to be the casher... Then I saw them all laugh at her my "wife" as she walked away. I was angry, so then I went were my wife was checking out before she was redirected, and the lady said "WELCOME" and checked me out. Wow!!!!.. and so I decided to take this to a higher authority. So people reading this, it's no joke.. people of color are not all bad just like us. When you see this happen speak up.... SHAME ON YOU SPROUTS!!< /Text>< Date>

< Review>
Not exactly local produce, I asked the produce clerk if the produce came locally and he said it comes from inside the US which is great but with Ventura being so rich in agriculture you'd think they'd bring in local FARM FRESH produce.  It would be great if they could bring in local goods like Whole Foods does. Can you guys change your music?  The music is the worst, they play the 'latest hits' and who listens to that garbage but my kids, haha. Anyways how about some old school music like The Beatles or The Clash. Trader Joes ALWAYS has the best tunes, please tune on to whatever channel they are on! There is still some room for improvement Sprouts!  Overall its a beautiful store with good foods and fair prices plus happy people working there. There are a few snooty teenagers that work there but that could  have been employees from other stores that came into this store to help for opening week. Sprouts change your music and bring in local!</Review>

My husband and I recently went to the Sprouts store @ 4870 Telephone Rd. Ventura, CA 93003 to purchase some salad dressings and Hemp Milk.They're a little pricey, but they have great products that we have not been able to find elsewhere. However, this was a horrible experience.......

My husband and I checked out at the register that Manager: Konnie was working at. Everything was seemingly fine at first. We asked her to split the bill between two cards and she said it was fine. When she ran the first card, she looked up and said, "Oh, it ran the whole amount. Well, I pressed $8.50. Have a good night, goodbye." And continued to greet the next customer. My husband then said "Excuse me....you didn't apologize or offer to fix it or anything...I find that quite rude." To which she replied in an exhausted manner, "I can refund it if you want and recharge...". My husband then brought up the point that she didn't even apologize or anything..just sort of brushed it off. We asked to speak with her manager. She replied, "I am the manager." We asked where we could make a complaint. She replied" Excuse me, I am manning the register. I will not be rude to my customer." Then proceeded to ignore us as she greeted the next person in line with a huge smile. I said "But...WE are customers as well..." She continued to ignore us. We then asked a young man close by if there was a manager we could speak to.....he pointed at Konnie. I then walked towards the vitamin section of the store, vocally asking for a manager for help.

On top of that...As I walked towards the exit...I heard Konnie talking about my husband and I to other customers she was checking out, and then she said "Can you imagine how I FEEL right now?", laughing.  While a (what I think was) a security guard (older gentleman) followed me out.

I just couldn't believe it. And after all of that, I emailed the district manager of the company, Brett D'Amico. This was his reply: "Thank you Tara for your email. I have followed up with our team and appropriate protocol in situations to ensure customers are taken care of.

Brett"

No apology.....no real solution....not really a clear answer.</text>

My wife and I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere but my grand daughter was not as impressed. This is a great place to go for couples.< /review>

I walked in Calavera and the atmosphere of the restaurant had a wonderful Mexican rustic feel. The Cadillac margarita was on point. The chilaquiles

<rate>4< /rate><review>Came with a group of people from work, so we got to share and try different dishes. Loved everything! The salad with nopales (cactus), various greens, heirloom tomatoes and pumpkin seeds had a very good dressing, and everything tasted fresh. I've oredered their soup, caldo tlalapeno (sp?), which was hearty and full of chunky veggies, rice, lots of chicken, and had a generous slice of avocado.  It also had two dried chiles that I've fished out since I can't do very spicy, but the soup still had a good kick to it thanks to chile flakes and whatever else they put in the to spice it up. Their tacos with deep fried squash were a hit as well, and were a vegetarian version of the fish tacos (those came with deep fried cod).  Everything was fresh and the flavors and presentation made for an enjoyable meal.

Came in for quick bite chicken tacos, rice & beans. Food was very fresh, hot & flavorful. Restaurant staff was patient, helpful and considerate. Offered chips & salsa too. Highly recommend this diamond in the rough.< /Review>

Located on mission and 16th. I ordered a churro and a carne asada super burrito. And when you check in there on yelp you get $2 off a super burrito.  The salsa bar is top notch with a variety of spiciness levels and unique flavors. I enjoyed the churro while I waited for my meal. It was cinnamon crunchy delight. The super burrito was tasty. Overall good food and great service.<//Text>

This restaurant is the one I always prefer. I eat in plenty of restaurants but to this place I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very chummy and the cooking they cook is so fresh and tasty. I am always happy to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.</Review>

< Review>
Stumbled upon Ten-Ichi this weekend with my friend, as we were strolling on Upper Fillmore, and I was CRAVING Japanese food. Turns out Ten-Ichi is Family owned and has been in business since the late 70's! We sat outside, they turned on a heat lamp for us, and we had a YUMMY meal of Miso soup, Sushi, Sashimi, Salmon Teriyaki (so good) and Tempura stuffed mushrooms (YUM). Reasonable pricing, good food, and good service. We will be back for sure.</Review>

I sat down at their bar within 5-10 minutes and I was on my way 20 minutes after that! The quality of the fish was great and the flavors were great. It is suggested to eat the hand roll immediately after being served so you can crunch down on the seaweed, it really makes a difference! It is still fairly pricey though.< /Review>< pictures>

We enjoy to go out. Yesterday we arrived in this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We passed a beautiful experience there with first-rate cooking and a well-trained stuff and  a professional chief cook. We  added this venue in our list  and we shall definitely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.< /Review>

<text>It was good, however nothing special about the handrolls. It's just like any other sushi spot. You can probably get tastier ones at your favorite spot with siracha & other sauce sides. They only offer soy sauce.  I personally won't be going back to downtown for this restaurant.</text>< Pics>

Delicious and quick. The fish was fresh, the prices reasonable, and it tasted pretty damn good. But you knew all this already because of the bazillion other good reviews.</text>

Hands down this place gets down w their rolls. U can pick and choose from the many type of fish they have. Not going to lie at first I was kinda picky cuz they are just wraps but in reality they pack a wallop. I will recommend to go as soon as they open since it's just a bar and it's very popular.. two thumbs up<//text>

Ten-Ichi Restaurant & Sushi Bar  is and will forever be my favorite place to eat haha. Still five stars BUT I'd like to thank the workers here for their good service :) I love the iced tea here & a worker offered to pack me two to go cups of iced tea so I can enjoy some while walking around LA! And the paper straws were a nice touch haha. Thank you for the always amazing meal Ten-Ichi Restaurant & Sushi Bar< /review>

Our food was good but in a city with so much sushi, it did not stand out. The service was also okay, but our waiter wasn’t the most attentive. They did help celebrate my gf birthday by bringing a plate with sorbet and some strawberry’s which was nice, overall a good but not fantastic dining experience.</Text>

I've dined here many times because I live in the neighborhood. I so want to love this place because of the history and proximity, but the food quality is just not good and it's gotten worse each time. I'm Japanese and when I'm too lazy to go far or cook myself, I come here to seek comfort. Fish is not fresh. One time there was plastic wrap in my sushi. Today the udon was horrible, the outside mushy and falling apart while the inside was undercooked and chalky. The broth was palatable because it's probably a solid factory made concentrate. Tempura batter was overworked and chewy. It just seems like staff in the kitchen just don't care and have no clue what good Japanese food is supposed to taste like. The servers are kind and hard-working, but because they are understaffed, presumably due to decreased business, the service is slow and patchy. Fingers crossed that this place gets the right help it needs to update its menu and improve processes to get it right.</text>

<Review>the service was terrible. One person's meal was served more than 10 minutes after the first person's meal was served. We canceled an appetizer order when it was not delivered before the meals were provided. The food is below average and the price is above average. another sushi restaurant at 706 Sutter where the sushi is much better.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808580c6143367cd:0x6caa4a3e2a5d27ad<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The decor is a bit outdated. We dined here for a date night dinner after work. They have a simple but tasty menu that you'd expect to find: the typical rolls and nigiri pieces that you would normally find at a Japanese/sushi restaurant. I think we felt that it was too expensive for what we ordered...but, then again it filled our need for sushi. And, it was low-key, which is sometimes what you need in a sushi place.<//text>

Manager came to the table and basically yelled at us for expecting sushi dinners before one hour, which he stated was typical for a Sunday at 5:30. Totally awful place which is too bad b/c it is near the wonderful Clay Cinema on Fillmore.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Tenichi has been my 'go-to' sushi spot in SF since I was young. I've always thought that it was pretty good, but they've made little changes to their menu to add some more creative items that are actually really good.

On top of that, I had a bit of an omakase situation there from the younger dude working there. (For those of you unfamiliar with Omakase, that's when you let the sushi chef do his thing...) It was also on point. More than just a standard sushi place when you let them do their thing.

Other than that, their fish is super fresh, and that's really the most important thing at the end of the day, but the standard stuff on the menu is just that.. pretty standard. Good, but standard.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Very bad japanese food. Since on fillmore, prices high, but I wouldn't eat here for free. Restaurant being empty should have been a clue.  Beef teriyaki was jerky-like and tuna was old. Definitely walk to japantown where at least the food is edible (but not great).< /review>< resp>

I like coming into this store.  They have work clothes, jackets, cowboy hats, boots, rain boots, shoes, vests, gloves.  Nice place to shop for gifts.  At times they have "live" chicks.  They also have feed for farm animals, dog/cat food, they even have medicine you can administer to your farm animal.  There are pumps, sheds, coops, benches, fencing, tools, propane tanks, tents, barbecues.  They also offer "free" pet clinics where you can get your pets examined & shots updated, just look for dates they usually post it and you can go to their website for further information and check out the sales & clearances.< /review>

Stores are clean & well organized.  All of their stores are laid out the same so it's easy to find what you're looking for & I especially appreciate that all of the stores are open until 9:00pm. I buy all of my animal products there because they have a good selection of quality products at reasonable prices.< /review>

<text>It has an excellent staff and customer service people willing to help you with whatever and they don't look at you crazy when you tell them your looking for a whatcha call it ,they really know what. It is great service ,it's a little pricey but it beats Walmart personnel by a long shot great work guys</text>< pics>

I Bought a pair of Justin Workboots and this was just a waste of my money because i was using this on a regular everyday work and in only 65 days the leather of the boots were already ripped apart for itself and i emailed tractor supply and they didn't help me with any warranty nor anything... They said they can't do nothing because the Justin Boots Company Warranties that their boots came free from defects and blah blah...<//text>

Apparently having tattoos automatically makes you a thief. I have not so much as taken a single stick of gum from that place without paying for it but I walk in the store with my tattoos showing and two staff members immediately followed me around to everywhere that I went and even blocked the door when I walked up to look at the racks in the front of the store. I will be doing my shopping at another location from now on.</review>

Reasonable prices on most items. Short on clothing selection.  Great variety of dog, cat, and chicken feefs and supplies.  Check out their nuts and bolts by the pound.  Very friendly staff, always willing to help,<//review>

I was looking for paint and none of the sale clerks ask me if I needed help . I finally ask the sale clerk at the cash register .
At Ace Hardware the clerks ask you and are always very helpful.  🤔</text>

I really enjoy wandering around in this store they have a little of everything from clothes to livestock feed outside decor and just about everything in between. They are a little pricey on some things for my budget tho.< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I was looking for a swimming pool for my children and there was no store, when I came to a tractor they showed me resistant plastic tubs of different sizes so I chose one and my children loved it.

<Text>By far the worst T-Mobile store there is.  They are really good at selling phones and services but horrible in every other aspect.  I waited outside 20 minutes while the employees inside talked and hung out.  The woman at the table before you walk in makes sure no one walks in there without her giving the okay.  So of course, myself and the two other customers waited for her to finish with the ones she was helping.
She said my name was on the list and at one point, the woman in the store called me while I was standing there.

***This is a case of the blind leading the blind.

After waiting 20 minutes, Geo the assistant manager comes out to tell me they only have one replacement screen for both my phones and that I would have to put it on myself.

Note:  I called t-mobile customer service prior to showing up at this location.  They said the people in the store would install the new screen protectors for me as my insurance policy covers this service.

They were quick to sell me the latest and greatest phones, but horrible at replacing or providing customer service.   Hopefully someone shows up to provide customer service training to these people as they lack basic service skills.</Text>< Pics>

I wanted to leave Verizon so I gave T-Mobile prepaid a chance.  I wanted to test T-Mobile service before signing up for a plan.  Sadly, 2 days after attempting to port my number, it has not happened.  It’s in limbo somewhere.  I went back to this store to cancel the porting and hopefully get a refund.  The person who helped me immediately said “for prepaid you will not get a refund”. That’s $25 lost for no number ported.  Now I have to contact Verizon to see if can salvage my number.  If I could rate T-Mobile customer service lower than one star, I would.< /review>

I have been a loyal member of sprint for over ten years. I recently just switched from android to apple via telephone. I went to my local sprint store to get assistance in switching my date from my note 10 to my iphone 11. They told me they werent doing data transfers at the moment. How is that an acceptable answer from a major company to help me get my phone in working condition to be able to use it?< /text>

Terrible terrible terrible. If I could give this place zero stars I would ! I arrived to T-Mobile around 6:45pm and waited in line patiently. The T-Mobile associate came up to me and asked what I needed. I explained to her that i was trying to purchase an IPAD. She grabbed her iPad and started asking me for my name and number. She then said she would call me when it was my turn in line. She asked if I drove and I said yes. She asked me if I could wait in my car, so I agreed because it was cold. I waited an hour and 20 minutes. They never called me. I then look outside and they are closing up the store. What a disappointment. I will never come back to this store, it was my first and last time coming here. Complete waste  of time.<//Review>

I never write bad reviews, but every time I go there it’s just a bad experience for me. Some of the staff is rude including the manager. I get that there cannot be no more than 10 people at the store but I don’t see the point of making an appointment if we have to wait 40 minutes outside to see a representative.
Also, the girl that helped us seemed to be annoyed at us, and we went to another t-mobile so they gave us a different opinion and actually helped us activate our phone. Things are disorganized in this store.< /Text>

Went into the Lemon Groove TMobile shopping for a new service. I was helped by Lizette and her professionalism, knowledge, and friendly demeanor made it apparent which provider I should go with. Good Bye AT&T- Hello TMobile, I walked out with a smile on face. I recommend visiting Lizette at this store to anyone looking for a new provider.</Text>

<Review>I cannot get a good signal at my house and so I was looking for a signal booster. After visiting one store and calling the 611 customer service number, I was told to visit a store, because they were back ordered until October 21. ( not a good sign). I called the Lemon Grove store to avoid driving to a store with no booster and was told on the phone they had one. Upon arriving, I was 6th in line for assistance and when called to the counter was told they did not have one. The suggestion was to use the internet instead because you get a better signal anyway. Really? I should have a T-Mobile account to connect to the internet to make my phone calls? Now that is a company endorsement.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Each time I came here customer service has always been great and very helpful you get what you need. No issues here.

UPDATE:
Since the owner is questioning my review on " why not 5 stars", which I personally dont think you should be questioning customer on their rating review, just lost a star..</Review>

<review>Andres A. was a really cool dude and despite him really not being able to do much for me due to the limited functions he had available to him he still went above and beyond and out of his way to do his best to get my services restored. Thank you Andres A.< /review>< Pics>

We sat for 15 minutes before we went up to an employee and asked for help and he said we would be next, and then he disappeared into the back room for 10 minutes before we decided f this and left. Very terrible customer service.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>It was very frustraiting to find out that I never got my id back (thought I lost it somewhere a month or two ago) then to be called and told if I don't come and get it that day it would be shredded! (If you guys had called me sooner i would have come back sooner) then i get there and no one knows where it is so I have to come back then I go back and am told thats its not there.. It wasn't until I said that i record all of my phone conversations and could proove that i was called and told it was there that the guy would even go back and look for it.. He wound up finding it but look what i had to go through its a bit ridiculous..<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Charls helped me with his big smile and friendly attitude. All I needed was transferring my old phone information to a new phone which T-Mobil store in Mira Mesa rejected me and didn't want to do it.once more I should Thank Charls....< /text>

I would think twice before visiting this store. T-Mobile had a replacement phone sent to this location to make it convienent for me. I called a day after the order was placed and was told it didn't arrive. I called today, again,and was told no phone was received. So I called TMobile customer service back. They verified the phone was received by someone at this store. The operator had to track down the person who actually received the phone, which by the way was at 10am prior to my first call to the store. What wasn't noted in my account or anywhere regarding on the replacement phone itself, was that it was sent back due to a cracked screen. I only know this because the operator had to press for information because she also had been told,"they didn't have the phone"
<br>
<br>It would've taken one sentence -Returned to Sender Due to Cracked Screen
<br>
<br>I lost a day to where I could've called back TMobile to ship another thanks to the Lemon Grove store.

Incredibly short hours. I drove out of my way to find I was 7 minutes after closing at 7pm. I gave it two stars: 1 Cheapest prices on fuel. 2 so much room and so many services available. However: besides the short hours; the property, buildings and equipment all looked like it was all just barely hanging on and needs a lot of attention and work.<//text>

< Review>
. If your not Hindi they’ll tell you the lot is full. I didn’t believe it when I read it on truckers path but it’s true. Sadly it’s very true.  I wouldn’t spend a dollar here. The smirk on cashier face said it all.< /Review>

< Review>
I booked a class via ClassPass last night to attend a class this morning. I’ve been to this studio a number of times because of the proximity to my house. I woke up with a horrendous stiff neck, but because it was too late to cancel I decided to go to the class anyway. My neck worsened on the walk to the class, so upon arrival I asked if it would be ok if I attended tomorrow’s morning session instead. The woman “working” (sitting on her phone as people were checking in) simply said “no” (In an incredibly annoying high pitched valley girl kind of way). Frustrated, I decided to take the class anyway and as I got on the machine my neck was in torturous pain during the first exercise. Starting the second exercise the same woman walked up to me and told me I couldn’t do the class without the sticky socks “but you can buy some for $17 dollars” (she added again in her annoying valley girl tone). That was the straw that broke the camels back. I won’t be returning here, despite the proximity and convenience. I’ll take a peloton yoga class at home instead.<//Review>

<text>Absolutely love this location. There is plenty of parking space underneath the building. The studio is huge, beautiful, clean, and well maintained. The staff is knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly. All the instructors are well trained and very supportive. The schedule is super convenient. Classes are offered on the half hour (almost all day long). You decide how long you want to workout (25 vs 50 minutes). You can also pick the choice of classes (full body, bootyburn, coresculpt, etc..). Classes are $12 each and cheaper than if booked on ClassPass. At last, the Supra; a one of kind fitness marvel and def the future of fitness. A must try for anyone looking to get back in shape or already in shape but wanting a workout that is completely different.< /text><user>118025587328018885107< /user>< time>

Lagree has absolutely changed the way I go about fitness. I leave every class feeling better about myself than the last, and it has truly been a life changer. I can see and feel the changes it has made in my body. As someone who NEVER looked forward to working out-- I cannot say enough good things about Lagree, the classes, the instructors-- the whole vibe! I honestly and truly love it. HIGHLY recommend.< /text>

<text>Lagree is no joke. This workout is incredibly intense. I have taken classes from a few instructors and my favorite is Lauren. She is great at explaining the exercises clearly and makes sure you have good form the entire time. If you are new, I highly recommend trying her class. The best part of this is that the workout is only 25 minutes. Really love this place and I wish I had tried it sooner. Definitely keeping this on my workout rotation.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2beb3a0770227:0xd8e704c46bfb6b23< /Gmap_id>< date>

When I first heard about Lagree Fitness, I wasn't sure that it was something that was going to work for me. My roommate begged me to attend a class and I ABSOLUTELY loved it. From the moment you arrive, the positive energy that you feel when you walk into the studio is contagious.. It's very easy to be intimidated by the equipment and the concept, however, the staff welcomes you with open arms and guide you through how to successfully take their classes. After several classes I got the hang of how the studio worked, yet each time I went I became more challenged mentally, physically and emotionally. Unlike other studios, Lagree gives you the personal attention necessary, while still having the support of those around you. This Studio is amazing and I recommenced everyone check it out!< /Review><user>101919468256546678768</user><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

All of the instructors at the West Hollywood location have been amazing, but my personal favorite so far has been Mark. I am so glad to have stumbled upon Lagree Fitness! Although I did take a break around the holidays, partly because I was out of town, I am back and ready to go for more!!<//Text>< Pictures>

I had heard great things about Lagree and specifically this studio prior to taking a class. I was anxious and excited to try my first class. I will say, I was extremely intimidated my first class, everything was going wrong in terms technique. I had no idea what I was doing. Although I felt somewhat defeated, I was eager to get back in and give it another shot. I went to my second class and had more confidence and knew I’d be hooked. Because the classes are short, it’s perfect for when you need to squeeze in a work out without feeling like your workout is compromised. It’s very challenging in the best way and leaves you hurting and yet wanting more. The staff is always very nice and the instructors are hands on and know what they’re doing. Since taking classes at Lagree West Hollywood, I have raved about this studio to all of my friends and they now love it too.< /Text>

Game Changer. Love this 25 minute work-out. Isolates muscles I never knew I had. I love that I’m in and out in no time and yet I see more results than I see in most other hour to hour and a half workouts I’ve tried.  Favorite new workout in LA.<//review>

Anyone looking for a stronger core to take your lifting to the next level, try a few Core Sculpt classes with Lacey Looney. I feel and see the different in my core stability and strength and plan on continuing incorporating this as part of my strength training moving forward. I appreciate the attention the trainers give on fine tuning form for maximum muscle isolation and activation. I work in Culver City but live in the South Bay so the only thing I wish is that there was a studio closer.< /review>

<Review>Great classes. It is fun when the machine is turning and tilting: this adds a nice variety to the routine and helps exercise different muscle groups. I like short, 25 mins, classes because it is easy to fit them into my schedule. One can always take two classes in a row, if desired. The studio, however, is going to change to 50 mins classes.< /Review><UserId.>105939693670679746818<//UserId.><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2beb3a0770227:0xd8e704c46bfb6b23<//Gmap_id><user_name>Olga E< /user_name></record>

<Review>I'm not used to high-intensity workouts and wound up loving the Lagree method on the Supra. I thought it was a private gym, the machines look so high-tech, but it's not. It's for everybody and for all levels. A girl named Jenny taught my class and she was the best! Gave all of us the personal attention we needed. By the end of the class we were dripping with sweat and ready for more.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Seriously one of the most challenging workouts out there!  Just a simple tilt or incline makes a whole lot of difference.  Definitely gets to that burn real quick.  The 25min format makes it easy to get your workout in, no matter how busy your schedule may be.  Bonus - there's free underground parking!  How many places in LA offer that?!< /Text>

Love the teachers here. It’s a great, quick way to get your workout in. They offer tons of classes all day so you can fit in a workout anytime. Appreciate the motivated feedback from instructors and the attention they give to form. Classes are difficult and I always feel stronger after. The studio is clean and all the staff are great!<//Review>

<review>Their classes are pretty challenging but I love it because it’s so effective & its only for 25 minutes!! The instructors are all very friendly. I think that this workout definitely helps to tone the muscles & i see results immediately. I love this studio! :)<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I love the Lagree studio in West Hollywood! It's a great way to get in a tough workout when you have limited time. Samantha is one of the best group fitness instructors I've had anywhere. She's warm and supportive while also challenging you and keeping you accountable. Highly recommend this studio!< /Review>< pics>

Lagree is amazing. You absolutely cannot find a better workout than what is offered at Lagree Fitness Studio. The two best parts - only 25 minutes to get WORKED, and it is always challenging, not matter how skilled or strong you are. Unbeatable!< /Review>

All of the instructors are fantastic- they're incredibly attentive, encouraging and knowledgeable, and I especially love Lauren, Sarah and Lacy. Working out is typically the very last thing I want to do late in the day on a Friday after a long week, and I don't think twice about heading to Lauren's class- her energy and choreography are amazing. Can't say enough wonderful things about this workout and the instructors!< /Text>< pictures>

I've done 5 classes so far and I'm really liking this workout! So nice that it's only 25 minutes too. It takes a few classes to understand the machine but it's a great class and the female instructors are really helpful and nice! Definitely going to keep coming back.< /Text>

That being said, you must go to the Beginner classes to learn the process, at least 3 times. Then I had to try differnt instructors to find the ones that worked best with the way I work out. It takes time. But once I did, there was the freedom to begin the transition into the body I've always wanted - in less than an hour a session!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I finally came to this location due to unfortunate circumstances (Westwood location needed repairs), BUT I absolutely loved it! Here are my reasons: FREE 90 minute parking below (shaded), same amazing machine, great instructors (Brian!), and killer workout! I'll definitely alternate going to both location in the future.< /text>

<review>The Supra is ABSOLUTELY amazing!! The toughest 25 min total body workout out there! I am loving the Supra’s intensity it’s bringing to the already intense Lagree Method. I have always been active and this has been my favorite workout ever!  This extremely effective 25 min workout has improved my overall strength and endurance, and I am amazed how strong my core has become.  You will truly work muscles you have never worked before.  I HIGHLY recommend the Lagree Fitness Studio! Everyone at the studio is wonderful - from the engaging and motivating owner to the top-notch instructors, to the friendly front-desk staff; making new friends with the staff and other clients have been an added bonus.< /review>< Pics>

IN LOVE with this workout! Coming from a performing arts background, normal workouts at the gym started to become mundane. The Supra allows me to get in a complete full body session in such a short time and not only works every muscle, but works with my hectic schedule as well. There is also a super convenient parking garage downstairs..that's FREE! The trainers are phenomenal, the owners are superb, and the workout is amazing. You can't go wrong!:)<//Review>

Don't let the short workout time fool you - it's the hardest half hour class you'll ever take! I like going in the mornings before work to get a quick sweat in at the start of my day. I've never taken a pilates class like this before with a moving reformer - it makes the resistance even more intense. The class is different every time so you never get bored of the moves. All of the instructors play great music. Great class!<//text>

Sam gives a lot of individual attention to make sure that you have good form. This class really makes you feel good sore, even a few days after the class is done! Highly recommend!</text>< pics>

I absolutely love Lagree Fitness Studio!! I spent a good portion of 2018 doing Lagree, but took a break as I moved away from my old studio, and spent more time in the gym. But, I wanted to get back into it, and I'm soooo happy that I came across this wonderful studio. I feel amazing! The instructors here really push you, and I feel almost more exhausted after a 25 minute workout, than I would after an hour lifting. 10/10 would recommend!</Review>

I've been a fitness enthusiast for over thirty years. But I never experienced anything like Lagree. I couldn't recommend it more strongly. In 25 minutes you will get a better workout than you could ever get in spending 4X that amount of time in a normal gym on your own. You won't know until you try. Just do it.<//Review>

The Lagree instructors are top-notch. This is a super efficient, challenging yet fun workout. When that supraformer goes up, you are compelled to hold on for your life, engaging all of your muscles for quick results.< /review>

Probably my favourite class I've ever done.  I'd like to say it's twenty five minutes of sheer joy - but it isn't -- it's hard.  But so worth it.  The tutors are thorough and knowledgeable, and you're in and out before you know.  Definitely worth 25 minutes of your day.< /Review>

This location has a lot of machines, so the energy is really fun while still getting personal attention from the teacher!  The machine looks more intimidating then the megaformer, but you'll be alright.  When it starts to move, it's like holy cow, this is amazing!!  You feel everything burn so much deeper, in the best way.  Totally next level.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I am hooked!! This is by far one of my favorite studios in LA. Super challenging, and I love efficient the classes are since they are under a half hour, especially in the mornings before work. I prefer the Full Body class. I've been to Samantha, KJ, Jenny and Ty and all of them are excellent and pay close attention to form. There aren't many studios that I pay for outside of ClassPass and my spin studio, but this is one of the very few that I think is highly worth it. Don't forget to bring your own towel and grip socks!< /review>

<review>I’m a fairly new to Lagree Fitness Studio, but I can already tell a huge difference. I’ve been to 5 classes, and I’m still super sore after each one (I’m the best way possible). It’s the only 25 minute class that leaves me dripping sweat and with wobbly legs. I love how quick and efficient the classes are. It helps me stick to it because it gives you that “I can do anything for 25 minutes” mentality.

Besides the class itself, there is free parking in the structure on Westmount Drive, the studio and bathrooms are super clean, and staff and teachers are friendly. Bring your own water and towel and always wear grippy/toe socks. Get ready for a real challenge!</review>< Time>

<text>I feel like i have to write my reviews right after class so you get the raw response. Samantha Rabon is INSANE. Wow. The 8-count is real. 20 minutes after the class and my heart is still racing. I don't want to know the soreness I will feel tomorrow. Samantha is AWESOME, AMAZING, INCREDIBLE. She comes by and makes all those small corrections that take an exercise from a 10 out of 10 to a 23 out of 5.

And again, to all the newbies: I highly recommend starting with a few one-on-one pilates reformer machines so you have a true understanding of your body. Then graduate to the megaformer machine (Like a studio MDR, or SLT in NYC) and then once you've done that for a while, show up here and take your workouts to places you didn't know were possible.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Could not love Lagree more... As a fitness obsessive, I thought there was no way to get a good enough workout in 25 minutes, but after every single class, I am sore for days. The best part: the exercises dont hurt my joints or strain my muscles... and my abs have NEVER been more defined!<//Text>

<Text>I've done other pilates and megaformer classes but none of the other classes give me the burn within 2 minutes of starting the class like Lagree Fitness Studio. The instructors are great and the studio itself is simple but practical. There's plenty of machines and getting a full body workout within 25 minutes is time effective and makes me push myself even further.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Lagree is an amazing workout! I am used to running and rock climbing and the lagree model is a great change of pace that hits a whole body workout. The transformer machines only add to the challenge! Jenny is always awesome for a Wednesday morning full body workout and Lauren is an absolute rockstar!< /Review>

I went in expecting 25 minutes to be easy and to short, after 4 minutes on the Supra i was humbled and sweating from places i didn't know possible.

I have been doing the workout a few times a week and absolutely love the studio.

After taking classes at 25 minutes on the supra, I have no excuse to not workout. I used to go to the gym and spend hours theres without seeing results; now, I find the gym boring.  The workouts are efficient esp at this studio. They have the supra where the equipment inclines and tilts. It's always challenging yet fun.  I always double up and take two classes. My favorites are 25 minutes of arms and abs and 25 minutes of full-body classes. This studio also has PARKING!!! Located underground. Make sure you get to class early, so you don't miss a second of the workout. 25 minutes passes by SO quickly!< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1549253922476, 'text': 'Jackie, you booked the wrong studio on ClassPass. I went over this with you several times. I do not own ClassPass I cannot switch locations. I can simply sign you in or late cancel you. I told you that I would contact ClassPass on your behalf and try to get a refund for you. That was not acceptable. I’m sorry you did not book the correct location and you booked via a third party. I tried to work with you but you had to keep screaming over me. Good luck to you.'}< /Resp>< review>
BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY! Their policies are extremely strict and the ownership (Danielle) is extremely rude and does not believe in providing a good customer experience. You can tell her employees are scared of her and don't believe in the company's values. To not work with clients who accidentally book wrong locations and try to run with their money providing ZERO flexibility when they own all their locations shows that they do not know how to get things done or know the true value of customer service. Note they also "require grip socks" aka just another way to take as much money from their customers as possible selling their $18 slip socks... I've visited over 20 Lagree classes across the country and this is the very first one I've heard of "requiring" grip socks.. they just want as much money as possible for their short, ineffective 25 min classes.< /review>

< Review>
I've taken a LOT of pilates & other workout classes in LA and this is hands down my FAVORITE! In my opinion, it's the hardest and most challenging class LA has, but what I love most is that it's low impact, so my joints are never in pain. There's no jumping or running, just truly isolated, slow & focused training. You'll push yourself, and sweat, and shake, but jussst when you get to the point when you think "Kill me, I can't take anymore" class is over & YOU DID IT!! 25 minutes classes are so perfect. Also, another plus is free parking in the underground structure :)<//Review>

This is the most intense and dynamic muscle training workout ive ever done!

The technology of their proprietary Supra reformers makes the exercises 10 times as intense, so all those supporting muscles are firing and building an experience that will make you sweat just holding a plank!

I challenge all those muscle jocks in the gym to try this class . You will be crying ,
Crying by the end!< /text>

I come to the Westwood location for a great workout with Sarah H. and always leave with my arms and legs shaking! She has endless energy and somehow makes me enjoy working out muscles I’ve never worked out before. The Westwood location is convenient to squeeze in a workout between work and dinner. Can’t wait for my next class!<//review>

If you've tried any other Lagree/Pilates Plus style workout definitely give this a try.  It leans more towards heavy weight training than regular pilates, and I'm always dripping sweat.

<text>I had been to Lagree a few times with a friend who’s a regular and I loved each class, even though my body was like “whyyyyyy are you doing this?!”

The first time I signed up, I thought to myself only 25 mins?! Not a big deal. But quickly realized that a 25 min workout will be tough. It is tough, but it’s the best workout ever. My two fave instructors Sam and Ty (I’ve only ever taken their classes) are fantastic, attentive and provide great adjustments.

I loved the classes so much, I bought 30 classes and head over on the wknds. Just wish they had a studio on the west side!< /text>< username>

LaGree is my absolute favorite place to get toned and sculpted! I see immediate results and I am a certified Yoga and Pilates teacher and ex ballerina. The core sculpt class really puts me in touch with my transverse abdominals and snatches my waist. The instructors have amazing energy and are very knowledgeable. The class is challenging but manageable even for a very beginner. I recommended Lagree to everyone!< /text>

<Text>Lagree Fitness is the hardest and best Pilates class in the WeHo/Beverly Hills area. I love Katie Jo and Brian. You can't go wrong with either of them. This is not your mother's pilates class.

I love taking Supra classes with the inspiring master trainer Sharnee Lee Scott! Admittedly, the Supras are large and intense machines but before you feel too intimidated to try it, take a Sharnee class! She is encouraging and technical - her diligent focus on form, tempo, and range of motion helps you maximize every second of your workout. You can tell Sharnee has extensive knowledge of muscle/body composition and anatomy, which I love in a trainer! Don't be fooled by the length of the classes - with Sharnee's hands-on corrections and encouragement, you'll definitely feel the burn! I highly recommend Sharnee, the Lagree method, and the Lagree Fitness studio!<//text>

< Review>
With these 2 dish, there was hot pot, spicy wings, clam chowder, and fries that are not shown.

I'm rating this review off of the Stuffed chicken that I ordered. It was ok. Didn't have much flavor. I didn't finish it.

From the others that I was with, They enjoyed the rest of the food. I do have to say the chicken wings has a good kick of spice.<//Review>

<text>Central Valley's best card room! Good poker action. Great food. Fun atmosphere. Nice bar/restaurant. Decent promotions for poker. Management, dealers, servers, hosts are all pretty good these days. Over the past few years they have really stepped up their game. Props to them!< /text>< pictures>

It's a great place to come out and hang out with groups of friends. The food is good and the service is good. The restaurant is on a small size but it will hold 85 people max.

The casino part is really fun but no slots. Just card games. Pretty fun to just watch if you aren't gonna play. The dealers and staff are also fun and cheerful. I will visit again soon.<//Review>

Club one Casino has an extremely varied menu all of which would be a perfect choice for a fabulous meal. I still can’t get over the gourmet meatloaf with the wonderful sauce topped with fresh grilled onions. And the spaghetti is to die for. The Asian dishes are amazing. Breakfast is the best deal in town.</Text>

Should be called a card room, a big card room. Loved the freedom the dealers are allowed to enjoy. Even while not winning still had fun because the dealers are having a good time. They have a pit boss and bank at every table. Most table games you are used to and of course Poker.</text>

Food was really tasty even if the price was a little high, well worth it. Saw a stupid funny comedy show that sold out! Easy parking, nice staff. Great time all around< /text>

It's hard to find a sit down lunch or dinner venue in downtown Fresno that serves good food that  is inexpensive.  I highly recommend the Pad Thai or Spring Rolls.  Both are incredible and the service is fast, perfect when you have a limited lunch hour!<//review>< Rating>

<Review>Desperate for money and being cheap on making a good poker tournament structure. You need to have 20k starting stack now that it's ante only structure and have levels 30 minutes or it's a fools game to even consider playing. We'll pay the increase rake but you need to give us a better structure or we'll go elsewhere!<//Review>< response>

<Text>I love coming to club one with our friends, it's always a good time!  They have a really diverse menu, so it's great to bring large groups who all want to order different food and they're always open which is incredible for downtown.  I also really enjoy the drinks here, Justin made me my very first bloody maria and it was the perfect amount of spice.  They also make a killer martini.  10/10 recommend, the regulars and the staff are always a hoot!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8094609fe8f70b57:0x2ea7a56cb217b6ed<//Gmap_id></record>

The fries were great. The people were kind. The two brothers that r security guards r awesome. They made the whole visit great. Opening dóors as we r n wheelchairs. They made us laugh n feel very welcome n comfortable. The concession girl that made our Starbucks was very kind also. She customized our Starbucks for us. All n all it was a very pleasant visit!! Just expensive.</Text>

<Text>The restraurant had very cheesy and tasty pizza offered.  That was the one thing I tasted (and enjoyed)there.  I cannot speak for other than what I experienced.  The wait staff was courteous and efficient.  I had not interest in the gambling areas though walked through them to reach the restroom.</Text>< Pics>

For one it's the only Casino here in town, as far as I know. I have only been in it a few times, I'm not much of a gambler. Inside the place looks pretty classy. And has a steady class of customers. Nice and peaceful atmosphere. The employees are nice and polite. Very professional. I would go back if it's only to have a drink or to meet a friend their for an evening of catch up and to have a bite to eat.< /Text>

<text>They discriminate and judge people by appearance. They weren't going to let me in until I showed them my ID and a few twenty dollar bills. So I'm different. Does that make me unacceptable unless I money? That can be hurtful.

I would say 99% of the time the food is horrible, they really need kitchen staff that knows what they're supposed to be cooking. I have on two occasions got chicken that was not fully cooked. I have ordered the specials that are on the board and what I was served was nothing close to what I ordered. On this particular occasion I ordered the chicken and green bean stir fry over rice. I got a bland version of chicken with vegetables over rice. When I brought this up to the waiter he kindly went to the kitchen to get me green beans, even though I didn't ask him to,. When he returned to my table he handed me a small plate with green beans on it and said here you go. I grab the plate and on it were frozen green beans. He apologized and stated that he wasn't sure the cook knew what he said. Either way, if I could tell the green beans or Frozen I don't know how he didn't. The one thing I will say is that I am never surprised that the food is terrible or my order is not right.<//text>

The food used to be so good. It's not great at all any more. Its convenient but not good. Hopefully they get back to the good days when they were the place to go for good food.< /text>

There’s this girl named Jennifer and she’s a dealer at club one and when we played poker against each other at the deuce casino... she showed me she had a jack when I was about to call with my seven and she saved me fifty five dollars.  I just feel like she deserves a mention. Plus if I write this I don’t have to show her my good cards when I have’em<//Text>

It's been a benchmark of Fresno since 1991. It's loaded with action, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.

The 1/3 and 2/5 No Limit games can have anywhere from $2000 to $5000, respectively on the table at any time (especially during a Friday and Saturday night). Their 4/8 limit Hold 'Em games are especially action packed in the evening. The action can start at 7pm and the game usually will run uninterrupted all through the night. They also have a good 8/16 limit game which will mostly run Saturday evening.

Perhaps the best limit game that Club One holds is their Omaha Hi-Lo game, which runs every evening. It may be the number one action game in the club. If you like Omaha, you should check it out.< /text>

Very clean establishment, looks great, and there's free parking nearby. Honestly I didn't play any games while I was there, just sat at the bar to catch up with some friends, but the drinks were good and not too pricey. Definitely would recommend this place!<//Text>

The atmosphere is good but there's not a lot of interaction with the guests and the staff, especially if you're new. There's not a lot of signs giving you directions and where to begin at once you walk in through the doors. You are greeted by either a staff or the security guard, but that's about it. I don't need someone to hold my hand but it can be a little disorienting to figure out what you want to do first.<//review>

When everything's closed and the only option you have is Denny's or fast food, come here. This place serves delicious food all night long. From Asian cuisine to hamburgers they're food is great and will not break the bank. After you're done eating you can enjoy a card game with one of the best in town.</Review>

It is just sad that the food is being sent to a restaurant living in the 80's. I heard from plenty of people working there that there were going to be some changes. I guess the owner of the place is a liar. way to get peoples' hopes up. At the end of the day, the food is good, people are friendly, but its the outdated decor that will be this place's demise.</Review>< pictures>

I go here occasionally to play baccarat. Wouldn't go anywhere else. In fact, I'm over due for a visit.

*hollers at wife* Honey, club one tonight. You can go, or not. But I'm going.

Friendly and clean atmosphere. No slot machine but that's fine with me . Gimme baccarat.< /Review>

I love this place. My odds of winning here is so much better for in town casino then other places. However, the food, I'm not a big fan. They need a better cook for the pho selection. It's horrible. Just FYI, you need an Asian cook to cook asian dish.<//review>

Great place for a quick drink, I normally try to find a park in the Van Ness side, they have a few green 30 minute parking spots right there between the EECU at Fresno street and Tulare. I park get my drink then head out 15 minutes max.< /review>

This is only the second time I've been in a card room.My wife and I were walking around and the games supervisor asks us if he could help and couldn't be more helpful directing us and explaining to us the different games.The dealers,waitress and other employees were very friendly.The UFC fight was on numerous TV's and everyone seemed to be having a good time.The table limits were reasonable but the commissions on pai gow seemed excessive compared to Nevada.Overall the experience was fun and enjoyable.<//review>

Been to this place before has really good burgers. Their kung pow chicken was awesome really fresh. The fries were crispy and hot. The only thing is the waitress are slow and not very friendly. Other than that good restaurant for a casino.< /review>

<text>Great food,great environment I love the sports bar that they have but the food service there is horrible during Ufc fights. I was there earlier with my gf and order a drink& appetizer we didn't get our food untill 1hr 45mins our server Elvie was very rude and when we asked for a drink menu she just handed us food menu and just walked away. Unless you're there to gamble or unless you have money or you're a regular then you'll get fast service.<//text></record>

<user>105666458874320368928<//user><text>I work there doing the security. We take the safety of our patrons very seriously. This casino does not have any slot machines. Is only a card room. If you plan on coming here to play, bring your A game. This Casino is one of very few stops in California for the Heartland Poker Tour. Good food, cannot beat the price. Stop in and check it out for yourself sometime.<//text>< gmap_id>

Our first time having dinner and the experience was horrible. The table we sat was dirty and asked waiter to wipe off. Food had no flavor, we order corona with lime and a malibu breeze which took the waiter more than 15 minutes to bring until I reminded him. We also asked for water with lemon and extra lemon, no lemon. This experience was awful and will not be returning. Customer service was so unsatisfactory. I recommend not going to resturant.<//Review>

<Text>I tend to visit weekly because I work right behind them, for about a year  I have dinner there every Saturday, since everything else is c0lsed downtown, Food is ok, the pricing is good, but the staff is so bad, the girls chit chat by the bar, they ignore clients, its a fairly slow service and they are simply too busy on their social life to care. Although for me its a must, this is not a place I would recommend for a special night.< /Text><date>1494964750362<//date><Name>Sandra Chaires</Name>< userid>

Dealers are personable friendly and love to see u win! The employees make up the atmosphere in a casino and like all gambling losing is inevitable so you have to have a balance to offset the negative and the dealers do a great job of it!</review>

I was unsure about the reviews so I tryed the place but it was very disappointing, Club One needs a renovation inside and out; including different chefs. The restaurant inside needs quality food, not over cooked, saggy steamed rice, and stale vegetables. The bar gets violent at night but during the day there's no consumers, the place is a ghost town.  I would discourage you from eating here because its not worth the time or day. [1/10]< /text>

<Text>Horrible experience at this casino. I am visiting Fresno for work and read on the reviews of this casino; I was informed this hotel was worth a visit, I was informed wrong!

The food was not bad for the price, I played a few games of blackjack, friendly dealers. I'm a big tipper and probably the only one who tipped.

The main reason I visited was for the poker, there was a wait list and only one game available, so I put my name on the list for the 1/3 no limit, after an hour into playing BlackJack they opened a new table. Great table, great players, friendly attitude, and the dealers were VERY friendly. The floor not so much. We had a great table going and our chip leader was relocated to another table which we all were upset (including him), to see him go, then when another chip leader was instructed to move he threw a fit requesting NOT to be moved, because our table had action. The floor told him he had to move or he couldn't play, so the player pulled his chips and left the game; about 5 of the players at the table commented how the action was all gone and there were no chips to play against. I was the only chipleader at the table ($480ish) - at this point I made a joke to the floor saying the table denies the move of the chipleaders to the floor (Her name was MeeMee) - at this point she told me if I had a complaint/problem I needed to step aside and address her. I told her up front it was ridiculous and defeated the purpose of most of us wanting to play because the casino (or her) was killing the action - she gave me negative attitude and said "If you don't like it don't play here," at which I commented Yelp will be hearing about my rating.

At this point she gave me an attitude and I asked her for her name, which she immediately covered it up (which of course I already knew it was MeeMee) - I told her I'm from out of town and play at other poker rooms, including Vegas and from all my experience playing over 10 years in card rooms this was by far the most unprofessional; at this point she asked me out loud for the table to hear, "If you play in Vegas, why are you playing at a $1/3 table?" which pretty much was taken as an insult, the majority of the tables, including dealer heard it and even saw it as a "low-blow." At this point 4 of the players who had a stack cashed out, and I followed there-after.

All in all, the dealers are amazing, the insult I received from the floor basically calling me "poor" on how she addressed it, was very unprofessional. I told her I wouldn't visit the casino again for the remainder of my visit in the city during the week, she basically said "GOOD." - I tipped the dealer over $75 after I cashed out proving to her how much I was there for fun, not for the money; the floor took the fun out of my visit, I rate this casino in the negative if I could...I suggest if you go, the floor will do whatever it takes to ruin your time.

Oh, and another funny thing, as soon as I picked my chips up and left she told the cashier to put a "on-break" sign on the cage...talk about a cheap casino.</Text>< rating>

<Review>Love it here just make sure u park underground cause I had a bad experience parking my car on the street other then that I have a blast here but there is some workers and gamblers that act snobby but don’t let that bother u and don’t let the others tell u how to call ur cards ,cause everyone is in it for them selves.</Review><date>1542780394645< /date>< Pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Nice environment for our clubs where the staff can also play at the cash game poker tables .. Jackpot every two hours for the best hand and on Saturday the final draw. I don't like it when the dealer looks at the cards of those who fold or covertly turn and river. There are giant screens on four different sports channels, and table games like blackjack and a Chinese game. Free drinks excluding alcohol

(Original)
Ambiente simpatico stile nostri circoli dove può giocare anche lo staff ai tavoli da poker cash game.. Jackpot ogni due ore per la mano migliore e al sabato estrazione finale. Non mi piace quando il dealer guarda le carte di chi folda o guarda di nascosto turn e river. Presenti maxischermi su quattro canali sportivi differenti, e giochi da tavolo come blackjack e un gioco cinese. Gratis i drink escluso alcolici<//Text></record>
