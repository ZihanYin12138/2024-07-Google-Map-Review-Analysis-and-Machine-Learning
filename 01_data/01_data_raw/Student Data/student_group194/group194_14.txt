I liked this trail. It was a bit hard on the beginning, but then it became more or less flat. At the end you will be rewarded with the beautyful view of Lake Tahoe and the lakes behind the crest. Some snow patches today made the hike more enjoyable and fun :)< /review>

Beautiful hike, but get there early if you want a good parking spot. The trail gets a little crowded in the afternoon since you come back on the same trail, but take your time exploring the creek and Cascade Falls, there are plenty of little hidden gems all around. Also bring some lunch as there are plenty of places to hang out in the shade and enjoy the views while you eat.<//Review>

Recommend for sunrise/sunset hike as it's a short 3/4mi in and another 3/4mi out. Seems heavily tracked although I've only seen three people out there for my sunset hike. My favorite part was hanging out on a rock and sitting there with some folks but definitely go to the waterfall.

About the hike, it's not strenuous. Incline is steady. GOOD FOR KIDS. Be mindful driving to the trailhead. You drive through a campsite before reaching the parking lot.<//Text>

Was here and the views were amazing. The waterfall thats there doesn't actually run year round or much so it was disappointing to hike 40ish mintues to no waterfall.
However dont let that discourage you from going. Its breath taking.
What I would say though is make sure to use the restroom before driving in and to cool it on the water.
The restrooms are horrible. As in if I were to post a picture of it on here it would make you sick.
Let's just leave it at that.< /Text>

Walked the Cascade falls trail,, amazing views of Emerald Bay and Lake Tahoe.  Easy to moderate trail 1.5 miles with light hill climbs. The falls are very nice considering its mid-summer, still pretty good flow. One of my favorite short hikes.</Text>

<Review>Unparalleled views. Glad I went.  Even happier that I didn't give myself a heart attack.  Seriously, this trail is no joke!   Grades are steep and consistent ALL the way up.  Desolation Trail, you'd think the name would have given me a clue!!
Anyway, I am 55 years old and sedintary.   There was a woman up there looking for her dog.  She had already gone up and down the trail, and then JOGGED back up calling for her dog.  Wow,  she was a beast!!!!  So it's all relative to your fitness level.  Take water, for sure.   I wish I had sprayed bug repellent on my arms beforehand.  Otherwise, no regrets.  We went late in the day, no trouble parking or crowds. Nice!<//Review>< pictures>

Great hike, INCREDIBLE views, a good uphill challenge. We left about 9 am, and saw very few people, until our descent. I highly recommend starting at Bayview and ending at Eagle - Eagle seems to be a lot steeper ascent. We were able to easily walk back to our car at Bayview.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Get there early so you get a spot - especially if you are spending days in the backcountry.  Also, bears are wild here, so don't keep food in your cars..<//Text>

Beautiful hike to Velma Lakes. Note that you start going uphill for a couple of miles. Beautiful views once you get to the top of the ridge.< /review>

What are you going to expect from a church that starts of with being disingenuous with it's parishioners by calling it self a, Catholic Church. Makes me wonder why they just don't call them selves a Christian Church?-  Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not deceive one another. Leviticus 19:11< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I am so disappointed. People that work at a church should show more kindness since they should know better from working there “serving god” and the community. I called to request a certificate of a sacrament the guy told me I have to drive there personally to request it and that it would take weeks for them to look for it. I told him my situation and if he can please help me out he straight up told me “No I can’t help you” I was upset by his response. Plus no friendliness when talking no good customer service skills. Everything is so wrong with this. I’ve called other parishes they help me immediately or at least give me alternatives and treat me kindly as brothers and sisters we all are.</text>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd34894cff6787:0x89ac36c2856f75b0</Gmap_id><Review>Right now in the world that's the problem "comfort"  Faith in God is not about comfort is about commitment and knowing the truth.

(John 8:31-32) So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; 32and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." you see truth doesn't come in being comfortable, truth is being in communion with The Father The Son and The Holy Spirit. This old catholic church broke off from the True Roman Catholic Church many centuries ago as many have broken off. They believe their pastors rather than Christ's true Church.

Denying that Jesus is Who He said He Was

“Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.”
1 John 2:22-23
There are many people in our world today who think of themselves as spiritual or even religious people. They believe that God exists, and they attempt to worship him in their own way. Maybe they even see Jesus as a great teacher or a prophet from God. But if they don’t believe that Jesus is who HE said He is, they are denying Him.
Seeing Jesus merely as a great moral teacher is still rejecting Him and therefore rejecting God. God directs our attention to Jesus as the Savior of the world and He doesn’t offer us any alternative paths (John 14:6, Acts 4:12). So rejecting Jesus is rejecting God. But, as John 1:12 says, “to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” Anyone can be a child of God, if they would believe upon Jesus.< /Review>< rate>

They are not registered with the Diocese and they do not follow the teachings of the Pope. What they have here is a business, anything you want they will provide along with a price tag. Their sacraments are not valid because they do strange things during their ceremonies, if you are catholic and practice your faith... you will see the "strange" things they do with no problem. They are lairs and scandalous, warn your friends and families from this crooks!< /review>< Pics>

This church is a fraud!!! Any baptism, first communion, or wedding done here is not done under the Catholic faith, because this church is not a registered Catholic Church.  If you were baptized at this church and wanted to have your first communion at another Catholic Church, they will not accept your baptism certificate.  They also refuse to give refunds! The whole process is a scam!!!</review>

Im very dissapointed finding out after 8yrs of having baptized my daughter here IT WASN'T A VALID baptism. Im having to re-baptize my daughter do to the fact that this "church" isn't  recognized as a registered catholic church. Im glad i found out now while she's ready to do her first communion.< /Text>

<Review>This Church is a fraud.... I had my son do his 1st communion here in 05, I never recieved a certificate for him. I called the Archdiocese Of Los Angeles to get a copy of the 1st Communion certificate and they told me that they dont have records for him. They did ask me the name of the church and said that this church is not regerster or Roman there for his 1st Communion was nit valid. I believe that these people are only taking advantage of catholic people and taking their money. I just called the church and the person in charge of the registrations (Raquel) had a very bad attitude and act very suspicious. She said that why all the questions and that I did not need to know he last name that that was personal. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS FRAUD, MY SON HAS TO TAKE THESE CLASSES AGAIN. :(</Review><rating>2<//rating><response>None<//response>< pics>

This is a place were con man pretend to be catholics, they exploit the image of the Virgin Mary as Guadalupe to con hispanics but they are NOT part of the catholic church, they should make this clear but they don't, and con people thinking they recieved valid sacraments there. It is a fraud.< /Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I have nothing against the Roman Catholic churches but it is true that the Roman Catholic churches and the archaeologists do not recognize the sacraments of God just because they do not give an account to the archdiosis of anything else, the catechism is taught in 6 months and not in 2 years . Since in the bible it does not specify how long it should be memorized.

(Original)
No tengo nada contra la iglecias catolica romanas pero es cierto que la iglesias catolicas romanas y el arquediosis no reconocen los sacramentos de dios solo porque no le dan cuentas al arquidiosis de nada otro punto el catesismo lo en señan el 6 meses y no en 2 años. Ya que en la biblia no espesifica en cuanto tiempo se debe de memorizarlo.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) In the Church there is an atmosphere of brotherhood and peace, there is much talk about the Church, but if you are a Catholic believer, you should know that God is everywhere as long as you are well with God ... and IF GOD IS WITH YOU, who is against you. Live and let each person live their faith and practice it wherever everyone wants ...

(Original)
En la Iglecia se siente un ambiente de hermandad y paz se habla mucho de la Iglecia pero si eres creyente catolico deverian de saber que Dios esta en todo lugar mientras uno este bien con Dios.... y  SI DIOS ESTA CONTIGO quien contra ti.. vivan y dejen vivir a cada persona su fe y que la practiquen a donde cada quien quiera ...<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They are going to end the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant population as well as the Hispanic Protestant migrant. From the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation of the 16th century, a Protestant and rich north of Europe was drawn against a poor and Catholic south. In America it is the same. Protestantism is more democratic and liberal, it does not support dictatorships as Catholicism does and it respects the citizen more. Consequently, it forms a more advanced and wealthy country.

Protestantism offers a radically different view of life from Catholicism. For example, facing the problem of poverty, Catholicism promotes feeding the hungry while Protestantism defends more than giving a fish to give a pole to the poor and teach them to fish. Better that this church be Christian and that the priest instead of being Catholic becomes a Methodist Christian or Episcopalian or Jewish or Calvinist

(Original)
Van a acabar con la poblacion blanca anglosajona protestante tanto migrante hispano Protestantismo. A partir de la Reforma protestante y la Contrarreforma católica del siglo XVI se dibujaron un norte de Europa protestante  y rico frente a un sur católico y pobre. En América ocurre igual. El protestantismo es más democrático y liberal, no apoya dictaduras como hace el catolicismo y respeta más al ciudadano. En consecuencia, forma un país más avanzado y rico.

El protestantismo ofrece una visión de la vida radicalmente distinta del catolicismo. Por ejemplo, frente al problema de la pobreza el catolicismo promueve dar de comer al hambriento mientras que el protestantismo defiende más que dar un pescado dar una caña al pobre y enseñarle a pescar. Mejor que está iglesia sea cristiana y que el sacerdote en ves de ser católico se haga cristiano metodista o episcopalino o judío o calvinista</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

It is very sad to see that these men (priests) abuse and harm the good Faith of the People of God. married men, outside OBEDIENCE TO THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH, desecrating the body of Christ Jesus.

This is not a Church, it is a SECTA, of a group of men who want to have money and power. Brother, Friend in Christ and The Blessed Virgin Mary! PASS THE VOICE. I invite you to Pray for these Men and so many more, so that they may straighten their Souls. GOD BLESS YOU.

Queridos Hermanos,  los Invito en el Amor a Cristo a defender la Verdad, que es Jesus y La Santisima Eucaristia.  Es muy triste ver que estos hombres (sacerdotes) abusan y dañan la buena Fe del Pueblo de Dios.  hombres casados, fuera de la OBEDIENCIA A LA SANTA IGLESIA CATOLICA, profanando el cuerpo de Cristo Jesus.

Esta no es una Iglesia, es una SECTA, de un grupo de hombres que quieren tener dinero y poder.  Hermano, Amigo en Cristo y La Santisima Virgen Maria !  PASA LA VOZ.    Los Invito a Orar por estos Hombres y tantos mas, para que puedan enderezar sus Almas.  DIOS LOS BENDIGA.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<time>1450575703626<//time><Rating>3</Rating><Review>It's Open 24 Hours

This restaurant is what I have come to expect from the typical fast food restaurant.  It has food that is mostly consistent across each location.  So you know what you are getting. But the presentation and attitude of the employees is consistently disappointing.

The contrast between the employees at the Chick-fil-A down the street and this Jack-in-the-Box is a night and day. Here, the flat expression and minor disinterest in the work is a dead giveaway. And this attitude is OFTEN reflected in both the presentation of the food, the manner that it is prepared, and the taste.

I usually go through the drive-thru, and if I happen to order a Chocolate Milkshake, half of the time it will be a sloppy mess that is more liquid than shake.  The only other thing that is often done poorly is the regular french fries, which are typically burnt.

I like this restaurant because it is open 24 hours, unlike most other restaurants in the area. But if almost any other restaurant was open 24 hours, I'd probably go there instead.

Bottom Line: It's open 24 hours and it's familiar food, but the quality could use some help< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>What horrible service. The woman on the intercom was barely understandable with her mumbling, poor english skill and delay of up to 5 seconds, giving our order was frustrating.   Not a great experience.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It is not 24 hours for dine in. Opens at 6. Walked here to be told that and tried to go to the drive thru but no service, maybe cause it didn't detect I was there? Needless to say, not ever going to here again</text>

<Review>SUPER POLITE AND FAST (good prices too)

Never been so fully satisfied with a service ever. I didn’t feel like they were trying to penny and dime me at all, they showed me what was wrong so I could know for future reference, and even cleaned my brakes for free. I paid over HALF of what I would have paid anywhere else. 10/10 fully recommended this place for any tire and wheel needs.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>It use to be a good place but it has gone downhill. Every time I needed to talk to the owner he is not there the last straw for me was when they tried to say I needed an new idler arm when I was getting my truck alignment with a quote just under $900.00. I took my truck somewhere else without saying anything about the possibility of a bad idler arm and they performed the alignment and my truck drives straight as an arrow going on six plus months. They lost a loyal customer of over 30 years</Text></record>

I had an amazing experience at Bedasci tire today. They mounted my riding lawn mower rim and tire, when 3 other places wouldn't, and for very reasonable prices! I wont go anywhere else for tires!< /review>

<review>After being turned down from all the local chain shops on an installation of a part not purchased in house, Badasci tire went ABOVE and BEYOND to get me back on the road during an extremely time sensitive situation! From the receptionist to the mechanics this was a fantastic place to do business. The behind the scenes magicians (mechanics) helped me get to where I needed to be expeditiously.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1583859949774, 'text': 'Thank you for the business!'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Lemoore tires didn't have my tires so they called Badasci's for me and they not only had my tires but as soon as I got there they got right to fixing it, great service and customer service. I will be coming here from now on.<//Review>

Great burgers
Good staff
Small bar area even.
I like the options of two three or a family meal a lot.
Even your grumpy eater can pick a pattie type and anything on it.
Wings were excellent.
Fries are not something I thought id honestly like but they are my new favorites now!

Been back twice will be again;)<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ7Lnd4yCuNn-TOExkhlUcP-r0LYx_MvC7r7TI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhTvlO46SWD1zoeOGwd-bizwu8QqJsU-CjZJJI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

Overall the food was tasty. The burger needed a little more sauce, but good. The onion rings was fresh and really good. The chicken wings are huge and real spicy. Yummy. We will be back.< /Review>< pics>

Honestly, I was so hangry I failed to take pictures. Let's start with the customer service...
Two friendly face people were working (1 female and 1 male). The place was not packed and our orders were taken right away.  We received our order number and sat down. I took my cup and was so excited that they offered sparkling lemonade in pink and lime!  Okay now the food...
I ordered a hamburger, sweet potato fries and that drink I spoke about earlier (sparkling lemonade). The burger was freshly grilled. fresh lettuce, onions (no sauce because I like knowing exactly what on my food). It was a plump burger that tasted like a burger should taste. My sweet potato fries were underwhelming. They were bright orange which made me wonder if a regular potato had been dyed orange. They tasted like regular french 🍟. All in all, with the great customer service and fresh burger I would return...and order different fries😉</text>

<text>At least 3 out of 11 got food poisoned on 10/25/19. On top of that, the order was placed 30 min before 11am open and they still got the order wrong.  Our whole company wont be eating here any more.<//text><gmapID>0x809adb2fbd111ea7:0xbf9ab9b3f399202e< /gmapID>< user_id>

The kids meal was awesome, and big! They make round fries, like sliced fries potatoes, and they were great. The burgers are fat and juice. The person helping us didnt seem like he wanted to be there, but aside from his energy it was great.</Text>

Also their garlic aioli fries were nice too. Finished the meal with a strawberry shake and it was heaven on earth. Very friendly staff at the counter. I would come here again.</review>< Pics>

Worth it for the burgers 'duos' packaged in 1 to-go little box like KFC or Taco Bell. 1st time in Fairfield then our 2nd time in Sacramento for the fries which is 'scalloped' they are my husband's favorite and we think both food taste so great 👌<//text>

< Review>
I took my pants to be hemmed. On a Saturday.   I was told it would be ready the following Thursday.   I showed up on Thursday and was not ready.  I was told it always takes a week for this kind of service. So I asked the lady to write down the date it would be ready on the ticket they had given me.  She did.  I went on Saturday, the pick up date they wrote on the thicket, to pick it up and again, it was not there.  I showed up the following Monday and finally it had arrived.  Very disappointed I had to drive there 3 times to finally  be able to get my pants.   The hemming was great, but they should know that service quality includes every commitment to the customer.  They shouldn't commit to dates they can't meet.  Thanks.<//Review>

Kona delivers each and every time I go there. This time I had a shirt with spots I just could not get out..... they did. I had bought a great pair of pants but they had funky red zippers at the bottom... They switched them out to black and they look great now. Wonderful, nice people that work there and I can always count on them.< /Text>

This location is great and very quick!
They also hold your order! My husband is in construction and rarely wears a suit, I dropped a brand new suit off two years ago and FORGOT it was there, until we had another event to get dressed up for and I was so relieved the suit was still there! They even offered to have it cleaned again if we wanted.</review>

Kona is located 2 blocks from our home. Sometimes we would just walk there instead of driving. I am always greeted promptly and they are great! I dropped off on a thursday at 5pm and I received a text the next day at 3pm that my clothes were ready for pick up.  Amazing service and my clothes were nice, clean and pressed. I would really recommend their service!< /Review>

Something has horribly gone wrong. Saw a $15 for $25 coupon on Yelp and decided to use it.  Went to the merchant and showed it to the lady at the checkout.  Made the purchase and upon showing her to code, she said "can't honor it since system doesn't allow me to."  I said, "...but I just bought this in front of u..." her response, "you'll need to figure this out with Yelp! Sorry."

This used to be a great place but something seems to have changed recently.  I've given this place a 5-star before but sadly due to system snaffu and customer service, have to move it down to zero.  Lost my $15.  Disputing with Yelp.

Update: Kona cleaner management reached out to me and resolved the issue promptly.  Thank you.< /Text>

Very horrible service on deliveries. They don’t ring the bell. They rush to hook clothes on doors and door handles preventing being able to open the door. They run off and do not confirm if all clothes are delivered. Very poor service even after raising concerns multiple times. Taking my business elsewhere.</Review>

Most important, though, is that my clothes are clean.  They even look better than when I brought them in since they were previously "cleaned" by another company.  Thank you, Kona!<//review><user>110556362493764294084</user></record></dataset><record>

My initial experience with this business was not a pleasant one, but I have to say I have become a happy and loyal customer because of their customer service, the ownership they take with unsatisfactory experiences and their desire to please their customers. I have never had another negative experience and would absolutely recommend the Placentia Kona Cleaners.< /text>

<Review>Worst customer service. I asked for mushrooms and bell peppers on one of the subs and they flat out refused. I even offered to pay extra for them on the side. They still refused. Then after I posted a complaint on Facebook, they cancelled my order enntirely. I asked if I could speak to the owner to see if we could work this out. I even offered to amend my review. The owner refused to talk with me. Horrible customer service. Just horrible. And over what? A few mushrooms and bell peppers? Amazing.</Review>< Name>

Wow, this meal was delicious.  It was delivered hot & freshly made.  Brought back memories of yesteryears when food was homemade and folks cared.  I used to work in a pizza joint, too - so, now I’ve found a place that meets high expectations.

Thank you, ;)</review>

I ordered pasta and a pizza with extra garlic bread on the side the total came out to 40$ and I didn't even get my 15$ pizza. What a rip off. Way to ruin a good Saturday night dinner for two.<//review>

This is a great Italian place stuck in an incongruous nook next to Wendy's. They have terrific favorites such as lasagna, spaghetti w/meatballs, hot and cold subs, sandwiches, and more. Their tomato sauce is the best (next to mine of course), and you must try the Tiramisu. Easy, free online ordering (for pick up). Mangia!< /Review>

My husband ordered their gigantic size aliaci deluxe pizza for delivery sunday evening. First off, the onions were raw and the cheese (along with all the toppings) slid to the left side of the pizza by the time we got it. We attempted to spread the cheese and toppings back out but needless to say, it was a lost cause. We also didnt get parmesian cheese or napkins as requested! We called to complain but the young lady on the phone had us on hold for almost 10 minutes before we decided to hang up. $28.00 dollars down the drain, this is our first and last time ordering from this store.<//text>

Ordered almost $100 of family style pasta delivered. We requested plates and utensils because we are staying in a hotel and don't have any. We did not receive any. While the food was delivered within the promised window and was hot, I can't comment on the quality or taste of the food because it's pretty much impossible to eat spaghetti and meatballs and fettuccine alfredo without forks and plates. When I contacted the restaurant they said that they "can't guarantee the availability of plates and utensils." What? At least you could have told me when I ordered. They didn't offer to send any or offer any kind of compensation. Highly disappointing and a total waste of $96< /Text>

This was the absolutely worst pizza I ever ate.  It almost seemed like they were not fully cooked.  The crust was soggy on both pizzas and the onions were raw on the pizza with veges.  It's sad when you can say Pizza Hut or Domino's is better.</review>

Asked for meatball and pepperoni calzone, I got sausage and pepperoni instead. The sausage was not good and they put way to much ricotta in my opinion.<//Text>

But I can write.

< Review>
My company ordered from them for an office lunch meeting and we were less than impressed. The food was OK overall if you ordered one of their pasta dishes, but one of the salads that someone ordered was just boring and sad: tons of iceberg lettuce with some tomato, olives and grated parmesan cheese on top. Worse of all, the salad dressing container had burst in transit and it was a complete loss. A bunch of other stuff had leaked as well, so the way they package things for delivery seems inadequate. And speaking of packaging, the plastic lids on containers  for the lasagna and eggplant parmesan were so thin and flimsy that it was actually MELTED into the food--no bueno! I'd gotten the cheese ravioli, and while it wasn't offensive in any way, it was also pretty humdrum. Afterwards we all agreed that we probably won't be ordering from them again.</Review>

<Text>If only all places could have customer service as great as this place. I walked in and was greeted with a nice hello, by everyone. They gave me space to look throughout the store and then when I approached with a question they provided so much great feedback. It felt like you called up an old friend and they were genuinely excited to share the love of fishing with you. Thanks to John who helped me out and pointed me in the right direction. Definitely made a customer for life.< /Text>< Resp>

I discovered Anglers Arsenal at least 15 years ago. Awesome selection of plastics, they pour a lot of their own. And can always get good information and advice about our local, and not so local waters. Stop in and find out for yourself how great they are.< /text>

It's always a pleasure to Angler's Arsenal . I bought my first Accurate 2 speed and pole from Dave and now just helped me with my 2nd match up rod to another Accurate 2 speed that I bought from Turner's . their very inquisitive to helping the angler understanding what their using and great tips . so if your in Lakeside stop in and check the store out you'll walk out with better knowledge and understanding of your tackle and gear . thanks Dave< /Review>

There are 2 tackle shops that i go to in San Diego. Angler's Arsenal is one of them. I can trust the guys to help pick out tackle and gear, and feel confident in the choices made. Everyone is very friendly and not cocky a**holes like some tackle shops. Love these guys and rep them whenever/wherever i can.<//Review>

I'm out of town, and he absolutely LOVES the store. Being able to purchase from afar is a huge help.  After speaking with the mgt. team there at the store over the phone, I heartily agree that Angler's Arsenal is by far and away amongst the most helpful and knowledgeable in the business.
We're up in Washington state and it was great to "fish-speak" and share happenings between north and south. I look forward to my nephew showing me the store on my next visit to SD!
Kudos and cheers!< /text></record>

<rate>3</rate><review>Great fresh water shop.  Cocky, but very knowledgeable staff.  Minus a star for cocky, which might intimidate novice fishermen.  Minus another star for "yes, we carry salt water tackle", when they only have some cursory salt water gear.  Not quite an arsenal, more like a quiver.  This is a predominantly a fresh water tackle shop.</review>< Pics>

<review>Angler's Arsenal is an awesome tackle store! I love visiting Capt. Cassidy to check out his new loot. Baja Fishing Convoys totally recommeds this family owned business!
Eric J. Cummings obviously is so new to fishing that he does not know you to not diss our family. For your information Mr. Cummins, all tackle shops have to watch what they put on the counter. Especially if someone unknown, like you, show up asking to look at stuff. People have walked off with gear in a split second.  Unless you formally apologize and delete your ridiculous review, good luck getting any help from any of us in the industry. You dissed a major veteran in our field. Oh and we dont call it being rude. We call it being salty ya rookie!!!</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80d9571766d86ff9:0x859c751141ae71c2< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Shopping at Angler's Arsenal is the best experience I ever had at a bait & fishing tackle shop and quite possibly one of the best customer service experiences I ever encountered at ANY business! John Jr. and Jon the father and son combo who run Angler's Arsenal and Western Plastics (the company name for their custom plastic lures) are stand-up guys! I came in to Angler's Arsenal this weekend after having a disappointing day at one of the local lakes. I came here in search of some professional fishing guidance and some tackle suggestions. What I received from Jon was on point:* Friendly and more than willing to help answer my questions.* No short answers nor quick 'Yes' responses I've encountered at many other tackle shops.* In depth description of their custom-made plastics (Western Plastics).* Suggestions on bait that is working and how to work them.* I learned that they sell individual plastics which means you can buy onesies and twosies of 4" straight tail worms, 6" curly tail worms, 9" fat worms, 3" craw daddies, 3" flukes, 5" flukes, small frogs, large frogs, etc. etc.  in several color and pattern choices! (This is great because you no longer need to purchase full packs of plastic bait and you can 'sample' various items until you find what you like and what works best at your fishing hole!).I will absolutely be coming back to Angler's Arsenal for most, if not all of my fishing gear needs! Because of my incredible experience this weekend at the shop I will be telling all my friends about how great this place is and recommend they come see John and Jon to get great tackle, excellent service and fishing tips.<//Text>< Name>

Don't take your rod to get refurbished. You'll never get it back. At least not for a year. Now that I finally got it back it's to time to get some gear, somewhere else.<//review>

<date>1622679080846</date><review>4 ft Grind box slides great!  Shipping was pretty painless and customer service is top notch. My only criticism was with the assembly, as it was "simple" but not necessarily easy.  Required more power tools than I anticipated and the project took 3 afternoons to fully finish solo. Highly recommend the brand but just be prepared to put the work in~< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>All around great experience. Order was shipped quickly. The instructions for assembly were clear and easy to follow. Up it put together and ready to go the same afternoon. Everything is really high quality and the skatepaint adds an additional layer for protection. I got the 3ft wife 2ft tall quarter pipe and its perfect for what we were looking for.< /Review><user_name>Kyle Reilly<//user_name>< gmap_id>

The ramp skate paint is game changing. I originally applied it 3 years ago to ensure my ramp would be long lasting. As the wood began to feel a bit soggy, soaking in moisture, I reapplied a layer and now it's much faster again. This is an excellent product.

Note: I also tarp my ramp and recommend you do the same!</Review>

< Review>
The garage ramp came in as promised and its assembly was a piece of cake. The instruction sheet seems to be generic so there are a few things you will have to figure out on your own. I did extended it myself by 8ft with the extra boards that were sent. One downside if that if you require support, you will be on your own: phone calls and emails were never returned. Great product overall and I’m having a blast as a 37yo grown up kid.<//Review>

I have made multiple orders with OC Ramps. Every time, they contacted me quickly and got my order shipped in a timely manner. I might also be one of the only people to ever put skate paint on not only my final layer, but the second to last layer as well. My ramp is going to be super waterproof now! Included pic highlights the second to last layer.< /Text>

Awesome Products! Great quality and easy assembly! Highly recommend getting the skate paint. It's a clear poxy like you would typically see on bar tops. Also, definitely use a drill and you'll be tearing it up in no time!</review>

< Review>
I am a real man I did not need the directions at all. I just needed an impact drill and a case of beer and had my bump ramp put together in no time. I also bought the Huf shoebox. The only complete that I could say would be I wish the edges of the ramp in shoebox made out of a little bit more rigid wood that would take a beating a little bit better. I am satisfied with them. Maybe I’ll add another coat of skate paint.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Built a ramp and got tired of taking the plastic on and off with weather. We re-skinned it with 1/4" and ordered the Skate Paint. Smooth order and got the gallon in about 5 days. We put it on pretty thick and it's a little cold so took a couple of days to dry. Rides great and happy with the finish. Water beads and rolls off. Recommend both OC Ramps and the product.

<Text>Great products. We got a small quarter pipe for my teen for Christmas. I was worried it was too small also worried about the elements since we are in Utah
It is great we can store it between cars in the garage and easily move it around as needed.  The young adults in the neighborhood stop and talk with my son about his board and ramp and give great feedback and comments. They’re impressed with the ramp
It was a great project to build it also sealing it with their board paint was easy. It’s a thick varnish. The hardest part was the weather. We did it all in the garage and ran a space heater to keep it warm enough to dry   Would buy again hope to buy another would recommend to anyone<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8brg94HLVY9mR5faloXVSDLlbdHKPliYbI2p7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4NcqdBdjK9N1RHEIe116ZXWx_zDj9pYX5U64T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
Really proud to have my own 12 foot wide mini ramp with an extension  on my backyard. I tried assembling such thing first time, so It took me a little longer than 6 hours, but still had a lot of fun even during the building process, and the whole family was involve into the process as a cool tram building excise. The materials were well prepared with step by step assembling instruction. They were delivered even faster than expected. Highly recommend even if you haven't built anything yet.</review>

<text>I've bought both a quarter pipe and an 'A-Frame' ramp from OC. The quarterpipe I've had for a year now, and as you see in my photos it's still I'm fantastic shape. My children use it as a slide so it's probably dirtier than it should be, but it's structurly sound and still in fantastic shape.
The A frame ramp is amazing too. The railings are actually quite sturdy, and the ramp itself is extremely solid.
What's even more impressive is the shipping time. I was offered free shipping on both products, and my A frame for example, it came all the way from California to upstate NY WITHIN ONE WEEK!
I was able to build both products alone, and trust me, I'm no mechanic or construction genius.

I'm extremely satisfied with both products from OC. It's worth the money to have your house be the hang out spot for your little skaters.< /text><Name>Justin Briggs<//Name>< gmapID>

<Text>Awesome ramp! We purchased a quarter pipe ramp for use in the front yard. It was easy to set up (about 20 minutes) and we were shredding in no time. Shipping was quick also. We will probably be purchasing the larger quarter-pipe soon. Thanks, OC Ramps!<//Text>< username>

Stoked on my new box from OC Ramps! With work and kids , I don’t really have a lot of extra time to get out in the streets anymore so I decided to get some stuff from OC to set up at the house. The site was easy to navigate, shipping was fast, and everything was included in the box. I will definitely be ordering again from OC ramps in the future.<//Review>

OC ramps came through and delivered my quarter pipe with free shipping and in a timely manner too! I got it all put together in about 30 minutes with help from a friend! I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone wanting to buy a ramp kit!<//text>

Awesome equipment and pretty easy to set up! Im a youth pastor with about 30 kids that love to skate and everyone of them love the new equipment. I think the best part about OC ramps Is there quality work, but also how fast I received my order. Definitely going to reorder from OC Ramps in the near future. Here is some of our students using our new equipment.</review>

<review>Picked up a grind box & kicker from OC Ramps for my kids (and help Daddy relive his glory days). Overall seems like a solid product and appreciate the assembly being painless. While a bit more cumbersome to apply, would recommend the Skate Paint to protect your ramps. Since I have little kids, I dulled down the metal corners which only took a handful of minutes. Sticker bombing ramps are mandatory :)<//review><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd9412480f24f:0x6d8a78689f91ac66<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>OC Ramps is great! We bought the 6' grind box for my son for Christmas. I wanted to support a local business and was able to pick it up in Orange County in person. My son loves it and bought the kicker ramp to add on to it. Looking forward to getting much use out of this. Highly recommend OC Ramps!!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6SIGvB6wo-MN_lpPcXGQdHTqJG_vYwd-aNqCM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I started saving up for the garage mini ramp at the beginning of quarantine and had been so excited about it all year. It definitely did not disappoint! I had a lot of fun building it and am having so much skating it. I was worried the garage size might be a little small but it’s perfect! I still can’t believe there’s just a mini ramp in my back yard. Thanks so much to you guys for offering this to folks!<//review>

I purchased a gallon of skate paint from OC Ramps and it works great! Application was easy and the product meets my expectations.  Before applying skate paint my ramp was unprotected from moisture and a bit to slippery so my son and I would slide out when doing aggressive kick turns. After applying skate paint the ramp took on a nice dark gloss (like a sun tan) and we no longer slide out on aggressive moves! Back to back yard shredding.</review>

Here is my review on OC RAMPS I placed my order on April 1,2021 it is now May 3,2021.
Still have not received my over $3500 Mini ramp. Shipping included? Paid over $250 for shipping to my home. I hoping that I will receive my ramp this week. I wish this was a good review because I am SO excited about my ramp that has now taken over a month which was supposed to be 2-3 weeks because of Covid-19. I know that Covid-19 has effected many businesses. I am a business owner as well so I do understand how things work in our day in age especially through the pandemic. OC Ramps please keep in contact with your customers. Our money is keeping your company  in business. Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>We LOVE our garage mini!!!!  Tyler and Heather at OC Ramps were amazing answering all questions.  The ramp arrived just as promised and my 8 y/o daughter and I were able to put it together in ~ 2 afternoons.  It has been a great bonding experience for us.  Furthermore, during the shutdown it was a great opportunity to teach my daughter how to do a minor construction project.  Thank you OC ramps!!!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM27uk6MwNsBsgtOVPesOsomc6yf9MZdF8ltDoD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjQNxWH_JYab4dwIIzaOGReZ6KGauEJcpyuVMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBuN7i84107xXsDD27BZRZJBvSHXG9Czbd9YgV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBTlkZ-kEhjbLxScT00lXOR2gdOq5LgFsST_AB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPESMCo8fsSr10-xtk172ed4WzOxfGtSVch1Dkx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Amazing product I got a grind box and a kicker they work perfectly together. It came n 6 days which I am still amazed about because of its size. If your looking to purchase one I would highly recommend.</review>

<Text>I bought the garage mini ramp for my 4 year old daughter who has become obsessed with skateboarding over the last year. I’m a union Ironworker who comes home from work very tired and can’t make it to the local skatepark after work, so having a mini ramp in my yard was a no brainer. It was very easy to assemble and came delivered in a nice pallet. I do recommend buying the skate paint and silicone the seams before skatepainting it. (Small/medium shirt, hopefully will fit a 4 year old)</Text>< pictures>

This is the 4th OC ramp we have owned in as many houses. The transitions are perfect and we have been stoked every time we have purchased one. I highly recommend them.<//review>

<review>We LOVE our garage mini!!!!  Tyler and Heather at OC Ramps were amazing answering all questions.  The ramp arrived just as promised and my 8 y/o daughter and I were able to put it together in ~ 2 afternoons.  It has been a great bonding experience for us.  Furthermore, during the shutdown it was a great opportunity to teach my daughter how to do a minor construction project.  Thank you OC ramps!!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcd9412480f24f:0x6d8a78689f91ac66< /Gmap_id><Text>Skate paint review. I’ll start out with the shipping which took less than a week in Covid times. The product is thick and sticky. Applying it took time as I wanted to make sure I got a nice thick coat. The product gave the wood a really nice wet look, think dance floor. My first minor gripe is that per directions product is supposed to be dry in 24 hours. I live at 8000’. When the product was put on it was a typical Colorado summer day with little to no humidity and blue bird sky’s. After 28 hours the product still felt tacky. The product not only made the wood look great but skates great as well. It is fast and will slide if you’re making a hard turn. Second gripe, after two months there is noticeable fading and random spots that the product is/has flaked off. I do keep a tarp on it most times. I will also be adding another coat in the spring so hopefully that will take care of those spots. Overall though great product so far.< /Text><rate>5< /rate>< username>

Got the roll on flat rail for Xmas from my wife. Super fun rail and the 1ft roll on section allows practice/confidence for all types of grinds until you're ready to ollie into them. Rail is very sturdy and with the correct momentum there is no movement of the rail. It is held together by 4 bolts and a insert in the middle so, unless you're slamming excessive force, it's not going to bend on you. I've already spent many hours on the rail and can say it is a lot of fun for all skill levels. A small application of wax will rejuvenate this rail and go a very long way after excessive use. Thanks OC Ramps!</review>

I purchased a Ramp from OC Ramps this Christmas for my son who has been asking for a ramp for quite some time.  I definitely had concerns that a ramp purhcased online would not be a quality ramp.. I was WRONG!  OC Ramps definitely knows how to put out a quality product.  The Lumber that they use is definitely quality and hand picked for a precise fit.  My son and his friends have been on this ramp almost daily since Christmas!  I Highly reccomend OC Ramps if you are looking for a High Quality Ramp.  Thank you OC Ramps!</Text>

I purchased OC Ramps skate paint for my outdoor mini ramp. Amazing product that has coated the ram beautifully and it rides like a dream. The difference between just the wood layer vs the wood covered in OC Ramps skate paint is stark!</Review>

<text>We purchased the mini ramp 3x12x23 ft. OC Ramps was very quick to ship it to our house since we live in the area and were very flexible. The ramp skates great! Lots of fun having this in our backyard and memories from building it. It did take a lot of work and some directions were vague, but we eventually figured it out and it all came together well. We also purchased skate paint. It is extremely sticky and hard to work with (think super glue) but it looks great on the ramp! Gives it a nice shine and rides smoother. We love the black coping and cut out logo on the sides. Very happy with our purchase. Thank you OC Ramps.

Solid quarter pipe with straight forward assembly. Came with the wheels so we can put it away in the garage when we’re done. We still need to put the “skate paint” on it, but otherwise we’re really happy with it. We have a couple smaller, homemade ramps, but I wanted the kids to get comfortable with the curve/slope of a quarter pipe. They already want to get a second one lol.

Had to take 1 star off due to the box at delivery. We almost didn’t accept it, because it was severely beat up and we weren’t sure if we had all the parts. Ultimately, the scuffs from the delivery are minor compared to the scuffs from the skateboards and such. Still happy with the purchase.<//text>

I had the unique challenge of receiving the shipment in the middle of a hot, dry Vegas summer, from the humid climate of Orange county, CA. After letting the materials acclimate, the assembly of the entire ramp took just a few hours over a few days due to the over 110° weather. VERY simple process. I was impressed with the engineering that went into building the transitions and supporting the ramp itself. I did have to make a few cuts to fit the flat bottom panels. The thing I am most impressed with is the Skatepaint. That stuff is seriously from another planet! So amazing. Now that it's all assembled, skating the ramp is the smoothest and most solid experience. Worth the price, hands down no questions. I'll be ordering another gallon of Skatepaint in a year or so! Thanks guys!<//Review>

Newest Garage Mini in Southwest MO!

Just wanted to send a quick thank you to the OC Ramps Team for getting my son's new garage mini out safe and sound! This is his first ramp (and our first time putting one together) and he absolutely loves it! The freight company was great! Your instructions were easy to follow and all the parts were there!! Which doesn't always happen with some kits.

I'm sure we'll be adding to the at home park in the future! Thanks again!!< /review>

<Review>We used skate paint on a new driveway quarter pipe and its working out great.  It was easy to apply and is holding up to daily abuse well.  OC ramps was quick and easy to work with. It was shipped all the way to Michigan in under a week even during the slow shipping COVID times!  Good product, great communication.<//Review>< user_name>

Our new half pipe from OC Ramps is incredible! It looks great and my son is thrilled with the smooth ride.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The setup was a big project and we ended up hiring someone to help - a small expense that made the whole experience easier on all of us.  Highly recommend this company and the high quality product.< /text>

<Review>I love my OC Ramp! It’s been up and running for about a week now, and I can’t stop skating it. Makes this 31 year old feel like he’s 18 again. I ordered the 8ft wide half pipe. It arrived in about 10 days which I was very pleased with. Communication was always great between OC Ramps and the freight company they used to ship it. The ramp went up in 1 weekend, with a three person crew. Directions were easy to follow and it was actually a fun project to build, with an accomplished feeling at the finish line. I honestly could not be more stoked on the ramp. Living in Los Angeles, I’ve been fearful of going street skating or to a skatepark during this whole covid pandemic. So OC Ramps bringing the skatepark to me has been best case scenario. Last thing I’ll say about their ramps, if you’re thinking about buying one, is do it! The materials are great. And with proper care and protection, I’m willing to bet you can make these things last a long time. Thank you OC Ramps!!!!</Review>< pics>

I purchased 2 gallons of skatepaint for my 12ft wide, 5ft tall mini ramp with birch top layer. I set up a tarp to help with leaves falling. The provided tips helped with application, which was pretty straight forward. Skate surface is awesome ! Nice smooth surface that has a great grip and feel for skating. Happy I went with skatepaint instead of other random marine products or paints. After the first all day 10 skater session - it still looks amazing. I applied skate paint with lower temperatures and had a tent which limited airflow. My drying times were a little longer than quoted, but I had 3 dry days to apply and dry and everything worked out great !!<//Review>

< Review>
- Buyer Beware - While OC Ramps does allow returns, there is a lot of hidden costs to the buyer associated with this.  After you pay the shipping and re-stocking fee you aren't left with much and would consider your purchase close to final sale.  I bought a 3' quarter pipe and within 5 days I tried to cancel the order.  The ramp had yet to be delivered, was still up in Orange County, was not yet in transit to San Diego and the freight company had yet to reach out to schedule a delivery date.  I explained to OC my situation and was told I could cancel my order but would be charged shipping and a restocking fee.  Below is what they quoted me.  All said and done I would get $26 back on a $654 purchase.  Something to consider next time you are about to hit that purchase button.

•	Original purchase price - $654.41
•	30% Restocking fee (from product cost only) - $179.70
•	Original ship fee - $224
•	Return ship fee - $224
•	Total refund - $26.71< /Review>

I ordered the bump to stairs for my son for Christmas. Shipping was very quick as was the purchasing portion. It took two of us about 30-40 minutes to fully assemble! Very quick and easy with everything needed to assemble and all very high quality stuff. I was very impressed with the wood and ease of assembly. I will definitely be buying more from OC!< /review>

Skatepaint product works great, cured after 24hrs and has been awesome to ride on.  Put directly on the plywood as my top layer and couldn't be happier.</text>

OC Ramps Rocks...ordered a 12' half pipe for my son, Shipping was exactly as they said, three weeks and it arrived on one big pallet. I had spoken with Tyler before ordering and he was super responsive and got back to me by email right away. Ramp Showed up in good condition, and the putting it together was a breeze with all the pieces pre-cut and pre-drilled. I have a very happy son who's been shredding all day and night for a week!<//review>

<Review>Best mini ramp ever!  I bought this OC Ramp for my son and he can’t stop skating it.  It arrived on time with all material needed, pre fab, and ready to assemble.  The 3ft tall 8ft wide ramp is perfect size to learn on and grow into.  Pro tip: Get the skatelite and a gallon of skate paint for the sides and decks.  Thank you OC Ramps!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Purchased the 8 foot quarter pipe for my 12 year old daughter.  Customer service was responsive and helpful.  It arrived before Christmas as promised, but not without many calls from myself to the shipping company for delivery updates.  Delivery of the ramp did not go as smoothly as expected, as it was delivered by one man and it arrived on a double pallet weighing several hundred pounds.  My husband and daughter built the ramp over two days, but it could have been done in one.  A powerful, fully charged drill is a must.  Definitely requires more than one to assemble.  Followed the included instructions, so assembly was straightforward.  Also purchased two quarts of the skate paint.  Only used one full quart.  However since the weather was cold and damp, it took several days to dry.  The ramp is strong and the quality is great.  Overall, if you're looking for a skate ramp, I recommend checking out OC Ramps.<//Review>

<text>An outdoor ramp in Colorado requires protection from rain, snow and intense sunlight. This product is easy to apply, has a great appearance when applied to raw wood, and provides a smooth, grippy skateable surface with perfect amount of "slip". 1 gallon of Skate Paint sufficiently covered a 12 x 4 ft. ramp with a 5 1/2 ft. extension, including both decks. In order to protect my investment from Colorado's harsh weather and the wear and tear associated with extreme sports, Skate Paint was well worth the price.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ6L7hvFnAjaGR_fq-sBkX0ZzBR-cuYwvmSpD-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>My ramp came out awesome!! The skate paint is the real deal. Take your time applying the paint, it had the consistency of glue and looks wet when it's drying but after about 24 hours it's prime!</Review>< rating>

We ordered a 4 foot ramp for our son for Christmas and was so impressed. The company kept us so informed about shipping and delivery. The ramp came with easy to follow instructions and is of the nicest quality. Our son has loved it and know it will last for years to come. Thank you OC ramps!<//Text>

Very good, slick rail. So easy to setup. Some movement and have to reset it once in a while but very minor. Nice and heavy so not much movement but not too heavy to allow transportation.< /text>

It is really good quality/sturdy but is also lightweight enough to easily move around.  Definitely worth the purchase if you want something that looks nice.  The price is really good considering how much lumber and metal like that cost now, only this one has all the stuff pre-cut for you. I'll be getting the speed bump next!

Got this ramp for my son for Christmas.  He's 14 and has a passion for skating (just wish he had that same passion with his homework).  But I'm glad to see he loves something and committed to learn every day by practicing.  Since Christmas he has been using this ramp almost every day trying to get better.  The quality of the ramp is top notch and I'm very statisfied with the purchase.  I look forward to purchasing more of OC products for my son once winter is over.  Thank you for a great product.< /Text>

Bought the 3’ ramp for my boys. The ramp came with easy to assemble instructions, which were clear and concise. The wood and hardware for the ramp is high quality, and had it put together in about an hour and a half. It came out beautifully.
Perfect transition, smooth, and sturdy. My kids love it, and so do I. Way to go OC Ramps!<//text>

<Review>We love the 3.5” half pipe. The shipping process was seamless and installation not difficult with a few friends to help. My 12 yr olds favorite trick so far is a switch rock to fakie and he says he often finds himself daydreaming about riding the ramp. It even works for BMX bikes although a little tight. Would highly recommend and consider smaller diameter coping or the alternate installation method for beginners.<//Review>< time>

<text>Purchased the Ryan Decenzo’s double step ledge for my son for his birthday. It was easy to assemble. Heavy duty ledge. Hours of fun to be had by all. We have ordered a mini ramp and a rail in the past. Great company to work worth and great quality products.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>The grind box was very sturdy and easy to put together! The railing felt very smooth to grind on every time. The wood is so smooth that you don't have to apply very much wax for boardslides!< /Review>< username>

Very well designed ramp and came with easy to follow instructions. I was also very impressed with the speed at which it was shipped. Only issue I had was I didn't receive enough Screws to attach the top sheet to the ramp. Only thing I can figure was I was sent enough for the smaller ramp. Overall a great experience!<//text>

<Text>The bombmicdigity. This company is absolutely incredible. I ordered the half pipe for my son one week before Christmas and it arrived 4 days after I ordered it and the guy I hired to assemble it said it fit like a glove. A work of art. My son and his friends absolutely love it and skate on it every single day. BOOM! Thank you very much. If you buy a skate ramp somewhere else, you are making a huge mistake.</Text><Time>1548204777370</Time><name>Ron Leonard< /name><user>114675542132593081835</user>< Response>

There isn't any skate ramp/rail co doing it longer or better than OC Ramps. Owner Tyler bleeds passion & drive for the best. Simply put, OC Ramps can't be beat.< /text>

<Text>Bought the Garage Mini Ramp and it fits perfectly in a one car garage! Assembly was as advertised and all I needed was a drill. I would recommend getting the 2nd layer of plywood as well as the Skate Paint.

My daughters and I purchased the 12 ft half pipe for my husband for Christmas. The process, ease of assembly, and the fact that he enjoys it so much made him recently purchase an 8 ft half pipe for an addition. We will continue to purchase from OC Ramps for any future skating needs.</Review>

Bought an 8 ft half pipe for grandchildren for Christmas. Assembly was easy except there were not enough long screws so we had to buy more boxes at Home Depot.
Kids are enjoying it.</Review>

We love the Skate Paint!  Works amazingly well and protects the wood.  My boys love it!  If you are looking to build your own ramp, this is the way to go .<//review>

<review>Awesome product!!!  My husband and two sons built a small half pipe in our backyard.  The first one they built was sealed with a wood sealer that made the ramp slippery and unsafe.  They rebuilt the half pipe and purchased OC skate paint. It was tacky for two days before it fully cured. and WOW!! what a difference!

I took a few hours on a Saturday afternoon and put the 6' wide quarter pipe together with my teenage son. We only used 1 drill and it still went together easily. The one thing that isn't easy to work with is the skate paint. It's an oil based paint so clean up isn't fun - allow at least one extra day dry time than what they recommend.<//Text>

I purchased an 8 foot quarter pipe from OC ramps to skate and ride BMX. The kit arrived in good condition and was packaged up neatly. Instructions were easy to follow but one tip I'd recommend is to pre-set all of the screws by hand before flipping the side boards up. This will save time. It only took me and my 7-year-old son about 4 hours to build. (This includes breaks for drill charging.) It was easy to put together and a very enjoyable bonding experience. During the assembly, I called OC Ramps to double-check on something and Tyler hopped right on the phone with me and helped me out. The ramp looks and feels great -- very stable and solid. Thanks again OC Ramps!<//Review>

We ordered two of the 3' quarters for our non profit to have an all day skate jam. The kids loved them and they stood up to the abuse of 50+ skaters skating them all day long. Plus, they were super easy and quick to assemble.</Review>

Purchased the 6’ grind box as well as the Ryan Decenzo 24k Gold Rail. After taking 15 years off from skating, both of these products are great as they are solid and well built and have helped me get my balance back. The rail is wide and solid enough to be sturdy, even during off center tricks. Great products and a great company.< /text>

<review>Got a GB Kicker for my 4 year old son, and it was so much fun I started skating too!  OC Ramps quality is outstanding, easy to put together, and creates opportunity for our young son to practice with ramps in the safety of our own residence.  He liked it so much we bought a grind box to add to the kicker.  Thanks OC Ramps!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbNACdvz1QcLtySYf11qGM07KDYKtZrRtbLYHo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<Date>1537836586322<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Found OC RAMPS after a search for some good protective paint for my ramp. Luckily I found skate paint which isn't your average epoxy! Not only did it leave my ramp with a nice shine, but it made the wood tougher. Its not slippery and actually creates a little more grip to the ramp. Definitely recommend skate paint!<//text>< Pictures>

My daughters and I purchased the 12 ft half pipe for my husband for Christmas. The process, ease of assembly, and the fact that he enjoys it so much made him recently purchase an 8 ft half pipe for an addition. We will continue to purchase from OC Ramps for any future skating needs.< /text>

We purchased the quarter pipe spine for use at our house. This was a great find and my boys love it. Both have had a great time learning. Easy to assemble and move around. Plus the free shipping just adds to the deal!</review>

the ramp was amazing angle pumps you through and sends you sky high.
so easy to trick over. coping nice shape so it is easy to grind.holes on side make it easy to move but, the weight is just perfect so it doesn't slide. wood is super strong. you can put the ramp through serious abuse and nothing will happen.The instructions need to be made clearer, however.  We figured it out but there is always room to improve.</Text>

MOST UNPROFESSIONAL & TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER ON TOP OF A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!!!!! I would give it negative stars if I could!!! Bought A Half Pipe & I explained to the Owner, Tyler , how it came with all the holes drilled wrong and the pieces of wood were cut unbalanced I had to waste so much money on fixing it and trouble and when I told the owner I wanted a discount for the defective product he sold me. He tried to get me to waste even more money and sell me on a much cheaper rail for half price. When I responded to him that I was not going to waste another penny and insisted that I wanted a discount for my defective and expensive product he just stopped responding and never wrote back. SUPER UNPROFESSIONAL & LACK OF CONSIDERATION !!!!!!! SHOP GATOR RAMPS INSTEAD Or Anywhere else that can be TRUSTED!!!!< /Text>

<Review>Great product that definitely deserves a 5 star. The ramp is easy to assemble and is very portable if carried by two people. It is a very sturdy ramp and works great. I can even make it a hip which is very useful to practice my tricks.<//Review>< pics>

My family surprised me with a grind box from OC Ramps for Father's Day and it has been so fun. They got it shipped extra quick and said the staff were super friendly and helpful. It has been a blast to jump around on with the little groms! The construction is super solid, and we had so much fun that we're shopping for more parts to build our little driveway skatepark.<//text>

My 16 yr old daughter is in Heaven with her new Half-Pipe! She and her friends spend hours together, everyday her skills improve, as well as her confidence, all in the safety of our backyard! We all pitched in to build it, and while it took us a bit longer it was a relatively easy process and we had fun doing it. Thanks for such a wonderful product that my daughter will use and enjoy for years to come!< /text>

Purchased the 6’ grind box as well as the Ryan Decenzo 24k Gold Rail. After taking 15 years off from skating, both of these products are great as they are solid and well built and have helped me get my balance back. The rail is wide and solid enough to be sturdy, even during off center tricks. Great products and a great company.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I purchased an 8 foot quarter pipe from OC ramps to skate and ride BMX. The kit arrived in good condition and was packaged up neatly. Instructions were easy to follow but one tip I'd recommend is to pre-set all of the screws by hand before flipping the side boards up. This will save time. It only took me and my 7-year-old son about 4 hours to build. (This includes breaks for drill charging.) It was easy to put together and a very enjoyable bonding experience. During the assembly, I called OC Ramps to double-check on something and Tyler hopped right on the phone with me and helped me out. The ramp looks and feels great -- very stable and solid. Thanks again OC Ramps!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9pPInVeZzasBZVX2Z3SkJwv_zrGu5h1h3Dqm4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5qxrrBU-4SfYgrSOPgZmnSetVvYCKYe9XxMKp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOldIikoufcuTK3AyG0ToQPD29LTUa1gKhKkBMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_MPP1dX8zXDSOwGmIoKKzM3OmRbO2ggW5cU0g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

We purchased 2 of the 3'2" tall 6' wide quarter pipes and set them up in our garage. We connected the 2 ramps with a layer of plywood and then a layer of hardboard to create a half pipe. We considered purchasing the garage mini-ramp, but the stock dimensions weren't a good fit for our garage and I also wanted to go 1' taller than the mini-ramp. Our kids (and I) love skating this ramp. I highly recommend this ramp and, if you have the space, installing it in your garage...it only takes up 1 parking spot in our garage, and the fact that it's indoors means it gets a ton of usage and does not require weather-proofing.< /review>

It took two people four hours to set up a half pipe in my backyard.  Ramp went together smoothly and easily.  All parts provided were high quality, and instructions were easy to follow.  HIGHLY recommend these guys!</review>

<review>I would like to share my experience and review about my roll on flat rail purchase. I first called to ask questions about the rail and the girl did not know what kind of metal it was made out of and if there was a weight capacity and whats the return period policy or if there was any kind of warranty if I had issues. There was only 2 left in stock so I asked if they would be going on sale soon or if they were going to discontinue this rail. The only thing she could answer is that the last 2 rails are grey and the new ones would be yellow and there would be no sale soon. So I bought it because grey looks more like metal than bright yellow and I wanted it in time for a Christmas gift. Well the rail arrived and the metal flat base platform is bent and I cannot bend it back straight no matter how hard I try with another person. For $360 I wanted it to be perfect and it was shipped with Saran Wrap on it so it arrived damaged. It wobbles and it slides to the side because of it. I wish it was packaged better with reinforcement to the base or in some kind of box. Now if I were to return it. It would definitely be a hassle I can't just load it into a car. The refund would less than my $360. They would deduct about $60 for their Free shipping fee, and on top of that I would have to pay the post office $100 to send it back so now i'm better off keeping it.  I wish she would have gave me the option to buy the new yellow bump rail which comes apart in 4 pieces and they actually send it in a box and did I mention its on sale for $309? The funny thing is when I got this rail it came with a brochure from OC Ramps and they list it for $269. So there is no actual free shipping and I wish she would of let me know about the yellow rail because that would of been a great idea and it probably wouldn't arrived damaged. But she's a sales person and probably doesn't even skate, just saying anything she wants to make a sale. It would of been nice to get the other rail or the option. So now I glued rubber pieces on the bottom of the rail to try stabilize it better. And I get a free T-shirt and stickers for leaving a honest review, Thank you OC RAMPS!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>We purchased 2 OC Ramps in 2016 in honor of our son who loved skateboarding and placed them at our local skatepark. He died by suicide and we help host an annual skate competition at that skatepark called Ham City Jam in EFFINGHAM Illinois. The 2 ramps we had purchased are still in good condition today. They are great products and would recommend them. You can’t really see it good in this picture but the green box is a favorite at the park!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNTxBMvC5InoOcdc2i9PAIIH4AwDQCecK7H28p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

OC Ramps is an awesome company. We just ordered a curb kicker for my son's Birthday. It arrived on time and in excellent condition. It's so sturdy and it's been fun to use around town skating street spots. We ordered a mini ramp last summer and believe me it has been put to good use. Just had our first BBQ of the season and the ramp was a hit as usual. It was well worth the money. We were able to get it put together and start skating in a weekend. Will definitely order from OC ramps again in the future!< /text>

<text>I bought the five foot tall, twelve feet wide halfpipe.  Excellent quality ramp.  Very smooth to skate and easy to assemble.  The wood, plywood and screws that are provided are high quality.  It is durable and withstands adult sessions as well as kids. Thanks for the great product!</text>< Pics>

We purchased a 16' half pipe kit last summer from OC Ramps and we are super pleased with it!  We protect it with skatepaint!   We would highly recommend ordering from OC Ramps if u are building your own ramp!</review>

Purchased 2 gallons of skate paint and it seems to work well. It is a little difficult to put on and it took 2 plus days to cure. I will be purchasing again.<//review>

Excellent rail, very sturdy and easy to transport, its heavy but it really stays still when skating. Great for any level of skateboarding! I’ve tried a few flatbars from other companies and this is the best so far!<//Review>

I purchased a ramp for my son for his birthday. He was thrilled with the ramp from day 1! It is very good quality, he loves the size and durability. I did purchase the paint to preserve it, as it is outdoors most of the time. It has held up well and he is still enjoying it. Ordering and shipping was quick and easy.< /Text>

I bought this ramp for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it!  Honestly I wasn't sure how long it would last with he and his buddies beating on it but I have been amazed at how durable it is. It has been 3+ months of basically daily pounding and we haven't had a single problem. Incredibly impressed with OC Ramps and would recommend to anyone who wants a serious, high end durable skateboard ramp.</Text>

<Review>Love my 3' quarter pipe.  It arrived in less than a week and was easy to assemble.  my buddy and I finished it in about 20 minutes.  I have it set up in my garage and it has been perfect for those late night sessions and getting my mini ramp skills back.  I am happy with how strong it is too.  It has held up really well to my 200lb old ass.  I am definitely looking at getting the 4' quarter pipe in the future.<//Review>< pics>

my son, 10 years old, loves this box. he is a very serious about his skateboarding. he says he and his friends can pick it up and move it easily to create different obstacles. he also loves the height and length. he also says the look of the box is cool. as a parent, i find it to be extremely well made, safe and worth the money.< /review>

OC Ramps was very helpful on the phone when I was ordering. Delivery was fast. We put together the first quarter pipe in 55 minutes and the second one in 45 minutes. Very easy to follow the directions. Our 8 and 10 year old boys were on them immediately. Great fun.< /Text>

We ordered the 8' 1/4 pipe ramp.  I was very happy with the well cured 2x4s and other woods.  It was fun and easy to make.  The ramp is very solid and the transition is smooth and consistent.  Weighing about 350lbs or more the ramp requires 2 adults or adult sized kids to move it.

The scooterists and skateboarders love it!< /review>

<text>We purchased the smaller skate box for our 11 yr old son. He loves it. He is able to move it himself. It is beautifully made. Would recommend, if you are unable/not confident to make one yourself.

It arrived on time, and shipping was affordable for such a large item.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcd9412480f24f:0x6d8a78689f91ac66< /gmapID>< name>

OC Ramps has excellent customer service. They respond promptly and never disappoint! Their products are high quality and professionally built. The warehouse is friendly to all and their special events are tons of fun! Shout out to Tyler Thomas for inviting me to their Halloween party this year which had skate competitions, live bands, endless tacos and cool people to mingle with!</text>

I purchased skate paint for my backyard half pipe from these guys, and they were great to work with!!! I called multiple times to ask questions about types of wood and uses for skate paint and they were always super helpful. Sometimes it took a few times calling before I got an answer but when they answered it was absolutely worth it. Also skate paint is a great product so far. Works as advertised!!<//review>

Not at any fault of OC Ramps as it shows it was shipped by Fed Ex and left on our porch. All in all, great product at a reasonable price and easy to assemble.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I ordered two gallons of Skate Paint from OC Ramps to protect a halfpipe, two quarter pipes, and a grinding box.  The cans arrived faster than expected, but got damaged during transit.  Fortunately, there were no leaks.

The paint went on very smoothly, and I had plenty of coverage with some left over.  It takes about 24 hours to harden, and puts a really nice sheen on the ramps without being slick.

Application was easy and fast, and I highly recommend this stuff.<//Text>< gmapID>

We ordered our son a Quarter Pipe Ramp.  I really like the ramp.  It was fairly easy to build.  One negative feature about the product is the metal plate and how it attaches to the ramp.  It only screws into the outer wall and it will not stay attached.  We've since gone to the hardware store to create a method to secure the metal.<//Text>

<Review>I purchased a 6 foot grind box for my stepson for Christmas. It's seen some serious use since then and so far it holds up excellently, even with all the neigborhood skaters coming over to use it.  The materials are really high quality and everything shipped on time as promised. Shipping was free and very fast, so it was all around a positive experience. Great company, great product.</Review><date>1422652597836</date><resp>None<//resp><Rating>5</Rating>< Name>

My son saved his money for over a year to purchase the two ramps.  After school was out and grades posted; he ordered.  The order was handled properly and the goods arrived ahead of schedule.
The ramps took a couple of hours to build and the materials and instructions were flawless.
My son and his buddy stayed up until 2pm grinding and tricking.  A great summer treat.
Thanks for everything< /Review>

<Date>1537654438817<//Date><rate>5</rate><Text>We found OC ramps after searching for the best way to seal a wood half pipe a friend gave to our autistic son. Our son worked so hard to earn the money to buy a gallon of the Skate Paint. Alas, it did not work and the wood on the deck started to warp. My husband contacted OC and the people who helped him were AMAZING! They reviewed what went wrong and took the time to explain in great detail how to fix the issue. I would have been happy if our experience ended there but the guys went a step further after hearing about our son and how hard he had worked. They sent us a new gallon of paint AND included so many cool stickers that our son has them stuck to everything in the house. I can never thank these guys enough for making my son feel special!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>If you go through this company’s reviews you can tell that more then half their reviews are FAKE. Terrible customer service, they refuse to give me my instructions after I lost them with out my order number. The wood on my mini pipe splintered after 1 year and I was religious about covering it in the winter and painting it with the paint they sell. Don’t buy this garbage my family spent over 6 grand on this ramp that you can make for less then 2.</Review>< Pics>

Fantastic products easy to assemble, very durable.  If your kid loves to skate, this is the first place to try versus some of the cheap knock off ramps and kits.  We have several of these, and will be back for more !!</text>

The box rail came pre-assembled (thank you!) and in excellent condition. We have been skating on it since Christmas. It is sturdy and well-built, but it's not too heavy. My 12 yr-old can move it in and out of the garage without assistance. I feel like it was a great value at the price we paid. It was much more convenient than me trying to gather all the necessary tools and supplies to build one myself. I would definitely buy from OC Ramps again. I'm currently trying to find room in my side yard for a large half-pipe.</Review>

OC Ramps is the bomb about to explode! I ordered a 3.5 x 12 mini-half and I skate that thing at least once a week. It was super easy to put together and the skate-paint along with a tarp, is doing its job so far. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to get their stoke on!< /Review>

We had to assemble the ledge, but the material was quality and easy to do. Boys, and the neighborhood, have been enjoying the OC products.</Review><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

I had some space questions before ordering and the owner Tyler was very helpful on the phone with answering them. The product is great quality and I am satisfied with my purchase!

<review>I recently got back into skating with my nephew after quitting for about 15 year's so i picked up the 6foot grindbox for us and it's great we love it. His friends are always over skating it and some of my old buddy's have come over to skate it. It's really fun i got my grinds and nose slides back skating this box. Thank you OC RAMPS!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Super easy way to build a ramp! Ordered the 3ft quarter pipe. Everything was cut and pre-drilled. I just had to go at it with my cordless screw driver and I was done in about 30min. Rides great!<//review>

I rented some skateboard ramps for a music event and was impressed with the communication and ramp quality at OC Ramps. They presented me with options of renting several styles of ramps and rails. Super stoked on these guys. I'll call you for our next event. I LOVE SKATEBOARDING!< /Text>

<Text>I purchased two quarts of Skate Paint to coat an 8ft wide by 4ft tall quarter pipe I built for my nephews.  My calculations showed one quart would not be enough to cover the entire ramp but with the two quarts I was able to cover the entire ramp and then go over any light spots.  We live in the Pacific Northwest and get our fair share of rain, that being said it is vital to seal the ramp without comprising the integrity of skating surface.  Skate Paint did the trick!  The ramp has gotten an amazing amount of use by all of the kids (and some adults) in the neighborhood and is really holding up to all of the abuse.  The price of the Skate Paint is a good investment considering the cost which goes into building a high-end skate ramp.  I would highly recommend Skate Paint.

In addition to the Skate Paint I would recommend covering the ramp with a tarp if left outside when not in use.  We added casters to our ramp so it can be flipped up and rolled indoors for easy storage during prolonged periods of really nasty weather.  OC Ramps is great!</Text><GmapID>0x80dcd9412480f24f:0x6d8a78689f91ac66< /GmapID><Date>1427833199450<//Date><user>112590329711129593097<//user></record>

I bought a 3' ramp for my son for Christmas. It was great not to have to pay for shipping being that we live in Va. Beach and the OC company is in Cali!  My son was stoked when he opened the box, and he even helped put it together with the easy to follow directions.  I was very pleased with this purchase :-)< /review>

Great ramp - we have a Jordan Hoffart Speed Bump - easy to put together and extremely durable.  Here's a review from one of my sons who uses it:
"This ramp is perfect! It is super durable and fun to use. I really like to use it every day and I can’t wait to get another one."</text>

I am a rollerskater, and i ordered the red grind rail not too long ago, in order to teach myself how to grind. I received my rail within 2 or 3 days! I was pleasantly surprised with such speedy delivery, and I have been very impressed with the quality of the rail. Nothing better than skaters making products for skaters. This company knows what they're doing, and they do it well.< /Review>

I purchased the 6 ft grind box for my son's birthday on 12/27.  He absolutely loves it!  Very sturdy and heavy duty.  I had to call in to ask a few questions and the customer service representative was very friendly and helpful.  I looked for something like this locally but wasn't able to find anything.  The only thing that was disappointing was that I paid for the rush handling which said it would leave the warehouse in 24 hours but it did not.  I ordered on Monday and the email I received said it didn't leave the warehouse until Friday.  It was the week of Christmas so I wasn't surprised but next time, I will skip the rush shipping fee.  Will definitely buy more items from them.</review>

I bought my boys a grind box for Christmas, and they love it. All the neighborhood kids come over and use it - it's so great to see the kids outside playing instead of spending all their time on video games, ha! The grind box is sturdy and heavy and well made. A couple weeks after Christmas, I ordered two curb kickers. When only one arrived, I emailed the company and they promptly apologized for the mistake and mailed the second one free of charge. The curb kickers are too heavy for my boys to move on their own (they are 8 and 11), but I don't mind helping them. It's a great workout for me - and shows how sturdy and well-crafted the curb kickers are. Can't wait to order more products for birthdays and Christmas next year.< /review>

<review>Purchased a 4ft quarter pipe for my 15 year old son.  I was very happy with the transaction.  I had a couple questions before I placed the order and team was very helpful .  I also needed a clarification on directions (on a Saturday) and my call was answered promptly, and they were able to send me an email with the information I needed.  It took my son and I about an hour and half to build it, another half hour to seal it with SkatePaint.  OC Ramps delivered a great product, on time, at a fair price.  I would buy from them again, and I will recommend them to others.  John and Stan in Philadelphia< /review>< pics>

<Text>Man, I can't keep the neighborhood kids out of my driveway! The OC Ramp quarter pipe I purchased for my son's birthday is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving! It has handled skateboards, scooters, and even a couple of BMX bikes! The box arrived quickly and with zero damage, not to mention the shipping was FREE! I'm not the handiest guy in the world and I was able to put that bad-boy together NO PROBLEM! The directions were easy to follow and the quality of the materials is very good! My family is looking forward to giving it some personality with custom artwork. The built in handle holes make it super easy to move from my garage and into the driveway. Don't buy one of those kooky plastic ramps they sell on Amazon! OC Ramps are legit; I am sure you will be stoked with the quality!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Called with just a handful of days before Christmas. I understand that shipping something large can be burdensome and add extra days to the process. I orders the quarter ramp regardless for my son from Santa knowing it wouldn't make it all the way across the US in time. OC Ramps was so kind to act so quickly that not only did it arrive in 2-3 days, but it also gave us enough time to have it put together and under the tree for Christmas morning. Our little man couldn't be happier. Thanks so much!< /text>

I ordered 2 ramps. Great experience! Great product. I actually drove up there the week before Christmas because they were slammed with shipping and they had it waiting for me. My 12 year old son had a blast building them with Dad. The only disappointing thing was that I got no shipping credit for my trouble of driving 3 hours up to retrieve the ramps. Thank you! Plan on buying more, and my son's friends love coming over, are already lobbying their parents for their own.< /text>

We bought a Grind box from OC Ramps as a gift - it came very quickly. Unfortunately, there was a hole in the outer shipment box and something damaged the top wood surface of the Grind Box. I sent an email to OC Ramps - and they IMMEDIATELY responded and then immediately shipped a replacement part (new top) and I got that within 2 days!
Their customer service could not be better!<//Review>

< Review>
This past Christmas I got the signature butter bench and its perfect! its exactly what was shown on the website and it came in right away! The bench was pretty easy to assemble, there was some minor issues putting it together but nothing major and it was ready to skate immediately! If your'e looking for a perfect ledge this is the way to go! Its a little awkward to carry and move around but the bench is solid and wont slip or move around while your skating it.< /Review>

Definitely not impressed by the attention to detail.  lot's of 2x4s sawn right at a knot.  Took some picking and rotating to get good wood facing up.  Philips head screws suck.  Not long enough to get good bite.  We went to hardware and purchased deck screws with torx drive, and the project went much better.  Between the two kits, OC shipped 3 left-sides and one right-side, so one of our OC logos is backwards.  Seeing what it took to get the plywood to conform to the curve,  I find it hightly unlikely that 2 skate moms put one of these together!  For the exorbitant price, OC should pay more attention to detail, provide better quality fasteners, and provide a method to get the plywood to curve.  (We rigged some pipes and banding straps to pull the plywood up into the curve, and used a few of the 3" screws to hold in place so we could sink our 1-5/8 deck screws. )  Overall we give this product 3 stars.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Stoked on my new half pipe. Shipped in no time and easy to assemble. At first I was concerned with the assembly, but got it done in no time and was skating soon after it arrived. Mellow transitions, not too steep, not to gradual.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

I recently bough a quarter pipe and also bought a mini halfpipe and I love both. They are easy to install and are awesome to ride. I strongly recommend OC Ramps to any skater who wants to have the best skateboard ramps, rails, etc.<//Review>

<Review>Last year my 11 years old son order a 3′ Wide Quarterpipe from OC Ramps. I was really surprised how well it was made/designed and how simple it was to assemble! Between him and the neighbor kids it has received almost daily uses and has held up incredibly well!!  He has been so happy with his OC Ramp that he recently ordered the "Jordan Hoffart’s Speed Bump"  to add to his driveway skate park!!  :)< /Review>< Pics>

I was very satisfied with their product services, checkout online was very simple and easy to follow, shipping was very fast with no damage to the product, and their product held up very well on the plywood wood i used it on. I will continue to use skate paint on my future skate ramp projects.</text>

Bought the Hoffart Speed Bump to go with an OC Ramps quarter pipe that we've had for several years.  Very solid piece of kit that went together quickly and easily.  The quarter pipe is holding up very well, despite being kept outdoors and regularly abused by the neighborhood kids.  No reason to think the speed bump won't hold up just as well!<//Review>

Bought the Hoffart Speed Bump to go with an OC Ramps quarter pipe that we've had for several years.  Very solid piece of kit that went together quickly and easily.  The quarter pipe is holding up very well, despite being kept outdoors and regularly abused by the neighborhood kids.  No reason to think the speed bump won't hold up just as well!< /text>

Bump Rail is well constructed and is fun to use; however after skating on it the paint comes off(hard to avoid) leaving an an opportunity for rust when left outside.<//Text>

I bought an OC kicker ramp and box for my son who skates 4-5 hours a day...he loves it and it is standing up to his wear and tear. easy to install and to move (but very stable when he's using it).<//Text>

I purchased Ryan Decenzo's Double Step Ledge and after skating it I am highly impressed. It is a perfect size and it is made of great quality wood and it very resistant to water. I have recommended OC Ramps to several other friends and I know I will definitley continue to do buisness with them in the future<//Text>

I ordered a 3ft. wide 1/4 pipe for my son so that he could skate inside the garage during this El Nino. The ramp arrived within a few days and I was able to assemble it in about half an hour. The materials are first class, and the directions were easy to follow. OC Ramps makes the process easy because they not only supply all the pieces for assembly, but take the most tedious and time consuming process of having to measure  the transition radius and cut the pieces for assembly.

I will be ordering an additional one so that my son can have a 6 ft. wide quarterpipe or a temporary halfpipe during rainy days.

Thank you OC Ramps!</Text>

<text>I got the Skate Paint and painted it on and it works! You can't skate a home made ramp without the stuff.  Id say seal the sides of the wood and bottom as much as you can to repel all water cuz when it rains its gonna get wet. Buy more then less in my opinion< /text>< pics>

We ordered skate paint and it's a bit pricey but so far it's been fantastic on our wooden ramp. I would order again for sure.< /review>

We recently purchased a new OC Ramps Bump To Flat Rail for our skate program. The kids can't get enough of skating the rail and the quality and service from OC Ramps has always been above the rest!

P.S. Had to share a picture of myself taking the OC Ramps Bump To Flat Rail to new heights!</Review>

<Review>Very well made milk tea. However the user interface of the ordering system is confusing. I don't know where I got it wrong but it ended up no sugar at all? I had to ask them to remake for me. The service was great.<//Review>< Name>

Boba here is REALLY GOOD, and at a really great price. However, it's pretty far from my office and is quite a trek to get here. :( The wait was a bit longer than expected for my drinks.</review>

Finally a good Bubble tea spot in SOMA!   Not opened on the evenings or on weekends unfortunately so all of their customers must work in the area.  Tea quality is strong and good.   Bubbles are a bit hard on the chewy scale but still good and sweet.  You can customize sweetness and ice level and there is a loyalty card!  Oolong milk tea is good.</Text>

< Review>
Tea, smoothie and acai bowl venue that is worth a visit.  Have only had their acai bowls but the tea smells amazing in the morning.  Acai bowls are well-priced and reasonably topped (seems to depend on what fruit is available at the time; strawberries, blueberries and blackberries seem to all be possible, at least in the summer).  Perfect stop on the way to/from the train station.  Shop is open by 8am, but boba is only available after 10 (means the boba is fresh and not recycled from the previous day).</Review>

<Date>1488255306450<//Date><rate>3< /rate><Review>I would have never thought to come to this place until my friend looked it up. It’s in a little alleyway with a couple of other shops right off Townsend. It’s a small little place and smells like tea. I got the Peach Milk Tea with boba and normally I’m not a fan of fruit and milk tea together, but this was pretty good. I could taste the authenticity of the tea and also a really good peach flavor that didn’t taste artificial. The boba on the other hand could use some work. It tasted like it was either undercooked or left over from the day before.

Overall, drink was good, boba was not.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Best buck for your dollar! Averaging about $4.50 a cup of boba milk tea (24oz), very strong tea flavor and the consistency of boba was on point. Chewiness and sweetness of tapioca was perfect. Also serves juices, smoothies, yogurt, acai/pitaya bowl.</Review>

I'm glad I came and tried this place out. It's tucked within a side street that I wouldn't normally go down. Searching for an acai bowl place brought me here. The pitaya (dragonfruit) bowl was solid and great for the $8.25 price. The consistency of the bowl was on the watery side so if you like it thicker you could probably ask.

I noticed many people were getting the boba or coffee and chilling at the few small tables outside but don't drink caffeine myself. It smelled good though! Definitely seems like a nice place to relax and chat with a friend or colleague.<//review>

I came by on a Tuesday afternoon around 1pm. There were maybe one or two other people in the store. I ordered an herbal tea with boba. The guy at the counter asked if I meant the hibiscus tea.. I asked if there were other herbal options or just that one. He pointed to the menu and said "well, we have hibiscus tea". I said ok, then sure, that's great. He charged me for the tea and boba.

When he brought me the tea 2-3 minutes later it didn't have boba. I told him I thought I had ordered boba, and his immediate reaction was "you didn't say that". I said ok... and on my hesitation he looked at me for a few seconds, then told me he could grab some from the back if I really wanted. At that point, I felt I was being an inconvenience, so I said no and left.

The tea was alright at best, the service left a bad taste in my mouth, and I certainly didn't need to pay $4 for a cup of tea I could have brewed on my own. Needless to say, I won't be back.

UPDATE: I received a reach out from the owner, Angela, following my bad experience. She apologized and asked me to give them another shot, with a drink on the house. I returned a couple of months later and she welcomed me in, made some great recommendations, and I came away happy. It still wasn't the best tea or boba I've ever had, but it was a solid offering. Changing my rating to 3 stars.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Employees were great, very helpful. First time at this location so I wasn't familiar with the layout and had to go to help desk to locate what I was looking for. Took only a moment and they sent me in the right direction and had someone meet me there, they were very quick to respond and met me halfway. Led me to exactly what I needed. Quick and easy. Very happy with the service, extra appreciated since I happened to be in a rush tonight and I was in and out like it was nothing. Thanks!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Excellent service from Davis on my jitterbug phone. No other location knew nothing about fixing the phone but Davis knew and fixed the problems. I thank your employee Davis. Great job.< /Review>

I told them to get a better job and work somewhere that gives them better pay. They really need to get a new job because they ain’t getting hired anywhere. Those people are living off the government’s money not their own. They probably couldn’t count money if they had to. Never returning to Iraq again.

I hadn't been here in over 2 years but since Fry's recently closed I thought I'd check it out and I was actually surprised at the variety of brands and price levels. I do miss all the inexpensive things you could fill a shopping cart with while spending hours cruising the aisles at Fry's...</text>

< Review>
Went to the Geek Squad to retrieve data off an old dead computer. Called to make an appointment and it was punctual. Everyone was masked and socially distanced.  The young man Josh, who set up my ticket was very knowledgeable, polite and responsive .
So far so good.  I'll update when they return my computer and data.</Review>

Well, the store is clean and fairly well stocked. Its a large building with many sections. However, I needed help finding a product. There were a lot of customers that day. The clerks who weren't occupied with customers were grouped by three or four, chatting with each other. I walked up to them and was ignored. Even when I said, "Excuse me," and waved my hand, they acted like I wasn't there and just kept talking. I left without making a purchase and won't be back.<//Text>

Understaffed due to covid-19, no way to get hold of store if there are any issues. Must  call headoffice or some answering service, make a report on the issue or go back to store in person.< /text>

Didn't find what I was looking for but the staff was super friendly and even explained where else I could look for a cheap toy drone, which they didn't have in stock. Nice to see chain stores with staff as accommodating<//Text>

Realy fast service even with covid hurdles. Really excellent customer service. Was waiting in line and some1 from geek squad area took me to their line instead of waiting in normal line to be taken care of. Thank you! You made my experience so fast and efficient. I was in a hurry and you guys helped me out! Loved the experience. Would recommend this store in san jose area for sure!< /text>

We went early upon opening hour, no crowd and we got what we hoped for, and better.
We even called in advance for particular item and when we arrived details weren't given over phone. It turned out better to actually see the items we considered purchasing.</review>

Terrible curbside pick up. Waited for 40 minutes for order and did not get my item. I had to go in to pick up my item. The employee said the item was already claimed, but when he checked, it was still back there. Someone completed the order without delivering my item to me. Absolute incompetence. Just have your orders shipped.<//review>

<text>This Best Buy location is convenient to where I am at...staff is hit or miss, selection is moderate. I was able to order a replacement S-pen for my phone, pay in advance, and have it shipped to me.  It arrived late...supposed to be to me by Friday; came 9:30pm Saturday. No big deal...just so thrilled to have a stylus again!< /text>< pictures>

We bought a dishwasher at Best Buy in February, but had several issues. When the installer came, he said the copper plumbing is incompatible and the dishwasher doesn't fit (which I do blame myself for not measuring accurately). Coming back to Best Buy, we ordered the correct ADA compliant dishwasher and ready to install in July. The old copper plumbing was replaced and preparation for the dishwasher. When the same installer called me, he saw that the incorrect dishwasher was ordered and we had to wait until August to receive the dishwasher.<//review>

Amazing store. I ordered something online and it did not take me more than 3 minutes to get it and out. Fast and good service. The street entrance gets really busy at some times but the parking it's pretty big. It's easy to find a parking spot available. Amazing customer service, specially really fast if you are in a hurry.< /text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>Store was air conditioned, so that's a plus. Best buy has all the technology you could possibly need. This store is very large and has a geek squad on the left side. I liked the service and look of it, but disliked how overpriced things were. You can easily get things for cheaper at Staples or Amazon. Other than the pricing, a very nice facility.< /review>< Time>

Why would website say available for same day pick up if item isn't available?
Here i am right before they close the store because i never got the email that item was ready to be picked up. THE LAME EXCUSE I GOT WAS SORRY WE HAVE 5000 ORDERS PENDING...LIKE REALLY? Then that means something is wrong with your service and product availability. They canbtake your miney quickly but can't give you your product same day like advertised. SOME TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE or something. Waste of time...not only that I called also and left me on hold for over 30 minutes and they just hung up...what great service....<//text>

Just went today to get my laptop fixed. Unfortunately my laptop will have to be fixed out of store and I needed another computer fast so I decided to upgrade to a pc.

<text>Customer service is awful. Person working in the customer care didn't even listen to what i was saying and just said we dont do price match.. Purchased a Dyson Cyclone V10 animal pro on November 25th 2020 @ $499.00, the price dropped a hundred dollars on November 26th, 2020 and other retailers also had it for $399. So I went to the store on Curtner Ave, San Jose (where I initially made the purchase) and asked for a credit or a price match (was showing $399 on Best buy website). They said they can't do it. The only alternative was to purchase another one (which is now out of stock) and return the original one.<//text><userid>111836948856147841161</userid></record>

<Text>Went in for geek squad and got my headset razor replaced but even better since the replacement wasn't in stock they helped me by upgrading me to the top of the line razor headset. Had to get the warranty again just because it was a different model but great for working with me to get my product right there and then. No wait time but I did go right when they opened. 10am. They wiped down all counters after each customer. Everyone has mask and hand sanitizer at each counter. Felt safe and great customer service!!! Highly recommend<//Text>< Time>

<user_name>RodaleEeOhs C<//user_name><Review>Went into BestBuy at the 181 Curtner Ave. San Jose location Monday 11/23/20 a little before 12PM to return an online order due to wrong item being sent to me. I ordered an iPad Pro 11 128GB but upon opening the package slightly I seen the “32GB” on the box.

So here’s how it went:
Got there and the clerk took my information down but then had to call somebody to authorize it. Comes in Ernesto Ruvalcaba Gonzalez. Looks at the item and says “this is the item you ordered” I preceded to TELL and SHOW him the order # assigned from my BestBuy account online. Not listening to a word I said, he continues “on the item is your order# and this is what you ordered”

Then he prints up the order summary from the item I brought in to return and shows it... First off it wasn’t the order# I gave him, the Person’s name isn’t mines. The address was in South Carolina!

That’s when he finally asked for my name and finally took my order number down. Then he says says “I don’t know how you got this, you shouldn’t have received this item, you were sent this by mistake and yours should be arriving tomorrow,”. Only by basing that on the summary’s deliver by date... I told him this is the package they sent me and that is the wrong item inside..

Then he has the audacity to say “ to me that’s just an envelope”
Not listening to a word I was saying again......are you kidding me??!? The tracking# assigned to the iPad I was supposed to receive is on the envelope..... how is it just an envelope?

Ernesto then takes the iPad and starts walking away. I had to ask him for his card since he didn’t want to give me any confirmation that my order will be delivered “tomorrow”.

Now i'm left without an iPad to return to BestBuy.com via FedEX option online and with a estimated $877 charge on my credit card.<//Review><user>105204967177154433075<//user><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><time>1606464904795<//time></record></dataset><record>

Great store but the clerk's are at the front door and don't ask if you need help, they are to busy talking to each other, do your job... That's exactly what you are getting paid for.< /text>

Instead of having signed parking spot to bring out your product they set up in front to greet you. Five minutes usual wait. Thumbs up.< /Review>

<review>I'm glad I could easily found and shop for all that I wanted in here. The goods were well displayed which makes it easy to find. The store personnel who attended to me was very customer-friendly  and was of great help.

There is option of either paying with cash or credit card.</review>< Pics>

This location is more laid-back than some of the other Best buy locations. Good place for people to go to shop if you have social anxiety. The returned item experiences less intense and they spend more time with you.< /Review>

In the era of Amazon, it's impressive and refreshing that Best Buy has found a way to stay relevant. I visited today to pick up a replacement TV after Amazon shipping broke the first one, and I found prices noticeably better than Amazon on things like smart-home goodies, and TVs of course. Surprisingly, I can say I'll be back!</Text>

It took so long to get help I walked out and didn’t come back for awhile. Best Buy has improved customer service dramatically. Finally! Someone realized that it’s the connection with customers will keep them coming back.
Everywhere I turned there was Best Buy representative asked if I needed help.
I highly recommend the Best Buy on Curtner.</Text></record>

They had a friendly and welcoming atmosphere upon entering. I was asked multiple times if I had been helped. I was there to buy a t.v. When I was being helped by the first person I asked a question he said without hesitation  that he didn't  know the answer but would get someone who did. The person he brought to help me was extremely knowledgeable and explained thoroughly what you get from the different brands at different price points. He helped me pick the one best to suit my needs and advised me when the difference in the newer more expensive model was not worth the extra $ and I wouldn't notice a difference. He helped pick out a sound bar and saved me about $200 by getting a package deal. Great experience!< /review>

Went here to buy a TV. Only 1 person working there as far as I could see. Waited 15 minutes for someone to help me then gave up. Not all bad though, figured out what TV I want. Now I'll order it on Amazon. Need people working there to sell stuff.</review>

<Review>My boyfriend and I came into this Best Buy to purchase a new drone that we had been saving up for. When we got in someone assisted us immediately which was nice because we weren't exactly sure where the drones were located in the store. I believe the man who helped us was Jim, I can't remember, but for the sake of this review we'll call him Jim. Jim showed us the drone we were looking for and even told us about a drone that had previously been opened so we could get an open box discount. Jim helped us out tremendously and we ended up saving some money in the end! I recommend using this store for your next purchase!<//Review>< pictures>

1st time in that location. Nice an old very helpful employees, nice greeting at the door.
I found what we looking for and the employee who assisted me was nice.
Only one thing, she was more interesting in promoting Best Buy guaranty service than explain the product that I looking for.
Guys stop to pushing custumers....
Thank you</Text>

The reason  for this star is because LITERALLY NO ONE was able to help. I went looking for a sound bar asking for info on two I chose and what the differences were and the two guys that "supposedly" helped only told me the difference in price..lol I can see the price tag..customer service is horrible in this location...< /text>

The standard Best Buy experience. Store is set up nicely and finding what you need isn't difficult. There is more than enough parking here and is well lit. My trips here have been normal, nothing extraordinary but also nothing negative at this time.  It does have a public restroom.<//Text>

There was a price discrepancy between the phone carrier activations.  Verizon's was actually more expensive than the unlocked showed online, but after we expressed or frustrations, the manager gave us the the advertised price for unlocked.  We are thankful for good understanding. :)</review>

Well sorted electronics shop. Entrance is wheelchair accessible. The staff was really serviceminded and helped me from the first second I entered the store.  Had a couple of questions and they helped me to choose. Prices are aligned with what you would find in online stores. This would be a good choice to visit if you are in need of some electronics and need help deciding what to buy.

They have the full sortiment of Google and Google nest products.</Review>

<Review>Busy on Sunday after Black Friday, but not too bad. Had an online order and went here to pick it up. Only a couple people in front of me in line, but around a dozen in the returns line. Overall pretty smooth for a busy weekend. No problems with my transaction.</Review>< user>

<text>Customer service in the beginning was Horrible. The person doing returns just walked away from desk. No I will be back or someone will assist you. Nothing. Even one of the ladies there did not know where he went when i asked after 10-15  mins just standing there.  Once they realized he was not coming back ahe jumped in and assisted us. Line was only 4 of us too. Not good.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Went there yesterday to talk to the Geek Squad. They were pretty helpful. Be prepared to leave your computer for a couple of days if you have a major problem. Their service plan is bad if you intend to install appliances and need computer work. I bought all my kitchen appliances there last winter. Very good deals on major brands.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Pretty much the place to go to buy new electronics. Not as wide or specific options as other places but great condition, great financing, and great choices. Not always the best prices but they price match so it doesn't matter.< /Text>

<Text>They seriously need to hire people with better customer service skills! After being ignored by one clerk, I asked another clerk a question, and without saying anything, they walked away. I thought I was supposed to follow them, but they just found someone else to help me, who of course didn't have a clue. So I left.
I gave Best Buy 2 stars because I've had good experiences at other locations.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>This Best Buy is located in The Plant Shopping Center next to PetSmart.  The store is very clean and the employees are friendly and helpful.  I usually visit this store for their video games and an occasional small appliance replacement. I noticed on my last visit that they had specialty shops and services, like Geek Squad, Apple Shop, Microsoft Store, Trade-In and car installation services. I recommend this Best Buy location.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808e3316b820b6ed:0x4161ce5586427bfb</gmap_id></record>

Only issue I had was that they pass you off to each other like it's a game and they try to chat with their customers a little too much.

Seems like most people just yeah yeah yeah. Even after I have explained that I have a 10% discount and some reward points I would to use. But in the end he still charges me the full price with nothing applied. SMH...then he told me to return it tomorrow and re-buy it again with the promotion I had under my account. 😡😡😡<//Text>

<Text>Excelente place and friendly staff, honestly. I do feel like Best Buy and a lot of stores in general have way too much selection for apple phones and not much for anything else. If you don't have an iPhone or Samsung don't bother. But other than that it's definitely an excellent place to shop.< /Text><rate>5</rate>< user_id>

<Text>This location is lazy, unprofessional, and doesn’t give a care about customer service.
I had ordered a dishwasher for my ill grandmother since her dishwasher had been broken for a long time. This was on Sunday the 27th. I was able to schedule an appointment for delivery and installation for October 30th.
Well, the 30th arrived and I get a phone call from the installer, Anthony, stating that he had gone to the store and they didn’t have the dishwasher yet. Looking online, it had showed the appointment was for 8am to 12pm, when in reality, the appointment was actually set for 12pm to 4pm. Anthony said he saw that on his end too, so we could wait a little bit and he would check back with me.
I decided to call 888BESTBUY to try to find out where my order was. After a little bit of digging and calling around, I was assured by a lady over the phone that my order was on the truck and ready for delivery and installation; That the ETA was 2:30pm.
About 2pm, I get a call from Anthony that he was at the store a second time to check on where this dishwasher was. It still was not at the store. He told me that the store was supposed to have called me the night before to let me know so that we weren’t just waiting around all day for an order that was never going to arrive. I never received such a phone call. I let Anthony know that the lady over the phone told me that the delivery and installation was supposed to be in about a half hour, and that everything looked fine on her end.
I decided to call 888BESTBUY again to figure out what the heck was going on.
I got help from a wonderful lady named Sammi, who was able to dig around even more and even contacted Anthony directly as well. They together figured out that the San Jose (Plant location) made a mistake by not contacting me the night before, nor did they contact me the day of. There was absolutely no communication.
Sammi explained to me that when Anthony spoke to the manager, they said that my order was in a different city and they had to fill out a form, which was supposed to have been done the day before when they were supposed to call me anyway. So it’s just more of the whole people not doing their damn job.
Sammi said that I shouldn’t have been able to schedule delivery and installation so soon, that it was supposed to black out certain days.
The only apology I got was from Sammi, who did absolutely nothing wrong. She was actually the one that helped me reschedule for a later date for delivery and installation to make certain we will get our dishwasher.
I am extremely unhappy. I made a trip out of state to California to be here with my grandmother and get a few things done to lighten the load on her. She is very sick and all of this is going to put more stress on her. I am only here for a few days.
I don’t understand why my order isn’t here when it was supposed to be or what exactly happened in general because I never got direct answers. I’m not sure what city the dishwasher is in currently or why.
I feel like someone didn’t do their job and I’m the one paying for it.
Avoid this place at all costs.< /Text>< pictures>

DO NOT BUY COMPUTERS FROM THIS STORE. Went in for a new computer. Ended up getting one and bought windows pro after asking THE COMPUTER SECTION REPRESENTATIVE to have full access to microsoft applications. Except that the computer already had windows 10. I was looking for a different product entirely. WHY WOULD YOU KNOWINGLY SELL ME THE SAME PRODUCT TWICE????? Especially after I JUST TOLD YOU HOW LONG, EXTRA AND HARD I WORKED TO SAVE THE MONEY!!!!! On top of it all, the computer crashed on the 2nd day i owned it!<//text>

I was just picking online order. Should have just bought in store, would have been much faster. Associate helping online order pick up line was way too slow. There were 4 people ahead of me and I had to wait around 20 mins until I was helped. Line kept growing behind me and there were around 15 people behind me. It took them this long to realize that and only then opened additional registers.<//review>

Had a great experience. Bought a fridge here. They had a great selection in their dent and Scratch selection of floor models. JP and Dennis helped me in the appliance section and were very helpful and not pushy. They also got me a great deal. I'll go back here to buy my PS4, just because of the great selection.</Text>

<Text>This location is lazy, unprofessional, and doesn’t give a care about customer service.
I had ordered a dishwasher for my ill grandmother since her dishwasher had been broken for a long time. This was on Sunday the 27th. I was able to schedule an appointment for delivery and installation for October 30th.
Well, the 30th arrived and I get a phone call from the installer, Anthony, stating that he had gone to the store and they didn’t have the dishwasher yet. Looking online, it had showed the appointment was for 8am to 12pm, when in reality, the appointment was actually set for 12pm to 4pm. Anthony said he saw that on his end too, so we could wait a little bit and he would check back with me.
I decided to call 888BESTBUY to try to find out where my order was. After a little bit of digging and calling around, I was assured by a lady over the phone that my order was on the truck and ready for delivery and installation; That the ETA was 2:30pm.
About 2pm, I get a call from Anthony that he was at the store a second time to check on where this dishwasher was. It still was not at the store. He told me that the store was supposed to have called me the night before to let me know so that we weren’t just waiting around all day for an order that was never going to arrive. I never received such a phone call. I let Anthony know that the lady over the phone told me that the delivery and installation was supposed to be in about a half hour, and that everything looked fine on her end.
I decided to call 888BESTBUY again to figure out what the heck was going on.
I got help from a wonderful lady named Sammi, who was able to dig around even more and even contacted Anthony directly as well. They together figured out that the San Jose (Plant location) made a mistake by not contacting me the night before, nor did they contact me the day of. There was absolutely no communication.
Sammi explained to me that when Anthony spoke to the manager, they said that my order was in a different city and they had to fill out a form, which was supposed to have been done the day before when they were supposed to call me anyway. So it’s just more of the whole people not doing their damn job.
Sammi said that I shouldn’t have been able to schedule delivery and installation so soon, that it was supposed to black out certain days.
The only apology I got was from Sammi, who did absolutely nothing wrong. She was actually the one that helped me reschedule for a later date for delivery and installation to make certain we will get our dishwasher.
I am extremely unhappy. I made a trip out of state to California to be here with my grandmother and get a few things done to lighten the load on her. She is very sick and all of this is going to put more stress on her. I am only here for a few days.
I don’t understand why my order isn’t here when it was supposed to be or what exactly happened in general because I never got direct answers. I’m not sure what city the dishwasher is in currently or why.
I feel like someone didn’t do their job and I’m the one paying for it.
Avoid this place at all costs.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I've been going to this best buy for gaming headsets for the past four years. Not only do they have great gaming headsets but they have an excellent two year replacement plan for them.

Just today I returned a headset I had a warranty on and they accepted it and let me put the money of not only the headset but the protection plan towards the new headset I was going to get. It was a fast and easy process and the man helping me was very sweet.

The unfortunate part was they no longer carried the exact same model of headset I am rather fond of, but I was able to easily get help from one of the on floor associates to see if there was any of that headset around at other stores, there wasn't so I went with the next best thing that was closest to the price of the headset I'd gotten.

I highly recommend that if you are someone who goes through a lot of headsets, go to Best Buy and get their two year warranties, an extra $10 or so is worth it in the long run for the expensive headsets< /review>< rate>

Getting real help can be difficult some times. If you know what you want then you'll be fine.  I came to this place once to purchase a smart watch.  I asked an employee get me one which was locked up behind a case.  He said he'll get someone to help.  The employee left and I stood there for 20 minutes.  I decided to leave and ended up buying the watching on Amazon instead.</Text>

<Review>Jeet was very helpful when picking out my "road warrior" document scanner & IPad case.  And the next day Ali was a magician when it came to overcoming a connectivity issue.  Cudo's to them both!!!  All the staff was courteous & helpful.  Good Job everyone 👍<//Review>< Pictures>

The store was well stocked and we'll staffed as Best Buys are. This store had Lots of employees With No Service. We finally found what we were looking for randomly placed in multiple locations. Check-Out was an excruciating wait, with only one person ahead of us and 5 behind us, and the Cashier was very rude. It should not be so hard to give them money. Now I know why #Amazon is doing so well.</text>

Good deals occasionally but most stuff at best buy is overpriced.  This location is not quite as nice as other best buys.  Can be hard to get help or find items due to general lack of organization.  Still good for picking up sale items you might find online.<//text>

We went to McCarthy ranch first and bought a dryer there based on selection we came here and found the dryer we wanted. Better selection. Customer service was great at both locations but selection made us reconsider our original purchase. Return/exchange was hassle free.< /text>

Make sure you check price online again. I want to buy a Dyson V10 absolute and the price tag on the shelf show it's $599 while the bestbuy online showed it's $525. Reason: the price for online store is automatically updated once the administrator update it and the price tag need labor to update them and you might do the purchase before they put the right tag. It's not just best buy, it might happen to all others.</Review>

In store pick ups can become the biggest inconvenience at this location. The computers this best buy uses are slower than a snail and are incapable of getting customer order information. I waited an hour only for them to tell me that my order had not yet passed the "fraud check" after receiving an email telling me the order was waiting for pick up. What in the world is a fraud check for an in store pick up? Incompetent.<//Text>

The moment we asked them a question they had to look it up on their phones and ended up showing us their plans after they Googled it.

< Review>
If all customers receive the same level of customer service that we did I wouldn’t be surprised to see the store go out of business very soon. We went in for an rca cable and knew exactly what we needed and explained to two separate salespeople what we needed. The first was obviously new so I can understand that she didn’t know and asked someone else. She was pleasant enough. The next who was supposed to be an expert brought out something else and when we told him it wasn’t what we needed and explained to him again what we were looking for, he said “I don’t know what you want” and walked away shaking his head. What a coincidence that we went to frys and found exactly what we needed without attitude from someone who obviously doesn’t deserve the job he has.</Review>

The range of products was good. However, I was misled into buying a Chromecast audio for my Google home mini when actually didn't need one. Disappointed!<//text>

<Text>Some of the employees seemed a little standoff-ish but the two gentlemen from electronics that helped me did an excellent job. I don't entirely remember if he introduced himself but he helped me with a purchase of six samsung tablets and cases for a show I was helping out on. Both he and his manager were happy to price match and applied an additional discount to the cases which ended up saving me a solid $200. Thanks guys!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
The place was decent, But!! Some of the staff were too aggressive trying to upsell before they could even close the sale !Went in to buy car stereo speakers,But!,The guy did not know what he was talking about but he kept trying to upsell and shows the most expensive speakers.so we got a quote instead!, went to a place down the road got the same exact speakers & everything done for a fraction of the price including installation!!! Same Exact brand literally everything exactly the same and everything that the guy at Best Buy was trying to upsell and charged extra was basically included with the installation. From the place I found down the road !!!! So for the money we saved went back to Best Buy bought a 70 inch TV open box but as soon as the cash hit the register the same thing started happening so aggressive trying to upsell warrantee,HDMI cables and as soon as I told him I had everything already top-of-the-line HDMI‘s and cord extensions to protect against surges like a pack of hyenas so aggressive. They all kept trying to upsell warranties and 1 guy started trashing the same HDMI cables he was just trying to up-sell me a minute ago!!!!
Too aggressive with the up-sales!!. I used to be in customer service and used to work for a plumbing company so I know exactly their tactics. It almost most seem like they were working for An extra bonus for everything they upsell or even commission! They need to talk to their sales staff during their monthly/biweekly meetings bogus up sales and aggressive tactics to upsell !!!!< /Review>

<text>ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE TO BUY ANYTHING, THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED ON THREE DIFFERENT VISITS IN THE PAST WEEK, WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!

THIS PLACE REALLY NEEDS TO INVEST IN EMPLOYEES WHO ACTUALLY GIVE A DAM ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WANT TO HELP, INSTEAD OF IMPLYING THAT SOMEONE WILL TRY AND LIE AND BEAT THE SYSTEM JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.

I WAS GOING TO SPEND ROUGHLY $3,000 ON MY VISIT THERE TODAY, EVERYTHING WAS IN STOCK BUT THE BOX THE TV WAS IN (ON THE SALES FLOOR) WAS PRETTY MANGLED UP AND THEY SAID THEY WONT RETURN OR REPLACE A TV IF THE SCREEN IS BROKEN. I POINTED OUT THE VERY MANGLED BOX AND THAT IS WHEN I GOT A VERY BAD ATTITUDE FOR SOME STRANGE REASON.

JUST BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN 1 OR 2 PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO MOUNT A TV ON THE WALL WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THE TV ENDED UP FALLING AND CRACKING THE SCREEN DOESNT MEAN THEY SHOULD TALK TO EVERY OTHER SINGLE PERSON IN A VERY DEMEANING MANOR. THESE PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHO THEY ARE TALKING TO WHEN THEY TALK ANY RANDOM PERSON THAT WALKS IN THE DOOR!

WE INSTEAD WENT TO TARGET RIGHT NEXT DOOR OF ALL PLACES, THE ELECTRONICS EMPLOYEE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY AND WE ENDED UP SPENDING A LITTLE OVER $3,000.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I drive 25 miles 1-way to get the excellent service I receive each time I visit. I'm greeted with smiles & courtesy. Today I was assisted by Geek Squad associate NICK who knows more than anyone I've met & he helped me out from a dilemma I've been struggling with for a week on my own.  Without judgement, but rather with helpful clues for the future he quickly assessed the problem & effectively solved the difficulty. I will never go elsewhere for my computer needs or hurdles. Best Buy has helped me out for years when I wanted a Samsung TV & refrigerator too. Their quality is unsurpassed matching the experienced store associates who always have time for me.  I know this young man will go far in his career because of his excellence in delivering service.<//text>

Everything is way over priced here. Especially bluray/DVD movies and cell phone cases. At those prices, you would think that they were made of gold. Last time I was here the employee was trying to pressure me into buying a pair $300 earbuds.< /text>

Good prices the thing I like is that they will sell you an open box items not just rewrapped items that's used and sell it to you  like it's new or something like all the other stores the service is great and the other thing
I like the most about Best buy is that you can get your receipt through email great place good deals and true to there customers.</text>

I said I don't see a dent he look a me and said okay I still can't exchange the laptop. I went over alamden and exchange my laptop. The manager look over the laptop and said I have no ideal where he saw the dent. I will drive the extra miles to shop a best buy. I will no longer be shopping at the curtner site.

The manager of this best buy was rude, mean and unprofessional. All I asked him was if he can knock off a few $ because of a couple of dents in an open box item and he said he could but won't in an unprofessional way and walked away. I discourage people from going to this store.
I hope the management replaces him with someone with more decency.</Text>

stopped selling cd's in July, now the only music media sold is on actual VINYL RECORD ALBUMS! (For the RECORD PLAYERS they sell, I was told...) Records to CD's to Records...Retro-Tech? More like Back-track Tech... (pun intended)
Not too big a selection to choose from, and a little pricey...
They do still carry DVD's & Games.</text>

Very rude!! Horrible customer service!!! I had to look for a representative myself. No one greets or acknoledges customers. I went to buy a cellphone and the offer posted for the cellphone was not honored. Alex the representative said "I think the offer its  expired, let me check." He checked and the offer was expired but very rude ripped the sign. He did not apologize or anything. I asked for the manager and he came to talk to me. He didnt have a name badge and he was rude too!!  I questioned why the sign was there and why alex ripped the sign like that. The manager said it was atts job to remove the signs. Tons of signs were expired in the store. Good luck with weights and measures!! I will take my business somewhere else.< /Text>

Terrible store. I went there to buy a camera and 90% of the display cameras were missing, no staff around to ask questions and customers complaining out loud about how terrible the store is. I even heard one guy tell his friend "why do we have to come to this Best Buy? This is the crappy one."<//Text>

Go to the Santana Row, Almaden or Gilroy locations instead.

Not a complete selection of anything. Half a usual store.

Bad experiences price matching:
1. Refused to price match an open-box item against a new in-box item online. Came back a month later and got the item for even cheaper than I originally tried to price match it.
2. Price match of a phone case on Black Friday was refused, so I went to a different Best Buy a few days later and got the case for even less.

Both times this store lost out on money it would have otherwise made.</review>

On the smaller side for typical Best Buy stores.  Staff is pleasant, parking can be full at times.<//Review>

I decided to use the best buy 18 months interest free financing to purchase about $4200 worth of appliances on november 6th. Delivery was scheduled for november 9th.
I  called back the next day to change the delivery address (forgot to say I am moving from an apartment to my new house), they said since i changed the address the delivery window was no longer available (both addresses about 2.5 miles apart) and would have to be rescheduled.

Rescheduled for the following week between 8-12pm. no one showed up, driver calls to say "oh i have 12-4". I said no, was already on my way to go empty out old apartment, so had to toss all my frozen stuff.
went to best buy, cancelled the transaction and gave them back the free google chrome.
Someone called Angie called and I agreed to get re-delivery on the 24th.
delivery went smooth, no issues. all is well, then I get an  email from best buy credit card (CITI) today and they say "you missed  the first payment on december 2nd so you are charged a late fee" I went ape nuts.

I  dont have a bill yet, how can I be late, I had even written a letter to them saying my purchase date was changed to the 24th not the 6th. they say they only go by the order date, irrespective of wether you actually receive the items.  I refused to pay the late fee, paid the balance off and closed the account.
The one star is for their staff (they were all great) and the products (love my whirlpool washer, dryer and samsung fridge, also got a dyson vaccum cleaner and iphone x).  the entire experience was tedious and stressfull, I had been thinking of making best buy my go-to place for stuff but i think ill stick with amazon.<//Text>

It's saddening to discover the demeanor our Blue Shirts displayed as I, also, would be upset when I didn't get acknowledged. At Best Buy, we value our ability to provide customers with expert service through our friendly and attentive staff. Therefore, we recommend informing the store's leadership on duty immediately once you notice their neglecting behavior. Once made aware, they'll have the opportunity to address their employees of what you experienced. Thank you again for your review and for shopping with us at Best Buy. Have a nice Thursday.\n\nBest Regards,\nBri\nBest Buy Support"}</response><gmap_id>0x808e3316b820b6ed:0x4161ce5586427bfb</gmap_id></record>

<text>Location is a bit hidden in the Mcarthy Ranch area. Being near by the waste business at 237 freeway, I usually walk quick to get into the store because the air reeks really bad and when I would finish shopping, I would rush to my car for the same reason. The place is sometimes dead but, that means usually their products are in stock then. Save yourself some time, call to check if what ever item you want is in stock before driving up there. The service is great, sucks that they can't really help you with credit card issues like increasing the limit, they only can sign you up for it. Citi Bank is the credit issuer towards their store credit card so, look out for that. Till then, their employees are friendly and helpful, sometimes they look like theyre over working for a somewhat empty store.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808e3316b820b6ed:0x4161ce5586427bfb<//gmap_id></record>

Long story long I arrived on bad terms and left on good terms. After coming to the understanding that the warranty for my problem was up to the manufacturer Lenovo and not a liability of Best Buy, the Geek Squad associate Kevin politely informed me that anything that could be done to fix the problem immediately would be over his head, as the problem was with a workstation urgency was present. In steps the General Manager Kellie Adams.

She laid out what Best Buy policies are and being an understanding person I accepted that I bought a low-end computer and we got what we paid for. What she did say was that she would do whatever was in her power to make sure that I walked out that door happy.

The positive attitude of Kevin and Kellie turned me from being someone that did not plan on ever coming back to Best Buy to someone who walked out the door with a purchase of two new workstations. I have a growing company and I know where I will be going for hardware from now on.

It's easy to find the motivation to write a bad review, it takes a lot for me to find it worth my time to write a positive one. If management is reading this take notes.</text>

I hatr the fact that they have a price on the site, and another in the store. If you don't say anything, they will simply charge you the one in the store, that it is higher. If you say anything, they will sell it at the price on the net.</text>

At Best Buy, we strive to carry a wide variety of products to fit our customers' needs and are disheartened to discover our in-store selection didn't house what you were looking for. Myself going through similar situations I, too, can understand products are conveniently available for purchase. We encourage you to visit BestBuy.com or our Best Buy Mobile app where you'll notice a vast selection of products available to order for Store Pickup or Ship-to-Home to prevent any future distress. While on our website, you can also check the current stock of items sold at your local Best Buy locations before you make the trip into the store. Thanks for shopping at our San Jose Best Buy, and we hope to see you again.\n\nBest Regards,\nBri\nBest Buy Support"}</response><gmap_id>0x808e3316b820b6ed:0x4161ce5586427bfb</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Do not buy an appliance from them or at least don't have it installed by them.  I bought a clothes washer last weekend and had it delivered and installed on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, I discovered they hadn't tightened the hoses correctly to the back of the machine and it was slowly leaking all over.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

<Text>I'd give a 0 if I could.  The service is horrendous and unprofessional.  Me and a customer service member were on a phone with a representative, and we were waiting on  the corporate office reps for an answer; the guy with the phone decides to take it off speaker,  walks to the desks at the back for a second and comes back saying "Oh they hung up" forcing me to leave.  Nothing else, I'm like really?  Waste my time and nothing happens.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating><name>Fran Polo<//name>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Bad service in deliveries and facilities, you pay for one service and they give you another, they tell you a date and it is the day that they do not arrive, I am waiting now, and I already regretted buying in this store ... let's see when they feel like it to install my purchases ... and when you call they cannot help you or give explanations of why they could not do it ... and now to wait for them to say when they install it, and it does not matter if it works or not, they tell you and we will have to stop making your plans and I just hope that they tell us 1 day before because they did not notify and I lost the day by waiting ...

(Original)
Mal servicio en entregas e instalaciones,  pagas por un servicio y te dan otro, te dicen una fecha y es día que no llegan, estoy esperando ya, y ya me arrepenti de comprar es esta tienda... a ver cuando les da la gana de instalar mis compras... y cuando llamas no te pueden ayudar ni dar explicaciones de porque no te lo han podido hacer...y ahora a esperar a que digan cuando lo instalan, y no importa si trabajo o no, ellos te dicen y habrá que dejar de hacer tus planes y solo espero que por lo.lenos digan 1 día antes porque no avisaron y perdí el día por esperar...< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Good today if I had a bad experience in your store of best buy plant shopping center. I just wanted to buy a smartwatch from samsung and I asked a salesman if he could give the price of one that was on display ps he did not have what it was worth and the man just told me that "it cost a lot". and I just said ok thanks ps did not give me the price. Then I went with another person and asked him for help and he answered me "a moment please" I said ok. Then the man came back but with another client ignoring me completely. and I told him hey, I just want to know how much a clock costs, he told me again to wait. I agreed, and came back with another client. I got upset and told him I just want to know the price of a smartwatch, you think I do not have to pay you. Maybe I'm arrogant but I do not know how to answer. that they care if it is expensive or cheap they should only limit themselves to do their work and if they do not want to be asked ps put a price on their articles. I had a very bad taste in my mouth this time. and at the end of everything I left very angry that I did not buy anything because nobody wanted to help me. thanks best buy.

(Original)
bueno hoy si tuve una mala experiencia en su tienda de best buy planta shopping center. yo solo quería comprar un smartwatch de samsung y le pregunte a un vendedor que si podía dar el precio de un que estaba en display ps no tenía cuanto valía y el hombre se limitó a decirme que “costaba mucho”. y solo dije ok gracias ps no me dio el precio. después fui con otra persona y le pedí ayuda y me contesto “ un momento por favor” dije ok . luego el hombre volvió pero con otro cliente ignorándome por completo. y le dije oye solo quiero saber cuánto cuesta un reloj , me volvió a decir que lo esperar. accedí, y volvió con otro cliente. me moleste y le dije solo quiero saber el precio de un smartwatch, crees que no tengo conque pagarte. talvez sone prepotente pero no se me hace correcto su forma de contestar. que les importa si es caro o barato ellos solo se deben limitar hacer su trabajo y si no quieren que les pregunten ps pónganle precio a sus artículos. me quede con muy mal sabor de boca esta vez. y al final de todo me salí muy enojada que no compre nada porque nadie me quiso ayudar. gracias best buy.<//review></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It’s a big best buy, but the stuff isn’t very complete. Especially the types of mobile phones are relatively small and there is no sim free style, which is a pity.

(Original)
很大的一家best buy, 但是东西其实不是特别全. 特别是手机种类比较少而且没有sim free的款式, 还挺可惜的.</Review></record>
