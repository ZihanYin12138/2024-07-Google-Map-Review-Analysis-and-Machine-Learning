<Review>I had a super positive experience! I brought in a photo of a super intricate design and the artist who did my nails killed it! Customer service was great - they were straightforward, kind, and the shop was modest but clean! Prices were amazing.</Review>< Response>

The acrylics ended up looking really nice but the guy who did my nails was so rude. The minute I sat down he started trash talking about my friend and I to his coworkers. Throughout the entire process he continued to say mean things about me in Vietnamese but my friend understood it. He also was very rough and when I told him the way he was buffing my nails hurt he just went even harder. He ended up charging me $90 for a simple design and not that long of a length. I got a very similar length and design at another salon and she only charged me $40. This man was straight up disrespectful and I am never going back again.</review>

<text>I’ve been coming here for many years and I’m usually quite pleased with their work. However this time I got a newer nail tech who might not be as well trained as the others. Not only did he not do the coffin shape that I wanted but all of my nails look as if they were applied at an angle facing up. When I mentioned this to him he got upset & started talking in a different language to his coworkers & had an attitude when I had him fix one of my nails that looked the worst. I felt very uncomfortable, paid and left. Never again will I be visiting this salon for this overpriced service when they have nail techs that don’t know what they’re doing.<//text></record>

The service wasnot terrible. But the quality was lacking. My gel manicure has many bumps in it. And is already peeling. The UV lamp looked dirty inside. I recommend anywhere else.</text>

My manicurist never really spoke to me, however he spoke to his coworkers in his language. I find this to be rude.

<review>As a first-time customer I was very impressed there was a big line and and it seems pretty busy it was an hour before closing and they still managed to take everyone. Great customer service also very attentive to the details in your nails not like other nail salons that leave out corners leave bubbles in your nails or just an uneven coat I can literally say this place is almost perfect. I payed $34 for gel extensions btw great price!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I love the way my nail are done. The Brothers are good. The only thing I have had issues with is they sometimes don't acknowledge you once they ask if they can help u. They don't say ok it will be so long of a wait, they just leave u sitting there for a good minute. It's happened to me more than once so I would just walk out and they never notice or try and get someone to help me @ least to inform me of the wait time I'm looking at.< /Text>

Mixed experiences when it comes down to getting my nails done at The Brothers. Usually, my nails come out exactly how I want them. I only had one issue was with how my black matte nails peeled after a week. Other than that it's a decent place...oh one last thing! Always, always, always set up an appointment if you do NOT want to wait!<//text>

<text>Beautiful long-lasting nails. The wait time is a little long because of all the business they have coming in, I now recommend making an appointment or going in, first thing in the morning. Henry's done my nails everytime I've gone in and does a really great job every time. Ken also does a wonderful job on the marble nails, which my sister had gotten. This is now my go-to place.<//text>< pictures>

This was my go to nail place, and I know 20+ girls who go here and all love it. Eric, Ken, Kevin 👌👌 great at their art.  But I finally had a bad experience, and I'm afraid ill never go back. My nails started separating from their nail beds. I never had this happen before in the 6 full months that I started getting acrylics there. I went in for a fill, and when my polish came off I could see the damage, and you could tell he panicked as well. He started to file the inside of my nail, like under, and put super glue under my nails. Instead of helping me by suggesting I take them off and let them heal. He covered it up. I later googled it, and was horrified to find out this is common when using illegal product to make the acrylic. Someone people have a reaction, some don't. Or long periods of use can cause it as well when it comes to this illegal cheap product. I wish they didn't take advantage of their loyal paying customers. But it is what it is. Choose your nail place wisely ladies.< /review>

<review>I got the worst manicure ever here. I’ve been going to this nail salon many times for acrylics but recently was able to grow my own nails and get gel manicures instead. The woman that did it charged me $37 for my mani, which later on I found out manis are $27. Smh. At first my mani looked very pretty and left relatively happy, she didn’t actually do a manicure with cuticle removal or nothing like that, pretty much paid that much to just get my nails painted and only to go back 2 days later because the gel chipped and my nails broke. Erick was a bit helpful and tried to fix them with dots of acrylic but did such a messy job. I asked them to clean up the weird chunks of acrylic around and under my nails and for thicker gel so my natural nails wouldn’t break again and the woman, Eric and the chubby guy with a manbun all had an attitude about it. My nails are lumpy from the horrible acrylic job and the gel that they just applied without distributing and curing in between layers. They are very friendly when you walk in there dropping $50 on a set of acrylics but when you ask them to fix something they treat you like this. NOT COOL. They lost my business! I was spending around $200 a month with them in the past 3 months I started going there. Hopefully they treat their unsatisfied costumers better.<//review>< pics>

< review>
Worst! They have so many customers and it is without appointments so wating is forever. I waited for 45 mints. Kevin did my nails and while doing it he went 7 times to help other customers or to pickup the phone. Worst thing was other lady came and was talking in her language and laughing on my nails because I choose pink and white color. Also he didn’t even finish doing my nails and he was in too much hurry because he was having so many customers. Do not recommend for the price very high. The lady who did my pedicure was nancy she is really good but same she was in hurry so did everything very fast. Worst experience. Also I did my eyebrows worst please please never go for eyebrows wax to them please they burn my whole skin they are not professional.<//review>

Worse service ever, was there for 2 hours, got skipped 5 times and wasn't even acknowledged, for a minute I felt as tho I was invisible! After all that time I just could not take it anymore and got up and left. I give it one star because is the minimum I can do but wish they had a zero star rating because that's what I would give this place!!!</Review>

If I didn’t have too select a star to get started on writing a review I would ont put any stars ! I had an appointment at 12 noon with Nick and it was 12:45 and knowone was coming up to me to help me or acknowledge me . I felt that was rude unprofessional and a waste of my time which I have scheduled my day so I can be ready for my banquet tonight . Wouldn’t recommend to come here too many workers and no customer service what’s so ever .</text>

Long wait and not sanitary
Wasn’t happy with my pedicure
The polish is on my skin my nails are cut uneven
I honestly could have done a better job myself
And the woman looked upset with me because I asked her to fix what I didn’t like

Heard a lot of amazing things about this salon so I was pretty disappointed
Wish I could post a picture so you can see I’m not being dramatic at all

My little sister can paint my nails better< /Review>

<Review>It's a small pretty place, they offer a limited variety in sweets, each of them delicious. I tried the Turkish delight sampler plate, lemoncello mascarpone slice and pistachio baklava. The lemoncello slice had the perfect melt in the mouth texture and good flavor. The Turkish delights were dainty, have excellant flavors and not overly sweet. Baklava was quite fresh, not the best though. Friendly staff, offered me the turmeric immunity shot to try which was quite good.< /Review></record>

So we stopped in at this place I say stopped in we drove all the way from Santa Cruz to find it. Just for its Turkish delight, and we were not disappointed it was crazy good, and they had good Turkish coffee, all in all it was just a very very great experience, incredible ambience, whoever set the store up made it simple but nice you can sit outside or inside, there places to eat all around it and you can come here for dessert because it is the best dessert I have ever had in my entire life I am not kidding I don't know why have never heard or had Turkish delight I'm 57 years old and for some reason I've just never had it. Well I'll be having a lot of it now a little at a time. The people were friendly and you can tell they make their desserts with their heart and soul, because they're so intricate and delicate I just can't believe there's Turkish delight out there I love it I love it I love it I can't say much more than that but I'll leave some pictures and if you see this on the page you should go try it out you will not be disappointed.</text>< Pics>

It is good to be courteous to people. If you decided to close the store, then edit your page on Google. This place is close!</Text>

The change in ownership has definitely brought this place down. Very limited selection, stale pastries. Will miss the old place.<//Text>< Pictures>

I live close to this bakery but just visited and checked it out today. They have both traditional/American and Turkish pastries. Love all their goods that I got! Will come back more often for sure.< /Review>

I have bought some dessert today. There was a lady in cashier. She packed what I ask for and also charged me and I paid the bill via card.
But when I arrived home I checked that she did not put 2 piece of cake in my bag. I called to Lillian but they said the number is not working. How can I get back my money for missing pieces of cake??? There is no way to contact with them.</Text>

Great place with Turkish, Persian and French pastries. Big variety of hard rolled Turkish delights. They have nice gift sets. Good coffee but no real cups unfortunately</Review>

<review>Charming place.  You have to try the Natural Delights with Rose petals.  The aroma before you take a bite is intoxicating!  I also had the chai Tea Latte - very light and aromatic.

Nice mellow vibe, just what a confectionery/coffee shop should have.</review><response>None<//response><user_name>Madhan Ramachandran</user_name><Time>1499778866622</Time><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONRYt9lGYTjH-b8DRF-HrUvC-pqKgITa0cGxSK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN_R24-PwO7jbkNj6i5Opt_XX9fJu-DnPo7d0m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< GmapID>

Horroble first experience.
Ordered hot chocolate kids temp for my 3 year old god daughter. I tested it and it burn my mouth so bad.
Asked 3 times if a dessert had nuts, never got an answer.  Hope i dont get an allergic reaction.
And the phone number is wrong.</Review>

She had finally arrived from the back but customer service was very poor. I did not feel welcomed. I had asked about the ingredients of some items and she did not know her response was in a rude tone "what does the label say, its pistachio" "I don't know these items are imported OK!" I was shocked because surely the pistachio pastry is not just pistachio, I wanted to know what other flavors I will be getting. Server did not know the product and was very rude and unwelcoming. I will not be wasting my money here and you shouldn't either. Please support kind businesses, this is not one of them.</text><user>101330038619415903856</user><Time>1571939379773</Time>< Rating>

Yea, pastries are number one in the area, coffee is perfect and I love their ice-cream.
Coffee lovers will taste the difference.
The pastries are from one of the most well known confectioners in Bay Area. It's fresh and unique.
You can order the most beautiful cakes here. I ordered my son and my wife's birthday cakes here.
Just give it a try, you won't regret.</Text>< user>

<Review>Pastries are really good. We bought a couple of different ones, and all of them tasted good. Also as others already mentioned, nothing was too sweet. Red velvet pastry was outstanding, one of the best I have ever had. Loved it! Tiramisu is another must try here.</Review>< Gmap_id>

We ordered birthday cakes and it was absolutely amazing. Everyone loved it. Just make sure to talk to the manager as the person who might pick up the phone sometimes is not able to provide a lot of information. Also, if one needs to have more decorations on the cake they would do it. The quality of the cake is amazing, so is their persian sweets that one can buy from the shop.</review>

Love the cappuccino.  This small pastry shop & cafe opened about three months ago.  We were just chatting about how this newer shopping center needed a good coffee shop.  Well, it's here!  We tried the Persian Saffron tea and loved it as well.<//review>

Really dry and chewy desserts. Probably not fresh on the day I went. Flavours were good, but the texture just wasn't appealing.<//Review>

I like their pastries a lot. Probably one of the best in the bay area, but this branch has a smaller variety of pastries compared to their Campbell branch.< /review>

I almost never give 5 stars. I would have given 4 stars but it took more than 24hrs to get an estimate for work. If I had received an estimate within 24hrs or less of dropping off my car I would have give 4-5 stars. Other than that Doc Auto does good work. Their paper process has gotten slower this year since the corporate changes. Hopefully the paperwork process will catch up with the mechanics soon.<//review>

<Name>Bruce Schumm</Name><review>Thanks for fitting me in at very short notice. Your interface with the customer is by far the best I've come across in the business (although I'll admit it's been several years since I've used a general-service mechanic since my car has very luckily been behaving very well). But I can say without qualification that I found you to be knowledgeable, capable, and exceedingly amiable!<//review>< Rating>

Doc Auto was fantastic! I was helped mostly by Eric who was super friendly and great! I was super stressed having my car breakdown in the middle of school and work and they diagnosed it and got it all setup with the dealership for repair, and for a good price. I would recommend them over any place I've been to in SC.</Text>

Called just to check if AAA took care of the issue after AAA had put in a tow order just in case my car wouldn't start off a jump.

During phone call, Ken gave me a generous explanation and recommendation of what to check on my starter and starter wires. He offered a Starting and Charging test for $60ish. If that's standard, than this guy is to be trusted.

Thanks Ken</Review>

<Text>I was very fortunate to have my car serviced and returned to me by the end of my work shift.  This shop was very professional and to the point.  The only person I dealt with, Phil, was calm, reassuring, and knowledgeable.  I can say that it would have been more reassuring to have a breakdown of costs before accepting the work.  For example: the per hour cost for labor and the breakdown cost for materials and parts.  I was desperate and could only agree to whatever I was quoted hoping that I was not being ripped off.  This was not the case and this shop did a superb job.  Thank You, thank you, thank you!

I will definitely recommend your shop to family and friends!<//Text>< time>

I love that every time I walk in, the desk is busy - I take that as a sign of confidence in Doc Auto from the community. The work has been done on time and as far as I can tell, the quotes & final bill amounts are fair. The customer service is excellent, hence the five stars. Thanks!</text>

Brought my car in for right brake light repair, worked for about a week, then had to bring it in again due to both brake lights being out, worked for about 5 hours. Now, I'm never going back again because they have poor customer service and do not do their job. When you pay someone to fix your car, it shouldn't have to be brought in three times to 'see what the problem is'. It should be fixed!!<//Text>

Doc Auto has great customer service, I always feel very well taken care of when I take my car in. I also really appreciate that the technicians here take the time to explain what is going on with my vehicle, it helps me to be a better car owner and makes me much more inclined to continue taking my car to Doc Auto in the future.< /text>

<Text>Hello my name is Tim. I have had the worst experience with doc auto specifically KEN THE OWNER and eric the service writer. I have a 2006 Ford F250 6.0 power stroke. The truck was torn down to the injectors and in pieces on the driver side.  I called Doc auto, spoke with Eric the service writer whom might I add has never turned a wrench on a vehicle he said bring it on in. I was told the job would take one to two weeks, my truck was at the shop for a month and a half.  So Eric gave the job to Nick the tech. Nick started on the Job and it seemed like every other day I was getting a phone call from Eric with problems and updates. After dealing with a month And a half of headache from Eric,I got a phone call from  Nick the tech he said your truck has oil coolant and fuel pouring out of the tailpipe I think you have a cracked head or blown head gasket.  I’ paid $3000 to get my truck out of the shop with blown head gaskets and a cracked head.  Now I am in the middle of doing the whole job myself and I am coming across the aftermath of some very poor quality work. Such as Stripped injector holddown bolts, broken injector clips broken trim pieces. And broken or missing Christmas trees( the little plastic pieces that hold trim and wire looms in their deadicated places.).  I went in to speak with KEN THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY. I brought him the stripped injector holddown bolts. KEN THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY told me that those bolts were fine. I asked KEN to see if he could simply replace The injector holddown bolts that had been horbated while at his shop. He said I will not give you any money,pointed at the door and said there’s the door now use it and leave. I was in utter disbelief as to how I was just treated. So I politely told him to have a nice rest of his day and left. KEN SPOKE TO ME AS IF A WERE A CHILD AND WITH LITTLE RESPECT.  Thanks for reading hopefully this saves someone headache, hassle and money.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have been using these guys about a two  years and they started off Ok .
But I am noticing a trend . They should be wearing clown suits and carring shotgiunsbecause that is there current approach. For a wheel bearing they repalced the whole Hub assembly .
For a vibration problem I was having they replaced the steeting rack . The problem was
a cheap CV axel they had replaced two years ago. When I examined that part is was
old and rusty and factory one that was still in place wasn't and had a counter balance on thte
new part didn't.  For a oil leak they basically shotgunned every gasket except the on that failed
and I had to take it back in because there was still a puddle of fresh oil on the same spot
on the engine, Also twice they recorded the wrong milage on the receipt. And were kind of indigent
when I insisted that it be change to the proper millage out.
Also they are high priced which I figured was Ok if they did a good job
and used good parts but it ain't happening for me at this place.< /text>

Ended up getting a $1500 bill for a crankcase relief valve or something like that. Took the car on a trip the weekend afterwards and it started acting up. Called and left a msg regarding the tranny service I had originally asked for. Was told that BMW never need a tranny service.
I explained what was happening and he said that they'd get the car down to their shop and look at it. Here it is 3 weeks later and no contact and no return of calls and the car is not safe to drive. $1500 for nothing because it still leaks oil, which I was told that the original repair would correct......<//text>< Pics>

Company rep informed me I needed to extensive work including both oxygen sensors and a transmission fluid flush. Estimate came out to be around 850. Doc Auto is unfairly priced and their employees exaggerate the conditions of vehicles in order for customers to commit to work on that day and time.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Rupert Garcia<//Name><response>None</response>< user_id>

Excellent customer service. Good quality work. Just had a Flowmaster muffler installed. Same day service with quality work. I will definitely use them again when I get my lift kit installed and for other future builds. Very fair pricing too. Highly recommend.< /text>

Took my 2018 charger 392 in today i needed some mufflers welded in 3-23-21. Arrived at 11am, Steve let me know he was slammed with 12+ cars and already fully booked for the day. Only two guys working, He still took care of me and got my car done by closing! Thats customer service at its finest! Hats off!</review>

The only shop I trust in Fresno. Steve is a great guy and an honest mechanic. He and his team do excellent work and get your vehicle in and out quickly. My family has been doing business with them for years. 100% recommended for off-roaders and custom cars.< /Text>

<text>Came in about a two weeks ago to looking to wake my truck up a little. Said that I wanted the exhaust to have a moderate tone and man did this shop deliver! Two hours later you can actually hear the V8 and for a fraction the cost of all these new online exhausts. Super excited about the quality and professionalism from this shop, will be coming back whenever I want to get work done to my truck< /text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I have a 2020 gmc at4 with the 3.0 diesel and I was told by a lot of other local shops they couldn’t put a lift on my truck blah blah blah. Do to being too new , well Steve got it done in 2days!!  It rubbed slightly when I picked it up and the guy working ( Justin I believe his name is) took his time on fixing the issue even though he was close closing shop and being the only guy there.   To me that says Lot he could have said comeback on Monday ( being it was Saturday 5/30/20)  it took 3 attempts to get it right and that’s exactly what he did.
So guys at west coast thank you!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Steve and Josh are the most amazing, honest, hard workers who will go the extra distance to make sure they put you back on the road safely. Very thorough. Quality work. Best pricing. Go shop around. You'll see. Reserve ahead of time as their schedule fills fast! People dont stop coming! That should say something in itself.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!!
I've been using these guys for a decade and they've never failed to come through with exactly what I needed and at a better price than anyone in the valley. Catalytic converters, mufflers, tailpipes, and customs. They've also gone the extra mile and taken care of a few little things I needed like pipe hanger reattachment and trimmed the damaged tail pipe from a high speed tire blowout at no extra charge.

Took little longer but that's to be expected when it comes to cars getting worked on and don't believe sticker price on window ,but they are cheapest in town for mufflers and looked round and my catalist converter here they say starts off at $99 my bill out the door was $320 for 1. Small wait room no windows hot in there but friendly staff .👌< /Text>

Got my Roush Axle Back Exhaust System with Resonator Delete and X-Pipe Installed today on my 2017 Mustang GT 5.0 and it’s soooo nice and loud. These guys are fast, efficient and know what they are doing. I’m glad I listened to all of my friends and went to West Coan Customs. Tito took care of me!! Great place I will be back<//review>

<Name>TNK Photo<//Name><review>Beautiful venue, very pretty grounds and the staff was super accommodating. Absolutely love photographing a wedding here last week. The couple I know was just as happy and everything being there was super convenient. When we were doing detail photos around the venue even the members were all super nice and helpful not getting in shots and all super happy to be there. Definitely a very pleasant experience<//review>< gmap_id>

Nice venue for a wedding but it was not set up with handrails and such for people like my husband and I who are both disabled and should be inspected. Fortunately there was an employee who drove the Bride & Groom up and down the hill who agreed to drive us when needed.< /review>

<review>The course was in immaculate condition and greens were like lighting!  Nice little pro shop
The warm up facilities were outstanding! The day started a little foggy but soon the sun made its appearance. Challenging course and definitely  in my top 5 courses.  I had a hamburger that was very good with all the trimmings.</review>< Pics>

Good course, have played only as a guest several times when the actual club house is closed on Mondays.  So can't comment on anything else but the golf course.  But the course is challenging enough and in great shape, so would recommend playing there.<//Text>

<Review>It is a beautiful setting but unfortunately there were certain things that were not represented correctly to us.  First, we were told that the venue had a relationship with three nearby hotels that would provide shuttle service for our guests.  The shuttles were only available to transport less than half our guests that had rooms.  Lomas Santa Fe was no help in this issue.  We spent an additional $325 on transportation.  Secondly, The food that we taste tested was not made by the same chef on the day of the wedding as he had quit.  We were not informed of this change.  The food was cold and bland.  Thirdly, ten days after our event the wedding coordinator contacted our daughter, the bride, to present an additional bill for drinks supposedly provided during the day as the wedding party got ready.  It would have been better to know of this at the time of service so we could understand what we are paying for.  At this time I have no idea if we received the drinks or not.

Lastly, I suppose that I am old fashion, but I do not like to be forced into paying a gratuity without regard for the quality of service.  It should be earned not expected.  It seems every venue does this, 21% gratuity which is also taxed, just beware to read the small print.< /Review>< GmapID>

We are members at Lomas, and love the club!  It is very friendly,  and the course is beautiful, always in great shape.  It's close to the ocean, so seldom is hot, plus has some great views.  We also enjoy the pool and exercise facilities.</text>

I can not tell you how many times I walk up the 9th with my kids as the sun is setting  and say to myself what a great place.

Very good golf, strong tennis a pool and gym.  Nate and Josh run a great junior golf program.  My sons love playing the other clubs and Lomas has a pretty strong team.

Now the club is not perfect, it is looking a bit old and if you are expect high end atmosphere, facilities and service, you may wish to look a few miles east and south east...  But if there reason you join a club is to play good golf and tennis... you should consider this club.<//Review>

<text>Nice track, the course was in grat shape and the greens were very consistent. The only negative is high power lines come into play on 2 holes.
I would go back!</text>< pictures>

<text>It is a private country club you can visit and see how friendly and service oriented they are. Beautiful golf cpurse, 14 tennis cpurts, 4 pickleball cpurts, beautiful outdoor pool, and all the amenities. As well as great member dining and a patio bar over looking the Course and the ocean!< /text>< Pictures>

Lomas Santa Fe Country Club has the most polite staff  and has always been very accommodating to me.  The facilities are the BEST one can find.  I have had an opportunity to be at a wedding at LSF that was just incredible.  The view is nothing short of spectacular.  If you want to have a function that is upscale LSF is your ticket!  I have, with any reservations recommended LSF to all my family and friends.

We just had our wedding reception at LSFCC and I wish I could give 10 stars. Everyone we worked with was fabulous. Krissi and Chelsi are so personable and aim to make your day everything you imagine it to be. They responded quickly to all of our emails, shared their design and wedding expertise and even added their great senses of humor.  This is a gem of a place. All of their vendors are fabulous and so professional (Sweet Cheeks Bakery and The Flower Shop Encinitas). I can't say enough good things about LSFCC.
The food was delicious. We went the stations route and all of our guests loved that they could mix and mingle and go back for 2nds and 3rds. David, food and beverage, was so easy to work with and willing to make adjustments to the menu to fit our taste.
Book now!< /Review>

I have worked here for coming up on two years now. But I have been coming here for about a decade. Really truly is a tight-knit family. The absolute best price drinks in Chico. 22 oz Sierra Nevada for $4... You just can't beat that. 22 oz Bud Bud Light or Coors Light 350. You can't beat that I love working there watching letter games with my friends and family and hanging out with my girl for a night on Burger night. During quarantine I miss cooking the burgers so much, but I know once we are allowed we will be back in full force. I love thee oh, I love the prices, and you cannot beat the pool tables. Hands down best in Chico<//text>

Friendly crowd. Great place to shoot pool and find experienced players.

Drinks are heavy and food is good, but kitchen closes at 10.

Many tables and great place to chill right next to Chico State.<//review>

<username>Leslie Mead<//username><text>The food is outstanding... that was a unexpected bonus for sure.  Haven't had anything yet I didn't like.  The pool tables and more importantly the pool cues/sticks are above average & in good condition.   The drinks are reasonable and all in all just a fun casual place to go.
Tables are regulation though so if your used to playing on a bar size table this isn't it.  Although there is a smaller one at the front of the bar.  Pretty much a sports bar where regulars & pool players go after work.  Karaoke  night and Marlene the host are top notch.  She knows her stuff and has quite a following of regulars.  She makes all the singer's have fun and it shows.  Plus she can sing herself so    that's always nice.  Definitely worth checking out when in the area.</text></record></dataset><record>

I only rate 3 stars because they say food is served until 9:00 pm. I haven't been here in a little while and so I brought a friend with me so we can shoot some pool. My friend was hungry and we arrived inside at 8:50 pm and we asked what time do they stop serving food. We were told 9:00 pm. There was a lady in the kitchen and the bartender asked her if she could make anything and she told him the kitchen was closed. My friend said they just wanted something fried. She so the kitchen was closed. I've worked in a restaurant for 8 1/2 yrs and I know it's not hard to make some french fries and doesn't take long at all. Other than that it was a great evening and we had fun playing pool. They have 7 pool tables so we found one to play on easily. The bartender was friendly and the patrons were friendly and it wasn't very crowded which. I'm sure it may have gotten busier after we left. I'll definitely go back to play pool but probably not eat there since the kitchen closes before the posted time.</text>

I came here for the first time with my friends to play pool and the staff was so rude to us. One of the guys was so condescending to us as we were setting up our table. The final straw was after he talked in a baby voice to me saying not to have my beer around the table (my glass was not on the table, I was standing by it while my friend was taking her turn) and then stood there until I walked to my table while saying "now walk back to  now and set it down. Now. Thats good." A woman came up to us after she saw the interaction and said not to take it personally and that he rude to everyone. If you want to play pool go to the Downlo.</Text>

We came from pretty far  to play table tennis (ping pong) and the staff went out of their way to reserve the table for us so we didn't have to wait when we got there. (It's mostly a pool bar)  The customers were pretty young (under 35) and the place had a a fun, lively & local vibe.   We had burgers/fries. They were very good. The beer was nice and cold. It was a great 3 hour afternoon.  A fun local joint that has table tennis.  A rare gem indeed<//text>

Great atmosphere. Friendly & fun employees. The karaoke is my guy's favorite & always fun to be a part of. Any night of the week - it's the place we prefer to be.< /Text>

<Review>A very pleasent atmosphere. The staff is warm and inviting. Prices are reasonable and the food is great. Kinda feels like going over to your favorite uncle's house hanging out and playing pool with the guys.<//Review><response>None<//response>< username>

Great classic sports bar! The place to go if you want to avoid college kids or play billiards. I personally believe they have the best burgers in town! They are classically perfect, jucy, and just a little bit greasy in a great way! If nothing else I’d recommend grabbing lunch there and seeing if you like the atmosphere for a more extended afternoon/evening stay. Have fun!< /text>

Great place to get jumped and an ACL tear and knee surgery on a drunk bartender watch who still visit bar. Yes they drink a lot. Serious pool players. Knee is messed up for life
I can provide police report and text from the drunk bartender it was his birthday at midnight. Everyone lied. Remember gals name too.<//review>

<Text>Unless you're a regular do not expect good service, waited over an hour for food. While the people next to us (regulars) were fed almost immediately and asked why the kitchen didn't know sooner that they were there. Just wanted to watch the game and have a meal with my wife, not listen to the bartender claim it was too busy with a bunch of "strangers". It's a bar.

<text>Staff is welcoming, knowledgeable, cooks are excellent, food is top qjuality, pool tables are newly re-felted, there arw pool leagues, tourmamemts, and there is a challenge table in the front by the bar (winner keeps playing).   Free Pool on Sundays all day. A great local experience for all.
My favorite food os their fish and chips, and besides being the absolute best in town, they arw also the best deal for your wallet.<//text><pics>None</pics><Rating>5</Rating><Name>Jeff Wozena<//Name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
My wife and I were checking out "Other" sports bars after the GRAD closed. We came here to watch a "Warriors" game. Bartender was friendly, but quite buzzed. We went to order food, but the owner, an older woman, would not take our order. We were wearing our "God, Warriors, Family" sweatshirts. The bartender took our order and said the reason his boss did not take our order was of the first word on our sweatshirts....Wow. Just saying.  3/23/2018.....Re checked my review from TWO years ago. The false owner left a bogus response stating her employees do not drink on the job. Wow. We observed her bartender "Slam" 5-6 shots with very intoxicated customers for the hour we were there. People...Please understand business owners pay online companies to have honest NEGATIVE reviews "Washed".<//Review>

Which in return makes "The O" have a very authentic, respectable, and very confortable vibe/feel to it! I dont know what I would do with my extra time, if I didn't have a place like this in my local town to spend my time at...
If you want to have a Good Meal, have a Drink, or maybe just play a game of Pool, Pin Ball, or even Ping Pong. Then Drive Down to the Oasis where you can enjoy those activities I just mentioned above, but with good hearted honest people around you to enjoy it with you...
I HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE SOON I'LL BE THE GUY WINNING ALL THE POOL GAMES IN THE BACK...LOL</Text>< username>

A local's classic. The Oasis is often filled with either sports fans, local old-timers or billiards enthusiasts. Several pool tables, video games and a ping-pong table are available to the public.<//text>

I'm having a wonderful time at Stanton Optical in Lodi. I found wonderful glasses and the Ladies were great!! Lorena was so sweet and gently took care of me and my eyes. I like that. Misty was wonderful and took the time to help me pick out some really nice frames that I'm gonna enjoy. Alicia took time helping me decide on extras to my frames. Thank u for being so patient. You are a very helpful person I appreciate  it keep up the good work ladies!!patient< /text>

<Text>I had a horrible experience right from the beginning!! I needed an eye exam but since I may have glaucoma they said I would need to go to another store in Stockton to be seen by the doctor there. He only did a basic eye exam and didnt even dilate my eyes. It was a complete waste of time and money. When i purchased the glasses i asked for the anti glare but apparently i didn't pay for it. I thought i did because it was way more for the glasses than the advertised price. When i went in to complain about the lack of the anti glare they told me I would have to pay more!! Since i was already paying more i decided that i should probably get transition lenses on one of the pairs of glasses. I asked for the darkest lenses and paid $129. For a whole week now they haven't transitioned at all. I went back in today to tell them for the women at the counter to be absolutely and completely condescending and rude!! In a rude manner she told me i would have to pay $60 more than what i already paid. All while not wearing a mask and not even looking up my name or number to see who i was. One of the other ladies there looked me up. I will never get glasses there again or recommend anyone go there. They're a total and complete rip off!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This place is AMAZING. Aimee and the WHOLE staff need their names in shinning lights. Im super difficult with the pressure test but staff were very patient with me. The doctor was pleasant and had my exam done lightning quick! Aimee helped me with my benifits and made sure I got the proper type of lense I needed for work. They all need to be commended for their professionalism and their fun and helpful spirits! 10/10 experience!<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Absolutely disgusting service. Glasses were ordered.. they were the wrong prescription. Glasses reordered, they broke a pair of the glasses and then offered to replace the frames with one in the store (the least they could do!) And every frame that was picked they would say they that those ones couldn't be selected. Truly a tribute to the Californian mindset of zero professionalism. And the contact lenses (which are now 2 weeks late) have still not arrived. And the employees are not only incompetent, but absolutely rude

Edit: After another 3 weeks she go a refund. The next pair that was ordered were, once again, the wrong prescription! And they still didnt have her contacts in. Corporate was reached and they were at least polite. But these women need to have their Beverly Hills housewives rear ends tossed out. Truly disgusted.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Both of the glasses I purchased were too tight upon pickup so I asked them to tighten them. Took them home and one of them was tight again. At this point, I have no faith in their products so I decided to return them for a refund. It states in their brochure that I can return them if I am not satisfied. I spoke to an employee first and she told me that's not the policy. I showed her the brochure where it stated the return policy and she insisted that its not the policy. She then said to return the next day to speak to the manager. I returned the next day and spoke to the manager and she said the same thing, that that's not the policy. I showed her the brochure and said its right there in black and white that I can get a refund if I am not satisfied. She again lied to my face and said that's not the policy. She was very smug and condescending while speaking to me. I threatened to go to the Better Business Bureau and she finally said that she would have to speak to the Regional Manager to get the refund approved. 6 days later, my refund was approved.

Also, when I called the customer service number and pressed the "new customer" option, my call was answered within 10 seconds. But since I had a complaint they told me to call back and press the "existing customer" option, I did and was on hold for 1.5 hours and finally gave up and hung up. This company only cares about getting your money and does not care about you post purchase. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. WORST COMPANY EVER.</Review>

Within an hour of my first call to Stanton I had an appointment for an eye exam.
Not only were the Optometrist(s) and assistants professional, sweet and accommodating, the Manager, Mac, went above and beyond to ensure my needs and wants were met.
I recently lost my eyeglasses and could not drive at night at all without them. Calling Stanton, I got a same day appointment for my eye exam and left within an hour and a half of my arrival with TWO pair of newly prescribed eyeglasses. Mac was very patient with me while I looked at their huge selection of frames while providing his expert opinion about certain frames and styles. What a great thing, glasses while you wait!!
The frames are super cute and I couldn’t pass up the package offered for just a bit more money. My package included anti-glare, UV protection, years of repair and or replacement on lenses AND frames on BOTH pair! I won’t go anywhere else for my eyeglasses! Can’t afford to not be a patient at Stanton Optical! Thanks to Mac and the rest of the crew for an exponentially more simple and satisfying process than any other Optometrist I’ve visited. 👓 💝💯👍🏼😇<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great experience here!! I used to live closer to Elk Grove and got my glasses at the Stanton over there  but moved to Lodi awhile back. Very easy transition to this Stanton in Lodi. The staff were amazing being able to accommodate with me to fix my glasses. At the end of the day they offered me some kind of glasses special that I ended up taking the offer. At the end of the day I am a happy man going to this Stanton and the workers there are easy to work with and knew exactly what I needed. Huge shout out to Enham and Trysta for making the entire process fun and finding me a nice pair of glasses. Dama made the eye exam understandable. I believe Tayla was also there she was the one who able to find me a deal
on glasses. Overall the entire experience was great. Will be back again and recommend this place if you're in need of glasses of any kind. Ask for Enham and find some glasses.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1601497833479, 'text': 'We appreciate your great comment, Alex.

This place is very criminal. I took my son to get glasses and The redhead chubby girl is extremely rude. The buy 1 get 1/2 off went up to $438. I sat there with them and did the math and I said you guys are over charging me a $168. The staff stated that its the taxes.. Thats  BS . .  So then i wait for  2 pairs of glasses to  show up in 2 weeks like they promised and only one shows up, Then I'm told the other pair will show up a few days from now, it has now been a month and one week and nothing.  They keep blaming it on Florida UPS stating that because COVID 19 it takes over a month again BS.. I contacted customer service and Elise told me they will refund my money once a manager contacts me within 24-48 hours and she hung up on me after being extremely rude. Still nothing.  .< /Text>

They were incredibly amazing and worked with me. Ryan was so friendly and knowledgeable. He was a pure joy to work with. Jasmine was very sweet and a wonderful help to the situation I was in. Tayla (I think. Sorry!) Was also pulling glasses out of everywhere to try to find some for me. Even the technician was so nice! Really, the whole store was such a pleasure to work with. The district manager was there that day and he had a really good attitude and seems like the kind of guy I would want to be my boss. If you ask me, this is the place to get your glasses!! They are quick, knowledgeable, efficient, and kind. P.S. they all deserve raises!< /Review>

I called on a Friday to request an exam. The man I spoke with offered me two appointment times that evening. Instead, I made an appointment online for Saturday morning and it was easy to self-schedule. When I arrived the woman there told me the doctor is only there on Monday for exams. The scheduling really doesn’t make sense, if there isn’t someone qualified there to do the exam. They appear to have a good selection of frames if you already have your exam done and have a prescription on hand. They also accept most insurance, including VSP.< /Review>

<Text>Ordered glasses on Saturday. I was told they would be ready Sunday. I drive the 30 miles Tuesday to pick them up only to be told they are not made correctly and i have to come back in 5 hours to pick them up. Why did they take my phone number when i ordered them? If they knew they were not right why wait til i got there to tell me and fix them before? I love driving the extra 60 miles out of my way. Thanks for nothing.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I would give them no stars if possible. First off they don’t tell you that the eye exam is not done by someone in person. The advertising is false. I kept telling the person on the screen that everything I saw was still very blurry, then when I did receive my glasses I couldn’t see, everything looked distorted. Then I did get another eye exam done in person. The dumb receptionist tells me she will have BOTH of my pair of glasses fixed with the new prescription. A month later I call because no has called me about my glasses. The person tells me there is a pair for me so I go pick the one pair up and they still had the old prescription!!!!! Mind you I almost paid $400 for everything!!!! This is ridiculous! DO NOT COME HERE!< /Text>

Came in by today to get information on an eye exam and get glasses there and everything. As soon as I walked in there was no one at the front desk so I waited for a minute for someone to come up to me at the front desk. I saw about 5 ppl in the back all talking to each other so I thought maybe they’re in a meeting or something, I walked around and looked at some frames and no one told me they would be right with me or something I even made eye contact with three people in the back and they just looked away. Obviously won’t be going back there at all. It was my first time there too. Never been treated so insignificantly.<//Review>

I called and made an appointment. They had an opening the same day so I set it up. And while setting it up I explained that I have VSP insurance but I don't have the insurance card, I don't think I ever had it. And they told me not a problem they can look it up and I need to bring ID to verify who I am.

I get there 15 minutes early and Jasmine begins helping me. But she tries to charge me $45. I said I have VSP insurance, she asks for the card. I explained I don't have the card and what I was told on the phone. She refused to work with me.

And I call the number I called before and her phone started ringing, she looks at me and picks up the phone and hangs up and says "you need to leave".

So I did leave, and I will not be going back. I want to be reimbursed for my gas. And I want people to be trained properly.

I will be telling my friends not to go here.<//Text>

5 Star service at this Lodi, CA location on Lower Sac & Hwy 12, WalMart + other stores.
I was greeted by Sophie and it began here. I said I'm here for the special 2 for $69. As I made my decision I notice a frame I really liked. Now the collaboration of team work comes in with another assiciate, Enham, who offers a suggestion and I bought two frames with progressive lenses. I'm happy with all that is offered. When I witness customer service at it's best. Unruly client is at a clip of unhappiness piercing the air. But another associate, Tayla is giving her, her all. Even offering to call to be sure that they will not come back for nothing. Yet the woman would not let up and is now repetitive in her disgust. But Tayla kept giving her sunshine while she rained down. Handled very well. Which means buy here and whether it's Sophie, Enham or Tayla or all three, they will treat you like "fam"🙏. I saw first hand.

Maximum Respect,
ChristopherThompson< /Review>

<Text>Stanton Optical is a joke in Lodi, I was rescheduled over 5 times for an appointment. I live about 45 minutes away from Lodi. They even lied to me on several occasions saying they attempted to call me that morning to cancel the appointment in which I received no voicemail or missed phone call have an appointment being cancelled. Their excuse all the time was the optometrist was not in, and that I could not be seen. When is this optometrist ever end then? Maybe they need to find a new person to replace him that is more readily available to help the clients that they say they are there to help.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1564841654546, 'text': 'Hello Ryan Clevenger,\nLet me begin by telling you how sorry we are to know that your experience at our office was not perfect.

<rating>1< /rating><text>My very first experience at Stanton optical here in my local home town was expected to be a very professional experience. Instead az soon as I walked in my experience was horrible. The lady in the front desk asked what I was looking for. So I politely ask if I could get a copy of my prescription. She proceeded to ask if I was gonna purchase glasses there and I responded with no. Right away her demeanor changed and she asked me for ID as if I was getting a drug prescription. So I asked if I can get a new prescription and she said no doctor was available. How is no doctor available at 5 in the afternoon?? So I decided to go to Stanton optical in Stockton and no issues there. No ID need and it only took me 5 mins not even that to get my prescription.

I was here last Saturday. I previously called prior to going in to make an appointment and Tayla was super helpful with setting up an eye exam for me. Once I got there I was greeted by Dua who helped me with my eye exam as well as Enham. Then the hardest part for me is finding glasses that I like. Enham was so patient and kind with me helping me find what glasses worked for me. I probably was selecting glasses for a while lol but that was because I couldn’t decide what I wanted but there is a huge selection of men's and women's glasses/ sun glasses! Enham informed me I could get lenses put into my Ray bans! It was a easy process they were all very kind and eager to help. Thank you  ladies y’all are awesome!< /review>

Stanton in Lodi does not actually have an onsite eye doctor. The doctor that use is on a tele conference where they just tell you what to do. If you ask a question they dont answer it and just continue on with the test. Since that is a complete shot in the dark for your prescription when you go back to the office for a refund, they won't give you one.

Stanton has shown me very poor customer service when dealing with issues on my order. They are not willing to work with you and your needs. If you have an issue they just tell you to call the corporate where you will remain on hold for over an hour. Highly recommend going somewhere else where they will actually appreciate you as a customer.<//Review>

Well I went in a few days ago to get eye exam and 2 pairs the buy 1 get 1 ok and exam it all ended up being 288$ and on top the told me 3 days to wait for glasses and to come back to pick up when they open on Wednesday .....so I get off work I show up at 9 but store is closed so I wait bout 15 min and they finaly open I get in there and guess what my glasses was not there I got told by the gentleman that opened that gr hey would be in this afternoon and to come back....well my wife goes to get them for me just now well she gets up there they want to give her a hard time cause its not ne picking it up its somebody else ....then on top of it my glasses are still not in and wasted time and gas to come in for a 2nd trip to not get anything.....well I call the store and a young lady picked up I expressed my concern for the repeated trips and time being told to come in there and when I was in the middle of talking to here she says well what u want me to do about it then hangs up the phone ...I try calling back to see if we had got disconnect and they awnser and tell me to stop calling theres nothing they can do and hung up again in my face........so after all this and already spent my money there this is how they keep playing and treating customers on top iam a 1rst time customer...I would not recommend this place at all unproffesinal. Rude and cant even know where a order is..... the incompetence of the people there is amazing smh never again will I waste my time and money here.....and what happens to the free exam and sale on the frames nice sale cost almost 300$ and still get treated rude<//Text>

This is unbelievable i had been trying to get my contact lenses for over 9 months now the first time it was all blurry so i got a fallow up appointment then while i was waiting for the doctor in the office the doctor calls in sick i had to miss work for nothing so they tell me will re scheduled and give you 50% back i was like okay i guess it was fair i came back next appointment i didn’t get my 50% back and the contacts did not arrive with in two and a half months  and i was still seen blurry so i got a fallow up again and doctor again calls in sick  and so i had one more appointment made i come in 5 mins late and they did not attend me they said i had to re scheduled so now i have now made another appointment I’ve  made a total of 5 fallow ups I’m already disappointed i would not be surprised if they have to re scheduled my appointment.</Text>

<user_id>118153228450363093600<//user_id><Review>Great place, easy access, very nice management on duty. Searching online was easy and sometimes there are online deals. You can do your information online and reserve a unit for free which makes the check-in process faster. Upon arriving I was done in about 10 minutes and got to see the unit in advance. The unit was what I wanted, cleaned and ready to move in. They do sell moving and storage supplies including locks which you might need a special one depending on the unit you get.<//Review>< GmapID>

I recently moved out of this location after having renting a unit for over years. The only reason I moved out was because I found a cheaper unit closer to my house and Public Storage wasn't willing to reduce my rate. Sheila and her team, in particular Chrisann and John were always friendly and pleasant to talk to. I spoke with all 3 of them on different days while I was moving out and all 3 were very friendly. They understood why I was moving out and did not try and pressure me into staying. Sheila was always helpful over the years and even tried to get my rate reduced. I will recommend this location to my friends and family.< /text>

<Review>Public Storage location is one of those rare companies which employ any extraordinary manager - Sheila. She was very helpful and explained everything clearly. Very personable.  She asked questions to help determine my needs, then took me around to show me the availability of the different sizes. Signing up was done quickly.</Review>< Pictures>

I just came home from renting a space at Public Storage in Pleasanton (off of Boulder).  Great experience!  Sheila was very kind and helpful.  I look forward to using this space on a temporary basis to give us more room at home for company during the Thanksgiving holiday and to give us a chance to sort through our stuff and decide what to do with it permanently.< /review>

Great experience! The manager, Sheila is friendly and fast with helping you rent your storage unit. She was thorough, but did not take too long when going over the initial sign up and she wasn’t overbearing or pushy in trying to upsell any items (locks, boxes, tape, etc) I have moved quite a bit for work and family and have had numerous storage units over the years...by far this is the best experience! **bonus...the grounds are always clean and it is a safe neighborhood!**<//Text>

<text>grateful for the excellent customer service and clean, secure and well-managed space Sheila and the team provided over the years.  Even more so, when I asked about down-sizing my space, her recommendations for other facilities nearby when she didn't have what I needed.

I've been using the Boulder Public Storage for about 5 yrs. It's always been clean and well maintained and Sheila has been great! She's always friendly and has a ready smile. She makes you feel welcome, is knowledgeable and efficient. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location to my friends and family. The importance of having a great staff to work with the public cannot be stressed enough! Thanks, Sheila.<//Text>

I've been storing stuff at the Boulder Public Storage location for over 10yrs.  Sheila has been great to work with, always has a smile on her face and is willing to help in anyway possibly.  Including having her husband help me change my tire when I got a flat.  The property is always and well maintained.   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location to my friends and family. The importance of having a great staff to work with the public cannot be stressed enough! Thanks, Sheila.</Text>

<review>Sheila was extremely helpful in answering my questions and giving me information. I have been at this location for a long time and needed a different size unit. She transferred me over to a new unit with no issue at all and was very friendly the whole time. This is a great location and she is a wonderful asset for Public Storage.<//review>< response>

I've had a space here for years. Love the employees. Sheila is the best. I am delighted to see her back in the office once in a while. Public Storage is lucky to have people with great personalities and customer service focus to make up for corporate policies that are not "user friendly." Sheila gets five stars. Public Storage not so much. Every employee I've met in all the time I've been with you gives the job their best effort.< /Text>

I am impressed with this Storage Facility,  It's clean, it's easy to find and easy in and out access.  When I arrived , Sheila, the site Manager was very professional and friendly at the same time...  I picked this one because  their rates we reasonable compared to everyone else in the area..  Made my Day.. I highly recommend  this place for your Storage needs.  I was glad I took the time to shop around online, got a great deal and made a New Friend in Sheila.</review>

<Review>100% positive experience. Sheila was really helpful and friendly on move-in and on move-out, and she took extra steps to make sure I would still get pro-rated rent on move-out since the company's billing methods had changed. Best possible service. The next time I need a storage unit, I will be coming back to this Public Storage location.< /Review>< pictures>

My review covers 9/2011 to 2/2014 at the Boulder St. location where my entire communication was with Sheila. Sheila is AWESOME, and also the crew she had working there during my stay. I'm sure we all have our bad days but 99.999999% of the time Sheila knew what to do, how to help the customer, and how to keep your business at her location, and keep us the customer very happy, and retain our business for Public Storage. Sheila is a master at Customer Service. I felt comfortable storing my goods at the Boulder location with Sheila at the helm. With any Public Storage location good deals can be discovered online, and during Holidays, if you take the time to be an informed shopper. I'm very pleased with my stay and working with Sheila. I have not dealt with the new crew at this location except on move out day, 2/1/2014 which was handled very well. Believe it was with Diana. I had called several times to inquire about my move out date and charges due at time of move out, but no calls were returned. This was all worked out onsite during move out day. Would have liked a call back but it was not an issue. Thank-You Sheila, you provided relief after a  painful Short Sale on 9/2011. I will store with PS in the future if the need occurs.</text>

Sheila was great and extremely helpful. She made the whole process a breeze. And we were able to save some bucks taking advantage of their first month special deal. Over all an easy process that accommodated our complicated move.<//Text>

I came in today and was greeted by a very professional representatives Ellen and Bella. Ellen assisted me very quick and efficient renting me the perfect size storage I was looking for. Property is very clean and well maintained. I came from a competitor next door and I MUST say Public Storage's employees Ellen and Bella stole my business. THE BEST staff and a great/safe place to store!!!!!! If you need storage come here.<//text>

Sheila is very professional and efficient. She answered all my questions and paperwork and completed the entire process swiftly. I was in and out within few minutes.

And special thanks her and her husband for helping us out when our car when our car battery died<//text>

So glad to have stopped in and found the perfect spot for my extra stuff. Chrisann was a breath of fresh air and really understood everything I needed. She took the time to listen and figure out exactly what I was looking for. I am really happy with the level of service and am so thankful to have found this place.</Review>

Wow, what a difference!!! Chrisann was so helpful!!!  She helped me find the right size unit for what I needed and took time walking me through the details of the rental. We rented here because the storage facility is super clean, felt very safe, the price was right and the customer service was awesome.<//review><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

The unit was clean, in excellent condition, relatively dust free after several months, and stayed cool even on the hottest days of the summer (108 F). Only downside was upward price creep after 6 months or so. Still would recommend highly.</text><user>104445343139597955700</user><Response>None< /Response></record>

<text>I have had many different storage units over the past 20 years some at Public Storage, some at other companies. But by far the best experience is my present unit at Boulder st. in Pleasanton. My wife, myself, and my daughter have been treated in a very professional and courteous manner. Sheila is the best as well as the other staff that we have dealt with, Also the facility is kept clean and maintained, make me feel my thing are secure so I don't have to worry. I do not normally write reviews, but I felt this one was necessary.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fe9abbb87c82f:0x14dfe7c16b52131f<//GmapID></record>

It was great to work with Sheila is finding  the right storage unit for our needs.  She is very helpful in detailing the insurance, costs, security and hours of operation for this facility.  We will be sure to return and rent another unit if our needs change.  I highly recommend Sheila to anyone who is looking for a well run storage facility in Pleasanton!</Text>

The storage space was very clean and ready to go. Also the storage unit is easy to access and maneuvering truck or trailer around the yard very simple.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Nice secure location, clean property, plenty of units varying in size, friendly and competent staff.  That's everything I look for in a storage place.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.</text>

< Review>
I was very pleased with the outstanding expertise,  patience and extremely  knowledgeable history that was expressed throughout our walkthrough.  Sheila made it a nobrainer where our property will be held from now on.  Visiting a number of establishments in the last week the buck stopped with Public Storage.  Thanks again Sheila ,if you ever read this.  P.S., Brothers coming by on Friday.<//Review>

I have done business with PS many time in the area for my buisness.
All of the locations in this area are very professional and courteous.
I will continue to use PS for all my buisness related storage needs in this area.

Oh and it doesn't hurt that Jessica is also very cute too.

Not to mention the General Manager Bella, whom I had the pleasure to meet hear also.( Another cutie. )

Okay so not the reason to buisness here but it doesn't hurt.

<Review>I would certainly recommend this location to any of my friends/family members based on my interactions with Chrisann.
It was a cold stormy night (about time we received some rain) and I needed to unload a rental truck.  This location is about 10 miles from where I live (at least 3 other locations closer to me) but they had the size/type of unit I was looking for.  I made the appointment around 5pm and needed to check in that evening.  Within seconds of confirming online, Chrisann called to confirm my reservation.  She answered all of the questions that I still had and knew that I was on my way.  When I arrived she greeted me with a smile, confirmed what we had covered on the phone, walked me out to see the unit, and then back to the front to finish the paperwork.  Chrisann was very thorough as she explained the details of the agreement and dollar amounts.  She definately made the experience easy and less stressful.  Thank you.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>The best thing about San Francisco is that it has the best dim sum selections yet with absolutely no cut throat competition. Like, all these amazing dim sum places can live together in harmony. You really can't go wrong with my ultimate choice, House of Banquet in the Inner richmond. It's traditional Chinese dim sum served in carts and with ridiculously affordable prices. You'll definitely want to clear your weekend morning for this brunch. It won't be fast but it will be worth your time.<//Review>< rating>

<text>Great experience. It was my first dim sum restaurant so I don't know how its food compares to others, but it was definitely tasty! The place was completely packed when we went in but it was very organized and with fast push cart service! They've obviously created an effective system through experience.<//text>< Rating>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>So been here dozens of times over the years and for some reason this time stood out. A +2 for service, fast friendly and above service, food also ups a notch or 2 as the food was fast to serve and had a better taste than usual.
This with their usual cheap prices boost this place up to 4 stars. Would even say thanks!  Try it out.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Average dim sum with generous portions at reasonable prices.  Sometimes this still hits the spot especially if you want convenience.  It's a large restaurant so rare to wait or wait long.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808587162a03d56d:0x5cd53ba5d03201f0<//Gmap_id></record>

House a banquet is a big place for dim sum during lunch. The dim sum is served upstairs with the carts. I enjoy the food and the price . The place gets packed on the weekends.

This place also gets packed during dinner. I've gone here many times for dinner. This place serves typical Chinese banquet food which is my favorite.

I recommend coming early to get street parking.< /Review>

You have to answer your phone. They will call you day prior to send you your tickets legitimately through a website like AXS (app) once you establish an account (it takes a minute). I didn’t have a bad experience. I purchased tickets through TicketSMARTER (not TicketMaster). They called me twice day prior (I missed the calls). and morning of day event to transfer tickets. We got BETTER seats than what we paid for. It’s a risk , but it turned out great for us.< /Text>

Darren and the crew he works robbed people of their money. Not only is there a hidden $250 fee applied after tickets are purchased but they wouldn't give anyone a refund for over a year, held our money captive and then transferred the tickets to ticketmaster so he doesn't have to deal with us anymore. Don't purchase anymore tickets from these evil people. Help them rot and go out of business.</review>

Bought tickets for a concert
Concert date was postponed and then eventually canceled. We received NO notice, other than see a refund, minus service fee, on my account.
I called to ask why a full refund was not returned.
A fellow, saying his name was Mr. Green, just blabbered on and on, not listening to my questions regarding a FULL refund. He said read your terms of agreement.
I then advise, no service was rendered and I would report this to the authorities. He said he would refund the balance from his own pocket.
Just received the balance money today.</Text><response>None<//response><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

If I could give a negative star I would! They are master manipulators and master deception artists! They are such an atrocious business that the only thing they are good at are being belligerent and condescending. Their “customer complaint” department is probably larger than their sales department. They prey on confusing people. They prey on people who are distracted when buying legitimate tickets. They’re ruthless. You’re at Ticketmaster or other legit sites and click one wrong link and then you get diverted to one of their 3rd party sites. FYI they have tons of 3rd party sites that are linked to them. Then this 3rd party site is made to replicate Ticketmaster and other legit sites. It’s fraud by deception.</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Dealing with this company was truly horrible.  When I was purchasing tickets to the Juice Wrld concert at The Greek Theater, to surprise my son for his birthday, they led me to believe that the three tickets that I was purchasing were three rows from the stage, which I was happy to pay a premium price for.  I think we ended up paying about $800 in total for all three seats.  When we got to the event, the tickets were literally in the last bench, not even three seats, a bench mind you, all the way at the top of the stadium.  I would be very CAUTIOUS and CAREFUL dealing with All Access Tickets.  Buyer Beware!  There are a lot more ethical and reputable companies around that you can do business with.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

We just wanted to thank you and the All Access Tickets team for a great job regarding our recent event in Amsterdam. As you know I spoke to all the other ticket agents prior to speaking to you and I chose you guys because of your personal touch and flexibility. All the way through any problems that did arise we met by the words 'Let me see what I can do for you" and then promptly sorted out. We'll definitely be working with you again and we will gladly recommend you to our friends.Thanks</review>

<Review>Great service; all tickets as represented.  Prices are greater than face value in the secondary resale markets and All Access is very open and transparent about that.  When concerts are sold out, you really have no choice except to enter the secondary resale market if you want to grab tickets to a sold out show</Review>< Pics>

Consumers should pay close attention to fees which All Access fails to disclose until just before you click "Purchase".   The fees are extremely high, thus escalating the purchase price from the realm of reasonable to rather high.   The tickets, both times I used this company, were accurately represented.   Other than the fee issue, which is a big issue, I was satisfied.< /review>

All Access upgraded our tickets unsolicited.  We had paid a significant amount for two tickets to an event, but All Access provided us markedly better tickets at no extra cost to us.  This was our first time using All Access.  We will definitely use it again.</text>

We appreciate that last minute sales deserve an increase in price, and people have a right to make a bit from the opportunity, but this is just out and out greed. We are thinking of going to see our Congressman to try get this kind of profitability outlawed. I shall never use their services again.<//text>< Response>

Parking is the worst at the Virginia Beach Veterans Amphitheater.  We wasted our money on the Summer Country fest tickets.  We waited in our car for over an hour last night at Luke Bryan just to enter the parking lot only to be rerouted out of the lot to the main road.  No more parking.  They must have over sold the concert.  We never saw the concert.  The parking attendants were all very very young and did not know what to do.  This is a major problem and must be addressed by the managers of the venue.  If Kenny Chesney fails next week, we will never go back again.  I would like a refund.</Review>

I purchased two tickets through them before tickets went on sale to public. I was charged $460 total for 2 tickets! They bought the tickets from the website the day the tickets were made available to public and sent me a printed copy of the tickets, with the price they paid and everything. For 2 tickets they only paid $60, so they made $400 off me! When I tried calling them to complain they first didn't answer, then had some answering service call me back and tell me that someone would be in contact with me in next 24 hours. Never heard from them again!   DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE! If this is how they do business, you're better off buying the tickets yourself cause they obviously don't get any special perks.<//Review><user_id>115477657382940892698</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Never and I mean NEVER buy tickets from this company!!!  Always, always shop around buy from anyone else.  My FIL got rapped buying tickets from them.  Paid literally 5 times more for the same seats than all the other companies combined.  When we spoke to them about it their customer service was absolutely astonishing!!!  Never EVER have I heard someone treat another so RUDELY ever!!!!  This goes for the management as well.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!</Review>< pictures>

I was able to obtain two tickets to a concert at Concertgebouw in Amsterdam before leaving California, at the last minute. The service was prompt, professional and an excellent value. I would not hesitate to contact them again.</review>

<Text>Seems to be a scam. Paid nearly 700 bucks for two "front row tickets." Got to the venue. Turned out I had two 25 dollar tickets. At least they got me seats, though.

Texted the seller -- they'd been trying to text me to okay a fedex, which was strange -- and he said "trust me. No mistake." He gave me a number to call but that number just puts you into a long list of ads and surveys.

Scam, scam, scam.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Horrible experience.

I bought 2 separate tickets to a concert that were not side by side seats. I asked the ticket seller if they could find me 2 tickets that sit together I would prefer those. They gave my initial tickets away without securing 2 other seats. They only found me 2 more tickets 1 hour before the concert began. I could not accept them because I had missed my only transportation to the venue which was over 2 hours away. Instead I asked for a refund becuase I chose not to go to the venue; they said they could not garauntee finding me tickets so it would have been senseless to travel 2 hours for nothing. I was not granted a refund ($750) because they said all they had to do was "find me tickets before the concert started" and it would not be their responsibility.<//text>

<Text>Absolutely awful. I was overcharged for two tickets to a concert ($600.00) tickets that I thought were $60. When I saw charges on account, I immediately called and was told they would correct. It went into a two - three week fiasco and a call to Texas Attorney General Office. Their claim was I should have known...but my confirmation email did not show charged price. This should have been a clue, but after weeks of wrangling with the owner, promises made and finally a call from TX Atty General, they refunded $200.00. They are completely a scam company. By the way...this was a Charlie Wilson concert ...not Beyoncé!!!</Text>< Pics>

All Access Tickets is a devious company. The terms and Agreement the company forces the buyer to sign is not clear at all and the consequence is you will never get a refund in the event of death or medical emergency.<//Text>

If I could give this company zero stars I would. Their customer service was absolutely horrendous, my tickets did not arrive in time, day of some guy called me to try and give me other tickets since mine were given away. When I said I would need to check with the person I was going with, he rescinded his offer of refunding me my money. The only reason I got my money back is because I started crying hysterically and the guy just wanted me to stop. This is the worst company ever, don't ever use them! And the only reason I'm writing this is because they are STILL sending me emails even though I've unsubscribed from them multiple times.< /text>

< Review>
Bought tickets through this company to see the killers in Las Vegas on Feb 3rd. I've been to every killers concert in Las Vegas since their first album. After the mass shooting on October 1st in Las Vegas we decided we do not feel safe going to a concert in Las Vegas any longer and called for a refund. Here are some of the things that were said to us by managers Alex and Darrin from All access Tickets.
"We don't refund tickets because your scared, plus the concert is 6 months away from now" "29,999 other people are not afraid to go to the concert so you shouldn't be either" "you should have bought ticket insurance for this exact reason" yeah like we knew someone would shoot 58 people at a concert. Darrin equated this to the same as being in a car accident for a reason to not want to attend a concert. Darrin is lost in the money behind this company and cares about nothing else and no one else. Bottom line this company is heartless, ruthless, and completely disconnected to their client base. After Darrin telling me if I actually called the merchant who took our payment I could get a refund through them that was untrue also, as they have to have approval from All Access Tickets to give the refund which Darrin would not provide. Tracey the manager of the company who took our payment said that All Access Tickets doesn't think they can sale the 2 tickets in the 6 month timeframe and that it's too close to the date of the concert, yet 6 months time according to Darrin is enough time to feel comfortable attending a concert after the biggest tragedy in our city's history.  Darrin also offered to resale the tickets for me even though he feels that 6 months timeframe to refund them is not an appropriate amount of time to garner a refund, makes total sense right? Never ever ever buy tickets from All Access Tickets or Ticket Liquidators.< /Review>

<Text>I thought i was ordering my tickets directly through ticket master so you can imagine my surprise when I received my bill and was charged in US $$. We proceeded anyway as it was a concert we won't be able to attend again.
Was told tix would be emailed to me the week before the concert so when I hadn't received anything by Tuesday (concert was Sunday) I called to follow up. I was told there was a slight back log but I should have by Wednesday.
Friday rolls around so I called again and was apparently to the manager. He was pleasant enough and explained there was a technical issue hence the delay and i should have them by 8:30 that evening. By 1 pm EST Saturday, I hadn't received anything yet (keeping in mind with Exchange it cost us $1540 for 4 tix) so I simply called for an update. When I was put through, the same manager came on the phone and started ranting at me how they are still working on the problem and I would have my tickets that day...No hello, greeting, nothing. I didn't even get a chance to say hello. I was pretty patient and understanding until he answered the phone so incredibly rude. So i pointed out we were just a little anxious as we had paid quite a lot of the tix already and his response was, do you want a refund? No I didn't want t refund, i just wanted my tickets. We hung up and my phone rang a few minutes later and it was HIM calling me back to inform me that they were/are on the west coast and they had actually been open for 1 hour as it was only 10am there and i would have my tickets that day...again being very abrasive and rude. I had no idea they were on the west coast and clearly it was irritating him enough to call ME back...He was a total douche and if I had thought for one second I could get tickets or ever see the Tragically Hip live again, i would have told him to stick his tickets. That being said, I will never use this company again as even if you're patient (sorry for following up) and I wasn't rude when I called they treated me very poorly. NOT good customer service at all.

When I explained that I had no details around how the charge was made  the, alleged supervisor, just insisted that all sales were final, no matter what.<//text>

<Text>What a SCAM!!  We purchased tickets to a Christian concert, of all things (Hillsong United May 9th concert). Over $500 each for really good seats they said. So stupid. I thought we were buying from the venue site.  When I later contacted the actual venue site, they said that outfits pay big bucks to get listed first on web searches, and that they are helpless to do anything, and that people get fooled. Its really crafty as I entered the venue site, but the scammers hijacked their name and made it look like the actual venue!  When we attended the event, we found that our tickets were really only $90 each. What a scam!  I had second thoughts after buying the tickets and called them for a refund, which they refused and said that they could not do, but would give us back $100 refund per ticket, which they did.  Whooppee!!  What a racket!!  Certainly not very Christian!!  I guess God will take care of them for cheating those who were worshipping Him..  Really sad,< /Text>< Pictures>

These folks are crooks, over charged us $800, for 4 tickets.  They would not listen, didn't care.  We paid over $1500 for tickets that were less than $100. each.  They were not even close to where they were suppose to be, and not together. DO NOT TRUST THESE FOLKS, SCAMMERS......</Text>

He went above and beyond, excellent customer service, much appreciated John.</review>< name>

I got here one hour before opening and it was a great choice. It is now 8:38 AM, 38 minutes after opening and I am walking away with my transactions completed. The lines are crazy long outside, but the inside is very clean and socially distanced. The guy who was setting up outside barking instructions was a little bit on the rude side.. however, the customer service inside was great.</review>

<review>This location have very poor posted instructions  and in person customer services today. Was there to pick up a sticker that was already been paid only and didn't get done due to bad in person services not provided properly. Was in line for over 30 mins and got temperature scanned in but was not issued a proper ticket.  Than I was told by the 2 associate  ladies to get back in line all over again. There's about 20 people in that line at the moment.<//review>< gmap_id>

<rating>2</rating><review>Like ANY typical dmv in California this one blows just as much as the rest. It’s not that they are disorganized. They set lines for everything. Nope, it’s that there staff like all of them DONT GIVE A RIP about whether we the public stand or sit or whatever we can do to achieve any comfort for hours on end. This one gets less than my other dmv reviews because of “Covid” rules we are standing in freaking masks out in the Death temperatures of Fresno waiting to get in line. again to wait inside in another line to get a ticket. For guess what? Yup yet another line before were FINALLY at the final moment where we find out oops only takes cash today our machine is broken lol!

Had my application filled out online they gave me a code to take to the Dmv. While in a long line a Dmv employee asked if anyone had started the application online and had the code 4 people out of approximately 30 got moved to the front of the line because they had the code. My daughter was with me needing her ID as well. She had not completed the online application when we arrived. However, she quickly completed the application online got her code and also was allowed to enter the Dmv. Had we not completed online applications we would have had to come back the next day, not everyone in line at 3pm got in to the building for service. Very happy with the experience I was dreading. All in all a win for me.<//Text>

The 2 stars is solely based on poor management. The manager at the Olive Ave Branch is the most unprofessional manager that I have dealt with in my life. From her appearance to her persona to her way of handling a circumstance. She really, truly, SUCKS!

As for the rest of the staff; friendliness, efficiency, cleanliness and all around great place to go to handle dmv business. I would rate the Olive Ave DMV Branch a 4 1/2< /review>

<text>Took my daughter to DMV on Blackstone The driver instructor was horrible and very unprofessional Period. Took my daughter to this one on Olive and the driver instructor was tough but very professional. I recommend taking your child here if you want the attitude of strict but professional and fair  Driver instructor. I wrote a review about the DMV on Blackstone and the experience that my daughter had which was absolutely awful. This DMV is five stars much better and  definitely recommend! It wasn’t just the driving instructor that was good it was also the people inside helping others and helping us with the driver process just so much nicer people. Even the Security Guard was nice. Who knew the DMV could actually have nice people. ( At least the one on Olive)🤷🏻‍♀️<//text>< Pics>

Great experience this visit! In and out in 2 hours!
*wear a mask
*if doing a drivers license or id card - do your app online AND write your confirmation # down - this will DRASTICALLY help your time
*be prepared to wait and for a line
*come relaxed
*be respectful< /review>

Here at the DMV. Be sure to check the website out before you venture on down.   You may just be instructed by a dmv worker who's trying to get everyone processed, or you might just experience a fist fight from some unrelated disgruntled citizens.  Because you know that's what needs to occur at the DMV while youre getting your license.   Definatly fill out your application online first in this day and age, or others will pass you in line who already did.</review>

I just wanted to give a big Shout Out to the associates of the Fresno Olive DMV. The gentleman working outside, keeping lines going was very friendly and helpful.

Then Jason was incredibly helpful and gave excellent customer service. I was registering my vehicle after moving here from another state. This location set the bar on Customer Service! Makes the visit to the DMV so much better when you receive a high level of customer service.

Thanks for making my trip as pleasant as possible.<//text>

A lot of people in line an hour before opening, I was about in the middle as the line was wrapping around the building. But as soon as they opened the line went by very fast. Half hour to go in and do a quick application for a number and waited another half to get called to the window. During the pandemic, the staff was tough and needed to be cuz people were not listening so I give the dmv and the staff 5 stars. I really appreciate their work and their patience and how quickly they help people. Thanks!<//review>

Like how they try to get everyone in except today i had a security tell me i couldn't go in with my sweater on(bcc logo) told him it's a brand but still decided to take it off to insure i would go inside. Also was made wait longer even heard anothee associate ask him why didnt he let us in first (online appointment with confirmation number) did not get the name but suggest they work on how they approach and enforce regulations or keep personal opinions to themselves. Besides that i think this is a pretty good location even if it seems to be overcrowded outside.< /Text>

This place is awesome, beats the other in-town local branches/locations. I first went to north side and was turned away even with a qualified reason. This place doesn't discriminate and they are professional. Even with the long wait times, this is the BEST and #1 location. The staff deserve all the praise. Great job wonderful employees!!!!< /review>

INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!

First things first — the inside is literally like an international airport terminal. The design/architecture are awesome!!

Now onto Covid Safety. All the chairs were at least 6 feet apart from one another, and everybody in lines were 6 feet apart (there were little tape markers on the ground, each 6 feet away from the next). All the employees wore masks, and all the DMV visitors were required to wear masks too. After a DMV employee met with a visitor, they wiped down their desk with water to clear all the germs, before they helped the next visitor!!

Now onto employees — absolutely fabulous. One kind lady took care of my paperwork very efficiently. A nice man was my behind-the-wheel test proctor, and he was awesome! He gave me clear instructions and great feedback.<//review>

<username>Murriel Green</username><rate>1</rate><review>I think that the DMV system is letting so many customer's down especially the handicap, their people at the front entrance are very rude they know that it's hard for some to stand out in a line that are wrapped around the building.
What has happen to convenience? not everyone is computer savvy or have access to a computer. Yea we know that they has COVID to blame it on but there will be no problem of excepting a payment on line, but anything else is confusing as heck and it's very sad that it happens at all DMV.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>They were most helpful even their I did not have an appointment. They will only seem people with appointments but they took time out to look over the paperwork I had and put it in the express deposit saying that they thought that's all I would need since I've been trying to do this for three weeks. I have no complaints with them the lady that helped me was so nice. I would tell you her name but I don't think that would be to her advantage. I just know that it was a great experience< /review><userid>117551995872998123763<//userid>< Pics>

That lady got mad at me just cuz i asked a question . I gave my papers in her hand she threw on the table instead giving back in my hand. I didn’t say anything nd i said Have a good but she turned her face. Anyways overall experience was good.< /Text>< resp>

I used to believe like everyone else that a visit to the dmv was like purgatory but this last visit was a pleasant surprise theyve become alot more efficient way less agonizing and time consuming. The lines moved quick the facility is clean, spaciouse, conservatively designed and well lit with natural light. I went in for a new id and was done and out in under two hours . The only thing negative I have to say is phone reception is weak inside they should have a Hotspot set up and than it would be perfect.<//text>

Very UNPROFESSIONAL! The Manager "Rolando" actually LIED to me in front of employees & customers. I verified the facts on DMV website, same day.

Now?!? I RECORD all transactions on my cell phone or GoPro or camcorder. You have the right to RECORD ALL INTERACTIONS WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. It's the only way to keep them honest.  I do more research before I go to the office. Ask Questions & verify.

You may want to USE a different Branch of DMV... the problem is the Government has a monopoly, they don't have to "Cultivate Repeat Business". We have no other choice. There is AAA where you can avoid the DMV for certain things.

I hope this helps. Good Luck & Happy Trails!< /Text>

<review>1 hour before opening, the line was100 yards long. Then  15 minutes before scheduled to open, they let people in outside the entrance only. Then they broke the lines down to 2 lines.
One line for all kinds of registrations
The other line was Drivers licenses Renewal....
At 10 min.til opening, an official will scan your temperature and give you a DMV screen tag to the first 50 people (both lines )
When you get inside, they will direct you..
For me it was a total of (2.hours).
I was the first of 50 people to walk inside  the DMV building when the opening doors opened..

2 hr line wait outside in triple digit heat. Office was short staffed. Online system nor walk up kiosk would allow registration to be processed so had to wait in line. Which there was no issue as once my turn came up took less than a minute to pay and get my tags with no fuss. Getting some stars because the employees were apologetic, and communicative. They were doing best they could. Did see supervisors not doing much, you would think they would help out the front line workers.< /Review>

Most of the staff I interacted with to renew my DL where kind & helpful except for one rude woman at the help desk, I regretfully did not get her name. She would use an unnecessary rude tone as if annoyed to assist & would refuse to make a follow up appt for another issue I was asking of. Thankfully I asked another associate & had an appt made.</Text>

<review>I had a scheduled appointment.  It was made prior to Covid-19 disruptions, but the DMV contacted me via text and email a week prior to my email that they would honor my appointment.  My appointment was at 10 am.  I arrived 10 minutes early.  An employee pre-checked me in and directed me where to go.  Another employee verified all my documents were  correct, while I waited in line.  I was then given a number and told to wait.  That wait was for maybe 30 seconds.  The employee took my information, I got my picture taken and paid my dues.  I left at 10:06 am.  This was my second pleasant visit to this location.  The online "Express Experience" was easy and made the process go by so easy.<//review>< Pics>

This dmv is very LAZY!!! They don't give you any information on how to make an appointment or where to look to make get what you're looking for!!! This is a big dmv but they lack in giving the people a helping hand. Negative 0 stars if I can use that. Would highly recommend to never come here<//Text>

Waited in line for 5 hours,  the system crashed,  then afterwards,  couldn't get my license due to not having the right paperwork.  This new ID is very disenfranchising to the commonwealth and is not preventing any sort of fraud from my perspective.</Text>

Spoke to Mari over the phone, she was so incredibly nice, helpful, and patient! Basically the exact opposite of everyone I've dealt with at the DMV. She helped me check on 10+ vehicles for my company and didn't give a single hint of exasperation with my situation. Thank you so much for your help Mari!< /Text>

I was very fortunate. Thanks to Ashley (window 13), I had a wonder experience here getting my plate. She extremely helpful and patience throughout the entire process. Looking at the number of people in the room, it will be a crazy day ahead for her but somehow she is able to remain calm and collected with a smile. Two thumbs up!
The reputation for DMV in general isn't so great. They need more employees like Ashley if they want to improve their rep.<//Review>

It's not bad if you get there early and you should get there early because parking becomes scarce. This branch has a lot of windows and early in the morning most of them are staffed making the waiting times less than later in the day.<//text>< Pics>

Its worse now.  Especially with this heat and we have to wait outside in the sun.  Long lines and the person at the door not hearing you.  Let the seniors in the building and out of the heat, put some shade screens and misters out for those in line.  Dang is it that hard?  Not a happy person with the way they are running things there.<//Review>

I arrived at 6:30am on a Friday to wait in line there was about 7 people already waiting. The security officer opened the gate and had us form 4 lines outside of the buildings entrance. The lines were divided by those that have an appointment, those that are using the kiosk, and for those that don’t have an appointment there was a line for registration and a line for CDL/CL. THEY ARE TAKING WALK INS. You cannot cut in-line the security officer was really on it making sure no one was cutting and everyone was in the line that they were supposed to be in. They started letting people in at 8am, starting with those that have an appointment(which wasn’t really much) and those using the kiosk and then 7 people from the line for registration and 7 people from the line for CL/CDL, about 5-10 minutes past then they do the same thing again, all from appt, then kiosk, then 7 reg, then 7 CL/CDL. I was in the line for registration, but I was also there for my CDL and I was able to do both. I did the registration and told the lady that I was also there for the CDL and she gave me a number I sat down and not even 5 minutes later called up to a window and then left like 5-10 minutes later. In all I waited an hour and 40 minutes to be seen, but 1 hour and 30 minutes from that 1 hour and 40 minutes is from arriving way before the actual opening time because I knew there was going to be a line. Inside the building I was able to get everything done in 10 minutes and leave without waiting no more that 5 minutes to be called up to a window. YOU CAN TAKE KIDS AND YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK INSIDE THE BUILDING. Over all it went really well, fast and everyone was really friendly and helpful. I say arrive early, I fell like the time that I arrived was a perfect time because when I left it was I believe 8:20am and there was two very long lines of people waiting outside the buildings entrance, wrapping outside the gates onto the sidewalk. I hope this was helpful.<//review>

What does COVID 19 have to do with getting my car registered after being repaired? Since when did the government of California gain the rights to stop the business of a tax paying entreprenuer?

DMV website: Go to the DMV for verification of vin
DMV: Got to the the website to schedule an appointment.
DMV website: New appointments are currently not available.
Governor  Gavin Newsom: "Essential business's share remain open and conduct business as normal"

Is there a way to brand the DMV with a salvage/ junked title?< /Text>

Somehow this wasn’t just one miserable visit, but two full day visits to Fresno and later Merced to correct their mistakes, a call to their Sacramento legal group, and months of waiting. They never input my drivers test completion or sent my new drivers license. My temporary wasn’t even valid. Had I not saved my score sheet and temporary license I would have had to re schedule and re take the test meaning an even longer wait. Here I am months later finally holding my permanent drivers license (that Merced corrected and sent out) with my old photo because Fresno also forgot to update that. Several people forgot to do their jobs.<//review>

I can't believe I am unable to post this without rating it with at least 1 star. It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I waisted 2 hours waiting to be told my personalized plates were destroyed 32 days prior to my prescheduled pick up date. Staff has been proven to be incompetent, deceitful liars. The entire building and people therein smelled of marijauna. If you love to be frustrated, this is the place to be.</text>

< review>
I had an appointment for a  Real ID.
The person at the window #17 ( don’t know his name , long light color hair , eyeglasses) was very rude and made me feel “ small” every step of the way using a very harsh tone of voice and being very intimidating.
I had all the paperwork ready, all paperwork completed on line. He misplaced one of my papers on his desk and from there everything went downhill, trying to show me I don’t have the necessary paperwork and I don’t know what I am there for.
At the end he realized how awful he treated me and apologized.
It was a little too late for that!!!</review>

The DMV will not answer my calls or application. I was on hold for over an hour and finally got in touch with someone but once I asked her a question, she hung up on me. I am currently on hold for the second time.< /Text>

There is a woman - the craziest behind-the-wheel examinator in this DMV! She is like aggressive school teacher. And if she doesn t like you, she will do all the craziest things to make you fail! The other two guys are very friendly and normal people, try to have them for driving test. If you want to pass BE AWARE OF HER!< /Review>

Went in expecting to be there for a while and was pleasantly surprised at how quick the process was. I was in and out in just over an hour with no appointment on a Friday morning. Friendly and helpful staff too. Also, the entire place itself is very nice and bright.</Text>

<Review>This was my best experience at a dmv! Anyone who went in the 80s & 90s know what I'm talking about. My daughter's license was stolen so we  drove an hour away from Oakhurst with no appointment on a Saturday.  We got there by 7:45. Between the staff helping outside to direct people where to go & the staff inside the process was streamlined. When our # was called the woman was friendly and quick. We were only there 45 min! In the past I've spent hours at the dmv with an appointment!  Everyone was friendly.  I highly recommend this location...just get there as early as possible.<//Review>< Time>

I've always had a great experience here! Yes the wait times can be long but that's true of all DMV offices. The people here are great and the atmosphere is great!  You take a number and get to have a seat and wait just a little bit and when your number is called the help you pretty quickly.< /text>

Thankfully, I had all of my required paperwork ready for processing. Plenty of seating, loved the new redesigned DMV. The staff was very professional courteous, friendly, information exchanged. My time at the window was about 10-12 minutes or less. Awesomeness,  loved it, would recommend this location over Sierra at Blackstone.

<rate>1</rate><text>Spent almost 4 hours “waiting” just to be told I needed my marriage license in addition to my SS card, birth certificate and proof of residence to get my “real I.d.” from DMV (the last 3 items were the only things listed in a newspaper article recently found in the Fresno Bee, or read on a sign in the DMV offices or even told to me by a DMV “person behind the desk” while there previously to renew my driver’s license)!!

Lucky for me I have only been married once and had a driver’s license in two different names, my maiden name and my married name.  I was told today that one must have a “paper trail” of your name changes from your birth certificate to current time you are applying for your “real I. D.”.

I wonder what I will be told on my 3rd visit!  It’s a good thing the “real I.D.” doesn’t go into effect until October 2020...it might take one that long to actually get it!!!<//text></record>

Another time I was in and out in about 30 minutes, so it just really depends on the time and day.

The Hispanic man made me tear up after he failed me on the driver test because of the way he has spoken to me. Very disrespectfully and his persona vibe that he gave me was that he wanted the test fast, done, and over with; as if he really hated his job.< /Review>

< review>
Pink haired Lady at the drivers license area was terrible, horrible attitude and told us we couldn’t take a new picture for a permit when a lady we worked with last time said we could, as long as we asked to take another picture as soon as we got there. She was just so rude for no reason and on top of that she was my driver person for my test and failed me for making a wide turn onto an empty street and gave me late AF turning instructions which she blamed on me as well.</review>

A very slow process filled with disrespectful employees. Majority of the workers seems like they don't even want to be there to begin with and they truly lack customer services. I could not complain about this issue so much. All these rude attitude towards customer that don't deserve to be treated like they're cowards. No proper communication. It either they're very rude/aggressive or they're just straight up dry and lazy. Last year when I took my permit test, this white lady was raising her voice to this old hispanic man who didn't know where to go. They act like they're so special. Very immature with the way they handle their stress too. They can't control their anger and use it upon their customers whenever they're " having a bad day . Here's an advice for yall.

Be professional. When you're in your duty, do your job right. Whatever personal issue you're having. Keep it to yourself. If you're having a bad day, suck it up. No need for you to be selfish and start acting like you're so special and that other should respect you. First of all, why work there if yall suck at giving customer service knowing it a busy place. Second of all, learn your manners. Respect others just like how you wanted to be respected by them.< /Text>

Hey people it's the DMV! Nobody likes dealing with smog checks and registration,  working there would make anyone curt. Put yourself in their shoes I wouldn't want that job.<//Text>

<text>When I make an appointment I usually wait 5min max before its my turn, the people are nice and make it a really simple process. Pay 15$-20$, give info to put on you license, vision test, picture,  permit test, permit, then your out. It took me less than an 50min for everything. I like how they give you options on how to take your drivers permit test, and give you encouragement when you didn't pass ( passed my second time).  The key is to schedule an appointment, don't just walk in cause you never know how many people are going to be there. 😋😇😋< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

On the other hand, it was about 10:30 & the kiosk line ended at the entrance, it seemed like the line for a worker moved faster but idk. If you need to show proof of insurance or your ID or anything like that, you have to see a worker, so don't waste ur time in the self service line.</Review><UserId.>112218269501491820014< /UserId.><rating>4< /rating></record>

<Text>The rude lady at window #13 was SO RUDE to my grandma! She was taking her vision test, had a paper covering her eye, which she accidentally let slip out of her hand and the lady acted like my grandma was trying to cheat! "Ma'am i need you to not uncover your eye again! Im not going to tell you the letter of the line if you dont cover it!" She let the paper slip ONE time. She acted like we were inconveniencing her.
This made my grandma really stressed out right before her test! She ended up failing her test because she was so upset. I REALLY hope that the customer service in service helps these employees because i dont EVER want anyone to treat my eldery grandmother like that again!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I went to DMV on 10/10/2018 at 830 in the morning the lines to check in are confusing now! there are two separate lines to check-in. And a  hand written paper at the door with arrows pointing to the lines.  After getting assigned a #G66 so I waited  an waited around 10.30 someone stared call out number's by voice everyone was confused they didn't tell anyone what was wrong. So the automatic voice machine wasn't call out the G# so a lady who is sitting behind the desk came out and asked everybody if they had the number G an if so to sit in   one section of the DMV because our numbers were never called it was a mess.<//Text>

I went for license renewal, very simple very casual lalala... I end up coming out of there with chest pain + in tears!
The front guy the a**wipe, told me to be quite after I called out his discrimination. He has a post for ppl like me and he tells me to be quite.
With appt. I was in this dmv for 2 hours.
Our system is rotten and we are nothing but blind sheeps.<//Text>

<review>Terrible customer service I called assistance to help me with the machine that only took half of my money and the other half it didn’t want to take I was waiting for someone to help me for a good 15 minutes. There was more people in line as well which were getting irritated. Now I have to go pay the full amount again and wait till I receive a stupid check from the dmv for the amount the machine took. this is ridiculous!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

I was treated rudely by this guy named Danny that works for the DMV. He was not helpful and didn't even attempt to let me know the correct information and told me if I didn't like what he was saying that I had to get back in line and he called another person and the security guard escorted me out and to the end of the line< /review>

I had a bad experience here today. I waited in line for kiosk to find i cannot pay with Cash. There needs to be a sign (high) above the kiosk stating any problems the machine is having. (Wonder 'what' was wrong w/it ??? How long it has had this problem?
I do recommend if you are paying w/debit card, just call or go online.</Review>

<Review>Either arrive at 7AM and wait at the non-appointment door (the middle one) or have an appointment. If you show up at 8am, you will be 10-15 people deep and the wait will be at least two hours. There is no sign to say which door is non-appointment and which one is appointment. Line up at the middle friggin' door. If you're there by 7 and one of the first people, you'll be out of there by 8:30am.

The staff are a bit worn out and can be cold because people don't do any research before they come. Not surprising.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Waited 4 hours here today and will have to start completely over again on Monday. It took over 1 hour just to get a number. The numbers are now your initials and the last four digits of your phone number, so you have no way to gauge if you are close to being called or not. At the 2 hour mark that can be problematic if you need the restroom, crave a smoke break or wanna run to the convenience store. I know I'm usually hesitant to leave the waiting area after waiting so long because I assume (and rightly so) that I could be called at any moment... Only to be kicking myself for not going to do it when they first had the urge after another hour passes.
Once my number was called (well after 5:00pm) I was relieved to find out I didn't have to take a test even though my license expired last August. I gave them everything they needed and was ready to pay. I slid my American Express Bluebird card and although I had plenty of money in my account, my transaction was denied. She told me they only take cash, check or debit. My bluebird card is an online "bank" account. They offer direct deposit, bill pay, paper checks, online check deposit/check"cashing", cash deposits via Walmart and other participating retailers, cash withdrawals from ATMs or cash back at stores... ITS A DEBIT CARD FROM A CHECKING ACCOUNT!...only there's no physical bank.

So...after ALL the waiting, I was told they could not save my info, give me an appointment, or help me in any way. I would have to start over completely on Monday. Everything I did today and all the waiting counts for NOTHING! They can't give me an appointment. They CAN'T (won't?) even do what they did for my boyfriend at the VERY BEGINNING OF THIS MONTH and let me pick up where I left off by going to the licensing window on Monday instead of waiting in the initial line that was all the way outside and down the entire length of the building.

Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I've been here 5 other times and NEVER had to wait more than an hour or two tops...4+hrs is pathetic! Hardly any workers until the very end of the day. If they had been working as fast and hard the whole day as they were at 5....it would have been a much faster experience.
to know they HAVE THE CAPACITY to be that efficient, BUT CHOOSE NOT TO is the reason I am so disgusted by the unnecessarily loooonnngggg wait and the overall visit today.</review>

Got here at 7am waited for it to open at 8am. 4th in line for a if renewal and everyone is going before me. I even filled out the online registration before going in. I’m g10 and they just got to g3 after a half our of being open. Guess being early does not help at all.</review>

Making it seem it was my wife's fault for not checking before submitting it to a DMV worker. We both told her that my wife did check during that time and she did put West instead of North and there must be a mistake DMV did. She didn't care to listen to us told my wife to pay the fee. We both had enough and I told my wife that just pay the $29 fee since they don't care about who mistake it was. The DMV worker probably got butt-hurt and told me to sit because it's not my transition .

<Review>Good experience. I never thought I'd ever write a glowing review about a DMV but here it is. I had an appointment and I glided right through. Everyone was really nice and I would say even warm. Only one female employee had that detached DMV worker demeanor, but it wasn't mean, just detached.  It's been 10 years since my last visit to this DMV branch and I remember back then they made me feel like I was an invader in their living room. But this time I actually felt like they were just cool with seeing me. I think the change in quality of service has to do with the racial make up of the employees. Every employee I saw here was Latino and almost every person obtaining DMV services was Latino also. So I think that made a HUGE difference. Face it, Fresno is known for racism against Latinos. It isn't a reach to say that just maybe the previous, and mostly Caucasian employees, were taking their prejudices to work.  But that's all gone now and what's left here is a flowing and painless environment.  Cool!< /Review>< Pictures>

Worst service ever. The people that work there are rude and disrespectful. They treat everyone like idiots. If you want to be treated like trash; this is the place to go.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>1-3 hour wait for walk in. 1 hour later,  still on G4 ( me G14). The Gs are the walk ins. 1 HOUR later not a single walk in helped. They had only helped 4 walk ins in the 40 minutes they had been open , yet all other letters in the 30s. How can you expect people to wait 3 hours? I guess you can't walk in to the dmv and expect to get any help without an appointment. You win dmv , will always make an appointment. However screw you for not helping people for 2-3 hours on what was said to be a 15 min situation.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This office is crap. before going in today I was told I only needed one proof of residency. after waiting four hours for my number to be called while wrestling a toddler , I was sent home empty-handed because someone over there in their office gave me bad information. I wasted my whole day at the office only to leave empty handed.< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very bad.
First, you need to fill out the application for a license renewal online, they are working with a minimum of staff, they offer you help but they are only about to fulfill their shift and collect their salary and nobody really helps you, they are not interested if you have or no computer or if you have a cell phone to fill out the application.
Second, you take them the documents after an hour of waiting to enter, you go in and they make you wait sitting for another hour when they attend to you and you give them all the documents they can't find you in the system and they ask if you got the application and if not the you filled up they send you to an area where there are computers and after queuing they tell you that the system is down.
Question? Whoever is sitting at the computer attending to him, the system does not crash and if I fill the application what is the function of the one who is sitting at the computer if I am doing the work of filling the application!
Is it just to verify that it is me with the documents?
Gentlemen, don't say you are here to help if you don't help.
Before the information was filled out on paper and we advanced with Eri technology with these people, you really don't see progress.
Conclusion, I do not recommend going to this place they will waste your time they are sitting with air conditioning and they do not care what you did to be able to be there, if you work if you asked permission if you have children or not.

(Original)
Muy mal.
Primero, se necesita llenar en línea la aplicación para una renovación de licencia, están trabajando con un mínimo de personal, te ofrecen ayuda pero solo están por cumplir con su turno y cobrar su salario y  nadie realmente te ayuda, ellos no les interesa si tienes o no computadora o si tienes celular para llenar la aplicación.
Segundo, le llevas los documentos después de una hora de estar esperando para entrar, entras y te hacen esperar sentado por otra hora cuando te atienden y le das todos los documentos no te encuentran en el sistema y preguntan si llegastes la aplicación y si no la llenaste te mandan a una área donde hay computadoras y después de hacer la fila te dicen q el sistema está caído.
Pregunta? El que está sentado en la computadora atendiendo a él, el sistema no se le cae y si lleno la aplicación cuál es la función del que está en la computadora  sentado si le estoy haciendo el trabajo de llenar la aplicación!
Es solo verificar que si soy yo con los documentos?
Señores no digan que están para ayudar si no ayudan.
Antes la información se llenaba en papel y avanzamos con la tecnología Eri con esta gente realmente no se ve el avance.
Conclusión, no recomiendo ir a este lugar te harán perder tu tiempo ellos están sentados con aire acondicionado y ellos no les importa lo que hiciste para poder estar allí, si trabajas si pediste permiso si tienes hijos o no.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80946730a0f01d9d:0x4118d7eb48440b38< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Take two people to the driving tex.
But a driving instructor was very despotic from the first moment with the boy 👦
I treat him very badly, I intimate him from the beginning.
All the way through the driving text she scold him for what she considered to be wrong.
When you do the texting until they get to the DMV flyer they let you know what you did wrong.
They are driving instructors they are not his parents to go scolding us all he walked.
I don't know the name of the one who texted her but I'm upset.

Lleve a dos personas al tex de manejo.
Pero una instructora de manejo fue muy déspota desde el primer momento con el chico 👦
Lo trato muy mal lo intimidad desde un principio.
Todo el camino del tex de manejo lo regaño por lo que ella consideraba que hacia mal.
Cuando uno hace él  tex hasta que llegan al pasquín del DMV te dejan saber lo que hicistes mal.
Son instructores de manejo no son sus padres para irnos regañando todo él caminó.
Nose el nombre de la que le hizo el tex pero si estoy molesta.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A bad experience, some people who work there are kind but there are more pedants who believe they are the law and they are professionals and they are not. Ami did something horrible to me, I went to take an exam for license A and they didn't give me the punctuation they forgot. That same day I passed two Exams and one Faye put one pass and the other Faye but forgot to put two pass, DL C, knowledge or General and Combination ... the truth is a frustration that I can not forget this DMV ... I tell people who go there to be smarter and more cautious that these people who work there do not trust those who tell them to ask questions, and demand their rights. The truth one is confident that they are professionals and the truth that they lack a lot for that. The supervisor wanted to help me but could not, for reasons of feeding him, So still do not trust read the papers they give them and make sure you say what they say.

(Original)
Una mala experiencia, algunas personas que trabajan allí son algo amables pero hay más pedantes que se creen que son la ley y que son profesionales y no lo son.  Ami me hicieron algo horrible, yo fui hacer examen para licencia A y no me pusieron el puntuaje se les olvido. Ese mismo día pase dos Exámenes y uno Faye pusieron que uno pase y que el otro Faye pero se les olvidó poner que pase dos, la DL C, knowledge or General y Combination... la verdad es una frustración que no podré olvidar de este DMV... yo les digo alas personas que vayan allí sean más listos y caudalosos que estas personas que trabajan allí no se confíen alos que ellos les digan hagan preguntas, y exijan sus derechos. La verdad uno va confiado que ellos son profesionales y la verdad que les falta mucho para eso. El supervisor me quiso ayudar pero no pudo, por razones fedérale , Así que aún así no se confíen lean los papeles que les dan y asegúrense bien de lo que dicen.<//review>< Time>

(Translated by Google) Workers should be more committed to giving the service for which they are paid and not be around the clock just waiting and all the people waiting.

Los trabajadores deberían comprometerse mas a dar el servicio por el cual se les paga y no estar de un lado para otro nomas haciendo tiempo y toda la gente esperando.< /Text>
