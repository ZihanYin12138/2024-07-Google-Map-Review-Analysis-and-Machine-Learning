I am really big on customer service. The process of interacting with another, ideally knowledgable, human, is few & far between these days. The appeal of this process is what encouraged me to opt out of just doing in-store pick up, and speak directly to a sales associate to get an informed opinion about which printer I should purchase.  When I arrived, it seemed everyone was preoccupied with other guests and a long check out line. So I took myself to the printer section myself,  after doing my own initial research online to narrow it down.  I waited for someone to approach me, and finally an employee named Eric came to my aisle with a couple other guests he was wrapping up with.  Maybe he didn't notice me while I was trying to make eye contact with him,  but instead of acknowledging me and asking if I needed help,  he walked away. I was really trying to expedite the process of buying a printer & move on with my day,  so I went and tracked him down and asked if he was still helping those other guests.  He said he wasn't, so I proceeded to ask my questions.  I felt like I was bothering him,  so I rushed through my questions as to not take up too much of his time. After he walked away, I continued doing some research on the printers, and someone named Alex approached me. He was very kind,  and honest about his printer knowledge. His eagerness to help me (along with the woman who was likely a manager due to her different colored shirt) is the reason I'm leaving 4 stars instead of 1. The girl at checkout was very helpful as well. I just wish these employees at B&M stores understood that they play a big role in the customer service world, and should maybe get a desk job if they aren't up for the challenge of "dealing" with customers.<//Text>

<user_id>109198063443722201965< /user_id><review>This review is about a very helpful associate at the Copy Center at the Staples in Palm Springs.
For one reason or another my phone was not communicating with the copy machine in order to print my selected documents.
I hope I have the spelling correct...the employee by the name of Tianna, was amazing. She went above and beyond helpful and with her help I was able to print my documents and everything was good.< /review></record>

I went to the store on roming road to get my copies ,and also buy a new office printer. I arrived but needed to go to the restroom first. I found the restroom on my own. They had a code for the door.  I thought oh ill get the code and use the rest room. I had to get in line to get the darn code. When I made it to the front to finally get a code I was rudely informed that I needed to go back and wait at restroom for an employee to open the door for me. Ok someone finally showed up and let me in. I felt like a criminal and a child. Ok time for coppies. I wait in line again. Its finally my turn. I was told that they now have a new email and I had to resend my work. Than they will email me a code. Than I had to go to another line put in the code and do it myself. I asked if she could help me and she told me if she helps she had to charge me a service fee. I tried to resend from my phone. It would not work . Not a strong signal in the store.  I asked for the wifi passcode. She refused to give it to me. I saw no reason to spend 300 dollars on a new printer there. Im going to use vista print (like it said in the other bad review) in the future. I will call a real copy store to order my printer. WHAT A WAIST OF TIME FOR ME. PLEASE NEVER GO THERE TO WAIST YOUR TIME.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Their business card printer is poor quality for images (red like tone).  However they took care of it like a pro.  They made sure I wasn't charged for the inconvenience and ordered free cards sent from the factory.  Great service.  Great job Staples.</Text></record>

I use the copy center weekly and have had occasion to use the computer sales staff.  The local store and service is excellent.  The national support center sucks big time.  Once, when the copy machine I utilize was down, I had to shop at Office Depot.  It was then that I realized how good Staples was/is!</Review>

Just stay away from this place my three-year-old got bit up by ants so bad we almost had to take him to the hospital I overheard the neighbors speaking to the made of how they killed the bed bugs in the bed themselves there were cockroaches up by the office all three ice machines were broken down the pool was hot in the room was hot and when I complain to the guy manager he told me it's summertime the rooms are going to be hot. It blew his mind when I told him well maybe we wanted the motel room to escape the heat LOL. I stepped off the side of the sidewalk into the dirt and my feet came out with cat s*** and cat litter all over them because people just dump their cat litter boxes all over and then the motel staff leaves it there also the maids will get mad at you and tell on you for anything they find or think that you might be doing in the room that they don't like<//text>

Don't use the print services. Long waits on the phone long waits in line and when you finally do get a person there's no real service to be had. Such a waste take the extra time and deal with VistaPrint<//text>

I was browsing around the tablet section and a gentleman by the name of Alberto started helping me. He is very knowledgable about tablets and was able to answer all my questions thoroughly. I ended up getting the Nexus 7 which I'm very happy with. I was very satisfied with my shipping experience there. Ask for Alberto if you are shopping for tablets or computers.</Review>

I brought in my computer to have a scan check done on it because I was hacked a couple of months ago. I paid a fortune to an online tech group to get rid of the hackers,
Jose Pena, tech center supervisor was of great assistance to me, he detected viruses that the online techs did not get rid of, he tracked this company and found out they may not be a legit and he wrote a letter to Amex explaining the situation so that I can dispute those charges and get a refund. Best of all, I got my computer back in 24 hrs completely clean of viruses and this online tech company that overcharged me for unfinished and unsatisfactory service. I bought a 2 yr  protection service for my computer from Staples and I couldn't be happier.
Thank you, Jose Pena for excellent service and being a lifesaver!!!<//text>

I drove over an hour to get some supplies I needed for a conference/presentation call that I would be leading that night.  I needed a new mouse since mine stopped working.  I arrived and browsed, picking up several over items and then went to the counter.  The cashier was new and the manager was helping him make sure to do everything right... I assume.  When I arrived home, I began to unpack my staples purchases (only 1 paper bag full) and my $100 mouse was not among the merchandise!  I was so angry since this was something I would need in the next few moments.  I called Staples and spoke with the manager and they said I would have to drive back and get it.  I told him that was outrageous to expect me to spend $30 in gas to pick up the mouse that should have been in my bag!  I requested just to get a refund and he had me send him my receipt via email for him to take care of it. It's been 4 days now and I haven't heard a word from anyone. I called customer service and they couldn't do anything either.  So now I'm in my office with no mouse, am out $100 and it doesn't seem to be a big deal to Staples at all!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Called for information on laminating - put on hold for a considerable amount of time, then person who answered didn't have information so transferred me to another.   Meanwhile I called Office Depot on another line and they answered immediately and the person answering also had the information I needed.  Poor customer service at Staples.< /text>

Horrible. Just horrible the guys there do not know what customer service means. All I needed was just some color copies but nobody wanted to help. They even avoid eye contact so I wouldn't ask for help.  Pretending to be to busy staring at a screen. I went to FEDEX PRINT across the street and everybody was helpful and didn't treat me like I was a pain. I was out of there in three minutes not to mention THE COPIES ARE CHEAPER! thanks staples team. You just send me on the right direction< /text>

Terrible tech department. Talked to two people in the store who said it would only take a few hours to install my new SSD drive. Went in to pick it up that evening and was told that the computer hadn't been touched and it would take them at least three days. Needless to say I took my business elsewhere. I've been buying my computers there for ten years, and they blew all that goodwill in just a few hours.

And another thing. I tried all afternoon to reach a human on the phone in that store and ended up having to go in in person. Not acceptable. I'm done.< /Text>

Ordered from Cycle for the first time. The pizza was awesome. Definitely will consider ordering from Cycle next time we get pizza. I docked a star for not receiving the ranch or pepper flakes I had requested, nor an explanation of why they were not sent. If an extra charge was required for these items, I would have gladly paid, however they were not noticeable on their UberEATS menu, so I just added a note to the order, but it seems my note was ignored. I would have gladly accepted a text or call notifying me of extra charges or unavailability of my request, but there was zero communication and my requested extra was not received.< /text>

We got your order and there was no mention about ranch and cheese and pepper. Sometimes UberEats App is glitching. (Yesterday all day even) I can take a picture for you if needed. Ranch and peppers are available for sale in menu as extras, and even if you dont buy it we always do exception and send them , especially for first time customers. Sorry for this situation. Pls read our reviews and you will feel that in future, we are not the kind of cheap business owners. We always trying to do more than we use to. Pls next time leave a note , and everything will be done perfectly. I promise!'}</Response>< name>

Grabbed a medium pizza to try and my family loved it. Really great new local option after our favorite place closed. Can't wait to try again!</review>

<Text>Seriously pizza is awesome! I don't know if it's the cheese and the dough that's different but it's good. Haven't gotten pizza from anywhere else since I started going here.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>DROOLS AND YUUMMM!  Last night was my very 1st time trying out Pizza Cycle.  I ordered it through Uber's app and MY OH MY their PIZZA'S ARE TO DIE FOR!  I had ordered a Combination, Meat Lover's, and Pepperoni w / jalepenos and pineapples.  My husband and I tried each one and they were all very delicious!  Generous amount of CHEESE and love, love how cheesy all 3 pizzas were.  It was fresh, hot, and flavorful.  We're beyond satisfied with last night's order and plan on becoming one of their regulars.  Though a bit pricey on my end, I still highly recommend.  It'll be worth every dollar!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Very professional and quick!  I called to have one of my bedroom doors unlocked.  Daughter locked it and we couldn't find the key.  All city was quick and proficient.  He had me send a photo of the lock and he was able to tell me what he would be able to do.  He was here in ten minutes from the time I called. Very good service by Gary. Will definitely use again if needed.<//review>< pics>

Impressive! All City Locksmith is professional and courteous. They arrive on time and did quality work. I had my new home re-keyed and they were very efficient. They are so good, that I have already recommended them to my co-workers at Kaiser. All City Locksmith has been a pleasure to deal with! All City Locksmith has made the transition to my new home easy ! Thank you!

One convenient key for my entire home!< /Text>

Front doorknob fell apart so I had Gary take a look at fixing it (it was a nice doorknob set). He came out on a Saturday morning, fixed it quickly (not an easy Alen wrench type fix) and charged a reasonable rate. This is the second time I have used him. He is timely, reasonable and knowledgeable.</text>

Gary is the best hands down! I was not happy with quotes I got from local locksmiths for a residential room lockout until I called Gary. I recall using him before and so glad I got him again! He was quick and cheap for the quality service and advice he provides and now on my speed dial. Don't waste your time going anywhere else!< /text>

Just had All City Locksmith come out today (6 Aug 2020). He was extremely knowledgeable and the service was quick. Changed all locks on our new home and made extra keys for my family. Total charge was only $73. I don't know if anyone can beat that. I called a couple other places and they wanted a minimum of $135. I definitely recommend All City.</text>

Gary was a pleasure to work with, fair prices, good work, and very straightforward. He was able to schedule around my  day, was easy to get a hold of, and was able to give us options for everything we needed. Cool guy, will definitely use again.</review>

<text>My old key broke inside the lock and it was my only access to my office building. I panicked and rushed to yelp to find a local locksmith. I was worried of how much this was going to cost me but I had no other choice. I called Gary at All City and he came incredibly quick, worked his magic and got me back inside. He re-keyed the doors and priced the job very reasonably. I have found my go-to locksmith! Thanks so much Gary!</text><Rate>5<//Rate><username>Ruben Zaldivar</username>< Time>

I wish I could give All City Locksmith more than 5 stars! If you’re looking for an honest man to help you with keys or any other related services, Gary is the first person you should call! Today he helped me replace two car keys for my Honda Accord at an amazing price that will beat any other business. I certainly will continue to come back and refer my friends and family.<//Review>

We contacted Gary and he was here at our facility within 30 minutes. He re-keyed our Front & Back Doors and provided additional keys for over half of what we had paid last year to have the same thing done . I would Highly Recommend him and his company.

If you need a locksmith for commercial or residential, All City is the best out there. Our cleaning crew accidentally locked us out of the office at the gym we own. 20 minutes after calling All City, we are in and back to business as usual. Super fast, professional and competitively priced. Call All City before you waste your time on anyone else!<//Review>

All I can say is wow. I have dealt with other locksmiths, but will never use them again. This guy is perfect. His prices for re-keying my Dad's house were amazing. On time, professional and nice. Highly recommend.<//Review>

<review>I used their service looking at the five star reviews they really deserve it
Gary is very thorough, very professional, polite,  respectful, prompt, finishes the job quickly is very experienced in all kinds of locks.  Who is the local hardware stores for locks that are not found in the regular Lowe’s and Home Depot .
He gives you choices via text messages so you can save money he sends you pictures and is able to pick up the item from store for you

He uses the iPhone, replies text right away even when it’s after-hours sometimes
I love it!
No other locksmith is this easy to reach and this affordable.
He even told me that I could do replace the lock myself as it’s simple and save money
He Sent me video on it
Who does that?
Thanks Gary  hope you get to expand your business we need Locksmiths like you.<//review>< pics>

<Review>All City Locksmith is the place to call. Gary was amazing. I needed to have my house rekeyed ASAP. He was there in less than an hour, and went above and beyond. His price was extremely reasonable. I will recommend him to anyone that needs a locksmith and he will be the only locksmith I use from now on.< /Review>< Pics>

As a college student working part time I was very worried when half of my key broke off and got stuck in the ignition. Not only was the process easy and quick but it was incredibly affordable. The quote he gave me literally half the price of competitors. Great guy, great service, would 100% recommend!!< /review><pics>None< /pics><user>111689938376881305025<//user>< GmapID>

My old key broke inside the lock and it was my only access to my office building. I panicked and rushed to yelp to find a local locksmith. I was worried of how much this was going to cost me but I had no other choice. I called Gary at All City and he came incredibly quick, worked his magic and got me back inside. He re-keyed the doors and priced the job very reasonably. I have found my go-to locksmith! Thanks so much Gary!<//text>

Even asked my husband if he wanted to watch him so he could learn how it’s done. Also re-keyed all doors. Everything works great!  Prices Very reasonable! Thank You!!!!!</Review><resp>{'time': 1542030230775, 'text': 'Thank you for using our services.'}</resp><rating>5< /rating><date>1540904631534<//date>< username>

I called All City Locksmith to rekey my residence. He showed up and got to work, didn’t waste his or my time. Because of that I had to call him out a second time to rekey the business. Same experience second go around. Showed up and got the job done with no problems. Will definitely call back when needed</Review>

Just had Gary from All City Locksmith out to rekey and he did an excellent job. He was quick and efficient and the price was excellent. We just moved into the neighborhood and we asked around for a locksmith. All City came highly recommended and I can see why. Great work! We will be calling them for all our key needs for sure.<//Review>

Quick service and very professional. He gave us a couple different options on what could be done to re-key our home. Options make me happy!!! He was in and out in about 30 mins with a very fair price. Would definitely recommend.<//text>

<text>This is the second time Gary helped me. Never a failure to satisfy his clients. I’m getting married and with lots of expenses. Gary helped me save a lot of money fixing my car key which is a fraction of what I will pay if I have to go to dealership. Hardwares can’t replace or even fixed my car key.

Thanks Gary. Now I can confidently give my key to my friend who will drive me on my old Honda CRV going to the church. No more shabby looking car key 🔑🙏🏻.< /text><Date>1554270509932<//Date>< Rating>

When I noticed I locked my keys in my car I was really concerned about how much it would cost or whether I would be scammed. Thankfully I chose All City Locksmith and their price for the unlock was reasonable and they were quick. Gary was really friendly and professional, I would definitely recommend their services to friends.< /review>

Can't open my door as my key got stuck in the lock. Search online and found good reviews of All City Locksmith. it was 5:00 pm and its website said its closed. I just tried to call and Gary answered my call promptly. After only 20 minutes, he was in my home and fixed everything. Great service and great price. Gary is very polite and nice.<//Text>

FAST, EFFICIENT, REASONABLE

Gary's same day service for a nine lock re-key was performed in a logical, efficient manner, taking less than an hour to complete!.

Gary was also very generous with his explanation of what his was doing, while executing the re-keying process.

And the cost...I was expecting at least double the cost of what he charged!

As an owner/operator, Gary was able to accept business calls, answer questions, while performing my re-keying project. A FANTASTIC multi-tasker!

The entire process was worthy of 10 stars!</Text>

<Text>I was moving into a new home and needed fast affordable service to rekey all the locks in the home.  I contacted Gary and was able to setup for a 3pm that same day service after verifying my address and proof of residency.  He arrived on site and was able to remove a very old lock and rekey all the other door locks for a very reasonable price.

I had previously reached out to check other locksmiths for price and service including AAA recommended locksmiths which were all more expensive but Gary was able do everything and more for the same price he originally qouted me.  It's hard to find good quality service for a reasonable price. \I will be happy to recommend him to family, friends and use Gary for all my future lock issues.

He saved me about $75 in new locks by just rekeying (new keys, not replacments but he does that too) instead of replacing the whole complete locks unecessarily.

Thanks again Gary!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Gary does great work! he showed up at my house on time. He had one key out of 10 keys switched out within 5 minutes very nice. He gets right to work and gets it done really fast also does a little extra work like  using WD40 on my doors with out asking. Looking forward to using him for my other projects...< /text><Date>1437694363878< /Date></record>

Gary is great locksmith in Rancho
Cucamonga. He gave excellent service when I called him to install lock at my business. He promptly visited the site, identified the problem and drove back to store to get new lock. His initiative saved my time to visit shop to get right locks for office door. Later he installed new locks and they work perfect. He is very friendly, efficient and reasonable.< /text>

<Text>We recently moved out to Rancho Cucamonga and needed change out the locks on the house.  After pricing new locks, we decided to go with re-keying the house instead.  Being new in the area, we didn't know who to call and we had no recommendations.  I found this guy on Yelp and decided to take a chance (as with any new service).  Gary answered my call promptly and scheduled an appointment to re-key my house within a couple hours of calling him.  He showed up on time and did a fantastic job!  Extremely professional and very reasonable pricing.  Highly recommended! - Thanks Gary!!</Text></record>

<review>We recently moved out to Rancho Cucamonga and needed change out the locks on the house.  After pricing new locks, we decided to go with re-keying the house instead.  Being new in the area, we didn't know who to call and we had no recommendations.  I found this guy on Yelp and decided to take a chance (as with any new service).  Gary answered my call promptly and scheduled an appointment to re-key my house within a couple hours of calling him.  He showed up on time and did a fantastic job!  Extremely professional and very reasonable pricing.  Highly recommended! - Thanks Gary!!<//review><resp>{'time': 1407857082331, 'text': 'Thanks for the Review George'}<//resp><userid>100276940583664520056<//userid>< Date>

Update 3/17/2018

Gary is back at it again with quick service and great attitude.  He was able to provide me with a quote over the phone and came by 20 minutes  after hanging up.

Thank you Gary!

-------Previous review--------

Gary was great.  I called to get a quote and he did it over the phone, he was able to come over right away and finished rekeying 6 locks within an hour.  He was a very friendly guy and worked quickly.  Also his prices are lower than other locksmiths I called even with their coupons.

If you need a locksmith don't hesitate to call All city locksmith!< /text>

We decided to change our locks on the day we moved into our new home, Gary met us at our new home, was early, and was very helpful. It was very busy with the movers working at the same time, but Gary was very accomodating and worked around us. More importantly, he was really pleasant and understanding. He even took a door handle off for me that wasn't even where he was working and refused to let me pay him for it. Fantastic service and a bright spot on an otherwise stressful day.

<time>1405536248265< /time><rating>5</rating><Review>I was looking all over the internet for a trustworthy locksmith, until I bumped into All City Locksmith. I called for services of rekeying my front door lock, of the home I moved into. Gary who answered was polite and informative, and was able to come out the same day I called wasting no time. Real cool guy. He saw my lock, and knew exactly what to do. He even went the extra step of making all the locks (only two) match the same key. So that I don't have different keys to get into my house. He was fast, nice and pleasant. I truly do recommend him for any of your locksmith needs. I'm just a regular guy who found a great locksmith. I hope this helps with your decisions. Take care and God bless.< /Review>< pictures>

I locked myself out of the house yesterday (3/27/17), no house/car keys - I know,  I know!  My spares were locked up, I needed to get to work, and my HO Insurance company was no help! I called a couple well known places in the Riverside area... They all wanted $90 and up... And they could be there within a FEW hours!

So went on another site/app and found a couple places, sent out requests; got a couple instant responses but they wanted more than $100 & it would be to 2-4 hours before they could come.  Then along came Gary & All City!  He was able to give me a quote that was FAR below everyone else's (almost half)  AND he said he could be there within about an hour!!! I thought it was too good to be true... but NO additional fees, charges,  mileage/travel costs... and he accepts cards!

I just texted him my address & a picture of the lock.  From there he provided updates on his location/arrival time,  right until he pulled up to the house.  I'll include a snapshot of the messages. I contacted him around 8:30a.. he was finishing another job and heading over by 8:46a... and was at the house before 9:30!!!

When he arrived he was nice & polite, but worked quickly!! Amazingly quick!!! The price never changed and I was on my way to work within an hour!!!

As you'll see from the screenshot, I've  already added his number to my phone for future reference.  He really came through when I was in panic mode & dreading this unexpected expense.  He's hardworking, friendly, honest & reliable!  Locksmith needs??... CALL GARY!!!

And NO, I'm not a friend/relative and had never used his services until yesterday. It's just difficult & rare to find companies/people like this! :)<//Text>

Went to Pepboys, Walmart, Home Depot, and etc. to get an extra key for my vehicle. None of them had it. Called the dealership and they gave me a quote, then I called Gary and he gave me a far better one. Showed up to my house and did the work on about 5 minutes. Couldn't have been happier. Great price, incredible convenience.</Review>

{'time': 1425702537694, 'text': "Yes, I removed the lock because you didn't pay me. Instead, you kept playing games, saying you lost your checkbook in the mail? You manage Victorias Secret (a trillion dollar company) how on earth could you have no money in your bank? Then, you come up with even more excuses, saying, we need a company order faxed in, and a worker approve the work before we can pay you, plus we don't have any $ to pay you. Yet the store was crowded with a line of customers. If I would have known this first, I would have never taken this job.\n\nAt the end of the day, I was promised pay, which didn't happen. I tried calling and texting Monty, but, this time he didn't answer. Yes, I  took the lock off and was very happy that I did it. You tried making a fool out of me, but it didn't work out so well for you, so all you can do is give me a 1 star rating. Shame on you.\n\nThe next morning all of a sudden there is money in their bank account (Somehow his checkbook was never lost, but was playing me all this time to work for free) I rejected his payment. I don't do business like that and don't want your business in the future.\n\nI deal with many people, I would have never thought in a million years that Victorias Secret would pull something shady like this.\n\nWho's unprofessional and breaking the law now??"}</Response>
<text>Terrible, complete lack of professionalism, I called him from out of state to replace a lock on a door at a store I manage and because I didn't pay him within a few hours with my credit card he went back to the store and removed the lock....which is against the law!  Now he refuses to return my call and I am paying someone else to do his job after I paid him in full without knowing he had removed the lock< /text>< UserId.>

I love Noah's Bagels. This location is neat because it is up the street from Manhattan Beach. However, beware, the wait here could get apocalyptic if you order a breakfast sandwich (sometimes 30-45 minute wait from the moment you get in line to when you actually receive your order).<//review>

After my morning runs along Manhattan beach and Hermosa, I’ll always stop here to get the vege bagel. Simply delicious with toasted everything bagel.</review>

As a transplant from NY, I have to give Noah's a "meh" rating. They are a step or two above prepacked grocery store bagels, but still fall squarely in the category of bread rolls. My memory of Noah's from years ago is that the bagels had a lot more attitude. They seem to have mellowed with time. Still, they are my closest decent perveyor of bagels, so they are worth the 7 mile round trip bike ride from Redondo Beach.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><review>I really enjoy this place. The bagels are always on point never disappointed. You can ask for a sample of the cream cheese if you want to taste before you purchase. Make sure your clear on your order so that you don't get an error. Felton is a GREAT MANAGER! If your a regular or gets know your name he treats you like royalty. Keep up the great work team members!<//review><Date>1507687879934< /Date>< Pics>

<Text>I personally love Noah's. The bagel selection is vast and the staff is super friendly. I love it's central location downtown because although there isn't much room to sit and eat, there's plenty to walk around and see. Great spot.< /Text>< resp>

<review>Good, standard bagels and friendly staff make this place comfortable to visit. The shop is clean, and the outdoor space usually has seats to sit at. It's never too crowded here, but it does get busy. The coffee is good, and the bagels themselves do have that North East/New England feel to them. If you're craving a toasted bagel with cream cheese washed down with coffee while in Manhattan Beach, Noah's Bagels is your best bet!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b3ecf26e1f1b:0xc1ced30474e283e2</GmapID></record>

Wow! Our experience was great. The staff was super friendly and acomidating, giving the store a casual and familiar atmosphere. The food was very taste and authentic, leading us to come back again on our 4 day vacation. I don't usually leave reviews, but they really diserved it. 5 stars.</text>

We had an 8 hour lay over at LAX before traveling back to the Netherlands. Decided to have breakfast at Manhattan Beach and took an Uber to Noah’s after reading all the positieve reviews. The bagels were delicious, as well as our cappuccino’s and strawberry banana smoothie. Surrounded by all our luggage we were asked whether we had a lay over and were given 4 different bagels to ease the pain. What a super nice gesture!! We enjoyed eating them and will definitely return on our future travels!< /Review>

The food is sooo delicious!
We had the Chicken Club, Blueberry Muffins, Chocolate Cookies and Brownies.
The staff is tremendous friendly and helpful. And Felton, the manager is such a great guy! We told him, we are going to LAX and he additionally packed some bagels for the flight in our bag. For free!
LOVELY! <3< /Text>< response>

Both times the food was great I always have the locks and bagels and cream cheese. Every time the food has been great and the prices are very reasonable as well. Coffee is about two dollars but if you bring in your own cup it's only a dollar and you can get refills all day long.

What really makes the visits here great is the great customer service that the wife and I receive. I would like to make mention of the manager his name is Felton and he is top notch. Very nice and pleasant person it is on top of everything.

I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again and I advise all who visit Noah's Bagels to say hello to the manager Mr. Felton he will definitely take care of you I promise.<//text><Time>1482162154883< /Time>< user_id>

Good work, straight forward with the price and willing to communicate if something changes. They are always busy so plan ahead and get there early. Highly recommended.< /text>

< review>
I looked up this place on Google because I was looking for a oil change on both of my cars on my day off and it had enough good reviews for me to go check it out. I go with my daily (Kia Forte) to get an conventional oil change and since it's nearby where I live, I also inquire about a full synthetic oil change for my weekend high performance vehicle (Mitsubishi Lancer Evo). The man in charge proceeds to quote me both conventional motor oil for my Kia and Frams Full Synthetic for my Evo. I wasn't so sure about Frams so I tell him I normally put Mobil 1 but let me think about it. A good ten to fifteen minutes the later the same man comes up to me and says that they did full synthetic oil change on my Kia when I specifically said conventional. I was only inquiring about it for my other vehicle but I understand an honest mistake so I say it's ok and ask them to do a full synthetic change in my Evo which I will come back with at the regular oil price and the man agrees. At this point I told the man the nature of my Evo being a high performance vehicle and gave him full disclosure yet when I come back with it for the agreed upon full synthetic oil change, he tells me the cars too low to go on the floor lifter or his flat bay with a floor jack. He denies me service and recommends I go to jiffy lube. I would not have written this review if the man did what I asked him to do correctly on my Kia but the fact that they make a mistake then denies me service afterwards is not good. I'm giving 2 stars because they were quick to do the change and prices are good. But it's not acceptable in the service industry to say one thing then change it around the next. I hope the next person gets better than that.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This store is definitely not recommended, it will definitely earn you a lot. The service attitude is good, but the price is not fair. The engine service soon light of my car turned on, and it said it was going to check and charge 45. After the inspection, the thermostat and gasket should be replaced, a total of 250 plus inspection 45. Fart. I think it’s too expensive to drive to Liu En to repair the car. It takes less than a minute to check out the problem with a machine connected to the car’s computer. The free inspection only charges materials and labor. The inspection here costs $45. Liu En finally calculated that the materials and labor combined were much less than him. Let's put it this way, going to Liu En to repair the car will cost at least half less than going here. The smiling tiger is the one who kills the most. If you live near San Gabriel, please go to Liu En to repair the car. I am grateful to Master Liu and hope that his business will get better and better.

这家店绝对不推荐，能多赚的绝不少赚你。服务态度好，但价格不公道。我车的engine service soon灯亮了，说是要检查收45。检查完说要换恒温器和垫片一共250外加检查45。屁嘞。我嫌贵开到刘恩修车，人家用个机器连到汽车电脑不到一分钟就检查出问题而且免费检查只收材料加人工，这里检查还要$45。刘恩最后算了材料和人工加起来比他少多了。这么说吧去刘恩修车至少比到这里少花一半钱。笑面虎才是最宰客的，住在San Gabriel 附近的请去刘恩修车吧，我是对刘师傅心存感激希望人家生意越来越好。< /Text><Date>1600456724762< /Date>< response>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Do Smog check, if you can't do it, you will tell you in advance; it can be done very quickly, about 20 minutes, the boss is quite good.

做Smog check，如果不能做，会事先告诉你；能做的时候很快，20分钟左右吧，老板人挺好的。<//Text><user_name>SH L<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

Nice park. Lots of space. Good for groups. Kids loved running through the playground. I wish there were more benches around the play area to better observe the kids playing.<//text>

<Review>Parking is limited and even if you do find parking, you park with the risk of getting your car damaged due to a foul ball from the softball games being played. Aside from that, it's okay but the area is a little rough.< /Review><userid>105222495272733706247<//userid>< rating>

I'm at this park right now. I noticed that many parks in Orange county have closed their restrooms during this quarantine even though the park is open. That is only helping the virus to spread because many homeless people depend on parks to use the toilet and wash themselves & the people who are taking walks can't wash their hands either. Whoever thinks closing the restrooms in the few public places that are open is a good idea, is only doing more harm.<//review>

<text>The guy was super cool and helpful.no rudeness at all. There reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because their juice variety was very small. And I mean VERY! Don't get me wrong though this place has a lot of potential. Also I agree with that the other guy said about the testers, it's true.</text><user_id>113174801785688101523<//user_id><name>Steve C<//name>< date>

Service is cool but the testers suck seems like they barely work. Where ever they get there juice from suck has no flavor what so ever. The prices are high. I'm not going back.</Text>

< Review>
Best Vape Shop in San Bernardino hands down. Great customer service, with a wide selection. Went in with a couple questions and they took care of me and then some. Went home very happy. Thank you Ace of Vapes see you again soon.</Review>

<review>I came into this vape shop for the first time. They told me the prices for 3 bottles of juices was $30. When they rang me up, it came out to be $39. That means they ridiculously charge 30% for tax here. I told them that tax in Highland is not this high. They didn't seem to care and decided to charge me it anyways. Don't let them scam you.< /review><username>Long Nguyen< /username>< userid>

This vape shop is the best, friendly employees who are very knowledgeable. I go here regularly for all my vaping needs, ive had more than one occurance where being down to my last 10-15$ they have worked with me to help me get my vape juice. Either by just dropped 5$ off one of their bottles or one time the manager even gifted me a bottle of their house juices which are really good to be honest. This place is the best i highly recommend going here for any and all vape needs</Text>

Customer service is is our top priority so I’m not sure what went wrong but I do apologize for that. As for pricing, we’ve recently lowered our prices to compete with the market.

The main worker a guy who looked like a viking was being a complete jerk to not only his coworker, but also the customers. Kicking the cans away from the next customer. Throwing items he deemed not recyclable back at the customers almost hitting me with them & yelling hurry up.

<review>Just turned in 119 worth of cans, bottles. The guys there were very friendly and helpful. They were able to take care of me, with a full truck load, and still help all the people that came in with little amount. I got a fair price.

My son and I come here to recycle. It's about what you'd expect for a recycling joint. Fairly fast service, but they do work on a strict schedule, meaning when their break time comes, you gotta wait!< /Text>

Terrible first and last impression. Man bun in Rocklin by Walmart barks at me when I pull up at 1:45 they're going to lunch come back at 3 and walks away. Both of you? Don't stagger your lunches? And for an hour and 15 minutes? Slightly closer to my house but will stick to the  place in north highlands that's open on Sunday until 2 they act like they are running a business. Again first and last time I have been there.<//text>

I had a full garbage can of plastic bottles I put through the do-it-yourself machine. They took the same amount and showed me I would have gotten $9 more dollars if I recycled by weight! Plus it's a lot more work to use the machines! Live and learn! Make sure your recycling is sorted cuz they won't take co-mingle.< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I tried the Pacific Avenue, Rocklin location next to Walmart.  Very slow would be an improvement.  People were lined up 8 deep.  After a truck changed out recycle trailers two of the THREE employees disappeared in the back.  The third swept and stood around doing nothing.  The people in the front of the line said that they had been there nearly one hour.  Two people left because of the wait.  After 35 minutes I left.   In that time not one bottle or can was processed.< /review></record>

The fact that the lady down below thinks he was the jerk, is indicative of the attitude of the people in Rocklin. So glad I don't work in the service industry there anymore, the majority of people in that town treat you like garbage. This place is as good as recycle centers get. A lot better than Berry St. where the guy yells at you at the time. Get over yourself, Rocklin.</text>

<review>Been using this location for sometime and have been very pleased, until today... It is a joke that they will only pay a quarter of a penny for glass even though their sign says 10 cents.
They are npt a recycle center but a crv reimbursement center. Glass is glass, clear or collored is the only difference and I may be wrong but in recycling I dont believe that is even a major factor, but again I coyld be wrong.
It is not all about the $$ but really the principal of the whole thing.<//review>< Pics>

Took this lady damn near 30 mins to just open up me and several of the customers were wondering why she doesn't open early to take care of paperwork... Jessica was very friendly tho but they could work on punctuation I will not be visiting this site again I'll drive to Sacramento ... This is my 3rd time here and every time I have to wait for her to do something that has no relation to the job this time was her to finish her cig</review>

I visited the Torrance store in December, 2020 and ordered 3 counter stools. It was a custom order and the sales associate, Charlotte was realistic in telling me that I would probably receive them in mid-March. Crate and Barrel kept me informed on the status and  they were delivered exactly as promised in March. The quality of the leather upholstery is excellent and they are beautiful, comfortable and well made. The Torrance store makes shopping safe and inspiring and Charlotte is very helpful. I will be shopping for more furniture there this spring.<//Review>

There are rude employees. I asked one of employee, Felisa (I remembered her name) about the product I was interested in. And she just walked away after she said “6 feet apart”. Didn’t say anything and just walked away. I wasn’t even close to her... she just ignored me. felt so weird and upset...< /Review>

I've picked up a few items over some time and the associates have always been helpful and courteous. Items were always ready to be picked up when I got there. Their selection of items is great as well. From home furniture to kitchen items, there's always nice things to look at and add to your home.</review></record>

<text>Way too expensive considering the current climate, staff were snobby and not very well trained regarding the origins of the products and materials, cookie cutter customer service wrecked the rest of the shopping experience, I walked out without purchasing anything. This place has really gone downhill. I won't be back for Christmas gifts this year. I surmise they are having "restructuring" issues in executive management and "its" (flowing downhill).<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Store is taking orders for items as if they will be delivered within the month then delays add multiple months to timeline. Brand has lost my trust and I will no longer be shopping here.<//Review>< Time>

I had an unpleasant experience today, I went in to return an online item when the cashier with red hair immediately said she can’t do returns with an attitude. She was unwilling to help and mention there was nothing she can do because all C&B systems were down. However I received a different experience at a different C&B, the girl was very helpful and although she explained the system was not working and would take longer she was able to assist me.< /Text>

Staff is not helpful. Yael promised she will take care of all details. When the dresser was not delivered as promised, she  just referred us to Customer Service - by TEXT, and never followed up! Emma, in customer service acted as if it was my fault that the dresser was not delivered. She was rude and not helpful. After all of that, this morning, Sunday, at 7 AM, I get a call from the delivery service that the dresser is not in the warehouse and won't be delivered today.!  have had better service from discount furniture stores than this supposedly high-end retailer. I won't buy a spatula from them if I needed one to save my life!</Text>

Had a horrible past few experiences at this location.  Both times I could not get help to locate an item.  Today the gentleman with glasses at the counter did everything he could to avoid assisting me.  Very rude and very disgusting unprofessional behavior.  I used to enjoy this place but the pompous, self exports to and pretentious employees are always the worst to deal with.  They judge people based on their appearance or wether or not they appear to be able to afford the items there. I was looking to buy a set of wusthof knives and the staub perfect pan for my girlfriend.  Instead I had to go down to sur la table in el segundo to get the help I deserved.<//review>

Everything went wrong with this company. I still have no furniture and points that I had earned were taking away from me from mistakes they did. They kept telling me that they will fix it and call me when they had it fix. I had to be on top of them to see if they were doing there job. I just wish that I could go back in time and never had done business with this company.</review>

Be sure to check their clearance section, as they sometimes have really good deals on items they want to clear out.< /text>< user>

Great experience!
The team working here were so nice and helpful .

My daughter picked out some shoes .
Our plan was to pick out white ones then go home to the dye them .
Make them her own style.
She did and the turned out great !
Highly recommend< /review>

The staff is always friendly! The price is also great when they run % discount. Selection is kind of a hit or miss, depending on your sizes. Definitely worth checking this store out.<//Text>

Good deals, but if you look closely at two pairs of the same shoes they very slightly. Im concerned the build quality might very as well.<//Text>

Interesting selection, definitely not all the top of the line products. Still, worth a look and if you are lucky you can pick up some good kicks and maybe for a heavy discount.<//Review>

Got 5 pairs of converse shoes from this shop. There was a huge collection, and they had discounts, so it was very cheap but good quality. The cashier was not friendly at all. She was very rude.< /review>

(Translated by Google) A great variety and good prices. Also in the purchase of a pair I received one free. The only thing I didn't like is the store staff, they don't give you any help.

Una gran variedad y buenos precios. Además en la compra de un par recibí uno gratis. Lo único que no me gustó esque el personal de la tienda, no te brinda ninguna ayuda.< /text>

< Review>
Everything was nicely done, I did the quick pick up and there were several cars to choose from and the drop off was just as quick.  While this is important the most is the people, they were friendly and helpful.  Today customer service is a surprise rather than a norm and I was pleasantly surprised.  Only comment is to squeegee the windows & side mirrors instead of a towel drying.  The towel leaves towel spots and in the sunlight is fine but in the evening with car lights they do make things harder to see and since I'm in an area I'm unfamiliar with visibility if key.  Otherwise the interior was perfect but I'm picky on my windows<//Review>

<review>National Car Rental has the easiest rental process of any car rental company.  You make your reservation and when you get there, you just walk right out to the lot, choose your car and drive to the exit.  Hand them your license and you are good to go.  I always like to get something fun to drive when I travel and the Dodge Challenger fit the bill.  They also had a wide selection of more 'reasonable" cars, mid size trucks and SUV's to choose from.  Prices change but I was able to rent this car for just over $40 a day.  My only complaint is with the quantity of vehicles available during peak times.  Every company that rents there doesn't seem to have enough vehicles to satisfy the demand.<//review>< pics>

I love the fact I can walk down an aisle and pick the car I want as an  Emerald Club member!  Each person we dealt with was personable and helpful.  We got off our flight, got to the rental center, walked straight to the Emerald Club aisle, picked a car, drove off, showed our license at the gate and were gone.  Literally a 5 minute process!  Amazing!< /review>

But today it's different.  I have been asking for Nat'l to have their drivers that return cars to the lot lower the seats because I always hit my head when entering the car. And to this day! Nothing has ever been done.
Also the car was washed, but still wet over all the windows plus inside windows were dirty.  There was mud on the floor door jam that should have been cleaned prior to delivering the car.
This is not an isolated incident!  I travel the Western US and only use Nat'l. This seems to be at most of the rental yards. Cars not cleaned, Seats not lowered and the biggest pet peeve is the tank is not full when i select a car.  This has only happened twice in 7.5 years.
I hope management sees this and acts instead of sending a nice response letter.
I am a loyal customer and always will be. But i need to vent today! Thanks< /review>< Pics>

<review>Horrible service!  Changed rental reservation price at pick up.  I have been emerald elite with National for more than 10 years, never had problem like the one I did at SMF.  Reservation was made a month before, and when driving out from Emerald aisle, I was told the rate would change unless I can show proof of the contract.  I had the contract ID in profile for years through alumni association, did not have any proof at 9pm when my family is in the car.  The agent, Carlos and his supervisor Gianni are rude and condescending, claiming there have been a lot of fraud, when my family travel in first class and it's a 2-day rental!  I told him it’s the principle that if you questioned my contract let me know when the reservation is made, not when I am already driving out.  I could have easily use AAA or some other contract, instead of paying rate without any.

I would never rent from National SMF again.  It brought a bad start to our vacation, gave National and Sacramento an abhorrent image!  Go with anyone else in SMF.< /review><GmapID>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566< /GmapID>< Date>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I arrived to pick up the car at 7 a.m.  There were several pickups available, but I knew how much luggage I had and I really wanted to be able to lock it up since I would be driving for 12 hours.  Andrew Tang was working in the National Car Rental booth and I asked if there was a minivan available.  He went out of his way to find me a minivan and I was on my way within 10 minutes of arrival.  He was very professional, very helpful and when I drove away, National Car Rental had a very happy customer.  National Rental Car should value Andrew as an employee because he provided service that will make customers return to National Rental Car.  He is invaluable!</Review>< Pictures>

I can’t say enough about this National station. In general National is awesome. The folks at Sacramento are the best. Nothing but great customer service and experiences. Anytime there is a small issue it’s addressed on site.  I e encountered Brian Hitchcock a few times and this guy needs to be promoted! He knows his customers and takes care of them. I recently had an issue with an overdue car and Brian and. Melissa sorted it out for me in no time. I doubt I’d get the same response from Hertz or Avis. Keep up the great work!< /text>

<text>Reservations are easy, employees are Pros, prices are good, transactions -- picking up/returning -- couldn't be easier.  I was a loyal Hertz customer for 15 years, then National beat Hertz at their own game.  I'm not denigrating Hertz - they're excellent.  But National is better.<//text>< pictures>

Being an Emerald member through my credit card I booked a premium car for pickup at Sacramento airport.  When I arrived I proceeded directly to the lot to find 2 minivans and a small pickup truck parked in the lot and a very unfriendly attendant that met each of my questions with an unapologetic "This is what we have available". Ordinarily I would not be all that upset to drive a pickup, but I reserved a premium car, a car, not a minivan or a truck.  Furthermore, there were plenty of other cars not parked in the "emerald" section so the answer that was all that was available was not very believable, more like that is all I am willing to do for you.  I was really optimistic for this "emerald" experience that just did not happen, National won't be my first choice next time around regardless of the status.<//text>

We rented from National at Sacramento, California. We used the Emerald Aisle. We got a car that met our needs. I especially like the way we can just go to the aisle, pick the car we like and drive to the exit to check out. I didn't need to stop at the desk at all. When we brought the car back, we just met the agent at the exit aisle, they checked mileage and car condition and we were set to go. Got the receipt via email. Easy process. I recommend National to anyone who rents cars for business or pleasure.<//review>

A couple weeks ago I had a very difficult experience, which would have been a maybe two star experience at best, but today the employee who took the return vehicle brought his manager who was very nice and very helpful, hence the four star.

Pricing was very misleading. I was initially overcharged by >2X what I was quoted. At least I was able to get Customer Service to correct it, but only after 3 attempts.

And one more thing, the agent at the counter refused to put on his mask.< /review>

There was not an emplohe to assist us at the Emerald Aisle. When I went back to the rental car building the employee was not very attentive.  Said there was someone there. There was still no employee when i returned.  I selected a vehicle and then exited.  It was very strange that there was not the level of service i expected.  Car was OK and the price was what was quoted.

Overall OK experience - definitely not what i have experienced in the past.< /Review>

<Review>I use national regularly for business trips. I recently signed up for emerald club due to having issues with vehicles being too small. I am taller and it was great being able to pick and out a vehicle that would accommodate my height. Before traveling I checked to see if the emerald aisle was available at the Sacramento location due to everything going on with Covid which the app reflected that it was open. When I arrived that was not the case. I was told by a gentleman with dark hair and glasses that I could not choose the vehicle. I mentioned that I prefer something with more head space if possible. I was given the keys and when I walked out to the car sure enough the seat in the car I was given didn’t go back far enough. I decided to pay out an extra $94.79 that was not covered by my company to get a vehicle that was bigger. I was told at the counter that it was a Ford Explorer. It was actually a Ford Escape that sits higher but is actually smaller then the first vehicle. The dark hair gentleman with glasses angrily tossed keys of a third vehicle to another associate and said “just give him the journey”. I didn’t mean to upset anyone. Normally my experience with national is great! I fully understand that things were probably out of his hands but I really wish he could of displayed better customer service.

<Review>The person who brought me my reservation seem to be inconvenienced because our flight was early.  The luxury SUV had bugs all over the windshield and smelled of cigarette smoke.  We had already packed the vehicle and everyone was loaded, so I dealt with it.  The next morning when I walked up to the vehicle, I noticed the driver side front tire had no tread on the inside of the tire.  With over 25k miles, no wonder.  This car should not be part of the National luxury collection.  It should have been sent to Enterprise along time ago.  The young lady who checked me in was very helpful and what I am used to when being help from National employees.<//Review>< Pics>

I revised this review because they paid for my Uber and jump start fees.
Thanks .   I reserved a large suv several week’s before our trip because we planned on taking the grand kids and daughter shopping and visit local attractions.
When we arrived at the airport rental location site the vehicle was not waiting for us.   The attendant stating “ Oh let me see if I can go find one”
A few minutes later he drives up in a very dusty inside and out Nissan Armada.  It smelled more like smoke inside than the outside air did.  The door sills  were dirty .  This vehicle in my opinion had not been cleaned up after the last rental.   All was well until we visited a nearby pumpkin farm.
It was 95 degrees plus out side and when we had had as much heat as we
Could stand we headed back to the truck to head home.    When I tried to start the truck it only clicked.  We called Uber to take the family home and out of the 95 degrees.   I called National Car Roadside service to get them to come start the vehicle they said it should be about 45 minutes.   At an hour I called and they said were 10 minutes out.  At two hours I called back and they said they had to change vendors.    I called back at three hours and they said someone canceled both service calls.   I then called a local service guy and paid him to come start the  vehicle.  After paying him I was on my way.
That was 4 hours waiting on National in a field at 95 degrees.
At no time did a national personal take ownership of there vehicle & customer issues.    I have rented from National hundreds of times over the years and have never received this kind of service.<//text>

<Text>Got to Sacramento about 8pm local time. Wasn't sure if I was a "go straight to the car" member or not, so stopped by the front desk first. A friendly young lady team member welcomed me, then guided me to the pick-your-car area. Once outside, a young gentleman guided me further, letting me know which lanes of vehicles I could choose from. Picked a Malibu, loaded luggage, and was on my way. Thanks for making it easy!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>When the attendant said the keys were in the vehicle, there was only the valet key. Which meant that every time I unlocked the car, the alarm would go off until I started the engine. Very annoying. I also couldn’t unlock any of the other doors for people riding in the car until the car had started. So they had to stand outside with the alarm going off until I started the engine. I had the rental from Friday to Monday. During that time, national contacted me because they did not properly link my vehicle to my contract so they actually did not know what car I was even driving. I had to send them a picture of the barcode on the windshield. Normally, national is my preferred rental car service, I’m even an executive elite member, but this was very bad business on their part.<//review>< Name>

Was not able to keep first car when I had to renew contact. Second car had three lights on dash. I traded it in and was not able to pick another car. Manager picked it for me which I did not like. My company change the contract. Manager kept contract and price the same. Now this car has 2 lights on dash. There us no manua in carl for me to see what these light mean. At this point I don't know what to do!</review>

I travel all over the country and always use National as it’s my companies contracted partner for rentals.

Sacramento is my absolute hands down favorite location to rent from.  I often arrive in the evening and Bob or Jesse always remember me and go out of their way to accommodate me with excellent clean fully loaded vehicles to rent.  Bob and Jesse go the extra distance for me and I really appreciate them!<//Text>

<Review>First rental with this company.  Car was very fresh and, while not totally loaded, was packed with convenience and safety features.  Price was in line with what everyone else was offering and their "skip the line" process was great since there were about 6 people waiting in line to claim their vehicle.  Do yourself a favor and sign up for their Emerald Club online.  It's well worth the 15 min sitting at your computer rather than 30 min standing in line with your luggage and any other people you have with you.< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
Not sure if I posted a National Car Rental review before and please know that this isn't a review chiding the company as a whole, just those persons I encountered at Sacramento Intl Airport. I tried to explain to them that I was a Emerald Elite member. This means that I could pick anything I want with the exception of Premier vehicle selections. Instead of just saying they didn't have any of those vehicles. I had no problem selecting at every other National Car Rental I visited before, they told me that I had to pay an upcharge for vehicles I rented with no issues in the past. Either the staff didn't understand how upgrades work or they had a problem with me. I will be contacting National Car rental tomorrow and update this post with my findings.</review>

Arrived at Sacramento airport late and to National Car rental at about 11:30 or midnight.  The Executive Elite section was easy to find but had very few cars to choose from.  The best choice of vehicles smelled of marijuana strongly enough that we could smell it on our clothing after leaving the vehicle.  The experience was probably bad enough to consider a higher priced rental car company in the future.</text>

As usual National offers the best experience for renting cars. Hertz, enterprise and all the budget type companies never deliver an equal product to what National offers. The car was spotless (almost never the case with most other companies),  Emerald Aisle is by far the best approach to "rental counters" and the selection of cars available was plentiful.

Now for the bad. This was the first time I have rented a car from National that I had a few negative experiences.  First, they added all the "optional" insurances without asking me. Second, I told them I didn't want to prepay gas and the attendant checking me out said it was already selected and he couldn't change it.  These "options" cost me 80 dollars. Considering it was a one day rental it just about doubled my price. Thats not ok.

Second, is they wouldnt take my debit card. I was told policy is at an airport I have to have an outgoing flight and ticket number to use a debit card or I can only use a credit card. What? That is the most ridiculous policy I have ever heard. Usually I travel for work and use my company card. This time I was moving cross country to California and only needed a car for one day while mine was being delivered. I am not sure if this is a standard policy but its absolutely ridiculous.

Summary, National is the best rental company. They ripped me off on this rental but never have before. They wouldn't take a debit card.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I have Exec Elite status with National and reserved the emerald aisle rate to choose a vehicle. When I arrived they had sedans and three SUVs. When I approached one of the SUVs the staff member told me they were reserved for people who reserved this category. The employee stated they had other SUVs but we're saving them for people who reserved this class. This is a deviation from the normal reservation process for the status customers and wasn't disclosed ahead of time. Had I known I would have gone to Hertz because I needed an SUV or at least a truck. The sedans they had that were roomy enough for gear and luggage both stunk of cigarettes. Half way up to our destination my friend's son was experiencing an asthma attack because of the concentration of cigeratte smell in the car. He was nauseous and sick the remainder of the way, which I felt bad for.
To add to this horrible experience when we got back the check in process made me feel like an employee not a valued customer. The woman who checked us in approached the car making demands. "Turn the car on, roll the windows down and leave the keys in the cup holder." I walked out to help unload our gear and didn't roll all the windows down so the employee told me in a very loud manner "I said roll the windows down."
While I understand Covid has changed the way we do things it shouldn't mean give up on customer service. I won't be renting from National again, the service has gone downhill and that was the only reason I rented from them because price wise they can certainly be beat!< /Text>

As a National Emerald Club member, I intentionally went through them so that I could get a RAV-4 for a weekly rental while our car was in the shop.  I specifically indicated in the reservation that I wanted the RAV-4, and I even confirmed this by phone with the local renting location two days in advance of pick-up that we wanted a RAV4.  Naturally, when I went to pick up the car, not only were there no RAV-4's to be found, but the staff told me I would get "a better SUV, a Mitsubishi."  As I choked that down, and was then provided a Jeep that was a poor rental, I decided that I'd likely not use National again.<//Text>

If at all possible, I try to rent from National only. The experience is so much better than the others. Get off the plane, walk or shuttle to the National lot, find a ride (hopefully that I fit in) on the Emerald Aisle and drive off.

I'm a big guy (6'5" 265 lbs.) and greatly appreciate the ability to choose my own vehicle. I fit decently in the Altima and have also had luck at some airports finding a full size Dodge truck, which happens to be my personal vehicle.

Thank you National for the very reasonable rental rates, good vehicle selection and great customer service. You make the others look like rookies.

Go Like A Pro!

If I could give it 0 stars a I would do so. For the amount of money they charged me and they only had 4 cars on the lot to chose from is embarrassing. I asked an agent if there was anything else and they told me they had nothing else unless I wanted to wait. I feel like I was ripped off for what I had to drive</review>

<review>Pretty expensive.  If you are an exec club member, I think they assume you are just renting from them and not checking prices.  Not as good of a value as you might expect.  Easy to use up front and easy to drop off.  However, if you have any problems with the car along the way you better have an extra 1-3 days in your schedule to get these guys to honor their replacement and roadside guarantees or just suck it up and find a new rental company.  Their customer service folks call back, but definitely NOT convenient if you have a tight schedule and/or they can't service or replace the car at all.  AND if you get broken into and have to deal with their damage recovery group, god help you.  They are as heavy handed and rude as any low budget medical bill collections agent you may have been forced to deal with in your life and they don't care how many car you have rented or if you ever rent from them again.  AND  if you over pay them on a damage claim because they bill you and your insurance simultaneously, they have no urgency whatsoever to get you your money back.  Still fighting with them on that one now for 30 days.....<//review>< Resp>

<Text>I appreciate National Car Rental's Sacramento Airport location.  They are easy to access, and I can be on the road in less that 5 mins from arriving at the car rental hub.  Beyond that, they have a great selection of vehicles for a 6'6" person to drive comfortably.  I will definitely use them again on my next trip.< /Text>< Pics>

I arrived to pick up my car 2 hours earlier than I had scheduled. National already had a car reserved for me. I reserved for a premium SUV and that is exactly what I received! The gas was full, it was clean, and the service was excellent! I prepaid for my vehicle online, there were no other hidden fees charged to my card. I highly recommend National and will definitely use them again!<//Review>

The people at Sacramento airport were great. When I got out to the cars, there was Nissan Frontier. It's one of my favorite rides. This one had a tiny screen in the dashboard, no iPhone interface like many cars do now, and it was not clean inside. Other than that, it drove well and I had a good trip.</Review>

Very easy to reserve a car, pickup and drop off. Everything is online, no waiting in lines to pickup a car and multiple cars to choose from. Drop off is easy also, nothing to sign, receipt is emailed to you instantly. The more you rent, the better the cars.</Review>

<text>I had an amazing experience renting through National Car Rental. It was so quick to get service. It took under 10-15 mins to get my rental car. I loved that I was able to choose my vehicle from the available vehicles that fell into the car type/price point that I was renting at! I own a jeep so I really liked that I was able to select a Jeep model! The selection process was completely new to me and different from the other competitors. I would definitely rent with them again and suggest them to a friend!

Please note, this next statement applies to all the rental car companies out of the Sacramento Airport (Hertz, Avis, National, etc). The only con was the wait for the buses to get back to the airport on a busy day in the afternoon/evening its the same bus for all customers of all the rental car companies. There was a very long line for the bus that took you to the terminal that had majority of the airlines (forget if it was A or B - I flew Alaska). I ended up just ordering a Lyft to get to the airport because I could expense it through my company. However, it is important to note and plan for or else I could have missed my flight since I did not plan for that.< /text>< Date>

<Text>I really liked the quick pick up isle for the car and also the quick drop off too. But what I didn't like was although I could choose which car to take I notice they were all the same models. So in reality there is no real choice of cars, a little bit disappointed.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

<Text>Recently rented an AWD vehicle for Lake Tahoe.    When we were headed back to the airport, it snowed and the vehicle wouldn't engage the AWD.  I hit the button and the light wouldn't stay on.  I had to buy chains and have someone put them on and take them off so that we could get over the pass and make it to out flight on time.  The chains were $130 and $50 to put on and remove, so $180 total.  I left the chains in the vehicle.  Hopefully someone can use them.  I told the agent when I returned the vehicle.  He said "Oh..that's too bad."  I sure would like a refund or some free rental days to off set the $180 that I spent.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1583337885313, 'text': 'Karla Ekdahl, we would like to look into this further.

Excellent customer service at Sacramento.  I had reservations at competitor, who denied me a rental because my drivers license name didn't match credit card (recent divorce). On a whim I went to National counter and was treated with respect to find solution,  I had email copy of divorce decree,  was able to get car and proceed with vacation.  All because they were able to take the time to find a solution and help me and my boys!!< /text>

I'm a loyal National Emerald member and have Executive status. I love being able to just pick a car and leave. The last rental I had we had an issue the way it was booked; for some reason when I booked on the app it came up as a business booking and not a personal booking causing my free day coupons to not work. After about 15 min it was resolved but it seemed like it took forever being that it was midnight.<//Review>

Ever since Hurricane Harvey, I've been a big fan of National car rental.  I like the pick any car in the lane feature, so I can get a car that meets my needs when I arrive at the Airport.   We picked up a rental car at Austin to drive back to Houston after Hurricane Harvey hit in the summer of 2017.  Since the Airport was closed, I went to the desk with the bill I received, and the quickly took the extra days off my rental since they were not open and I couldn't return the car.  I was very happy with their decision to not try and charge me for the extra days I was forced to have my rental car.  They earned a customer for life that day.< /text>

Car styles were not represented well between website and location. Reserved “choose your car from the row” $70/day rate on the web. When I arrived, I was offered a Hyundai, but said I could upgrade. A Hyundai is NEVER worth $70/day. Only option was to upgrade to chose my car from the row. Whatever. Did that, and only 3 car options on the row: Hyundai, Nissan, and one Jeep. Chose the Jeep only to be told it was not available AFTER we got in and drove to the checkout point. We had to drive it back, get out, and choose a Nissan. It was ok; the car worked fine and the staff were very nice. The hassle of it all will make me hesitate before renting from National again.</Review>

Rentals are effortless.  Walk straight to the vehicles, make a selection and drive away.  National has made it so it couldn't be easier.  Love renting from National.</Review>

My experience would be a 5 star except that I was surprised to find that my rental had a 30 cents a mile charge because I was returning it to a different airport. I have always had unlimited miles so was surprised by this, and the large extra cost compared to other car rentals where the fee for returning to a different airport is $25.<//text>

The rental situation here is worse than it needs to be. For an off-site facility, it takes a good 30-45 min to get a car when you’re about 3/4 of a mile away.

This location has an absolutely horrendous selection. This past instance is a prime example of how poorly managed this National Car Rental location is run. 5 people, besides myself, were lost in the lot because there were only pickups and minivans. That’s just shameful. I had to wait nearly 30 minutes just for a simple sedan.

National has continued to go downhill. Avoid at all costs, and find a rental agency who actually cares about your business.</Review></record>

<Review>After waiting 20 minutes without any movement in the line which for the company from which I had reserved a car AND observing the National counter with countless people coming & going, I bolted to the National counter. Should have done it sooner! I was out of there in 3 minutes, maybe less.  Efficient, pleasant....excellent check out.  I found the same efficiency when returning the rental. National is not the cheapest but they get you on your way quickly. National is now my go to for car rentals.</Review>< Resp>

<review>Very easy to get in and out.  Not many different types of vehicles available, but plenty of cars to pick up when i arrived.  Granted it was the holidays, so I was excited that they had so many cars.  I was able to get a car with only 8000 miles on it.  It was very convenient to be able to pick up in the Sacramento Airport and drop off at the Fresno Airport.  I spent maybe 15-20 minutes at the rental facility total between both ends.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><user_name>Jake Lackey</user_name><gmapID>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566</gmapID>< Time>

I like National.  I would add a half star if I could.  The downside is the selection is not always very good. Depending on the city and the weekend it can be ZERO cars, even with a reservation and Emerald Club Executive Elite® status.  Believe me. More than once I have been in a city (Lubbock comes to mind) where their were no cars at all and I was told "sorry".  That's it, sorry?  No car, no reimbursement for a cab I should not have needed. No offer for a free rental for the inconvenience. NOTHING!

Part of that has to do with the fact that a lot of folks are top tier status, particularly because National specifically targets the business crowd. I can tell you a lot of us rent a lot!  Getting the 25 paid rentals or 85 paid rental days in a calendar year is easy for most regular travelers. There in lies the rub.  It's to easy.

My colleagues and I regularly hit between 175 and 225 days a year.  Yet we are no different than those who hit the minimum. It would seem that if you have customers who are setting a standard that high there would be a tier that rewarded that kind of loyalty. Call it a Concierge Tier or some other fancy name. I remember renting from Hertz back in the day when I was Hertz Gold, the O.J days.  They had my desired car in a stall with my name on a board telling me where to find my ride.  That is the kind of service a true road warrior deserves. I want a Pacifica or 300C waiting for me. Not finding the only options left on the lot are half a dozen Camaro's with a giant neon sign above them saying "pull me over". (Happened more than once in Seattle).

So if you are looking for budget rentals there are a lot of cheaper options out there.  But if you travel a lot and  like that you can (almost always) have a selection of most any size car you want waiting for you, with a first come first served caveat, then this is the place for you.</text>

I always used to recommend National. This last rental really changed my opinion. I rented a Nissan Altima from the Sacramento Airport National Car Rental Hub.  The tires seemed to be a little worn, but not too bad at a glance. Wasn’t many others to choose from anyway...

I made it to my hotel room to rest for the evening. I left the car parked in the hotels garage. In the morning I came out to find the rear drivers side tire flat. I called National Road Side Assistance and they explained what could happen. AAA would put a spare on and I could either exchange the car for another at the airport or get the tire replaced at a tire shop near by. The operator went on to explain the the shop may have to call to get the approval for the work, but it would not be an issue.

Upon arrival to the Firestone Tire Shop, I explained the situation. They went through their standard operating procedures, got all the info, and called for approval. When answered by the operator at the airport they were denied. The operator explained that even though Firestone is contracted to work on their vehicles they would not cover the cost. I was Told I had To Pay For The Replacement. Which actually meant all 4 tires because of the wear on them. They said I could keep the receipt and be reimbursed when I return the car.

I refused to pay. After being on hold for 5-10 mins on several occasions, I was then told I could exchange it at a near by Enterprise. What? I rented the car from YOU, National.

The Firestone shop then ran the parts and labor through Enterprise and after about 45mins it was approved!

3.5 hrs later. After missing work. Being lied to. Endangered on a spare and bald tires. I found out National rented the car from Enterprise and refused me basic contract services.

I used the car the rest of the week and returned it to National at the end of the week. Thanks for the awful experience and lost wages.

Shout out to the Firestone shop on IKEA dr in West Sacramento, Ca! Thanks for working with me and getting me a safe ride.< /Text>

<Review>We got in late on Christmas Eve and the emerald aisle was closed.  But on top of that it was raining and all they had was Camaro’s and pickups... so either not enough room or wet luggage. But Ali took care of us, he found us an SUV with enough room for our luggage and family. He even went out into the lot and pulled it around for us so we wouldn’t get wet.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>All the staff at this location were really friendly and professional. They answered all the questions that I had. Checking in and out was extremely quick and convenient (even adding a second driver was really easy). One of my favorite things about National is that the estimate that you see when you reserve the car is what you end up paying in the end. There are no hidden fees that surprise you in your final receipt. I really appreciate that.< /Text>< UserId.>

<review>Always easy with National!  Emerald Club executive status means no stopping anywhere.  Pick out any car you like from the rows of cars and drive off.  They check your dl at the gate and that's it.  When you return, they scan your car back in and give you a receipt right there. No counters or lines anywhere.  Usually a good selection of cats, too.< /review>< Time>

Great first-car-rental experience! Super easy to reserve online, just walked up to a car and drove away, cars are super new and clean, and there are no hidden fees! My one downside of the experience is that I had a late arrival to the airport and really had to scram to get to the National car rental location before they closed at midnight. I wish they would stay open a little bit longer after the last arrivals of the night.< /Review>

I have never rented with national before but I became an emerald member before showing up to get my car.  This made the process so easy, I didn’t have to wait in line, I just walked outside and chose my car. Unfortunately, I they didn’t have exactly what I was looking for in my aisle, so they let me upgrade free of charge.
I like national.<//review>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>I rent a lot of cars. Previously I had been solely renting with a competitor. That competitor created the opportunity for me to test another car rental company. I posted on LinkedIn the request of who my network of 24k+ uses. 80% that responded said ‘National’.

So I setup the app, became an emerald member and booked (2) rentals as a test.

I found the rates to be 10-20% more with the same features (Pre-purchased fuel refueling program).

Rental 1: I returned the car with just under 1/4 tank missing (about 3 gallons). Fuel refueling charge was over $80. Did not match the agreed rate per gallon.

2) rental 2: I had to change my travel and would return the car to a new airport. With my previous rental company this is a $200 charge plus the rental fee as a comparison.

I called national because the app did not allow me to do so easily. The customer service person was great but told me the one day extension and return was going to be $483. The rep could not explain the charges or break them down.

He suggested I return the car and re-rent a new car on a one way rental. I checked and the rental would have been $283.00

I rented with AVIS for $203 *including the fuel refueling service.

Rental 2:  original was from airport in St Louis MO pick up and return. I ended up picking up in StLouis, returned to St Louis and rented from AVIS from St Louis to Indianapolis.

The manager at National St Louis Airport location listened, but offered nothing different than customer service agent. I wanted to discuss with a manager just in case I had a new person and they didn’t understand procedure.

In the scope of life not the end of the world. In Buisness disappointing: more cost, policy is not logical and no corrective action offered when presented the details.

Positive: the manager allowed an employee at National to use the car I had rented to shuttle me directly to AVIS! :)

Other positive: National employees were awesome to deal with. Super easy to navigate the process. Cars were clean and all worked great.<//Review><rate>2< /rate>< time>

Great service at Sacramento Airport. We had the choice of 3 pickup trucks. We chose a Ford F-150. It was a joy to drive and very comfortable. We would highly recommend National Car Rental again!!< /Text>

I really like the concept of bypassing the counter and selecting my own car along the aisle.  My only complaint though is that the car selection between the Emerald aisle versus the Executive is almost no difference.  What should be a nicer car in Executive could easily be what you find in the Emerald aisle.  I rent from National about every other week so I have racked up quite a few points, I haven't used the free car rentals yet, but from what I understand you can only use 3 days at a time, this is also disappointing as well.  National needs to pick up their game with better cars and allow better use of free rentals before I see them worthy of a 5 star rating.<//text>

<Review>I travel every week to Sacramento from Los Angeles for work and i tried different car rentals and found that National Car rental is my best option. I love the choice to select my own car from the lot. The selection of the cars are great mostly new models and low mileage. The staffs are friendly and helpful. National Car loyalty program is the best in business when they say free care rental it is free with no tax and fees too. The other loyalty programs like Hertz, Avis, Enterprise are not even close. Over all I have a very good experience with National for the past 2 1/2 years.</Review>< rate>

I booked a compact car and had an upgrade coupon code.  When I returned the car, my receipt showed Intermediate car price charged.  I asked the attendant to change the type of car charged and he was unable to fix the receipt.  He took my email and I never heard back from him.  When I went to "My Trips" the receipt had been changed. I wish I was contacted to know the new receipt was there.  I just expected a little more customer service being an Executive Elite member.< /Review>

The Sacramento airport National Car Rental took good care of me on a recent business trip.  As I arrived the lot was lacking models for me to select from.  One of the associates asked if I was looking for anything special, I told him what I was interested in and wham, bam, just like that the model I requested was there for me, all gassed up, washed, and ready to go.<//Review>

<name>Evan Jones<//name><time>1567020983508<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Customer service came through like champs -- two emails to me and a free day's rental, plus the original free day.  I changed my rating from two to five stars.  I will leave the original post in case anyone is waiting for a plane, or missed a flight and has lots of time.  Again, thanks and kudos to National for the super service.
Original post by me:   Usually, I consider my experience with National Car Rental to be 5-star rating, from the people on the lots to the people on the phones.  But this last one was a disaster, I write not to chide them but to warn other customers:  I rented a Dodge mini-van at the Sacramento airport.  It had automatic door locks which drive me nuts.  When I dropped my family off at the departure gate, I was going to return the rental and join them inside.  As I closed the tailgate, the car locked with the keys inside, along with my suitcase and cell phone.  Whether I hit a wrong button or it locked on its own, I don’t know (I personally witnessed a friend’s Dodge lock him out as we were standing beside it).  That’s when things went from bad to worse. My son called National, and was told nothing could be done but call AAA and it would take up to 90 minutes for someone to get out.  Foolishly and against the clerk’s advice, we asked to talk to the National desk at the airport, certain they had a way to open the car.  Instead, I was connected to the most inept person I have encountered by phone.  It took him a half an hour to enter a few basic facts before AAA was summoned.  It turned out that coincidentally a service person was at the airport already, but by the time he found me, unlocked the car, I returned it, and took the shuttle back, I missed my flight. The next day I called customer service to make sure that I was not charged the $58 AAA fee – supposedly, someone, perhaps the bumbling clerk, had already reversed the charges, though I am holding my breath on that one.  The customer service person graciously gave me one-day free rental.  I have never, never, left the keys to any car on the dash unless I first roll down a window.  This was the first and last time.  The bumbling clerk told me this happens “frequently.”  So why in the world doesn’t National disable automatic locks or otherwise take steps to prevent locking keys in the car, as is becoming routine with new cars?  I still prefer National Car Rental above all others, but after this dismal experience I have a lot of “notes to self” about rental cars and their keys.</review>< pics>

<review>Was traveling about two weeks ago and ended up having an awful experience with Dollar Rental. I walked a couple booth over and was greeted by a welcoming smile. Behind the counter was Cheryl, the most friendly person I'd come in contact with all day. She went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. Because of Cheryl and National Car rental I was able to see my father after 10 years! Thank you for an amazing experience.<//review>< pictures>

Such an easy car rental.  Just showed up and picked out a car.  Got into the car and drove to the gate.  Showed my license and drove away.  Drop off was just as easy.  Drove in and stopped the car.  Gathered my things, said hello to the return rep & told him the car was full of gas, and walked away.  The most time consuming thing was waiting for the airport shuttle.< /Text>

I like National in general, but not this specific location.

Options were limited. Seems like they keep the better cars parked separately, and as an Executive Elite member, I couldn't choose anything nice or what I wanted.

Another complaint, their cars don't get washed every time. I drove a dirty one both of the times I rented at Sac. Also, the car I had, was last serviced at 7k miles(had a sticker), and it was already over 20k, so I pointed that out to them later, that the car hasn't had an oil change for over 13k, whick is too much even for synthetic, which they should change every 7k about for optimal engine performance.< /text>

<Review>Everything was seamless. The selection was all Nissan and Chevy. Our Altima performed well, but they are low riding and underpowered—especially for the California freeways.
The rental car bus is not Nationals fault but it is remarkably irritating. The airport needs to redesign. The lines are staggering and trying to get to the end of the line is uncommonly hard.<//Review>< Pics>

I am not a fan of National.  First of all they give you 2 keys all the time and that is hard to carry around and to put in your pocket.  Second their cars are dirty and have a lot of miles on them.  Third their staff is untrained and unprofessional.  Fourth they don't use CLEAR like Hertz for checkout and the process takes forever.  Fifth the app they have to try and speed up the checkout takes forever and saves no time.  Sixth they don't have cars with toll tags in them like Hertz.  It takes an additional 5 minutes at checkout to get one . Lastly they charge more than Hertz for the toll tag.  Avoid National.< /Review>

<text>National Car rentals check in team saved my flight home.  After hitting unexpected traffic delays I arrived shortly before boarding time. At the Sacramento air port you must take a bus to the tram to reach your gate. The attended (who I wish I had got his name) pulled an employee to jump in the rental care and drive me to the gate. saving all the transportation stops. It was the last fight to my final destination that day.  flight date 7-31-19 at 5:30PM to SNA.

Rental car itself was fine, getting out of the rental center took WAY TOO LONG.  The person in the booth left the booth three times while working on the customer two cars ahead.  Who knows why.  No, I am sorry for the 20 minute wait, no nothing.  If the person is not capable of doing their job, they should not be there, someone one should be out there to help move things along if the incompetents working in the booth can't do their job.</Text>

National customer for 20 years with many great rentals that were worth the extra cost over discount operations. But recent rentals have been so bad I am rethinking the relationship.  Cars not available, requested services not provided, poor inventory, customer service issues with either computer problems or poorly trained reps unable to answer basic questions, extra charges, high mileage vehicles.<//text>

<Time>1513178391739< /Time><rate>4<//rate><Text>Usually I have a smooth experience renting from National. Sacramento Airport wasn't my best experience.  1st car I loaded into was missing key fob so I got error message when I pushed start button. Unloaded and loaded into 2nd car and the stench of cigarettes was too much. Unloaded and lifted hatchback on 3rd car to find the rear deck cover off it's track and blocking the cargo compartment. The staging lot was nearly empty. I approached a representative and was quickly directed to a satisfactory car.  Of course, by then, the bulk of customers on my shuttle bus had gotten their cars and clogged the exit booth lines. The booth attendant had already been informed of my delay, relaying to me there would be no fuel charges for my inconvenience. Much appreciated. I've rented 20+ cars over 4 years with this being my toughest experience. The staff on duty served the large surge of customers well and within minutes had tagged the bad cars, with fresh cars being driven in to re-fill the lot. I will continue to use National.<//Text>< pictures>

First experience renting from National. I was in Sacramento for business and usually go through another company. I was fortunate to work with Safa. The entire process was pleasant thanks to his outstanding service and kind disposition. He educated me on the many benefits of National and because of Safa, I have switched my loyalty program to National. I’ve already convinced my husband and colleagues who also travel often to do the same. The return process was also smooth with outstanding representatives to greet you. Thank you, Safa!< /Review>

Coming from someone who already has 75 rental days this year, National is by far the best place to rent a car. There is always a variety of cars to choose and the ability to pick your own is a definite plus. Check out is fast, typically less than 10 minutes and you're on your way!  Staff is friendly and accommodating. I will only rent from National.< /Text>

When we were checking out our car, we couldn’t get Bluetooth to work. We asked the girl at the checkout booth about it. She told me the car didn’t have Bluetooth,but she would be happy to get me one that did. We parked the car, she left here booth and found us a similar care with Bluetooth. We switched and checked out, I asked the girls name, she told me April. April went above and beyond my expectations. Later I discovered I had left my IPad in the first car. I contacted National. They found my IPad for me, sent it to my home, and it was waiting on my porch when I arrived home. Also at no charge. National is the best car rental company in the business, great policies and great employees.< /review>

Love the Emerald Aisle where you can pick your car. I dinged one star because the selection wasn't as good as it should be, but it did have a Chevy Silverado 4WD truck that was perfect for driving to South Lake Tahoe. Great prices. National is the only rental service I use. I highly recommend using them.<//Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><date>1556663478485</date><review>I love being able to walk directly out to the lot to select my vehicle (and NOT having to stand in line at the counter).  The folks at National are always super helpful, too.  What I do NOT like is that the selection of rental cars seems to be focusing almost exclusively on trucks and SUVs.  At my most recent visit to the Sacramento Airport facility, I was luck to find one sedan (and I really mean that there were absolutely no other vehicles available except for trucks and SUVs).  I consider this an issue, since I do not want to drive a truck or an SUV.  Hope National can increase their inventory of sedans.< /review>< gmap_id>

Smooth and easy. Every time I rent with National (normally 2-5 times a year) it's a great experience. The Emerald Aisle is so easy and user-friendly. You literally just walk straight off the plane and into the car of your choice from the National lot. That's it! No lines, no checking in, no one trying to up-sell you on insurance, no hassle at all. The staff are always amazingly courteous too.</Text>

Emerald club experience was unique and I enjoyed the convenience of picking any car parked in the lane exclusively for Emerald club members. You walk in directly to the lane, pick any car (of course there won't be Mercedes or Porsche in that lane), drive to check out booth and boom, you are good to go. There was no pressure to buy liability coverage to my surprise. Overall very good first experience with National. I highly recommend.</text><Time>1461692630899< /Time>< pics>

This last visit I took a car from the line and at the gate they told me I couldn't have it. It was a fully loaded SUV so I figure the lot porter just messed up. No biggy. They gave me a free tank of gas at check out for the trouble of circling the lot and getting a new car. Excellent customer service.<//review>< pics>

I recently rented a car in Sacramento and was dropping it in San Francisco and did not know I was going to be crossing a toll and had no cash. I wish National had of offered me the E-Z Pass because not only do I have to pay the toll, but I also have to pay a $25.00 Toll Violation. National should have known about the Tolls in and around San Francisco.< /text>

<Name>Orlando Leal</Name><text>I have never had a problem with any car rental since May of 2017.  I rent on a weekly basis.  The crew at Sacramento have been excellent.  I was running late to the airport and they actually drove me from the rental to the airport - that was unexpected.  One day it was raining and to my surprise, I was driven to the airport.  It was all unexpected and I was truly surprised and very appreciative of the service.  Without that over the top service, I would have missed my plane and not gotten home on time.

On a recent trip to Sacramento we arrived to find nothing suitable on the Executive aisle. The gal attending the lots learned of our need for a large vehicle and produced a minivan from the back of the lot that perfectly fit the bill, all the while being very professional about it. Good show!<//Review>

I reserved a "Sporty" car for a trip my wife and I were taking up into the Sierra Nevada mountains.  It said "Dodge Challenger or equivalent" when I placed the reservation.  When we arrived and checked in at the Emerald Aisle they told us they would need to find a car for us, which took about 15-20 minutes.  When they finally brought the car up it was a Dodge Challenger, but it was the absolute lowest trim package available (V6 engine, cloth interior, etc.).  I guess perhaps it is my fault, as they gave me "what I reserved," but it seems a bit strange to reserve a "sporty" car that is slower, less well equipped, and just generally worse than a standard Nissan Altima...

I was very disappointed with National in this regard.  Next time I would tell them to take their "Challenger" back where they got it and I would select a normal car from the Emerald Aisle that would have been 10x better.</text>

My only beef with the whole process is the Sacramento airport shuttle to the rental car facility.

The process at National is fantastic and very easy.  Great for executive emerald club members.  The one consistent frustration I have, however trite it sounds, is almost every single time the windows are incredibly dirty.  Car just got washed or whatever and you can't at least dry the windows?  I can't see out of the side view mirrors because of hard water spots?  Come on.  How hard is this?  As good as the process is, this is one of those things that just drives you nuts every single time.  I'm in 8-9 rental locations in various cities, and almost always the same... just please wash the windows!< /Review>

We understood the shuttle starts at 5am, so everyone who had an early flight was lined up. There were 3 buses to serve the car center. Wish they added more buses.

My national experience at the Sacramento airport was seamless. I arrived at the rental car terminal and walked directly to the car area they did not have exactly what I reserved but they were able to find something comparable in seconds. My return was equally as easy allowing me to hop on the shuttle in a matter of minutes.</review>

<Text>One of the best airport rental car locations I have found in many years.  Emerald Executive renters greeted by name at check in; good selection of cars for a small lot.  Returns are fast and efficient with plenty of well-trained and pleasant staff on hand.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>My experience this trip with National, once again reminded me why they are my go to rental car company. Their customer service is always excellent starting with car pick-up until drop off. They always seem to have a good selection of cars. On those few occasions when they don't have exactly what I need, they make every effort to find it or accommodate me with something better. The important part is that I always leave happy. Even when my needs change and I need to trade the vehicle in for something different mid rental. They do so with a smile. This trip I needed to extend a rental  and it was a breeze through the National app. Overall great experience..... again. Thank you National.<//review>< date>

I travel to Sacramento often and nearly always use National Car Rental, so I was surprised when I checked out that my travel group had made reservations with a different rental company.  The check-out person said 'no problem' and proceeded to set me up in the chosen vehicle.  The only disappointment was the fact that they did not use the corporate account that I 'always' use and the rental rate was substantially higher.  They are friendly and efficient however next time I will not assume they will 'take care' of me if I had been booked in a different rental agency.< /Review>

Love, love, love National Car Rental! Emerald Club makes it so easy and it's a real pleasure to drive the latest makes and models! I was a little worried about a timely shuttle to SMF airport when I dropped my car back off at 4am for a dawn flight. No worries though, I waited not even 5 minutes and the shuttle appeared! Awesome exit gate agent too.< /review>

We had a brand new car (well, just over 2K miles on it) and it drove wonderfully. It didn't have a single dent and still had that new car smell.  It was a 2017 Chevy Impala.  Nice car. The service couldn't have been any better at National either. We were in and out within minutes with no hassles at all. We'll be using National next time as well.</text>

National is by my experience the best rental car company out there, and I have used them all over the years.
The staff is always great to help with any needs and being an Emerald member is very rewarding when you walk past the counter and see the other travelers waiting.
My favorite is the morning the car is due back, I receive an email that links directly with my GPS taking me directly back to their lot.
With all the highs and lows of travel, National is the one constant non hassle of each trip.

<Review>I never write online reviews for anything but I was compelled to after having such a good experience at this place. It was my first time renting a car, I'm 24 and my credit isn't the best. I just flew from NC to CA and my destination was 4 hours north of Sacremento..so getting a rental car was a life necessity that day. I had a reservation at another rental place but because of my bad credit they couldn't rent to me (understandable) So they sent me to National and things couldn't have gone smoother. Because of my age I was thinking I was going to have to cut my arm off to pay for a tiny compact car that I wouldn't feel comfortable driving. Instead, I ended up with a Dodge Challenger and ended up saving over $300. Eugene(?) I think was the name of the guy who helped me. He was great and really friendly.  Ended up taking the car back,  paid the price I was quoted and that was it. No surprise additional charges or anything like that. I will definitely use them anytime I need a rental.

Thanks again!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Outside staff is friendly and helpful.  (did not interact with inside staff).

If you are Emerald Club, pick up is as easy as walking to get your car and driving out.  However, be quick as they may have only one exit open and you'll be stuck in a long line of cars to get out if you take too long choosing a car.< /Text><date>1499440607581</date></record></dataset><record>

Moe could not have been more helpful at the National @ SMF. I was planning a trip for 6 and I had just missed out on an Infiniti QX80 which was in the Executive Isle and was going to settle for a Nissan Armada (equally as roomy but lacking in luxury).
Moe checked the inventory and 10 minutes later pulled up in an Inifinti QX80. When the rest of my road-trip party saw the vehicle, I am pretty sure they all created Emerald Club memberships then and there.<//review>

<Review>I was absolutely thrilled with the ease of picking up and dropping off my car.  I chose a beautiful little Sonata from the "Emerald Aisle," and was on my way very quickly, bypassing the crowded customer counter inside.  This was my first time using National's loyalty program, and I will definitely be back.</Review>< Response>

Staff was helpful and the car itself was decent. It was filthy, however. Normally I wouldn't care much, but the side mirrors were all but impossible to see out of and the windshield was covered in bugs. On the inside, someone had stuck a suction cup to the windshield that left a big mark behind right in the center of the view. I'd have taken a different, cleaner car, but the selection was poor. A quick 5-minute clean would have made all the difference.<//Text>

After arriving at SMF and at National Executive Isle, there were no cars. Had to wait about 5 minutes. No choice except to take the next car brought up.  Not my usual experience with National and a bit disappointed. The car was OK with no problems.
Check in was a little before 5:00 AM. Just left the car and received receipt via email.</Review>

<Review>Using Emerald Aisle, great fast arrival, pick car and drive away.  I left my family to get the bags while I picked up the rental.  I pulled back up to the terminal just as they were walking out with the luggage.  As a car enthusiast, I wish they had more "interesting" cars to pick from, but it's just a rental.  Unlike my last two rentals from Budget, this was easy, the cars were in better shape, and they didn't run out of cars despite my reservation.  So National definitely wins.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

It was my first time renting through National, and I'm happy I signed up for the emerald club beforehand.  I was sent outside to choose the car I wanted (in the class I reserved) but was upgraded because they were all out of my class of car.  Renting and returning the car is quick and easy.  I hope the other National locations are as great as Sacramento.  If they are, they have my business for life.<//review>

Emerald Aisle was almost empty because I arrived at a busy hour. National employees allowed me to select a smaller car than was on my reservation because I felt uncomfortable with the only vehicles available. Appreciated the helpful service and willingness to accommodate my concerns. Would recommend for anyone visiting for business or pleasure!<//Review>

The Shuttle Experience taints the whole experience.

I brought this up with a representative once I reached the rental car center (after 25 minutes), and he said, "that's contracted out, I can report it," which means there's no way to improve the experience.

A half an hour to go a mile is silly, and the driver's unwillingness to load his tiny bus until the other was loaded even though there were a hundred passengers waiting, was dumb. Of course, piling luggage in the bus that would become projectiles in any accident is dumb too.  Whomever designed this experience should be re-assigned.

For a 20% fee from the various Sacramento taxing authorities, passengers deserve better, and National should push this point earnestly.</review>

I arrived a day early to pick up the truck and had to wait about 20 min for it to be refurbished for my use.  I was comped a tank of gas for my trouble and drove off on my trip.  As I use the emerald club process more and more I find it to be a very convenient and hassle free process and enjoy the personal service I receive each time.

They seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I am supposed to be able to walk onto the lot, pick a car, drive up to the both and just quickly confirm my preferences and show my license...Yet this took probably 20 min. On the return I got a chip in the window, to fill out one small piece of paper for my insurance to take care of it took over 45 minutes. I am switching to Hertz or Avis after this experience.< /Text>

The staff at Sacramento was typical of all the other National Car Rental locations.  They were extremely friendly and helpful. As an Emerald Aisle customer, the number of available cars was limited, but I was immediately told to select from any car on the lot.  The way I am always treated is the reason why I have been a satisfied National customer for 20 years.</Text>

<review>I always rent with National. As an Ermerald Club member, I find cars are always available, courteous staff and easy pickup and return. I recently had an unexpected flat tire in Albuquerque and the National staff made it extremely easy to return the car with the flat tire and drive off with a new car in very short order.

Due to flight cancellations and delays, I was EXTRA late finally arriving at the Emerald Aisle for my car.    The pleasant man still manning the booth told me I was his last customer, and although he was supposed to have been off at midnight, he stayed until I arrived at 1am to be sure I got my car.  After the day of travel I had, it was refreshing to be greeted so pleasantly and to have a car ready and waiting to hit the road for the next leg of my journey!< /review>

My favorite rental car agency, but my last trip they charged me quite a bit more then they were supposed to and even with disputes and fraudulent activity, still had to pay them around 1200, that really surprised me, because I know Hertz is worse, but I hope they are not going this route.

<review>Nothing easier than getting off the rental car shuttle bus, passing all the other people standing in line at the other companies' service desks, and picking out a car.  Then the exit was also easy, with National pretty much having the paperwork all ready according to my stored preferences.   Not real crazy about the car I chose, but that is just me.  I would advise leaving plenty of time upon return to  the airport, because the line to get on the shuttle to the terminal was quite long, and the trip takes a little time.  But that is not National's fault.<//review></record></dataset><record>

National has great customer service. There was only one car left in the Emerald Aisle when i arrived at SMF, and the agent was happy to let me choose a different car on the lot. Cars are in great shape and still have the new car smell!<//Review>

I will start off saying my flight was delayed about 1 hour. However, I don't think that that was a big impact on my experience.

When I arrived, there were no vehicles available. There were about 10-15 people waiting to get a vehicle. As vehicles were brought out, the person at the front of the line was offered that one, and if declined, it was offered to the next. So, there was a very limited choice. It took me about 30 mins before I got an SUV or minivan (after turning down a small car that would not have held my luggage and an extra person or two).

When checking out, I asked about the line, and was told it had been that way since mid morning (I got there about 2:00pm), thus, I don't think it was my flight delay that caused this problem.

This seems to be a common problem across multiple National Car rentals at airports.</Review>

<username>Toni Morris</username><review>I have been an Emerald Club member for a few years now and generally always have a positive experience with my car rentals.  My last three rental experiences however have been disappointing in that I had to wait for a car (there were only SUVs/Vans in the lot) and when additional cars were brought to the lot, there were VERY limited car options.
I have always enjoyed the benefit of just walking to the lot, choosing a car and getting on my way.  These recent experiences, while not devastating, were not the same great experiences I have had previously.< /review>< user>

Not good this time but will give them another chance. The car that I rented from them was said to be returned in another state on a different day. This charged my bank account over $1000.00 dollars. I found this out on the last day of my vacation with my wife and we had to cut off our vacation early to get to the National rent a car center because they could not fix the situation over the phone. So we went in and the people were very helpful and offered me $100.00 credit. This was helpful but now they owed me over $1000.00 and i was three days before I got that money back into my account. Everything was on pause because of this and it was not good.<//review>

<Text>Always a great experience as a member of the Emerald Club to bypass the lines and go directly to the aisle to pick a car.  I have rented a car at the Sacramento Airport a few times and the luxury of the cars available varies from time to time, but there is always at least one that catches my eye and serves me well.  Good to pay for a smaller car and get the next size or two larger.  Returned the car at 5:15 am Sunday morning and was confused about what I needed to do since there was no signage or attendant present.  Had to leave the car in the line of returned cars to make my flight. Worked out though as I received a receipt via email later that morning.  Good to learn I wasn't charged for something that might have happened to the car after I left it like a dented fender.  Overall a great experience.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I had joined the emerald club, which was the best decision I had made.  It was as easy as walking to a car and driving it out.  The only complaint I had was they had charged my credit card for 2 gallons of fuel, even though I had filled up at the airport.  After calling the customer service they reversed the charges.  Was not happy about that.  Other than that it was a good experience.<//Text>

Great service. No wait. I was sweating coming back to the airport that I may miss my flight due to traffic, but it tool me less than a min to get to the shuttle, as there was no delay in receiving the car.
Minor detailed cleaning needed. I do have to say the car was not super clean inside. Felt normal but not new.<//review>

< review>
Went to go do paperwork for my reservation and was very unhappy. I have only rented a car once before so I am unfamiliar with the process. The counter guy asked if I wanted basic or full collision insurance. My company carries full rental car insurance for us but since I didn't know the rules of the state I was in I ask if those are the only two choices as I already have insurance. He states yes either basic or full. I say basic and he swipes my card and asks me to sign the and initial the rental agreement. I read it over and it says I accept optional basic insurance and there was a second line for optional roadside assistance for a charge I also wasn't asked about on the bill. I state to him he said there was no option for insurance and it says optional here. He rudely takes it off has me sign the new paperwork and sends me on my way. Good job lying to try to make an extra sale.</review>

<review>Had an issue with the Tahoe SUV from San Francisco. Stopped at National Sacramento and all they had were a few midsize cars on the lot. One of the guys cleaning the cars came up and said he'd go find an SUV for us. I saw him hustle to the returned car lot. Then 20 minutes later I see a silver Tahoe pull out, getting vacuumed and ran through the car wash.  He then parks it where we are waiting. Wish I had tipped the guy.  Talk about outstanding service. Nadine and her crew were great too with handling the paperwork. National Car Sacramento rocks!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1482428438260, 'text': 'Nino, thanks for the kudos.

No real issues, quick and easy pickup and dropoff.  The biggest complaint would be the incredibly large set of two key fobs that you're forced to have with rentals in general it seems.  The SMF airport rental car shuttle isn't always the most timely for taking you to the rental center but that's not National's fault.</Review>

I didn't notice until I hit the road so I thought it was going to be a problem when I returned the car because I had no proof, but the national staff trusted me and just asked what they needed to do to make it right for me, so they credited me the fuel service charge.

National Rental did not seem to want my business when I landed in Sacramento. They were not helpful in telling me what car to take. I was told to go to the kiosk but no one was available to help there. This was my first time renting and I was shrugged off when I asked for help. The woman pointed me to a row of cars and then went back to help someone else that arrived after me. I found there were no empty cars in the row so I went back and again she waived me off. When I finally found an empty car, I wasn't sure how to start it since I had never used a keyless car. It took a decent amount of time to find someone to help. He was more help than the lady. However I waited a long time to get help and feel that National could have been much better.< /Review>

I reserved a mid size SUV for a leisure drive through North CA.  They had a brand new full size SUV on the lot for the same price.  I am a emerald isle participant.  Very nice rental without any hassle.  Will definately use again!

Trouble checking in with an Internal Credit Card from my company.  Agent told me to talk to the manager. Manager stated, "We have updated our system and the internal billing card was not excepted!" I showed  him the number of rentals I had this year and I said the only place I had problems was at the San Antonio and Sacramento sites.

Manager, " I need a personal credit card, and I will also need to see you airline reservations." I ask what does the airline reservations have to do with my National reservations? He stated that in case I would not return without checking out they would know when I would leave Sacramento!! Never had I ever been ask for flight reservations.  The office cleared all misunderstandings especially since the manger was WRONG!

I arrived at the hotel after midnight and had to prepare for my business meeting next day at 8:00 am.

I would not give ONE star, however the system you are using does not allow for feedback without a star.<//text>

Help from the only man on staff is much appreciated with the billing dilemma we were faced with after landing there! Sam (Samir), you are an asset to your company who will keep customers coming back! Assistance from general manager on a different billing issue on our rental van was another pleasant experience.</review>

I usually end up with Budget.  I don't know why but this time our travel contractor selected National.  I never saw any paper or signed anything.  I walked out to the lot, picked a car and drove to the exit where my credit card and drivers license were checked and out the gate I went.
Coming back was just as easy.  I drove up the the return area.  Grabbed my luggage, accepted my receipt, then walked to the shuttle pick-up area for a short ride to the gates.
I will suggest to the travel contractor that they select National for me every time and get it set up on my preferences.
Thank You National<//Text>

This was my first time using National and it was definitely the most pain-free experience in renting a car that I have ever had. I bypassed the counter lines and wait and walked straight to my car on the Emerald Club row drove it to the kiosk and they already new my name and I was on my way in less then 3 minutes total. Pretty awesome system!<//Text>

There is always a good selection of cars in great shape.  Returns are even faster.  National prices are higher than some other companies, but not that much.

<text>We had a good experience picking up our car, and were pleased with the vehicle during the time we had it. I've generally had a good experience with National, but upon returning the vehicle, we had a less than positive experience. I'm an Emerald Club member and the rental was in my name, but my other driver (not an EC member) returned the car while we checked baggage, as we were on a tighter timeline. Another EC member was allowed to drive the rental up to the terminal and unload, with a National employee driving it back. But because he himself wasn't an EC member (although the reservation was mine), he wasn't allowed to do so. It was frustrating, but overall thankfully not typical of my experience with National.<//text>< Date>

The car was in great condition and worked well. However, there was no way to get the bill from going to my corporate card when this was a personal rental.  I called and was told this was not possible. It was quite disappointing to not be able to switch cards as needed.  It automatically went to the card on file and there was no one on site to be able to change this for me when I picked it up. I was just directed to a lot to pick my car.</Text>

The staff was very friendly.  I've been an Enterprise customer for over 20 years and when my business partner asked me to consider the Emerald Aisle, I decided to try for it.  The selection of cars was a bit disappointing (they were all the same model); however, it was nice to skip the counter and hop in a car.  The return was also very smooth.< /review>

Always try to go with National but lately in Denver and my last trip to Sacramento there was a lack of vehicles to select from, not sure why!  Slightly disappointed, hopefully this will turn around.</review>

<text>Pretty disappointed with National Car Rental in Sacramento.  Rented cars there a half dozen times in the last few months.  Then a couple weeks ago I reserved a car for under $45 total.  When I returned the car, the clerk said his receipt machine wasn't working, so they emailed it to me.  30 minutes later I saw that I was charged $129 for a car I used for 3 hours and put 40 miles on.  I called National's customer service line, and the lady told me she would contact the Sacramento branch and see what they could do about it, and would call me back.  She never called me.  I called again and spoke with a man, who told me he was setting up a call-back and that someone would call me from National in the next three business days.  It never happened.  I've been various levels of membership, including Executive Elite.  National has LOST MY BUSINESS as of right now, and I'll make sure everyone I know is aware of their poor customer care as well.<//text><user>115022970999176087541< /user>< rate>

My flight got rerouted due to a snow snow and I didn't get into Sacramento until 1:30 AM. They normally close at midnight but the night manager stayed and made sure we could pick up our car. I will always use National from now on after this great experience.<//Text>

National always has a car that I want available.  Customer service is great.  Never a surprise on the bill.  I’ve had bad experiences with other rental car companies. Quote a rate on the phone and when I turned in the car, much higher!
National is competively priced.  Always a good experience.<//review>

<text>Such a disappointing experience. I made an online reservation using my corporate rate. When I went to pick-up the car, I had to stop at the counter to add my traveling partner as an additional driver (something that was no additional charge under my corporate contract). However, the guy behind the counter told me the rate, which was more than double what it should have been. I explained that rate is not correct and he just stared at me and said that is what his computer is telling him, so that's the rate. I pulled up my confirmation e-mail, told him what my corporate code was and he did nothing to be accommodating. The whole time he just sat behind the desk and offered no help whatsoever. After about 10 minutes of me trying to come up with a solution, I finally decided to just pay the outrageous rate because I needed the car and I was getting really frustrated. So disappointing because I've used National many times in the past- all of those times I'd go right to the Emerald Aisle with no problems. However, the one time I need a National rep's help, it goes badly. Just be warned if you're looking for help from a National agent, you will not get it. It really did put a sour taste in my mouth the whole trip because I felt I was taken advantage of- he knew I needed the car, so there wasn't anything I could do without his help. I ended up paying more than double what I should have paid and it made me sick to my stomach.  I've been in customer service before and that is NOT how you treat your guests.</text>< Pictures>

<date>1530817532189</date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>The National rental place was quite far away from the main terminals. We had to take a bus to reach there. But the bus/shuttle service is pretty good and a shuttle arrives every fifteen minutes or so. Anyway, we reached the rental car place and it's a big parking lot and a small building with all the car rental company’s in the same location. We had reservation with National so we went there. Safa was very nice and courteous. He recommended the right stuff and gave us the right advice. We asked for a GPS and he gave us option to have the physical GPS device or he could put us in a 2018 Chevy suburban for lil bit more with Built-in navigation and more cargo space and we went with that one. There is a gas station at the entrance of the airport area, but he offered us to prepay the tank if we using the FULL tank which was one of the best decisions I made since we were already late for our flight back and no need to stop by gasstation and waste time. the return process was Swift and pain free.

Pick-up a breeze!, Drop-off a breeze!  [SMF] Sacramento needs to do something to improve their shuttle service to and from Terminal to Rental area. Their service was the worst I've experienced ever with long lines waiting for shuttle ????  How does that happen?</review>

I use exclusively for travel.  The emerald club is the best thing out there.

I have rented over 100 cars from National and have only not had a good rental once

I do wish they carried some more american cars in the executive rows.

<text>The rental experience was very hassle free. Walk out get in a car and leave. Unfortunately I returned the car early in the morning before you were open and was not able to get a receipt. I requested a receipt be e-mail ed and left my information on the return card I filled out with the mileage and fuel info and left it in your drop box. I am in need of 2 receipts. Both in sacranento. One for the week of May 9 and the week of May 16.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>102464517318360255772< /userid>< username>

As an Executive Elite member I frequently use National for business trips; however, after my experience at the SMF airport location, I most likely will be taking my business elsewhere. They would not accept my corporate travel card because the name didn't EXACTLY match the name on my drivers license. So I used my debit card and it took approximately 15 minutes to verify my travel itinerary as part of their debit card policy. I normally fill up before I return the vehicle; however the rental attendant told me that their gas is the lowest price around and that if I bought a full tank up front, I would save me money if I brought the vehicle in at a half tank or below. As I left I started to crunch the numbers (tank capacity, $/gallon around town, $/tank from National) and realized I would have had to bring the vehicle in with 1 gallon of gas remaining to break even on their so called money saver deal. Normally I don't get rooked but on this occasion I did. I thought being Executive Elite meant something. Just goes to show there is no point in being loyal to any 1 rental company. Lesson learned.<//text>

<Review>Overall it was fine.  When I went to the lot only to find just two cars were available - a Monster Suburban or a Cadillac sedan, not the Chevy Malibu I reserved.  I was told to take either one.  I'll never turn down a Caddy at a Chevy price but it was strange not to have more cars available on a Wednesday afternoon.  One thing rental car companies need to consider - cars like that Caddy have far too complicated control systems for a short-term rental.  I was still working out how to work out the climate, radio, entertainment system after 4 days behind the wheel.  It puts drivers in unsafe situation as we struggle with steep learning curve.<//Review>< date>

< Review>
I always rent from National thru Emerald Aisle.  But the Sacramento Airport supply for Emerald is weak at best.  Their cars are more like mid size or basic full size.  I have rented there twice in 2 months and the cars they have in the "Aisle" have not been up to Emerald Aisle standards.  If National wants us to pay premium prices for Full Size to get to Aisle, they need to upgrade the cars at SMF.  I rent all the time from National and this is not normal.</Review>

As an Emerald Club member, Vehicle pick up couldn't be easier. I just pick one from the Emerald Club aisle and drive away.  Returns are equally convienient.< /Text>

Took a while to find the vehicle I wanted. When I did find the Chevy Equinox, I was more than happy with the performance of the vehicle.</Review>

National makes renting a car very easy. I book using the app and am an Emerald Club member and so I get to chose the vehicle I want to drive.<//review>

My experience with National rental car at Sacramento Int'l was top notch. The car was very good, the customer service was excellent, and the convenience as a club member is fantastic!  Thanks National!</review>

My husband booked a car for us originally. My 5 year old son and I flew to Sacramento. When I went to pick up the rental I was denied because my name was on the rental but my husbands name was on the credit card. When I tried to tell them I’m an authorized user I was still denied. Then I explained that I had a debit card in my name and I was denied. So there I am in Sacramento, with a 5 year old, at 8 pm and they won’t let me get a vehicle.  Also, no one tried to really help me resolve the situation. Finally, after about 20 minutes and getting frustrated , a manager walks out and proceeds to tell me the only way for me to get a vehicle is for my husband to go online and go to Priceline to prepay a car. So my husband did, using MY DEBIT CARD that National just said they couldn’t accept!!!!! So when they pull up the Priceline reservation and ask me for the card I’m going to pay with , they then accepted the same darn card they just refused to accept. Sheesh. So finally after about 30 minutes I get the rental. The car was great, and the return was super easy but the actual picking up SUCKED.<//text>

<Review>I love national car rental. they are my first and only choice when it comes to renting a car. best part is that i get to pick any car.
but their customer service really need to upgrade their knowledge about national. National recently partnered with Plenti for rewards program. but no one had any clue at this location what plenti card is. what to do with card. hence two star less.

I like national car and i will continue to rent from them. it will be nice if their employees knew about national product better.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Easy in and out.  If they are short on cars just wait few minutes and one will appear freshly washed.  Only detractor is sometimes the wait for the rent car bus at the airport is too long, but nothing like PHX.<//text>

Was overcharged by about double for my last rental. Wasn't given a receipt as I left the lot.   Realized the error about an hour after leaving and called for assistance.  Customer service seemed to have no authority.  Called back and after escalating the matter finally got to the bottom of the problem.  For some inexplicable reason, it takes DAYS to get a refund, even though their initial charge is instantaneous.  National seems to have little interest in my experience there, although I am an Emerald Club member and rent from them frequently.  They should have credited the entire rental, considering the problem that the error caused.  It was disappointing to me that my continued loyalty to their brand meant nothing and that their error was something I was just "stuck" with.</Text>

Great experience, walked out to a car line - picked out a nice clean car and drove away.  Drop off was early morning left the car in line and received an email later that showed complete sign in.  hassle free!< /text>

Great experience- straight to the Emerald Isle - Got a brand new Chrysler 300 - very happy - only negative is the cars aren't under any sort of cover and i picked the one time to arive that Sacramento has a rain storm - can't blame the weather on National :)< /Text>

<Review>The staff was welcoming, helpful, and kind. The cars available were limited, but I got what I needed. I appreciate having XM radio in the vehicles as well. My only request is to make National reservations in Sacramento airport an option in our corporate travel system, Egencia. Today, AVIS and Hertz are the two options available. I go to the National counter when I get there. So far, I've been lucky and they've had cars available for me to take. National is an approved vendor with our company, so I can make reservations through our system for other National car rental locations.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I was running late for my flight and National's rep drove me straight to the terminal -- much faster than the shuttle! Great service, good car selection, too (lots of Nissans with quick bluetooth connecting)! I rent from National only!< /Review>

<Text>The vehicle choices and customer service at the Sacramento Airport has exceeded my expectations on the 9 rentals at 115 days already this year. I give (5) stars for this location. However I just returned from Salt Lake City and they do things a lot differently there. You do not get to select your vehicle regardless of your tier status and they only provide Chevrolet model vehicles. I used my free days I've acquired this year to rent a car while I was in SLC to secure housing for my relocation to the area. I was extremely disappointed in the with the car I was provided with. Their customer service at the rental counter in the parking garage where one would need to wait in line to be issued a car was sub par at best. For this National Rental Car location I give (1) star and recommend an alternate.<//Text>< pics>

<review>All my luggage was in my rental car when I got locked out of it while refueling.   It was 5 AM in the morning.  An enterprise representative, Talhar,  was at the gas station and offered to help me.  When it looked like there wouldn't be time before my flight to get the car unlocked, he drove me to the airport and offered to help however he could.  He reported matters to his supervisor and she referred it to National Lost and Found.  Allan of the Lost and Found took it from there and helped me both with getting the report in and in completing the claim form when I had trouble with the website.  All of them were stellar in their graciousness and eagerness to help.  Colene Lee< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x809b2b0f343b8021:0xd344193333018566<//Gmap_id>< date>

There were 3 cars to choose from and the guy insisted the one we picked was a full size car.  So we spent almost 2 weeks in a miserable little car!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Picked up car at Sacramento Municipal Airport (SMF).  Slight scratches detected on rear bumper below trunk edge.  Reported this to National attendant.  He said it was from other drivers loading luggage into trunk.  I reported it to woman at the check out window and she came out of booth and photographed it and noted it on my rental agreement so I would not be charged for damage later. My only dissatisfaction is that the door mounted  rear view mirrors on both left and right doors had water spots from washing the car and were not wiped off.  This has happened many times with National and other rental agencies.  I stopped at gas station and got the mirrors cleaned off.< /Text>< gmapID>

I reserved my 12 day suv rental a month in advanced paid in full with no refunds. Once arrived, I printed the ticket and went on to the parking where my suv was going to be picked up. Out in the parking I finally found an attendant advttendentnd he informed me that they are all out. What??? I prepaid for it 30 days in advanced with no refund. ..meaning their is no way back for me...and should be for them but they didn't contact their selves in it. They found an older 2012 SUV that was on the lot and I was on my way. That suv was dirty outside and inside. Later discovered that the chargers where burned out and we could not charge our phones. One of the tires was low on air and SUV had lots of vibration going down the hwy. After 4 days and 1,600 miles, we arranged for a replacement in Sacramento which was a became a terrible experience. Read my review on Sacramento location. I will never rent from Alamo again. Enterprise will do.</Text>

<Review>1st time renting from National - I made errors with my booking - needed an SUV; booked a midsize car - lot staff at Sacramento airport sorted things out quickly and cheerfully - got me on my way in short time - and with a great SUV at a fair price.

<rate>2</rate><Review>Very poorly designed facility when there is any kind of rush hour to turn cars back in.  Waited for 30 minutes to get in the lot around 5:15 am in the morning.  Inexcusable!  Don't know if this is entirely National's fault, but when you are trying to make an early morning flight, it doesn't really matter.  This needs to be corrected.   Next time I'll just take Uber.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

National's customer service and personnel attitudes are always very good.  Everyone you interact with is always willing to help and do so with dedication.  I am noticing, however, that the car selection, particularly at the Executive section of the Emeral Aisle, is getting very mediocre.  I have noticed this very markedly in DEN, SMF, and to a lesser extent in ORD.  What's going on National?<//review>

I rented a car in one location and returned it to another.  I have a written confirmation quote for the price, but when I returned it they charged me $34 a day more than my written quote.  That is not what really bothers me, what bothers me is that I filed a written complaint to their corporate almost 2 weeks ago, called 2 times for an update, and they have not returned my call or given me any updates.  It seems like there are management problems at both a branch level and at the corporate level.<//Review>

We wanted a van however we took a small Chevy SUV that became available.  Not real Happy.  SLS<//Text>< Pics>

My experience with this rental was as follows:
Selection of automobiles in the Emerald Aisle was somewhat limited.
The inside of the windshield was so filthy that it was difficult to see at night.
A warning light indicated the vehicle was low on windshield washer solution.</text>

This location has a lot of room for improvement.  When I picked this vehicle up early Sunday morning the attendant was sleeping in a vehicle in the return line.  The car had water spots all over the mirrors and glass.< /Text>

I have used many of the car rental companies over the past few years, National is always my first choice.  Their business model is friendly to the business customer, and the time I have saved with National is well into days.  Only one suggestion, I guess all companies use the same carwash,  because all rental cars have annoying spots on the mirrors and windshield, I suggest a wiping them down before the water dries.</text>

<text>Had a reservation...joined the emerald club. ...picked up my car... swiped my credit card...drove ....returned the car....took the bus back to the terminal. All  in cost me $29 for a Nissan Murano  for 2 days. Steal of a deal.

The only issue which was a non-issue was when I pulled away I noticed the tank was half full. I  took a picture with my phone and when I checked in let the agent know about the fuel situation. She asked if I had a photo or called them, showed the photo she said OK and noted it on the file.</text>< userid>
