Terrible! I order a mobile order at a wrong store and they refused “to make the moment right” and make my order on the spot. They charged me an additional time and told me to take it up with corporate Starbucks. They gave me an attitude even after telling them I was a barista for 3 years.<//Review>

Starbucks is Starbucks. But the people who worked there did an extra special job on my girlfriend's mocha latte. (And the seating was confortable.) So they get 5 stars.</Text>

<review>The employees are great , coffee is good , stay and enjoy the bums and homelessness that surrounds you. Bum sleeping off to your right and another talking to himself right across the way , seems they love the bathrooms located right behind the soda machine. But it also seems they dont really know how to use the bathrooms these homeless covet because there is always fecal matter on display either on the floor or walls , if you love relaxing with the bums go to this most lovely establishment</review><user_name>John Cinco</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Went to Here to get my caffeine fix. While I was in line. There was a fly inside the food display case. I ordered my coffee and I told cashier about the fly. She looked and when I saw it on top of the bagels I pointed it out to her then an asian girl said “I got it , don’t worry about it.” But she was still getting food from the vase and serving it to customers. Now that’s gross, I guess I will have to go a little farther to go to another Starbucks.<//Review></record>

They're slow, unwelcoming, and the worst thing is that they don't know how to prepare coffee. Since when does a macchiato (which Starbucks calls "espresso macchiato") have milk in it? No, it's only milk foam, morons. Didn't Starbucks train you idiots at all? Numerous times I've asked the workers here to do it properly, no milk. And almost every time, I get a cappuccino (i.e., with milk). When I complain, they make me a new drink, no apologies for the extra time I have to wait (another 5 minutes typically, which for a fast food chain is quite a lot). The reason I keep coming back here is that this store is the only place in the area where one can get some quick food and a caffeine fix. They really do suck.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808f9e5ed9a0fe31:0xe0cb1f0597d5f4df< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Always a reliable place. I am not in love with their coffe but the ability to always produce a good experience is something to highlight.  I do enjoy your nite coffee and kudos for being creative with your menu.  One thing, check the temparature of your water.  You may find that dropping it a few degrees takes the bitterness away from your cup of coffee and your teas are much nicer for the tea leaf is not burned in the brewing process.<//Review><Time>1535931051103< /Time><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x808f9e5ed9a0fe31:0xe0cb1f0597d5f4df</gmap_id>< username>

<Review>I love this starbucks. It's friendly and familiar.  The employees get to know the people. It's less likely to attract random people than other stores. Parking is usually easy because Safeway is nextdoor.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

One of the employees was smiling at everyone but when it was my turn to order the employee stopped smiling. She also didnt give me the same enthusiasm when she took my order. My caramel frap didnt have enough whipped cream.< /text>

<Review>Today I purchased a cranberry orange scone.  It was in a prepackaged plastic labeled "Not labeled for retail sale". It was dated 23 Sept/2017, that is 5 WEEKS before I purchased it. I called Starbucks customer service I was told it was customary to sell something 5 weeks old. After 15 minutes I asked to speak to the manager, I was disconnected.</Review>< pictures>

I get my drink today, he forgot the limes so he walks over to me and asks me to open my lid, I do so and he adds the limes. I look at the limes and the insides were brown. Disgusting.<//text>< pics>

Finally opened today 3/18/21. Looks very clean and they have placed sanitation areas. Really hope they're able to stay open. Doesn't look busy yet so I was able to get a workout in. Let's see how this goes. Keep it clean and safe everyone😷🤪< /review>

I got a 3 day pass to try it out and it was a great experience.  I been a member at 24 but my membership is about to end and I wanted to try somewhere else. I’m ready to purchase the all access membership at planet fitness because the gym works for me, they have a lot of room to do your own workout which is something that I like doing. Customer service is great. Young adults working there but they’re very nice and mature which is something I liked. I wish they had foam rollers and box jumps in the gym, but no complaint I can just bring my own foam roller and use something else to jump. I loved their concept of  No judgment gym and I really feel the great there. You see a lot of people different shapes and nobody judging or acting weird  for having a great fitness body. This gym makes me feel good about myself where I can be who I am showing off my extra pounds with no pressure from other people working out  having a goal in mind to be stronger with a better shape and healthier. They also offer the message beds and chairs and something else for your skin. They have plenty of lockers, showers, and free candy 🍬 haha . Thanks planet fitness!< /Review>

Make sure to ask for *Emily* she was really knowledgeable about all of the prices, programs , offers etc. She was quick and did not waste my time. Really good offers right now but I'm not sure I'd it's always this cheap or if it's because they just opened.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1582850397363, 'text': 'Check, check and check!

It's a brand new facility near the house so I'm real ecstatic. It's clean but a little crowded in the afternoons likely because it's new. If you live in the area, check it out.<//Text>

<review>The place is nice and new, however, it is kinda small still bigger than fitness 19 which is the closest competing gym.
The parking lot is also small and fills up fairly quickly.</review><rate>3< /rate><user_name>Christina Arteaga</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<review>It’s a good gym, the only think that it a bit annoying Is that they play Fox News and it’s just on the TVs.       Politics should stay out of the gym.     No fox or cnn.  Play sports or movies.  Just saying< /review></record>

We needed gas late at night after 11pm and this seemed to be the only place available for miles.  The actual store was closed but we could pump gas with a credit card payment.  The other gas station, Chevron? was  closed.< /Text>

It's a great market to a town I grew up in for as long as I can remember. Good prices, friendly people, and couldn't be more convenient if you live in Lakehead, California.< /Review>

I ordered yesterday and picked-up/purchased a couple tires from Just Tires on Perris Blvd in Perris today. Pedro, who helped me, provided the best customer service I've had in a great while. Even their customers in the lobby knew Pedro and made it more comfortable in being there.. Their techs were awesome as well. Their facility is clean and relaxing. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and everyone needing tire service as my experience with this facility and personnel was awesome...Keep up the great work....Thank you< /Text>

So disappointed in this locations service. Came in September 2020 and got my ELECTRONIC BRAKES done here. I go back in October to complain that the noise was getting worse on my brakes. The older man  not only was rude after I asked what was taking him 3hrs to do my brakes but he said nothing was wrong with them that they are new it’s supposed to do that noise! I go back in JANUARY and there’s a complete new crew, they stated my brakes are worn out and meed replaced ASAP. Long story short no JUST TIRES locations do ELECTRONIC BRAKES! So I had gotten scammed. After contacting GOOD YEAR, all they did was give me more work on top of my frustration. They would refund me my money until I went and got a new receipt and the receipt charged at just tires (which I did provide) after a month of not receiving a refund I gave KIMBERLY a call from corporate and she said she can’t issue me a refund until I take my old brakes to just tires to scrap! Why do I need to do all that? She claimed because I was charged for the brakes, which was dumb! They never had the equipment to removed electronic brakes!!!!! There for I never had NOTHING done from them, but I HAD to take them MY worn out brakes ( which I kept after I got them done at Honda dealership after I told them how I got scammed) this location is sexist! They thought I wouldn’t notice because I’m a female!  Don’t waste your time coming here! Even corporate is disgusting with customer service, we’ve serviced here for 24 years! NO MORE! Honda took care of me and gave me a discount!</text>

I came to this location to get tires for my rv and they got me six ordered and in store within a day . It is old and a hard size to find and put on since the left side wheels are left handed. They were rusted on for a long time. I left happy and with brand new tires. Makes sure to ask about the good year credit card.</review>

Not the best but the best that is available in the area. Not saying names but another place not far from here.... Don't go there, not friendly or helpful. Tires these days just cost way to much.< /review>

I came to vet my mother's tires rotated, the wait was extremely long, but it's because they were understaffed, they know what they are doing just don't have man hours. So what can you do? But manager gave me discount</Text>

<Review>They say they open At 8:00am The workers arrived at 8 and it took them 15-20 minutes to even ask me if I needed help. No sense of urgency what so ever. I was in a work truck and trailer so it’s clear I’m in a hurry. Didn’t wanna fix my tire and said I needed a new one and way over charged me for a trailer tire that I refused to pay for and had to drive to another shop.. Over $240 for one tire & I buy a lot of tires for my trailers and never paid over $140.00<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1595277912960, 'text': 'Hello,Rigoberto. We are sorry to hear that you feel that way.

I came to just tires and they were able to provide free front end inspection that helped me figure out my next step for my repairs. I would highly recommend this place .

<review>I have gone twice and was refused service.
First time I went, was 2 hours before closing for an oil change. They said that they were closing in 20 minutes.
Second time I went was to do a break flush and they said the machine was broken while doing the service I was looking to get done on my own car.
I feel as if the manager Jessie is not doing his job. I was looking for good business with you guys, but I guess not. Next stop, Les Schwab</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Been coming here for years. Love how they treat people and both my vehicles. They are honest and don't try to add or sell you on saying this has to be done like most mechanics. They know what they are doing and can leave there knowing that they did the job right.< /Text>< userid>

If I can give them 0 stars I would. This tire shop did my alignment for my Chevy suburban. 3 weeks later my tires are wearing out from the inside. I took the truck back to the shop and they said they went near responsible for the tires because they left aligned. Horrible place. Spend a little more and go somewhere else.< /Text>

Customer service, prompt service, and reliability dropped dramatically after Eric left. The manager himself said the technician they have working is slow and can't get a brake job done is 5 hours. After 5 years they've lost my business.< /Review>

I wouldn't recommend this place. The customer services was bad, they wanted to charge 119 dollars for a used tire and labor, and they couldnt refer me to anyone else who could provide service when they told me they didn't have my tire in-stock. It took me 10 seconds to get on my phone and find Jimbos tires right down the street and they did the exact same job for 35 dollars and it took 5 minutes. Don't go to just tires, go to Jimbos instead.</review>

I bought  4 new Goodyear tires that  failed  within a few  weeks of each other  by disintegrating  from the  rims. I got no help from just tires in resolving the issue. I may have to go the legal route to get  this matter resolved. I will NEVER  do any more business with them again.< /review>

If you are looking for an honest business this is not the place for that. I went in for an oil change on a car with only 68000 miles. I'm aware that my young age and gender puts me at a disadvantage, but that is why I always educate myself on every topic at hand, especially when I have to pay for it. I'm still looking online for GM's new requirement for the most expensive oil to be put in my car (still can't find it).< /review>

<Text>So I had a situation that I have never dealt with before where 2 of my tires completely blew out on me and took all the tread off the tires. I called Goodyear and they were quick to handle it and explain what I had to do and scheduled an appointment for me with this location and told me to see a guy by the name of Mitch. So I drove down there and saw Mitch and it went from great with Goodyear to horrible with Mitch. I would have much rather he just accuse me of doing something to the tires that mind everyone that reads this they were factory tires on my brand new truck that only I drive. He said he wanted me to bring a contract of sale so he could call Goodyear and give them some information on it that he wouldn’t share exactly what that was and then told me the tires on the truck were 6 years old but again wouldn’t explain what was going on or how the situation would unfold other then he needed a contract to call Goodyear. Well hey Mitch don’t worry my man Goodyear stepped up and I got my tires fixed without your rude service and really bad demeanor. Thank you Goodyear for doing what you did and you may want to check into this store because let’s not forget it’s just tires like the name says right? Don’t make it personal because of your career path you chose after the military. I will never go to this location and anyone I know will never go to this location due to the horrible service I received like I’m supposed to know all the ins and outs of the rubber business, I aim much higher then that.<//Text>< Pictures>

Bad service . I dropped my car off at 2:15 and they told me they had 2 cars in front of me , went back at 5:00 to check if it was done , they said your car is up next . I’m not a mechanic but I know it doesn’t take that long to do an oil change< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad attention from your employees, little kindness, they need customer service training.

The apple that I got from Panera Bread.
The customer service was poor every time I went to that location.The gentleman at the register is always unhappy and I feel bad about him but the customers deserve a better and quality service and better food. I will never come back again at this location.< /review>

<text>Very expensive for half sandwich and half-salad with large drink.  (Over eighteen bucs.). Sandwich was delicious, salad was good.  Used app for first time and curbside pickup, service was fast, app is good.  This location has a drive-thru.  Parking good.  Access in and out good.  Good to quality but not the greatest value.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

My friend ordered online two drinks and I showed up there and waited almost a half an hour until someone finally asked me what I needed and I guess my order was never sent to the back so no one was making my drinks. Then someone handed me a cup to fill up my own ice tea. This is why we ordered online because I was working and I had to pick it up quickly.<//text>< pictures>

During a visit I witnessed just how busy a cafe it has become. The drive thru line was humming, and the walk-in cafe bustling. My visit was longer than usual as I was aiting for my dining partner to arrive. I witnessed attentive and welcoming service as well manager instructing an employee on her expectation for maintaining a sparkling clean dining room. All done professionally and effectively. I suspect that this location will thrive as it continues to serve an enthusiastic public.</review>

<review>Apparently someone likes deleting negative reviews from this page. This occurred on 9/20. We ordered $10 Steak Sandwiches from this Panera Bread. There was barely any meat on the sandwiches and it was mostly just bread. Waste of money when I could go to another sandwich shop for better value. Save your money and go elsewhere.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80d95831be2d0693:0x744ed9abd5475da1< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Love the El Cajon / Fletcher Parkway branch that has drive thru!! Fantastic if you have kids you can't unload to grab s coffee, or are running behind for work but need a coffee ora prepared  lunch . It's not a Fast food so sometimes the drive thru is a little slower. They don't fry up a bunch of food hoping to sell it fast, rather they take an order then prepare it. Don't get frustrated... It's fresher<//Text><pics>None< /pics><user_id>105702700847527939939</user_id><rating>4<//rating>< gmapID>

I know a lot of people love this place but I have yet to receive good food here. The supposed steak sandwich I purchase, had 3 thinly sliced hard pieces of meat inside a decent-sized roll. I had to open it make sure it had meat inside, since I could only taste the bread and had no taste of meat. I didn't want to complain because my friend I went with had invited me and was happily visiting with me. On top of that, they got her order wrong when she went to tell them they told her to get in back in line. She had to ask why, when they didn't fulfill the order properly. They finally brought her food.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>New and clean location. Kiosks for ordering allows you to order quickly or take your time by not holding up a line. Food is consistent with other Paneras. My daughter and I split a "Pick 2" and got just the right amount of food without being overstuffed. She got a creamy chicken soup in a bread bowl and I got a chipotle chicken panini. Both were very good.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>This location has a problem getting orders correct. Apparently it is too difficult to read an order and fill a bag properly here. Save your money on this overpriced school lunch. The woman who handled my order was not wearing proper face covering as well and was not a uniformed employee.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

First of all, super expensive. It was $17 for half of a tuna sandwich, a cup of soup, and chai tea. Second, when I pulled out the bread for my soup, there was a huge hole in it! The “bread” was only crust and no bread.</Text>

Just went thru the Fletcher Pkwy drive thru for a cup of coffe snd a cinnamon role. First bad thing I have had here in over 3 years. The roll was dry and tough and about as good as a day old  dunkin donut. The coffe was not even tap water warm. Come on guys. You can do better than that. Total waste of time and money. 2 stars cause the server was polite.< /review>

<Text>They accidentally messed up my order today. However when I called they where extremely professional, not only did they replace my order, but they personally delivered it to my home when I explained my son was not feeling well and I just got home,  and  to top it all off they threw in 2 delicious chocolate chip cookies. I understand how it is working in the food industry, accidents happen, orders get mixed up etc. However what does matter is the way these situations are resolved and for that I give this team 5 stars. Whoever was working today between noon and 130pm deserves a paid day off for their excellent customer service. Even the person who took my order at the drive through, who was extra happy and gave off nothing but positive vibes .Thank you for being so understanding, and taking the time to give subperve customer service.<//Text>< pictures>

Marquel has made this location my favorite Panera Bread to dine in. Today was my second time served by him and I was compelled to share my appreciation for his politeness, kindness, and the spectacular service he provides to EVERY customer.

Marquel, if you’re reading this, you reminded me of the quote, “The way you do one thing is how you do everything.” You’re going to do great things and Panera Bread is luck to have you.</Text>

For my Birthday today  my friend took me to Panera, which is one of my favorites. After lunch I realized that I had wrapped up a dental appliance in a napkin and threw it away. Going back the Asst. Manager, my friend and myself put on the gloves and went through the trash.  Well, we found it, and the Asst. Manager was so very helpful, as well as the staff. Can't wait to go back. Thank you</review>

Don't bother placing an order online if you expect it to be there when you go to pick it up. Apparently, the order ticket doesn't show up at the store until the ready time. So if they only make bread in the morning and they've given all the bread that you've already ordered away by the time you set for pickup you're SOL. Most pathetic way I've ever seen a company like this run.<//review>

I LOVE eating at Panera and so so all the time!  I usually switch what I eat from visit to visit as I like so many of their menu items!  My favorite item is their Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich on Tomato Basil Bread.  You have the options of customizing your meal and I really love that feature!  Their Hazelnut Coffee is TO DIE FOR!!!  The only thing I don't like about Panera is that they can be a bit pricey for what you get.  Overall, I LOVE Panera and will continue to eat there!</Text>

I had an AMAZING time here thanks to the amazing quality of service that Mary provided. She was super friendly and respectful of everyone in the restaurant and would consistently provide excellent service to everyone. Give this woman a raise!!!!</review>

No coffee.   At 9 in the morning and with very few customers.  Inexcusable.
Unless you count flavored or decaffeinated as coffee which most people don't.   Management needs to run a tighter ship or loose business to the obvious competition down the street (just over on Broadway near Ballantyne).   You MUST have coffee ready to go in the morning when the customer wants it.< /Review>

The most courteous Panera Bread I've ever been too. Truly great customer service. The Baker who happened to be the cashier today March 20th at 1:45pm was amazing. She handled my order with care. I will always come here. The food was fresh, the bread AMAZING I have no idea what these low star ratings are about, however, they must be doing something different.<//Text>

The quality is very spotty. I have gotten great customer service and I have also gotten service from hell. The food is what it is considering it's a chain. Consistency will make a world of difference for this place.< /Review>

I've avoided the drive thru mainly because something is always wrong or missing. I usually just park and go in. Today was a long hot day, figured I'd try the drive -thru again. MISTAKE. After asking me three times which soup I wanted (chciken/rice--soup of the day) I got home and had some sort of corn and potato soup? Can't eat corn,  so I guess SOL once again. 😡</text>

Nice cosy atmosphere. Unfortunately my experience was not the best. I asked the receptionist about any vegetarian soups and per her recommendation bought the baked potato soup. I found out after few bites that it has smoked bacon in it. Next time I will make sure to check the ingredients myself and not to trust the welcoming panera staff there.<//Review>

Very bad experience. Walked in order soup and sandwich to go. The lady at rhe register did greet, looked like she was annoyed taking my order had an actual grouchy face. I waited 20 min. Then finally asked where my order was... another annoyance to her. All the cashiers had frowns on there face. Not a happy place...Got home, hair in my soup and very little Turkey on the sand. Couldn't eat it. I paid 11. For absolutely nothing. I wont go back and dont recommended anyone going to eat there.<//review>

We just got a You Pick Two. The plain ceasar salad was only about 1" deep with lettuce and about 10 croutons. What a rip off. I took a photo, but I cannot post. That mac and cheese was tasty  but such a waste of money.</Review>

Coffee was out and staff almost seemed put out to make more. What coffee was there was like warm. Ordered two sandwiches and it took over 20 minutes to bring to the table.  Don't understand the service as there was less than 10 people here and nobody in line ahead of us.  Go up the hill to Panera in Grossmont Center!!!!< /review>

By far the worst service.  After the food came out cold I asked for my money back.  The manager argued with me about the whereabouts of the food which had already been taken to the back by an employee. He then demanded that I return the drinks in order to receive a full refund.  Don’t waste your time or money here.</text>

This Panera is no good. The entire restaurant smelled like garbage literal garbage. Go to the grossmont location or the santee location instead.</text>

Every time I eat at a Panera they like to let you know before 9pm that they close at 9pm and I think if you are open til 9pm you should be open til 9pm . I'm done.  Food is way over priced for the horrible service.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

The employees seemed much friendlier than the Panera near my house. But the line was also kind of long. Otherwise standard Panera experience.< /Review>

If you’re looking for something of value... it’s not Panera. This is the saddest portion of a sandwich ever.< /review>

Panera sandwiches and soups are very good. I tried going through the drive-thru; the wait was quite long.  I ordered a pastry with my meal; I was charged, but they didn't include it in my to-go bag.</Review>

Great first experience here! I usually go to the Grossmont Center Panera location, and it always has 20min lines out the door. My fiance and I came to this location instead before and used their convenient drivethrough. From the time i entered the drivethrough to the time i got my order must of been no more than 5 minutes tops. This is definitely our new go-to location</review>

<review>By far hands down the worst Panera in San Diego. The management is God awful. They never have things ready on time. They clearly dont do inventory because they are always "out" of whatever you want.  Occasionally when they do have it the quality is poor. Customer service is poor. I never have these issues at the Grossmont or Clairemont locations or in Chula Vista only the El Cajon location. Do yourself a favor and spend your money and time elsewhere.< /review><user_name>Name Brand< /user_name>< Resp>

Sat at table by door. Spoke for twenty minutes on a phone.ate some bread.ordered a free thing off the app. Bread okay. Cool thing I came in with to talk on and apply for work on went away. The man sitting behind me may have taken it when I went to register my app and my card.  I saw the camera. I asked to speak to a manager. Chris came in. Chris took down my name and my number. Chris did not get back to me. If anyone on staff there would know where I put my phone down via that technical thing then please say don't have a nice day. In other words your not welcome to my in the mind thing.after I reported it as stolen, I called it a computer
The man I spoke to named Chris said I hadn't had anyone sitting nearby me. A lie. I said computer because in my mind it was. I put my credit card in it. I stored my own address in it. I did not steal it. In fact I had still payments to make on it. Usually always is not making sense.its always or it's gone. Fresh is a lie ..when they put two and two together and make five fingers steal your to the hand thing away and then bark how are you doing today.thats not service with a smile.thats sc*mag with a mood to make to explain his lame job. Or lack of a job.its like that all over the place. S*iMac hockey.who can I impune  and get me out of this place before a new immigrant can ruin it. Duh.its a milieu yeah yeah< /text>

The food at this truck is consistent/delicious. The two women working the truck are kind and make the food with love. This spot has been good to me and my wife for yrs now. Thanks for the good food and great service. Check them out y'all 👌</Text>

Every taco wagon makes one or 2 things better than everything else. Sanchez makes great shredded chicken and delicious carne asada. The people are super friendly and they always thank you for coming when leaving.</review>

My favorite taco truck within the Turlock and Winton areas. I love the quesadilla supreme, carne asada, con todo. Last I checked, that goes for 7.50 there but well worth it</review>

<review>This was our first time at this taco truck. It not bad! We got 1 nachos supreme and 1 burrito supreme con asada. Both were decent. My daughter isnt a spicy person and the nachos were covered with jalepenos. She removed them as she ate, but she ate it!! The burrito supreme had everything in it. I wouldve like some crema inside it, but the flavor was good.

I would definitely come back here to try other items.< /review>< pictures>

The taco truck is called el gueros. I had a chicken quesadilla. It would have been better if they didn't skimp on the"Chicken." My friends had a sope and a burrito supreme. They seemed to have enjoyed it. I have had better food at other food trucks... I seen a lady bring her food back, not sure why... It was alright. Judge for yourself. Oh, I don't know why my quesadilla picture didn't come up. But it had iceberg lettuce some fresh salsa and a few slices of avacado and some other salsa on the side that was spicy...< /Text>

<Review>I can't think of a worse taco truck in turlock, everytime I order a burrito it's full of beans & rice (NO MEAT) well hardly any, the only reason I still go there is bcuz they open till 11pm I get off wrk late sometimes & wen I do go here I order tacos, they cook the meat good & the tacos are on corn tortillas not wheat that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>This is a new Taiwanese restaurant specializing in bento boxes in cute packaging. It's only opened a month or so and could take a while to get the food ready. However, the food quality is top notch and really tasty and you can taste the care the chefs there put into making these dishes. The operation is still work in progress and can be a bit chaotic but at least the staff are friendly and try their best to take care of your order.
Can recommend.</text><user_name>DANNY KidSuper LIN</user_name>< pics>

<Review>I am a chicken lover so I ordered basil popcorn chicken and five spices fried chicken steak square! Amount of food was plenty for me (so I ended up eating two separate meals with it) and the taste was amazing! It was crispy and so juicy!! I am assuming they marinated the chicken meat and then fried it, because the taste was coming out from the meat as well as the batter. Side dishes came along with the main dish we're also yummy, it was very interesting to taste authentic Taiwanese flavor!</Review>< Pics>

Heard about this place from a friend and decided to take the family to give it a try during their soft opening. There were a lot of people waiting for their orders and we did have to wait a little bit for ours but it was well worth it! I tried their beef brisket square with the popcorn chicken and super fruit tea. My wife had the salmon, combination sandwich and cheese creme mango green tea. Got the kids some crispy tofu and oyster mushrooms. Everything came very neatly packaged in a bento box with a variety of sides that complemented the dishes very well.

Overall we enjoyed our first experience here and cant wait to try the other items on their menu! I am sure they will learn from this soft opening and use it to improve their wait time and work flow. That's what a soft opening is for, right? I can't help but laugh at some of these kids crying about how they didn't get their food instantly. It's a new business. Give them a break. These things take time!< /text>

The bento boxes are yummy.  Have been here 2 times and my family loves it. I usually don’t write a review but today, I have been experienced a great customer service so I would like to share. We picked our order and found out we miss a main course for one of our bento orders when we got home. I called the store and they offered to deliver the missing dish. They came very fast and surprise me with an extra drink. I didn’t ask for it but am glad they took extra step for it. Great service!!! Will recommend to my family and friends!<//Review>

<review>Per the cashier’s recommendation, I had the grilled chicken leg square and the taro ball. She was very polite and helpful. The chicken leg has a very unique flavor and tasted very juicy! The taro ball had a soft consistency and crumbled delightfully in my mouth. I can’t wait to taste the other menu items!</review>< time>

Reasonable pricing with decent portion and taste. Not only the food quality, but the dining experience is also good after driving home. I guess it’s because of the to-go box they use that sufficiently separates the source between dishes. Personally, I don't like mixing flavors, especially Chinese food that happens more often. Definitely revisit and recommend.<//Text>

New taiwanese place in a great location (not in Cupertino cluster yay). Got their bentos which are so cutely packaged and great to go. Definitely a covid era launch haha. The crispy chicken is yummy and peppery, tastes authentic. I also got the bean curd side which was good (though fyi cold as it states).<//Text>

They have fancy bento design ..very different from other stores. Their fried items are worth trying. Bentos are at the high end. Lots of parking spaces.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I have been driving by this restaurant and have been noticing a lot of people picking up food each day. So I decided to give it a try to see what all the fuss was about.

It turned out to be a Taiwanese restaurant that also serves boba and snacks. I've never really had Taiwanese food before but the food fit my Korean taste buds very well! I ordered the salmon dish and it came in the cutest bento box with a lot of different yummy sides. Topped it off with a nice refreshing boba too.

The online ordering system was very convenient, the restaurant looked super clean and new, and the staff were all so friendly!

I will be frequenting this place for sure to try out all of the other dishes. Since we have all been working like crazy from home and no longer have the luxury of free lunch at the office, these local restaurant are the perfect lifesavers. Who has time to cook at home these days??<//text>

<Text>not really taste as the picture shown. Not very surprise, just normal dish. The pork in B2 still had foul pork smell. The wait time is long today. Do not understand why it will take some long. Aren't those dishes supposed to cook in a large portion and then just distribute them rather than cooking each one at a time?</Text><Rate>2<//Rate><userid>118194680940492827916</userid><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x808fcbef6f45be01:0x60ba66dcbbd9cf2</GmapID><username>Zawing Lee</username>< response>

We appreciate your feedback and your comments can empower our team to lift the service quality and eventually meet your expectation.\n\nWe may have let you down once, but I promise we will try our best to not let it happen a second time.\nIf you still have confidence on us and like our food, please feel free to come back in the future, we will be ready.\n\nHave a happy orange day!\nGrace @ Orange Square'}< /Response>

Never got the food I ordered after having waited in line for one hour and 20 minutes.  The kitchen could not find my order.  Poorly planned and executed!!!  Pick up line wrapped around the building.  People placed orders a day/night before.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very delicious bento, I like the dried tofu and celery, which is healthy and delicious. The sirloin is worth recommending. Taiwanese taste is fast and worth recommending.

I was greeted by the owners who were friendly and helpful. It took some searching but with patience they picked out the right replacement. It fit! Looked lovely! Took it home and fixed it. Thank you for making my day my peeps. Happy Valentine's Day!

This pawn shop is amazing , we found it by accident while on a trip to the high desert. We had 2 relatively expensive items with us and needed between $80 and $100 for a few days , the guy that greeted us when we came in gave us $80 for the cheaper item we brought in (about 2 years ago we got into a scrape and had to pawn the same item (power tools) in San Bernardino and it got $50) and allowed us to keep our more expensive item. These people are not your average pawn shop by far , apparently the guy had told us that if we had come back within 10 days to retrieve the property that he would give us a discount on the interest , we came back before the 10 days and sure enough he gave us the discount that I didn't even remember he offered 😀. Thank you guys at Hesperia pawn shop for operating in the professional and compassionate manner that you do , you are light years ahead of any other pawn shop I have dealt with.<//review>

We found ourselves temporarily in need of some $$$ due to an unforseen financial hit that we took and went down to the high desert to see if the pawn shops were different down there than the ones in San Bernardino and I'm glad we did. These people were courteous , compassionate and professional beyond all expectation. We didn't go in with the highest expectations but left blown away , we brought multiple items with us thinking it was going to be like San Bernardino where a $400 item thats close to new condition gets you $25 -$30 if your lucky but NOT at Hesperia pawn shop , they are more than fair with what they offer you and make the process as streamlined as it could possibly be. Seriously folks if you are in need of a pawn brokers services and happen to be anywhere around this area you should really stop in and see these people they are amazing.< /Review>

They are awesome!!!  My brother had passed away and I did not have The pawn slips. They held the Jewelry until  It became their property and then they let me buy it back.  This meant so much to me because one of the rings was my great grandmother's wedding ring. Think you so much for making one thing through this process easy..... This place is honest And caring which is rare for a pawnshop. I recommend everyone to go here thank you again!!!<//Review>

I have done business there for many years, and I would never go anywhere else.  I have always been treated with the utmost respect and dignity.  Never have I ever felt  like  I was
being judged or looked-down on when I needed to pawn an item.  Everyone there is very understanding and friendly.  They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. They are great people.</review>

Out of all the other shops around, their customer service and price is the best. I am a return customer and have always gotten a fair price and they are willing to work with me. Very nice people and nice shop. I will very much be returning next time. They were willing to work with me when I was in a pinch, and that goes to show how caring they are and how this shop loves their community. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to come here for any of their pawn shop needs. This shop has been here for a long time, they are very knowledgeable and Hesperia Pawn Shop should be a model pawn shop for everyone out there.</text>

I went there to sell some golf clubs I had sitting in my garage, they said they wouldn't take them but reffered me to the pawn shop/ gun broker around the corner so I did (they're owned by the same person) the guy there asked me how much I wanted for them I said like 30 bucks, he then basically accused me of trying to sell him stolen clubs because I wasn't aware that the clubs were Worth more than that. The manager then walked up and informed me that he owned the shop I came from also and claimed I told them a different story. Lol my story never changed but okay</review>

This is the best indoor rock climbing gym in Orange County by far!  The people that work here are all super cool and really friendly and helpful!  The climbing routes are always really well thought out and they are great about changing out the routes on a regular basis so that they don’t get stale and there is always something new to climb. Also the place is very reasonably priced!  We come here often and will continue to do so!  If you want a cool spot to have some fun this is your place!<//review>

<Text>Since my review...years ago, I've become a Touchstone member and LA.B has become my second home.  Since then, this gym has up'd their game in not just bouldering, but in fitness classes as well. LA.B facilities are not as advanced as So Cal Touchstone's other bouldering gyms (Hollywood Boulders and Cliffs of Id) as they don't have designated training rooms, top rope area, saunas, and more.  However, the place is intimate and has the friendliest people!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Such a great place to climb. It's a great climbing community and ownership fosters that sense of community. You may find bigger gyms, but you'll never find a better gym.< /Review>

<Text>Visited this gym for a competition.
My daughter was in competition required isolation, and ended up forgetting here lululemon jacket in the isolation space.
Called the gym and they identified the jacket... I emailed a pre paid postage label and it's been 8 weeks... still no jacket.
Called once, spoke with the same person who remembered me,  she said she'd ask again... still no jacket.
Bummed, now iI've lost over $100 on a jacket I know they have... plus the shipping I paid for.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4dEIDtk0tLmVKiItPbzkcf0neRRV6W1_-wMQ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIHu3lxjLDsz6QwuIjjgCnJaFJmbBcobQ6B8yU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPilmdsgmG2sRi7Se4cDE9DilwgMidRIw7GK3Tn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<text>Wonderful gym and wonderful people! The staff is always friendly and always helpful, new routes just often enough for you to finish off projects but not get bored of the same climbs. Huge facility with a new upper climbing area and showers now installed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to start or continue their climbing journey<//text>< name>

I've never been climbing before without a harness, but this place made it easy to transition. Obvious I started out on the harness then transitioned to the walls without them. Once you understand the color scheme of the walls everything makes sense. Don't assume all colors are fair game. That was my first mistake. The staff if very friendly and is willing to show you the ropes, very laid back and patient. Will  visit again.<//Text>

I've climb just about every gym from San Diego to LA for the last 6 years and this is by far my favorite gym with the best community of a real climbing folk you're going to find. The first day I showed up and climbed, everybody came by to say hi, they all remembered my name and said Goodbye to me on my way out. Where else do you find that? 10/10 would recommend to anyone who's in the climbing community already or is looking for a place to start.< /Text>

<Review>This is by far my favorite climbing gym to go to. I have been going here since I was a junior in high school and it has only gotten better over the years. The owners, Trevor, Dillon, and Brent, and the entire staff are all kind and encouraging people. Any time I have climbed there I have been cheered on by the fellow climbers, and the staff has helped me solve routes multiple times. The environment is professional, and at the same time I still get the local gym feel where everyone knows each other. I will definitely be getting a membership again here soon, and I recommend this place to all of my friends and family. Thanks for the amazing times and memories!!</Review>< pics>

Recently had the chance to check out this gym over the 4th of July weekend and it did not disappoint! Came here with a group of friends and the staff were so helpful. We got a tour of the facility and received instructions on how to do a few climbs so we knew what we were doing. There were plenty of walls & climbs to try out and next time we will have to take the class to learn how to top rope. Definitely recommend this gym if you’re looking to try climbing for the first time or even if you’re an experienced climber!< /text>

From top roping, lead climbing, and bouldering, all climbs are challenging and dynamic to keep any climber interested and encouraged to practice. Whether you are a first time climber or an experienced veteran, there are many different levels available. Lastly, and most importantly, Aesthetic's staff are friendly and personable. They are always willing to assist with a problem or just to talk. You will not be let down by checking out this gym.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Amazing place. I love to come after work since it is open late. The employees are super helpful and the environment is very friendly. The monthly membership is definitely worth it if you like it.<//Text>

<Review>So far I've been here, sender one, hanger 18 Riverside and hanger 18 Lake Forest. If your focus is bouldering then this is the best place for unique and inventive routes so far. There is a good variety of holds, surfaces and angles. There are also sport, rope, and a few training rooms including a very fun boogie board for balance!

Great if you want to get away from a corporate atmosphere, the staff climbs, everyone is pretty friendly and very relaxed.

They have classes and training, but if you're high maintenance you might want to steer clear. This place is pretty tucked away and doesn't have a large staff like you would see at a place like sender one, but it's also like half the cost, and if you just need to get in climb and get out without all the extra bother then you found your place.

They have incorporated a slack line at times (which you should demand that they reinstall). Climbing rope, rings, and you should request silks too or any other feature that's appropriate.

They also have a group on, so make sure to check that out and save yourself some money .

Climb on!< /Review></record>

<text>Friendly staff and great boulder setting here. Reasonable price and includes all rentals. Members get 2 guest passes per month, so its easy to get people to try something new out! Really chill vibes and music playing throughout the gym. Awesome place to make friends and have a good time climbing.</text>< time>

I hadn't gone rock climbing in a couple years, so I was definitely looking for a nonjudgmental place to go. The staff was incredible, and they were very helpful in teaching my friends and I the basics. We started with top-rope and the staff was very patient and helpful showing us the methods. After about 5-10 minutes of training, they actually let us belay one another and left us on our own (The ropes were secured in the ground, they took the highest safety measures possible to ensure the well being of their customers). The staff was always nearby if you needed them, but they gave you a lot of space and privacy if you didn't seek them out, which was very nice. Also, they had very mellow background music playing which gave it a calm and tranquil atmosphere that really let you get in the zone. Oh, and of course the big one: price. $15 for a full day pas that includes the harness, shoes, and a chalk pack?? Simply incredible. I honestly felt like I had cheated them out by the amount of enjoyment I got out of my visit for such a small price. Simply put, if you're in the southern California region and looking for a place to rock climb, go to Aesthetic Climbing Gym, you won't regret it.< /Review>

This is the best place I've climbed in Southern California. The staff is friendly and all of the patrons want to help and teach new climbers about the craft. Rates are cheap and the place is well maintained. Staff is always friendly and awesome to talk to. I spend just as much time climbing as I do hanging out and talking with people in the gym.<//Review>

Absolutely amazing. Taller walls than Hangar 18 in San Clemente. Bouldering, top roping, lead climbing, this gym has it all. They reset the routes every couple months. They have competitions, classes, beer and bouldering Fridays, and they're open late every night except Sunday. Membership price is extremely reasonable, especially if you have a student ID.<//Text>

My favorite climbing gym in Orange County. The focus is heavily on bouldering but the route setting and community is fantastic. Don't let the fact that it looks like another office from the outside, this is the best place to practice your climbing skills.</Review>

Nice climbing gym. A little small but packed with complex routes. rope walls are a little short compared to one other gym I frequented. A little dirty, 75% of the gym is floored with crash pads but the 25% of it is dusty with sawdust in the corners. I'd say it's totally worth its membership price. A great value option compared to sender 1<//Review>

It was my first time going to a rock climbing gym so I didn't have any expectations to begin with. I learned that they had both bouldering and harness climbing. It was small for what I thought a rock climbing gym would look like... Their wasn't a whole lot of variety. It felt very local, the people there seemed like they all know each other and go regularly. The people there were all very laid back. The front desk was eager and willing to help.< /text>

Great place to climb for all levels.  Bouldering is definitely the strong point at this gym, but beginning top rope routes are available as well as a lead climb section.  The bouldering section has a wide variety of easy to difficult routes, with lots of 18 foot top outs.  There are also multiple caves/large roofs to climb over that add a great dynamic to it.  Definitely the best bouldering I've seen nearby.  The top rope routes are great for beginners, and they were very accommodating to my younger siblings that are new to the sport.  They also had a couple of good-length slacklines set up.  I thought pricing was very reasonable at $15 per person (with all rentals included), but we came with a group and got a discount by getting a 10 visit punch card.</review>

It was our first time climbing for a lot of us in our 10+ group. Everyone that worked at the gym was exceptionally nice and helpful even though we were complete noobs. They answered all our questions and showed us techniques without talking down to us. I liked that they have ping pong and Foosball for little breaks between climbing and are reasonably priced.< /review>

{'time': 1487317918384, 'text': 'Good evening Bella, sorry to hear of what you think about  Aesthetic. We are actually one of the larger climbing gyms in Orange County with over 10,000 sq ft of climbing terrain and we hold our own being one of the only family run gym in Orange County. We do recognize that with our recent addition of 1000 sq ft of new rope terrain it has gotten a little busier than usual in the bouldering area, but construction will be done next week and there will be a large abundance of new routes to try out. Also with the 5000 sq ft of bouldering terrain, people seem to get their fair share of climbs in. We are the only gym in Southern California with competition graded padding from Asana Climbing, who actually were the padding sponsor to US Bouldeirng Nationals (one of the highest level competitions in the country) Granted our gym does have a little bit of a maze factor to it, but we feel that makes us unique instead of being like every other climbing gym out there. Hope you come back and check us out when we are done with the new additions!!'}< /Resp>

Climbing is on the rise. Literally. My years at Solid Rock Gym saw little growth or expansion, but when the Lake Forest location closed Orange County was left with a void. Since then gyms have popped up all over Southern California and dare I say it climbing is going mainstream. It's modern, it's adaptive and the training ground for the TOP climbers. Well these guys sure had a dream to fill that void with really what climbing has needed in OC and beyond.

I heard rumors of a San Clemente gym and now there is TruHold in Mission Viejo, Sharma's new gym coming, obviously Hangar 18, Mesa in SD, Vital bouldering walls in Carlsbad, but let's be honest if you don't go to Rockreation or Rock City the 2 most established gym's besides SRG when they left you were stuck driving way out of your way. Aesthetic and Truhold serve a much bigger population which is great for us as a community.

The Arndt brothers (Dillon & Trevor) and Jeremy Meza have done a great job addressing a lot of the downfalls of previous gyms in the area and abroad. Not to sound like an elitist, but too often kids are exposed to climbing in more of a babysitting way, relying on excellent gym employees to wrangle them, keep their interest and whatnot. Having a staging area for comps, having event specific area's for kids to have their parties and a separate vertical top rope area keeps everybody safe and happy. The Yosemite and Joshua Tree room are decorated so well it's almost a shame kids will likely thrash it eventually. Members and nonmember alike fully enjoy the top out boulder, training room, and top ropes. Lead area requires the passing of testing certification. The training room lets people get on intervals where you can crank out and hours' worth of toproping or bouldering in half the time. Like I said earlier gyms are the training ground and with these new state of the art padding systems you don't have to worry about dirty rocks ever again. Makes us setters happy because it's less we have to clean. I really dig that there are bouldering specific gym's now and that new gym's like this still offer it all. Competitions are a lot of work, but a lot of reward. Something 25-50% of gym's choose not to do for a variety of reasons. ACG had a comp almost immediately, showcasing this brand new facility. These guys are on a facebook media blasting tear doing more for marketing than I've ever seen done for any climbing gum. Oh technology and the internet. Good setting and maintenance is key to keeping people happy and safe. Testing limits and ego's. You'll find challenge and reward regardless of your skill level here. You couldn't find more friendly, honest and humble owners  and with gorilla strong climbers to newbies training here every day welcoming all with open arms, you'll find your place here. As soon as  have my surgery's to fix a few old climbing injuries I'll be back here training again.</text>

<review>This park look really clean, no gang tagging, I was there in the morning so I didn't see much activity. I did see a elderly couple walk around a few laps. Back in the days probably different story but now its alot calmer. 👍🏽💯< /review>< userid>

<Text>Love the grass area, baseball field and basketball court. I don't like that the restrooms are closed most of the time and you can find at least one homeless at any time. Other than that it's a great park very close to fwy 71, 57 and 10.</Text>< Rating>

This park has too much trash everywhere. The restrooms were locked, so everyone could not use them. They have some playground for kids. Overall, this park was not that great for parties or anything.< /Text>

<review>Swap Meets r fun, great exercise and money saving ventures. U must be careful though, some deals look great until u get them home: don't fit right, not exactly what u thought it was, etc.
Of course, there r public bathroons, I wouldn't use on a bet. 😬🤤🙄
Great food and great deals 2b found. If u have an affinity against the sun, dress appropriately, it's hot!
Some deals rival those downtown LA.
parking is always a headache in these places.
So, b patient. Dress appropriately. I'm sure u will find something 😁 if nothing else, a great day out with friends and good eating. So go have fun and take a friend.</review>< time>

It's OK. Not like I remember it. Before you can barely find parking and it was always packed. Now lots of parking. People mostly selling retail merchandise.< /text>

<Text>Anything you're looking for they have! Pants? Shirts? Car parts? Self care? Undergarments? Shoes? Toys? Live music? Dancing? Junk food? Lunch? You need it, they got it. Entrance is $1 per adult children under 12 years are free. Sundays are definitely better for shopping since there is more stands than Saturday. They usually don't charge the entrance fee after 2:30ish when the swap meet is about to close.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I use to come here as a child so it use to be fill with a lot of stands. Now it's mostly empty they started to use part of what the swap meet use to be into parking for more cars. You pay an entrance fee which I believe is 75¢ but don't quote me on that. I use to love it but now there's not much to buy there.< /text>< Pics>

It's your typical swap meet. A little bit of everything. Food, toys, fruits and veggies with a side of Live music. You can even buy brand new furniture or buy a house. My husband even tried a dried grasshopper.<//text>

<userid>102697578695908456961<//userid><text>I love the night swap meet & have been coming here for years! coming here is as equally satisfying to me as going to the mall. the only downside to this being a swap meet and all is that some items are priced the same as the mall. I don't mind it though , there is amazing stuff and whatever you're looking for you're sure to find it ! my sister on the other hand hates swap meets and walking around so she usually just listens to the music and shows that they have to offer! So u can either shop till you drop or grab a beer and enjoy the show and tunes.</text>< Rating>

There is less than half of the capacity of vendors set up. At least on a Saturday. Also not much foot traffic which is a plus. I got what i needed so worked out for me but not too much of a selection otherwise<//Text>

I like that there is a lot of stuff you can find here, for a very cheap price. There is a pretty good restaurant inside, people dance here as well!</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Ami I love it because they offer phone tablets and cables to charge the battery. Television antennas. Clear protective glasses for tablets and selulars in line 13 is the maximum you find of all good pressure and the best are friendly. Although they only open Saturdays and Sundays. Ailo better have music in bibo where everyone dances to saw
