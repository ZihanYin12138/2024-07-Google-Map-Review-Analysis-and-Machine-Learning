<review>Office Depot always has bright shining faces when you walk in the door!  We love the deals on HP Ink and Printers.  We ended up with the HP OfficeJet Pro 7740 and it will blow your socks off with Tabloid Size 11 x 17 capabilities for solar, roofing, and gutter plans!< /review><Date>1605715958578< /Date>< Pictures>

What a rip off and total failure.
Office Depot you better fix your interface. One side doesn’t communicate to the other.

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Horrible experience with sales associate and her manager.  Because the color of my skin she did not think I would buy a nice pen that I found half off on amazon by the way.  Tried returning it waited an hour later for her to tell me that I would have to wait 7 days so corporate could email me my receipt.  Her manager comes over with the same routine looking at me if I was lying about buying the pens at office depot.  Finally they found on my rewards and gave me my money back.  Guess because I was brown they assumed I wouldnt have a business and never bother to mention they could look up my receipt with my phone number. Horrible!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

Disinfecting wipes are overpriced $7.98 for 80 count package. Cashier on Sunday said I could return the 2 packages if they weren't opened. Cashier today says they are "final sale" items.</review>

< review>
The worst Customer service ever. I went there for printing services, and that part great. The gentleman was very helpful and kind. After having that  part of service completed, I continued to shop in the store for school supplies. I noticed an elderly lady in a wheelchair, who was frustrated because no one did not take the time or have the patience to help her. When the lady got to the cash register, the cashier whose name was Naeomi was very rude to this lady. The elderly woman had ask the cashier to put her bag on back of her wheelchair, but the cashier did not want to help her out, but did it anyways since I was there witnessing everything. When it came my turn to be checked out I told her, "Customer service is first." Her response was, "yea sure, right." Because I didn't want to make a scene, I held my peace, finished my transaction, and left the store. People should leave there problems at home, and not bring them to work.  Sooo F****** sad. I'm pissed. No respect for yourself, the elderly, or Customer service.<//review>

Horrible! Took my laptop in to see why it wouldn't connect to wifi and they basically charged me $50 to tell me what I already knew. They are a rip off. And the "asst. manager" was extremely rude when I asked for my money back since the diagnostic was suppose to be free! So I'm $50 short and still have the same problem with my laptop! These people have no idea what they are doing when it comes to fixing computers or customer service!</Review>

< Review>
SHOULDNT STEREOTYPE PEOPLE! I accept the fact that because i have tattoos and dont wear khakis and button up polos that im going to draw unnecessary attention especially when shopping. Ive worked retail, i get it. However, its pretty annoying when i go in there to shop and one of the workers (i was too upset to get her name but believe she was a manager. She had short hair and was heavy set) literally followed me throughout the store acting as if she was putting things away or whatnot. So after i realized what was going on i decided to leave, in which of course, she followed me to the front of the store to watch me leave. Its sad that we live in a world where things like this still exist and i am even understanding of the fact that its because a few bad apples as to why practically everything in the stores has a sensor on it but i draw the line when im basically getting harrassed when all i wanted to do was get a couple art supplies to do a drawing. I will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS STORE AGAIN. I would never wish bad on anyone however i do wish that lady experiences something similar to what i did so that maybe she will be more mindful that just because of how a person looks does not make them a bad person. Im debating calling their corporate because of how appalled i was of this womans behavior!!!!<//Review>

Queen nails is such a place to get away from it all. They have very good customer service, their prices are fair, and its welcoming place to be. They do a very good job on your feet and nails. Would be nice if they renovated but its still clean place.< /review>

<text>Very good experience.  It was busy but worth the wait.  My toenails are pretty rough to work on.  They took their time and did a great job giving me a thorough pedacure.  My feet feel great!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I've been going to Queen Nails for over 10 years and the young lady that does my nails is Nancy she is awesome. Everyone there is very professional and friendly if you're ever in Rialto Can and you need your nails and feet done stop by Queen Nails if you want them done right.< /review>

<text>Arrived at 6:10 pm for a fill not a complete service was asked to come back tomorrow I asked if I could get an appt they said no. They told me they open at 10 I replied I work if I come back it will be same time so they say ok, as in we do not care. They had 2 customers and 3 techs... I guess I will take my money to another place.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c34d70751b1265:0x9244bc4e6a4e5a28</Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

The monthly charge for a box is low and the rate for receiving packages isn't too bad. (it would be cheaper if Amazon would consolidate orders into 1 package like they used too) They moved next door to a bigger/better area. They seem really organized and there are rules that need to be followed.< /text>

I came to pay the rental for my PO Box here today April 9th, 2020. In the middle of the pandemic of COVID-19. I expected to pay the regular rate of $45 per 6 months.

Turns out that the rate went UP TO $60!! per 6 months. In increase of $15!! So much for trying to help small businesses in the middle of a crisis! Bad Business practice👎< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>After 15 years of giving my business to this man, I was out of the country from July to November. I found out today my mail box was canceled and given to another person. I withstood bad and expensive service in exchange for a stable US address. By bad service I mean no phone, a couple of lost packages, no 24-hour access, and excessive charges for packages not collected. Now I have to change my 15 yo address to the bank and SENTRI. So if you are going to open a mail box  don't do it here.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Time>1485459597533<//Time><rate>2</rate><review>I've been with these guys for about 7 years.  At the beginning I did not mind the hours, having to rush over to make it in time...they are extremely punctual at closing (curiously not so much on opening), adn after 3 days they charge double; but since back then small envelopes were 25 cents.
But now we have those same envelopes at $1.50, and there is nothing below that.  Yearly cost has not increased much but the per package cost is way too much now, and the consistency of the price per package is based on the person that decides and how they feel that day, so a package that is the same size and weight can be one day $2.50, then the next is $3.50.
Oh, and by the way, they will literally close the door in front of your face (twice now because I was waiting for the parking spot in front of the place to free up) because according to their clock it was 6pm on the dot. All the pleading in the world will not work, so if it's 6 and you are a block away...just skip it and prevent getting mad.
I am sharing the box with a buddy and we are looking for other options that can improve on any of these points, cost per package, open hours (I live in Tijuana and crossing the border can ruin my trip to pickup packages), or the cost per year.
Oh, and the phone is just for show, and them calling as others have said...they have never answered so track your packages.  Also, if your package was delivered at USPS for pick up by them, give it at least a day, better two days after they deliver since they pick up only in the morning. I've drove there rushing to get in time with a confirmation that it was picked up by them that day, only to find out it's not there yet, so it's probably sitting in someones car not yet sent to the business; be warned.
Good luck and if you find something better, let me know.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) The location is very good, the service is very bad, most of the employees serve in a bad mood. They argue that they do not have the power to search for a package even if you show the tracking guide, the system is very archaic, to claim a package you fill out a form and in forty-eight hours they respond by leaving a note in your mailbox, they should at least call by phone to notify. We received a damaged package and they were not responsible, it was apparent to the naked eye that it was crushed, we are left wondering if it arrived or they damaged them since it is observed that they have the packages on the floor and piled up. I will not contract services with them again.

(Original)
La ubicación es muy buena, el servicio es muy malo, la mayoría de los empleados atienden de mal humor. Argumentan no tener facultades para buscar un paquete aunque muestres la guía de rastreo, el sistema es muy arcaico, para reclamar algún paquete llenas un formato y en cuarenta y ocho horas te responden dejando una nota en tu buzón, al menos deberían de llamar por teléfono para notificar. Recibimos un paquete dañado y no se hicieron responsables, se percibía a simple vista que estaba aplastado, nos queda la duda si así llegó o ellos los dañaron ya que se observa que tienen los paquetes en el piso y amontonados. No volveré a contratar servicios con ellos.</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The price of the individual mailbox is very cheap compared to other places but what you save you will spend on charges to collect your packages, which to begin with depends on the judgment of the person who processes it. Oh and that if you find an individual mailbox, there never is.

Their hours are very short and many of the times I run to the post office and I am in a hurry, they have told me that they close me because I have a lot of line.

In Christmas shopping seasons there is no parking and it can take from 30min to 1 hour to find parking just to pick up your package.

They lose the packages and become the ones that the virgin speaks to them.

THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED SO FAR, I had never had to be yelled at and made faces at me just because I ask that my turn be respected, because by the way, apart from having a very archaic way of processing packages, no they have a system to know who's next. And if you dare to ask for your shift to be respected, the staff will yell at you, make faces at you and make noises with their mouths letting you know that you are bothering them, as if they were doing you a favor.

I DON'T THINK OF RENEWING MY CONTRACT, let the assholes that leave them put up with them. CASM.

El precio del buzón individual es muy barato comparado con otros lugares pero lo que te ahorras te lo vas a gastar en cobros para recoger tus paquetes, que para empezar depende del juicio de la persona que lo procesa. Ah y eso sí encuentras un buzón individual, nunca hay.

Su horario es muy corto y muchas de las veces voy corriendo al correo y ando a las prisas, me ha ticadi que me cierran por que me toco mucha fila.

En epocas de compras navideñas no hay estacionamiento y puedes tardar de 30min hasta 1 hora en encontrar estacionamiento solo para recoger tu paquete.

Pierden los paquetes y se hacen los que la viergen les habla.

EL PEOR SERVICIO AL CLIENTE QUE HE RECIBIDO HASTA AHORA, nunca me habia tocado que me gritaran y me hicieran caras solo por que pido que se respete mi turno, por que por cierto, aparte de tener una forma muy arcaica de procesar los paquetes, no tienen un sistema para saber quien sigue. Y si te atreves a pedir que se te respete tu turno, el personal te va a gritar, te va a hacer caras y te va a hacer ruidos con la boca haciendote saber que los molestas, como si te estuvieran haciendo un favor.

NO PIENSO RENOVAR MI CONTRATO, que los aguanten los pendej@s que se dejen. CASM.< /Review><Name>Lidya Toscano<//Name>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The only problem I have had as a customer of this place is the price. The service is too expensive to receive parcels, which you save on free shipping, here you pay from 1.50 to 10 dollars per package, if you make purchases with Amazon or Ebay make sure they send you everything in a single box or the least amount of packages possible otherwise you will lose money.

The only redeemable thing is the place where it is very accessible when crossing San Ysidro, it is open on Sundays until 3pm and the staff is friendly.

El servicio es demasiado caro por recibir paqueteria, lo que te ahorras en el envio gratis aqui lo pagas desde 1.50 hasta 10 dlls por paquete, si realizas compras con Amazon o Ebay asegurate que te manden todo en una sola caja o la menor cantidad de paquetes posible de lo contrario perderas dinero.

Lo unico rescatable es el lugar donde se encuentra muy accesible al cruzar por San Ysidro, esta abierto los Domingos hasta las 3pm y el personal es amable.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Horrible attention from the staff, they have no idea what packages they have.
0 control by the establishment.
Nothing recommended.

(Translated by Google) The location is fine for me, but it is very expensive. For me the most pleasant experience is with one of the employees (Liz), she always attends me very kindly, she worries that my packages have arrived and tries to make the delivery service fast but I think the owner should have a better storage place or more efficient because I see that Liz does not stop ...... if I had a post office box I would give her work (I give her the little stars).

(Original)
Para mi esta bien la ubicación, pero es muy caro  . Para mi  la experiencia mas agradable es con una de las empleadas ( Liz ) , ella siempre me atiende muy amable, se preocupa porque mis paquetes hayan llegado y trata de hacer que el servicio de entrega sea rápido pero creo que el dueño deberia tener un mejor lugar de almacenamiento o mas eficiente porque yo veo que Liz no para ......si yo tuviera un apartado postal le daria trabajo a ella ( a ella le doy las estrellitas ).</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is the worst experience in the world. They delivered my package to someone else! I was simply told that they do not verify names or signatures so if someone wants to steal your things this is the place where this will happen. It is the worst service crap. I have been a client for more than 20 years and I had never had problems but lately this place is a real fraud, your email is not safe here, at all. They'll lose your stuff, no apologies, they just deliver it to someone else and have other people sign for your mail, beware, your mail is not safe here at all.

(Original)
Es la peor experiencia del mundo. ¡Le entregaron mi paquete a otra persona! Me dijeron simplemente que ellos no verifican nombres ni firmas así es que si alguien quiere robarte tus cosas este es el lugar donde esto sucederá. Es la peor porquería de servicio . He sido clienta desde hace más de 20 años y nunca había tenido problemas pero últimamente este lugar es un verdadero fraude, Tu correo no está seguro aquí, para nada.

(Translated by Google) They have an archaic system, they lose your mail, they bring you around because they have no means of communication. Employees have no power over anything because everything is done by the boss who, curiously, is not there. I do not recommend it

I've been going to this salon for years. The customer service is amazing. The staff is talented and friendly.  The atmosphere is warm and comfortable.
Adam Medeiros utilizes his warm, friendly and enthusiastic  personality to make this lovely salon a pleasurable experience.
It amazes me how he can always tell what the best color, cut and style to suit each individual to their style and personality. Thank you, Adam for always making me look my very best!</text>

<review>My old hairstylist left me in quite a mess. My hair was purple and my cut was uneven.  Jeanette was recommended to me by a good friend.  She spent a lot of time with me and fixed my hair color and gave me a wonderful cut. Very thankful for her and I had a great time too! Very highly recommend!<//review><time>1558806780697</time><GmapID>0x8094c31262a5eb55:0x520eebac794c0d12<//GmapID><Name>Jenny M.</Name><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>101456428059664524737< /userid>< resp>

I get my nails done with Audrey and she does a fantastic job. I bite my nails down to nubs, and other acrylics tend to fall off or be painful after a while. Audrey’s nails lasted two weeks before I needed a fill only because of outgrowth. They were still comfortable and felt just as good as the day she did them. HIGHLY recommend. My whole family goes to her for our nails and we love her. Once you’re a client with Audrey, you’re family.<//text>

Mike did a great job on my hair, and he got me in last minute before I had my graduation. Great price too!<//Review>

<Review>...first time here. I was craving a maple bar (my go-to), and was sitting at a red light. I searched "donuts", and Manley's happened to be 50 yards away. I always judge a donut shop on their maple bars lol.

I might just say that these were the best maple bars I've ever had. Wow, super thick icing, with decadent soft-on-the-inside, slightly crispy-on-the-outside dough. Yum. AND...super nice people behind the counter, AND great prices!? C'mon now.

This is my new go-to place. Awesome prices, great customer service, and amazing maple bars.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

< review>
My family and I just moved to Citrus Heights the end of January and we have been getting the hang of things... especially where the good foods are. We were born and raised in the bay area and love our breakfast bagels so when I found Manley's Donuts let me tell you I WAS SOOOO EXCITED!!

Let me first start by saying that the prices are amazing, so affordable, and makes sense as the owners are from the Bay Area themselves. Definitely felt a kindred spirit in Tom. The environment is so inviting, warm, and loving. Everything is made fresh in store with love and you can tell it from the get go.

We ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese croissant and bagel. These items are so big I knew we were going to be full and satisfied. As we waited for our food to be prepared, Tom and I talked about the Bay and life out in Sac. He gave us a little sample of their Matcha Tea and Ube donuts and even offered to bring our order to the car!! As the pandemic is still creeping around all of us, my mom and I truly deeply appreciated this offer. Tom also let us know if we really want something to be made &held for us or to order and pick up, to call and they are more than happy to help us out.

Thank you sooo much Tom and everyone at Manley's!!! You sure put a smile on our faces today and I personally appreciate you bringing a little bit of home (the bay) to us here in Sac. Stay safe and healthy till next time, see you soon!!<//review>

Great communication and awesome service. Manley's made a special delivery to my dad for Father's Day. He's in an assisted living facility and I can't visit. The pink sprinkled donuts are his favorite and made his day. Thank you so much!< /review>

I've tried a few different fritters around town, and time and time again, it left me longing for Manley's version. They're bigger, fresher, crispier, more apple-y than the others. I've had a few different types of their donuts, and they're very good as well, but the fritter has my heart. ❤️Haha

The shop itself is in a strip mall, next to a nail salon, and a tax shop/insurance office, something like that, near McDonald's (the parking lot can get a bit tight, so be careful). The owners are very nice, and you can tell they know their stuff. Anyway, I highly recommend Manley's if you have a donut craving. Apple Fritter or whatever you want at that time. 🙂 Oh, one more thing, they do accept credit cards, but there's a fee, so bring cash if you are able to. 👍</Review>< pics>

We arrived at 11:15am on a Thursday. The case was 80% EMPTY. The remaining donuts tasted at least 2-3 hrs old. They were fine, but not great. Prices was reasonable though. Paid $4.30 for a glazed buttermilk bar, large chocolate iced bar, chocolate old fashioned, and very large cinnamon roll. The older man working was difficult to understand when we asked what filling the round ones included. I joked that he was closing early given how empty it was. He did not respond.< /Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>The eye exam was ok, the woman was friendly. The rep that helped us just seemed annoyed and like she didn’t even want to be doing what she was doing. No one told us that they are out of network for us, so we wasted an hour looking at frames to only be told that my portion is $384! I knew that was outrageous, but it was only when I went to an eye doctor and and paid $41for the same frames that I knew it was a rip off. Please tell people upfront what they are going to pay, if they have a portion to pay. I had to take two little kids out in the heat after being out for hours to resolve this.< /review><rating>3</rating><UserId.>107651864219518759734<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

I love coming here for my routine eye exam. Their friendliness vibes from all their staff and Dr. Patel is very professional and attentive. They’re really understanding and they don’t pressure you into purchasing supplies from them. They’re very efficient and I’m always in and out of my appointment less than an hour. I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great place to get their prescription, glasses contacts or supplies.< /Review>

Came as a walk-in. Got seen right away after doing paperwork. Took an hour for whole process to be done then I decided to use my own frame and waited for another hour to get my glasses back. Dr. Patel was nice and knowledgeable.< /review>

<Name>Matt McIntyre< /Name><date>1567667307162</date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>My visit with Dr Patel was uplifting to say the least.   Her desire to help people experience a better life through better sight was made absolutely clear by the care and patients she offered throughout each and every step of the process.   I've seen nearly a dozen different Optometrists during my lifetime but after my visit with Dr Patel I have no doubt about who I'll be going to for my eye care needs from this point forward.   Avani Patel is a top notch professional and a world class human being.   Thanks for helping me see the world clearly again.</review>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I use this company for my vision prescription. They are connected to Lens Crafters. So I feel if something was done incorrectly it would be easier to get things fixed as Lens Crafters are my go to place to get glasses.. The experience was good. They are always very nice. This was my second time using them.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Showed up for my eye exam appointment 15 minutes early. Got through the first part of the exam in about 15 minutes. Waited 1 hour for the second part with the doctor. After 1 hour of not being seen before the doctor, i left... Figured after an hour must not be that important to them. There was another person who also waited an hour. Went to another eye doctor to get my exam.</Text>< pics>

Eddie was super great and had tons of energy. My kids were so comfortable and it was all natural. They loved his energy and personality. He was able to get their attention and get some great shots of them just being kids. He didn’t force them to just do the Typical smile or statue like poses. They were able to express themselves and it really brought the pictures more life. He did a great job at coaching us and helping us feel comfortable with positions and poses. Thank you for the beautiful photos of my family. We will definitely book with Love Life Photography again!< /text>

Eddie and Liz at Love Life Photography Are Amazing! Not just because they take great photos (as you can obviously tell from the great reviews), but also because they make you feel so comfortable and so fun to work with! Eddie is hilarious btw! They listen to your ideas of what you want and go the extra mile with shots I couldn't even imagine them taking! They took my college graduation photos, our engagement photos (AT DISNEYLAND!!!), and our wedding photos! But even better (and this is where I would give him 10 stars if I could)....Our wedding was in 2013 and my husband and I have moved twice since. Somewhere along one of the moves, we lost the disc that had all of our wedding photos on it!!!! I reached out to Eddie to just take a shot in the dark and see if he still had them and HE DID!!!! He sent me all of the photos within minutes!!! My husband and I were soooo grateful! I don't know how I have never written a review for him before but I definitely should have!!!! My husband and I cant wait to do another photo shoot with Love Life Photography Again!!!</Text>

Like how to pose and not to have a “California burrito” chin LOL. I ENJOYED every minute of him taking photos of us! I am definitely going to recommend him to everyone one I know from now on. Thank you so much Eddie for making our special day so much more enjoyable. We love you so much!!!!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Love Life Photography is hands down the best! Do not hesitate about using them for your next photoshoot. They are fun, they are flexible, they have great quality pictures that my wife and I will cherish for the rest of our lives! More than anything, the whole experience felt natural. When we brought Eddie and Liz to our wedding venue, they were able to scope out the best spots for shoots so when the day of the wedding comes, we already have a plan of which spots to go to. Just look at the pic I uploaded...AMAZING! Super great to work with and will def use them for all of our photo needs. THANK YOU EDDIE and LIZ (and now Matthew and Paco!)<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIpMR8DoyJWEnuH78f84d1EqJ3Dsk3tGqarYZF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>{'time': 1579988261891, 'text': "Duuuuuuuude we always show off your photos to everyone who asks about weddings.

<review>I had a graduation photo session with Eddie and was super friendly and easy to work with. I was nervous about the session since it had been almost 10 years since my last professional photoshoot, but he made me feel super comfortable the entire time. He educated me and my mom throughout the whole session about lightning and poses. Originally I only wanted to do one location, but I'm so glad he convinced me to go to this recommended spot because the photos came out BEAUTIFUL. Can't recommend this small business enough, you will not regret it!<//review>< GmapID>

We loved our experience with Love Life Photography, from start to finish! Eddy was friendly and informative on the phone; I felt like I knew what I was getting into when we started (no hidden fees). The day of the shoot was great, he had everyone including my 9 month old son ALEX laughing and feeling comfortable. He paid attention to detail and helped us all feel relaxed. We love our photos and appreciate the memories made! Thank you to both Eddy and his wife, we will definitely be using your services again!</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I’ve never had my picture taken professional before so this was definitely an experience! I thought that there would be very little talking and much awkwardness, but it wasn’t like that at all! Eddie was super friendly and open to any input we had both individually and as a group! He made posing extremely easy and comfortable, I definitely didn’t have to fake a smile! Coming into the shoot I also thought that there would be much pressure on every frame that was taken since it was done with a professional camera, but Eddie can definitely work angles and details! Showing pictures after he took them was a huge plus and very much appreciate! I always like to look at picture right there on the spot to get an idea of what’s going on! Weather was against us for a bit but it worked out great in the end (:< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Love life photography was kind enough to fit my family photos in. He worked with me on a location that best suited my little family, I have children with special needs so finding the perfect location was extremely important. Eddie jumped right in and my two little ones felt at ease. There was 6 of us, in the park, he was able to move us around, had great ideas, and best of all he was super fast. Which means my kids are extremely quick to run away or move, but Eddie was faster and captured the most beautiful photos of my family. It’s been a super hard year and I feel exhausted. But Eddie captured the best parts of me and I couldn’t be more grateful! Love life photography is professional, kind, understanding, innovative, and most of all, just really creative. If you are looking for photos of any occasion and a reliable company, these are your people! Thanks again Eddie and Liz! Great job< /Review>

Liz and Eddie at Love Life Photography are not only great photographers, but genuine, down to earth people. They are so easy to work with and they make taking photos fun! You can tell they are passionate about their work and truly care about giving you the best photos possible. Liz has photographed some of the biggest moments in our life, including our pregnancy announcement and maternity photos, and now our annual family holiday photos. She always has creative ideas and does a great job of capturing those candid, genuine moments. She is also the sweetest person and so patient with the little ones. Even with my 18 month old daughter constantly wanting to run around, she made it fun for her and managed to capture the most beautiful photos, I could not have been happier. We will continue to go back to Liz and Eddie for all our family photography because they deliver amazing, high quality photos and are great people to work with. I would highly recommend them for any of your photographing needs!<//text>

Eddie and Liz have photographed our engagement, wedding, and our son’s first birthday. We have trusted them for our major milestones because they do an amazing job! They’re also great at making your kids laugh in case you’re worried that your little ones will be hard to photograph! They do a great job of making you feel comfortable in front of the camera. They also offer quick turnaround with high quality photos and editing! We will continue to use them and recommend them to everyone because of their amazing service. Thanks, Eddie and Liz!< /text>

<text>As with other weddings during the covid pandemic, we unfortunately had to postpone our big celebration. My now husband and I still wanted to get married on our original planned wedding date. We didn’t want covid to ruin our plans completely so we then decided to spontaneously have a small intimate wedding ceremony and reception with five of our family members and closest friends. Eddie was recommended to us by our venue, we contacted him the day before our wedding to see if he was available and booked Love Life Photography that same day to shoot our video and pictures. Eddie took his time to get to know us and listened to our preferences. Eddie and Liz are amazing. They both made us feel comfortable taking pictures and video. Their energy and enthusiasm are great, you can definitely tell they love what they do and care for their clients. What is even more amazing is that Eddie surprised us with our finished wedding video the next day and it turned out wonderfully. We definitely recommend Love Life Photography! They take amazing photography and video and are so fun to work with. Thank you again Eddie and Liz for capturing our special day. Although we didn’t have the wedding we had originally planned, because of Love Life Photography we can still share our special day with all our friends and family!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Words cannot express how happy my fiance and I were to be able to find and work with vendors like Eddie and Liz. My fiance proposed to me in La Jolla, San Diego by the beach and Eddie was so creative about capturing the moment on video so that all of our friends and family could relive the moment with us, even though they couldn't be there. Liz was also there, constantly taking photos of everything Eddie was getting on video. They both made us feel so comfortable during our shoot, telling us which angles would be the most flattering, how to get the best looking candid photos, doing multiple takes until we were happy with the photos/videos. And then when it came to editing, Eddie was SO on top of his game! He was able to turn around a rough cut of the engagement video in TWELVE hours!! and then patiently and meticulously worked through our edits within the next 72 hours. He also got all of our photos back to us in less than a week and they came out PERFECT. The two of them captured our love SO well and we could not be happier with the end products. Eddie and Liz will be our go-to photographer/videographer in San Diego forever. We could not have been more pleased.<//review>

We had our wedding during covid and during a weekend that had possible rain and he was incredibly accommodating to set up the photo shoot last minute. He was easy to communicate with and we loved the ideas he provided for the poses. He was also great at getting kids and toddlers in our wedding party to smile for the pictures.We will definitely continue to use Love Life Photography to capture memories for future life events.</Text><Name>Natalie Sanchez<//Name>< userid>

Im not normally one to do photo shoots but because this was my first pregnancy I really wanted a picture of me pregnant with my baby girl. Liz guided me through the whole experience and gave wonderful direction throughout the whole shoot. I didn’t feel like any of my positions were forced or awkward. The ease of the experience she gave me definitely showed in the end product. I have never felt so beautiful and excited to share these pictures with my husband and family. I will forever be thankful for this beautifully captured moment in time! Highly recommend Love Life Photography!<//text>< gmap_id>

Every year our family takes holiday photos. This was our first experience with Eddie and let me tell you...he was an absolute pleasure to work with. He made our family photoshoot a fun, comfortable and memorable experience. From the initial discussion of photoshoot location, to poses and scenery shots, all the way to selecting the photos we liked; Eddie took the time and listened to what we wanted and executed. I look forward to working with Eddie in the future!< /review>

<Text>I am a repeat customer, and a friend of Eddie’s for about 14 years.
Eddie’s talent behind the lens (IMO) is matched only by Time and Nat geo photographers.  Love Life Photography as a business is extremely competitive, and delivers an EXPERIENCE not just a photo shoot.  The energy level is a 14 on a scale of 1-10, which is very contagious during your time spent with Love Life Photography, and never a dull moment.
The quality of the photos is TOP SHELF and delivered in an extremely timely manner.  Our most recent photo shoot with Love Life Photography was Dec 2020 (during Covid struggles); Eddie was very professional with Socially distancing himself and well as wearing a face covering, as well as delivering a finished product swiftly given the current circumstances.
Highly recommended for your photo ahoot needs.< /Text>< Rating>

<Text>I recently had the opportunity to have a one on one class with Eddie to learn some basics about photography. I’ve had a DSLR for years and enjoy taking photos, however have never learned how to use the features of my camera to achieve the type of photos I want to take. Eddie pinpointed the kind of photography I’d like to focus on and the tools I’d need to use to achieve those shots. I walked away from our lesson feeling confident in my own knowledge and abilities. Could I have watched a YouTube video? Yes. Would I have learned the same amount of information? Absolutely not. Having that live feedback was invaluable in helping me troubleshoot my camera and giving me tips to work around my camera’s automatic set-up. I 110% recommend Eddie for all your photography needs. From behind the lens to helping you with yours, he has the talent, patience, and knowledge that you NEED to work with.</Text>< Pics>

I have watched countless videos on YouTube to learn photography and in 30 mins I have learned more than I have in hours of YouTube videos!

The best part about these lessons is that they can see where your are struggling and can address where you are going wrong get passed that challenge and on to the next! The other best part is that the record lessons so you can review and refresh as much as needed!

This was so amazing because I actually learned and motivated me to learn more gaining the confidence to keep on practicing instead of letting my camera collect dust!

Thanks Eddie you have a way with teaching what a gift!</text>

<review>I can't write enough to express how happy I am with the experience Love Life gave my now finance and me. We don't live in San Diego so all the planning had to be done remotely. Eddie was my man on the ground scoping out the venue, working with the venue management on various arrangements, and most importantly taking the load off of me and putting me at ease. Last thing to mention is the photo shoot. Eddie was professional, knew exactly what to do, was easy to work with, and made the whole experience completely enjoyable. We spent hours taking pictures into the wee hours of the morning. Eddie does exceptional work all the way around. Love Life Photography is 5 stars.< /review>< pics>

I recently hired love life photography for a business shoot for my business cards and social media platform however today I want to speak about my wedding/family portrait experience that we hired “love life photography “. I was a little nervous in the beginning because it would be a family photo with two small kids and my mom who never allows anyone to take pictures of her along with me and my husband and our 2 older children. I do not regret the choice we made because my mother had a great time and believe me it took a long time of begging to get her to say yes to the photo shoot 🙌🏼. Love life photography guided all of us through all of the poses, met us in several different spots of San Diego ranging from the courthouse to Coronado Shores. We all had so much fun and seeing my children laugh along with my mom I would do it again! The pictures came out amazing from the background to the poses and lighting. My sincere gratitude and thankfulness for taking the time and personalizing this family event. Thank you Love Life Photography!</Text>

My now fiance gave me the surprise of a life time! He had worked with Eddie in planning my dream surprise engagement, I had NO idea! After the initial surprise Eddie introduced him self to me. He made both of us feel comfortable while posing for pictures. He is the perfect combination of fun and professional to give you natural laughs for your pictures. I can never express how thankful I am for having such a special moment captured in such beautiful way!</Text>

<Text>I had an awesome experience with Love Life Photography. I had a photo shoot to display my Charger pride. At the beginning of the football season, I wanted something expressive and memorable. Eddie and Elizabeth were able to help me to capture exactly what I wanted. They are friendly and efficient. I'll be coming back to them for more business in the future. Thanks Love Life!!!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Had a great experience when I booked a session to catch my engagement on camera. Eddie was great helping with the planning and scouting of the location and throughout the shoot. Not to mention, we ended up with some great shots of one of the most important moments in our lives.< /Review>< pics>

I was referred to Eddie and Liz, by my sister about 2 years ago. Over the past two years, my husband and I, have hired Eddie for three photo sessions. One of my favorite sessions was our maternity photo session. The pictures are always beautiful, Eddie makes you feel comfortable and he's so passionate about photography. We will be using Eddie and Liz again soon.<//Text>

Eddie is an amazing & professional photographer for our new chiropractic office! He provided great ideas for marketing shots, head shots, team shots and he has great resources for videography. He is energetic, works great with kids & never fails to make you laugh and smile! We would recommend him to all our friends, families and patients for any of their photography needs!< /Text>

We were sent an email of suggestions on how to pick colors and details in our clothing that we would have never thought about if they didn't share it with us.

Eddie and Liz captured beautiful photos of my parents, their children and grandchildren. The session was fun and relaxing! No forced smiles, just natural beauty and happiness.

Highly recommend Love Life Photography (:</text>< pics>

<Review>I've worked with many awesome photographers in my career and personal life, but working with Eddie from @ilovelifephotography was definitely the best experience!!! His flexibility, creativity, and outstanding energy working with my daughter exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend him. His level of professionalism and prompt service to edit and provide our pictures in a quick timeframe was amazing! The pictures came out so good and my entire network couldn't agree any more. He is by far THE BEST photographed I've worked with.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

Right from the moment I met them until I saw all the pictures I was so impressed. Eddie jumped right into pictures of every moment of our wedding. We had a courthouse wedding and Eddie captured the perfect photos for us to have and cherish forever. You just knew right away that he loved his job through his passion and dedication to making it perfect through pictures for us. Eddie and Liz are amazing and our wedding party absolutely agreed with us. They just made it so comfortable for pictures and really connected with our love story to capture it better than we had ever imagined. The specifics that they shot with every photo magnificently shines with detail and dedication to helping us seize the perfect moments of our “I do’s.” Thank you a billion times Eddie and Liz.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1423699322543, 'text': "I still can't believe that we get to call this our job.

< Review>
My grandfather was turning 100 years old - talk about a once in a lifetime event! - and we needed a photographer to capture the festivities. We hired ilovelifephotogrpahy and hit the jackpot! People traveled from all over the United States and came from other countries to attend; we had one chance to get this right. Eddie and Liz were a perfect fit from the get-go.

They showed up a little early to each event and didn't miss a thing (we didn't have to worry or wonder if they were lost or going to be a no-show.) Their ideas for backdrop, posture, grouping and mood were perfect. They have a knack for making people feel comfortable, whether that be a 100 year old man, a middle-aged woman, or a small child. They dressed appropriately to each event and blended into our group. They seemed to know where to be to get the best shot and capture a special moment.

I have never trusted a photographer as much as I did Eddie and Liz. They seemed to want things to go smoothly and to celebrate my grandfather, and our family, as much as we did. It was nice to be able to let them handle those details and to be able to just enjoy the moment. I brought my personal camera, but I never felt like I needed to use it.

My faith was rewarded when they posted the photos. Not only were the photographs of excellent quality, their website was very user friendly. I downloaded some photos and orders others to be printed. The print quality was outstanding! Although Eddie and Liz aren't in my home, in a way, they are in nearly every room.

My only complaint is that they are based in California and I don't live there! If you can afford it, I'd recommend flying them out to where ever your event is being held. You will find their service and product well worth it.

Thank you so much Eddie and Liz for a job well done and for all of your kindness,
Bethany H.< /Review>

I had a terrific photo shoot with Love Life Photography! I did a track and field photoshoot and I had a blast shooting! All of the pictures looked like the pictures you would see in a Nike ad or a fitness magazine. I loved working with Eddie and Liz, they were easy to work with and we had a lot of fun. I cannot wait to do another fitness shoot with them. I highly recommend that you do a photoshoot with Love Life Photography!< /Text>

Loving Love Life Photography. Eddie is the owner of this company and I have had several photo shoots with him. He and his wife create a fun environment and helpful tips thoughout the shoots. If u r looking for someone who has creative ideas and a fun attitude this is the place. Eddie has  done photoshoots with me at different locations both indoor and outdoor all look great. He has great connections with hair and makeup if u want the full effect for your pics.<//review>

<date>1413862370907<//date><review>Best customer service experience I have received in a long time.  Very personable and attentive.  I love supporting small  businesses and appreciate the professionalism I have received from this husband and wife team.  They create a dynamic that makes you feel like you are a part of their extended family.  I have used Love Life Photography (LLP) for kids photo sessions. We all know kids don't always cooperate however, both Eddie and Liz showed great patience with them.  I definitely will be using LLP in the future.  Prior to using them I would buy Groupons for photo sessions for Target, JC Penny, Picture People etc none of them come close to creating a memorable experience beyond the actual picture the way LLP does.  I now know that photo sessions themselves are also a part of the memory in addition to the photo that you hang on the wall.  I like the idea that Eddie and Liz will capture my kids as the grow up. And I as well will have the opportunity to watch their bushiness grow because I will be referring  everyone I know :)< /review>< user>

Entrance to this station from Highway 120/Jackson Avenue is a 'hidden' side entrance, or from Escalon-Bellota Rd sandwiched between two stoplights so it becomes rather clogged with traffic. This station does not accept credit cards, only cash or debit. I also discovered they charge a 'service fee' for using the debit card as well. So, buyer beware- the service fee makes their prices equal to or higher than the Kwik Serve on the East end of town.< /Review>

<Review>Great Chinese food! Quite spicy so please ask for non spicy if you cannot eat spicy food. The staff is helpful but they are not very good at English so may have some difficulties in communication<//Review>< Pictures>

Scrumptious dishes! The staff was kind, I personally liked the numbering of dishes but my partner was fine just ordering in Chinese and said it was even better than many meals he's had in this region of China. The only thing that was left afterwards was the flavorful sauce and the staff were very accommodating when my partner's mom asked to have it to go. Though I love spicy food, I personally struggled with all those peppercorns and oil but my partner says those are authentic Hunan ingredients so it's not for the faint of heart</Text>

This is my usual lunch place. Very good and tasty food. There service is quick as well. #105, #109 are my favorites. My friend who usually eats with me loves their sizzling chicken with basil. Here is my friend enjoying his lunch.</Review>

Food is delicious. The waiters are very polite and friendly. The restaurant is clean and organized. This is a good place to stop after work to watch a game, eat,  and get a beer. I am sure, you will enjoy it.</text>

I lived in Hunan for many years.  This place was like coming home.  They had food I have been searching for years for.  I can't describe how happy I was eating authentic Hunan food again.  This is the best Chinese food I have eaten since I lived in China.

Also, the staff were gracious and kind.  They were very helpful and went out of their way to help get us the food we wanted.  Thanks especially to the young man who helped me find the dish I haven't eaten for years.

Eat here for real Chinese food.  You won't regret it.<//text>

Authentic Hunan food at reasonable prices. Fast take out service when calling in my lunch orders.  This food tastes just like the food I had in Changsha, Hunan in 2017.</Review>

What a horrible experience! I showed up to an empty restaurant at lunchtime hoping to have a working lunch. When the woman tried to seat me at a tiny two-person table, I asked if I could sit at a four-top because I had my computer.

The woman became quite rude and demanded I sit at a two-top because the busy lunch hour (they were empty; it was after 12pm). Fine, whatever, so I at down, pull out my computer, then review and place my order from the lunch menu. She walks away.

About five minutes later she comes up to confirm I ordered from the lunch menu (yes). Then she tells me “under $20, you pay cash.” I let her know I didn’t have cash (I never carry it). She then yells at me “NO! Go down the way and withdraw cash.” Um, what? Please don’t yell at me. I let her know I also didn’t have an ATM/debit card, and expected to pay card as indicated on their storefront. She again screamed at me “NO!” So, I left and went next door to Neuve.

Atrocious attitude. Bad business practices.<//text>

<Text>Very impressive! My friend originally from Chongqing recommended this place, and as a spicy food lover, we found this place is very authentic. We usually have to go all the way to the union city/Fremont/Hayward to get authentic Hunan / Szechuan food, now we found this place, and we are so glad that peninsula finally got something great<//Text><username>Huilin Dai</username></record></dataset><record>

New addition to the neighbor. Full of devious spiced spicy food! First try was great experience and tasty! Will come back again :) it’s at salty side to my taste. Nothing bad, I just don’t eat much salty stuff. Next time I will ask for less salt.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x808f79ca74e27bc3:0x22761dca26a73e0e</Gmap_id><text>This place is a joke. It doesn't even deserve the one star. Not only are the prices outrageous but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. I called for a to go order - simple veggie fried rice and honey walnut shrimp (which I ordered previously a month ago - it was alright). The guy ringing me up looked irritated when I simple asked to confirm my order. I pay the $30 for these two entrées and leave. I get home and see that my order is wrong, the receipt in the bag says prawns with honey black pepper sauce. Head back to the restaurant hoping this is just a mix up - nope. The guy who rung me up and another staff member argued with me about the order. Trying to convince me that this is honey walnut shrimp and to just leave. After a few more moments of arguing with me, I just ask for a refund of my money because at this point I'm so done with the horrible service I just experienced. The lady tells me she can't because the boss isn't there and to just order something else. I firmly tell her my disappointment with this establishment and do not want anything else - I just want my money back. She walks away yelling into the back and finally the guy who rung me up says he can do the refund and snatches my credit card from my hand. Got my refund and left.

To think this replaced Au's Kitchen - what a major disappointment. Save yourself the trouble and spend your money somewhere else.< /text>< pictures>

I visted this place for dinner and the appearance of the restaurant seemed nice so i was intrigued. I ordered rice, chow mein and some orange chicken. The chicken had a bizzare and unusual flavor. I asked for a replacement and as i recived it i sppotted a man in the back looking at me and a friend as our nee plate was being delivered. They replaced it with beef and broccoli and it was super salty. I procceded to ask for water and to my surpise i had warm room temperature water with a funny taste whilst the table next to be had a nice cold glass. I had enough at that point and was very displeased.i would never recommend this place, i preferred the old restaurant that was there. What a waste of time and money, also not to metion how over priced the food was.after everything i was charged almost $45 for low quality horrible tasting food.</text>

(Translated by Google) A restaurant with a beautiful environment, rich dishes and great taste! ! Every detail is very good, beautiful cups with music flowers. I have been there many times with my husband, and every time I order the couple's lung slices, beef beef with white pepper and pork belly with dried beans. The wife is delicious, and the proprietress is also very nice. The ingredients are very fresh, and it is a restaurant not to be missed!

环境优美，菜品丰富，味道一级棒的餐厅！！每个细节都很好，音乐鲜花漂亮的杯子。和老公来了很多次，每一次都会点夫妻肺片，白辣椒肥牛还有干豆角五花肉。太太太好吃了，老板娘也很好人。菜品吃的出食材很新鲜，是一家不容错过的餐厅！</Text>

(Translated by Google) I have been eating for two consecutive days, and I have opened dozens of kilometers the next day. It is a great place for a Hunanese shop! The taste is super authentic, can be served in Chinese, to eat spicy, remember to let the waiter and the kitchen say that according to the standards of Hunan fellow, the taste is completely different.

连续来吃了二天，第二天开了几十公里来，做为一个湖南人这家店太赞了！口味超正宗，可以中文服务，要吃辣的记得让服务生和厨房说按湖南老乡的标准炒，味道完全不一样。< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I often taste this new dish with this restaurant. They can not only achieve the supremacy. The service is fantastic. In particular, the boss is very enthusiastic to greet the customers, and also introduces the guests to their prepared special dishes. There are also a variety of wines available to facilitate customers. Ready to open Happy hours. The boss and the staff are top. Hey, I give them praise and praise.

Great Service. They told me an hr wait..it was more like 40 min. & worth the wait. They we're very professional, efficient and price was very reasonable considering my situation so early in the morning. Thanks again Mike.<//Review>

I wish i could give this place ZERO stars!!! The employees of this company stole both my fiancé's engagement ring and wedding ring, as well as my wedding ring. As if that wasn't terrible enough.. Any time i tried to ask anyone anything about the rings, they were all just completely rude and deceiving. I truly thought this sort of thing wouldn't happen in this type of business but unfortunately i was incorrect.< /review>

Car broke down last night. And they were able to come pick me and my car up for a reasonably good price at about 2am. They were kind and considerate. They also got me as close to my destination as the possibly could. Thanks for picking me up when know one else would.</Review>

I drove a friend to pick up their vehicle and some hag who wasn't even at the front desk came out to stare down another female passenger I had which starts a verbal fight. WTF! I don't need that kind of stress!<//Review>

Horrible towing company, if you ever have to go there just be prepared for rude workers. And your car will not be the same condition they towed it in, they may even change your lock to your car just overall bad company.<//Text>

Terrible experience. My car was towed to this location after I was in a car accident. I called ahead of time to verify that my car is at that location. I told them I would be there in less than 20 minutes. I had trouble locating their tow yard and call the office again. The lady tells me that she doesn't know how to tell me and that I should just drive around and look for a sign. Then goes to say it doesn't matter because they were closing. It would've been helpful if they told me they were closing when I told them I was less than 20 minutes away. I try going again the next day. I told the lady at front desk that I only wanted to get my belongings that were in my car because my insurance was going to get it towed to their facilities so they can calculate the damages. I brought my brothers with me to help since I have a broken arm. She tells me that only I can get the things out because only my name is under the vehicle information. So there I am struggling to get my belongings and the employees didn't even offer to help me. They just told me to hurry it up because they had to move my car to get to another car. No compassion what so ever.< /Review>

Someone hit my car on the 215S and the police called this company to tow it to clear the road, I was told they had to tow it even though it was drive able. When we get to the tow yard I'm told I have to pay $440 +$50+$100 in fees when the car was there less than two hours. Crooks!!! They had no compassion or care that the car was only there a few hours, I don't have $590 just laying around, disgusting business practices...</review>

< Review>
WORST TOWING EXPERIENCE EVER. My mothers car was towed here after she was hospitalized after a major car accident. The old and bitter lady that answered the phone was extremely rude to us. The first time I called she answered the phone and simply set the phone aside for several minutes then finally answered.  I needed to get some stuff out of my car because it was deemed a total loss and would need to be towed to my insurance company to keep so I asked her what I needed to access my car and she said as long as you are the registered owner, which I am! When I arrived at the tow yard she told me that I needed my registration which I had just called and she did not say that!  I had to drive back to my house which of course they did not compensate! Worst experience ever. AVOID AVOID AVOID</Review>

This place sucks. The only business they probably get is from the poloce department. My car was impounded and had a 30 day hold on it. After speaking to the police station, they said it wasn't a 30 day hold. I  called in to ask what the fees were the lasy I spoke with had an attitude. "YOU GUYS JUST CALLED ABOUT THIS ITS A 30 DAY HOLD." I said, "No it's not, I will get the release today. How much are my fees? She said, "286, get here before 5pm if you get here at 5:10 its another day." I arrived at 4:32pm. Chelsea some young  girl who hated her job (I dont even know why she works there) was like can I help you? With a straight face, an attitude and raised eyebrow, I said om here to pick up my car. She handed me the clipboard and asked me to sign. I said "Wait, im not signing this until I see the condition of my car." (The paper I was to sign was in relation to that.) She acted as if I was the only customer who wanted to make sure there are no damages before signing. I got my car and from my backpack, it was missing $200 worth of things. They charged me extra despite the signs and speaking the the lady in the morning. I asked, "What's the extra charge for?" She said cleaning. I said "what cleaning?" Do you have a breakdown of these fees?" She said "Sign and I'll show it to you." I NEVER GOT A BREAKDOWN OF WHY I WAS CHARGED EXTRA. I asked to talk to a manager she said no one was there
i asked if she can get one on the phone she said No. Then an old lady like in her 60s or 70s was sitting in an older van outside and they were like she's the one you spoke to. I said I just asked if they were here you said no since I failed to get her name. She said you don't have to sign if you don't want to. I said fine om not they wouldnt release my keys so I signed and wrote alll over ny receipt that I do not agree to any of these charges. Come to find out, the charged me extra because they said our driver took extra on this trip.. uhhhhh so what does that have to do with me??????? He could have went to lunch, hung out to get paid more nothing was noted. I looked at the time he arrived it was 5:19pm the time he returned was at 6:16pm. It was less than an hour and car was 9 miles away. This place is trash< /Review>

<Review>The staff is extremely rude. I speak only for the ones working in the office, as I have never had any interaction with a driver.  It's seems the office staff tends to take their own personal issues to work, and takes them out on their clients. I was verbally assaulted by the woman at the front desk, and sent away because she said I "chuckled" when she was speaking. Customer service at this location is severely lacking.<//Review>< pics>

I got my car stolen, when they called me to tell me they found it and I could pick it up, i was in walnut getting my tire replaced at 2am because it fell apart. So i couldnt make it on time and it ended up in this place. So annoying. Then i call today at 11am... 11Am!!! I asked if i can pick up paperwork from thr vehicle she said yes.. I get herr and she said you habe to come back because no one is here. They are all at lunch. The lady couldnt tell me that over the phone? She was just that busy checking cars in?
It disgusts me. I cant believe i have to give these people that allow this kind of service money i dont have!!!</Text>< response>

When I went there to pay and get my car out there was porn playing on the tv and the woman and man were just there watching it. I was disgusted with them. They didn't have the audacity to even shut it off, just mute it. so unprofessional.</Text>

I'd give this place 6 stars if I could!! I’m constantly shocked at how absolutely delicious the dishes are and very consistent in freshness and potion-size (which is huge). The quality is amazing and I think the takeout containers are biodegradable (but I could be wrong). The differ from the typical black plastic anyhow.< /Review>

Very neat and convenient restaurant. They offer big meals and for inexpensive rates. I loved the menu very much and the staff members were super friendly and chatty. I recommend this place.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>It's been at least six years since I last had a meal here and it was as great a meal as I remember! My son just moved to NorCal today and we got to enjoy deep-fried pork belly with Chinese broccoli and chicken praram rice dishes, which we ate next to our car hood while parked along the side of the street at the foot of the UC Berkeley campus. It was an inelegant way of eating a tasty meal but one we'll both remember for many, many years!<//Review>< Pictures>

First time here and it blew my mind! All the flavors were incredible. Food was fresh. Everything came out at the perfect temperature and within a reasonable amount of time. Service was great and quick. The ginger tea was to die for (I got 3 cups). We did family style. Soup was huge! Easily split between 2 people. Overall fantastic experience!! It’s my new favorite Thai food spot.< /review>

Fantastic food. Usually very busy, but absolutely worth the wait. I got the pad kee mao and it was great. Very good level of spice, and everything in it was cooked at the right level. The Thai tea was also particularly good Thai tea. I have eaten Thai food in Thailand and I think this place is fantastic. I intend to go back.<//review>

A local spot with some good Thai food, Imm Thai was perfect for a quick lunch!

I stopped by right after they opened and was seated immediately. I ordered the Pad Thai dish (which was very reasonably priced at just $10) and received my food in minutes. Though the portion size was large, the dish did feel a bit bland.</Review>

This place is hustling and bustling all day long. The service is fast and friendly, the food is delicious and generously portioned. The spicy dishes here are spicy! The Thai tea was awesome and the kids love the Pad  Se Ew. They even had gluten free options for my wife. The prices are very reasonable. Definitely a place to come back to.</Review>

Bathrooms were unisex, very clean and smelt good. Environment was casual, nice, trendy, clean. Prices, everything was pretty much  around ten bucks.  Parking was hard to get.   Food was okay,  the main parts of the plates like the meat and vegetables were really bland and low quality, what kept the food good is the spices and sauces. Quality of meat was way lame.  I did have this place with 5 stars, then I ate, and I have had much better thai food.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>This is the best Thai food I have had in quite some time.
The green curry is one of my favorites, along with Pad Kee Mao for those who favor spice. Their Thai iced coffee is a good complement to the noodles or curry.</Review>< Pictures>

I do not say it lightly when I say Imm Thai is legitimately the best Thai food I've had in the Bay Area. They take about 10-15 mins to serve but all their menu items are outstanding, from the Yellow Curry to the Pad See Ew or Pad Kee Maw. Their spring rolls are super healthy and tasty. They do good substitutions for vegetarians. My friends were in love with their Duck orders.

<text>I think that this is VERY good Thai food. The food and the ambience were amazing, and even though I was on the wrong side of it, I support fact that you had to wait in line and that ALL members had to be present to get seated. The food was very fresh, spicy, and delicious. Try their Pad see yoo(Flat rice noodles) and their green curry, as those were the best items my group got(not shown below)But the other food was still flavourful and zingy . My only complaint would be the price, as the portion sizes are pretty small, but the food itself makes up for it. Everything from the modern-feeling environment to the food is great!< /text>< pictures>

Cool Thai venue with a rustic street kitchen feel (drinks in metal cups 😄), delicious food at very good prices. Reservation system consists of a paper list hanging by the door where you write your name.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Really solid Thai place in Berkeley. Fast service and good food! It can get really crowded for dinner on weekends so come before the rush (before 6pm).

Their Tom Yum soup is delicious! The bowl was filled with so much chicken (you can choose to get tofu or chicken). Since they use white meat, the chicken was a little dry, but other than that, soup is perfect!

Tried their duck rice plate. The duck was really tender and drenched in sauce. I wish they put a little less sauce because the sauce itself was overpowering and salty, but if you eat the duck and rice together it was fine.

Pad kee mao is flavorful and just the right amount of spiciness to it! Filled with veggies and lots of noodles, this was my favorite dish of the night!

Excited to come back and try more dishes (although finding parking is such a pain because well... it's Berkeley).< /text>< pictures>

Good food! Fresh, flavorful, good portion and reasonably priced. Appetizers $6-7, entre $9.5- 11.

<Time>1510692753542<//Time><rating>4</rating><text>Reviewing for a ToGo experience: easy to call in (challenging to find a reliable menu online), food was made fast and payment was easy. For the record: ordering to go is never the same experience as eating in- the food can suffer and the presentation can foul your appetite. Finding a restaurant that can still keep that charm between ToGo and Eating-In are far and few in-between. Imm Thai has nailed my ToGo expectations. The food is a clear 4/4 stars! Definitely one of the best Thai food menus around downtown Berkeley. The Drunken Noodles were perfect level of heat that woos you in for more but doesn’t leave your mouth regretting it. With thin slices of chicken with fried tofu, the dish wasn’t oily or skimpy on the toppings. Green beans were cooked nicely with a slight blistering of char. Portions are about right for the price tag. Would recommend this place to anyone.< /text>< pictures>

I used to go there because the food was pretty good. I bought today for to go, and the food was really BAD, the chicken was burned and over cook and taste a lot of garlic, the fried rice  was spoiled and the ribs were greasy and under cook.  I’m really disappointed</text>

This is a small place, but the food and quick service makes it worth! Especially impressed with the tea/ coffee drinks. We ordered Pad Thai & Duck over Rice. Both of them were well made. Not the best Thai food I have had, but definitely good food :)</text>

Really enjoyed this Thai place, despite the fact that my son's girlfriend suggested it.  I had the spicy beef salad.  Real strong after kick -- just the way I like it.  Be careful not to let any food touch the outside of your lips if you have the commitment to order this dish.  I will definitely come back here again.  My son has at least 3 years left to graduate.</review>

Best Thai food in the Bay. Be ready to wait as there is usually a line, but definitely worth the wait as the food and service are fantastic. Prices are very reasonable and portions big enough to share. It is one of our must-visit restaurants when in Berkeley.</Text>

Standard Thai fare (pumpkin curry with brown rice was on point). Duck noodle soup was too salty. Mango sticky rice was too sweet.< /Text>

Can’t go wrong with this place. Their curries, noodle dishes are all great, and their shrimp is very tasty if you choose to add it (rather than the usual chicken). The flavors are super authentic and portions are good too!<//Review>

<text>My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on date night. He got the sweet chicken and I got a beef dish. I don't remember how to spell the name of it but it was really good. We both devoured our food. They were pretty busy but they were able to seat us at the bar. We had a full on view of the kitchen which I was a little surprised but it was clean. It can get a little loud in there but this place is definitely worth it. I'll be back!</text>< Pictures>

Decent food but very over rated. There are better places right here in Berkeley. Imm thai has too much sugar and sauces. Flavors are made for American tastes and not authentic. Somehow this place has become trendy so it's always crowded which begets more crowds, but not because the food is exceptional. People think they're recreating sitting on a stool in Thailand and having a deep cultural experience by going here, when in fact most Thai people would not eat at Imm Thai and the prices are 1000% what they cost in Thailand.<//Text>

I enjoyed the roti appetizer with yellow curry.
Pretty much what you could expect in Malaysia or Singapore (not so much a Thai dish).  I tried the pumpkin curry withe chicken for my main course.  Great flavor, wonderful spice level, just a bummer that the pumpkin was not cooked enough and it was too firm in texture. Kind of like eating a potato not cooked enough.  I would definitely return, just wouldn't order the pumpkin curry again.</Text><response>None<//response>< user_name>

<Review>I love the food here. Roti prata, spring roll, soup, pad Thai are delicious. I love their non alcoholic beverages too. The place is always packed so ready to be waiting in a queue for a while. Only qualm, sometimes the staff is not the most friendly or attentive :(<//Review>< Name>

One of my favorite places to get Thai food around Berkeley. It's cheap and the food is great. I would recommend getting the drunken pad see ew if you are okay with spicy food because I think it's personally one of the best items on their menu. The one downside is that this place is very popular and the wait time is usually pretty long unless you go right when they open.< /text>

Excellent food for a pretty good price point. Can't go wrong when ordering and many of the dishes taste quite authentic. Be wary if coming during peak hours (especially on the weekends) as you frequently have to wait up to 30 minutes.< /Review>

<review>The food wasn't tasty and pretty salty. The curry came with white rice which was gummy / gluey, wet, and overcooked. Asked the waiter for advice and ordered two salads, the first and the last (herb) and they were very similar. The noodle dish was nothing special. Really loud. There was a 40 minute wait to be seated.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Really tasty, and decent prices for the portions. They'll make the food less spicy for you if you ask. A meal here will run you about $14-$16 depending on the entree.</text>

<Review>This is one of my favorite thai places ever. Their Tom yum is super good. I also love their pad thai and green curry. I would recommend chicken or tofu or seafood for your menu options because sometimes, the beef tastes not fresh, like you can tell by the taste that it has been frozen. It gets really busy, so I would recommend coming at off hours<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I order take out from this place way too often, one of the best Thai places in Berkeley. Also a nice sitting environment inside for parties of two! Favorite dish is the spicy friend rice, cant go wrong. the service is always great, but may require wait for 10 to 20 minutes to dine in if you go during peak hours.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< user>

Probably the best Thai food in the bay! Their pad see ew is the best I've had outside of Thailand, and everything else we've tried has been delicious as well. Can't go wrong with any of the staples, so trust your gut and order what you usually get at other Thai restaurants and just get ready to have an amazing meal.

It gets crowded at lunch and dinner times so be prepared to wait a bit. Most of the tables are small, so if you go with a larger group (i.e. more than 3), you might get a little frustrated watching a bunch of two tops getting seated before you. But persevere and you'll enjoy some amazing Thai food at super reasonable prices.< /Text>

After this place I love love love Thai food!  I work near here so I eat here at least once a week if not more!  My favorites you ask?  I love the spicy eggplant with chicken or tofu.  The Suki Noodle soup is HELLA bomb!  So much so I dream about it.  Their curries are normal - but all so good.  Pad see ew is good, pad Thai is good.

Even with the multitude of options available in Berkeley for Thai Food (I've probably tried like 5-6 places near the University), Imm Thai stands out as one of the best. The prices are typical- in the $11+ range, and the food is quite good.<//Text>

It's conveniently just blocks from Downtown Berkeley BART so it's an easy spot to meet up with friends from other parts of the bay. I tried the spicy eggplant with tofu as well as the pumpkin curry with chicken and loved them both. The brown rice was excellent and both dishes had just the right amount of spice.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Chris Garnica< /name>< Time>

<Text>Good prices!
Great vegetarian options!
Good location, except parking was a little hard to come by, we ended up walking a lot.
I'd suggest getting there by uber/lyft/public transport.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBJCqu2H8qoF29XinvIbipQQtj5dN6-Gv9z1gq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

The food was spicy, and the crispy tofu was great. They never bothered the stop by once after serving, not even to refill my water. As a result, I left thirsty. The atmosphere was casual and upbeat.< /text>

The rating is for the food.

I visited this place on a Monday evening a of week ago. Super packed but managed to get a table relatively quickly (15-20 minutes wait). Delicious food, service was only 'okay' due to the number of people. I can't fault them for that, and would have to re-visit during a less busy time to rate the service.

Frankly, one of the best intro's I've had to a Thai restaurant. Everything - and I mean everything - that we as a group tried there was good.
Tom Yum soup (vegan style): 10/10
Pad see ew (w/chicken): 10/10
Fried rolls (Vegan): 10/10
Basil (w/chicken): 8/10 (Note: I don't like green beans, but even I admit this was great)
Red Curry (vegan): 10/10 - sweetly spicy heat that really creeps up on you in a good way.
The Hot Ginger tea was fantastic as well.

Try this place, you won't regret it if you like Thai food.<//Text>

The best Thai food in town! Their beef pad see ew is phenomenal, likewise any of their curries. Their pad kee mao and pad thai are nothing special in my opinion, but that doesn't matter. Also get a mango sticky rice!<//Text>

<text>Sometimes great food...

I go here at least once a week and get the same dish every time. Sometimes it's on point and I love it! But other times it just tastes like something's missing (too much chilly flakes, not savory enough, or whatever else it might be). So even though I like their food, I don't like it every time.< /text></record>

The food is amazing! Coming from DC and having lived in Tampa, this is the best thai food we've ever had. The beef noodle soup was transcendent! I had the pad Thai, which was also amazing and my husband had the red curry, which he said was the best he'd ever had. So happy we stumbled in here!!<//review>

Run of the mill Thai food. If you like the combination of sweet sour salty and spicy that make thai food, you'll get it here. I don't think the cooking is particularly inspired.</review>

< Review>
Best kind of Thai place. The kitchen is slammed, the wait staff is stretched thin, but the food is fantastic. I recommend the spicy eggplant and the braised pork. Both are so flavourful, and the rice soaks up all the delicious juices. It's also super hot and fresh because they're turning out a ton of volume. My favorite detail is the little tray of picked chilies and chili paste. It was so good. Seemed homemade.

Like I said though, the staff is stretched thin (went on Sunday at dinner). We had someone bring food to our table, and just as I was about to dig in, a different waiter swooped in and took it, telling us it was for someone else. Then they never brought is our drinks, and they were impossible to flag down. It wasn't rude or anything. It just seemed like they were way over worked.

Oh, and on your way in there's actually a sign up sheet behind you, but it looks like people are queued up because the line for take out is right there too. We saw at least four parties make the same mistake as we did; just waiting around for a while before someone would come tell them they had to sign up.</Review>

Yummy thai food that just hit the spot! Popoular cozy place...so be prepared to wait ..but worth the wait...if i had the option, would rate it 4.5 (hear, hear Google!) Food is on the spicier side...there's a spice rating for each dish...most dishes can be customized to be vegetarian...i had the pumpkin curry...that was delicious...definitely plan to visit again next time I'm in Berkeley< /review>

Warning if you are a person of color or African American please do not support this restaurant. Today (5/27/18) my husband entered this restaurant for the first time and was rudely greeted. This waitress refused to smile and she was very blunt when taking my husband’s order.  However, shortly after this same waitress was friendly and smiled an European Customer and his friends. Supporting this restaurant is like supporting hatred and racism.

Please do not support this restaurant!!!< /Text>

Lived in Thailand a long time and this is the closest to the Thai food is ate every day while I was there. Not fancy, not counter service, just fast and good.</Review>

Usually the food here is so good but on my last visit it was pretty bad. For example, the Tom Kha soup was mild to the point of flavorless and didn't have the vegetables usually found in this dish. Maybe it was just the chef on this particular day, but the food was really disappointing. Not sure if I'll be back.< /text>

Being on a budget and craving Thai food, a friend and I decided to try Imm Thai since it looked like a broke-college-student-kind-of-budget place to eat. We get there and it's packed for a tiny place; however we were seated right away. We order a plate of wings ($7), a soup ($5), Thai tea ($2.50 each), and we both ordered pad Thai (mine was $8 while my friend's was $12 since she requested tofu, shrimp, and chicken). We first received our wings which was 6 small wings (a little over a dollar each wing) and then we get the soup which was something out of my comfort zone but my friend liked it so I guess it was good. The wings were crispy and drenched in some zing-kind-of sauce. Our teas came which came in 12oz mason jars; it was real Thai leaves they brewed so I gave them that.

The pad Thais came out and it was a lot, and I think it was a lot because after eating the wings and soup I started to become full. The pad Thai was hot, indicator it was made to order, and when I ate it I noticed it tasted almost as good as a place which was completely cheaper. Our waitress was patient and filled up my water cup every time it was low. The service was nice but when the check came out to $40 between the both of us and my friend nearly paid $30 (including tip) it was not a street-food kind of price. Since we split the check I paid $16 (excluding tip) and for one person that was expensive. Yes we ordered what seemed like a lot of food but it wasn't. The soup was small for the expense as well as the wings.

We learned our lesson that Imm Thai Street Food will break the bank. There are of course many other places in Berkeley that will not break the bank. This place can be worth trying but take caution and make sure there's money in your bank account before you proceed. Happy eating!! ^^<//Text>

Great food, good service, they are patient with people new to eating Thai food. Mostly made not as hot as normally Thai food is made.  They will provide you with hot sauce, etc.. or cook it as normally cooked for Thai people.<//review>

<Review>Vegetarian review: hands down the best and most authentic Thai food I've been to in the Bay area. A bit cramped and you may wait a bit in evenings, but it's completely worth the wait.

Tasty and cheap food in a casual, but nice looking setting. The place is almost always busy, but service is rather fast. Not every item on the menu is healthy looking, but going there once in a while seems fine. Portions are generous.< /Review>

Okay so the food is alright, albeit inconsistent, with the same spice level having varying tastes day to day, similarly for other ingredients. Once I ordered the honey roasted duck and it was so salty it was nearly inedible! But the service is on another level. It took the servers thirty minutes for them to realize they forgot to put in my order. And they didn't even acknowledge they forgot it, they just came over with the menu and asked me "what did you order again?"</Text>

The place is kind of cramp, but if that reduces the wait, I can deal with it.

The menu had everything I wanted to taste, ended up with two noodle dish, wanted the poa ki mow, but they ran out of thick noodles but we settle for the thin one, which still tasted delicious.

The Thai coffee was good, the atmosphere was great, they have two big TV showing the game.

Overall, would come back if I'm feeling Thai.< /review>< Pictures>

Must I really give a reason why. The food is expensive, HELLA expensive and let's not even talk about the wait. The portion size is for a child not even a grown adult. It's really pitiful they serve you this size. The food taste  is bland and honestly you could get better in L.A. Call this ranting but 'nough said!</text>

Phenomenal! I ordered the mixed vegetable and it sported the most complex flavor I've ever experienced in this dish. It was as savory as meat but with a tiny hint of sweetness. My fiancée got the vegetarian suki soup, which was also thoroughly interesting. And for only $8 each, this is one of the best values in Berkeley. See you soon, Imm.< /review>

Sometimes it's really good, sometimes it's so sweet my teeth hurt, but hey, at least it's to loud to have a conversation, and too crowded to for real chairs. The tin cup for water is kind of cute, and I still go time to time, but I always am reminded why it's been a while when I do.< /review>

<Review>I have to preface this by saying that the  flavors were there and the servers were friendly & patient, but there were many drawbacks to our experience. Firstly, it was so loud we almost left as soon as we were seated. A small amount of acoustic treatment would go a long way here. Even though it was before 7pm, they were out of a number of the appetizers. The "starter" we did end up ordering didn't end up coming out til after we had finished eating the rest and gotten the check, and to add insult to injury it arrived without the requested peanut sauce (which we were charged for). It took 40 minutes to get our first dish (they brought out our entrees about ten minutes apart, super awkward) so the whole experience took over an hour even though we asked for a box & the check the moment the second entree hit the table. We saw "Thai street food" and figured we'd grab a quick curry & noodles, boy were we wrong. I'll give them one more try some other time when I'm not starving and short on time because it was tasty and the servers were nice.</Review>< resp>

Overhyped. Food is definitely good, but theres always an hour wait around dinner, which is not worth it considering theres other thai places just as good near there.</text>

One of the worst Pad Thai ever had. Noodles are melt into pieces, and way too sweet.</Text>

The prices are a little high for the food, but it's a nice hipster-ish location.</Text>

This is the best thai in Berkeley.  I love Thai and I've lived in Berkeley most of my life.  I've been to every Thai restaurant in Berkeley and IMM is the BEST!  Don't get me wrong there are lots of other great Thai places but for the cost and the taste you won't get better.  The Kana Mo Krab is fabulous.< /review>

Decent Thai food. Wasn't the most amazing as it should have been given the price, but was still pretty tasty. There's a lot of Thai places around though so it's hard to do well around Berkeley in this category.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Not bad a Thai restaurant
Today, chicken wings, chicken skewers, green curry, Tom Yum Goong
Chicken wings are salty and sweet and crispy (just feel too dry, seasoning is good)
The chicken skewers taste like a satay, and the chicken tastes good~ it’s pretty, it’s salty and sweet.
The green curry tastes delicious and the meal is first class! Positive
Tom Yum Kung soup is not lost, too acidic ~ but enough!
The amount here is not big, I really like this weight! After all, many restaurants in the United States are too big in food. I often can't finish it, and it's not so delicious to pack it back! And here are small small servings, not wasted after eating ~ just the table inside the store is really small 😂😂
The dishes here are not trampled today, and I waited a little while dining.

(Original)
還不錯的一間泰式餐館
今天點了、雞翅、雞肉串、綠咖喱、冬陰功
雞翅是鹹鹹甜甜的脆口口感（只是感覺太過乾了，調味是不錯的）
雞肉串吃起來感覺像沙爹，雞肉口感不錯～蠻推存的，也是鹹鹹甜甜的。
綠咖喱味道香濃，送飯一流！正吖🤩
冬陰功湯就不過不失，偏酸～但料足！
這裡的份量都不大，我很喜歡這樣的份量！畢竟美國很多餐館食物份量都太大了，我經常吃不完，打包回去又沒那麼好吃了！而這裡都小盤小份量，吃完不浪費～只是店內桌子也真的蠻小的😂😂
這裡的菜色今天都沒踩雷，來用餐的時候稍微等了一下下～< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Duck noodle soup, soup head is very rich and fragrant, slightly sweeter, duck meat is also tender, overall is not bad.
Thai fried noodles, a little too dry, a few drops of sauce also need to be better, just eat the mouth is not bad, but compared with the taste in Thailand is almost sweet, more sweet, more suitable for foreigners!
There are a lot of people, the table rate is actually very fast, the location is relatively small and crowded, if you have the opportunity to try other dishes next time!

鴨湯麵，湯頭蠻濃郁香，稍微偏甜了些，鴨肉也滿嫩，總體來說還不錯。
泰式炒麵，稍微太乾，多幾滴醬汁也需還可以好點，剛吃ㄧ口還不錯，但跟在泰國比起味道還是差點，偏甜了些，比較適合老外的口味了！
人很多，翻桌率其實也挺快，位置比較小擁擠了些，如果下次有機會還是會試試其他料理的！</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbgTlnPCc-y6VVI_VhwcduNfaPXwQ8KEU09JWB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdTmnJq7C3N5QyqVXH60C18CaaerASlGDhamXx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRWl1ZJcMrwkacqNwn8jn4fBzP4oL54AJscVut=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1B7d69egF-E80rkIeO6jsPcfQLxEhRx6Uwd8i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) It's cheap and delicious. I always ask for a different menu, but I've never missed it. Since the store is new, the inside is clean and comfortable. If you miss Asian food in Berkeley, this is a good place to go.
