Amazing place to get a haircut for adult and kid. For years I had been going somewhere else and when I was no longer able to go to my usual place it took me a while to find a place to cut my hair and my one year old. I found then on Instagram and tried them out before taking my one year old. I booked an appointment with Victor and was happy with his work. A week later I took my kid and he was better than I expected. Not only did he cut his hair quick, but he was patient and nice to him as well as gave him a good haircut.< /text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>I was navigating social media and found a barber promoting his work and decided to give it a try. I got in contact with the barber (Carlos) and I got a quick response letting me know when he was available so we can work something out. It was easy to set up an appointment with Carlos. When I got to the shop for my appointment time, Carlos was finishing up his haircut which meant I was up next. This showed that he was on top of his stuff and not behind on appointments. I got my haircut and he gave me exactly what I wanted, he’s a very  talented barber.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Been coming here for about a year. The shop is spacious, clean and modern, with a friendly environment and a good time. Everyone is professional and corteous.
Carlos is my guy, man's a pro, I don't say it lightly. His work is top quality and I can tell all his customers feel the same way. He'll get anything done with excellent results. I will continue my business with him for as long as he cuts hair, no doubt.<//text>

<Review>For years I have been struggling to find a barber that gives good quality cuts. I used to settle for ok haircuts, but my man Carlos has changed it all for me. He is the most professional and talented barber I have ever been to, delivers exactly what you ask for plus more. Came in as a walk in and became a client for good. Not to mention this barber shop overall is very pristine.< /Review>< Pictures>

Came in as a walk-in and Jesus attended me from the get go and made me feel welcomed. I’ve been a consistent customer of his and he has not disappointed once. I come here for quality and I get it every time I come to Presidential. If Jesus isn’t available, he will set you up with someone else. Everyone at Presidential are top tier barbers and pretty much can get any job done. Best barber shop in SoCal hands down and Jesus is the best barber I’ve ever had.< /Text>

Shoutout to BarberKO for always hooking me up with a fresh haircut . Always on point with his appointments, always has his area clean & set. To top it off he always comes through with the nice designs that'll have people asking you where you got your fade at. So come check out this Barbershop & ask for BarberKO.<//Text>

Good and clean shop came here today on Dec. 31st 2018, the VERY LOUD and foul language music is not pleasant AT ALL which is why I give this a 4 star rating. Other than that real good place because of one cool guy, Luis. If you want a real fresh lined up haircut hit up my bro Luis, I will highly recommend anyone to go with him.</text>

<review>Very nice vibe in there. Quiet and laid back music. A bit small but doable. The employees are very friendly and give good service.  The drinks are really tasty, especially the ones with chia seeds.  The elote with hot cheetos is really good as well.</review>< pictures>

Size of the place might be an issue. We went on a weekday and seating was almost at max. However the service was good, the items I tried were good.. I will still need to go back to try a little more of their items before I can officially give it the 5th star. (Review will be updated on my next visit)<//review>

The selection is pretty solid, but the boba is what keeps us going back. It's always soft and sweet. Food is pretty decent too. And never too much ice, which I love.< /Review>

Brought a work group here and loved what we found. Fresh squeezed greyhounds on the happy hour menu?!  Yes, please! Teachers Happy Hour goes from 3-5 M-F and is the best deal in town. Good, local, friendly crowd, nice bar keeps. It's a keeper!

<text>Their drinks are amazing, so is their food. Great location on the Eastside. Brings in neighborhoods locals and the college crowd. Makes for a good variety of folks coming in and out of this location. Would recommend you stay to eat your food and drinks there. Good energy and atmosphere.< /text>< pictures>

I ordered a mangonada and unfortunately didn’t like the seasoning it’s made with. Begrudgingly I notified the staff who quickly remade the drink and was so understanding. Amazing customer service and will definitely return.

Zero- Riverside
Zero is an interesting fusion of American, Hispanic and Asian.  They hay have their own unique blends of cuisine and drinks. Zero has several types of boba. Zero has a $10.00 lunch special that comes with an entree,side and a drink. Though the menu was very interesting and they seemed to be busy it really wasn't up my alley. 2out of 3 in my group wouldn't return.<//Review>

Zero X has a really nice variety of drinks with good quality boba. I personally love their splitcup because I'm really indecisive.  The atmosphere there is really chill and the hours allow it to be a destination for hangouts later into the night. Their prices are reasonable and the wait times are relatively low. There's not much else you could ask for from a place like this!< /Text>

The drinks were great! I got the hot cheeto elote and did not really care for it though so I have to give less stars. Also the size of the location is a little problematic as well. VERY VERY tight space with limited seating. Also the line tends to form where you are seated so people are staring at you eat while they wait in long lines to order. Other than that it was worth the try lol</Text>

Great munchie food! The elote and cheese fries w/XX hot Cheetos  box is the best of both worlds.  Also,  their split cup teas and watermelon slush are to die for.<//review>

<Text>The wings are freaking delicious and they're meaty too..the best ones in my opinion are the honey bqq.Every wing does have a little kick so just a heads up if you don't like spicy. I love to also get their jasmine milk tea with boba. Their boba is always the perfect texture. If you havent been you should definitely make that trip. I'm going there for lunch today!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Today we decided to try this restaurant out with a pick-up order. I spoke to Indy on the phone, who was very patient and polite, and answered all of my questions while placing my order. Once I arrived to the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the interior. The restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean. It is a small spot that feels cozy and yet very spacious in the way they have the tables set up. The ambiance was very pleasant. I noticed that all of their dine-in customers were seated keeping a safe distance during this pandemic, and all staff was wearing their masks appropriately. Both ladies, one of them Indy, were very professional and friendly. My food was ready on time and Indy went over every item with me, making sure that I had everything I ordered before leaving. In regards to the food, I am a fan! And so are my husband and toddler. The portions are good, and the food is very flavorful and clean — and by that I mean that it tastes fresh and is not excessively oily. It’s hard for me to purchase Indian food as I am used to the Indian food I grew up with at home, so trust me when I say that this restaurants’ food is very good. And their customer service clearly matches it! Highly recommended — we have found our new favorite Indian restaurant in town.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Amazing food. We ordered a variety of dishes and everything was top notch!

They don't have dine in due to COVID-19, but the utensils used for packing are very good and easy to use.

Remember to ask for plates if you're not staying in a hotel nearby.< /text>< pictures>

Excellent food, coming from an Indian who loves food😀, great decor reminds me of my childhood days in India. Tucked in a small corner near Shaw and brawley, near Costco, this is the best Indian restaurant in town. My first time there, we loved it. New restaurant but was closed for indoor dining due to Covid. Thanks to owner Kuldip, hope he does well.<//Review>

<Text>I frequent indian food restaurants and am very familiar with it because of my own background. The service here was nice, the atmosphere is nice, they have a large selection of food items but the food here is absolutely terrible. The amazing undertones and flavors are killed by the awful over salting, ive never been to any restaurants that uses that much salt, its insane. Also the naan breads are so thin and dry and hard they look almost like pita with just some garlic toppinga on it, ive been to plenty of other restaurants that make their garlic naan in house and its nothing like this, save the 3 dollars for a small half slice of any of their speacilaty naans. I was really hopijg to love this location since its close to in laws house but unfortunately the food is terrible and over priced. We  couldn't even finish what we bought it was that over powered by salt.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x8094677314ae42f9:0x63a727fa0c3eb0d7</gmap_id></record>

Great food and very customer service oriented. Food is definitely very authentic. Will wait to enjoy dine in when things goes back to normal. We always order our favorite chicken curry and chicken korma with garlic naan. Have not tried other items on the menu yet.< /text>

Fantastic Indian restaurant with a modern sophisticated vibe. The aloo gobi and lamb vindaloo are to die for, other dishes like the turmeric rice make the best late-night leftover snacks!

Great restaurant for date night or take out.
The owner is a nice guy and won’t let you leave without a full belly and a smile.</Review>

My daughter said this is her FAVORITE orange rice (chicken tikka masala) because they actually made the sauce mild, no spice. We placed a large order of butter chicken, tikka masala, chicken vindaloo and aloo gobi. Everything was SO GOOD! We will be back. I would like the nan thicker and not crispy. It was not good this time but maybe because we ordered so many.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I went today for the first time to test out Bay Leaf with the wife and kid. First atmosphere beautiful its a shame COVID hit. Most important taste, flavor, cost, service. The owner Kuldip super nice guy. Food was amazing, so much flavor from the Tikka Masala (it's what they're known for FYI) wife thought portions were small that option changed instantly after she was full and so was I and we still had half the food left.

Must try 😋 this is a Hotspot, a hidden gem, 🤔 I will be coming back again. Thank you Kuldip and your amazing team for making delicious food. Happy wife happy life

FYI I would take pictures but we slammed everything not trying to butcher the beauty. I will post pictures next time.</text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went with my friends in this restaurant. They were Vegetarians, and they were served Malai Kofta's Frozen food packet which was not even properly heated up. Firstly, frozen food should not have been served, and even if it was, it should have been cooked properly. It was raw and cold from inside and the quantity was also less while served.</text>< Pics>

I decided on a whim to get food from here delivered, and it blew away any expectations I had. It’s now my main choice for Indian food, and I’m looking forward to trying everything on the menu eventually. Everything I’ve had has been delicious, even the (omg extremely) spicy vindaloo that pained me to eat. Thankful to have a great restaurant like this around, excited to dine in once it’s safe to do so. Try the pakora!</review>

Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful staff and amazing food! We had Lamb Korma, mixed tandoori grill and two types of naan. Left with extra! Owner was very hospitable and talked with us for awhile. Menu has numerous choices for vegetarian and meat eater alike. We will be back.<//review>

<Text>It was my first time here today and I had a wonderful experience! Very friendly and attentive service, which I appreciated. The food is great, flavorful and larger than expected portions. I had the Ras Malai for dessert and I loved it. I also really like the atmosphere of the restaurant. I will definitely be coming back.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>I love everything about this place. From the wonderful decor tastefully decorating the walls to the warm and personable owner Kuldeep to the absolutely delicious food that will prompt you to tell your family and friends about this little gem.
After trying about 10 different dishes, I ordered my entire office the chicken tikka masala which is a good beginner dish and everyone absolutely loved it.  Feeling a little more adventurous? Try some of the lamb or fish dishes and wash it down with a mango lassi.
If your vegetarian,  you'll have almost a whole page of options and the okra and aloo gobi wont disappoint!
Just go. You'll love it!< /Text><Name>Ryan Wyatt</Name><Rate>5< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x8094677314ae42f9:0x63a727fa0c3eb0d7</Gmap_id>< userid>

Everything was amazing, the Samosa Chaat is my new favorite food. Prices are very fair as well, the restaurant is super clean, and there are so many vegetarian options that I had trouble narrowing down what I was going to get! That hardly ever happens. 10/10< /Text>

Wonderful lunch today at Yakitori West! Very busy but the service was still good. We had two Bento boxes with Spicy Tuna and Tuna sashimi. The tuna was very fresh! We also had the sake sampler!!</Review>

Reasonably good sushi, 60g uni special was tasty but not the fat, high-grade tongues on the posters. Good service. I asked if most people come for the cooked or raw, and they said it was pretty even. Very good happy hour deals, a pitcher of Asahi for $8.< /Text>

<review>Great Japanese operated yakitori place.  While the restaurant is labeled yakitori, they have a broader more izakaya style menu. The yakitori here is all fairly good, the sampler plate is a good place to start to get a broad range of taste. The grilled foods here are all excellent. There's a decent sake selection as well as the standard draft Japanese lager. One outstanding thing is the asari miso shiru (clam miso soup).  Very generous portion with aromatic and delicious mix of the clams with the miso that is very filling.</review>< pictures>

Dinner hours on the weekend can be crowded.  The wait can be upwards of 50 minutes It's a fairly small place with not a lot of tables. I would recommend to get there early.<//Review>

Just OK yakitori. Drive out into South Bay and enjoy real yakotori. Also, the service is a bit under OK. They’ll forget a few of your orders and still charge you for those - so double check your check.<//Review>

<review>My favorite Japanese spot in the Bay.  Great spot for sashimi and try all the apps.  Green mussels and takowasa are our favs.  Lunch bento chicken katsu is great too.  They also offer clam miso soup that is great for clam lovers!  Highly recommended.</review>< Pics>

You can find this place in Ulferts center next to the Asian Bakery. Not sure if it was an off day but the yakitori we ordered was over cooked and the main flavor we got from the chef’s special was a mayo sauce they used with every dish. We liked their chicken soba though. Staff was friendly and attentive.< /Text>

<Review>Not bad.

I've been here a couple of times with my girlfriend and we have tried most things on the menu. Most things are meh. Some I'd stay away from, like the oyakodon because the eggs are overcooked and rubbery. Our favorite is the salmon don, because you get a ton of yummy salmon with some of the eggs! To be honest, we go straight for the salmon and ignore the rest.

Not sure how often we'll be back, but it'll be on our list.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Scallops were undercooked, though I understand you were close to closing doesn't mean you cut out on the quality of making sure your food is cooked to appropriate temperatures or at least safe temperatures for eating, especially in the consumption of raw shellfish. Wayyy over priced for what we really actually received portion wise. Been to better yakitori places closer to the bay or even outside of Vacaville for instance Davis, if ever in Davis do try Yakitori yu-chan. Flavor and price-wise is on point and they actually cook there scallops to appropriate temperatures where it's not overcooked or undercooked. I will not be dining at Yakitori West anytime soon or ever again for that matter.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Great friendly cozy comfortable modern Japanese operated restaurant with fresh ( I mean real fresh) sushi and sashimi.   The seafood udon is the bomb.  Yakitoti skewers are tasty treats.  On top of that the price is fair and the portions of sushi n deafood are more than expected from a typical japanese restairants.< /review>

They have very good Yakitori skewers. Their Grilled Misoyaki Sea Bass is really good, juicy and tender. However, their sashimi is nothing special, so stick to their specialty.< /review>

<review>I came to Yakitori West obviously for the Yakitori. I ended up enjoying the sushi more than the yakitori they served. The restaurant is small and crowds up fast so make sure you get there early. We ordered the Liver, hearts, scallops, and tongue. The heart and scallops were great. However, the liver yakitori was very large unlike any we had seen before and very very dry. Tasted a little like dogfood. The sushi was fresh and the ebi tempura was fantastic. But I wasn't sold on the yakitori. I will be coming back to try it once more and maybe update my review.< /review>< pics>

<Review>I came to Yakitori West for lunch, going to sample a selection of their Yakitori. Unfortunately, they do not serve Yakitori for lunch. That is reserved for the dinner menu only. I was a little bummed, but I decided to try their Bento Box Lunch Special. I asked the waitress to order for me (selected sashimis and mixed tempura). She said thank you for trusting me and went back into the kitchen.

The food was excellent! The fresh was very, very fresh. The tempura was lightly fried and very crispy. I really cannot say anything bad about this spot.

Looks like I need to come back for dinner. If this lunch is a predictor of what their Yakitori will be like, I will order all of it. Not a sample of each...all of it!

Kudos, Yakitori West!</Review>< pics>

The best Japanese Experience in the Tri Valley.   Fresh and quality ingrediences used, most bang for your buck and friendly service.   It is not inexpensive but you get more than you expect for what you pay.   Seafood Udon is great.  For those Uni lover, the Uni & Ikura don is the bomb!  Sushi is one of the freshes I experienced and the Fried Oysters are succulent and tasty and there are so much more.</Text>

Excellent food. The steampot dish is a must eat. All yakitori items are just plain delicious.

UPDATE.  AMAZING! And they just got better with their lunch specials! No one, I say, no one is doing what they're doing right now: high quality food, authentic options, and all for $10 in a bento box. The bento special comes with a big salad, a large portion of rice, and miso soup. You can choose two items from such Japanese true staples as takoyaki (fried octopus balls with seaweed powder, bonita fish flakes, and teriyaki sauce), gyoza (best in the Tri-Valley), salmon teriyaki, Japanese croquettes (fried potato cakes) and chicken karaage (deep-fried boneless chicken to die for). Come eat for lunch and dinner (the kushiyaki grill sampler is the number one choice and best deal) and just enjoy. On weekends, for now you can avoid the lunch crowds. Good food, great pricing, and clean and friendly service. And don't forget to ask for Ramune to wash it down with all your favorite dishes!<//Text>

Having just moved to LA from Oahu, I've now come here a couple times with my wife. The food is phenomenal, and reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants at home. Small place (would maybe seat 16), cool decor, and friendly people. We've tried about half the dishes between us and loved them all.

Usually for the two of us and softdrinks, the price comes out to ~$25.<//text>

My husband and I have been waiting for this place to open for a while now after we read an article about it. We just stopped by and got take out of the winner winner and rice rice baby. Soooo delicious, the fried rice took me back to my childhood memories. Both my husband and I agree this we will be a regular stop for us when we don't feel like cooking. Definitely looking forward to trying other items on their menu.<//text>

This place makes amazing food. Makes me want to go back and give so many other restaurants four stars out of principal because they don't deserve it.
I haven't had any food there that wasn't amazing.</Review>

I am very jazzed that i discovered this small restaurant  via Yelp pumping out (based at least on what i ate today) excellent, flavorful yet subtle food.
The Left Handed Cook (and yes the chef/owner is indeed left handed) is squished into a small non-descript drive in mall next to a Mexican restaurant.
It is on Honolulu in the flats of La Crescenta which is north of Glendale and west of Montrose.
No matter where it is, Kat and are her Chef partner, Tom are pleasant, available, seemingly happy to be operating their business types. Since i was here early today and the only customer i was able to speak to them about a few subjects having to do with being left handed, the Japanese system of training Sushi chefs, etc.
One of the things i enjoy/crave really is to establish a personal but of course only business relationship with business owners so as to attempt to get at the heart and soul of a business. Why do this when there are so many pitfalls that can trip you up in the process?
Well all of that being said, i ordered a couple of things:
Rice Rice Baby
Side order of Fries
The menu board lists the Rice Rice Baby with this ingredient statement: Beef Brisket, Bacon, Kimchi, fried rice, pickled jalapeno, Furikake. Whew!
The first thing that occurred to me is: with so many listed ingredients will it all just be a mish mash of conflicting flavors?
The only thing that i could not taste was the kimchi. But overall, this product Pops with flavor: slow cooked, beefy brisket, a good dose of pickled jalapeno, smoky bacon all topped by a creamy poached egg and spinkled with Furikake ( a japanese seasoning of dried fish, sesame seeds, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt.) and perfectly cooked brown rice.
The Rice Rice Baby is not at all salty (particularly with so many salt forward ingredients) but properly seasoned with salt. It is an unctuously delicious item. A note: Tom please think about adding a "double the brisket for X dollars." I craved more meat.
Fries:
i ordered a side of Fries because the photos posted here gave me a jones for them. And i was correct. These are hand sliced, slightly sweet fries: more like what we used to call Steak Fries. A success for sure. The high level of attention to detail is often more revealingly  apparent with the simplicity of the preparation of these fries than it is in the more complex items. Meaning: if you can make the simple things like fried potatoes special: you will  also appreciably extend that attention to detail to the more complex products.
Yes i realize that i seem to be bubbling over with enthusiasm for The Left Handed Cook: it is because i am. I can't wait to bring my family here so that we can order every thing on their menu.</Text>

Very small and very quirky; like no restaurant I've ever been to. Can't even begin to describe food choices, as they seem to be a fusion of hip ingredients I'm not familiar with. But, I enjoyed the choices, the food, and the owner/ wife was incredibly warm and welcoming, so I wish them every success.
Do not go here expecting typical restaurant choices or if your food choices tend to be conservative.< /review>

Tucked behind some vines hanging off the buildings edge, a short walk through the front to a fabulously designed interior with low lighting and comfy seats. Owned by a cultured, global traveled couple who make you feel welcomed and well fed. The food was amazing, the lamb slid right off the bone, the seafood was perfectly seasoned, OH! And the Moroccan mint tea was a crazy wonderful experience in itself. Best first experience with Moroccan food. Thank you, thank you. Will be back soon.<//Text>< Pics>

This place is wack! The food was super salty, the pita they gave me was hard, my meal was not complete with what it should have come with, the salad looked and tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave it was nasty soggy. The reason why I am even giving them 2 stars is because the hummus was good and the garlic sauce was good as well. The guy that gave me the food was not wearing a mask and was not very nice. Our office will not be ordering food from here ever again.</Review>

This place is certainly one of the best place in the area. Whenever I come to this place I am incredibly satisfied. They maintain their very high  standard service and the highest level of food  they provide. You can never go wrong with this restaurant. Warmly  recommended.< /text>

If it is divine. A little taste of home. Absolutely loved the sea bass, rice, hummus, salad, all the way down to the desert baklava. As for the service and presentation, exceptional. A definite must.<//Text>

<Review>Probably my favorite restaurant in the Burbank area. The food is consistently excellent, and the desserts and coffee are equally good. My personal favorites are the chicken kebab plate and the chicken wrap. A great spot for a full meal or even just coffee and dessert. Highly recommend.<//Review>< Time>

<review>I was hanging out with a couple of good friends of mine, we were craving some good hookah, tired of frequenting the same lounge. We were in the area and found this spot in a humble corner of Glendale. We decided to try it out and had a great time, orange head, mint infused flavor, great music. Check this place out, no regrets here. Have fun!< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>This is a good place to go on a date and share a plate! The Donner Basket was huge! It is like a Med dream dish because you get to try everything, and it's all delicious. Under the salad and mains are fries including regular and waffle sweet potato. I loved the flavors and variety.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb5d9f4a774b:0x3814722330642e36</gmap_id><pics>None< /pics><username>Amy Foster< /username><response>None<//response><date>1604117979252</date><user>107501746869890309227< /user></record></dataset><record>

Went for the first time and was absolutely blown away! The food is amazing; I had the boneless (white) chicken plate and my girlfriend had the filet mignon plate and it was drool worthy! The side of fries is perfection and the garlic spread is the best I've had. New favorite spot.< /text>

Best place around the area and we've tried several. My son and I have become frequent visitors here. If it's your first time you can start with the beef and lamb wrap and try other dishes from there. I promise it'll hit the spot.<//Review>

I love this place. I've been to several locations and the food is consistently tasty and the customer service is excellent too. The Spicy Doner and street cart fries are my go to items. I highly recommend this place for takeout during these times, as they also offer items that you may need in your home such as hand sanitizer and eggs. I can't wait to dine in soon.</Text>

** AVOID ONLINE ORDERING AND/OR DELIVERY **

Marsa Lounge took 2 hours (from the time I submitted my order) to deliver my food. I ordered around 3:40 PM, a time that one can safely assume is NOT busy for restaurants (which google analytics supports in showing this sparsely frequented time as "usually not busy"), and was told by their online ordering system that I could expect delivery "around 4:30 PM Today". After 45 minutes passed the delivery ETA, I called the restaurant to ask about my order that was nearly an hour late. All I was told was "sorry, the delivery guy already left". I still didn't receive my order until around 5:40 PM, about 2 hours after I submitted the order.

This is absurd because the restaurant is about an 11 minute drive (a little over 3 miles) from the address ordered from. How can it possibly take 2 hours to prepare and deliver a 3 item order? It would've been faster to take the bus there, order take out, and then take the bus back. Or, rather, it would've been faster and cheaper to go to the grocery store and cook myself something to eat.

Needless to say, the food was barely warm when it arrived, which checks out as it was likely sitting out for a great deal of time before it was actually out in transit for delivery.

Marsa Lounge should consider either revamping their online order & delivery process to accurately represent delivery ETAs or discontinue offering delivery & online ordering altogether until they are equipped to professionally handle these.

As for the food itself, it wasn't bad. I had not eaten in almost 12 hours so pretty much anything tastes good at that point. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the food was edible and somewhat tasty.

My only other complaint is that the hummus is overpriced, as it is at many restaurants, seeing as it's so much cheaper to make at home. Anyone with a food processor and a brain could make homemade hummus.<//text>

Tbh this became one of my new favorite spots on the Mission just after my first visit. Their feta pie reminded me of the ones my mom makes, and the dessert remind me of my trips to Turkey and the Middle East. Definitely 10/10 on authentic-ness and creativity. Also the owner makes you feel so incredible welcomed - as if you were old friends. Super surprised at how much I enjoyed my visit. Highly recommend checking them out. Will be visiting again next time I'm around.< /text>

<Text>I had contacted Mohamed about an event we were holding in Malibu for 40 people.  We wanted it to be a little nicer, and Mohamed was EXTREMELY helpful and accommodating.  He offered to provide beautiful chafing dishes for all the food he provided, at no additional cost!  The food delivery arrived right on time and the driver set everything up right away without me having to take my attention away from the event.  The food was a huge hit with multiple guests coming up to me and asking the name of the caterer.  Mohamed truly went above and beyond and I would use his services again and highly recommend Marsa Lounge for anyone who needs quality and reliable catering.<//Text>< pics>

We went for the show, and it was so fun!!! All of the performances were awesome, but we specifically love the acrobatics during dessert. I will say that the Pre Fixe is SUPER over priced for the amount of food and type of food, but it was tasty. I would recommend for any special occasions.<//Review>

A hit and a miss according to me. First the misses: 1) Bakalava was exceptionally sweet. 2) The falafel was dry and really hard to even bite into. My friends who used forks and knives had their falafels flying around. 3) They have the worst music I have heard in a restaurant, by far. Loud rap music is not the ideal background while eating kebabs. The hit: 1) The lamb chop and the shrimp kebab were out of this world.< /Review>

I used to like Marsa Mediterranean Cuisine chicken, but this location I ordered a chicken wrap and it was so dry and stale. Not sure what happened. Maybe the quality varies per location.</text>

I love Turkish food and the Turkish culture I've experienced. My colleague lives in the neighborhood, is half-Lebanese, and recommended that I try Shish Ke Baba. We went on a Friday night for dinner and I'm glad we did.</Review>

<review>Discovered on Postmate and decided to try out. I walked since I live 5 minutes away to pick up.  As I opened the door, the food was basically thrown at me from a guy who was NOT wearing a MASK. I must admit the food was okay, but unfortunately I will not order again in the future.</review><GmapID>0x80c2bb5d9f4a774b:0x3814722330642e36< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My go-to Marsa Mediterranean Cuisine never disappoints. Get the Lamb shawarma, add fries, tahiti and spicy sauce. The portions are huge, and the meat is juicy, you get the most bang for your buck here. Winner.</Text>

Nassar is awesome! The hookah is great and they're well known for their food as it is also a catering company. Sometimes their chicken is a little too salty. 5 stars because it's the closest hookah spot near Santa Monica that won't mf you in price!< /Review>

Amazing chicken and beef. Grilled chicken is tender like butter, beef tastes like authentic Nicaraguan or Argentine churrasco. Cannot recommend this place enough.</Review>

<Review>I am not reviewing the food since I have no idea if it's good or not.
I placed and order at this restaurant through Eat24 (Yelp owned food service) at 7:37 pm. The estimated arrival time was 8:09 pm. Shortly after 9 pm I tried three times to call the restaurant and the line was busy, subsequently I called again at 9:10 pm and the line rang and went to voicemail. I tried again numerous times over the proceeding 10 minutes.
In the midst of this I contacted Eat24 through their instant chat support and they attempted to make contact numerous times and failed, by 9:30 pm I was done and my kid and wife literally went to bed hungry.
At 9:55 pm the delivery arrived and I turned the driver away, at the point it had been 2 hrs 15 mins since the order had been placed.
No call, no apology, no response. Quite frankly I don't really care if their food is good or not, because everything else stinks, and Eat24 was also remorseless in Theo handling of the situation.</Review>< Pics>

SA recycling: Workers are polite, organized and actually quite diligent about following guidelines. And I really appreciate how they conduct business. However, they are quite slow. Wow, they are slow. There were about ten people ahead of us with I'd say eight of them only recycling cans (including myself) and it still took fifty minutes to get out of there.  Hence, the three stars.</text>

The customer service here is the worst I've encountered. One of the scale ladies is rude. The two cashiers iv'e encountered have no respect for the customer, have a total disregard of work environment Think they own the company.</Text>

Do not go here. Terrible price on copper, I didn't notice it until i got into my car and checked the receipt. My friend with me recycled some copper last Saturday at a spot in Santee that had copper #1 at around $1.90 a lb, these guys had it at around $1.25. I went back out to those guys who "work" there and they said they don't price match. Will never go there again. I wanted to put my plumbing license on file and wouldn't accept a picture of my license, said they had to send in the real thing to corporate to put me on file. Once I go get the cash Monday I'll never go back. The people working there are next to worthless as well. Go to Troy recycling in lemon Grove for good customer service. The guy tried to mix up my #1 and #2 and count it all as #2, when we asked what he was doing he had us sort it all out while he talked with his buddy. I truly feel ripped off. When we did the math on the price drop it was around $80+ we lost going here.</text>

Absolutely by far the worst SA. Incompetent workers in yard and scale. I have been to SA all over 5states. This one absolutely awful. Fernado is a snake. Deliberately rip people off. Dont waste time. They need to fire everyone but office girls.</Text>

<Review>Great place to recycle your auto through California State program aka BAR (Bureau of Auto Repair). This is the only accepted one in S.D. that will take your car and give your refund from the program. The staff were friendly and helpful through the process. Lots of parking on site. They also recycle almost all metals and other items. Easy to find and located right across the street from 32nd Street, US Navy Base and Churche's Chicken. Handicapped parking and rest area available.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Rude employees at the car recycling center. Whenever you ask them a question they tel you oh you can take your car to LA, since they know they are the only one in san diego.
I was in line for over an hour and everybody that came in after was helped before.
I spoke to the manager and she did apologize about her useless employees, a very nice lady they need more like her.<//Text><userid>114274907089761630426</userid><gmap_id>0x80d953a7e712a6af:0x6596a42c44b092b1<//gmap_id>< Date>

Wonderful store with so much to offer, and friendly helpful staff.  I was able to get dried corn, cal, fresh cilantro, and 3 of the 4 dried chilies I use in my sauces (nearly impossible to find the fourth one, chipotle meca, in the United States, so understandable.)  I don't give 5 stars easily, but they deserve the rating. (Pictured purple corn and white corn)<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The staff is friendly but apart from that they take time to attend. The schedule says that they open at 8:00 am and sometimes also at the time they want

Excellent customer service, quality inventory, no appt necessary, comfortable waiting area and a team that  knocked it out of the park. Best of all... the best and biggest savings.

Worst place ever! If I could give 0 stars I would ! But they won't let me so 1 star it is even though they dont deserve it at all!

Paid them to do a job! Got in the car driving home and noticed the job they were supposed to do, they didn't do! Went back the next day and they wanted to argue that they did there job and I messed it up! Ummmm NO! will never return to a place that acts like they don't make mistakes! AMD this wasn't the 1st run in with this place,  but gave them the benefit of the doubt. Never again! Especially for the prices I pay there!</Text>

When I ask the price I expect to be told the price out the door, 3 times I've been there the price is jacked up $10 - $20 when it's done. The last time I went there I was told I was buying Cooper's but they put Doral's on instead. I put a cheap set of Catchfors on my truck and the sidewall just blew apart on the freeway, lesson learned don't buy cheap tires.<//review>

They're not terrible, but close to it. With the 15 minutes I spent there inquiring about a single new replacement tire (or used if they had a good one), I dealt with three individuals, and they all seem to have their own agenda. First, I was presented with the cheapest tire and was told that its a good tire made in the USA. I must have appeared a little disheveled to be presented with their cheapest tire, I was working on my car after all. A little googling revealed the tire is a major Chinese brand. I asked for other brands and was presented with Toyo and another name brand one, but he was not willing to separate the set. He leaves simply stating, let me know if you want it. It seemed they weren't interested in doing business with me. I simply took my money elsewhere.</text>

<Review>This place really cares about their customers. When I needed tires and alignment done on my car; mind you I live up in Challenge where road is scarce but gravel and dirt road rules. Makes it hard on tires. Anyways as you know Chico Tires & Wheels took care of my 2015 Ford Fusion. Great service, all served up with a smile.< /Review>< pics>

They have faith prices on tires however they must be under staffed because there is rarely someone at the counter to offer you help when you get in. I have had to call them before from inside the building just to get someone to come.out and help the line of people that were waiting at an empty counter. The staff was nice enough but they need more people.</review>

I took in my tire to be mounted and balanced. The service was quick, they where friendly and very affordable. It was a hot day so I stepped inside hoping to cool off and that's exactly what I was able to do. They had the air conditioning on and a nice soft chair to sit in while I waited.
The reason that they didn't get that last star from me is because although they had water, my personal preference on a hot day is ice cold water. They had a water machine, but for whatever reason the water was cold. What matters most is the service and it was excellent very< /Review>

Great prices, quick and the staff is top notch. It's always a problem trying to find the tires for my wife's BMW and every other shop in town other than the dealership had to order that size. Of course we could have went to BMW which is a block away from Chico Tires but at their prices the tire should be gold plated with silver accents. At Chico Tire &Wheels they had it in stock at a great price and we were fixed and out in minutes. It's the only time I've bought tires and had them on the car for less than a 100 bucks each in a long time.< /text>

Best place in town to get rims and or tires! The guys are really nice, helpful and fast. They have a great selection of rims and tires and even more now that they moved into a way bigger and nicer shop. They have the best prices in town! I wont go to another shop as long as they are open :)< /text>

I showed up 15 minutes before closing and I was amazed at how friendly and helpful they were. I purchased 2 used tires that looked new with lots of tread for fair price. I will return again with my other vehicles.< /Text>

Chico tires helped me have peace of mind. They helped me out of a bad situation. I'll always be grateful to them, they didn't have to help me, but they did, one of the guys who works at Chico tire told me they were just trying to help in this terrible situation NorthCal is in right now. He said, we're all neighbors, we just need to pull together. They're courteous, very reasonable in their prices, and fast. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHICO TIRES AND WHEELS.< /Review>

<text>Horrible! They patched my tire a while back which was fine. We took the tire off and took it to them with the tire down to them. THEY TOOK THE SPARE OFF AND PUT THE ORIGINAL TIRE ON (very important detail.) Today the patch gave out, which it shouldn’t have, so we tried to take the tire off and they have murdered one of the studs on my tire. After an hour I finally got the nut off and took the tire to a different shop. They patched it for free and told us the previous patch job wasn’t well done. I have to get back to my job at this point and since my boyfriend purchased the patch the first time he offered to go in. Tried to get them to replace the stud, which my boyfriend even offered to pay for the replacement stud itself, but asked them to replace it for free since they messed it up. They said the guys at the tire shop messed it up except I took the tire off. My boyfriend told them about how we haven’t touched the tire until today and that one of their employees put the original tire back on. They were rude and dismissive. They don’t know that I took this tire off myself with hand tools to repair the flat caused by their bad patch job. I had to wrench on that thing forever because it was cross threaded.< /text><Date>1526513473115</Date></record>

I buy about 7 sets of tires from these guys every month being that I am in the car business. I've shopped around and they are by far the best price around! Always quick and efficient, quality work and knowledgeable staff. I don't even bother with other tire shops at this point. I look forward to doing a lot more business with Chico Tire and Wheel for years to come.</review>

Pricing is good.  Three star because they scratched my rim and didn’t tell me about it. They even tried to hide it using a permanent marker.  These guys are not trustworthy. They kept one of my rims without asking me if I still want it.< /Review>

<username>Jeff Stanley</username><text>Was passing through Chico and needed to buy a set of tires. This place is small, but they can get you what you need fast, for a great price. I bought a set of new Toyos for my Accord. They ride quiet and smooth and I saved about 40% compared to the Honda dealer. They had the size I needed in 30 mins and I was on the road an hour after I arrived, where the dealer insisted I wait 24 hours to get the correct size. I’m super glad I found this little place.<//text></record>

The manager showed me some str's 520 deepdish he said he could let them go for 850 with tires then next day i came to pick em up hes wasn't there and another guy went to show me the rims but they were not str's they were a cheaper brand then i tried telling him those wernt it he said come back tomorow the manager will be here.  So i go for a third time and the manager straight out calls me a lier that those were the rims he showed me but you can clearly see the difference i barly got my money back.  Just go to americas tire shop way better service and quality tires these guys are a waste of time trying to scam people.<//Review>

just got new wheels and tires today, I will never go to another shop in this town, chico wheel and tire was no nonsense, they knew what they were doing and they were quick, got out of there cheap, clearly the focus is customer happiness not scamming you out of all of your money</Text>

These outstanding gentlemen have year after year provided quality service with an emphasis on customer satisfaction and amazing deals. They provide quality tires at competitive prices. Out of the many times i have purchased from them over many years i have never once been dissapointed or not satisfied with any aspect of their business. Simply amazing! 5 stars is not enough!<//Text>

It was a near perfect experience. I love that the doctor got down on the ground with Bodhi and made him feel so comfortable. Best vet visit I have ever experienced.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>We have visited this vet for years, only because of proximity. Recently, their vet missed a sizable area of potential skin cancer on my dog’s belly. We had to take her in to have a second dose of a vaccine administered, and they informed us that they would charge us again to look at the skin (although it should have been examined at her physical exam just weeks prior, and I had asked about having it looked at days after the exam when scheduling the second dose of vaccine).  When I asked to have her records sent to me to transfer to another vet, they then refused to give my dog the second dose of the vaccine (who was there at the clinic with my husband waiting). Incredibly unprofessional, and negligent of the examining doctor to miss the problem.
At the time of the issue , the staff refused to allow us to speak with the working doctor/vet regarding our concerns. So it is incredibly disingenuous for the vet to respond to our review. Additionally, the doctor that saw our dog for their original physical was not working the day we were refused help, so, again, the staff response is inappropriate/a blatant lie.  After we were not given the help we needed, even though we made staff aware of the issue within a week of our original appointment, we asked to have our records for transfer to another vet. It was after the staff was notified of our intent to change providers that they refused to complete the scheduled vaccination out of spite,, while still refusing to allow us to speak with the vet to discuss our concerns..<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This was the best experience I’ve ever had with a vet. So excited to continue bringing my pets here!!

The vet spoke with me over the phone for about 30 minutes on my dogs care plan. It was very thorough. They were up front about prices. They seem to really care about my dogs and they’re well-being. Really excited to have a new vet for my pups!< /Text>

I just moved to the area and my 13-yr old Shih-Tzu was in need of his annual exam and dental cleaning. He ended up having to have 7 teeth pulled...the Doctor and his staff were fantastic!! The doctor called me a few times and was incredibly thorough with explaining the process and the rationale of why it was important to have the teeth pulled. They were very professional and responsive throughout his procedure and the day after. I highly recommend La Costa Animal Hospital.< /Text>

I have a baby boy 6 month old Bengal cat.  Originally he was going to be an indoors only cat but I decided to walk him on a leash in front of my house and he comes to work.  I choose Aviara Animal Hospital at first, and made a big mistake.  They traumatized my cat so bad there and made me feel like they were all about the money. The vet even called from inside and said they had a rough time holding my cat down.  I took him to La Costa Animal Hospital and was getting ready for another possibly bad experience.  Not only did they make it wonderful for Oslo, he was stress free.  They did not try to push services and the vet and staff were very caring and professional.<//Text>

So far so good. We have had our lab pup here since Feb 2020. They have handled the Covid 19 situation very well. Communicating their hours and protocols.  Our dog has been well taken care of thru a pandemic and what more is there to say. More expensive than Surfside our previous pet hospital but you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR and we learned that the hard way   Good job guys at La Costa<//review>

Best vet ever. Reasonable, kind, humane, these people are top tier vets without a massive investment. We've had all kinds of situations with our fur babies and have made different financial decisions at different stages. La Costa Animal Hospital has treated us with total respect and kindness at every stage. We've had 4 dogs treated by them and plan to have plenty more!< /Review>

Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, the staff at La Costa Animal Hospital made our puppies first vet visit as easy as possible for us. Unfortunately, we weren't able to be in the room with our pup but we were still able to ask any questions over the phone as the Doctor examined our pup Walker in real time. Would definitely recommend La Costa Animal Hospital to any dog owners in the La Costa area!< /Text>

Be aware when taking your pet to this animal hospital.  They are about maximizing their revenue not the best care for your pet.  I am compelled to write this review after 2 encounters. First, when pricing the procedure to neuter our terrier.  La Costa AH was 3 times the going rate of other clinics in the area (for the same treatment).  Second, was for his rabies vaccination.  They pumped him up with several other vaccinations that caused him have a significant reaction.  The opinion of an emergency animal hospital was that he should have never received that level of immunizations in one visit. I called the office to make them aware and they showed no empathy for their mistakes only quoting their policy.< /Text>

I've been taking my two, now elderly, cats here for about 10 years and I've always been happy.  If a pet needs a procedure, or gets a diagnosis, the doctor explains the full range of options, and answers all of my questions. He's very patient.  He also understands that your budget could be limited and is never pushy.  The office staff and technicians are all great as well, friendly, positive, and great with my pets.  Definitely recommend.</text>

A very honest and caring team works here.
They have taken care of at least 6 of my loved ones over the years and are very understanding and listen to me when we discuss each situation.
They are helpful in processing our pet insurance claims and send our dogs home with cute bandanas too.
I highly recommend this place.</Review>

I have never had a poor experience with La Costa Animal hospital in all of the years I have needed veterinary services. I believe the doctors and staff to be some of the most amazing and trustworthy folks to care for my animals. The veterinary techs and support staff are incredible, and have lavished my crazy German Shepard/Labrador Retriever mix with so much love! Dr. Schatzle and Dr. Ecker are top notch vets, that also happen to be great with people!

Vet visits are never cheap....but I feel like I always receive excellent information and guidance in determining what makes sense for my pet. There is never any pressure to up sell services or do things that really aren’t necessary. These folks really do advocate for your pet and your family...definitely not something I’ve experienced with other vets.  I wont take my sweet Anakin to just anyone...and I always feel comfortable letting such a loving and experienced staff provide care for my 80 lb. fur baby.

I am on the private insurance plan with La Costa Animal Hospital. I get charged a monthly fee, but most of the cost of day in/standard tests and annual exams are covered. It really means that I’m paying small amounts each month that covers those tests. Almost like a layaway plan for services you know your pet will need! It isn’t a requirement, but I sure find it easier for my household budget to do a little at a time!

Check them out...you’ll really like everyone on staff! Brittany, Misty and Ashley are simply the best!! Tell them hi for me!</review>

<Review>Dr. Schatzle has been our pup's vet for 13+ years, we thoroughly trust him & Dr. Ecker with our boy's care. The vet techs & support team are all friendly, caring & professional. Appreciate the follow up after visits. They offer a Petly wellness plan that's been cost effective & helpful, especially for senior pet needs.</Review><date>1567833261064<//date><gmap_id>0x80dc0c9ff98590f7:0x309fb6ae1b0e6dda</gmap_id><username>Janelle Johnson< /username>< pics>

I've been going to La Costa Animal Hospital for about 8 years now. They are wonderful and always so helpful. Having two pets the cost can skyrocket but here they have always worked with me and haven't pressured us into any sort of treatment. I have experienced that at other vets. I wouldn't think about going anywhere else.<//review>

The entire staff is excellent.  My dogs are my children.  I will NOT take them to just any vet.  I was new to SoCal and was sent to another vet for a first visit. $600 dollars later, I was told that one of my dogs was in kidney failure mode.  Distraught, and wanting a second opinion I went to Dr. Schatzle- who is wonderful, took his time on my first visit, spent an hour with me and my two Wheaten Terriers (both senior dogs).  Turns out, she was not in kidney failure.  He is also up on the latest wellness technology for dogs.  Great compassion, sensitivity and overall understanding. Brittany is one of the warm friendly faces to greet you upon arrival, and amazing at what she does.  Here's to the entire staff- 5 star- thumbs up. Last, the Dynasty Luxury post is clearly a very angry person.  Take all the five stars comments and look at this one post.  There is a theme- a great theme- of a great operation there at La Costa Animal Hospital.<//text>

Great experience for me and our dog!  Great service from the vet tech’s to the Vet.
Getting into see the vet was a breeze, and when it came to discussing treatments and cost, had a genuine conversation!<//review>

I highly recommend La Costa Animal Hospital.  Dr. Schatzle and Dr. Ecker don't only care for your pets, they also care about them.  The veterinary assistants are wonderful and very knowledgable.  We now have an 11 year relationship with this office, and we look forward to extending that time as they continue to provide excellent care to our sweet pup, Champ.</Text>

We have been bringing our dogs to La Costa for 20 years and have always received excellent, caring service. The doctors, and all of the support staff, have shown patience, kindness and professional skill to our beloved pets. We highly recommend this vet.<//Text>

<user_name>ScullySazSarah</user_name><Text>My experience with Dr. Schatzle and La Costa Animal Hospital's support staff exceeds expectations, after many months of searching for a good vet... While establishing care and watching everyone work together with our (now) older, illness-prone, rescue kittens, I was given various options and recommendations for their healthcare...afforded enough time and flexibility to consider not only what is best practice for felines, in general, but also what is appropriate to our pets' singular environment at home. Various avenues of treatment have been proposed for our cats' conditions in relation to their lab results, including vaccines and ideal timelines for followup care both at home or in office, as needed. I've not felt pressured or upsold in any way. The cats have never been so comfortable - carefully examined and handled - as they have been with La Costa Animal Hospital's skilled team. I trust Dr. Schatzle & staff to hear out my personal and financial concerns for our animals, provide excellent care to them and give informed advice in line with our current and future needs.</Text><UserId.>105649227904729019699< /UserId.>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Once again, Dr. Schatzle, Misty and the attentive staff here
were available, immediately, upon my arrival, to examine Simba and determine that he had remnants of a 'stinger' from a Bee stuck in his paw and carefully removed it.
Simba stopped biting on his foot and returned to a normal
status .....

I had 'paniced' when he was behaving erratically recalling the 2 prior Bee stings when Simba at age 1 yr. and again at
3 years, went into anaphylactic shock and was literally "saved" by the Vets and staff there, then ....He turns 8 on April 18, 2017.

You can count on this facility to have your beloved pets
treated with loving kindness along with professionalism.</text>< pics>

I’m from New Jersey and we have a lot of diners there. I can tell you that this place is a legitimate diner that can compare to NJ’s best. I recommend ordering the French toast cinnamon rolls. Freakin’ delicious!</Text>

<Text>Sunny's Restaurant is one of the last TRULY GREAT Family Style, American Restaurants, that I know of in this area. I have been eating at Sunny's for (at least) 30 years (on & off) now. Over the years, I've had the pleasure not only of trying everything on the menu, at one time or another, but also of getting to know the Terrific service staff. In addition to the Waiters/Waitresses, it's been my honor to become good friends with the owners/founders of Sunny's, Andy & Cindy, as well as their kids (roughly my age) Summer & Shadow. Now for the Good Stuff™:
THE FOOD-
All of the food served at Sunny's is prepared the Old-Fashioned way. For example, if you order a turkey sandwich, it's prepared with freshly (in-house) roasted turkey, carved straight off the bird. This style of fresh made food (never canned or frozen), carries through to all the dishes they make. I LOVE the Daily Specials, because they are usually -$2 Off the full menu price. On Monday, I ordered my FAVORITE Dinner, 1/2 Fried Chicken Dinner. The chicken is better than KFC, Popeye's, Church's, etc. Soup or Salad, Choice of Veg, Choice of Potato, Choice of Bread. All this for about $10.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sunny's Restaurant to anyone with a Good Appetite!< /Text>< GmapID>

First time here, but gotta say this won't be the last.  The service was amazing,  from the server to the hostes.  Friendly and courteous.  The food was great,  I had the full rack of ribs and it was amazing.  Will definitely be coming back here again.< /Text>

Food was OK not the best not the worst. My omelet was a little wet on the inside, probably from the green peppers and onions. I really enjoyed this place in the past, but have the feeling things have changed. The other thing I noticed was a lot of flies in the dinning area which kinda grossed me out. I probably won't be coming back any more.</Text>

Their breakfast is very good! Unfortunately, since I've only had their breakfast, I can't speak to the rest of their menu... But if you're looking for a good breakfast spot that serves breakfast all day, this should be an easy choice for ya.<//text>

I think this is one of my favorite places to dine when go to California and the meals are a throw back to my military days. Opened and ran by a marine at one time and r as n in the same manner now. The staff is excellent the food is a throw back to my military days. If you served five if a try. If not give it a try. You will enjoy.< /Review>

I order the eggs hard boiled in the shell to go because it's too much food for me.  Then I usually have half of the ham to also take home because it's such a big piece and thick. Today waitress was Brook who gave excellent service. I gave her a $4 tip, which is about 30%.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Coming here was like traveling in time, in the good old times in which you could have a hearty but nutricional breakfast at excellent prices and magnificent service included.
Definitely recommend this place to everyone, you won't be dissapointed at all.
The menus for morning afternoon or evening dining are great with a variety of choices that satisfy any appetite, and reinforce GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
DON'T MISS IT, if in Orange County.<//Text>

Very nice place to visit really good comfort food very good prices and the staff is the bomb very nice people family-owned. Try the turkey dinner they have during it's about eleven or twelve dollars but you get at least 4-5 servings out of it easy and it tastes great!!! Also the roast beef and serranos sandwich I believe is really good teether turkey and Serrano or roast beef but it's a hot sandwich it's so yummy</Review>

<Text>My first time dining at Sunny's! What a delightful experience. Being from the south, I thoroughly enjoy homestyle country cooking. The Thanksgiving style turkey dinner was incredible. I also love large portions. Like most southerners I have a large appetite. I actually brought part home cause I couldn't finish it. Can't wait to go back for breakfast and for sure Thursday for beef stroganoff! A special shout out to Natalie who is an absolute top notch waitress. Service perfection!< /Text>< Name>

It was 3/4" thick and cooked medium rare. New England clam chowder was good but tasted more like a gumbo soup. Service was helpful and freindly.  I do building maintenance as a job and noticed the place looking very clean and despite being an older building well maintained- certainly the best in this area for a family style restaurant.</Text>< Pics>

The staff are very attentive  and considerate most of them have worked there for years. The food is good and nicely served. You can have a lovely family meal in a family atmosphere.  A number of the reviews appearing have nothing to do with this very nice restaurant and it's hard working staff. They are expressing political  views that have no place hurting these people working hard to make a living. Give Sunny's a try they are very nice.<//review>

<review>I had a bacon avocado burger that was pretty decent,  but would've been great if the meat had been seasoned. The fries were also pretty good, but if they'd also had seasoning and were a tad crisper, they would've been perfect. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.

I keep visiting Sunny's for a weekend breakfast meal because they are always warm and friendly to their customers.  The food has always been well prepared and each server I've encountered has taken their position in both a professional and friendly manner.  The staff has added to the overall great service.< /text>

<text>Nice family friendly diner near Goldenwest College. Been coming here for years.

Food: Decent at the least.  Burgers, sandwiches and breakfast is what you expect to be good at a place like this... and it does not disappoint. I love the salad dressing and iced tea as well.

Price: a little pricey for a diner. But this is HB so it’s not far from expectation.

Service: In the past, I was never impressed with the service at Sunny’s.  But in the past year it has been much better.  I would say GOOD service basing it on 2018 forward. Maybe they have some new waiters or management.  Not sure, but quality recently.

We never have to wait to get seated. That’s important.

I can go to Denny’s for the same food and maybe a bit cheaper. But I like the atmosphere here and great location.<//text></record>

This restaurant is one of my favorites. It is very near where I live. The kitchen is very flexible about letting you personalize your menu, within reason. I would have to agree the service needs a lot of improvement ~ it is luck of the draw. The fried zucchini, all the food is very good. Very casual.<//Text>

Me and my family have been coming here for years. I love the environment and people here so much. It has always reminded me of my grandparents, even though some of them have passed on. It just gives you warmth when you walk in and reminds you of family. I just wished the beef stroganoff was a daily menu item! 😂</Text>

<Review>I will change my rating from a three to a four after they change their rancid cooking oil, which makes everything off of their griddle taste like paint.

Overall, their food is pretty good; their service is okay. Considering that when one is famished, and doesn't feel like waiting up to a half an hour or more to be seated at the better restaurants in Huntington Beach, this place is always there as an option.</Review>< gmap_id>

I hadn't been to Sunny's in several years prior to today. It was decent the last time, but didn't leave an impression. Today changed that. The food, server and atmosphere were all terrific... and they are most reasonably priced. The only issue I had was with the tiny parking lot.<//Review>

Needs an upgrade. It had a foul odor the day I arrived and my water tasted like chlorine. The oil in the fryer must have been very old because it tasted poorly and was burned.  The waitress HAD to see it to serve it, which was shocking.  Or she just didn't care.<//Text>

<Text>Awesome Food, Amazing Staff, Service is ALWAYS Top-Notch!! You can't beat the week night specials. Lots of Free Parking. All the food is prepared Home Style, in other words if you order a turkey sandwich, they carve a piece of turkey off the bird. It's that fresh!!< /Text>< Pics>

Very tasty and large portion so had to take almost half to go.  No soup today so had to go with the salad which was blah iceberg lettuce laying in water (use a salad spinner why don't you :) with a few croutons, a couple olives and some shredded carrots.

Not a chain. A bit more homey than most. Would be 5 stars except they're stingy with coffee refills.

Had Thanksgiving dinner here. OMG! $22. EACH serving had about 2 pounds of Turkey and a pound of ham along with stuffing, mashed potatoes and candied sweet potatoes with marshmallows. Splits of wine are available. Service was impeccable.< /review>

If you want a real family style restaurant that serves an excellent breakfast all day, then go to Sunny's. Friendly staff clean and food like your mom makes if your mom is an excellent cook. Oh, and reasonably priced too! The menu is full of favorites!</review>

Sometimes its great and other times it's just okay.  I imagine that's due to whatever cook is working that day or shift.  I ordered breakfast a few things which was really good but then I ordered fish& Chips that was HORRIBLE! . The Waitresses are not the best either but they mostly are younger girls With not so much of a personality .

So I would say,  go ahead and try Sunny"s since the right chef may be working that day.<//review>

<resp>None</resp><Rating>1</Rating><Review>One hour from meal, both suffered stomach aches! Wendy, restaurant "owner" was extremely RUDE trying to force us to pay bill BEFORE finishing meal, and refused to provide RECEIPT, saying to look at credit card bill when it arrived! She got angry because one fork and spoon were dirty and I asked for another, plus extra napkins; she left the one which wrapped the dirty fork and spoon and only brought ONE. Suspect PREJUDICE (?)I can't understand the animosity, although of the 2 times we have been there, only two other people were there in the WHOLE RESTAURANT! NEVER going back, hopefully she won't over change credit card, because she REFUSED to give us a receipt, and if she does, she'll probably claim it was "a mistake". 😕 What? No ZERO Rating?< /Review>< name>

<Review>Normally I'm not a fan of chain's like Denny's or I-Hop or such so when my mother dragged my here for breakfast I went grudgingly. To my surprise though the breakfast was on point. Not many restaurants know how to correctly make eggs sunny side up but their's is on point every time. Best part is the portions are HUGE. I wanted to dislike this place..but I actually love it. Best breakfast.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Food was alright, not spectacular. However staff, particularly the blonde behind the counter was exceptionally rude. When we asked for to go containers we were accused of theft, when we simply wanted to know if they had a smaller container for butter. She refused to give me a bag despite giving bags to other customers, claimed she ran out. When I asked for the owner, the waitress said it was the rude blonde. I asked the rude blonde her name and was told none of my business. I mentioned I would mention her attitude and lack of hospitality in my yelp review she told me to go right ahead. Felt discriminated and not welcomed at all. She was rude and insulting in front of other customers. Not at all the pleasant dinner I had hoped for with my mother before mother's day . If I could give zero stars I would.</Review>

Really good quality food and service. A really relaxed environment with genuine staff and hearty, but not greasy food. A personal thanks to Summer and the nice waitresses; I left a very expensive DSLR which is very important and meaningful to me and it was kept safe until the next day - this means a lot to me. The warmest thank you to the team.</Text>

I eat here regularly and really enjoy this place. I've enjoyed Sunny's for about 10 years. Note-if you're looking for some hipster, fusion, happening place then this probably isn't for you. Sunny's is old school, diner, American food. The prices are reasonable and the food good, basic fare. Their portions are generous and the variety seems wide.

They have wonderful, hearty breakfasts and I have enjoyed everything I've ordered over the years although I'm partial to the Country Breakfast. They have daily dinner specials that are a good deal and seasonal specials, all of which are good deals and tasty food.

As for the staff, everyone I've encountered over the years has taken reasonably good care of us and, because I've eaten there over such a long period of time, they will recognize me and extend a warm welcome.

I agree that this is probably a place favored by a slightly older crowd and that's just fine with me. There are also families and a variety of ages that I've seen there too. I don't think I've seen any hipsters, though, so maybe not the place to go if you're looking for someplace trendy and hip.

Maybe one of the reasons for a preponderance of negative reviews on Google is the fact that the older people, and there are a bunch, who eat there aren't as familiar with social media, online review sites, and the importance of online reviews. They just now that they enjoy Sunny's and are probably okay that not everyone is as into the Sunny's experience like they are.

As for the decor, yeah, they could probably do with an update or refresh; however, as we all know, when that happens the ambiance, and some would say "charm" of the place would change, as well as the prices, undoubtedly. However, they entire center where Sunny's is located has undergone an exterior remodel/modernization that, as of this review, is nearly complete. Consequently, the outside is looking much cleaner and more modern but the interior is mostly unchanged.

I understand that people's experiences can vary widely in any service industry but I would encourage anyone who's thinking about eating at Sunny's to give it a try and come with an open mind. Don't let the haters discourage you; who knows, maybe you'll find the charm in this place as I have done. In a way, it's kind of like going back in time to when you could go to a neighborhood diner and just eat good food with friends.

Enjoy!<//text>

<text>Not from HB, son had a B-ball game near here so we stopped in for a quick bite. Food was great, service was FANTASTIC! Even though we live in Orange my wife and my son wants to come back soon. Excellent spot to eat, and here is a swap meet across the street at the college on the weekends.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I was here a couple weeks ago on business and wanted something local not chain. Well, I think a truck stop diner would've been a better choice! Not sure where this "family" restaurant gets their recipes from, but I wouldn't step in this establishment ever again.</Review></record>

Much better than any of the Trump properties' restaurants. :-) Seriously, not bad at all. Clean, family/traditional feel, good food at fair prices. Please ignore any extremely bad reviews from the time of Trump's presidency run through his first year or so as President.</review>

Typical diner fare. Service is friendly and quick. Lots and lots of the elderlies. It's a place where old timers go to get their familiar food. You can sit for hours doing the crossed puzzle. The waiters and service staff recognize the regulars . Nothing fancy in terms of food ..just like a Denny's ..but friendlier . Credit card accepted . Parking can get difficult during weekends. People go to the swap meet across the street before or after eating.< /Text>

This is my favorite restaurant for breakfast. Andrew, Summer, and the rest of the staff are personable and offer a wonderful menu. The Ortega Chile quesadilla, salads, and homemade soups are personal favorites with mimosa.  Many of the customers are regulars like us.< /review>

Went on YELP to complain about the service I received and my response was from the owner who went on a rant about Hillary Clinton and the crooked government, and then I googled her. She tried to sue Trump for sexual harrassment. Who is this lady? And why would I ever want to do business with her ever again? Now I have more than one reason to never visit this over priced place. I will tell everyone I know about my experience. As an owner of a business the customer is always right, if the service was bad, you address it, apologize, and make it right so they come back. Duh!<//text>

<Review>I have experienced Sunny's in many of its different incarnations over the past 25 years and there is one thing that stands out. The core/heart of Sunny's has never changed. The same attitude and customer service shines through no matter how they spell the name or what the exterior looks like. If you want good food at a decent price in a friendly atmosphere Sunny's is the place to go.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I've been coming here since we moved here 9 years ago.  Not too often but this is the place when I want a great full filling breakfast it reminds me of back home in North Carolina.

O'Brian Potatoes extra well done my favorites...WARNING: The toast is usually drenched in butter so you may want to say dry toast.  The cafe is great quality.

I am René the Barber, only @ ABC3 BARBER STUDIO & I highly recommend this place.</Text>

<review>Came here with the hub one one day for a late lunch. Staff wasn't very welcoming, very clicky with some obvious regulars. We were treated like an afterthought. The food, while there were old classic options, tasted like it was frozen and reheated. I can't imagine how this place stays open.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The manager said she'd replace the meals but never came back. We could see her laughing and flirting with another customer. We waited for about 40 min, estimated our bill for the drinks we had actually gotten and left cash. We went to McDonald's afterward since she took our plates and we couldn't eat and received better food and service, I think that says it all. Worse than McDonald's.</Text></record>

There was trash on the floor. The bathrooms were disgusting. The food was not fresh and it was of low quality and it even tasted like I was eating cardboard.  The staff were unattentive. I even overheard the employees saying that the owner turns tricks in the back storage room. Horrible experience and probably the worst restaurant I've ever been too.<//Text>< pictures>

My mom and I decided to try out Sunny's on our way to my sisters birthday party recently. What a mistake. My salad was completely inedible and had so much salt, it almost burnt my lips.

I was in HB two weeks ago and at at this restaurant. I got very sick and had to go to the emergency room. When I called to speak to the manager, I was told the owner would call me back. The owner never called me back. I would not recommend this restaurant. The silverware was dirty, the seats were sticky and the service was poor. There are way better options in the area.</review>

Worst place ever.  The owner is very rude and insulting. She  thinks that everyone she can have. Including women... she is very unpleasant and degrading to her staff. AVOID... The food is nothing special actually very unpleasant like her<//Review>

Sunny's is a classic family restaurant. Thier food is reliably good and everything on thier menu is comfortable. There are no frilly fusion dishes, just the classics and they are done well. The best thing is the kids menu .  It comes with a free prize ticket for your kids to choose from after the meal.  it is a great incentive for good behavior.</text>

Can I say Zero stars? Terrible food...worse than Denny's. Bad coffee. The host and waitress were impersonal, slow and uncaring. Awful lighting as well. I regret my 8% tip out of guilt...should have been less.< /review>

<Review>I would like to give no stars but I first just say dont go here.  I waited 25 minutes and didnt even get a water in front of me.  When I noted to the server she said oh I thought you were still waiting for people.  After that I had to walk up to her while she served guests that just arrived.  Once I made the decision to get up and leave the front desk person yelled at me and my family to "go sit and they would take care of our drinks."  I worked in the service industry for 10 years and have never experienced this type of behavior by anyone or tplace.  This place is a disgrace and should be closed.  Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere ✔< /Review><Time>1521567983683< /Time><pics>None</pics></record>

I asked two of the waitresses and they said they get YELLED at if they try to take their lawful 10 minute break. The air conditioning is basically OFF, and it is sweltering inside as it was hot outside. There are HUNDREDS of places to eat, why would ANYONE choose this crappy run down hole....I will tell everyone I know how poorly this place is run.< /text>< pictures>

We live in long beach. We drive to Sunnys because we know the quality of service is great! The food is delicious.  We never had a meal we didnt like. Tje muffins are good. The pancakes and waffles are really good. They have specials every day.</review>

This review is a little bit late in coming. The first time I walked in to Sunny's, I was about 11yo. In April, I'll be 43. OK, OK, A LOT LATE IN COMING. I thinks that it's difficult to right a fair review when you know people forever, but I'm gonna try.
1) The Food: This isn't the type of restaurant that you see every day (especially anymore). I'll explain. If you order a turkey sandwich, for example, they carve fresh turkey from the birds that they Freshly Roasted that day. Their soups are not "frozen in a bag" they a Freshly crafted by their talented kitchen staff.
This is how all restaurants used to be, or so I've been told.
2)The People: I'll try to be brief. The Zervos family has been in the restaurant business for an incredibly long time. Andy, the patriarch has run numerous restaurants in Orange County, even another Sunnys which used to be in South H.B. The Zervos family and their staff are more than mere restaurateurs. They are the people who remember your name. The ones who ask about family members, when they haven't seen them in too long. They are the people who sent home an order of soup, when they heard I was sick.
To sum it up, Andy, Cindy, their Children, and staff, are like family. It's like eating at your favorite aunt's house. It's being surrounded by people who care, and people you care about in return.
3)The Restaurant: Sunny's just completed a HUGE exterior renovation, and it couldn't look better outside. Haven't seen any noticeable changes inside yet, but I'm Certain that it is only a matter of time before they get to that also. I will be very honest, the interior is significantly dated in appearance. I know that can be a turn off to some people who are looking for the newest hippest spots. This isn't new or hip. It's Classic, a bit dated, and the food, service, and staff, are the BEST that you are likely to find, ANYWHERE in Orange County.< /Text>

I was so disappointed in the food here. It was basically cafeteria quality food and my eggs were not even cooked, the whites were still runny. I told a friend about my experience and she pointed out the restaurant was shut down a few months back for a cockroach issue. I'm totally turned off to trying this restaurant again.<//Review>

The food is terrible, the owner is a extremely unhelpful and rude. When my food wasnt made how I ordered it she acted like she was annoyed, and told me there's nothing she could do about it. If I didn't like it I could go somewhere else. There was also a fly in my ice cube! Disgusting! "You're fired"<//Text>

Walked into the entrance and stood there for at least 5 minutes and no one, no one at all approached us. In fact there wasn't anyone at the counter or register. We stood there long enough to notice the fruit flies crawling all over the chocolate chip cookies in the cookie case though.<//Text>

<Text>This place is the worst you walk into the restaurant and it smells bad
you try to get seated guys watching TV ignoring all the customers waited to be seated what's up with that
guy tells me he's the owner guys a loser anyway the
food was I would give it up 3 out of 10 stars as far as everything else they don't have a place to put - stars on this
Their place is a joke terrible
I'd rather eat at Denny's< /Text>< Pics>

Horrible.  I have stopped in here twice to have breakfast before coming to work and could not get waited on!  The first time took forever.  The second time the waiter walked by me 3 times and ignored me but waited on a couple that had just walked in the door.  I got up and left and told the manager that was the last time I came in this dump.</review>
