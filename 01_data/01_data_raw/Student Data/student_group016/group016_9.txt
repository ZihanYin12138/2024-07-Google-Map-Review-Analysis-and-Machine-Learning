<text>Went here for the shrimp cocktail before and had shocking results tonight. They changed the size of the shrimp or maybe resulting from the pandemic 😷. For $14.85 I don’t think it’s fair. Three stars for taste and service.<//text><date>1611546561918</date><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOegWRCDfTMQ3pgVMr_DNaw8od2zIRtIUtV05U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH-ZkgndqtP1Yq8o-GYtxJEqgRyjHSTXi18_74=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGxtsOZ7403TW25YKsG9JWWYRST7T18rPbfDTs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< gmapID>

Great customer service first of all. They even stopped by our table to check on us to see if everything was ok. You don't see this at all at fast food places.

Food was fantastic. True Mexican taste. I would definitely come here again. The tables were a bit sticky, but we cleaned it up pretty good. Limited seating for such a busy place.

Again, great tasting authentic mexican food in a fast food environment. Check out my channel Simply Tom to see my eating videos here. It's pretty darn good. Food, that is. lol.< /Text>

<Text>Don't know why it takes so long for someone to get their food that's in front of me. Waited 20 minutes so far. While7 cars that have already gone through popeye's chicken place.If there's a large order, that should be done inside. Decided to leave.

Senor Baja had prepared the dough and fillings for us, so there was luckily very little that we could mess up.... and everything tasted amazing!  Senor Baja and Julia are so friendly and knowledgable, and clearly put a lot of thought and effort into their food and menu -- the wine pairings were just as impressive as the food!  We can't wait to go back for dinner.</review>< UserId.>

The fish tacos are plentiful, crunchy and well garnished, very good choice if a Taco Nazo isn't nearby. The included salsa is flavorful with mild heat. Taco Tuesdays make for a reasonably priced weekly meal. Beer would be a much welcomed addition to compliment the menu. Dining area is small and clean. The garnish station is adequate, I like more variety. Despite the off-road racing decor, the TV is tuned to novellas, variety shows and soccer. The staff is nice and orders are filled quickly. Drive thru got my order wrong the only time I've used it, at least they were shrimp tacos; tasted good, but I'm glad I wasn't allergic.</text>

<Review>Terrible service! I ordered a shrimp cocktail to go, and when I got in the car I went to eat some, and there was no avacado!! I went back in to ask for some, and the girl just said oh, we're out. Like why wasn't I told before I ordered? I told her I would not have ordered if I knew, but all she said was sorry. No attempt to make it right or anything. I used to work food service and in this situation I would have definitely given a refund or at least extra shrimp or something. I was really craving a good shrimp cocktail too! Ruined my dinner.</Review><user_id>112275862891397036632<//user_id>< username>

Wow! I stopped here looking for lunch and wanted an easy meal. The drivethru made me think it'd be mediocre fast food. It was not.
I ordered the chiptole mahi mahi fish tacos and it was delicious. There was a bit of a wait, but that's because they made it right there instead of premade heatlamps. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu!< /review>

That was my experience here. The food was mediocre compared to other senor Baja's, but they don't offer sauces which is lame. The service was as expected from people who hate their lives and their job. As if accepting my challenge of "it can't get any worse", I found a hair in my cup and all the tables were sticky. All in all, the employees are awful, the food is below expectation, and the hygene was nonexistent.<//Review>< Pictures>

I don't understand all of the rave reviews. The girls inside were very nice, but the food was seriously lackluster.  We ordered carne asada tacos, and they were not good. Dry and flavorless. I guess everyone has different taste, but if I'm paying $10 for a taco combo, I want some flavor.

This place is not for me. Won't be going back 😕<//Text>

The food is good, but they're super slow and the overall look and cleanliness of the place makes you wonder.</Review>

< review>
I was in there for 30 minutes!!! Two employees with one customer each. I really needed a charger, that’s it! Just a charger. And they didn’t even bother to acknowledge me after the initial greet when I went in. This has got to be the worst customer service I’ve gotten (one that’s non existent). Unbelievable that within 30 minutes you don’t ask at least “Did you have a quick question?” Nothing! It’s not easy for me to go somewhere to buy something like a charger that’s greatly needed. Definitely calling corporate about this.<//review>

This time however, we were assisted by a girl named Stephanie who was very knowledgeable about the products, and made the process so easy. The wait time was not bad like we had expected, and the manager Sabrina even helped with transferring all of our information over to the new phones. The team work was amazing and we are very happy.

<rating>1</rating><Text>Worst customer service ever... Sabrina the manager just talks over you and doesn’t hear what you have to say. She chose not to help me... worst attitude ever waisted my time and didn’t even want to hear me out. From the beginning she knew she couldn’t help me instead wanted to bash me for my late payments. I’ve been with sprint for 15 years and not once have I experienced such bad customer service. Honey I make my payments and honestly now going to look into another service provider.

Just went into the store today to upgrade my phone the wait time was short and I was able to get in and out. The store employees did a good job of making sure the store was clean and sanitized which is appreciated because we are in a pandemic. Sabrina the store manager was especially helpful and made sure all our needs and issues were resolved.< /Review>

<review>This store is temporarily closed until further notice. A sign on the door is directing customers to the mall location and Lancaster location.

Edit: the store has since reopened since my previous review. There is a current occupancy restriction in order to adhere to covid-19 social distancing guidelines. You can check in and they will buzz you via text when it's your turn to come into the store. Wait times vary but it's nice to not have to stand in a line to get in.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Horrible customer service and long wait time!!

1. An associate had us sign in in a digital display that was an advertisement display not a sign in.
2. This associate bypassed us and assisted a couple who came in after us and another family.
3. When his supervisor/manager corrected his mistake, and instructed him to help is who arrived first, he continued to say it was not a good idea, and still continually to help this couple although he was asked to several times by us and his supervisor/manager.
4. The whole time this associate helped me he kept huffing and puffing in dissatisfaction as if he did not want to help me with my transaction.
5. He continued to vent saying how did not work there and how I should go to the Lancaster location "where he normally works" because they could help me better and they had a better stock. I mentioned I had gone to the sprint in Palmdale east and made a face and said oh no, I would never go to that store on the east.
4. As I was already over this visit and wanted nothing to do but leave and never come back I came to the end of finishing my transaction.  I mentioned to him that I did not want any accessories because I had purchased mine on Amazon. He continued to ask "how much did you pay for your cheap oh sorry I did not mean that, how much did you pay for your accessories " I proceeded to tell him that I did not want my any and he started to become pushy asking me to at least spend 90 dollars.

This was beyond the worst experience I have ever had at sprint. I think they need to work on improving their associate customer service skills. I've been a loyal customer and this is the least that could be done. I worked for sprint mobile phone customer service many years ago and never treated anyone like this.</text>< pictures>

Very rude and unprofessional sales people, yelling at us as soon as we walked in, not to move the displayed to the public phones. Then asked for the Manager and the blond goes back to his office and brings him with and tells me tha he said that we can't help you. I'm glad that i didn't change my service to them, all my friends at work said that they were the worst carrier in the valley.< /text>

I was at this sprint store on 11/19/14 and walked in and asked a couple questions about the iPhone 6 plus, the gentleman was very friendly and informative gave me a couple tips on how to go about getting the phone and what would be the better alternative. I appreciated that and saw how sincere he was about what he was telling me and got the phone! He then had a young lady named Veronica help me with the rest of the process and she too was very helpful, respectful, and professional. will definitely be going back to this store for all my other SPRINT needs. A+++ to the staff!!</Text>

2.  The customer service was better this time, but overall the same problems exist.  One hand isn’t talking to the other and both of those hands are held out fo me to pay them...< /Review>< pics>

Found out that I was tricked into signing a lease when i came in to replace my existing owned sprint phone through the insurance i paid for on my account . They took my damaged phone allowing me to believe i was paying the same as insurance (150) but over payments on my bill for the remainder of my contract so that i could get a phone that day instead of the three days it takes the 3rd party insurance. Turns out you pay 500+ for a phone you wont own. Made complaints with bbb and fcc. You can buy here just dont believe your sales person for anything they will lie to your face and steal from you. Make sure to read every detail before you sign not just take the word of your salesperson because you can have proof they mislead you but bottom line is that they have your signiture and will hive you the finger. Worst experience I've ever had ever with a company. My sales person was Victor< /Text>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>Worst sprint store, had rude employees. As I walked in the employee in front desk was on her cell phone, didn't even look at me nor asked for my name to put on the list.  Waited a long time for service on a non-busy day while the employees just walked around talking and on there cell phones. The store manager was not professional. Cinthya E was so rude which I dont know why since it wasnt busy. Never seen so many employees on their cell phones before attending to their customers.Horrible customer service. Worst place to go...</Review>< pictures>

<review>In my opinion Sprint is the worst cell phone company in America they tell you lies on the phone and when you get into their store it's a totally different situation I've had account with Sprint for over 18 years and they treated me like I was a common criminal I just don't recommend Sprint to anyone of course that's my opinion your experience with Sprint maybe totally different from mine but what can I say< /review>< pics>

There is no sprint service on the west side of hywy 14. And they will not give you an airwave unless you have multiple lines. Buyers beware!</Review>

<text>I would like to share that my experience here has been great. A few hiccups in the beginning, which, looking back may have been to adjusting to a new provider. However, I will say that I am satisfied with the care I have received and even more happy that I finally have my acne under control. Great PA and great Staff. I do feel more comfortable addressing any problems that I or my family may have. I do look forward to our established pt/provider relationship.< /text>< Pics>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I paid 150 out of pocket for literally a 5 min conversation with dermatologist Courtney, I believe was her name. I have been struggling with bad acne and i asked her what was she going to do for me today (day of visit). Apparently I am already on all the pills I need to be on to treat my acne and she just said to continue them. No blue light, no cream, no peel NO NOTHING DONE $150 gone wasted on a 5 min CONVO!

$150 for absolutely nothing but just a 5 min chat about what I already know.  5 MIN! Think about that if you are paying out of pocket.

Do yourself a favor don’t waste your time. Awful awful!< /Review>< pics>

Dr. Han is a state-of-the-art dermatologist, A to Z !  She has it all ~

professional and skilled to the greatest degree possible
friendly, warm, compassionate, comforting
on-time appointments
answers all questions thoroughly and patiently
respectful toward her patients
excellent staff at the office ( have also seen dr. mafong for his
specialty surgies, and he too is excellent )
she has been helping me for years with recurring actinic keratoses,
pre-cancerous growths, freezing them off successfully every time
more recently, i inquired about a laceration i had from have my lower
calf gouged with a bicycle pedal.  the scab had been on my leg for
two months.  i asked if that was normal. she suggested that i give
it an 'aquaphor bath' to moisturize the scab so it would come off
sooner.  she showed me how to do it and in less than a week, it
fell off!  would have been many weeks otherwise.  she works magic!!!!

i can't rave about her enough.  if you are looking for a wonderful
dermatologist, please look no further:  she's the ONE!!!!!!!!

I just called to make an appointment for a skin cancer concern, and the receptionist was so rude and unwelcoming that I decided not to even give this place business. This place appears to be a great practice, but I recommend the first impression to be a lot more welcoming and helpful. I have never been to a dermatologist, so a kind and informative reply to my question about if they assess these types of health concerns would have been much more appropriate instead of telling me, "Well yeah. This IS a dermatologist."< /text>

Great place and prices. They honor your appointment, so you don't end up waiting an hour in the waiting room. The waiting room wasn't full and my appointment went by efficiently. I love that you can schedule online it's such a time saver. Did I mention the prices are great?:)</Review>

<Text>Dr Mafong is my go to dermatologist in San Diego. I’ve seen him for a wide range of medical and cosmetic needs and he’s always up front and clear about my options. I also love that he remembers me and personal stuff we talked about the last time I was in, even if that was a year and a half ago. Highly recommend him.</Text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>Receptionist refused to give me a quote on a simple wart removal. I said I needed at least an estimate because I’m a full-time student and I’m paying out-of-pocket and she said no that I would need to pay the doctor $150 first and then he could give me a quote.

I called on Monday afternoon and was able to make an appointment for the next morning. I was a few minutes late to the appointment and they did not give me a hard time for that. While I was waiting to be called back, I received an email that they already registered me on their online patient portal, which is where I can access all of my documents. They called me back in a timely manner. I saw their PA and she was so helpful and wasn’t bothered by all the questions I had. Great experience, highly recommend.<//Review>

Dr.Han was wonderful. I hadn’t seen a dermatologist in several years and was worried that I may have some form of skin cancer with a few spots on my hands.  I was a new patient and she walked in and looked at my hands and gave me an exam immediately.  I wanted a no nonsense exam and honest so I was so happy with her as my new dermatologist. I just need an annual exam!  I would recommend her to everyone!👍🏻</Text>

<review>Erika is very knowledgeable about dermatology and skincare. She listens to my concerns and provided her recommendations on my treatment goals. I work with the public and being confident about my skin is important. Erika’s skill and training make her the ideal asset in putting your best face forward. I highly recommend her.</review>< Pics>

<text>As a new patient I felt welcome here. The receptionist as well as the medical assistants were friendly. The doctors assistant did a thorough check of my past medical history and current medications prior to seeing Doctor Willoughby. The doctor looked over my skin condition and discussed a plan to alleviate the problem. I was very pleased with my first visit so I would recommend this clinic to others.</text></record></dataset><record>

I had dreaded making a dermatology appointment because I remembered it taking months to get into my previous one. Since I'm not from San Diego I didn't have a dermatologist and lucked out finding them on Google! I was able to get in within a few days. They were great and made sure to answer all of my questions. I definitely recommend them!< /review>

As Good as it Gets.
Dr. Willoughby is 2 for. 2 with me so far and is among the very best physicians I've met in 19 years in San Diego. A persistent lump on the forehead following a minor trauma stumped my  primary care, urgent care and ER staff. In about a minute he diagnosed a cyst that requires excision - scheduled next week. . Friendly, smart and confident< /text>

<text>Dr. Amy Han is an angel. She’s always in a pleasant mood and never makes me feel rushed. Most importantly, she worked so hard for me when I battled with my insurance to get a medication approved. Today I was scheduled for 11:30 and their notifications somehow didn’t reach me that stated she need to leave at 11:30. She took me anyhow! I can’t sing her praises enough. A truly wonderful person ❤️<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>Dr. Han is amazing. I have been to many dermatologists in San Diego trying to figure out how to get rid of a skin problem that has plaguing me for years. She was the first doctor to actually touch and closely examine the area affected and offer some possible solutions. Every other doctor has seemed stumped. She unfortunately doesn’t take my insurance, but I am willing to pay her very reasonable fees out-of—pocket because I trust her far more than any of the doctors on my plan. I highly recommend Dr. Han.< /Text>< resp>

My son has the mole in the middle of his forehead, it turns worse these days. We are very worried about that. Dr. Mafong is informative and warm. The sentence he said” if he is my son, I would...” calms me down. In addition, I’m self-pay, today is my first visit, they did not ask me pay a penny. Look forward to two weeks later check, hope everything goes well.< /Text>

<Text>If you're looking for a dermatologist that's direct and to the point, this is your place!

This is the second year I've been seeing Dr. Mark Willoughby. He's always been candid and clear-cut with his expertise, and his recommendations.

PROPS: My time is important to me, and I appreciate having an office that can quickly and clearly explain what they need to tell you.
SLOPS: While they're working to update their processes, this is still an old school doctor's office. For example, they've transitioned to use email to verify your appointment instead of a phone call.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Dr. Willoughby was very helpful in all aspects of my skincare needs. I trust his advice and recommendations and will refer him to others.< /review>

I absolutely love Dr. Willoughby! I am very insecure about my psoriasis and when he looks at my skin, he doesn’t give me a look of disgust. Which I assume is normal because he is a dermatologist but either way, he makes me feel like it’s ok. Front desk is nice and friendly and so are the nurses/ assistants. I’ve told all my friends about him and I always refer him. Great doctor!</review>

Very efficient in setting appointment within reasonable time. When I showed up for appointment was seen within 5 minutes. I had records sent from another provider to Dr. Mahfong. My records were reviewed timely and my consult for Mohs resulted in appointment for the surgery in two weeks. All to my satisfaction. I plan to have all my future dermatology requirements with Dr. Mahfong at this Hillcrest location.< /review>

Great experience overall, front staff was pleasant and helpful, Dr. Han listens to your concerns and makes you feel comfortable.  I would recommend going a few minutes early as the underground parking lot is full at most times.< /Text>

I met with Erica who I first thought was super nice. I saw her twice to help me deal with a rash and the second time she set me up with a cortisone prescription. I spent a good deal of time ensuring that this prescription could be renewed, for my health insurance coverage was ending and I cannot afford another visit AND prescription without coverage. She ensured me this would definitely fine and that I could renew as needed.

Several weeks later, my prescription is out and she refuses to let me renew it without paying out of pocket for an office visit. What a scam. So now I am stuck with a rash so painful that walking hurts and I wasted my coverage visiting them and setting up refills so I can't go to anyone else.< /review><Date>1490038271896<//Date><resp>None<//resp><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

< Review>
Do not waste your time, money or effort at ANY office overseen by Dr. Mark A Willouhby. His admin staff is rude and unaware of payment policies advised by their own advising staff.
Dr. Willoughby himself did not take the time to properly assess my scar, misdiagnosing a hypertrophic scar as a keloid scar simply because of the melanin in my skin.
His practicing staff injected me with the wrong dosage of Kenalog shots and Dr. Willoughby's only advise was to come more often and spend more money. Much of the clients who are seen at this office are older patients who might over look these details more easily.
Save your time and look elsewhere.< /Review>

I've been here a couple times here and there. The experience is always pleasurable. Neve had an issues with any of the employees. If they don't have what you're looking for, they'll try to work something out with you. It gets really hectic but they are never rude. It's my go to place for quick stops.<//text>

<Text>Went in to look for a used battery -- younger Latino guy was extremely friendly, but the older Armenian customer service was bad, tried to force me to take a battery that was not the correct size and then got irritated that I did not want to take it.

I cannot recommend these guys highly enough. No-nonsense, handshake kinda guys, they were able to help me out with more professionalism than a dealership at a lower price. Tristar auto parts is the best!</review>

TURN AROUND NOW DO NOT buy anything from these people saving a couple bucks or so is not worthy very inconvenient with removing the defective junk parts especially if you only have one car your stuck not able to go to work etc. They are very rude and very disrespectful, they will hung while you are still talking they will gang out on you and tried to intimidate you if you are a woman. WORST PLACE EVER if you don't believe me go ahead and return something see it for yourself.

May 2018 I purchased a radiator I was told it was brand new to make long story short the radiator cap was not compatible after months of replacing caps and refilling coolants I decided it's enought for the headache.
October 2018 I asked to exchanged for another one due to their product was defective, they will try to blame you first or your mechanics, make up some excuses to avoid return or exchange. To make long story short they agreed but I was told that it will be more expensive because its a better quality.
So I had to pay more for the exchanged and my mechanic again just to removed their junk parts and replaced, after a week of driving I noticed something was leaking to make long story short again we found out the small part that connects from radiator to transmission oil was leaking " axel transmission connections" won't tightning up so I told my mechanic to removed it and I took it back to Tri star Oh! Let me tell you I was accused of breaking it or my mechanic did not know what he was doing and I was told to put a thread or some kinda tape, I said just give another parts so I can replace it still under warranty I was pretty much told they can't do it they were pointing fingers at each other "like"ask him or ask the owner. I end up taking video with the whole thing which I will use to complain at BBB, they were screaming I was told I talked too much it was pretty bad BELIEVE me.

BAD EXPERIENCE. DO NOT SUPPORT!. EXTREMELY RUDE!< /Text>

<Review>Absolutely over the top reviews. Parts are more expensive than other places close to double. You can't return unused part unless they charge you 20% restocking fee.

I was in heaven in this store. Very small! Formerly the Noise Noise Noise from my days. Same owner. Nice guy.  Standing room only. Very accommodating with covid restrictions making sure any customer got the desired experience. So much vinyl, tapes, other merchandise. Digital vinyl but certainly more analog  which is my speed. Prices fair. Condition to purchase price for used items I felt was fair too. Will absolutely  100% be returning.< /Review>

Pretty good selection for being a small store. Found a couple great original pressings. The guy running the place was very nice and helped me search for particular albums. Only complaint if I could say anything negative is that many of their bins were jammed tight with records which made searching more difficult than usual. I guess that's better than not having a good selection. I'll be back soon.</Text>

Tightly packed, micro store with a lot of uncommon vinyl in really good condition. Friendly and knowledgable staff. The store is very small though and only a couple people can fit in there at a time so you may need to take turns getting in and out. Lots of great finds in there and it is really worth the stop if you are in the neighborhood. They have a little of everything, including some great local bands. The prices were good and the vinyl was well worth the purchase price. Cool place with an old school feel. One of the best hole in the wall shops I have been to.</Text>

If you're looking for jazz, new wave, rock, metal, punk, industrial, goth on vinyl, Dave's record store is the place to get it. He's been in business forever, so go check him out.<//review>

This is my fav record store hands down. Dave the owner is a pleasure to talk to and ask questions.  It's a small place with an amazing selection of gems and things you want...bot your uncles old dusty collection. Constantly adding and switching out talking with posting new finds on line. I travel over an hour from Hollywood and always leave happy.</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Cramped, fun little weird place.  It's in the back of the shopping center it's in so you can't see it from the street.  They always have a great selection with prices going from way low ($5) to what you would expect for rarities ($100s).  I always find a Nirvana bootleg to add to the collection.  Doesn't cater to one genre, plenty of everything.

Great, great place.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

Great little shop.....this place has mostly used stuff at good prices...I did score some new Prince Jammy Dub, and some Minor Threat....holds a eclectic section of music, the dude behind counter totally kills it. I spent WAY to much money there, but nothing beats DUB on vinyl.</Text>

It's a small place (>200 sqft), but packed with records. They are reasonably well organized for the type of place, but you still have to dig a bit. The prices vary from $~4 for poor quality to $~20 for good and on up.

You can definately walk out of here with a handful of records for under 30 bucks.< /text>

Overpriced vinyls, the owner he is a cool dude and has a great selection of vinyls but unfortunately everything is overpriced. If you have a vinyl you're looking for, more than likely he'll have it.  Check this place out.</text>

<Review>This place has been the vet for my parents pets 30+ years. I've grown up and become a vet myself practicing in another state.  I had an incident while visiting my parents where my puppy ate poison berries in the backyard and Pleasanton Vet was able to squeeze him in to what I'm sure was a full schedule and able to induce vomiting and get the berries back up. This practice has always come through when we have needed them. Excellent place to take your pet.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808fe9638c93690b:0xbdd987aa89337c88</gmap_id>< pics>

Love bringing my golden retriever clutch here. They are very professional and when treating him they break it all down on what they are giving him and cost per and total. Allowing me to make informed decisions. Highly recommend Dr. Shapiro for your pets</Review>

This vet hospital is a cut above and does an outstanding job. The staff is kind and friendly and up to any task. My dog and I are heading to the Big Island. The doctor taking care of my dog knew all the ins and out of traveling to Hawaii, many doctors don’t know this. It is not straight forward and someone in the know really helps and for this I am incredibly grateful.</text>

Had my first appointment here on Monday at 8:30am. They were prompt and took Murphy in as soon as I arrived. Dr. Shapiro was very patient and took the time to answer all of my questions. I'm very happy to have found a veterinary hospital I feel really good about taking Murphy too.<//Text>

Hāna had to go in a few days ago presenting a great deal of pain. I was beyond concerned! But thanks to the incredible Dr. And staff I was quickly brought to ease. They were able to find the source of pain and get her back on the path to being a happy healthy pet again! I don't know what I would do without them! A big special thanks to Cynthia  for always bringing a smile to my face and a sense comfort to Hāna while she stayed there as well as being able to accommodate me in such short notice. You all are amazing! Now my little girl is resting comfortably thanks to Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital< /text>

<review>My wife Kendall and I took our cat here to be checked out. She keeps scratching her ear and we don't know why (and still don't know why). Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital, without actually seeing our cat prescribed a variety of medications and put her on a diet trial for 3 months and insisted she be in a cone for that duration of time. When asked to bring our cat in, they refused to examine our cat, claiming she was swiping at them, even though they also said they never took her out of the cat carrier to begin with (there was no way she could have gotten her paw through the holes in the cat carrier). They prescribed Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant medication claiming this would stop her from swiping at them in future visits and were gracious enough to charge us for it. Our cat was calm and fine going to and from the vet and is by nature and extremely friendly cat who sits in peoples laps when she meets them and we have never had this kind of issue with any other vet. We gave our cat this medication as prescribed, as well as daily dosages of Prednisolone (a steroid) and an anxiety medication and brought her back to the vet. They said she was still swiping at them (still having never taken her out of the cat carrier) and refused to examine our cat, told us to keep our cat in a cone and keep her on a diet trial for another 3 months while charging us for these visits and still having not examined or cat to see if this is even warranted. They graciously charged us for an examination both times without examining our cat and without providing any possible solutions other than long term medication, change of diet and continuous wearing of a cone. When told we would be soliciting a second opinion, they were very quick to give us our cat back without any pleasantries. I do not recommend this vet.<//review>< Pics>

< review>
I went to a 24 hour veterinary hospital in Dublin, CA, for a year. I left when my "Rosita" was taken from me by a heartless, nonchalant, rude, non empathetic human being.
I thought I would never own another dog. Rosita's death shattered most of my heart. She was my "Emotional Support Therapy" dog and she loved me as much as I loved her.
After a few months of crying, sleeping and isolation, I decided to look online at the animal shelter in Dublin.
I was scanning pictures of the potential adoptees and my finger stopped. There she was, this cute, little imp of a face, with ears laid back. That was it!! She was staring back at me, with tiny, black eyes, yearning for her "forever" home.
I immediately called the shelter and asked if this sweet precious was still available for adoption. She was!!!
I jumped out of bed, got dressed and was there, faster than "greased lightening"!!
I was waiting in the yard, and one of the attendants opened the door. There she was, running on her leash like a banshee.
I picked her up and she curled up in my lap. I was a goner for this sweet girl. Turned out, she's a "Senior", just like me, with two, rather large, bald spots and a few, rotten teeth.
She received a vet check and I was told she is a "Chinese Crested" and ??? else.
It really was "love at first sight"!!!
I was on the hunt for a new doctor for "Miss Molly". We both decided that "Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital" would be our medical, grooming, nutritional facility.
The administrative employees, vet techs and veterinarians are ALL caring, knowledgeable, empathetic and kind. We've ALWAYS been treated like family and Miss Molly is always calm and collected, when we are there.
We are both very happy to recommend "Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital" for your animals' medical, grooming and nutritional needs.</review>

<Review>they’re super great with birds (i’m unsure about dogs because i don’t have one but i’m sure they’re awesome with them as well.) i bring my cockatiel here and she’s handled well each time. she had an eye infection and they took her in that next morning, flushed her eye out, talked me through it, gave me eye drops for her, and now she’s good as new within a day. Dr. Edelman cares about the animals brought in and does a good job giving information on what foods, care, and other things birds need in their lives. she has always been eager to help and educate me. will be going here forever for my bird.</Review></record>

I didnt get to enter the business because of Covid19,  I did like and appreciate Dr. Shapiro, she was thorough and explained everything in detail very professional,  then called back the next day to inquire about my precious fur baby,and gave me additional test results with care options. Overall I feel very satisfied with Dr. Shapiro and the expertise.</Text>

Took my fractious cat in for an exam. By the end of the whole thing (despite giving them ample warning), I was told not to bring him back. I was also told not to bother getting his vaccinations moving forward because he is so difficult to handle. We went to the SPCA following this appointment and they managed just fine.

DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE. They only care for easy animals. Not challenging rescues. ZERO compassion.</text>

The hair dressers are rude and abrasive at times. The lady that is right next to the front door is very rude among others.Kim also..Very rude. A lot of them speak another language to each other which I find disrespectful. However I have found a good hair dresser there..her name is Hannah..very good and professional! Good job Hannah! Keep up the good work. You deserve it!</review>

< review>
Our small dog, a Bichon Havanese, has received care from the people at Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital for all of his now nearly 15 years. From routine things like microchip and inoculation, more (ahem) life changing things like neutering, occasional emergencies like his sprained neck, to the tooth cleaning and extraction of his more senior years, we have always appreciated the kindness and care of the people there.<//review>

This place is awesome! Dr. E is amazing with my dogs, he really takes the time to make them feel comfortable and show them some love before anything else. He explains everything so thoroughly and doesn't make you feel rushed. The other vets here are great as well, I just can't remember their names, but they have seen my animals, too. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a vet in the tri-valley.<//Review>

We went to Pleasanton Vet Hospital to have our beloved kitty put to sleep. It was relatively urgent and our usual vet was not available. Everyone was incredibly helpful and caring. We are switching to them for all of our other pets.< /Text>

This hospital preformed several extractions and blood tests, follow up appointments...and somehow missed that my cat wasn't healing. The underlying cause (which they should have caught) caused his death and their negligence caused him additional pain. Please don't make the same mistake I did by taking your fur baby to this facility.</text>

< Review>
If only all businesses had such nice people! Here it is affordable and the service is very caring. I was so frustrated with other vets I dealt with in South San Jose and Palo Alto. The other vets had no empathy and they wanted to charge an arm and a leg, pushing for same day surgery of the wrong limb, and not answering my questions stating that they will answer it next time or the next specialist will answer the questions. With the care I've had so far here, I do not regret the 1 hr drive. Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital has called back to answer questions and followup on concerns regarding the surgery. I will recommend this vet hospital 100% to anyone I know. So far so very worth it!!!<//Review>

<review>This place had a relaxing atmosphere, chill people, and a hardworking bartender Friday night. Asked for the Fish and Chips for only $5.99 thinking it was going to be small but it was pretty big; definitely a plus. Found out the bartender was working by herself so she had to make drinks AND cook our food. Kinda ridiculous and felt bad about it. Had I known she was also making our food before I signed my tip I would have given her more. Cool place though - check it out.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNBNf__7T2dkwGusTcHCv2QEVeclVf3LhqlHcR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Yesterday I went for the first time to Dublin's. I never felt like going before because some people had told me bad things about it. I wanted to give it a try though. The only thing I got was bad service. Both clerks were drunk, you could clearly smell it in their breath and in the way they were serving costumers. I wanted to go to the bathroom before ordering, and in my way there I was approached by a guy I honestly thought wanted to pick up a fight, but no.. I later learned he was one of the bartenders. He grabbed me by the arm and pushed me out of the bathroom hallway asking for my id. I understand that bars can get a big fine for not checking IDs, but that's not the way of handling the situation. I pulled out my ID while I was being dragged out of the bar, and told him that he was not practicing good customer service. He just smiled and laughed at everything I was saying. I realized he was drunk and there was no point in reasoning with him, so I took my friends and left. On the way out, people were asking why we were leaving and started complaining too. I'm not going back to this bar again.<//Review>

My go to bar in IV. Fun atmosphere, dimly lit as I like them, cheap drinks and a nice little patio to sit and get some air. I like their music too!</text>

Used the automatic no touch. Not bad, though it seemed like some parts of the ultimate wash were lacking like if the solution levels were low. All in all it did a good job and I did not have to remove my roof rack or bike rack. It did struggle with some small spots of 2 week old bird gifts but what wash doesn't.< /Review>

First time i used it and i am amazed,  this place and it is the best, the self serve machine  it does have a lot of fixtures  to be able to was your car or pick up. Also have a automatic machine to wash you vehicle if you don't want to do it yourself.</review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>I passed by this car wash and was intrigued with the touch less wash... after getting home believing i left that place with a nice shinny clean car after getting the “upgraded deal” with alI the cool stuff especially the spotless water I was willing to go back for another wash when I needed to, But when I got home and seen what I was driving around for the last 10 minutes i was very disappointed. I had to get myself supplies to remove the spots and rewash my car. If you own a black car don’t us the touch less one. Stick to the hand washing and waxing cause places like this will do more harm to your cars paint then doing it good. Only took a few photos but you get the point after jus a few and you don’t want to see the back bumper. I know I myself would be an embarrassed owner of this location having customers leaving my services they pay for in the style I left in. Hopefully this owner steps it up for his customers, if this equipment isn’t up to par let’s hope there are timely upgrades at least.<//Review><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80dcdbe63f81b595:0x60e24aa34b0f8d05< /gmap_id>< userid>

$2.50 for 4 minutes or $5 for 10min self serve wash (can use atm card!) Decent wash. Vacuums are terrible though. ($1) 4 mins I think.< /text>

<Review>Automatic car wash stopped mid way and broke down. As well as almost cracked my passenger review mirror. No type of phone number left anywhere at car wash or online website to contact about incident or to request a refund for incomplete wash.<//Review>< pics>

Price is 2$ to start but if you put 5$ you get 2 minutes extra has a vacuum area and a dog wash station as well .This place also contains a auto carwash so you won't do it yourself<//Review>

<name>Patrick McCarthy< /name><Date>1518814942623<//Date><rate>2< /rate><review>I hope you like water spots, because that’s what you’re going to get here. My car actually looks dirtier than it did when I arrived because of all the white mineral spots on every inch of the paint. I attempted to use the blow-dry nozzle to get the excess water off, but it was basically non-functional. Imagine trying to dry your whole car with a hair dryer on the low setting — it’s like that. I won’t be returning to this location.<//review>< pictures>

Good value overall. There are only two coin op car washes in Tustin/North Irvine area: these guys and the guys down the road. This one is cleaner, have better amenity, has a dog wash station, and got bigger lot but at more cost compared to the other one. This place is always lit well 24/7, there is less need to worry about being robbed or something. My complaint is that when used credit card, the $5/10min option is chosen automatically with no way of changing at all. Bring cash if you want their regular option. There is a blower-dryer option, but I don't feel like it's a very good one and you're probably better off just using your own towels to wipe the car. I'd still pick this car wash over any gas station car washes which are just plain rip offs at least the ones I saw in Irvine.<//text>

< review>
The shops are well maintained, but...
While I was at CVS I witnessed several young women, harassing an elderly woman inside the store.  I was shocked at what I saw...
Two of the ladies working at the checkstsnd ignored what they were watching.  And when the manager was called, he basically did nothing to assure this person who was being victimized that anything world be done, let alone make her feel safe.
I will take my business elsewhere in the future.< /review>

<review>The parking lot is an absolute joke. Twenty minutes just to get out of my spot, are you KIDDING me?!

They're going to need a flagger or something like that so the idiot drivers can learn how to work with the ridiculous parking design the morons who designed this disaster created.<//review>< pictures>

Not cheap, but I still use this service. When I began to go to this car wash it was $7. I gave the very nice and very hard working guys a $10, so they got a $3 tip. Today it's $16 and I give the guys a $20, so they get a little bigger tip. My cost has risen 100%. I do still use this car wash, but as it continues to go up in price, I will have to wash my car at home. Sorry guys.<//Review>

<Review>Can't recommend this car wash. Over priced and a very limited time for self washing and vacuuming. Vacuums don't display how much time is left and if it shuts off you have to pay 2.25 again to start again. 2.25 gets you about 5 mins it seems. You can add time to wash and vac of course but it adds up quick $$$
Also, pools of oily water and generally dirty pavement. Better off going down the street.< /Review>< Response>

Lost money when the vacuum would not work after depositing $2.25.  No one is one site to help fix or refund the money.< /review>

I used my credit card swipe to wash my car.  I only used it for $3.75.  They charged me $15 when I reviewed my bank statement. Watch this business and report it.  They are stealing from people.< /Review>

Careful attentive service. Friendly helpful attendants. Kind of pricy but not too much for a hand wash and dry plus touchless wash.< /review>

<Text>i like the convienence of washing my own car and taxis..generally, there is always the choice of the do it yourself or the employees that wash your car while you sit in your vehicle and the price is lower than the competition's in Sonoma..They do a good job and i like that i can get in and out quickly, either way..</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I did not have an appointment but just drove in as I saw the business from the street and figured i would take a chance.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 2 PM.  It was my lucky day.  They had just finished with a customer and had an open slot.  John was very professional and I was able to use the coupon offered.  Very good will go back to this place again.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Super friendly! Was honest with us before we did our smog test that it wasn’t going to pass, so we didn’t have to pay twice. Helped us find someone that could fix the issue and then finally did the smog test when we knew it would! Highly recommend good and honest prices.<//review><UserId.>104794391008637253509< /UserId.>< name>

This is my fourth Smog Certificate from John.  He is competitively priced, considerate and thorough.  They keep things strictly legal, while doing their best to guide a customer through to legitimately passing a Smog test.  When I failed a Smog test, he offered to check with his OBD sensor to avoid another failed test service charge. If you know you are going to fail but need to know why, it is better to let John know you will be needing two tests.  The first to get the list of items that you will take to your mechanic to repair so your mechanic doesn't have to charge you for their full diagnostic that may be thorough, but not a necessary list to passing your car's Smog test, and the second that will pass once those repairs are completed.  The Smog test process can be frustrating and expensive but having someone like John that is fair and considerate gets you through it with as little running around in circles spending money on mechanics and tests as possible.<//Text>

I politely asked the technician if they were still honoring their $29.99 coupon price as posted on their website. He said yes, but his partner seemed a little upset that I did not “print” out the coupon and did a small rant about how they were losing money.

Let’s be honest, it’s just a piece of paper. The majority of customers will see $29.99 as their advertising. In fact the “real” price, $60, isn’t posted anywhere on the website.

As a business they’re completely free to change their  price upfront, but never hassle a customer about your business operation finances. Price wasn’t even a consideration in my visit, service quality was. I was honestly asking for what price I was supposed to pay.

This is unacceptable behavior considering that other customer reviews did the exact same thing, the only difference was the car we drove. The car someone drives should not be a factor in customer treatment, regardless of how rare or common it is.

Update 1/17/2020 I’m not accusing this place. But I recently noticed unusual bank activity. Seeing that this is the only place in the last month I’ve used my bank card (they take the card to copy down information instead of swiping), I’d advise everyone to monitor their accounts. For Waba restaurants, Starbucks and Lyft.</review><time>1610939431925<//time>< Pictures>

Excellent service.  Upfront on cost.  My regular place was closed for lunch so as I was driving around, I saw this place and pulled in.  The staff were friendly and helped take my car right away.  I was very satisfied with the service and even brought a second vehicle back the following week.< /Review>

<review>Fast service! They took my car right away & had me all fixed up with the smog test I needed for my DMV registration. They even send the report for you. So easy & reasonably priced. If you need anything else for your car, John knows where to send you. He is very helpful & goes out of his way to make sure you get the service you need. Thanks, John, we'll be back.</review></record>

Great service!  They were quick and affordable. I took 3 of my cars there on one day.  One car did not pass, but they provided me the info to get corrected.  It was a simple fix and they retested it the same day.<//Text>

< Review>
Received a letter from DMV that my renewal was incomplete and needed a smog check. I was rushing to find a good smog place with affordable prices. I came across this place and was assisted by John. He was very friendly and was able to accommodate me right away. Car service and customer service was great! Will be back again</Review>

<text>This place is great! I called ahead to see if an appointment was needed and the shop let me know they were free. Once I got there John was able to help me right away. This is my second time bringing my car in and I highly recommend it! Everyone was very professional and I was out of there in less than 15 minutes!</text>< rate>

Best place to get a smog check. There is a gas station near by so you can get food and drinks while you wait but you barely have to wait. Extremely fast and helpful. Thank you!</Review>

Jon was the best!!!! He was so nice, even when an angry german lady was telling at him for 15 minutes. I'm telling you the man did not break, it was smiling all the way! I have to respect someone who can bring that much joy during such an annoying transaction. They were just the greatest and smog checked my car perfectly in record time! Thank you guys!!!< /Text>

< Review>
FAST, GREAT PRICE, & CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called ahead to make sure they allowed walk-ins, and the minute I showed up they got my car in for smog—took less than 5 minutes! Everyone was extremely kind & they immediately gave me somewhere to sit where I could watch them do their work—they do honest, quick work. The gentleman commented on the cleanliness of my interior and was talking me through the process. They finished in about 5-10 minutes, it only cost, about $20.00-$25.00 with their online coupon, AND they asked to spray disinfect my car for me when they finished. Great COVID precautions, and overall a great business. I would definitely make the 45 minute drive again, JUST to smog my car with them!< /Review>

Quick, professional, and courteous. No waiting, even without an appointment. They took good care of my car, and the price was very competitive with the coupon. Just pulled over, and they completed all the checks while we chatted a bit. This was my first visit, and I think I will be coming back.< /text>

I recommended this place to anyone looking to get a Smog check. John gave me a great deal, I called so many smog certified places to try to get a better price and this was the only place with the best deals in town. Don’t waste your time calling around like i did. Call SMOG CHECK ESCONDIDO TODAY!</Text>

I have taken 3 cars to be smog checked to this business.  Service is very fast, professional and friendly. I have never had to wait to be served. There is plenty of parking and it is easy to locate. Prices vary depending on the year and type of vehicle but they are very reasonable and have saved me money. I highly recommend Smog Check Escondido.< /text>

Came in for a smog check, service was fast and the people working in there were very kind and polite. They asked us if we have a coupon which we don’t and told them it was our first time to visit them and just like that; they gave us a $20 coupon. They were particularly attentive to detail too that they pointed out that we needed to have our van serviced due to an airbag recall. I recommend this business for any of your smog check needs.<//text>

I then went to John and Les and they took me in "NO QUESTIONS ASKED"! Very polite, Professional, even had a conversation with me, and treated me like family. Got my truck done in no time. You will have my business from now on and I will refer you out  to friends and family :)

<text>They were very helpful with explaining what I needed to do before a smog check. They were respectful, kind, and very knowledgable. I always go to this place even if there are a couple cars ahead of me because they are fast, diligent, and persistent. I highly recommend going here for a smog check!

Today I realized that I was running out of time to get a RV smog check done. At the last minute I called and was a able to speak to John and he made an adjustment in his schedule to fit us in. I arrived and was greeted by John and his smog tech, we were in and out in no time. These guys are very professional and priced very fair.  Thank you John for your help today.<//Review>

They even had a mechanic friend from the shop next door take the time to install my rear window wipers.  Excellent service.  I will definitely recommend them and use them again.</Review>< time>

I had my appointment at 1PM and was out of there by 1:15PM. I will be going back in the future and recommending it to my family and friends.<//Review>< Pictures>

I googled places to get a smog check and happened to come across this place (the 4.8 rating got my attention right away). The owner was so sweet and very personable. The smog check took no longer than 10 minutes. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends/family and will be back once I need to get another smog check. Highly recommend!!< /review>

I went here after the DMV told me I had to get a completely unnecessary smog certificate for a brand new vehicle. They didn’t have any garage bays available and were working on an RV that was taking a long time to complete so they had me pull up along side and they pulled the tools outside the garage to do the test on my car. I was in and out within 20 minutes with all paperwork in hand. The mechanics were all friendly and observed proper COVID protocol. I was very happy with the service and would go back if the need arises.<//text>

<Text>I personally highly recommend this business. They have excellent rates and friendly service. My car initially didn’t pass and they said run it and come back. Every time I came back they new exactly who I was, gave me no problems. Finally the 3rd time I came back my car passed. Thank you so much John for your professionalism.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Never Go To This Station SUCK Service !!!!! :(  Horrible & negative customer service. I wouldn't recommend especially since there are so many other Smog stations available in the area. Customer service means providing assistance, not inflicting personal judgment nor opinions. Rude entitled acts won't go far in the world of business.<//Review>

It was a very quick smog check and honest one. My car work was done with in 15 minutes. I highly recommend, as they are efficient and do not try to sell any extras.</review>

They were very quick to serve, no hiccups, I didn't even know what I was doing but they were able to help me out pretty easy, and they're definitely cheaper than the rest of the smog places, 10/10 would recommend, GG<//text>

The owner is friendly and loves to talk, which help the time go by even quicker.

We’ll continue to use this shop in the future.<//text>< pics>

I found an online coupon, but couldn't print ot out due to technical issues on my end. I asked if I could use a screen-shot of the coupon and he gladly took it. Its a small shop, but they were fast, efficient, and very friendly. I will definitely come back any time I need a smog.<//Text>< Pics>

They don't deserve even one star. I drove 10 miles to their location with a Groupon for the smog service. They refused to honor the coupon. They are frauds, liars, and cheats. DO NOT USE THEIR BUSINESS FOR ANYTHING. If you do, you will be very sorry.<//Text>

Extremely friendly and professional owner and staff.  Clean shop!  I brought a Groupon to use but the owner explained that he cancelled future Groupons because of customers not reading the fine print and being nasty to him about the standard DMV charge adders.  I was nice and told him I totally understand.  He said he would honor the Groupon price because I was understanding.  Bottom line: be nice and he'll take care of you.< /Text>

I have a 2015 Nissan Sentra. Assumed they would charge me the going rate, which is $30 or $40 - they charged me $60. I guess since I had out of state plates, they assumed I wouldn't know what the price is supposed to be.</review>

John from Smog Check Esco was great! They had canceled their account with Groupon due to Groupon not providing enough info to customers and causing confusion on pricing. I was never notified from Groupon. John apologized, explained the issues, and offered me a discount to best accommodate me. I appreciate that! Definitely recommend</text>

Terrible. Bought a Groupon and they refused to honor it. I showed him that the Groupon had not expired and he still would not do the smog. Not my fault their machine broke. Will never get service here or with Groupon ever again.< /Text>

The guy is fraud. he falsely Advertised on groupon but when I went there he did not honor the groupon and said he will match it. I waited for 20 min and finally my turn came,  he ended up giving the prize of $50 which is the standard price.

please do not go to fraud  smog check escondido. Fraud! Fraud! Fraud!</Review>

I bought a Groupon for Smog Check Escondido to get my smog check done. The gentlemen were very friendly, courteous (held my drink while I got out of the car), and quick. My Groupon was accepted without an issue. We joked around while I waited for them to complete the check. I would definitely recommend this business for your smog check needs!< /Review>

I sat and waited for my Dodge Journey to be smogged.  As I waited,  he asked me if I would like some water.  I had a coupon that was good for a regular vehicle to be smogged.  Because my car was an SUV, he had to charge more.  However, he decided he wouldn't charge me the extra fee.  The service was great and you can't beat the price (even if you don't have a coupon).<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The service is fast. The bad thing is that your coupons are pure hook. I arrived with a discount coupon to the establishment and before I asked something they had already connected my car to their machines. Now when I ask about the promotion. The owner left me with an account that sums the same that they charge, there was nothing discount

(Original)
El servicio es rapido. Lo malo es que sus cupones son puro gancho. Llegue con un cupon de descuento al establecimiento y antes que preguntara algo ya  habian conectado mi carro a sus maquinas. Ya para cuando pregunte hacerca de la promocion. El dueño me salio con una cuenta que sumo lo mismo que cobran, de descuento no hubo nada</text>
