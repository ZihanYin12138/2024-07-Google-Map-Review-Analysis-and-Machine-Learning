First time here and will definitely not be the last. Definitely a community gathering place. They have some great beer on tap with boots! I had the potato apple sauce, pork sausage sauerkraut mashed potatoes, beef with cranberry sauce and red radish. Everything was very delicious although unique for me since I hardly ever eat German food, but it was very tasty and a good change of pace. This is a good place to take friends and dates if you're looking for a solid place to eat and drink.< /Text>

<Time>1610963489453</Time><rate>4<//rate><Text>Ms Ruby's Bakery forever! What is better than fresh plump noodles with butter, cheese and onions? Nothing, that's what. I've been told that the meaty meals are delicious and authentic too, but give me all the noodles with the side of beets and carrot. The dense bread given out is also really good with the dill butter. So much butter everywhere. The beer selection is excellent as well. This is a great place for groups of 4 or more, but not great for a date. It gets loud, and you have to share a table. Do as the Germans do and talk to strangers! Or just sit uncomfortably next to people you don't know and hope they don't ask you to take a picture of them eating their food.< /Text>< Pics>

Finally tried this place! I live just down the street and have always wanted to check it out but it's so under the radar I've forgotten. Walking in it's super packed with tables and chairs and it feels like a true home atmosphere. Proportions are huge and the price is about right for what you pay for. Be sure to get beer to complete your meal. Definitely comfort food for a chill date night<//Review>

Well, I withdrew my cake from the competition because it was not the Ms. Ruby's Red Velvet Cake I fell in love with years ago. I used to LOVE it... it was magical!!! But this cake missed the mark. I'm hoping that is was just an off day. The red velvet cake was just ok, not what it should have been.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I celebrated my birthday earlier this evening in this gorgeous place. I am glad to say that we passed a incredible evening and the place was evidently the reason for the successful event. The stuff  contributed in a sweet way, the meals were extremely good and my guests were so  cheerful. We shall surely visit again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Ms Ruby's Bakery: I stopped in for a quick lunch and was genuinely surprised by the prices. You can get a burger, fries and drink for $7. The burgers are greasy goodness and made fresh! The fries were delicious and they are very generous with the portion. I enjoyed chili cheese fries and my family had regular and commented on how good they were. This is a hole in the wall type joint so you may prefer to get your food to go. We dined in to really enjoy the freshness of the food. The cashier was friendly, quick and ruggedly handsome lol. **cash only**<//review>< rating>

Slower service than expected. Only 1 employee at the time. Took 1 order, cooked/prepared it, charged customer then took next order. Had to add money to parking meter when called to pick up my order, so had to wait for next customers' order to be done before receiving my order. No plans to return unless I know there will be more than 1 employee working. Glad I wasn't on a schedule (times lunch break).</review>

They lured me in with the beyond meat options and omg it is the best vegan burger I have had in the LA area. I put mostly all the fixins on it plus egg. Messy, unpretentious, and delicious the way a burger should be. I asked for no mustard or onion and they still put it on there, but boy am I glad they did! 😆💪🏿 But be careful if you have allergies or something like that.

Normally, I'm really pleased but this time I wasn't. My burger wasn't well done, which it usually is, fries were delicious though. Usually the guy who owns Ms. Ruby's is cooking, this time he wasn't; made a huge difference.< /Review>

I was not impressed with this establishment it looks like a unkempt fast food joint. It doesn't look like a bakery at all. I went there based on the reviews that were all lies. It's dirty and very unkempt where they cook the food looks horrible.< /text>

Best fresh beef burger special in the city, $4.99, but don't sleep on nothing everything is bomb! And be sure to get two pieces of cake if not you're going to have to come back.<//Review>

The customer service here is absolutely TERRIBLE!!! I only know of one other place that has horrible customer service like this. Sadly, this nasty behavior only comes from one employee. If anybody walks in an is greeted by an older Black man, I'd advise you all to walk out. Don't be mistaken, their red velvet cake is amazing! I went in one day to get my weekly fix and I noticed that the slices in the front looked much fresher than the ones in the back. When I asked for two specific slices in the front the man told me "I have to be able to reach them. If I can't, you can't have them". I was shocked! Then he started rambling about how he couldn't put pressure on the rack. So this lazy ass employee acted as if he couldn't slide the tray out a little bit to get the slices I wanted. When I annoying asked him what he was talking about, he started mumbling some things I could not make out. I just angrily walked out. Terrrrrriiibbbblllee!! I wish I could take back every dime I have spent here.</text>

First off I did read the coupon, evidently you aren't familiar with the wording yourself. Otherwise you would have known that no where does it say you cannot use the coupon for cake.

Last time I checked, cake was a food item. Please be aware of the restrictions if any on the coupon before you get on here and respond ignorantly.

Know what you are talking about and correct your spelling. Something is spelled S-O-M-E-T-H-I-N-G. Use that spell check before you get on here and look stupid. Since I'm up the street, I will walk up there and show you the coupon and you can show me where it says it cannot be used for a cake item.

Anyway, my review stands and again, I will not be buying anything from this business.</Review>

<review>I've had ok experiences and I've been disappointed here. What can you say. I chalk it up to Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder. I love my people but we are emotionally scarred.  If youre nice, they're nice. Don't expect 5 🌟 treatment. Food is darn good.< /review><name>N BILLINGSLEA</name>< Response>

For three years in a row they have messed up every picture order for fall and spring; either the pictures themselves (twice in one year they give me a photo with my daughters eyes closed first, and then on the retake she was mid-word when they told her to say something like unicorn; like you’re a photographer but somehow didn’t catch that in editing?) or the order is wrong/missing. This year they just completely didn’t give me my youngest daughters pictures even though they definitely took my money for them. It would be nice that at some point before my daughters finish school to get a picture order right, the first time. It gets old having to go back and forth with them twice a year, for fall and spring pictures. It’s not only the time I have to spend on it via phone, but in some cases it’s also scheduling *sometimes multiple* retakes. Going forward I wish schools would reconsider using this company. Or I just may have to skip having school pictures as a parent which is just sad. Hopefully I can get my pictures for my one daughter for this year, and then I won’t be giving them my business again.<//Text>

The photographer was super friendly and patient. He listened to what my son's vision was for his photos and made him feel like a model. He joked with us and made it a fun environment rather than just a boring school picture session. Thanks for making these memories for us.<//review>

<review>Where do I start. Bad quality prints where you can see horizontal lines from the cheap inkjet printer they use. My son's face is tilted up even though when taking the pictures he felt awkward and told the photographer he did not want to tilt his head upwards. His picture isn't even centered. When I framed it he is off center and can't see half of his shoulder. The other side where his shoulder is seen has backdrop showing. Good luck trying to get a hold of them too. It's amateur hour at this company. They're called studio 1? They can't even come up with a better name because they probably just change the number when getting so many complaints. Schools are cheaping out. I think all positive reviews are paid for. Even the posts with pics that ppl upload are terrible. Not focused and show a lot of background for no reason. Poor photographer and poor quality prints. I feel mislead and deceived. I want my money back!</review>< gmapID>

<Text>Friendly service, helpful and pictures are great quality. During senior pictures they are a little crazy because of the sheer volume and we haven't been pleased with the outcome enough to spend the $200 plus they charge for senior packages. But for all other portraits we have loved working with them.< /Text><time>1602095252097<//time><Name>H Freeman (soccermom)< /Name><rate>4</rate>< Gmap_id>

Especially in a time like this where unemployment rates are up in this pandemic, it should have been less costly. However if you are going to charge so much, then give a bit more prints and poses per package.<//Text>< pictures>

Ordered the USB drive with my daughters pictures on September 16th. I got a e-mail October 1st that they were on their way. It is now October 22nd and no delivery. Contacted them and they don't know what happened. "Out of courtesy to me, they would be willing to make another for me and give me option to pick it up. I asked, why was this option not given to us in the website?
Answer, we are doing it out of courtesy to you to ensure you receive it.
First of all, it is not my job to ensure I receive what I paid for including shipping.
I don't know who has possession of my daughter's pictures!!!! That's what has me very upset.</Review>

<review>Terrible company. For whatever reason my daughters school changed from Lifetouch to this company. The photographers do not know how to pose children. Always a basic hands to your side stance. Well this time they told my daughter to tilt her head down because her glasses created a glare. Seriously you’re a photography company who doesn’t know how to fix that?! Have her take her glasses off. Make shift her head to the left or right a bit. But no. Now we have some awkward looking photo because her head is tilted downward. You have to prepay for the photos so I’m stuck with these now. I’ll never purchase school pictures again as long as they’re coming from this company.</review>< Time>

I am sure whoever is on the PTO/PTA board gets kickbacks from them for signing with them.  Lifetouch is way better.  I emailed them about being unsatisfied with the quality of my pictures and no response.  It's been over 1 1/2 weeks.  I guess they do not care that they have bad reviews.  They should invest in better camera.< /Review><user_id>112276905670632148691<//user_id>< rating>

<review>Over priced for start and took them 5 weeks to get me my pictures with a simple necklace. Ordered December 20th and after multiple calls and follow ups they could not tell me where my package was. I had to make a trip to local post office to make sure they weren't holding it. As soon as i asked for a refund for my purchase of 100+$ they had it ready within a day January27th. Makes me wonder if they even shipped my pictures and dont care about customers orders.

One thing i will say was they weren't rude everytime i bugged them about my order. But definitely lack of communication within. Get it together!<//review>< Pics>

They charge a sitting fee for over priced senior portraits that most aren’t able to afford but if you want your child to be in the yearbook for there senior year you have to pay for it. It’s not like they weren’t on campus to take pictures for picture day they used for the rest of the yearbook they could have very well used those pictures..no they leave so many seniors pictures missing..disappointing!! way to go...great job! Your gonna wind up like lifetouch...Replaced.< /review>

<text>First I ordered picture for my son from his school. I ordered locket it looks very cheap. And I didn’t liked the picture as well. So I called the them and mailed the picture and necklace back. They said they’re going to send me back a check after few days. Week later I called them to say I haven’t received the check . They said they already mailed it and it will be delivered. Week later again I called they said they issued another check because I haven’t received the check. Another week I waited then called them again they said it should be delivered in a few days. Waited and called them again. They said sorry and they will send a check thru fedex today . Hopefully it’s true this time . In short they’re liar 🤥. Shouldn’t be trusted .< /text>< Name>

<rate>1<//rate><review>NOT PROFESSIONAL QUALITY IMAGES. BELOW AVERAGE, and cell phones yield far better images. It is all about whether the photographer understands their settings. I never thought I would say that Lifetouch takes wonderful school pictures, until my daughter's school switched to Studio 1 last year.  The images are consistently bad quality, not even remotely professional.  Last year, besides having an unpleasantly bright face from what appears to be on-camera flash, the camera lens' focus was on my daughter's shirt, so her eyes were a bit blurry.  We had her retake, and the retake was not great, but better than blurred eyes.  This year, the flash on her face was even brighter, and when retakes were done, her face was even more unusually and unpleasantly brighter than the last image (and her hair wasn't looked into by the photographer).  Any company offering professional photography services should know that a  simple inexpensive diffuser is needed to make the flash emit more natural and appealing results, instead of an unusually bright face.  Or a proper lighting set-up would do the job.  Studio 1 apparently is just a business that takes pictures, but is not knowledgeable of the fundamentals of photography and lighting.  Very disappointed.  I was looking forward to her school pictures, but it's such a waste of money that I would rather take my own pictures of her.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>I had to take my child in for her High School Senior Pictures. I've been to this location twice. The 1st time was to have the pictures taken. On this particular day, it was a mess back in the back where the pictures were being taken. Three wait time went way beyond what out should had & my daughter really didn't get a chance to do the whole photo session. There were only 2 photographers when we went in & a whole bunch of kids waiting to get their picture's taken. By the time it was my daughter's turn we had been passed the estimated time of wait they had given us & my daughter was ready to go! The 2nd time I went in to pick select my photos for purchase. I had arrived way beyond my appointment time & still wait ed for a long time before being taken to pick out the pictures I was going to pick & payoff our $440+ photo package. This is the company our children's school district hired to fulfill this task. I wish they'd offered options instead.< /review>< rating>

Update ::: Studio 1 made everything right :)

I did not receive what I ordered with my children's school picture package.
I was told I was going to receive 1 8x10 and 16 wallets of both my children, which is what I paid for.
When my children brought home their pictures all that was given to them was 16 wallets no 8 x 10.
I called their office and the lady stated that I did not order and 8 x 10 of just my child but an 8 x 10 of the class photo.
I stated to her so I paid all this $ for 16 wallets and a class photo . I told her next year I would just pass on picture orders and she stated to me they would still give each child an 8 x 10 class photo as a "gift" from studio 1.
I told her that doesn't make sense if all the children receive the class photo as a "gift" why did I have to pay for mine since apparently what she told me i paid for was an 8 x 10 and 16 wallets..
She said she would send both my kids 8 x 10 pictures to the school.
I will see if that happens. If it does I will update my review accordingly.</Text>

< Review>
This company were so lazy to fix my sons bowtie before taking the picture, mind you, my son wore a big red bowtie. Shame on them! Such an obvious mistake they failed to fix. Not professional. Never will I buy from them. Prices are definitely overpriced. If you can't take the stress and pace of taking pictures of students for school, then don't! This will only post if I click on atleast 1 star, but they don't deserve any at all!<//Review>

I call they say they never took his photo, and then call me back to let me know they found his photo now and will be sending it which I have not even recieved it's been 2 1/2 weeks now. worst experience. I hope bella vista elementary choose a different company because this this ridiculous.</review>

Receptionist is RUDE! Getting through to them is ridiculous. So I left messages never got a call back. When I finally got through to them they wanted to add an $8 fee since the time period had lapsed. I told receptionist I shouldn't have to pay that because they haven't returned my calls. She had the nerve to tell me "We always return the calls" Obviously not! They need a new receptionist with better customer service. If I could remember her name I would post it.< /text>

<review>(Changed my rating because I FINALLY got the picture on around 4/24/2019 but I wont order from them anymore. I dont want to go through the same BAD experience) original post>>BAD company..they shouldn't be giving service to schools. I have been waiting for my son's class picture since DECEMBER 2019 and been calling and calling to just get false info that they will send it to the teacher soon or to call in 2 weeks...keep calling and nothing..we are in APRIL 2019..still waiting after 2 messages I left in voice mail now hoping they call me back (DOUBT IT) I want my picture or money back and wish they get denied at schools.

<review>VERY LAZY looking work on helping a child polish up really quick and on the pictures, also. My kids attend San Jose Charter and I really wish the school would wisen up and find a studio that will actually take pride and practice what they preach in what they do. Don't bother wasting your time and money on this company.<//review>< user_id>

Our school uses this place for some reason instead of Life touch, I've never had good quality pictures from them. This year was the worst. She is red in the pictures, the editing was horrible.. One of her arms is significantly smaller than the other and the position they had her sitting was really awkward and made her collar bones stick out and look like she hadn't eaten in weeks, my child isn't even skinny!!. Perfect picture for a "feed the starving children" advertisement. When I called I got a rude receptionist, no apology for a wasted $50.< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Wow!! after reading the comments of the Studio 1 I will no longer pay for photos at my children's school . I pay every year for photos however this year was not up to my expectations my children my son was too dark and my daughter looked like she was completely caught off guard.. and her last name was spelled wrong I was going to call and complain however I see it will be waste of my time after reading these reviews . I just will save my money and take my business else where.

2 years in a row where my sons school pictures turned out horrible.  Again, they are blurry and his eyes are half shut.  Aweful.  I usually don’t write reviews but I’m so upset with the way these pictures turned out for the 2nd year in a row, I felt others should know.  There are so many other wonderful photographers for the same price.  Chaparral Elementary in Claremont, you can definitely find a better company especially for the price we pay!< /text>

Studio 1 has been my Go To Photographer for our past 3 Proms. The packet prices were affordable, the staff was polite, prompt and professional and Greg Kelm was amazing in turning around the pictures so that our students would have them in time before leaving for the summer. Thank You Studio 1 for always meeting and exceeding my expectations! :)< /text>

I received my one of my two sons' photo packages, had to call to ask for my other son's package.  The Receptionist took down his name and my home address and said the photos will be mailed and received by me within 5-7 business days.  I am giving them 3 stars because at least they say they are going to send me the photos.  I will wait and see how it goes.  To be honest, my other son's photos were a bit out of focus.  Not so sure I like the quality. Update: the company did a great job of replacing the missing photos, which sadly was not the company's fault, but the school's misplacement.  Now I have two sets.<//Review>

<review>Waited for my daughters school pictures for a few weeks. I finally get them there was somebody else's kid with my daughters name. I called studio 1 and they said they lost her images. I tried to schedule a shoot they said they are booked solid for a few weeks. She graduates on June 2nd and she will have no pics with  her diploma . These are once in a lifetime memories and they seem to be bothered I keep calling to resolve this .< /review>< Time>

First, they show up to my daughter's high school (Etiwanda), and don't give her a picture form to send home even though they took her picture. So we wait, and no pictures. So I call, and they claim the pictures have yet to be sent to the school. So I drive over to Rancho Cucamonga to their building. The first person says they can't do anything, and then the other person says they can because her picture was taken. I pay in person, get a receipt, and am told the pictures will arrive with all of the kids' pictures at her high school on September 20. No kids receive their pictures on September 20. So I call this morning to hear a recording for 5 minutes telling me I'm the first person in line, and after I finally get someone on the phone am told all of the kids got their pictures yesterday. They didn't. So she finally agrees to send "duplicates" asking if I have a receipt, which I kept. This time I request sending to my home, and after I ask her to recite the address, she gives me the wrong zip code. I ask for a tracking number, and she can't do that, unless I pay another $8? She tells me it will be another 7 to 10 days? To send it from Rancho Cucamonga to Fontana? She was rude also. This is the absolute worst photo place there is in the inland empire, and doesn't deserve to be in business. Inept, incompetent, rude. If my pictures do not arrive, I will have the charge reversed on my credit card, and go somewhere else for school pictures.< /text>

Horrible ! It has been almost 3 weeks and my pictures haven't arrived. Called and said they were backed up like if a customer cares about how they are not doing their job. Received no solution at all but to hope to get my pictures before this Saturday when I needed them for my daughters birthday party. My daughters school needs to change photo company. Hope they go back to Lifetouch< /review>

(Translated by Google) I do not like x that everything is very expensive only in the head of them can fit that charge $ 45 per photo and 5 × 7 I do not like nothing is too much that amount. Do not be fooled, we can take the picture in the graduation and reveal it in that size and they are the same as a barbarity for me it is not fair

(Original)
No me gusto x que  todo es muy caro  solo en la cabeza de ellos puede caber que cobran 45 dolares x cada foto  y de 5×7 no me gusto para nada es demaciado esa cantifad. No se dejen engañar  nosotros podemos tomar la foto en la graduacion y revelrla en ese tamaño y son iguales que barbaridad para mi no es justo< /text>

DDS Paul Vartabedian has done a beautiful job keeping my smile healthy. He recently replaced six veneers that were over twenty years old.  There was some decay under some of the old veneers and as soon as he replaced the first one (with the most decay), I felt so much better.  He is very knowledgeable and I believe he is the best dentist in California.  His staff is the is also great as they are also very knowledgeable and helpful.  They all work like a well orchestrated team.  Thank you all for taking care of me all these years<//Text>

<Review>I used to fear going to the dentist, now I look forward to it. Everybody working at Dr. Vartabedian’s office contributes towards making his practice a model for what dentistry should be. They go above and beyond to make patients feel comfortable, and they truly care for the patient’s health and well-being. I couldn’t be any happier.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The staff was very nice and accommodating. Dr.Vartabedian   made sure he explained everything during our first initial exam, made you feel very comfortable and that you knew what he was explaining. He wasn’t rushing to get to his next patient, he was focused on you.

I would highly recommend going to Dr. Vartabedian for his out standing knowledge of teeth, oral hygiene,  plus his welcoming staff

Thank you

<Review>Looking for a new dentist is hard especially when you’ve been going to the same one for several years! I have to say that I am so happy I found Dr. Vartabedian and his wonderful team!  He is  friendly and professional, took the time to go over my x-rays and answer any questions that I have. I recently needed a crown and he made the process comfortable and quick! His team is welcoming, kind and professional.  They made me feel comfortable and  at ease during the whole crown placement and initial exam! I am very happy that I no longer have to travel far for quality dental care!< /Review><Time>1591650757390< /Time>< user_id>

<Text>Hands down, the best dentist I have ever had. I'm usually anxious about going to have my teeth worked on, but Dr. Vartabedian makes every visit seem like a breeze. He is compassionate and gentle, always sensitive to the patient in the chair. The office staff is courteous and knowledgeable and have always treated me with respect. Love them!<//Text>< pictures>

Dr. Vartabedian and his staff are professional and warm. I have never had such a thorough initial consultation (I am a new patient). Dr. Vartabedian is a natural teacher so I understood what work needed to be done and why. From the moment I called to make an appointment through the payment & insurance questions, the staff were amazing. Highly recommended!</Text>

My first visit today to see the doctor.  He spent a good deal of time explaining the options I had and that helped me make my decision as to how to proceed.  The staff also spent a good deal of time with me before seeing the doctor and after scheduling the work to be done.  I was treated with respect and I'm looking forward to getting started on my new smile!<//Text>

Always a great dental experience. Best dental office in Lake County. A+++ Staff and hygienists. In my 50 years of going to the dentist, Dr. Vartabedian's knowledge of dentistry and oral health far surpasses any dentist I have ever been to. Wish I had come here sooner.< /Review>

< Review>
I made an appointment at this office, only to find that other patients  had the same appointment  time slot as mine. You sit and wait for  Dr. Vartabedian to come back in and work on you for a little bit, and then he disappears again. It took a minimum of 4 hours each time for the prepping and cementing of the crown.  Before  the crown was cemented in, I had Dr. V verify that the margins were good and had a smooth transition. He said that they were excellent. I get home and sure enough, the margins are over extended and I am tearing floss on them. I go back to Dr. V.  He states the crown has to be removed and redone. This causes undue stress on this tooth due to his  incompetence. He never apologized for his error.  I experienced a lack of caring and respect .  I have found a better dentist to replace this crown.< /Review>

<Text>I’ve been seeing Dr Vartabedian for several years, and he is the best in Lake County! I am fortunate to have found him, because another dentist had placed crowns with flattened surfaces, and Dr Vartabedian replaced them and restored my grinding surfaces. His undergraduate degree was Chemistry, so he understands my chemical sensitivities.</Text><resp>None</resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< Date>

Amazing!! This the best dentist's office I have been to in all the years I have been going to see a dentist.  Tabby, the hygienist is fun and thorough.  Dr. Vartabedian is compassionate and very knowledgeable.  Kristi who does the billing is fantastic.  Every single staff member in this office is also knowledgeable and are very skilled at their jobs.< /Review>

I needed Care Credit, they explained how it worked and how to get it. I paid my bill through the app and thought all was well. Called about my appointment, they said btw your insurance paid their portion your portion is. I said I paid that through care credit. Care credit hadn't let them know that. So the kind gentlemen called care credit on my behalf to get it straightened out. And he called me back to let me know I was good to go. I really appreciate all your kindness and help!<//Text>

Dr. Vartabedian feels to me to be a man of deep kindness, with superb grasp of all things dentistry, an awareness that his calm assists his patients in finding calmness and is a gentle leader with a vision of creating this unique atmosphere.

Everyone that i have had contact with at Dr. Vertabedians office has been courteous,  knowledgeable, and genuinely concerned for my oral health.  This is no suprise once you meet Dr Vartabedian. He is genuinely concerned about each patient's dental health, and he is hands down the most knowledgeable dentist I have ever been to visit. Not to mention just a nice guy. Lake county residents are lucky to have this caliber of dental professional available so close to home.< /text>

Went in to have a cerac crown done at this office. I was there from 10:00 to 4:30. Sat through two millings of this crown. Both attempts were short and had poor cosmetics. Bulky and unnatural looking. The dentist attempted to get me to accept this crown. I left without a crown and have decided that a lab technician is the only person who should be designing a crown. This is what they do. This dentist doesn't have the time or experience to deliver the proper results. Paul Vartabedian  does not seem to care about the quality of work he is turning out.< /Text>

When I arrived at the office, Paul came running out to my car and gave me 5 lbs of 20ty dollar bills.   Then Paul gave me and my wife all expense paid vacation to New Zealand.
All of the above is a total lie, but I can tell you Dr. Vartabedian and his staff Tristin are very professional and we are lucky to have them here in Lake County.

Thank you Dr. Mark</review>

<review>First time I went to the dentist without a parent or at a college health center. The staff was friendly and kind and Dr. Vertabedian shared all of his knowledge, took his time seeing me. I never felt like I was being pushed for him to stay on schedule.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Dr. Vartabedian and his staff..especially Tristin were expertly professional with my treatment today. I don’t know to many people who choose to spend their day at a dentist getting any procedure but today was awesome. I had a very difficult crown built and installed today while at my appointment. Dr. Vartabedian did an unbelievable job on calming me when it was time to numb and both he and Tristin made a fantastic team on getting the job done! Would highly recommend his office to anyone needing reconstructive procedures.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Why do I only get to give five stars?  I wanna post 6!  Moved here about a year ago and went searching online for a new dentist as needed to replace an implant.  Picked Doctor Vartabedian from the choices I found and couldn't be happier.

Before I get into the quality of the work (stellar) let me talk about "the rest of the stuff."  Staff: beyond professional, helpful and friendly.  Facilities:  state of the art. Information:  lots of it; in addition to whats going on in your mouth, they provide options, right down to specialist recommendations ("if you want the best implant surgeon go to Doctor Jay Uemura").

Now, quality of work: easily as good as you can find anywhere.  State of the art equipment and staff trained in its use.  I walked in to get two crowns and walked out a couple hours later with perfect, beautiful permanent crowns for less than I paid for my other crown some years ago that had a two week wait and needed adjustments. I'm usually pretty hard to numb up, but that wasn't an issue, nor did he need to numb the whole side of my face.

I picked Paul because he was a Prosthodontist, and was pleased to discover he does "regular" dentistry too. Oh, and this morning, he called to check on how my crowns were doing.<//Review>< pics>

I want nothing more than loathe my dentist. I mean, cmon, they stick metal things in your mouth. That alone deserves at least a modicum of animosity. Frankly, that simply isn’t possible with Dr Vartabedian and his staff. Hands down the finest dentist I have ever had. Knowledgeable and gentle, he does a great job of letting me know exactly what he is looking for and why. Let’s not forget the hygienists and office staf. All stars, one and all.< /Review>

I am overjoyed that I have found Dr. Paul Vartabedian whose education and experience places him far beyond what one thinks of when one thinks of a dentist.  Dr. Vartabedian works with matters of the teeth and mouth that are more comprehensive than normal dental health, working in the areas of prosthodontistry - the dental specialty concerned with the making of artificial replacements for missing parts of the mouth and jaw.
Dr. Vartabedian is warm, personable, and fully explains what is needed and what he'll be doing to adjust or correct your issue.  The staff is also excellent, making you feel like a family member as they busily establish the support needed.< /Text>

The most delicious burritos in East LA, the asada burrito plus an ice cold 7up is a must. If the lunch truck is operating I usually order there. Service is quick always make you feel at home, prices are reasonable for very robust burritos. I definitely miss them since moving out of the area, the skimpy and flavorless burritos out of state are no competition for this place. Lol, A++< /Text>

This place is really disappointing. First of all they put a price and after you order they say is not that price!!! That's not fare. Also, the personnel is not nice at all, they act like if you're asking for free...not good service and food...not flavor
I don't use to put bad comments but this is something really got me dissatisfied and dissapointed</review>

Food is very good, but be careful! The short chubby guy that works in the morning is a thief, he always charges you from $1 to $10 more depends on what you order. He never gives a receipt and if you ask for it you'll notice that you've been robbed.< /Text>

The cashier guy didn't give me my correct change. I had to ask for my receipt. The
Container with the chilli fries looked bad.
It looked like it was placed in the microwave.
I won't be back for sure.< /review>

<Review>I've been coming to this restaurant since it first started out as a taco truck called "A Que Taco" parked outside of the Safeway market on Indiana (Now El Superior). That was over 30 years ago. The green Chile roasted pork burrito is my absolute favorite dish.  It is quite delicious & huge!  You can split the burrito in half and eat it for dinner.  However,  if you don't want anything too heavy,  my other favorite is the chicken tostada!  It's also very flavorful and filling.  The chicken mole is also very delicious and so are the tacos of Carne asada. Basically every dish is fresh & made to order.  This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Boyle Heights!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Bad Customer Service at A Que Tacos Leonor!
We ordered and ate outside the food truck at A Que Tacos Leono’r on Feb 24th (Order #0122). After eating, we went inside the main restaurant of A Que Taco’s Leono’r to use the restroom. Once inside the restaurant, we found that both men and women’s restroom doors were locked. We asked the person at the cash register if we need a key to use the restrooms.  The person said whoever used the restroom must have left the keys inside. He also said no one else but the cleaning person has keys. We asked where the cleaning person was and was told they go in and out. Person suggested for us to go to Jack in the Box across the street. I got the feeling we were being denied the use of the restroom so I said we were clients and had not just walk in to use the restroom. The person asked if I had a receipt, which I showed. He then said he’d open the restroom for us. A few minutes later the person came over and proceeded to open the men’s restroom for me and said he could open the woman’s restroom using a switch behind the register. There was a sign on the wall stating that the restroom were for customers only. If would have nice not to have waited 10 minutes of our time holding our pee if we had just been asked if we were customers. I do believe it is illegal to withhold the use of a restroom for paying customers.

As far as the tacos,  we had carne asada, adobado and tripas. They were just fine and nothing special. We would have given a 3 starts just based on the taste of the food. But because of the bad experience, we give this place ZERO stars but it won't post unless you put a star i'm clicking it just to post.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have always tacos from the lunch truck and liked them. But today I decided to eat outside and frankly I am very disappointed. The Carne asada tasted like cow hide, onions and cilantro tasted like freezer burn and when I tried there chili seranos it tasted like dishwashing soap. I am having the bubble guts as we speak. :/ very disappointed.<//review>

They have several menu options that range from $5 - $10. It is always busy. They also have their taco truck out front for those who want to eat in their patio area.<//review>

Es rico y economico pero ya en dos ocaciones las salsas ya huelen mal y las chips ya olian a aceite rancio solo un poco mas de cuidado en eso< /review>

I would go as far as to say this is the best mexican bakery in Santa Cruz county. The conchas are fluffy and it pairs well with the sweet exterior. It is best to get them early in the morning when they are fresh out of the oven.</review>

<review>As soon as you walk in you are blown away by the delicious smell from all the baked goods. I tried this place once and haven't stopped going since. A huge selection of the best Mexican bread around town. I drive all the way from Santa Cruz just to get this delicious stuff! The people there are helpful and nice< /review>< pictures>

Got these pics of La Manzana Bakery from a different user on Yelp! since no one really posts pictures of their yummy bread. Friendly service. Line goes by fast and there’s always yummy, fresh bread !<//text>

Love La Manzana Bakery. The best French bakery in the city. I absolutely love everything they make (but could take or leave the morning bun). If there's a line, it goes faster than you'd think and it's worth the wait.<//text>

They are a non-profit organization that provides multiple services to the community with no fees. They give food away, help with utility bills, and more. The staff members are friendly and try to do as much as they can to help.

Cons:
Their address throws off most people when they are looking for this place. During the food give away, many have said that the volunteers cross the line with taking a large amount of the good supply.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Been going here for years and this is the worse experience I have had. My conchas were broken and other breads ripped in half. The conchas topping was very hard so all in all worse experience not going there ever again<//Review>

I also asked for air because my tire was almost to the floor they didn't even look at me anymore they just ignored me so I had to drive to the gas station on a flat tire to put some more air in my tire in order to get to another tire repair shop. I understand you were very busy but no matter how busy you are your customers are the ones that pay your bills you could have said the hose is there or you could have helped me get some air in my tire if there was half a star I would give you half a star<//review></record></dataset><record>

The worst place ever. DONT GO HERE! I hi asked them to rotate my tires, come to find out they stripped three of my struts and now I have to have them replaced before I can even get new tires on my vehicle. Pay the extra $10 for an oil change at Jiffy Lube.<//Text>

These guys left a flyer on my gate about being in my neighborhood on Monday, 11/2. I followed the instructions and left an old BBQ out front with the form filled out and a check for $20. Nobody showed up.<//Review>

It's always very clean, doesn't smell and not full of flies and bees as many other places are in Yuba City.
The guys are very helpful  and friendly and go above and beyond there job assisting you in anyway possible.
So the next time you have something to recycle, try here, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I've been a Google guide for over 8 yrs now and this is rated #1 in my guide.</text>< rate>

It was really easy to find and there were two families in front of me. They were taken care of asap! . I was a bit surprised how much I got for my plastic bottles and the person in charge was kind and courteous!. Gas Station and store was stocked @ fair prices and a (really clean) do it yourself Car Wash directly across the Street! ❣️... It was the best of all one could ask for and very easy to find, close to freeways and more...

<resp>None</resp><Review>A place of business has business hours to for a reason and as anyone would I expect them to be open during those business hours. However, I seems as if this place doesn't see a need to obied by those hours as I pulled up today 20 minutes before 5pm on a Wednesday to cash in my recyclables for gas money until payday. I pulled up stepped out of m vehicle and everything had already been closed up and the young kid who I believe is deaf says "we're closed" then closes the doors on the container. I see that as him being very rude and unprofessional. So from now on I will go out of my way to go to a different recycling place. Very disappointed and unsatisfied with this employee which now has made me disappointed with this business.</Review>< UserId.>

I wouldn't even give them 1 star! The guy must of thought I was stupid or something.  He tried to rip me off! Had almost 4 containers of plastic and 1 and a half cans and tried to give me 19 bucks! I was no like no way! He fiddled around and gave me another 12 bucks and even that I  don't think was right!  Do not take your recycling there,  there crooks!< /text>

Normally we have a great experience. Today we get the JB at 4:30 when the internet says they close at 5pm. Dude walks out to our car and says we're closed... we have to clean up. Maybe your business hours shouldn't say until 5pm!!!!<//text>

This guy ripped me off! I pre weight my load to know I'm not over the limit. He only paid me for 70 out of 95 pounds! I know there are variations in  scales but no way I could believe that  25 lbs dif. No way! And he kept tossing cans aside saying that they were unreadable. Now who is reading the cans? The drunk helping him idk? Then after I clean up he has his guys clean up all those cans(my cans) and guess were he puts them in his aluminum. But he cant pay me for them?<//Review>

<Text>They routinely close early, up to 45 minutes at times.
I noticed many discrepancies in total payouts....if you have a way to pre-weigh your recycling I recommend it.< /Text><Name>Melissa Jasso< /Name>< Gmap_id>

DO NOT USE THIS PLACE! We called, they said be here by 4:30, we showed up at 4:26 (having driven from Biggs Ca) and they refused us. Then sat back and gave us dirty looks and spoke in Spanish towards us as we were saying we were here before the time you told us! I will never use this place and recommend you don’t either.< /Review>

<review>With an intriguing name like Dickey’s for a Barbecue joint, I honestly didn’t know what to expect! I found later that it was a chain, but as I began to see more and more of this establishment popping up, I decided to give it a go!

Upon visiting, I happened to see a sign that was promoting a special for their 2 meat plates! It sounded like a lot of food, and because I had a massive appetite that day, I decided this was perfect!

When I received my plate, honestly I was a bit disappointed at the size of it. I thought I would be so hungry afterwards, that I have even began thinking about where I should eat next! Boy, was I wrong! I was stuffed half way through the meal!

The ribs were mediocre at best. Quite tough and not as tender as I’d have liked them to be. The brisket was good, but also dry. The chicken breast was actually done right. Not at all dry, and seasoned well! If anything, I think if you were to douse everything in barbecue sauce, it would have been delicious! My favorite sides of the night were the barbecue beans!

Great place to get barbecue at a bargain! Just remember that it is what it is!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3Y_rNmZz08Qcl3pxwDFwxRmEg8aLGv29sLWXQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2c5270741e057:0xa870e11392f89b38</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Food was pretty good and pretty decent price! It's pretty small on the inside probably like 80 people max. We ordered Family Pack (6 people serving) of Brisket and Ribs and when they brought the trays out we were surprised it looked pretty small but don't let that fool you. We all got full after digging in! The service was pretty quick we got served probably 5 minutes after we ordered. They have 3 options of BBQ (Original, sweet, spicy) that are self serve. Their beverage cups double as reuseable souvenir cups, super cute! They also have a complimentary icecream machine! You can get a free drink if you check in on Yelp.< /Text>< name>

Had to ask for options for family meals, still none offered.  Ordered by asking for two meats with sides, clerk said they did have that as an option.

<text>I ordered from here.   No napkins, straw and fork yes, but no napkins.  Tiniest BBQ sauce on the side I have ever seen for 3 meats.  Arrived freezing cold.  Caesar Salad had no dressing at all.  None.  How is that a Caesar Salad?  Worst order I have ever gotten from a restaurant ever.  Stay away.<//text>< pictures>

<user_name>L Reyes< /user_name><review>We ordered from here for the 1st time.  Dickeys used to be in Ventura county.  They left before I could try them.  Well I didn't miss much.  In Ventura County there is a BBQ place named Red's BBQ.  Dickey's can't match their flavor not price.  The Texas toast was great Red's doesn't sell them.  The Mac N Cheese was creamy.  Overall I don't think it's worth the price.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1602853063799, 'text': "Can you tell us more about your recent experience?

This was absolutely terrible. We ordered brisket and spare ribs. Both items were more fat than anything else. The ribs were so salty you can't taste anything elae. They need to taste their food before they serve it. We will NEVER eat there again.<//Text>

Honestly I had high expectations of this place the price is not bad at all for the portions.  ordered the 2 for $25 which is really good . Ordered both brisket and pulled pork but were very tough and not at all tender. This ruined my wife’s bbq experience although I thought it was okay at best</Review>

< review>
This place is absolutely the worst place in all of California! The service is abhorrent & every single employee is beyond incompetent! I’ve given this place multiple chances & each time they manage to mess up even worse than the previous time. I’m starting to wonder if the qualifications to work here are 1. Does not know how to read/no comprehension skills 2. Has a bad attitude 3. No customer service experience. If a customer comes back to say “I’m missing __” then logically you’d think the employee would apologize and make it right, not argue & make excuses. How can you actually mess up so bad that you “forget” to pack 8 sides. But don’t worry, you didn’t “forget” to up-charge me $5. I’m done with this place & so should everyone else! Can’t believe you let your employees look and act like this.</review>

<Text>I was initially excited for this place but it did bot deliver on my expectation and my experience will keep me from giving them another chance. The barbecue meats were all dry, they contained excessive seasoning, and the food was served cold. I would not serve this food to anyone and I would definitely not recommend this business.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2c5270741e057:0xa870e11392f89b38< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is horrible it was about 830pm and they pretty much told us that we couldn't sit down and eat our food and we had to take it to go. We didn't even get to see the menu. The attitude was horrible and it was just overall unpleasant.will never be going here again .< /review>

This is the best korean food in Los Angeleshands down. I had such a good time here that I am going to become a regular. I recommend this place to anyone looking for korean in the city. All the other restaurants are too expensive and not worth the price. But this place is different. Make sure to check it out, you won't be sorry!!<//text>

<text>The best place to eat BBQ at for a good price you dont need to break the bank with this place. The meat here is tender and cooked to perfection where it comes off the bone easily. The portions here are pretty big and the deals they have are a cant beat price anywhere else. I also like how there BBQ sauce here is self served so you cant put as much as you want which is more convient. Also the staff here cares alot about there customers here and it shows.<//text>< time>

There aren't a lot of American style BBQ places in Alhambra so this place hit the spot. Ordered the 2 item combo which included ribs and jalapeno sausage. Ribs were tender and sausage was flavorful. Spicy BBQ sauce on the side was good. Free soft serve at the end is always a plus! Free WiFi and free parking in the back.<//review>

Delicious! Smells yummy to your tummy right when you open the door.  Very clean; the best is getting dessert ( a swirl of ice cream on a cone) after your delightful dinner.<//Review>

honestly, no dickeys lemonade. No original dickeys sweet tea. Unacceptable!!! Also, staff was more worried about her cell phone than my order. Also, how about mentioning the specials for the day? Terrible, terrible customer service..not the standard dickeys experience I've come to expect. I'll drive the extra 5 miles to Pasadena next time.</Review>

Tucked away in the Santa Clara Caltrain station, this museum has some amazing artifacts from the last 100 years. Its all about trains: the equipment, the routes, the engines. Some great old photos and a replica waiting room. The real treasure in my opinion is the full room miniature city with model trains running throughout. Scenes are set up showing a lot of American history and how trains helped build this country. So fun seeing all this. They are only open 2 days a week, but i think its worth the trip.<//text>

<Date>1552172689518</Date><rate>5< /rate><review>A small but fun place for the whole family. We went around 12:30 on a rainy Saturday, and the Northern California Bluegrass Society was having a jam session (2nd Saturdays noon to 3pm), which made it all the more special! While the building wasn't crowded when we arrived, it felt pretty cozy and warm/stuffy by the time we left around 2pm. There isn't a lot of space to move around the model trains, so I wouldn't recommend it if you think the museum will be crowded and you're claustrophobic. Otherwise, I would recommend it to everyone.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKUYMe5kNGcMF4-EwNgq6fsbSMSmZ5vvKfToIq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQxjsJ4c-NRndQWjyyPCOWoNh5MEQBF9ryn5_W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaVNZ3GLRD7739GMvq1IkFVQzHwag5HhVXQw3B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE2RA-NTnMglck0Qo6Gdc0chvAqxS76riu2AgM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fcbaff30ed783:0xd52e246306ec9e08</Gmap_id></record>

This is a great experience for the entire family. An original Railroad Station on the Caltrain line. Inside you will find the greatest (and largest) model train layout I have ever seen! Lots of items on display, great volunteer staff who have great railroad stories and the history of the museum. This is a Must See! Check hours on their website and as far as I know-FREE (you can always put something in the donation jar).< /Review>

< review>
Cute hidden camouflaged train museum with lots of electric toy trains on what looks like hundreds of feet of train tracks going back and forth and through tunnels and by miniature towns of various periods representing the local regions and further away. Many old signages and sturdy lanterns, a grand sounding bell you can ring and lights to play with.  It's even possible to rent the facility to use with your own trains. Historic material available on trains, train conductors, train stations, uniforms, train companies,  and the various technologies used.
BE AWARE,  it's not obvious the museum is there,  even when you are standing a foot away from it's main entrance door or rear entrance door, which is a big brown sliding door that's normally closed and you'll need to open it yourself and close it after entering.   The building looks like it's  just an old unused building that's part of the Santa Clara train station.< /review>

My two year old always loves watching the model trains! The only difficult thing is trying to find parking--there are only about fifteen spots in front of the railroad society. Otherwise, you have to pay $5 at the Caltrain parking lot next door.<//Review>

Brisket here is really VERY good -I'll definitely be coming back again for more. Grilled cheese is really good too. Pulled pork & tri tip wasn't my favorite, but they weren't bad either -they  were just a little on the dryer & tougher side for my liking. The customer service here is really excellent -very friendly, helpful & patient. Had a few issues the first time here, but the staff went above & beyond to make things right -so it more than made up for everything.</Review>

<review>I had the market salad. $10. The ingredients were fresh. Mostly lettuce backed up by tomatoes. There  weren’t enough of the other ingredients to make what could have been a fabulous dinner salad. A sprinkle of feta that I couldn’t taste, so few sweet potatoes that when I got one it was a nice surprise. The quinoa was a generous potion positioned off  to the side. It came with a white roll,nothing special. I left wanting dinner.< /review></record>

< review>
I've been craving a Pulled Pork and Slaw Sandwich for awhile. I've tried other BBQ places in town and wasn't all too happy with the food. We just moved to this area of town and decided to give it a try, especially after reading the owners' bio/experience. I've ate at other restaurants that he was a Chef at and knew I couldn't go wrong.

When I walked into Big D's, I was hit with the typical smell of a BBQ joint located in the South. I ordered the Pork & Slaw Sandwich with a side of Potato Salad to go. Needless to say, I was brought back to my experience of my first Pulled Pork Sandwich in Memphis in the late 1970s. It was DELICIOUS and to die for! And, I love their Slaw. It's an oil/vinegar dressed slaw with tiny bits of green apple. That's very much a Southern thing! The Potato Salad was top notch also. It had bits of chopped black olives with a mayo/mustard dressing. Also DELICIOUS!

I would highly recommend Big D's for a BBQ Joint. It's clean, the staff was courteous and service was fast. I will be a regular there. Next time I have to try their Fried Okra.<//review>

Great local place! Family owned and operated. The food was great and the staff was amazing. We arrived pretty late as we didn't know what time they closed, we initially decided to go somewhere else as to not be a bother. As we were leaving, one of the staff came outside and invited us in and made us feel very welcomed. The experience was lovely and the food was amazing. Great little place.< /text>

<review>This was our 2nd visit to this eatery.  First visit was right after they opened and they were still working out the kinks.  But despite that, the food was great.  This time hubby ordered the 2 meat platter and I opted for the pulled pork sandwich special.  We both received generous portions and even took home leftovers.  The meat is so moist & tender, it just sort of melts in your mouth.  I also loved the coleslaw.  It is chopped, not shredded like most places.  I could have ate a bowl of it!  But what made this place special, is the owner (sorry, did not catch her name) came out and checked out each table, despite her working in the kitchen.  That's service.  Keep up the great work Big D's!  We will keep coming back.</review><Resp>None</Resp>< UserId.>

Do not go hear. This place is horrible. The ribs are nasty I can definitely make better ones myself. Went inn they didn't have several items available on the menu. Take a look at the pictures I posted. I can definitely suggest better places to go for BBQ!!!!</Text>

<text>We showed up at 8:15 just hoping they might still be open, they closed at 8pm....
But that didn't stop them from providing us an excellent meal and truly quality hospitality.
An employee ran out to offer to feed us before we could pull away stating, "you're welcome to come inside if it's just brisket we can do it a la cart 64l< /text><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

Had the pulled pork sandwich, the meat melts in your mouth.  Had it with a really nice side salad that had a varierty of different greens, tomatoes and cucumbers.  Then had their bread pudding omg.  Everything is made from scratch.  If you want good smoked meat and an awesome desert then you have found your gem. We will be returning.

This used to be a Dickey's BBQ place. The food was good. The service was slow. It was clean and the employees appeared to care about the place. I will probably go back at some point but the wow was missing.</text>

My husband and I were feeling in the mood for BBQ so we decided on going to Dickies. When we got there the name was different but decided to check it out. We got there at 7:45pm and they close at 8 (Sunday). We were about to leave because we know it sucks to be almost off and have people walk in but the girl in the front stopped us and said it was ok for us to order. She was super nice and we were going to order to go but she insisted they didn’t mind for us to eat there (you don’t find customer service like that anymore). She made us feel so welcomed. Since we were knew she suggested popular choices and we both ordered the brisket and cheese sandwich. It was AMAZING. The bread was toasted with a nice crunch, meat was tender and juicy and the melted cheese was perfect. We will definitely be back and bring friends and family next time. Thanks for the good food and good customer service!< /Text>

Took my grandson to Dicky's and found this place.  Figured we would givethem a try.  6:00 on Sat night...out of spare ribs...out of baby back ribs.  Out of 1/2 the combo menu.  Paid extra for 2 meat meal, brisket & pork.  Brisket was so dried out I mashed fork full in my fingers....no juice.  My fingers were literally dry.  The pork was so overcooked it was mush.  You could mash it like potatoes with plastic fork.  My BBQ beans with cheddar cheese on top?  Beans were still crunchy inside...They did let me exchange them for French fries.  Out of Mac & cheese & other sides.  Also announced out of beans after getting mine sent back.  The owner brought the fries to our table and I mentioned the issues including the dry brisket, she calmly said do you want gravy or sauce to put on it?  No concern for anything..just like oh well.
The cashier said "we've only been open for a month and were still trying to figure out the recipes.  It's hit & miss"  $35 later for 2 meals, the best thing was the bagged frozen French fries and powdered instant mashed potatoes & gravy.  We will definitely be making the trek to North Bakersfield to Dicky's when we go out for BBQ.  What a disappointment.</Review>

<review>Nice family owned bbq place, service was very friendly. The food was good a bit pricey but it sure stuffed me up. My wife had a tri tip salad and I got the smoke chicken diablo tacos with fries. I will come again to try some ribs. I am mostly all abt Saltys, but I am willing to give them a shot.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I rarely write reviews, but the food and friendliness of the staff is so exceptional it should not be missed. I have been a fan of some other BBQs in town ( won't mention names), but this one joins the list as one of my favorites.</Text>

<rate>2</rate><text>So normally I try a place twice before passing judgment but I might not try this place again. First the pro: the tri-tip was pretty tender and tasted ok (note the ok) so why won't I go back? Well, I wanted to simply try their brisket and tri-tip and ordered 1/2 pound each with no sides or anything else and got it to go. I just about fell over when I was told to pay $28!!! For one pound and nothing else? If it was the best in the world it would still be too much. Should have cancelled the order but decided to try it. Tri-tip was ok but brisket was .4 (out of .5) pounds of fat, virtually no edible meat. The person cutting and serving it should be ashamed. I got it to go and didn't have time to go back so unless they change their prices and meat cutting practices this will be a one and done place for me. Shame, I was hoping for good BBQ close to where I live.<//text>< pics>

I haven't been in a long time but there was (still is but not sure if it's the same place) a sushi place that had really good prices on all you can eat and had good food. I want to go back and see if it's still the same people and if they offer the same prices but stupid covid is stopping me. Once it's over or a vaccine is available I am going back to eat there. I think it's like Ashanti sushi or something close to that.</Text>< Pics>

Don't go there on weekends. Swap meet on Van Buren creates alot of traffic.  Parking is terrible as spaces are few for too many businesses. Traffic will get worst with apartments being constructed across from shopping center on Van Buren</review>

<Text>Went to the veterinary clinic. The location is easy to find, the place is clean and the staff were extremely friendly, especially Christie at the front. We went for vaccinations and the price really cannot be beat. Highly recommended.< /Text>< GmapID>

All places are clean, and pretty safe my only small complaint is the parking lot is almost too small now with the addition of Juice it Up and Wing Stop but if u drive around you should find a spot. The remodel if McDonald's drive thru has helped with the traffic congestion on that side of the plaza.  All in all, I recommend Lincoln Plaza for  a bit to eat or shopping at Albertsons.< /review>

The plaza is nice. We went to Albertsons to get some money out of our account. I purchased some see drinks too. Albertsons is nice, but a little pricey. I hate the California bag law. It is a socalist scam.</review>

There is a Vons with a BofA ATM. Restaurants of reliable franchises (Denny's,  Subway, McDonald's), and doughnuts, with a couple independent restaurants,  too (Mexican, Sushi, coffee house and I think Thai). Upcoming is a Mexican- flavors ice cream chain.  There is also a furniture store with friendly staff.< /text>
