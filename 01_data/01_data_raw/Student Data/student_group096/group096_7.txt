I have filed with Najai for the past 2 years and she is beyond outstanding! She is very professional and highly knowledgeable when it comes to tax laws and deductions! She also helped my mom and sister with their stimulus ! We will definitely be back next year! If your looking for a tax professional I would recommend Najai! 10/10 . Thanks again !!<//Review>

I been doing my taxes with them for the last 10 years. Excellent knowledge of tax services. Helped me with all the questions that I had. Got me the most back from the IRS. Customer Service with a  friendly smile every time I walked into that office. Filed my taxes at a great price. I’m happy I chose them to do my taxes with. I wish I could give them more stars but google won’t allow it 😃. So here ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Text>

< Review>
This is the second year I've filed with Liberty Tax and specifically Najai Robbins. I normally file with TurboTax because it is super straight forward and no hassle. Najai is amazing. She has completely changed my mind. Her turnaround time is second to none and she always follows up in a timely manner. She goes above and beyond every time and I have confidence that I am getting the most out of my return and that my return is accurate.< /Review>

<Review>our dog is a very shy little guy, so we were very concerned about taking him to a new groomer. I can unequivocally say that Pawsitively Groomed was so much better than I expected. He looked great, he was happy while he was there, and his bath and trim were exactly what we were hoping for.< /Review>< pictures>

My two dogs came home looking very spiffy and blow dried after their conjoined appointment (: Their nails were a bit out of control before going and came out beautifully shaped and trimmed!! I was very glad I could book for both of them at the same time.

I took my pup to Pawsitively Groomed for his first salon experience. The ladies were very helpful to this first time puppy mom, and had great suggestions on how to cut his hair. They let me know the approximate time he would be ready, and sent a text in that timeframe. My boy was comfortable in their care, and came out looking fresh and ready for summer.<//Review>

I was referred by my neighbor juvy who said Luana was AMAZING! I’m extremely picky as I have a shi-poo who has human hair and she has been butchered by many  to say the least!. Not everyone can groom however Luana pays close attention to detail, Is sweet to miss SNOOKIE and you should see her pony like  reaction when she knows she’s going for a visit to Pawsitively 🐶💕🥰 thanks for keeping her...not to smell like a cornchip and looking  like a STAR ⭐️ But strutting like a champion 💋❤️ Rhonda< /Review>

If you are looking for a groomer that will give your pet the love and care as you would, this is the place to take them. Carlos treats my dog like his own pet. He is gentle understanding of my dogs needs and always makes sure he is comfortable. He is truly the best at what he does and I'm so grateful that I found Him</Text>

The team at Pawsitively Groomed are all experienced, considerate and attentive to the needs of your pet. I have been using them for over three years and I have always had a very positive experience. I like the online booking tool as well. Our favorite groomer is Yulia but you can't go wrong with anyone on this team. Yulia alerted us to a tooth problem that we would never have recognized and helped us avoid an extraction.</text>

Thank you, Pawsitively Groomed ! They groomed my LHD yesterday and he looks wonderful and smells divine. They treated him with great care and I will never go to another groomer. He had very long, annoying hair to maintain and they simply did an incredible job, especially since he had never been professionally groomed before. Good work!!!</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>We have no doubt that owner, and certified dog groomer, Carlos Chaves is a competent groomer, however he has misrepresented his bio detailed on his website. He prominently states working at Russian Hill Dog Grooming for 2 years. We are the owners (of Russian Hill Dog Grooming,  highly acclaimed grooming shop(s) is San Francisco for 24 years. We should know. Carlos worked for us for a total of 24 hours at most ... 3 shifts. We have given him ample time to correct his mistake on his site, and after some time, he has not. Trust what you will. We don't.< /Text>< pics>

Our dog recently had a bad experience at a groomer who will remain un-named.  My wife and I met a lady on Burlingame Avenue recently and during the conversation of "dog care", recommended Pawsitively Groomed.

I was there today with my 16 month old pup and my only message to anyone looking for a groomer is, "this is the place to have your dog cared for",  the staff was absolutely amazing and were so sensitive  and gentle.

I can't say enough about Pawsitively Groomed other than my dog will never go anywhere else.</Text>

Best groomers in town. Would recommend for their customer service alone.

I work long hours and don't have much time during the day to schedule personal appointments, so when I got off work I called petco with plenty of time before closing to schedule a quick appointment for weeks away. After being told by a petco rep that someone was still in and could schedule an appointment for me i waited on hold for 30 mins. by the end of my 30 minute hold they closed shop and wouldn't schedule anything for me. that was the last time i went there.

After petco hung up on me, I called the dog spa and left a message. Less than 30 minutes later i get a text saying they can schedule my dog for an appointment the next day!!! They did that for me even after hours. From that point on I have been coming here. they do great haircuts and handle the animals really well.< /review>

<Text>I'm glad they use fresh lobster in their enchiladas, but I didn't want the shells in it too! Other food was o.k (Chile Verde very dry). but I will definitely try something different the next time! Very off putting. I will say that the Service was incredible and the drinks were amazing! The place is beautiful! I  was hoping that since this place is right down the street from me, it would be our go to. Unfortunately it didn't meet the mark this time.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5INPsWjd7n-JLbld18275MsQBc-xqRumGezQn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJhFrJmCq3c-HrCK-UYS1afqhCamcqVLBn0EbS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMztkzKKH3j0ZseP5X6NV0MLhO1wVXS5WnykXKA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPP66Ech_JT6XFEMUNgAa-nMKAtUvg0KxXZflD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo_46N0KL2M-yQas1G3rxR1Cd1AqakuPjMXltI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNI1-8abGdDmhxkf57VX2tUtjs8ccNrhx8OCV4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOm0PHJmBvUimCc5-P6-EzN83XHjDuKleqP7-W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpMyyK33WBZ-KgwbUnhwh6fRiQi4q9467rV6u5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQmVVrGwBlershzd818aq8wmQ3eOWi4oJR3uwB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-tokB_zYUhn8tVee4wGDFDSfJHVjxn5cCc9J1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgG8uzE6TY19xo7dqRLOZilfTctzlyZsn7EX_E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< rate>

<review>My sister reserved a table for like 10 or 12 people mom's 84th birthday. The people there were awesome the waitress was amazing especially for someone as young as she was or said she was not even 21 yet. The food was amazing and the birthday cakes cheesecakes I believe were awesome very tasty we all had a great time and even though my wife and I don't live in Temecula we would definitely go there again if we had a chance.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHkXh_vOcWuRAFfO0hitN7rrUeoaE8QtAtYAzA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxUccxr7HMMtmRsWEZiyRniul6O3V435Ewl1ys=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvvOhECY88eyR8CAJeApWD24JZCHnLc7DK0Gub=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjYUp5gJ37FgqBv2lXI3GqKPNTmXBuji3NWMbT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvnTkNL7GD1UfGtTD7xdn2IUwUO-ElcvSro_XX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><rating>5< /rating><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80db81f6edf1d645:0x3c2de3849764d581<//gmapID>< user>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My husband had the beef tamale plate and I had the chicken mole plate. They were delicious! I would come here again and tell friends and family.
The only thing I didn't like was the tortillas, they were not authentic but overall it was great food and atmosphere!</Review>< pics>

This is our new favorite Mexican restaurant in Temecula. Top 5 Carne Asada I have had with a little sweetness and smoky flavor. Everything from the chips to the kids meal was great. Huge space for large parties too. Definitely recommend</review>

<Review>Beautiful restaurant...they just don't make them like this anymore...I feel a sense of respect when I eat here. They treat the customer so well and offer such a engaging experience, the food is delicious. Service is quick and efficient, yet warm. The drinks are exciting and well thought out. The prices are very reasonable. Feeling blessed to have the Mexico Cafe in Temecula. Now...if we could just get them to offer a Sunday Brunch...please, please, please?<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Lived up to the hype. We have been watching this huge place being built since day one. We finally got over to check it out and it was very good. The atmosphere is good. We didn't have to wait long at all to be seated. They have multiple rooms that I'm sure could be used for private groups. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I had the chicken tamales and they were really good. Everyone else in our group also enjoyed the food. The prices were what's to be expected in a "fancy" Mexican food restaurant. All in all we had a great time and will be back for sure.< /Review><user_name>Doug Rosson< /user_name>< Pics>

<Text>The margarita flight was exceptional. Service was great Jaime, runner was great Riley, food was even delicious. Then we we ordered a large margarita of the most delicious part of the margarita the blue it wasn’t the same. We were told flights aren’t the same “batch”. While we waited to offer great  feed back to the Manager they never came. So here it is… If you offer a flight of your drinks make sure they taste the same. And remember the last experience your customers have is the only experience your customers remember so make sure it’s a good one. Visit all the tables especially when you’re new because those of us that WANT to support you are disappointed when you never show.< /Text>< name>

<Review>I kept in mind that they are brand new and still in the process of hiring staff and smoothing out the kinks. The wait is a typical popular restaurant wait time for dinner hours. The waiter we had, Pierce, was wonderful. He made excellent recommendations and was attentive, considering the number of tables he was waiting on. The food was delicious and the Mangonada (pictured) was amazing! The atmosphere inside the restaurant was akin to that of a resort, lots of seating and cavernous, which made it a little loud, but I didn't mind. I will try the outdoor seating next time. Oh, and as of now, there is no WiFi and the cell service is next to none. I'm assuming they will be putting in wifi at some point soon.</Review>< date>

The flavors are perfect. Cooked to perfection. I got the carne asada with two enchiladas, rice and beans. The have a lady making fresh flour tortillas. How is that not thee greatest thing.

This was our first time there and we were really excited to try it.  My husband doesn’t eat meat so they let him change steak n shrimp something or other  to chicken n shrimp, n I got my favorite ground beef enchiladas.  My husbands food was dry n tasteless n mine was so greasy I took a napkin n kept dabbing on the grease but it was just too greasy, you could see the grease n tasted horrible.  Sadly, we liked the people there, but this will be our second time there!!  Our 1st n our last!  We are gonna stick with Rodrigos’s which we have loved from the start.<//Review>

Drinks were GREAT. Service was GREAT! Unfortunately FOOD WAS NOT good. Mole did not taste good nor did my husband’s plate of food. We hope that it’s because everyone is new and maybe it will get better. Wish they offered comment cards to help with pointers. We are Mexican and did not like the flavors. We will only go back for drinks.</review>

First time walking in was a surprise.  It is pretty big and spacious inside.  The greeter was very friendly and courteous. Service was pretty fast.  Our server was Autumn.  She was very friendly and attentive.  Autumn came to check on us several times, but not excessively.

The salsa was very good.  You can tell a good Mexican restaurant by their salsa.

My daughter had the chile Verde.  It was good, but could have been a bit spicier.  Good nonetheless.  I had the chimichamga.  Very good also.

I am going back tonight with my wife.<//text>

< Review>
I really thought I'd like this new Mexican restaurant, but sadly I did not. We came during lunch hour (2pm).
The Margarita flight was the only thing my mom and I truly enjoyed.
I ordered a small Caesar Salad, one Fish Taco and one Chile Relleno and my mom ordered a 2 Combo Plate with a Carne Asada Taco and Shrimp Enchilada with a small bowl of Menudo.
The Caesar salad was delightful, the Chile Relleno was heavily battered and did not have much flavor. I ended up only eating the Chile. My mom said her shrimp enchilada was good but her taco wasn't anything special.
I never received my fish taco.
Our server was polite but seemed flustered, possibly due to understaffed FOH crew. Either way, when our food came out, they brought me the wrong dish entirely. Instead of a fish taco, they brought out a shrimp enchilada. Our server told us he would fix that. We both finished what they did bring out so I asked if he could just 86 the taco. He did and ended up gifting me a taco which was much appreciated. Unfortunately it was still not what I had originally asked for, but I couldn't be mad at a free taco.
In conclusion, I think I'll come back, but only for the margaritas and maybe a fish taco. I still want to try it.<//Review>

Excellent customer service, the atmosphere is nice, a little loud but it's very nice inside.
The servers are all friendly and professional.
The staff is very attentive in clearing off all items from tables and bringing chips and salsa to your table. Sangria was sampled and we bought 2 bottles. We will be back.< /Review>

Ummm so we have been here 3 times now and it has not changed what so ever. We have been to the San Bernardino one millions of times and that is a thousand times better. The Temecula one takes forever to get food and how are you suppose to make money when you can’t place a take out order over the phone and you are closed on Sundays. They need a new manager and they did change there manager to Ron for La Cocina down the road and he was great but they decided to go in another direction. It was only good 1 time and that is when Ron was there. They need a change NOW!!!!</Text>

So went to try out our New Mexican food restaurant in Temecula.  Margaritas were good.  Wait was over 1 hour to get a table inside, but were lucky enough to find a table outside the bar.  Had a good waiter, but he was obviously stretched covering several large tables.  My flour tortillas did not show up with my Chile Colorado , but eventually got them after my wife finished her dinner.

What really set me off though was as the sun had set, the heater that was located next to our table was pulled all the way to the other side of the patio, along with every other heater for one table.  Mean while my wife and I were sitting in the cold wind.  When I raised my concern with our waiter , the busboy tried to explain why they took our heater to the other side of the patio.  I was too cold to try to even understand the lame reason he was trying to justify why one table monopolized all 3 heaters they had on the patio.

Long and short of it, there is a better option for nice Mexican in Temecula.  Really too bad as I had really wanted this place to be a better experience...< /Text>

<text>Friendly staff. Pro-tip skip the crowd and sit in the bar area. You can enter from the outside gates. Open seating with table service. The Enmoladas are my new favorite dish paired with a Cucumber Margarita. We ride our bikes over from our house. So happy to have this new dining option in our neighborhood.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>107781669656058287042</user_id>< Gmap_id>

<review>Had lunch, was awewome. Great service. Opening kinks are to be expected. salsa was fresh and flavorful, cheese enchiladas had a fresh homemade sauce. Shredded beef tacos were lean, good cut of meat and flavorful.

Cadillac margarita = fantastic.

Will return visit.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80db81f6edf1d645:0x3c2de3849764d581<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Just visited this very beautiful new and clean restaurant. If your looking for “real” authentic Mexican food, this isn’t it!!!!  It’s not horrible but more Americanized then I’d prefer. It resembles Don Joses.
Chips n salsa were good though.< /text>< pictures>

The margaritas, chips and salsa are good. Unfortunately that's all I can say.
I ordered chicken taquitos- not only was the chicken dry but it was served with a slap of guacamole that wasn't to impressive. My fiance ordered the 4oz filet mignon and we were just surprised what 4oz looked like. We second guessed the weight of it and when brought up to the server she said "well I guess that's what it looks like after cooked. It shrinks.  After all it's only a 20.00 plate. But seriously it was the size of a tortilla chip. Lol.
The second server came up to us to pour
our water and we were laughing about the size of the steak. She said laughed and said  send it back. That's embarrassing. The beans tasted canned. I'm not of fan canned beans. . I hope they get there food part together because it has potential to be great.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Service was adequate. Food and drinks were good. It is a noisy atmosphere. We learned that it opened just two weeks ago. Hopefully they will make adjustments to reduce the excess noise because it made it hard for our group of 8 to chat over dinner. Margaritas were pricey.< /Text>< userid>

I wish they provided comment cards since they are currently doing a soft opening. I want to offer feedback solely in the hopes that they are able to use it to their benefit. Very polite staff, they are definitely learning on the job and it was fine. Like many reviews stated, the food itself needs improving. Our first batch of chips was definitely the bottom leftovers and had a burnt taste to them. However our second batch was fresh and delicious. Salsa is ok. Tasted like jarred salsa but still good. Our biggest complaint was everything we ordered was completely smothered with cheese. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love cheese, but it really was overkill. It was all you could taste because there was so much of it. Also, I got the chicken taco, and it was incredibly bland. Chicken had zero seasoning. It was also served on top of the beans so it was soggy and hard to eat. I will say, the beans are delicious. My daughter got the cheeseburger kids meal and funny enough we all sampled her burger and it ended up being the thing that tasted the best to us. I think this place has potential is they focus on improving the way food is prepared. They are close to my house so I am hopeful!< /Text>

Incredibly dissatisfied!

Service was a nightmare...

Your menu illustrates “Nothing Fancy & Delicious Food”...

You nailed the marketing and missed every note!

Each dish lacked every authentic Mexican flavor essentials... Seasoning! The saltiest food without any levels of flavor. The entire tables meal was poorly cooked to finish and missing all deliciousness that was guaranteed.

Sadly, a child could prepare a more flavorful / presentable dish from an EzBaked oven.

Hope that this was simply a poor experience and not your daily operation!</Review>

Drove from Menifee to try this place.  Had high hopes but was a wasted drive.  Restaurant was very nice.  Service was good.  Food was below average.   Beans tasted straight from the can.  Salsa tasted like jarred from the store. Meals include tortillas on request.  Tortillas are made fresh which was a plus.  We asked for butter and were told they don't have butter.  No reason to return here.<//text>

I give a 4 because it just opened and a lot of new staff trying to mesh together.  The food for the most part was good.  The little burrito that comes with the combo platter just had chicken only and nothing else, strange.  Also I ordered beef and got chicken, oops.  My nephew gave a 2 as he was not impressed.  The busboy spilled water at the table and some got on my son, he was grumpy after that.  The margaritas were tasty but a bit $$$.  Anyway it was a nice place and we will go again after they have had time to settle in.  😃< /Review>

Came here during the Grand Opening and this place was packed.

They have a lot of parking, but on a busy day you might have to park across the street.

As for the restaurant I would have to say it's the nicest and largest Mexican place in Temecula or Murrieta.  Has different wings with one a bar, outside eating, dining. Kitchen, and I believe more of a private room. Also when you walk in the place is beautiful with a gran entrance with high ceilings and nice decor.

Service was a lil slow but hey what place is perfect on grand opening day with new staff and all, overall they did well and got order right.

Prices are beyond fair on meals and they have perfect portions.

Location is prime as its not far from the freeway exit and on the way to Pechanga.

Staff is great very nice, happy and all for helping out also.

Overall great place and will be back for sure.< /Review>

Impressive ambiance and beautiful restaurant,  not your typical taco restaurant.
Staff, very attentive and backing each other up as it is now still on their soft opening.
Food: long wait, though it was not busy for lunch, wife ordered fish burrito; she said it was good.  I ordered the steak fajitas which was a gargounteous amount of oily and salty green peppers, onions and tomatoes slices with minuscule slices of steak; which you needed to explore for, the rice was good, but the refried beans tasted like they were just out of a can. Overall, having a great place with great staff with great service but if also a main ingredient is to to have good/delicious is not there or is not consistent, customers may not come back.  Definitely not Lalo's Restaurant  like in the Chicago area.<//Review>

We had a birthday dinner for 13 people this evening.   They don't take reservations, but the wait was minimal being a weekday.   The server was excellent.  Food was pretty good.  I had a shrimp enchilada and chile relleno combo.  The enchilada was excellent!  Chile relleno was fresh and good, but not great.  Beans were good, smothered in sauce and cheese, rice was rice.  The others said their food was good, but nobody raved about it.  A man, possibly  one of the owners came across high-strung.< /Review>

Major let down. I was looking forward for the place to open only to be let down by unauthentic taste of Mexican cuisine. Not only did the food lack in flavor but the service was terrible as the kitchen manager rudely told us not to order something off the menu (why was it on the menu to begin with?)< /text>

<Text>For a new Restaurant: Gewww!

Service: 1*
Food: 1*
Drinks: 1*

Service: Incredibly under par. The time it took to be spoken to once seated was astronomical. The time it took to take an order was ridiculous. The time it took to receive our food was... Unreal! 45 minutes to receive our drinks and nearly 2hrs to receive our food. Unfortunately, we had to chase down our waitress for our check so that we could politely pay and finally leave!

Food: Without a doubt whomever is cooking is doing so without love and tastebuds. The least flavorful, poorly served Mexican food at top dollar served in Temecula. A sad disappointment for such a beautiful restaurant!

Drinks: The beer on tap is served wonderfully cold, however the margaritas are unfortunately distasteful! Our table tasted margaritas stretching from standard, Cadillac, strawberry and mango. The consensus was that the drinks did not taste of a fresh mixture and were served sweeter beyond measure.

Overall, our table of 5 spent over 3hrs start to finish to complete our journey at this new restaurant in Temecula. We were amazed by the ambiance, culture and environment. We were greatly discouraged by the service, food and drinks.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80db81f6edf1d645:0x3c2de3849764d581<//Gmap_id>< Time>

First... the service was great! The girl who waited our table along with the guys helping bringing out the food were awesome. The food though was just ok. It's kind of bland and not very authentic. It didn't taste like it's made from scratch.  I know it's new but I'm thinking it's not the cooks it's the recipes (or doctored up pre-made food). It's pricey for the food we got.< /text>

In such anticipation to finally eat here.. drinks were great, service was good and staff is very friendly.
The food- was a big disappointment.  I am Mexican, so if you are looking for "authentic" or even good Cali- mex food, this is not the place. Food in general seems very "americanized". Not fresh. The beans and rice dont have flavor and very dry. The chili Colorado tastes like chili beans from a can. Its Saturday and the lady who is staffed to make homemade tortillas was not present until dinner time???
I hope that this feedback will be useful to the kitchen in Hope's that the food improves. I wish them luck.< /Review>

There was much hype surrounding the opening of this new Mexican restaurant so I decide to give it a shot.

At first look, the restaurant is beautifully built and the decor is very appealing.

We ordered a sangria sampler, the ceviche and an ice tea to start. The sangria sampler was watered down and about 80% ice. The tea tasted odd. Not sure if it is from a machine but it had an unappealing flavor. The ceviche was disappointing. The juice was red, but did not really taste like anything.

For our meal, we ordered enchiladas langosta and the fajitas (steak, chicken, and shrimp). The portions were generous. The enchiladas tasted good. Very flavorful. The beans and rice that accompanied it were acceptable.

The fajitas were a massive disappointment. The sizzling plate comes out and an entire restaurant watches as it is placed on a table. That was the most exciting part of this dish. It lacked flavor and was very bland. The veggies, the meats, the tortillas, the guacamole….all could have benefitted by some simple seasonings. Specifically seasonings linked to Mexican dishes.

I wanted to love this place. It is a gorgeous setting, but the only thing authentically Mexican in this establishment are the paintings and names on the menu.</Text>

I will  not eat here again. My appetizer came out with my entree. The Flautas were bland and too large to be called flautas. The Chili Relleno's batter was very thick and lacked flavor. For the poor quality  of the food it was over priced.</text>

First time here at the legendary The Mexico Cafe's new location in Temecula Ca. They have a very roomy and bright Restaurant here. I believe they have fair prices good  portions and very flavorful food. The only knock I have which is kinda of big is only three styles of salsa one hot and the house salsa that comes with the chips and and another one thats supposed to be hotter than the house salsa, but i could tell the difference only that one was a little sweeter than the other. This is big considering most people who love mexican food can literally put salsa on every bite of their meal. I will definitely be back, one of the reasons is they have probably the best fajitas I have tried in the Diamond of Riverside County (Temecula, Murrieta &Menifee). So give them a try .<//review>

Family, friends and I have waited over 2 years for the Mexico Cafe to be built and ready for business. Was is worth the wait? You betcha!!! We went several times prior to the official grand opening on June 15th and were treated to a stunning atmosphere, awesome Maragaitas, great food, and of course the most important element, the people and the service they provide. I like the fact they are family owned, and their commitment to excellece, as shown by the staff they are hiring. Congratulations Manny and family, with special shout outs to Pierce and Kaitlyn, and of course Ron who just joined the as general manager. No, I am not a family member, nor did I receive compensation for my review. Mexico Cafe simply rocks!!!<//Text>

Soft Opening Review

First: The chips are beyond salty, I asked for new ones and she brought me a new bowl with warm but tiny end of the bag chips.

Second: If you plan to get ceviche go somewhere else, they call it ceviche but it is shrimp cocktail. It was pretty good but not what we wanted...since we thought we were getting ceviche.

Third: For fellow military families please be aware that their discount is only for the service member's plate. They told us it does not count towards the appetizer since he shared with the table. Therefore families with deployed service members (aka spouses) there is no discount for you or your children, they are only doing it as a courtesy for a service member that is present and on food he does not share even if he is the one paying the check. I have never known a restaurant to do it this way but just be informed on their policy.

Lastly, the young girl being trained was great! She was trying her best and had a positive attitude, the older lady training her seemed a little frustrated with the young girls mistakes which is unfortunate as the young girl was really trying! We liked her.

We won't be back. The food was okay but overpriced for the portions, most of it was really salty and lacked the authentic Mexican flavor. Also, the Dr. Pepper was flat so get water or try something other than soda.

Beautiful building with limited parking.< /review>

First of all, it's new so it's very clean and has lots of tables, booth's and outdoor seating. The servers were very polite and attentive, the prices are very competitive. I had the Chile Relleno w/rice and beans (de la olla). Rellenos were good, beans tasty, rice a little dry. Albondiga soup was very good. You only get a fork so you have to ask for knives and spoons!</review>

First time visit & early dinner on 6/10/21. Service was good. However the food was average. I ordered a carnitas enchilada and got a cheese enchilada. The chile relleno was dry. The shredded beef taco was average. Overall I was disappointed, I was hoping for a great new Mexican restaurant. Temecula needs a great full service Mexican restaurant!< /review>

We were told 45 min wait but waited ~80 mins. I'll attribute the wait to the crowd and typical new restaurant growing pains, it happens. That's fine. For me it was the long wait for our food once we were already seated and I really just didn't love the food. I had ceviche and tamales. I've had ceviche that was leaps and bounds better from grocery stores. The tamale filling was equivalent to frozen taquito filling and the sauce they served with it was a loose version of freezer bean and cheese burrito filling. I may have just ordered the two worst things on the menu because the rest of my family mostly liked everything. I will say that I LOVED the chips and salsa though. I dont think I would go back myself, only if someone invited me out and wanted to go there. I do think that the (mostly teenage) staff was doing their best and trying very hard. I liked every employee we came in contact with.<//Text>

<review>Everything was terribly subpar, especially for $16 a plate. Even forgetting about when the server literally spilled the water all over my cousin sitting right besides me, the food was a crude, bland and failed attempt at anything remotely called authentic Mexican cuisine. I ordered the Burrito de Camaron and while the shrimp wasn’t bad, the burrito was overridden by the supremely dry rice and a lack of any salsa, even after I asked for the creamy ranch sauce. The waiters were all terribly inexperienced. The one redeeming quality was the atmosphere, but even that had something missing. Opened up before hiring a cook chef or good staff.</review>< Pics>

For the first time going to Mexico Cafe it was amazing the front desk girls were phenomenal we were greeted by Chloe our waitress. She made sure that we had everything, she was very attentive, we ordered the albondigas the carne asada fries the fajita shrimp quesadilla the carne asada burrito the kids cheese quesadilla and last but not least tacos de Pascal. We can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu and for sure we'll ask to be sat and Chloe section.<//text>

Unsure about other reviews here.  There have only been soft openings to date.  People leaving low reviews may be competitors if they are not understanding of expected pre-opening difficulties....give them a chance to get the kinks out.  IMHO their pre-opening was a HUGE success...especially compared to Los Panchos first couple weeks, who ran out of chips and had much worse service, during opening weeks.

Regarding food, imho, they had some of the best food i have had in all of Temecula and most in San Diego as well.  The Margaritas and Chile Rellenos in particular were exceptional.

Expect a full review soon....so far, it is already the BEST mexican restaurant in Temecula...and it will get better with time....Their location, views, and ambiance were also exceptional.  It is my NEW "GO-TO" for when in the mood for Mexican dining!  Congrats on a job well done, and I personally happily welcome you to Temecula.<//text>

I understand it was a soft opening. What I think they need to work on:

Food was clearly not authentic, cooked from scratch. It was bland and seems to be SYSCO type pre-prepped e.g., rice was bordering on boxed  style. Beans were like re-heated canned Sun Vista. Chile relleno was like COSTCO frozen. The margaritas were basically Cuervo mix and weak to boot ($45 Bills for the BIG one, "CMON MAN"). in comparison to their competition up the street Guadalajara's. Customer service on the other hand was top notch, these people were giving 110%. I plan on giving them another shot, but I sure hope they get a chef who cooks from scratch and seasons the food.</review>

Let’s start with the experience...

Not good at all!

Service: discombobulated to the max. Please serve your tables in a reasonable time. After being sat: 22 minutes before being seen. Order taken: 45 minutes after being seen. Food served: 95 minutes after being sat. The table next to us, who order 15 minutes before use received their order as we were checking out. Each table was a set of 4 customers.

Note: dishes were either undercooked, cold or completely wrong!

Nachos: sadly prepared without attention to detail. It is as if the chef grabbed handfuls of ingredients, tossed them in the air and hoped that they landed accordingly on the dish. He then tossed it into the oven to crisp the chips and melt cheese with hopes that it would be appealing and taste delicious, it did not!  It was served as a complete waste of ingredients with flavorless shredded chicken that I would serve to my dog when he is sick!

Tacos: OMG! Not in the “oh my god I can’t stop eating these delicious tacos!” More like, who would ever charge a penny for these tasteless tacos? What a mess! Taco shells were under cooked, the meat was undesirable that a fast food restaurant wouldn’t serve this standard.

Kids dishes: Wow oh Wow! I know that y’all messed up an appetizer and a taco dish but how could you ruin a simple quesadilla? A quesadilla has never appeared or tasted so terribly unpleasant. Obviously the head chef of The Mexico Cafe Temecula! If you can’t teach your cooks how to prepare a quesadilla y’all are in for some big trouble. It’s not that hard... Tortilla, cheese and crisp the tortilla with a melted core! You can’t put a tortilla in a serving dish, add cheese, fold it in half and bake in a hot oven to serve! It looks terrible, the taste is unsatisfactory and definitely off if there is raw lettuce or chili’s accidental in the mix. It didn’t happen just once, on two occasions our kids quesadilla came out with other ingredients than cheese and poorly cooked.

Let’s talk about the plating... It’s as if you were in basic training and your fellow soldiers were exhausted with no brains in hand and slapped your food onto a plate for dog chow!  Not acceptable...

Drinks: The margaritas were as if I was sucking on a iced popsicle of processed garbage made for adults. It was a sad disappointment of execution.

Wish y’all great success! However, please fix your overall service, cooking, plating and timing🙏🏼</review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Delivered a load here this morning. Appointment was at 4 am. Checked in at 3 am. The security guard was very friendly & helpful. Gave me a map of the facility & told me exactly where to go. Once I arrived at the docking area, the guy was waiting for me there & told me to put it on a dock & unloaded my trailer in 20 mins. Nice clean facility with friendly staff.< /Review><date>1598637379166< /date><userid>115099807417979901706</userid>< Gmap_id>

Came in expecting  a big headache and possibly having to go through a lot of time and money. Left after a very pleasant hour with new plates for a truck I’ve searched for, for over 10 years. Cant say how happy I am with their service and level of professionalism. Would recommend to anyone!<//Review>

If you are looking for friendly service and a knowledgeable staff please check out Legacy Auto Registration in Orange. No matter how hard of an issue you have they will figure it out for you. They have registered golf cart, boats and vehicles for me without any issue. It's nice not to have to deal with DMV. There's never a wait and 99% of the stuff is done immediately. If you need a vin verification or even a reconstructed title they are you one stop shop. So nice to be able to support a local business and skip the lines.< /Review>

DMV ALTERNATIVE

The staff is super friendly, the process is quick and efficient, and it beats the DMV on every level! They are open during this pandemic BUT are taking safety measures.

Skip the trip to the DMV<//Review>

After working with Legacy Auto Registration twice in the last month, I’m sold. I do not plan on setting foot in the DMV, again, unless it’s something I can’t get done here.

From the convenience of not having to stand in long lines at the DMV, to the professional and exceptional service, I highly recommend Legacy Auto Registration for your DMV needs.<//Text>

I found about this business middle of last year. I have been here three times since and every time they get better and better. The service is excellent. Very friendly and very informative. Any questions I have, they have the answer to. I recommend this to anyone and everyone needs dmv services. Usually I wait over a month for my title to come from the dmv. Legacy auto registration gets me my title in two weeks or less every time! Excellent<//Text>

Sandra took care of my registration on a 1962 impala and if you know it is a very difficult process when it comes to classic cars, she was able to get everything done in record time, also very dependable. Legacy auto registration will now be my primary choice for all of my registration needs, Thank you again for the wonderful transaction.< /text>

Legacy Auto Registration is the place to go if you need a renewal quickly. They are fast, efficient and the most friendly people around. Why wait in line at the DMV when you can come here.

I went in today to get my out of state registration taken care of. WOW! This place was great! No wait and I was in and out quickly. They were very proficient and knowledgeable with getting all the paperwork done. Such a breeze and so pleasant to work with. I drove away with registration, stickers, and plates in 15 minutes. I'll be sending everyone I know their way!< /Text>

<Text>I’m not one to normally write reviews, however when you come across a business that above the rest you just want to share your experience.
Jessica and Sandra takes care of all my DMV needs for my Dealership. There knowledge all aspects of DMV is so helpful, especially when I might have a deal that is a bit complicated they have a way of simplifying and getting the job done!
I also will call on them to ask question they are always available and ready to help.
I’ve been in the car business for over 30 years and have worked with numerous agency’s
Legacy Auto Registration is by far the best !!!<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This is a convenient store-gas station and at peak times gets very busy.  Their gasoline prices are normally the cheapest you will find anywhere nearby.  If you use a debit card they charge .35 cents, if you fill up still cheaper here. The owners are usually present and are nice once you get to know them.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwsYgWVmaSJiEGprZcXEm-iFuaBbosmHcR86xC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSTGzkVU6t5ecYLCy1wIVQO6qjfjXMK6BcDp8d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgI7BbOitzOJ84CVKWSamCAFDevnRZ5D6jf_Hw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Yes, great gas prices but at what cost? 2018 we were double billed (debit card) for a purchase on the same day, same time, same amount.  Confronted him and 4 days later we were credited for the double bill.  3 days ago, Feb 2020, it happened again! Owner said give him our number and he would call by noon the next day (showed him our banking print-out)
No call received.  Went down there and confronted him again, he 'forgot'. This is the 4th day and still no word. How many other people does this place do this to? I think the government should investigate the owners. I think I am calling an attorney to investigate them!<//Text>

<Review>The price of their gas is at a very fair price.  The service is good and they are friendly.  The coffee bar needed some TLC, the coffee did not taste freshly brewed.  Lottery tickets are sold and shelves are stocked.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80ea425ed40de415:0x7247f1420706b3b9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Scheduled Safelite and told me to be home from 8:00 am - 12:00 noon. Waited until 12:30 pm.  Called safelite and all they could tell me was that the tech wasn't answering his phone and they don't know what's going on. Management says they will call me back after their lunch at 1:30 pm. Typical for Stockton Lodi! Any service provider could run a successful business here just by following through on what they say they are going to do.<//review>

10 day wait, nothing, Complete incompetence, uncaring of my situation and very defensive when I asked why they were treating me this way with no answer, "We don't know where your Windshield is, we don't know when will come in, could be months, and no we did not order it, check back later." I don't understand how they make money!!<//Review>

This was the best experience I have had with a company in such a long time. Safelite on Wilson is top notch and they deserved to be recognized. I showed up for my 1PM appointment to get my Honda Civics windshield replaced. I was greeted by the person at the front desk whom went to get my technician Jordan. Jordan made a great first impression. He explained it would be around 2.5 hours due to my car having the ADAS camera and it having to be recalibrated after the windshield replacement. I waited in the shop (I had no ride 😞) while my car was being worked on. I felt very safe in the waiting area due to masks being mandatory and the chairs and such were 6 feet from each other. I worked on some homework and before I knew it Jordan came to grab me and said it was finished. I kid you not, it had only been just over an hour since he started on it. He explained the details such as what and what not to do in the next couple days to make sure the windshield sticks. He even stuck my parking permit sticker back on the new windshield. I am very pleased of the job that Jordan did. Jordan made the whole experience a breeze and I appreciate him very much. To everyone at safelite on Wilson I appreciate you and thank you for getting me in and out with such quality of work. Any management that reads this please tell Jordan he did an amazing job and I think he deserves a generous raise (or at least a bonus 😎)

<Text>Called this place and was directed to the Safelite call service. Rep scheduled my appointment for 11:30am so I arrived at 11am. The front desk employee looks for my appointment and tells me that I was scheduled for 1:30pm. I told her that there was no way I would have scheduled an appointment at 1:30, since I needed to pick up my wife and daughter at that time. I immediately thought the worst and figured my 45 minute commute was a waste. Marissa, the front desk employee, tells me that it’ll be ok. She goes to the garage area and speaks to Jordan, whom I expect is the manager at the time. She comes back and tells me he’ll take care of it for me. At the time, Jordan T. Comes in and tells me that he would be more than happy to work a little harder to make sure i was taken care of. I pulled my truck around and was on my way home, in what seemed to be less than 30 minutes. I can not think of the last time I’d experienced such awesome customer service!!! Marissa and Jordan went over and beyond to take care of a customer!! It was quite the experience for me! They have made a customer for life!! Thanks to both of you! Much appreciated< /Text><username>Tony Ybarra< /username>< Pics>

<Review>They replaced the smashed window well, but they didn't explain why they didn't tint it as they were directed and the window was not rolling up properly. I had to call them to set another repair time and drive to their location so they could do a simple trick to fix the issue.< /Review><Name>Simon Alemu< /Name><gmapID>0x80900cc78d2b1aa7:0xb00673a8fefffe3b</gmapID><date>1575304958591<//date>< pictures>

Best glass repair shop I’ve ever been to! They were super friendly and fast! I’ve never received better service anywhere..will definitely recommend to anyone I know. I was in a hurry and having a bad day when I walked in, the man who worked on my car noticed and went above and beyond. He not only fixed my windshield in record time, he vacuumed my car! Thank you again! You guys are the best!!<//Text>

If you have 3 or more chips they won't do a repair, only replace. Very very pushy trying to do a mobile unit instead of going to the shop. I canceled and will go some where else.<//Review>< resp>

<Text>I replaced my cracked windshield today. They replaced the windshield very quick. When I was driving back home I was very unlucky to get my new windshield chipped but a rock. I went back to Jordan on the same day and they repaired the windshield free of charge. Jordan is a very knowledgeable guy and his customer service is over 5 stars. Thanks again Jordan!</Text><GmapID>0x80900cc78d2b1aa7:0xb00673a8fefffe3b< /GmapID>< Time>

I had a rather noticeable chip on my front windshield and went to Safelite to get it filled. Jordan was the tech who helped me and was very friendly. He greeted me right away, introduced himself, let me know what the process of filling the chip was going to look like, and showed me right to the waiting room. Here, I grabbed a quick cup of coffee and waited for no more than 20-25 minutes. Jordan came back with my car and showed me the filled in chip, which is no longer noticeable at all! Great experience, great service! 10/10 will go again when I get another chip because chips are inevitable.<//Text>

<text>I was very pleased with the work done by your company. The person that was sent out was very dedicated, professional and polite. It's hard to find people in today's world that care so much about the quality of the work that they do, but you have a fantastic employee that is a true professional. I would not hesitate to recommend Safelite to others! The job was done to perfection and I was pleased with the outcome.

Best customer service I have experienced! Wonderful staff! Jordan was very knowledgable, very transparent about worst case scenarios, and quickly fixed the gouge in my windshield. On top of that, he went the extra mile to wash the exterior of all my windows and vacuumed the floor boards. If the universe decides again to throw a rock at my window or an angry ogre smashes it, I will be bringing it back to this establishment for repair.< /text>

The service tech was on time, efficient, friendly, and professional. The new windshield looked great and the tech even cleaned all of the other windows when he was finished. Quality glass was used and the tech took time to explain the process and answer any questions I had. Pricing was fair for high quality glass - a windshield is not something I would suggest going cheap on. You will get what you pay for. I am more than satisfied with Safelite's product and service. Thank you!</review>

This place knows how to take care of you. I had a rock hit my windshield and cracked it so bad I had to get it replaced. The rock hit me on Friday morning, made the appointment that same day for Saturday. I took it right in and it was very fast service. Good waiting room and plenty of fresh coffee or tea for the road. Awesome guys, too.</text>

<Review>Worst Auto glass repair. They repaired the chip and it all cracked after 3-4 days. The shop gave me life time warranty. When I went  back they refused to do the repair or return my money. They do not deserve even 1 star. Third class work and third class shop.< /Review><user_id>113732288354083493975< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

Due to the existing damage compromising the glass, we're not able to determine how the glass will respond to the repair attempt.

We enjoyed the ambiance and the food at Talula's. Went after a matinee with friends. There was quite a crowd, even though it was early, but the staff did a great job. Didn't get to the bar, but it looked like people were really enjoying it there as well. Have recommended it to friends.< /Review>

Wow $500 deductable to replace a cracked windshield on my wife's 2018 Lexus was a bitter bill to pay but Safelite AutoGlass of Stockton did take some of the pain away with the great service and quality insulation they knew what they were doing and we got it right the firstt time with an original equipment windshield from Lexus
Windshields are not all the same they've become very HighTech with front facing cameras lane departure and other safety accessories built into the windshield but working with Safelite AutoGlass we got it right the first time.
Thank you Safelite AutoGlass of Stockton.</Review>

<Text>Jeff showed up on time and was very professional.

Just a heads up, if you have collision cameras and LKAS cameras they can do the Lane Keeping Assist anywhere but the collision camera you will have to take your car in to the actual shop for it to be recalibrated.

Luckily, Brian, was able to squeeze me in and take care of it.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None</resp><review>UTION CAUTION  Future costumers, I have repaired my VERY SMALL crack in my Maxima windshield 7 months ago, today the crack got way way worse . In top of this cheap repair the company does not have warranty on repairs. I feel they intentionally  repair it in this cheap way so after a couple months you come back for replacement which they were extremely happy to do.
(because Of course selling windshields and installing them are better $$ business for them, better than repairing them).
I would advise you from the heart to find a better place to repair your windshield , as i have done it in my other car in different shop couple years ago , and the crack never got worse!! . Honest review from an honest costumer :)<//review><user>108085210116430289032<//user>< Time>

Overall the experience with Safelite went well. They worked well with insurance and the "come to you" option was very convenient. You'll have to book further in advance for that option however.<//Review>

<Review>I had a fine experience with the window glass and materials. However, the agent whom installed the window, treated me like garbage. He belittled me, with total disrespect. Alfonso, should go to Human Relation Classes. It would benefit your company. In all good conciseness, I cannot recommend this company. Too risky.< /Review></record>

They did a decent job on my windshield chip repair, the chip is still very visible but they said that it's normal for that to happen.< /Review>

<Text>Worst windshield repair company ever! Had an appointment to fix my cracked windshield. They came out to my house to start the repairs. By around 11am the employee working on our windshield comes knocking on our door saying he was finished but the catch was he had cracked the new windshield. He said we will get a new one tomorrow due to his mistake I said ok but no his manager had the nerve to call and charge us $400 dollars for a new cracked windshield their guy broke? are they serious their quote said it was $180? Bottom line they need to train there guys and improve management. Customers should be happy with service not disappointed<//Text>< time>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>service was ok. I expected better service from a company such as Safelite .
The lady at the front desk is not very polite. I walked up to the window and and stood there for about a minute before I was acknowledged. I had an appointment and was asked to come in sooner due to cancelations.
I Was asked to wait for a techincian to check me in. I  sat for 20 minutes then i asked again and she said "oh they havent checked you in"?  10 minutes later i was checked in by the tech.

They installed a front wind shield on a 2014 Toyota Avalon. The work was ok. A few minor scratches are visable on the top if the wind shield and some black adhesive streaks were left on the paint (pearl white) highly visible.  The adhesive came of after some scrubbing and the svratches on the glass are only visible from close up.<//Review><response>None</response><user_id>101101014599128420865<//user_id><time>1461809266263<//time><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Aljurio Leyva< /username>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) The worst service I have received from an establishment and one of its employees play with the time of their customers and also question me why I want to change my windshield really do not recommend to the Latino community to use this workshop since we are badly seen

<Response>None</Response><text>This team of amazing HVAC technicians analyzed the condition of my failed 40 year old AC unit, my 16 year old furnace, the attached coil, and duct systems and gave me an honest estimate, fair payment plan with low interest, and regular text updates letting me know when they would arrive. Not only that, but they sent a photo of the technicians and their level of experience and expertise! The technician explained everything with confidence and obvious knowledge and I learned a lot from just talking about my options. They showed up when they said they would, thoroughly planned, ordered, and installed the equipment without delays in one day! The equipment was tested, and working right away! I now have an Energy Star AC unit, more powerful, more efficient, and although I still have more work planned in the Fall to deal with a remodel from a previous owner that didn't remodel the duct system for the increased square footage,  I already have my estimate in my email account and can schedule it whenever I am ready! I am so impressed with the professionalism, the preparedness, and the honesty of this team. If you need HVAC support with your AC, heater, or ducts...you cannot AFFORD to go with a different company! Go call Affordable Air and Heating in Lancaster. Thank you to Isaac, Sean, Johnny, and Jesse for excellent service! Thank you for a fantastic job! ☆☆☆☆☆ Five KatStars from me!</text></record>

I set an appointment with Sean Martin for an AC installation after his initial inspection of our broken AC system. He arrived on time with another professional technician and instantly got to work. Their work was extremely efficient and detail-oriented; Sean always updated me with knowledgeable info about air conditioning, and most importantly, they were kind and helpful. I highly recommend Affordable Air & Heating for any AC repairs and I hope everyone in the Antelope Valley uses his services! We're grateful to have come across his page online!<//review>

This company is so professional and knowledgeable.  My service man, knew exactly what was going on just by my description.  He checked everything out and of course he was right. I've been having issues with my AC since I moved in and I'm happy that the issue will soon be resolved.  I am definitely going to be loyal customer.<//Text>

On 6 Jun at 2 am, we came home and our house was 80 degrees and ac was not working.  We called a lot of other companies and waited for responses but never got any and come to find out a lot of other companies were not providing emergency services for HVAC.  My wife finally called affordable air and after 2 minutes of scheduling a tech, we got 2 emails from her and a picture and a biography of our technician Kenny.  Kenny was there in 22 minutes and he diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes and in 1 hour he had the problem fully diagnosed and he took the time of educate me about preventative maintenance on the unit.  He was professional and very customer focus.  I can see why they named this company affordable air because it was just that.  Kenny was very kind and compassionate about our situation and we are just so happy about the entire experience.  Please give Kenny our sincerest thanks and appreciation for helping us out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
I found affordable Air and Heating using google search after having a prior service from another business I wasn't happy with.  I saw all the great reviews and took a chance. Anthony was extremely polite and professional. He explained what was wrong with my air conditioner and took time to try and fix it even though we knew it might not work because the compressor was bad.  He offered financing for a new compressor, gave us a military discount and immediately set up an appointment to install the unit.  I wish I would have called affordable air and heating before I called thd other place. Thank you!  You've gained a new customer!</Review>

Its 4th of July weekend, and 100 degrees and our Central Air Blower died over the course of 24 hours.  Anthony came out on a holiday to review our problem and give us options on what we could do now (with a 110 degree's in the next week or two) and going forward.  Very professional and straight forward!<//review>

Jereeeme has always been on time and given me quick and realizable service.  This is the 3rd time I’ve used them and can’t complain. Would give them a try if your in the market for AC repair.< /Review>

Jeremee Eisner repaired my broken air conditioner on an extremely hot afternoon. I couldn't believe I could get someone here so fast on the same day! I work from home and I was dreading the thought of having to work in the heat. I was more than pleased!< /Text>

Todd Noshkin was the BEST! Give this man a raise! 😃
We were without AC for a couple of days before realizing our AC was in DESPERATE need of repair.
After calling several companies who were booked/didn't bother calling back i found Affordable Air&Heating and decided to give them a call.
Affordable Air &Heating was quick to send us a technician the same day which was very much appreciated considering it's been in the triple digits the past week. 🥵🥵🥵
Mr. Noshkin arrived on time (within the timeframe given) and was extremely professional, polite, and personable from beginning to end. He recognized that our AC was not going to be a simple fix and took the time to break down and explain everything that needed fixing in simple, easy to understand terms. In addition to our AC repair he also noted another issue that he professionally addressed and took care of. We appreciated so much his honesty and ability to make us feel that the service we were getting was top notch.
Thank you thank you thank you Todd and Affordable Air&Heating...you truly are the best.<//Review>

First spoke with Issac, who came out and inspected our old AC system. He explained the process of how the team would come and change everything out, ducts and AC system. Francisco was the lead for the team that came out. He was extremely courteous and explained everything in detail throughout the installation. Elivis, CJ, & Charlie were members of the team and were all very knowledgeable and professional. With the weather being extremely hot, they never complained.< /text>

I bought a new heating and AC system from this company to replace old systems dating back to 1979(!!!)! They were prompt, courteous and completely professional in all of our contacts. The pricing was fair, the systems they sold me are vey well rated and their installation was skilled and professional.  Hats off and a special shout out to the installers, Tommy, Tony, Sean and Jesse!</review>

< Review>
I needed someone to do maintenance on my AC unit. After asking and looking around for a trusted company I was recommended Affordable Air & Heating. I use to live in Los Angeles and had a very bad experience with another company so I was a little worried about finding someone who is trustworthy. I booked an appointment with Affordable Air and Heating and they sent a very experienced and honest worker Jeremee. He assured me and walked me through everything he was doing. He had a wealth of knowledge and answered all my questions. I could not ask for anyone better than him. I am so delighted with the service I received and will definitely use Affordable Air & Heating for all my AC and Heating needs. You guys just earned a customer for life. Thank you Jeremee,</Review>

I have used this company in the past. I have never been disappointed. My upstairs unit stopped working, of course it was during the hottest day of the summer. The company sent Anthony who was great. By the way I received a text with his name, picture and a short bio of him. He was very professional, knowledgeable. Explained my problem so I could understand. Thanks again Affordable Air for coming to my rescue once again.</Text>

I wasted my time on 2 other companies before I stumbled upon this amazing company. Jeremee arrived on time last night to look at my old wall heater and see if it was fixable. He looked through the whole thing and thank god he did because he measure the CO and found it was emitting some. So yes I needed a new wall heater and I agreed since this one was probably the original one when this house was built in 1957. I received a very reasonable quote and set up a time for it to be put in. This morning Tony and Francisco arrived on time and went to work in putting in a whole new wall heater, new thermostat and new venting. They did a beautiful job and cleaned up all the mess (which most companies do not do that anymore!) They answered all my questions and explained everything about this new unit to me. I am so thoroughly impressed with this company. Jeremee, Tony and Francisco thank you!!! Anyone reading this please do not waste your time with anyone else. This company is it!!< /Text>

They serviced my AC 4 months ago and for a lot of extra money, I should allow them fill my system with a Freon stop leak product. I ask how long this product would last and he said as long as I owned the system. Well it lasted 4 months. They came out today and charged me $50 to tell me the system was complete empty. Real nice folks. I now have to purchase a new AC. But I won’t be using these people again.</review>

<Text>Amazing Company & Technitian Anthony Gonzalez

Anthony Gonzalez  is proffessional, great customer service, respectful, always courteous, always on time. Know how to work with kids around. Great communication.  Always wears mask.
Company work with Customers schedule.

Anthony Gonzalez technitian and other technicians have worked on my AC & heater and has always been  an incredible service.

The company keeps you updated before technitian arrives they txt you a picture of technition that is schedule to come to to your home.

Fyi, I highly recommend their maintenance package always good to have.

I personally have home warranty with a different company, I rather call Affordable Ac & Heating instead of my own home warranty company for any AC & Heating issues.

Extremely Satisfied with service

Look when it comes to AC your mainly worried about being cheated because you need the Ac and that’s the truth .

I will forever be an Affordable Air & Heating Customer. They sent Anthony and Jeremee out and he was a complete professional and didn’t push any service I didn’t want. His knowledge of what was happening made me feel at ease in making my decision to fix my Ac.

Thanks Guys</text>

Anthony, the Service Manager of Affordable Air, showed up early Sunday morning of the 5th of July and quickly resolved my air conditioner problem. He was very professional, courteous, and thoroughly answered all my questions. I had recently done “research” on YouTube but I ended up with more questions than answers.
My takeaway from YouTube is that some problems are better handled by professionals’, especially when dealing with lethal voltages and costly rookie mistakes.
All in all, it was a positive experience. My thanks to Anthony and Affordable Air.

They all wore booties the entire day even with having to be in and out of my house! I was very impressed with the customer service I received especially with the office staff. They called me the day before to confirm my appointment, and the day of to let me know they were on their way to my home. I cant wait to use my air conditioner this summer!!!!

Both technicians (Jessie and his younger co-worker) acted in a professional manner. Fast, equitable price and cleaned up after the job was done. Any future needs will be done by Affordable Air!
I forgot to mention that I called another service in Lancaster that quoted me 5 times more the cost and tried to sell me items I did not need.< /text>

I have had a really good experience with Affordable Air & Heating and Anthony as the technician.  He is knowledgeable and personal and has a great professional demeanor and work ethic.  If you want to get your heater working, mixed with a technician who is top notch, pick Affordable AIr Heating nd Air and ask for Anthony.   You will be extremely happy with the results.  Don't say I didn't tell you first.

<Text>We've called them twice, for different issues. The first time, the tech was there within 2 hours, and fixed the problem within minutes. The second time, the tech came the next morning, right on time, and saw what the problem was within seconds. Both were very nice and helpful, and very clear about what was wrong and how to fix it. Highly recommend them for anything you need!!!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I called Affordable Air about a heater problem. From what I reported over the phone, Michael showed up on time with 2 possible diagnoses.  The cheaper of the two turned out to be the issue!  He fixed the problem quickly, tested the repair multiple times, and cleaned up thoroughly.  Five stars.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1487990352356, 'text': "Dan,\nI appreciate you taking the time to leave a review.\nI'm glad Michael was able to repair your furnace quickly and affordably.\nMichael takes great pride in what he does and respects your home.

<Text>I have had a pleasant experience with Affordable Air and heating. I had multiple service calls from another company to service my swamp cooler, needless to say I continued to get charged but the job was not done correct. Same goes for my gas heaters. found out the same company put in the wrong part that doesn't match the heater and now affordable is assisting me in correcting that Issue. They have been awesome.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Our experience with Affordable Air was simply outstanding! First they were able to come to our home very quickly, and second Mr. Gravance was expertly able to diagnose the AC problem quickly and efficiently, offering frank advice along the way.  Highly Recommended!  Thank you!<//Text>

Over priced. The quality of work is below average and the installation i received was a hack job. Jesse was great as far as customer service but the rest of the staff in the field as well as the office are no better than actors  pretending to be an hvac company. Dont waste ur money with these guys.< /text>

Fantastic  are awesome! their closing time and they gave fantastic customer service; I didn't feel the least bit rushed. They helped me find a new pair of boxing gloves and threw in the free hand wraps as well, plus a free pay to keep them in.<//Review>

Good cut but not going back. Went in for a simple length cut. Asked specifically how much it was going to be. The women clearly understood what I wanted and quoted me a price. At no time during the cutting was anything mentioned that it was harder than expected. But when I went to pay they wanted $5 more because of the length and thickness of hair. This was after looking at it before starting and giving me a price. I understand things happen but it would have been nice to know it was a problem once she started. Like I stated above she did a good job but should have informed me it was going to be more once she knew she was having an issue. They made $5 more but will not earn more from me. I have to question whether or not they understand exactly what they are doing if they are off 33% on an estimate of a simple straight cut.< /review>

As I got here I was not greeted until after they were done throwing trash. taking a break then their prices do not match what their website posts and they depends on the length of your hair whether they charge an extra $5 then she used the same brush without even taking  the other person's hair out before starting mine poor customer service never will return to this location< /Text>

<Review>Came down for the first time about a month ago. There was a young lady who assisted me and I explained what I wanted and she over exceeded my expectations. She knew what she was talking about and it showed, unfortunately I didn’t get her name. I went back just yesterday in hopes of getting the same experience and the young lady wasn’t there. Instead I was greeted by Rosa who made me feel as though I wasn’t capable of signing in a simple sheet of paper. She decided to take me and I told her I wanted color, and I wanted a trim for my A line cut. I asked her to do my shortest layer from the back where my hair started and long in the front. I must add she told me in order to get the hair color I wanted I needed to bleach the hair and it faded quickly. It wasn’t the process I didn’t like, it was the way she Presented it. If I want to pay someone to kill my hair, I do appreciate the process explained to me which is to be expected, but this lady made it seem as she didn’t want to do it. So I made up my mind I’d take my color and get it elsewhere. My haircut was the worst, I ended up with a bob that made me look like Edna from the incredibles rather than an A line. She was way to distracted by everyone coming in through the door and at the end, she still asked if I wanted layers! If she would have bothered to pay attention, she would have heard the key word “layer” when I told her where I wanted the shortest to be. Now I have to pay someone else to fix the disaster she did. To the owners, please make sure your staff can handle multi tasking, if not please don’t put them in charge! I would never go back and allow Rosa to touch my hair again!</Review>< Gmap_id>

Horrible! Around 2 years ago, I went to get my hair done. I wanted a balayage ombré. I went before I scheduled a date and time, to ask if it was something they could do. I also mentioned I worked later shift that day and if that time frame was enough to get the hair job done. Without hesitation and after looking at my hair length, I was told it was enough time to have the hair colored just the way I wanted it. I show up and they started working on my hair. Hours went by and I wasn’t even near to finishing. Not only that, as I’m looking at my hair process, I was iffy about how the technique was done. Even then, I confused in what they had said. Turns out, they messed up hair bad! This lady did a line right across, no blending! She tried to blend and ended up adding random lines, in hopes it would blend! Horrible! She then starts saying she didn’t know I had that much hair and she needed time, which I specifically told her even on that day, that I had work if it wasn’t enough time I could see another day that would work for us. Nope! That was her excuse! I wanted to cry! To top it off she didn’t even add toner! She charged me more than 150 and told me that the toner would blend my hair. She expected me to come back and pay for toner, an additional 30 or more. When I got home I noticed that even to put it in a high bun, the random streaks were so noticeable! I began to cry! I had to get redone, at a way higher price but it was left the way I wanted it in the first place. The girl that redid my hair noticed how much I was shaking throughout the whole process and explained how they did not use a technique to create a balayage rather just added random streaks thinking it’d blend. Worst place ever!!!!!! I am writing this because the lady that messed up hair still works there! 😡< /Text>

<review>I was here about fifteen minutes ago for a cut and style. I have major curls and frizz and all I wanted was for them to give me a suitable cut for my hair type and help me with the frizz. the lady I spoke with (older Hispanic lady with short hair) told me she wouldn't straighten my hair it would take too much time I tried explaining to her that I didn't want it straight she kept cutting me off saying no she couldn't and in the end told me go tell the other lady and walked away. after a few mins she spoke with the other lady (blonde eastern european) and she told her that I didn't know what I wanted and she didn't know if they could help me because I have curly hair, the blonde said it's not her turn yet so it doesn't matter. I've never been treated this way at a salon I waited for my ride to come back and am on my way to another place who will take my money and treat me with a bit of respect and professionalism<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Two things, first and formost Jessica is awesome. I've been there a few times and she does a great job and is super sweet. I dont usually go to salons to get my hair did, but I like her style. Second thing, OMG it's so flippin hot in there! I feel bad for the entire staff having to stand in there all day with all the chemicals making it even hotter. I mean, why doesn't this place have better ac? Do the customers mean nothing to this business owner? And the employees? You would think that they would upgrade the ac for the employees! But nooppee.  Ugh it's bad. I think someone needs to do something about that. And my 5 star rating is for Jessica not fantastic sams.<//review>

The washing machines work great, the dryers not so much. All vending machines are down, and have open sodas and open pizza bags  in the soda dispensary. Also, I tried getting quarters from my dimes from the lady in charge, and she told me no. It has to be dollar bills. Your change is obviously not accepted here. I had to drive off to obtain more change because I didn't have enough but was already washing. I had about 10 dollars worth of dimes and nickels.< /review>

Normally I go the the wash house next door, never noticing this one until the other day. It was crowded at my usual spot so I came over here to dry right quick. Never again! Put 50 minutes in and clothes were still damp. Then after I put the coins in I noticed a signed that said if you don't wash here, cant dry here. Any business knows MONEY IS MONEY but to each its own. Anyway, won't be going back. 50 minutes is more than enough to dry for two small loads.</text>

I left my rugs by accident because they were closing and went back the next morning and they stole my good rugs and left me my cheaper rugs. Definitely won't be going back ... Plus it's way to many roaches and when I came home it was one that I've seen on my clothes</review>

Today was alright. But the one lady that's there during the day most day's is rude and I can't hardly stand being there when she is. The blonde lady at night is a sweet heart and the Young one in rhe day is also very nice. But the older one in the day morning is bad. I've left more then once because she is so rude and lazy. I spend a lot of money there every week. I buy their soap, bags, softener, and use their massage chairs and play the games.< /text>

The hours of operations say open till 11pm I arrived here at 9 o'clock and I'm not able to wash the lady says last wash is at 8:30 this makes no sense to be open till 11 o'clock if I cannot come in and start wash 9pm. I only had two quick loads.  After I was turned away I noticed a couple going in to wash laundry she must have known them I think all rules should apply to everybody.  Once  She noticed I was upset she was trying to allow me to wash but by then I had already found another location it was Completely unprofessional I'm not sure what your idea of businesses is but we are in the business to make money not turn away customers.</review>

They are in the unsafest place of San Bernardino, be very vigilant if you happen to come here they have a limited big washers and then people leave their clothes behind and no one wants to remove so others can use inconvenience for other customers same with dryers it's crazy they know how busy they get on weekend yet it seems like washers don't work,dryers sucks they use to have a restroom and charged 25cents the reason was due to vandalism and keep the restroom open but has been closed now, they have massage chairs like the ones at the mall nice, vending machines available as well but there's also a 711 right next door for your convenience, not the cleanest I would say and the parking should have more light it gets too dark and unsafe they should seriously consider this,they have rides for the kids but some don't work and no one is responsible for that either,so if you ever go there go in the day time but remain vigilant< /text>

This laundry mat is  super expensive. Machines require you use there prepaid card. Which you need to buy. Washing machines are good. Dryers suck though. I wasted so much money. Not worth coming here.< /text>

They usually have an attendant on duty who is helpful and courteous. It's clean and has a lot of machine's so you can usually find one to wash your clothes in plus they have arcade game's, table's & chairs, free wi-fi and best of all coffee. I like that I can go online and get my school work done while also doing my laundry. I feel like I get two chore's done at once. It's a great time saver.< /text>

Change machine and alot of washers didn't work and were quite expensive. My friend found $5 on her way back from getting change at place next door. She said thats the only thing that made it worth going. She paid $1 for 3 loads that was $6.<//Review>

Horrible!!! Our laundry has been stuck/locked inside of a malfunctioning washing machine for over an hour and there is no attendant on site to help, nor are there any phone numbers displayed for the business to call for help. The dryers dont dry the clothes, had to move wet clothes to different dryers and pay again for it.  This place is definitely bad - please dont use this laundromat- unless you want to over pay to use broken machines and have your clothes held hostage in a malfunctioning washing machine.  The owners/operators of this establishment obviously dont care about the patrons.< /Text>

This rating is very specifically for the palm tree outside in the parking lot. It was worth every star. The shade was just right. A little light came through in bits. So amazing.</text>

Love that this location is close to my house. Large deli, meat and seafood section has many selections. Everything is spread out and aisles are roomy. Clean store and everything looks really fresh and organized!< /Review>

It is a standard vons grocery store. It is large in size with an average stock. The prices are not the best but also not the worst. Where this store lacks is in the cashier's there are never enough people on register, and there is always a line despite it being busy or not expect to wait.<//text>

Always clean, kind service.  I love how nice the staff is and always willing to help.  I love coming here!  Most prices are better than other locations, a few are the same.  Great price on gluten free items.  I just wish they hot more Pamela's GF flour in!< /Text>

Gets a bit crowded at times in the Meat and Produce sections but otherwise social distancing easy. Always love the $5 Friday deals, but go early before inventory out.< /Review>

Deli- Whole Chicken old and dry.  Its 5 pm and thete wad only 2 bags of chicken.   This should be full with fresh food.

Self checking had issues and the clerk was on phone and there was other customer's waiting for help too.  I finally left and went to a checkstand for service.   No, I would not go back.</text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Horrible experience here when the cashier charged me for the wrong item and tried to return it or exchange it I should say cause I just wanted what I originally had asked to be rung up for but gave me the worst experience by not helping me do the exchange or return and just left me with an item I didn't want. Manager was sympathetic and just not being friendly or caring about my situation when I explained it was out of my control nor was I responsible for this mistake made on my purchase when the employee who charged me was the one responsible for charging me the incorrect item asked. It was just a whole big complicated mess where I left unsatisfied and very unhappy with my purchase and wasn't very helpful either when it came down to my situation.  Horrible way to leave a local customer without any help or any repercussions to support me. Felt terrible and as if I did this to myself without even doing anything at all. A and situation left unresolved for me and left me feeling so cheated and unsatisfied without a doubt</Review>< Pics>

The store is VAST. I imagine you could find just about anything you want to eat in there. However, in many cases their prices are higher than good old Stater Bros. Their staff was friendly and helpful, though.</Text>

Nice over all large store. The set up is different than most stores. The produce is in the front middle of the Store and it seemed a bit small but it could be the store, I don't know..I kind of like it.</review>

Been shopping here for years. I wish they would be better about restocking produce bags. I usually end up having to walk around the produce section looking for bags.< /review>

Vons is awesome and combine the online coupons u can add to ur card before ur shopping trip and sometimes I get up to $.50 cents off a gallon at the Vons gas station. I can’t find a place where I feel like I’m getter a better bang for my buck</Text>

I'm not one to leave reviews unless I have had a particularly striking experience, but I've been on the phone with this store for over 20 minutes speaking to likely the most incompetent customer service staff I've ever encountered. A majority of my questions have been answered with "I don't know", to which I have to follow up and say "Are you able to find out?". And now...I've just been hung up on.</Review>

$5 Fridays!

Pavilions, owned by Vons, is a more upscale supermarket.  Fortunately, sale prices are good at both locations.

The layout is easy to decipher and the entirety of the store is kept clean and neat.  A pharmacy, deli, butcher, Starbucks and fresh sushi are on hand to make a one stop shop experience.

What brings me in are $5 Fridays.  From chicken wings to meatloaf, many a deal are to be had for just $5. Another enticement is clearance diving for any good finds I may spot.  Great for finding dinner!

Service has been good.  The deli employees are really great with gathering up what I need.  Parking is in a private lot, shared by Rite Aid and other businesses.

Pavilions is a great place to fulfill your grocery needs.  $5 Fridays are a great way to save & prices are competitive with other markets.

A fully stocked grocery store with a pharmacy, bakery, florist, and deli.  There is also a Starbucks just inside the right-hand entrance so you can get your caffeine fix while you shop.

The manager of the bakery can be a bit brusque in how she speaks.  She is not quite rude but is also not entirely open and welcoming.  Their products are good but if a pleasant human interaction is important to your bakery experience you might wish to get your baked goods elsewhere.< /text>

<text>The pharmacist tech Sylvia is always rude, never approached me, the person waiting behind me was wondering, too, if she was going to be helped since she was just talking to the other pharmacist without even acknowledging us or saying at least "I'll be right with you". She make me wait 1 hour today over a 20 minute wait to tell me my order was not ready. I told her she could've told me that or called me but she never did, instead she started yelling at me and tell me there was no other option than that...when I turned around there was a line again. Terrible customer service, she could've just be polite and save my time.< /text><user_name>Jennie Galang<//user_name>< Pics>

The store is set up very nicely and we'll stocked.  The customer service is very friendly.  Subtracting 1 point because in their fresh beef selection, everytime I go, half of the meat on the shelf has already turned brown.  Otherwise it's a very nice store, especially the floral section / selection.<//Text>

My go-to store!
It's now 2020 and I love their Drive Up and Go service. If you are vulnerable, health wise, they can do the shopping for you. Order online, reserve a pickup time (usually a few hours) and let them know when you get to the park spot reserved for this service. I noticed that the vegetables and fruits seem to be fresher than those I get from the shelves. Thank you for service, Vons!</Text>

Von's in my opinion caters to some, and not other customers. Very cold and unwelcoming disposition towards some loyal customers , in my shared opinion it appears to be profiling of some sort.... Not every customer service rep, but a vast majority on them conform on occasions. Needs customer service skill improvements. .....Please!!!!
Leave personal feelings at home, and stop judging others possibly because of who they are naturally. Disclaimer: Just my shared opinion.< /Review>

It was better when this was an upscale Pavilions it was a lot cleaner but more expensive. Look like the floors need a good mop job. Why are the employees so rude in this store? I'm never coming back.</review>

<text>The reason why I'm given the store three stars is not because of the stories because of the people and I'm talking about the people that shop there I'm so disappointed in everyone we are selfish people you supposed to get what you need and leave some for others I'm so sad right now😣😢😢😭😭😭😭</text></record>

<Review>The employees are friendly here. I am not good about ad shopping or cutting coupons, so I can't honestly say how the prices compare, but I like a clean store that has all of my family's favorites. The convenience of having Rite Aid and Tuesday Morning in the same shopping center makes for one-stop shopping. The reason I don't do 5 stars is not the employees' faults, it's district offices that cut back on staff hours making it difficult to get anyone to help if you have a question or a return. In my days of working the grocery business, there was a customer service counter (that had someone always there) that helped with all of that. Now, you have to stand around waiting a long time for someone to come up and help you or you have to interrupt cashiers who are trying to help get lines down in the checkout lanes. Not good for customer service.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>It's funny writing a review for a grocery store... it's so everyday and common that I didn't think it needed a review. But like restaurants and other service industries, the people need to know what to expect when they glide past the sliding doors! Since this is a Pavillions (an extra posh version of a Safeway or Vons), it includes a Starbucks, a full bakery, a full deli, a full butcher, a full florist, and a sushi chef! It's got everything! The cashiers are all really friendly and they always have plenty of courtesy clerks available to help find anything. It's a big store so they have a lot of options on the shelves that the smaller stores don't have. VERY large alcohol selection.</Review>< rate>

The store eliminated the express lane. It gets old waiting behind customers with large carts when I have 5 items.

Follow up- express lane has returned as of 1/31. Thank you!</text>

Stopped by for soup this morning and was told it would be ready in 30 to 45 minutes.  Hung around and came back well over an hour and saw that the soup bar was still not stocked.  High expectations was met with non-delivery of a service.  My rating is really no stars.<//Text>

Pallets in the aisles, not enough trained checkers, some cold shelves not properly faced, no one in the produce section. Manager needs to walk their store more often.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I am very sorry I could not give it the 5 stars, but yesterday Wednesday May 20 at night I bought Blackberries and they were not in good condition, I did not want to keep them to show them, it was my fault for not checking them, but vons is a good quality store and not I thought it necessary, regarding their employees they were all friendly.

(Original)
