Found this place one day as I was leaving town on a Sunday. They were the only place open on a Sunday so I stopped by to get a flat fixed and also asked the mechanic to check my fluids before I embark on my road trip. Nothing but positivity and great work. As my vehicle was finished, the Boss came out and spoke to me about my tires and how far my trip was going to be. She said I needed new tires and that my vehicle would get better MPG  and overall would ride smoother with these new tires. I was sold on them!

Long story short, I told her I'd be back in a few weeks and that I'd love to get all four tires. Ended up getting the Falken Wildpeak AT Trail and I absolutely love them! I got them mounted and balanced and even an alignment. Ever since that day, I've been coming here ever since. Amazing work, and great customer service.

I commute often down to Southern California and stop by Pacific Tire every time!

You can't beat Pacific Tire Co!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Great place if your looking to replace a flat tire. They were fast and the price was reasonable. A tire shop around the corner wanted $80 for a used tire and I got a better tire at this place for $40. I would highly recommend this place. They speak Spanish but all the employees also speak English. Doesn't look like much on the outside but they have a good selection of new and used tires.</Review></record>

Workers are cool, but I think they really need to fire Gloria inside as she does not seem to care about the customers. 🤦‍♂️ or even cares ro listen. Terrible customer service, but awesome work 🤙</Review>

< Review>
I came here out of desperation. I was on my way to LA for a trip for a concert. My dumb butt forgot to change one of the tires before we left Arizona. Luckily our bad tire made it to civilization when it ended up shredded. To make a long story short, we ended up getting help from roadside assistance who put my spare on and urged me to get to a tire shop immediately. I was so scared and had no idea where I was or who to trust. I ended up at this little place. They got me in and gave me a brand new tire for super cheap in less than 15 minutes when I was really pressed for time and concerned about money. They were so kind and fluent in English and Spanish, which I have major respect for since I only speak English. They worked fast and after a very stressful couple of hours trying to get roadside assistance in an unfamiliar area, made me feel hopeful and excited about my trip again. I’m so glad I came to this shop, they are trustworthy and fast. They made me feel so relieved when I had been sobbing that my trip was ruined just before this. I can never thank them enough for what they did for me, but I hope this business thrives and continues for years to come. They deserve it.< /Review>

Today however, went beyond that. My boyfriend and I were changing my mom's brakes, but the lug nuts were bolted in too tightly. We called Pacific Tires, and asked if they would do us the favor of loosening them, and they kindly agreed.
Without making any kind of money, they helped us out so much. Thanks guys!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5</Rate></record>

I needed a nail removed from my tire and the tire patched. I made the mistake of going to Firestone first- they told me it would be a 2-3 hour wait with 4 technicians working and only one car on a rack. While Firestone went to look at my car and tire, I called Pacific Tire. Pacific Tire said usually it is 15 minutes to patch a tire. I left Firestone and went to Pacific Tire. They removed the donut, patched the regular, put it on the car, and stowed the donut in about 10th  minutes. It also only cost $15. I will definitely be back when I replace my tires!<//Review>

<text>Was quoted $30 to get two tires repaired. I asked if that included balancing and he said it did.  One tire was not repairable and he offered to sell a used tire for $50 which I agreed.

I watched them repair my other tire and while they were in process of reinstalling onto car I asked about rebalancing.  The guy said "this was the repaired tire," like repaired tires don't need rebalancing.  Any reputable tire store always rebalances the wheel after the tire has been removed and reinstalled. He then offered to rebalance for an extra $5. Rather than argue over $5, I agreed.  What else can go wrong?

Well, after rebalancing the wheel he proceeded to install on car and tighten the lug nuts with his impact wrench.  Now, it's ok to remove lug nuts with an impact wrench (they're fast), and ok to install with impact wrench and lighty torque the nuts, but final torque should always be applied with a calibrated hand torque wrench as all reputable tire stores do.   Over-torquing with an impact wrench can damage threads or warp brake rotors, and under-torquing can cause lug nuts and wheels to fall off.  I asked if he was going to apply final torque with a torque wrench and he looked at me like "hey my job's done."  After further pushing I found out the shop did not even own a torque wrench!    And this is a place that also advertises such services as brakes, differential repairs and more.. All requiring specific torque values of components for proper repair.  Unbelievable!!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c32de095233f6d:0x68120d99f349fc67< /Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Bad experience is a bit cheating the workers do not know the other people who work inside the office are the same but the experience that I had with the operators outside It was very bad they want to charge you for the mistakes they make for example they swept a nut of my tire and they wanted to charge me $ 7 plus $ 3 to replace a Turkish that they swept

(Original)
Mala experiencia son un poco tramposos los trabajadores no se la demás personas que trabajen dentro de la oficina sean igual pero la experiencia que yo tuve con los operadores afuera Fue muy mala te quieren cobrar por los errores ellos cometen por ejemplo barrieron una tuerca de mi llanta y me querían cobrar $7 más $3 por reemplazar una turca que ellos barrieron</Review>

(Translated by Google) The only good thing was that I was able to grab a used tire on Sunday but I spoke on the phone early to see if they had a tire size and they told me they did and when I got there they told me they didn't have it for that reason I give them two stars

(Original)
Lo único bueno fue que pude agarrar una llanta usada en domingo pero hablé por teléfono temprano para ver si tenían una medida de llanta y me dijeron que sí la tenían y cuando llegué ahí me dijeron que no la tenían por esa razón les doy dos estrellas<//text>

< Review>
We Needed urgent repair to water supply line to toilet.  to our relief, Crown Plumbing sent someone that day.  The replacement of the valve was more complicated than expected so John stabilized the problem and had to come back the next day and repaired the problem quickly and effectively.  The experience was exactly how one would want to have a plumbing problem repaired.  We would definitely call Crown Plumbing first.<//Review>

John,  the plumber was excellent!  He was professional, knew what he was doing. He just did a wonderful job on installing a very difficult hot water heater. I will be giving his name and Crown Plumbing  to all my friends snd business partners!< /review>

Made my day and helped my family!
Our sewage had issue that had clogs causing dirty water flow back up. John and Patrick were really professional and due diligence. They made fast work of the repair, and went above and beyond helping me troubleshoot, analysing, gathering video, photo reports and resolved the issues.

I would recommend this company again!< /Review>

Crown was professional when they showed up within 2 hours of me calling. We only have one toilet for our business and they came right over and fixed the issue. I would even use them for my house if needed (hope not but you never know). I will recommend them  and give them  10 stars if possible.< /text>

They came they left. Now I owe them $60 for no service.
Crown was sent by an home insurance company that would not let Crown replace the toilet so they left. I'm working with Crown Plumbing now to work on a fix. They're good talented people.< /text>

I believe our technician was Robert, but I am not so great with remembering names. He was fast and knowledgable, I’d recommend Crown to anyone. Ours was a home warranty call for potential water damage, and a leaking sink. The sink was fixed quickly, and we were able to determine that the water marks on our ceiling were not from active leaks. Very relieving.<//Review>

We used our home warranty and they sent out a different company who left my bathroom a mess and the sink still clogged said they'd follow up and never did after almost a week. Called home warranty and they sent out Crown Plumbing.

They were timely, profession and my bathroom wasn't a disaster after they were done. Best of all my sink works.<//Review>

<review>John the technician went above and beyond to help us with our clogged toliet!! When no one else could find our main sewer line, he went around the neighbor hood asking neighbors where theirs was so he could get a general idea where mine could be. Then when it came time to look for mine, which was inside my garden bed, he went digging for it! And he found it!! He really did a wonderful job and was able to fix our plumbing issue and save us hundreds of dollars because if he didnt find the main Sewer line then we would have to rip out our toliet to access the pipe! He did a wonderful job and because of him I would defiently use this company again!!<//review></record>

<Review>I had a plumbing problem for 4 days in 106 degrees without water , it was pretty tough. The home warranty company I've got was  able to get Crown Plumbing on  my behalf.
They got in touch with me immediately and let me know when the employee was gonna be out that afternoon as he  got closer he gave me a call and let me know he was within a few minutes of showing up. I really appreciate the hard work that was done by the rep it was fixed within 2 hours and I have my running water backs a thank you so much.< /Review><time>1594829679196< /time>< Pictures>

<Name>S Bara1</Name><review>Crown is not what I expected but in a very very very good way! They are professional, from the initial service call to the finish. Got a call about an hour after placing call from the service tech to discuss what was going on, so he could better understand the problem before arriving. Text message from them 30 minutes before arrival and done in 45 minutes. Oh and they landed under the estimate. Would definitely use them again when needed.</review>< Rating>

Absolutely great experience with Crown Plumbing. Had a leak from my sink and couldn’t figure where. John from Crown showed up (they alerted me by  text when they were coming) and figured out the problem. He went to work and fixed it in about 25 minutes.  This is the first time I needed a plumber to my house and will be using them from now on!< /Review>

<review>I had a broken outdoor faucet that wouldn't turn off. I looked for a handyman type on-line but decided on Crown Plumbing, which was five star and in the neighborhood (I haven't had that good of luck with "handymen"). A technician arrived within an hour but did not have the proper part. He left, acquired the part, and then installed it in less than an hour for the quoted fee. The work appears to be excellent. I will call them again next time I need plumbing service, which I undoubtedly will.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809adc424b4440c3:0x5099b30a28c7985f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had a critical issue my old water heater stopped working and began to leak in my home.  John was not only punctual but extremely knowledgeable and helpful at helping me understand the problem the repairs that would be needed.  John also did an exceptional job at installing new water heater and doing all of the required upgrades.  I would highly recommend Crown Plumbing their prices are reasonable and well worth the quality of service provided.<//Review>

I requested Crown and they were responsive within a day to schedule, John (the tech from Crown) came out the next day and took care of the issue.  We were so grateful.

This was a home warranty water heater call.  I was so suppressed to be called  back with in and hour of placing the services call.   Even more supersized that they would be sending a tech over the next day.  If it was for the long weekend they would have replaced my water heater the next day.   John was our professional plumber. He notified us he was on his way and on time  great guy.  I would use Crown for In and out of warranty service.</review>

<review>I have had Crown Plumbing out twice for two different issues through my home warranty company. Both times the technicians have been stellar.

This time, Derrick was my technician and he was awesome: friendly, patient with my yappy dogs, and he went above and beyond and worked tirelessly on a very difficult job to help me avoid having to replace the toilet.

I would not hesitate to use them again and highly recommend them.<//review>< Pictures>

<Time>1588183774135</Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I called this company to come out to look at a problem with a plugged toilet. They quoted me $249.00 to just come out to look at the problem, which seems outrageous to me. The plumber arrived and stated that he needed to remove a toilet to fix the problem. He called his office and now they wanted $479.00 to complete the job. I did not want to have the service done and he left. Today I get a bill for $149.00 and they did nothing. This company is highway robbery and I will be reporting them to the BBB. Buyer Be Ware.<//text>< pictures>

I first met with them through my home warranty when the first people they sent out failed to do the job right or at for that matter.  The first tech the sent out found some roots under my toilet so he called owner Walter. Walter came out a d shot it really to on what it could take and how much to fix the problem. He was awesome and worked with us as we are not rich and have 3 kids to care for. He told me he would come back and camera the pipes when the worker was there so I could see what they see no games. Then Patrick came out and he was AWESOME he did what he needed to do and Walter did come out like he said he would and we camera's the line and it wasnt as bad as it look and they were able to fix it without tearing up my concrete. Patrick put it back together perfectly. My toilet sits flush with the floor (it wobbled a little) and it works GREAT!!!! To top it all of Walter walked around the outside of my house with me and I showed me where i show put root killer and thing to help prevent this from happening again. I just want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. You guys are AMAZING<//Review>< Date>

It's been an incredible experience working with the Crown Team. I'll be a reference anytime. They got our home's repiping done on schedule under a tight window between Thanksgiving and Christmas 2019. It was complicated because of the water damage from the defective KITEC piping but the job was completed in 3 weeks elapsed time. All in all, we ended up in our home in time for Christmas as promised. Great work all around.</Review>

<Review>I contacted them on a Saturday. Since this wasn't an emergency, they scheduled my appointment for Monday between the hours of 8:00 - 11:00 am but they probably will be here closer to 8:00 am. On Monday the technician was here at 8:00 am. and he was done in about 15 minutes. I was impressed with the professionalism of the scheduler and the technician.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809adc424b4440c3:0x5099b30a28c7985f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The actual service was fine but it took almost 10 days to get the technician here. Not sure if it was Crown or my Home Warranty but I had to call Crown multiple times and was told every time that they submitted the paperwork to the home warrenty com and they never received.<//review>

These guys don't get enough credit...Usually the only time someone calls a plumber is when something is broken or a huge mess, which I am guilty of. Crown Plumbing has bailed me out of numerous messes and always seem to make me feel like I'm the only one on their schedule.  They have always been prompt, on time and very respectful while in my house.
And to top it off they can handle anything water or sewer related.
Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>First off the plumber was scheduled to show up from 11-2 and didn’t show up till 2:30 or so. Then he was very rude about the whole situation of clearing my sinks. I would recommend a different plumber if you get the technician Alex. He was my tech was rude shows up late and doesn’t apologize nor does he clean up his mess. Took me over a half hour to clean the mess he caused in my bathroom. Don’t recommend them at all if all the technicians act like this.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

We had an issue with our tankless water heater and have a home warranty. Crown Plumbing was assigned the job through the home warranty service. It took 4+ visits to get our new hot water heater installed,  as the technician, Richard obviously was  not knowledgeable on how  to complete the install (this was confirmed by one of the owners). We were informed we needed to have a GFI installed and had an electrician out to install. Then upon Richard's return visit we were told it was not done correctly and needed installed outside the garage: After having the electrician out for a 2nd time which included an additional charge, the outlet was installed outside of the garage. Richard came out again and we were told it was still not done correctly. Had there been clear communication on what work was needed, we would not have incurred two unnecessary charges for electrical service. Upon the install of the new hot water heater, ( by a technician other than Richard) we are not getting hot water for more than a few minutes to the upstairs shower, tub and faucets.  Our home warranty assigned another plumbing company to check our valves to make sure that was not the problem ( Crown Plumbing thought it might be the issue). The other plumbing company concluded the issue was with the new hot water heater.
Richard from Crown Plumbing came out today and never let me know he was here and never came into the house to run the shower or faucets to see what the problem was.  He reported to his company that he was at my home and ran the hot water and everything is fine. How do you assess an issue without communicating with the homeowner or come into the house?  We still do not have hot water for more than a few minutes and Crown Plumbing has failed to resolve this issue. It has been over 5 weeks and our issue is not resolved and we still do not have hot water for more than a few minutes. We were charged an additional $1068 by Crown Plumbing for additional parts and labor and we still do not have a hot water heater that works properly. We are very dissatisfied with the lack of service provided by this company. I would never recommend this company to anyone.<//review>

<text>In my experience, it has been very difficult to find a plumbing contractor who I can trust. Walt and his crew did an excellent job with my home addition/remodel. They not only did all the laborious plumbing for my remodel, but they also did all the little things (such as cleaning up after themselves at the end of the day or suggesting ideas that I never thought about.) I can absolutely say with 100% certainty that these guys were fair and honest with everything that they did for me. I will never use another plumbing contractor. Crown plumbing is my plumber for life!<//text><pics>None</pics>< name>

So, Crown sent out a second plumber, Richard, who was able to locate the problem, fix it and offer suggestions for follow-up. Crown got the job done.<//text>< gmapID>

From Tankless water heaters to moving gas lines, I know I can always count on a quality job at a fair price. Walter and his crew are dependable and take the time to discuss the job before it begins. Upon completion, the site is left in the same condition it was before the work started. I highly recommend using Crown Plumbing for your next plumbing job.<//review>

Crown Plumbing came in after the initial repipe plumber made a mess of the  patching & texturing. They did an excellent job repairing and texturing   the walls. Now that I have painted you cannot see where the openings were.< /text>

<review>Horrible customer service. If you have an issue that needs to be addressed promplty be prepared for several excuses as to why they cant call insurance (which takes 5 minutes) to complete. I was told " well i have 1000 things to do on my desk" as the reasoning as to why they haven't called me back ( and ive called 3 times and each time was told i would be called back that day and wasnt) Ive been waiting 3 weeks for them to come back and finish the job. Taking my business elsewhere.<//review><user_id>105505017924950919932<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>DO NOT use this company if you have a serious plumbing issue! My upstairs bathroom leaked into wall and down to bottom floor causing a hole in downstairs ceiling. Took crown 3 days for emergency call out. Came, didnt fix problem...actually made worse by replacing hardware wrong causing tub to not turn all way off. Called them back..6 DAYS for a return visit to fix all the problems! Hole in ceiling big enough to put my hand in now, water dripping through walls, and tub constantly on! Oh...and they couldnt even be bothered to call me back after learning they had not fixed the issue. Doubting ill get my money back! Im telling everyon i can find on all social media...avoid crown plumbing at all cost!<//text>< time>

Best box in town! Joined as a drop-in for several classes as someone coming from Germany and visiting California. I enjoyed working out here due to the vibe, people, trainings and equipment. Centrally located!</review>

Very welcoming to drop ins.  Coach Adam was personable, knowledgeable and very accommodating. Space was kinda tight and  you can't drop the bar.  Small price to pay for a good gym and great atmosphere.  8/10 would go again.<//review>

<Text>Crossfit Santa Monica is a great facility! We were traveling from abroad so just popped into one class. The session was very well run by the trainer Jackson and there was great atmosphere amongst the members who were all very welcoming. Would definitely stop by again when I'm next in town.<//Text><userid>108469862489993896407</userid><username>Agata Holc<//username>< Rating>

Got Ringworm! Me and my friend got ringworm after taking they’re kettlebell class. My friend invited me for a class. It was kettlebells. The workout was good, the instructor was friendly. It wasn’t great. But the next day me and my fried noticed weird red bumps. I called him told him about how they were in the exact place where the kettlebells were rubbing against during the workout. I refused to believe it, thought it was eczema or something but then went to the doc and he said it was ringworm and prescribed me antifungal cream. The bubbly red circles went away after using it so it was definitely ringworm. Please clean your equipment. That’s basic. Feel bad about having to do this but it’s my duty to warn people and inform the gym.<//Text>

Highly enjoyed being a member of CFSM. Great coaches, programming and good use of space and equipment.  I made significant gains in the 3 months of being a member. Sad to leave but I had to move, so need the most convenient location to make sure I get to the WOD.  Highly recommend CFSM.</Text>

Dropped in for a few WODs while I was in Santa Monica for work and vacation.  Once I figured out that the box was in a small street mall I was ready to go.  Great coaches, great workout partners, great programming.  Thank you and look forward to dropping in again next time I am in Santa Monica.</Text>

My husband and I dropped in and had a great workout!! Really kicked our butts. My only complaint, that was not a big deal the day that we went in because we only had a class of 8, is that the box is very small. There is not much rig space. Other than that, the space was nice, very well kept up, the coach was very welcoming and friendly, and the workout was challenging.</Review>

We dropped in on a visit to the city. The coaches are welcoming and excellent instructors. The move by move breakdown of a muscle-up taught me some new tactics. The group is hardworking and friendly. Lots friendly banter and then high-fives at the end.< /review>

I have been doing Crossfit for 2 years and have visited a number of boxes around the country.  This is one of the best. The trainers, former Navy Seals, are fantastic.  The instruction was top notch and highly motivating.  Importantly, everyone was so welcoming and friendly.  If you live in the area, sign up.  If you are visiting, this is the right place to drop in.  Finally, if you visit on the right day, you will get to do your workout on the amazing Santa Monica beach.  What could be better.<//Review>

I am relatively new to the Crossfit environment, and was visiting a friend in Santa Monica who is a member of this box. I was a little nervous, but felt completely comfortable after checking in. Adrian was a great coach, and helped me with my form on several exercises. It was a great experience, and I will definitely visit again the next time I'm in the area.< /Review>

<Review>Had the opportunity to drop into this box when I was in LA for Thanksgiving.  I really felt welcomed from the moment I stepped in the door.  Coaches were great, helpful and kind... but still pushed the workout when it needed to get done.  The classmates all were hard working folks pushing themselves.... they are "all in"....

I would go back to this place again and again.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

It was an easy location.  I'd recommend it to anyone in the area or visiting.<//Review><user>118005068157055956051</user><Date>1478624724590< /Date>< Pictures>

My husband and I dropped in at CrossFit Santa Monica during our recent trip to the west coast. We attended the "Kettle Bell Hell" class. We were welcomed by friendly staff and members. The coaches were very personable, but also took things very seriously (in my book - a good thing). I felt that they paid attention and were engaged with the class to ensure nobody hurt themselves, while at the same time teaching the proper form for everything we did. It was interesting to do things (like use 2 kettle bells at a time) that we don't normally do at our home CrossFit. We left thoroughly worked out and happy. I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a solid workout in a clean, well-equipped and friendly environment. If we are in the area again, we will definitely be back!</Text>

Truly might be the best CF gym I've ever been to.  Awesome space, free parking which is key in Santa Monica, kick ass coaches, clean clean clean facility (pet peeve of mine), and cool/welcoming members.  Can't wait to go back!  Andrew Jackson, WY<//Text>

I finally made it to CrossFit Santa Monica and it was awesome!

The coach and other regular members were super nice from the minute I walked in.
I drop in at different boxes all the time and I especially enjoyed the workout (Sat team), the people and the cleanliness at this box.

There were beginners and experienced crossfitters so it was a good mix.

I would definitely go back again...location is awesome and they have parking!!<//Review>

Highlight of my training in the USA while traveling for 3 weeks was no doubt Crossfit Santa Monica.  Great facility, attentive coaching and friendly team.  Enjoyed every session I managed to attend while in LA.  Highly recommended.</review>

I dropped into CF Santa Monica while visiting town for a few days.  The trainers were incredibly welcoming and despite the large classes while I was there, the trainers took as much time as if it were my home gym to help with form and modifications.   The workouts were challenging.....but doable.</text>

CrossFit Santa Monica offers their members, and even visitors, a superb, fun experience. Their staff is engaging and motivating. Most of all they'll let you have fun while working out. I would recommend CrossFit Santa Monica to anyone that lives in the area or is visiting the area.

Dropped in from Italy. The coach Jackson was super friendly. I’ve been doing crossfit for half a year, never done double under even if I tried. Jackson, after a few minutes of annoying attempt to do double under, stops me and give me and advice. The next try I did 10 and at the end of the lesson I did 20 in a row, AWESOME!<//text>

<Review>I did a drop-in at CrossFit Santa Monica loved it.  Aimee coached the class that day and was extremely knowledgeable and had great coaching cues.  Before class started I noticed she went over to a couple newbies and gave them some extra one-on-one time going over the day's movements. The WOD (workout of the day) was on the longer side and had several components and Aimee was very patient explaining it multiple times if anyone had questions.  She was also really welcoming and made sure everyone in the class had a chance to introduce themselves before we got started.  The other members in the class were friendly as well and several struck up conversation with me before and after the workout.  Next time I'm in town I'll definitely be back!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I decided to give CrossFit a try after being essentially inactive for almost a year due to injury. I’m 59 and was apprehensive about being fit enough- or young enough- to do CrossFit. I don’t know if all CrossFit boxes would have been as good for me as CF Santa Monica, but I have to say that Carter and Kaj and all of the people I’ve had the privilege to work out with over the past few months have made it an outstanding experience. Tough, yes, but I don’t feel like anyone is pushing me to the point where I am going to get hurt, only to the point where I am getting stronger and faster. Everyone is very supportive of honest effort and even modest achievement. And the box is great- excellent equipment, great location, and pool and beach workouts sprinkled in for some variety- can’t say enough good things!<//Review>< gmap_id>

I travel all over the US and I love to visit different boxes.  CFSM has a great vibe.  Very welcoming.  And a hard core WOD (at least the day I went).  Check out the website.  Truly unique class offerings.< /Text>

Crossfit Santa Monica is the perfect all levels workout. I had never done Crossfit before, but the instructor balanced the novices like me with the advanced participants and was a great motivator. Everyone was really supportive, the facilities and equipment are impressive and the class was fun! Excited to have this gym in the neighborhood!</review>

We emailed them to confirm we would join the team wod on Saturday morning at 9.00, but when we showed up, they decided to make us wait half hour and only then told us they would merge that class with the beach class at 9.30 (which not only is later, but obviously requires swimwear, which we didn’t have). Wasted our entire Saturday morning, and didn’t even apologise.< /review>

There was some miscommunication and we assumed that your inquiry about Beachfit meant you would be attending and not looking for a different class. You are welcome to come back on a class on us. Give us the opportunity to change your mind. To clarify swimwear is not required for Beachfit. It is recommended if you chose to participate in the swim portion but we have plenty of athletes each week who do not go in the water. We hope to make it up to you'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bad4bfd46d89:0x62c69725f8dff76<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>isiting LA from the east coast, I was looking for a morning workout that would keep me going for the rest of my day. CrossFit Santa Monica more than met my goal and the 35 minute WOD was amongst the most intense I have ever done. Class was led by Mike (though Carter supervised) and even as a drop in, one felt welcomed and part of the group. Highly recommend this gym and when next in LA I will go back.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I’m an avid athlete and have worked out across the U.S. This is seriously the best crossfit gyms in the nation in my opinion, as well as overall workout experiences I have ever been a part of. Let’s start with the staff, as that’s what really impressed me to begin with. On the first time that I dropped in, one of the staff members generously guided me on my form without hesitating – and in the process helped me avoid injury.  Next, the people you’re working out with – it was a very welcoming community, and one of the fellow students in the class came up to me afterwards to chat. Wow – what an awesome experience!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Dropped in for a month from London, UK.
Really friendly and super easy. If you've done Crossfit elsewhere you know exactly where you're at and what to expect. There were a lot of drop ins for whom it was a bit new but they were able to get stuck in straight away. And that's 90% of the battle in joining a new gym. Awesome Gym, great people, fantastic Cardio Twist to things for those who want it.
Joined for a month - wish I could stay longer<//text>

<Review>Me and to friends from Norway dropped in during games week. Coach Shane took good care of us. Being one new guy and 2 veterans of Crossfit, we all felt the workout and coaching was up to our standards. The box was just as home, small, clean and with not a to big class. The people we talked to was very friendly. If you are in the are, its really recommended to drop by for a wod.<//Review>< user>

BEST GYM EVER.  Top notch coaching staff who are patient, and attentive. If you are brand new to Crossfit or veteran crossfitter  this is the place to do it. The whole gym community is welcoming and fosters a nonjudgmental atmosphere for all ages and fitness levels. If you are in the area, this is the gym to go to, don't waste your workout time anywhere else.< /Text>

<text>Awesome Place!
I found this Studio by pure chance when I was in LA for vacation. I got there right the next day. I´ve never done Crossfit before but I always wanted to try it. This was just the right place! I loved the whole Workout. The coaches were awesome and did a great job! The other participants there motivated me and said like "good job, keep doing" although they didn´t know me. Everybody was very nice.
I just had so much fun and enjoyed the Workout. I went there 2 days later again.
If I´m ever in LA again I will definitely go there again! LOVED IT!< /text>< pictures>

When I heard that a new box had opened in my neighborhood, I was super psyched.  Then I heard it was run by Navy SEALs and I was, obviously, a lottle nervous.  But all my fears were alleviated after the first workout.  It was hard (it's CrossFit, duh), but there wasn't a brass bell hanging anywhere.  Nobody was washing out.  (That is the extent of my Navy SEAL lingo, so I'll move on.)

The coaches are great!  I've mostly worked with Coach Michael who is AWESOME, but the other coaches (Carter and Kaj) are fabulous as well.  My level of CrossFit has greatly improved since I started here.  They take the time to help with your form which is important for someone like me - over 40 and relatively new to the game.  I won't recover from an injury as quickly as the spring chickens, so I need to get it right.  BIG points for that!

And the place is clean and organized.  Maybe I'm the only person who really takes note when I see something like clean bathrooms, but they're so clean that I was taken aback.  ABACK!  Plus, towels for your sweaty, sweaty face.  It's glorious.< /text>

The rule of Crossfit that I like the most is "check your ego at the door". This box definitely has this attitude. I dropped in this box for 15.4, and Kaj immediately made me feel at home. I cannot judge the coaching because I only did the open wod, but if you're in town and looking for a box full of friendly people and a nice atmosphere, this is your stop!< /review>

<text>I´m from Brazil and started in Crossfit 6 months ago. I had a drop in class in SMCF and was a great experience. The box is fantastic and the coaches very welcoming. They gave us (both out of town and daily atheletes) the same attention. I really recommend. If you like Crossfit and come to Santa Monica, try hard to go training on this box.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Visited Crossfit Santa Monica during a recent vacation. Good variety of classes and amazing coaches. Although we were out of towners, we felt very welcome. Whether you've been doing Crossfit for years or just beginning, I'm certain you will be impressed. Thanks CFSM for a couple excellent workouts.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Crossfit Santa Monica is AMAZING. I have been doing crossfit for about a year now back on the east coast at school and I am out here for the summer with my sister. We were trying to find a good box to workout at and came across Crossfit Santa Monica. Throughout all of the spring, we were messaging back and forth to Carter, one of the owners, who could not have been more welcoming and excited for our arrival.  Not only is all the equipment new and top of the line but facility is beyond my expectation. The showers are amazing with shampoo/conditioner, fresh towels, new razors and clean space...something that I do not take for granted when I have to get ready for work after a 6:30 am workout.

The coaches are awesome and supportive! We always go through the workout before hand with the movements so that everyone knows what they're doing and so no one gets hurt. Even as an experienced crossfitter, it's always good to go over the movements. And during the workout everyone goes at their own pace and scale the workout to their level. They push you to work hard and do your best. The other owner, Kaj, is a bundle of joy and the nicest guy ever. Always making everyone laugh and have a good time to forget about how hard a workout might be. Overall, such a great box with great amenities, free parking, and awesome people!< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Two words: Results and Programming. Crossfit Santa Monica is the second box I have been a member at. I can honestly say the results I have achieved based on the programming at the box is what makes this place a 5 rating. In a short 2 and a half months I have dramatically increased my PR in pull ups (strict and kipping), handstand push ups, ring dips, double unders , muscle ups, toes to bar, front squat, back squat etc....

The results are the most important thing to me however, other benefits include, excellent location, great coaches, beach WODs (Fourth of July was awesome) and open gym.  CFSM also posts their WODs the night before (this was key to my wife and I joining) and uses wodtogether to track the results which is also cool.</text>< Pics>

<Text>After my husband and I moved to Santa Monica, one of our first to-do items was to find our new crossfit box.  Having just moved from the east coast, we were anxious to find a box where we would fit in and could get a great work out.  I'm happy to say that Crossfit Santa Monica has more than met those expectations.

First comes first--location.  You can't beat the prime real estate on Main St. just minutes from the beach where WODs are often held, which is just a huge bonus.  Next, the programming is spot on.  There is a nice mix between killer burners and short AMRAPS, plus they focus on skill work, like toes-to-bar and double unders, which I've found that many other gyms often overlook.  Finally and most importantly, the coaches are really great in many ways.  They teach the technique of all the movements very well and you can tell they generally care about helping ALL the athletes, not just the elite competitors.

All in all, Crossfit Santa Monica is a fantastic box that has made our move to a new city that much easier.  Now that we have a box as good as CFSM, we are happy to call Santa Monica home.<//Text></record>

Nothing but awesome experiences with Crossfit Santa Monica. Carter, Kaj and their team of amazing coaches do a great job motivating and programming the perfect blend of strength and endurance training. Between the SEAL coaches and the perfect beach location, the Crossfit Santa Monica athletes are constantly learning to run, lift, and swim.

I look forward to everyday that I train with each group.  Sundays with Alex Stowall kicks my @ss.  Tues/Thursday is beach WODs.  Wednesday night is the best Track and Swim endurance classes.

All classes have just he right amount of people in them.  It is never too busy to just grab a class.  Classes are also super friendly to both members and drop-ins alike. Great people, great aura, great place to train.<//text>

I first visited CrossFit Santa Monica in late-March and have been hooked ever since.

Let's face it, CrossFit looks intimidating. Ripped men and women, heavy weights, quick times and all that WOD lingo... It can be overwhelming for a newbie. CFSM made me feel right at home. I almost puked after my first workout, but undeterred I kept at it, and am glad I did.

The instructors are knowledgable, members are friendly and the location is prime time. If you're lucky, you'll even get a beach workout. What I like most about CFSM is the atmosphere. Other boxes overemphasize time and weight, which IMO is a total deterrent. Let's face it, I'm at CFSM for a good workout and some motivation. I'm not trying to compete, and there's no way I'm going to hang clean 110 pounds. The encouragement I get from staff and members pushes me to try harder and lift more. Members stay until everyone completes the WOD. CFSM's camaraderie is awesome.

After a few months at CFSM I feel stronger and look leaner, but I'm not the only one who notices. Between pool parties and beach days, I've received countless comments on my physique and what I do to stay fit. I'm like, "Oh, CrossFit Santa Monica, they're the best." For reals though, I haven't felt this good about my body since competitive dance team days almost ten years ago.

If you're looking to give CrossFit a try, look no further than this box. It blows the competition out of the Pacific.< /Text>

This place is AMAZING! They have a variety of great classes - Crossfit, Team Crossfit, SMX, Kettlebell Hell, Watermen (in the pool or ocean - great workout!), and B3 (bells, boxing, and bodyweight - my new favorite!).  Since I joined about 3 months ago, I've gotten so much stronger! I'm more confident in myself and in my body - especially since I just spent 6 days in a bikini on the beach in Cozumel!

Whether you're an experienced crossfitter or you're just starting out, this is a great place to be! The coaches are knowledgeable, experienced, motivating, and supportive, and the athletes really encourage each other. Your first class is free, so come check it out!!!  You won't regret it!</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very dirty are the showers and the lobby and everything around the pool
Years ago I went and was not like this
Pay one so they don't clean, if I could I would give it zero stars

<Rating>3</Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Fun for children, the bad thing is that only there is a single pool and children, boys and adults are in the same little piece and when they dive they can hit those who are down in the water when more people arrive it is better to go out because they do not fit

(Original)
Divertido para los niños lo malo es q sólo ahí una sola piscina y los niños,chicos y grandes están en un mismo pedasito y cuando se hecha clavados pueden pegarle a los q están abajo en el agua cuando llega más gente es mejor salir por q ya no caben< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

< Review>
Encore academy is a fanatastic school ! I am new to the world of aviation and have always wanted to fly. Before coming to Encore, I wasn’t exactly sure if this was something I wanted to do for fun or for my career. I booked a  consultation with the lovely girl in the friend desk who was super helpful and attentive and helped get me an appointment right away. I met with Alex and he was very thorough with all the different packages they offer and patient with all my questions! I started my training here and I absolutely love it! The staff here makes you feel like family and the instructors are all so professional. I honestly feel like out of all the other schools I looked into, Encore was hands down the most versatile and professional around. I definitely made the right decision by coming here. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone who wants to get any of their ratings. They offer career packages as well for those who want to become a pilot for airline. Thank you encore for making this experience an incredible one so far!<//Review>

I am current student at Encore, I started flying here about a six months ago. I signed up the complete package they offer, I am going to get my Private Pilot, Instrument and Multi engine ratings. The training has been a lot fun so far, I tried all their aircraft and I decided on the Diamond.

The main advantage for me has been the ability to cross train between flight simulators and the aircraft. With all their simulators, I usually practice the maneuvers in the sims before I get to try them in the real aircraft. This has been great advantage,  when I get to the aircraft I exactly know that is expected of me.

My instructor has been also amazing, he is very knowledgeable and patient.

Overall excellent customer service, and great airplane.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzUicClU4_N49D0qoQND1cDrFN5-JPME_BrE8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsdIFpO2uXTQTr1A5lpYm-B6nQ-0g7eIUkers=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd3u7d_qME0UEn0ZfXrLuPdcM1gQMRHWLLqTM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Review>I just visited LA a little while back and went to Encore Flight Academy for a demo flight. My flight instructor was very knowledgeable  and friendly, he even spent some extra time with us explaining the whole process. Also the Aircraft was very nice, and well equipped. Overall he made us feel very safe and comfortable. We will definitely go back.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have been a student here at Encore Flight for two months now, the training has been amazing. I am flying the Piper Warriors, they have 10 of them in the fleet, I also did a few flights in their Cessna’s. The best part of my flight training so far has been in the flight simulators, they have full motion simulators (4 of them) that are very realistic, we have been trying all the maneuvers in the simulators first before flying, which help me a lot. Overall I highly recommend them.</review>

As an engineer, I am very skeptical of safety issues and am generally very risk averse. So before I signed up for my flight training, I did a thorough research of different flight schools in the area.  Encore Flight was the best I could find in the area, from friendly front desk, to having many aircraft that would allow you to fly anytime you want and with different types of aircraft, to very skillful instructors.  They actually have their maintenance on site, and I have visited the facility and spoken with the mechanics there.  They don't hide anything because they do everything to the highest quality.  I signed up for my private pilot package, and I couldn't be more satisfied.</text>

Great flight school, I have been going to this school for a while now the service is absolutely amazing. I recommend a few of my friends here too.

They are great a great training program using motion flight simulators and great airplanes combined.

Also they are the largest flight school around, that meant better availability and pricing.

Go see Sheryl, she is the best.<//Review>

Excellent flight school, I saw some of the negative reviews here and I thought i should share my experience with Encore flight. I personally got to know the owner of the school, he is very knowledgeable about aviation and as former airline pilot, he is very experienced in running an aviation program.

The aircraft an Encore Flight are absolutely the best, there are more than 20 aircraft on the fleet, more than any other flight school around. Also great flight simulators, the operate 4 full motion Redbird flight simulators.< /Text>

<text>Hello all,
I wanted to take a few moment and wrote about my experience with encore flight.

Me and my boyfriend are both encore students, we did a lot of research and comparison between flight schools before choosing them. We stared flying about a year ago. I called and visited a lot of flight schools initially. My biggest concern was finding he right equipment (airplane and flight simulator). Other schools i visited either didn't have any flight simulators or good airplanes. Encore has about 20 airplanes(some older and some new ones) based on
our experience they are in a very good shape. I have been flying in their Diamonds and my boyfriend is flying the Cirrus. Also they have redbird flight simulators. They  are full motion and great for learning the procedures and checklists.
We singed for their package and their pricing was better that all the other schools we checked.
Also I really like my flight instructor (Alex).

Overall a great experience, I am taking my check ride this week. I will definitely sing up for instrument rating next.

Thanks encore!</text><GmapID>0x80c29a104d1f5207:0x1223a916da681ffe<//GmapID><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

Before giving these people your money, do a search and read the news articles. Their planes are trash and I would not trust anyone I know and love to either rent or learn to fly in them. There are safer, cheaper, and more logical options than Encore. I did not feel welcome in their office and the owner who I met, did not seem trustworthy. Meet him yourself if you like, but I really suggest taking your business elsewhere. Their aggressive marketing strategy makes them seem successful and the only option in the area, but trust me, they're not.</Text>

Great flight school to that utilizes many different techniques to teach individuals the fine arts of learning to handle a plane. I signed up a while back and my contract included training which taught me the bare essentials as well as flight necessities which I know will help me out. The memorable experiences I had here were definitely exceptional and to be remembered for years to come. Overall great academy.</Review>

They have an amazing flight simulator center with 6 FAA approved flight simulators. Go see Alex for tour.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Hello all,

I wanted to take a second and write about my experience with Encore Flight.
I started my training with them about a year ago. I have been flying in the their Cirrus, and i also fly with Flight Simulators. The overall experience has been great.

I signed up for my course with Alex initially, he is one of the managers there. He explained how the program works and went over all the details. So far everything has been as he covered at the beginning.< /Review>

Usually people write long reviews to share their experience with others. Unfortunately I'm not one of thoese people who writes pages In fact I don't like to write unless I'm super impressed and I must tell you this is one of those cases that I was beyond surprised with their service, staff and equipment. (A BIG THANKS TO ALL OF YOU) to the front desk with great attitude, to my instructor that patiently tolerated me and last but not least the big boss who helped me with my finance and payments.
You guys are awesome! ENCORE FLIGHT ROCKS</review>

This is an amazing flight school. I did a ton of research before signing up here. The customer service is superb. They always have available aircraft and flight simulators, that's one of the advantages of having the largest  fleet of aircraft in Van Nuys.

I have been flying in the Diamond and Cirrus aircraft. They are all newer model airplanes. My flight instructor is awesome, very knowledgeable and experienced.

I learned a lot, in the flight simulators as well.

They are open 7 days a week. Special thanks to front desk ladies as well.<//Text>

<Text>Encore Flight school has been the best since day 1. They have treated me with respect since the day I first came into the school and helped me prepare for my future. The instructors here are great. I recommend Ashish Patil as an instructor he is prepared for any zero hour students to commercial or CFI. There are a bunch of planes available which is great when it comes to flying there are no delays or issues with scheduling. Shirley is the best when it comes to the front desk, she is always ready to help you out. Alex the owner is also great. He welcomes you and shows you around the school. He is available for whatever you may need. I recommend Encore Flight School!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great flight school! I have looked at a few other schools and am happy I decided to get my private certificate at Encore.

They have plenty of pa 28 Cherokee planes available so there is always one available.

The instructors are not overbooked and available. They also seem to care more about their students than making extra money on the clock. I had Hayden and he made sure that I was ready to pass my check ride.

The weather at Van Nuys is great for VFR flying. I flew out of Santa Monica and always had to re schedule due to weather.

Learning at Van Nuys teaches you to be comfortable in the congested LA airspace.

The staff at Encore is great. Mike takes great care of the planes and answers all of my questions, and trust me I ask a lot. Seth and Shirley at the front desk are awesome! Shirley made a special effort to take care of me when my check ride was approaching and made sure I had the plane that I wanted and it was in good condition for my test day.

Great school and even after getting my private license I continue to fly with them.< /Review>< Date>

<review>Brief background about myself. I am currently a full time pharmacy school student at USC and I have a part time job. I recently turned 25 and I have two years left in my pharmD program. I decided that I wanted to get a private pilot license as a hobby. The idea of flying is just so cool and it is a very unique skill to have. For anyone out there who is interested in getting their private pilot license hopefully you will find this review to be helpful for you. I will provide an overview of my experience in getting my private pilot license at Encore and what I liked and what I would have done differently if I had to get my license all over again.

First and foremost, Encore is a legit flying school. From what I can tell, the majority of Encore's instructors are nice people and have very useful information when it comes to instructing students and helping students become competent and comfortable to fly. They have plenty of planes to fly with and there was never really an issue when scheduling planes for my flying lesson. If one plane was under scheduled maintenance there was always another plane that my instructor and I could take up instead. Encore always has certified airplane mechanics on staff to make sure the planes are safe and compliant under regulation. Shirley, who works at the front and handles literally everything is beyond competent. Alex is the owner of Encore and he is a nice guy. If I had to get my license again I would still go with encore, but here are some things I noticed and here is what I would have done differently.

I personally underestimated this process. I thought that because I am an athletic guy and I got into a doctorate program so I should be able to get good at flying really quick. That wasn't quite the case. I passed my private pilot checkride (test) around the 70 hour mark. I passed first try but it definitely took longer than I had intended. There are definitely people that can finish sooner than 70 hours but just keep in mind that you may have to spend over 40 hours (the minimum legal amount) to become competent at flying the plane safely.

This brings me to my next point, if you are about to start flying, I would recommend finishing the whole process in one sitting. Be able to dedicate a few months to studying and flying and try not to take an extended hiatus. I had to take about 6 months off of flying due to school and as a result I had to relearn some things to become proficient for the checkride again so I ended up having to take more lessons and essentially pay more money. FINISH IN ONE SITTING. Don't fly for one month and take another month off and then come back to flying. It will save you a lot of money in the long run to have consistency in your training. Be super proactive about your training. You have to want it for yourself.

Finally, you may end up spending more money than you initially intended to. You may need over 40 hours to become comfortable enough with flying a plane. Buying extra study materials cost money. Decent flying headsets can cost 300 and up. The final checkride costs about $800. Insurance will cost a couple hundred dollars. Essentially, whatever you think flying is going to cost, add a couple thousand or more to that amount. Flying is an expensive hobby, there's no doubt about that. But it can also be a lucrative career if you are trying to fly for a commercial company.

I am beyond glad I got my private pilot license. I am not exaggerating when I say that it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Since I got my license, I have flown my girlfriend over Malibu. It was just such a sick experience to be able to fly passengers myself. I would encourage everyone to fly. If you want to become a pilot, Encore will take you to where you need to be.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_id>

Stay away from this company!  I'm a military pilot that went to the company to receive training in the Piper Seminole for an ATP license.  They delivered a mechanically defective plane without proper documentation of maintenance records.  I cancelled the service without receiving any training from the company and I've been trying to get my $2000 refunded for 2 weeks.  The company is a bunch of crooks.  I later discovered from talking to other military pilots, an FAA examiner and another flight school in the area that they have a terrible reputation.  Do not give these people your money!  I'm going to see a lawyer next week.</text>

I do not recommend Encore Flight Academy for flight training.
On Sept 13, 2017, I put down a $5000 block payment for flight instruction for a multi-engine add-on.  I have a commercial instrument rating.  Encore's requirement was that any balance left in the account would be refunded back to me if and when I completed the training with them (i.e. passed the check ride).  My requirement was that Encore would provide me as much flight instruction by Sept 28, when I was permanently moving from Los Angeles to the Bay Area.  Alex A. the owner and I agreed to those terms.  His words were "we can do our part; it's all up to you"

At my behest, Alex C, my assigned instructor sat down with me to create a training plan and to schedule a weeks worth of flights on the calendar.  Unfortunately, all of the scheduled flights were canceled the day of or the day prior.  The first was due to ceilings being too low, the second due to a plane missing in the hands of the mechanic who was supposed to have it ready by my schedule flight, and the remainder due to pop-up checkrides for other trainees.  In the end, I was not able to log any flight time.

I asked my instructor Alex C. if it would be reasonable to ask for a refund as I had done my best to proactively schedule as many flights as possible.  He instructed me to talk to the owner, Alex A. in-person the very next day.  Unfortunately, the admin called me the very next morning to cancel my appointment with Alex A. because of a pop up emergency.  When I asked to reschedule, she insisted I call him instead.  I was able to reach him by phone  on my first try.  On this call, I politely requested he consider the possibility of a refund and that he would be in the right to exclude from the refund whatever service charges he might have incurred on those transactions.  He said he would look into it and call me back in 2 days.  Unfortunately, I have not heard back from him since, and my repeated calls to his admin at the office and his cell now go unanswered.  I have asked my instructor Alex C. help in getting a hold of Alex A., but this is to no avail either, as he is slow to respond and claims he has not been able to do so either.  I have strong reasons to believe their avoidance is deliberate, considering that for my very first visit, I was able to schedule an in-person visit with Alex A. with an impromptu phone call a mere 30 minutes in advance.

I don't recommend Encore because of their avoidance of customers who no longer present a revenue opportunity for them, and for their lack of values and ethics.

As of now, I have $5000 in an account with them that I am not able to use nor reclaim.<//Text>

<review>I had 2 flight experience with their piper N310EF, first flight we taxied to the gas station which they were out of fuel so we taxi back to encore , I paid 1.0 for aircraft and instructor for doing nothing!!  I was charged $328 at that day.
Second flight experience was even worst!, we taxied to the gas station and luckily they had fuel this time so we spent about 0.5 for refueling. then we took off and flew over Simi valley doing couple of maneuver like power off stall, while recovering from power off stall when I added full power the engine started choking, So the instructor rush back to VNY .we had kind of emergency landing, So scary!!!. I am glad we made it back and I am alive!!
At that day my invoice was $433 which I had a chance of flying maybe 0.2
I hope the management see this review and do something about the issues at their flight school and refund me some of what I paid them.
Safety-wise and financially I do not recommend them.
I believe students shouldn't be charged for refueling which is school responsibility.</review>< Response>

Like the previous reviewers, I want to warn other potential students / renters about this place. I went there about 2 years ago, to rent a Piper PA-28 for a few days.

The planes looked great on the pictures, the owner was also very friendly on the phone. When I arrived, it however turned out that their fleet is only in marginal condition, with many of their planes grounded. Personally, I could not fly on multiple occasions, due to various technical issues like a failed transponder. During the run-up for the checkout with one of their flight instructors, I learned that elevator was stuck, I had to use quite some force to overpower it. As a side note: This was the second plane we used, after they couldn’t find the key for the one they originally wanted to use. Great.
I was originally planning to make a longer cross country flight every day, but ended up with only one single cross country flight and a few shorter flights, mainly due to technical issues. On top of that, the management was pretty unorganized. Even though I always showed up as scheduled and on time, they always struggled to find a functioning plane. The most frustrating experience was however, when the keys for the plane were supposed to be dropped of at the FBO on the last day of my stay, which was a holiday, so that I could go flying and use up my deposit. Almost as expected, they forgot to drop of the keys. When I tried to call the owner and one of his employees on their mobile phones, neither would pick up return my call.

At the end, I still hadn't used up my deposit, due to the issues with this company. Needless to say, that I was really disappointed that my exciting flying vacation turned out to be a complete failure.

Gladly, the owner promised to return the remaining $200 or so Dollars - what he however never did, despite of me calling them multiple times and sending a number of e-mails.

Confirming a previous reviewers statement, I personally also know a DPE who refuses to work with them anymore, mainly due to the condition of their aircraft.

Overall, one of the most frustrating and disappointing experiences I ever had with a company.< /text>

As one of the local examiners that refuses to do check rides for Encore students put it, “Encore is a disgrace to the aviation community”. This pretty much sums them up. They have a terrible reputation at Van Nuys airport and is the worst flight school in the area. Their airplanes are junk, poorly maintained, and unsafe.  If you are considering this scam of a school, do your due diligence. The president is a professional liar that has only one motive, to rip-off the student in any way possible.  He has had his pilot license and teaching certificate revoked because of his illegal activities.< /text>

<user>118418112077492604786< /user><text>Great operation. I saw a few negative reviews here that i believe might not be fair and/or accurate. So i though I should share me experience.
I initially started my flight trainig about 4 years ago, back then I met with Alex, he was one of the flight instructors. He explained all the benefits and hours requirements to get a private pilot license. I got the full private pilot package. My trainig took about 4 month to complete. I did most of my flight time in their Diamond airplanes, they have 3 of them. Maintenance was really good, and the aitplanes are in a really nice shape(you can go check them out any time, they will give you a tour). I also did a few hour in the flight simulators, it was a usefull experience.
And since then I have been renting airplanes from them for my personal use, I put my family in their aircraft for long ans short trips, my favorite these days in the Cirrus. Great airctaft.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

<gmap_id>0x80c29a104d1f5207:0x1223a916da681ffe< /gmap_id><review>I wanted to make sure to write a review on Encore Aviation/Encore Flight academy to warn other prospective students about this scam of a flight school so they wouldn't have to go through the same headaches and massive troubles I went through. I put 2,000 dollars down for flight training to receive a multi engine instructor certificate (I'm already a CFI and CFII) and this was one of the few schools in the area that had a piper seminole I could find to do training. The person who owns the school was eager enough to take my money and made all kinds of promises about how they would work around my schedule and be able to get me done in a few weeks. Due to lack of instructors and an incredibly shoddy aircraft (so shoddy most DPE's refuse to administer checkrides) there were several delays. After not meeting my timeframe I still had over $800 dollars on my account and asked for it to be refunded. One of the women at the front desk said that the agreement I signed said the money was non-refundable (even though I signed no such document and even asked this upfront before putting a deposit down.) I finally got a hold of Mr. Abassi and spoke in person with him and he assured me the money would be returned. After months and months of waiting and dodging my phone calls and emails the money was never returned and in the end I had to go through my credit card company to get the funds returned.

I was just surprised at the flat out lies and deceit by a flight school and found it completely unproffesional.
Having worked at a number of flight schools I never even dreamed about someone trying to just keep $800 dollars of someone else's hard earned money that wasn't spent and was just sitting in an account. These people who manage this company worry about nothing but getting money out of you and if you're considering flight training you should have someone who looks out for your training and your best interests not just someone who wants to rake you over the coals for cash. As a student though make sure to do your due diligence. If you're seriously considering flight training check out a number of other flight schools and ask them on their return policies though. I found corsair aviation at vanuys a much much better school with much better aircraft to train on. There are many alternatives to going through places that will rip you off like this though.</review><user_id>100562296154225449785< /user_id><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

< Review>
Very bad school. They tell many lies to get your money. This is not a school for a serious pilot. The simulators are ok but the airplanes are terrible and always broken along with very low level instruction.<//Review>

This is strictly based on the phone experience. I tried to call and place my order for pickup. The phone never gets answered. I've tried calling over 10 times. On multiple occasions. I am willing to change my review if this ever gets solved.< /Text>

<text>I got the burrito plate...it came with a choice of meat, beans, pico, sour cream & guacamole in the burrito with red sauce on top & rice on the side! I got roast beef & no sour cream...sauce was a little spicy but still good & rice was good! You order at counter & they bring it to you when ready! The guy was pretty nice & the place is nice inside! Food was good...little pricey...but would still recommend!<//text>< UserId.>

I've been there dozens of times over the last 3 years and have never had a bad meal, or bad experience. The store is immaculately clean, staff is friendly, food comes quickly, and every meal tastes great. The burrito bowls are spectacular, and the West coast Burrito is delicious. It's the kind of place locals should support - 10 times better than any chain restaurant, and top quality. I love this place :) Parking is a pain - there are rarely spots in front of the store - head toward Del Taco and Denny's where there are plenty of spots.</Review>< pictures>

Ordered fajitas here and they were outstanding! Nice size portion they didn't skimp on meat and give you lots of veggies like most places do.They surprised us by bring over deep fried ice cream since it was Mother's Day. That was a very nice surprise.Everyone seems very nice and the place is clean. We will be back next time we are in the area and my parents said they will be back soon.<//Text>

Worst place ever. They think they are a high quality Mexican food place but it's just over priced albertos. We spent 42 buck for small portion combo plates with barely any carne asada on the tacos. I'll drive to corona for real albertos next time.<//text>

< review>
Called in a phone order, they said it would be ready at 7:30. I got there a few minutes early and found out they never made the order. I waited 20 minutes for my food.

The lady at the counter did not care at all and took no responsibility and said the cooks made the decision to not make my food because they had "other orders".

I laughed and told her "you're doing it all wrong".....<//review>

<Review>Great flavor without the excessive grease I find at other places (I've ordered nachos, fries, west coast burrito, chorizo burrito, chili Verde burrito, carne asada burrito so far). Great service, I came in 15 minutes before closing and nothing but smiles. This is my go to spot now, love it.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This place just blows my mind, food is great authentic more like straight home made granny type stuff, tortas, sopes, burritos, tacos menudo chilachilles, tacos de papa all is really great need to check this place out. The salsa the they give you with chips has a kick already, then with your food they ask you want something hot damn hot as but cant stop eating good stuff< /Review>

Somewhat upscale location good food though at good prices. If you like rice in your burrito ask though as their prep is just meat beans and Pico de gallo<//Text>

<Review>i stopped by for a quick to-go order of their asada west coast burrito! i stopped by on a thursday afternoon around 12pm, and was in & out within 5-9 minutes. this is their version of the typical california burrito (the one with fries and without beans). they have self serve salsa and came with the lids for customers on the go. i usually find an issue with overly greasy burritos whenever i order this type of burrito, but this one was just right! the size of the burrito is just right, and didn't make me food coma full. i've also always been a HUGE fan of mexican food so this satisfied my cravings! i'll be back!!<//Review>< pictures>

Food is good. Prices are reasonable. What I don't like is the menu layout,  does not really appeal to the eye which gives you a hard time wanting to order anything.< /Text>

<Review>1st time visiting. Food was great staff was great! We got a sausage breakfast burrito, one of their signature burritos with carne asada, shredded beef tacos beans and rice. The meat was clean and flavorful. The salsa for chips and salsa was really good and the bar salsa's were really good as well. Everything came out hot and fresh. Definitely NOT something that they pulled from a freezer that was previously made. Only downfall was both bathrooms suck. Just for a regular #1 visit the toilet paper doesn't go down. Both men's and women's are the same. My brother-in-law even took the top off of the bowl to see if the chain had come off and it hadn't. The water keeps running and there's no power to the flesh.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Last night the Asada Grill catered my class reunion.  They served cheese enchiladas, rice & beans, salsa & chips, and Horchata to drink.  Everything was set up for us.  The food was superb!  Could not have been happier!  I highly recommend them for your next event.<//text>

<text>Friendly service and the place is kept very clean. I had the Asada Plate, it comes with Asada, rice and beans, arvocato, Pico de Gallo, veges, and tortilla. It taste good, but the Asada was disappointing, it  is chewy and has tendons that wasn't trimmed off. Price is average.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>We were on our way to Del Taco, next door. I  saw this place, and was like, let's get real Mexican food.  It looked pretty good when we walked in. I noticed there were ONLY Hispanic folks inside, eating. I find this a good sign. Lol. (Only because  all my Hispanic friends talk about how most Mexican restaurants aren't authenic, and won't go to them).

So, it was super clean inside. The staff was extremely nice! The cashier smiled, and was friendly, and even said, oh that soda is so good! (We bought a couple bottles of appple soda)

First up, I ordered the 2 beef tacos platter, which comes with beans and rice. The tacos were really good! Very crunchy. A bit skimpy on the meat. But everything tasted fresh. Lots of flavor.

I don't usually like Mexican rice, but this was really good! It was moist, and flavorful. I liked it a lot. However, my hubby didn't care for it. He thought it was bland. We both liked the beans a lot. Very tasty.

Hubby got the fajitas, without peppers. He doesn't like spicey, and they had chili flakes, and were somewhat spicey. I like spicey, so we traded. They were super good! The chicken was tender, and had a lot of flavor. The more you ate, the spicier it got. But I liked them.

We got the chips and guacamole. The chips were good. But it's not the traditional, light and fluffy ones known at Mexican restaurants. They were like you do at home. Cut up a few corn tortillas, and fry them in oil. They were a bit hard. And the guacamole was good. But nothing special.

They have a couple of TVs around. With ball games on. They have a soda fountain, and another one with Orange bang, or horchata. Or you can buy a soda in a bottle. We got Apple. Pretty good.

I liked it, but my hubby didn't. I would like to try one if the bowls. So I may go for lunch alone. Lol<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I was looking for a more dependable groomer and came across this place. I am so blessed to have found them. My little dog "Syerra" has anxiety so bad but she was very calm here. Tami really must have a tender touch 😁</text>

this was the first time we took our 10 year old dog to tamis..our dog came home with blood coming out of his ears and we had to take him to the vet..we were told they plucked his hair in his ears which our dog has never had done at our regular groomer..the person who did this did not know what they were doing  we would never go back and hope you reconsider taking your dog there</text>

<text>Definitely the best groomer that we've found in the La Mesa area for both of our dogs and cats, we're always very happy with their service and prices. Our dogs both go in for full grooming and we bring our cats in when we pick up the dogs to get their nails trimmed. Been coming here for years!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Worse people ever! Never will take any animal to them again. They injured my dog then has the nerve to scream and yell over the phone at my wife. They don't want to ssume any responsibility what so ever and based on this incident they closed there doors early that day . They refuse to resolve the issue of a $500 vet bill after they injured my dog. Trust me there will be a law suit!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My visit to Rue 21 today was exceptional the cashier and the manager we're extremely helpful I shop at rue21 cuz I have a younger daughter there a little expensive but they have really cool clothes I could not find my receipt and that I was at a loss at almost $300 they were so nice to me to let me exchange things for my size and my friend and I even spent more money of course I always spend four to $500 when I go in there I just want to say a special thank you to them they were so very kind to me and  didnt make me feel less or then I've been in shops  spending a lot of money and they're so snobby I don't want to go back acting so  stuck up but these guys treated me so very special and kind so very helpful and  treating me very well I will definitely go to the store anytime I need clothes for my daughter</Review>

<Text>The employees were very attentive but the prices were very confusing. In the end it worked out in my favor but had the prices and signs been clear, I definitely would've been able to shop differently. Also, you can tell a lot of the clothes/materials were cheap.< /Text><name>Connie M.</name><rate>4< /rate></record></dataset><record>

They finally honored a price tag that they said was mismarked. That was a fair ending to a twenty minute disagreement  between myself and about 7 employees. It was all over a $4.00 price difference.< /text>

<review>Well, lost a regular because the cook is an idiot and all stingy on the meat portions, like if he owned the business. Wish i would have remembered to take a picture of my plate for this review. The place is usually empty or with very few people,  when it should be rush hour (after work). I always have to keep on paying for extra meat just to get the equivalence of one portion, which is what you see as a normal portion in any other Mexican restaurant. The waiters are cool, attentive and easy going but had to informed me that from now on i would get charged an extra $5, on top my "second" portion, I was supposedly being served because the cook told them to. The food quality is average so a 3 stars rating is fair.. ..So long gay boy and good bye Felicia to this place lol< /review>< Pics>

First visit. Service was great - friendly and efficient. The horchata was delicious. Had the chile verde plate, which was a bit spicier than I prefer. Definitely will go back and try another selection.<//Review>

I had some plumbers installing a kitchen faucet at my place, and the job was going long.  I decided to get coffee for the group, and went to the Starbucks in the store. Because I didn't know how they took their coffee, I asked for sugar packets.

Barista Jenny looked under the counter and said, "oh, we only have Splenda or Stevie right now. Otherwise, there's a guy on break and you'll have to wait.  As a matter of hospitality. I needed the sugar and told her it was not optional. She served about four or five people behind me, and after I complained that I would need my five drinks refunded if I wasn't provided sugar, Jenny relented and sent the assistant to get their supplies somewhere out in the store, which still took another five minutes.

When I finally got back, the plumbers were gone.  This trip was a total fail by Jenny and the Starbucks in Ralph's.  I am copying this comment and emailing it to corporate Starbucks. What I should do is bring the coffee I can't do anything with back for a refund.<//text>

<text>This location is very close to my family. I have to say that the times I have gone to this location, staff seem short and rude with customers. They are definitely understaffed. Such a high volume of customers and not enough staff. It isn't pleasant to visit this location. Too bad because that it makes good ambiance.<//text><Rating>3</Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><user>107071414321880548935</user>< Name>

There wasnt much of a variety. Nothing to put on the salad but croutons, bacon bits, and cheese. Maybe once things are fully open the food quality will increase.</review>

<Text>I genuinely hope this place has no bad reviews because the staff is SO friendly and for the price you're paying I honestly don't know how they stay in business! The food is great, I've never been let down. Usually when I go to a buffet at least one item has to be "off" or overcooked, but it's never happened to me here and we love coming here.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY8KLLc8dKAIwn1cVtxWpLiTyxYbwN1Y_XZJCj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmKEdyXf_lUyc95ckTdj_9Qew12SUMrmyYOSZB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

They don't really have crab like the web page says. When asked, they looked around, shrugged and said no.</text>

<review>My family and I always go here to get some good Chinese food, but tonight we were taken advantage of. We came in at 7 o'clock and their closing time said it was 9 o'clock. We came in expecting good food, but the food was cold and thinking they could make a quick buck, they served us the cold food instead of saying they were closed. To be exact, they were charging 77 dollars for cold, stale food for a family of 6. When complaining they said they would take off 10% for horrible quality and service. Will not be coming anytime soon for this mistreatment. Would give no stars, but it is not an option. Spend your hard earned money at a proper eating establishment.<//review>< Pictures>

One of sauces had a hair in it. I watched both the servers walk past it several times one of those times they stopped to replace a sauce next to that one and still didn't change it. Honestly not worth your money. The food was terrible no wonder there was only like 5 people there at 6 pm. Will not return.< /review><Rating>1< /Rating>< Date>

Decent food and a different variety of foods. Some times the tile in the buffet line feels very sleek as if you may slip. And also there's a red light in the air vent directly above the men's room toilet. As if an electrical device is up there.</Text>

This place use to be the best All You Can Eat Chinese place around but now it's the worst place around. The food was luke warm, they weren't putting out enough food, the spicky chicken tasted off & wasn't spicy at all it had more of a bbq flavor. No one refilled our drinks while we were there, even after asking two different people 3 times. The price went up & now your forced to pay the tip they want, instead of being able to leave what you want .</text>

< Review>
Worse place ever, food is old and disgusting, looks like they cook once a day and leave it there all day everything tasted as if it had no flavor, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to eat there. After I left I felt as if I was going to get food poisoning. I read the reviews so I could make sure I would eat there the reviews are lies it’s the worse place to eat it should be shut down. The deserts are disgusting I felt bad for my husband who has a good heart and paid even though I felt as if I we shouldn’t since we didn’t even make a dent in their disgusting food. I’m trying to warn people about this place it’s unsanitary</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>If you see people still eating don’t brimg out the bill, we were there for lunch and 30 min later they bring us our bill which we put our cash on top and they started bringing out crab legs and the kids wanted some, so we come back to our table and the bill is gone but the money is still there, we see from the kitchen the Chinese lady writing, so my mother in law approaches her and asks her what’s going on? Why did she take the bill but not the money?, she said they had to charge us more since it’s now dinner not lunch, we’ve only been in the restaurant for no more than 45min, so we tell her that this is wrong that the employee shouldn’t have brought out the bill if we were still eating, so they left it how it is but the waitress or whatever she was, would stare with a mean look on her face, bottom line is they tried to get more money out of us for their mistake, just be aware of the miscommunication from this establishment and unprofessional workers< /Text>< Pics>

We went in at 7:30pm on a Sunday and just like another reviewer stated, the food was all cold. We took a few bites of our first plate and just couldn't keep eating this tasteless cold food. We talked to the owner and she pointed to the steam coming out of the buffet table so I got some of the food Items and put them on a plate and had her touch them.  She knew it was cold so she only charged us for the soda. We've eaten here before probably a year prior to this visit and everything was hot and taste good. New management perhaps?< /Text>

<Text>I only gave one star because that was the lowest option. I brought my family here for a birthday celebration for my mother. The hostest seated us, not even two minutes after sitting down a cockroach walks across our table. I will never take my business to this location. We let the waitress know we were leaving due to a cockroach running across our table and she must have not understood what had just happened because we received no type of apology or acknowledgment. This place should not be serving food to customers.< /Text><UserId.>108977589796764316529< /UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

For 10.99 I filled my plate with all the shrimp, rice, and veggies I wanted. Even had a bowl of soup. Can’t beat that price for that at too many places. It was delicious! I’m satisfied with the food and price. Place was nice and cool too for n a hot day.</text>

My family and I always go here to get some Chinese food. We realized the food changed, we didnt think nothing of it. As we're eating the waitress brought us our bill, we put our cash with the receipt as usual.  My kids see that people are getting crab legs, so we go get some too, we were looking forward to them. Next thing, the waitress takes our bill without the the money & charges us more.  It was not right of them!  Will not be going there again for this mistreatment. Would give no stars, but it is not an option.< /Text>

More people would allow them to rotate the food more often does keeping it hotter.

Went here for the first time today and the food was excellent. There were many options to choose from and the service was great. The price was decent for a buffet. For 2 people (drinks included) it was $27.</Text>

<Text>My wife loved the food when the other people managed it but since they have new management, The food is no longer hot and everytime I eat there I come home, my wife too with the runs. Their shrimp is look warm and I know they don't follow the proper Health Regulations about the temperature of the food.  So we decided not to go there any longer I gave one star only because I could not post a review unless I did. As for the bathrooms, they are always dirty.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80952b929cb5249f:0x21fb4a97b7909ff7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Maybe not the best place to take someones family to eat unless you're trying to save some money, but even then they can increase their standards a bit. At the very least I can say I've eaten here without getting sick so its at least edible but some foods are farr better than others. Would only recommend if you support local business which I do encourage< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This place is interesting, the food is decent especially their chicken wings, fries, beef, and rice...but it was a bit too salty for me. However,  I really did enjoy their fruits selection. Furthermore, the hygiene is standard for a buffet as well as customer service.< /Review>

We had eaten there a month ago. It must have been the time of day. This time was lunch time and most the food looked old and dried out. Too bad the time before was fresh and good. I was disappointed upon my second visit. Just being honest.<//Review>

Very sub par and low quality.  Salad features iceburg lettuce with cheap reject tomatoes and minimal other toppings.  Most meat was dry or overcooked.  Not worth the price unless you're willing to overload on rice, sugar, bread and starches. If you are in any way into food, stay away. If you are just looking to load up on calories this may be your place but be prepared to wash many things down quickly before you taste it.<//text>

Nice service, very delicious, there is snacks/deserts, food, fruits. Pizza for kids, about 45 bucks for a family of four but all you want to eat. BEST BUFFET BEEN GOING OVER 5 YEARS AND STILL BETTER THAN SAKURA OR ANY OTHER</review>

< Review>
Ever since me an my family moved from LA to Tulare, we have been looking for an Asian restaurants, we found one but in Visalia(King buffet) it's great but bit to far. We have always passed by this one, but never went inside. Until today, the fam and I enjoyed our stay, very calm and peaceful, people are nice. But the food 😭😭 brought me back to LA memory lane, very delicious😋 these guys deserve better. It feels like there so underrated cause it's hidden and aside of that rude people. I'm coming back here, with more people and newer customers. Thank you for the hospitality and delicious food 🙏🙇.
PS: Oh and the best thing, it's pay per person, not per plate 😊< /Review>

Worst place ever...  I hope the manager gets to see this review.  You can’t have a restaurant operating with not sufficient AC, no folks for 20m!!! And half of the food trays were empty on 06/16/19 definitely not never coming back.< /Review>

<Review>Dont ever buy take out! I got 1 plate to go and it was $21. 73 for 3 lbs of food.

Brfore it started at $10 then a few times then$12 then it was $14 After that i stopped going. It was cheaper to eat there with a soda an unlimited food...

Its been a few months now i get charged over $20.</Review><userid>117475100668879798734< /userid><rating>1<//rating>< pics>

Very pleased to finally be able to put a label on the absolute worst buffet I’ve ever had. It’s an exciting milestone in ones life.
While the caliber of people in the dining area usually give a good indication of how the food is, I figured I’d give the food a chance since I’ve been surprised in the past. Alas, I was met with dismay.
Place was very busy. Which surprises and depresses me that so many people would suffer through the food here, and quite possibly return for more.
EVERYTHING was bad. There have been many Chinese buffets where the Chow Mein was awful, or the orange chicken was dry and over cooked, but at least the place could be redeemed by the spring rolls. Nope. Not here. Every dish, side dish, soup, entree, salad, and dessert item was exceptionally bad. I tried every single thing in hopes of finding something, anything worth the trip inside.
Nothing.
In this town, there are an overwhelming number of better food options that are too close by (even in the same parking lot!) to pass up if you think “this review is just a fluke”.
If you are a nay sayer, please. Experience this for yourself. It’s a good life lesson and an even better feeling to be able to place a stamp on the worst place you’ve ever eaten.<//text>

<review>Upon arrival, I was greeted promptly. I was sat at the rear of the resturant away from the patrons inside the resturant. (There was only maybe 15 to 20 people.)

The lack of selection really hurts this business. The food they had out was tasty; however, some of the dishes were old and needed much attention. Not too bad of a place.< /review></record>

<Time>1366396984836<//Time><Rating>3< /Rating><Review>I love chinese food, and have tried pretty much every place in Tulare. When this place first opened it was my favorite. It seems though that in the past few years, their standard for food quality has dramatically decreased. My family and I went there at about 5pm for dinner. Upon sitting down with my plate it became obvious that most of the food had to have been left over from lunch!! This is not acceptable to me as I have been in the food service industry for over 5 years. This saddens me about this place as it used to be a favorite of mine, but I do not plan on ever returning.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>This was our first time eating here and our last for sure. The food is gross they have like nothing to choose from. We are a big fan of chinese food! To top it off I paid with my Card and got a call from the bank that they had charged me double as if 60 wasnt enough for 4 people called the next day and asked to talk to the manger and the lady that answered Named Lin refused to give me the mangers name! Thank god My bank is going to return my money back! Seriously worst place ever and dont go here you will be disappointed!<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>
