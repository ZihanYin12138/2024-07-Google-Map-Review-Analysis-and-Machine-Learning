<Rate>5< /Rate><text>FCP would keep closing for no reason. I called Apple and they asked if I had downloaded any new programs and I said yes 10 yesterday from Pixel Film Studios. I could tell they thought that may be the problem. Long story short I just finished with PFS and after trying their best to diagnose the problem and spending an hour with me, the problem wouldn't repeat itself (Of course not????) So the said when and if it happens again, please send us the report and we can help you again. Now that is great, great customer service. I would have hung up on me.

I recently purchased the MBP M1 and was updating my Pixel Film Studio plugins. I ran into an error (a bit self induced I might add), I opened a support chat with PFS and received outstanding support. The agent went above my expectations. The service was outstanding and the agent was knowledgeable. If there was a question, they dug deeper and provided detailed explanation and insight.

Nearing the end of an important video production, just starting to tighten up the edits, clean up the sound and define the colour profiles when I realised that, not only had the operating system automatically updated itself overnight along with my editing software but consequently there were now some compatibility updates available for several of my plug-ins and (foolishly, as it turned out) I decided to install the updates... Unfortunately, this didn't quite go according to plan and one of my plug-ins, which had been used extensively throughout the production, decided to disappear and the dreaded "Red Screen" appeared wherever that particular plug-in had been used.
However, and this is where the Five Stars come in, when I contacted the Live Chat facility at PFS for support, I was definitely given the Five Star treatment by everyone I was in contact with (or thing, there's definitely a wee bit of AI in them there responses at the start of the process... a Chat Bot) and then the online support proved to be understanding, knowledgeable and extremely patient. Assessing the situation from screenshots of my setup and system, they made suggestions and gave me clear, concise directions of how to proceed and, after what felt like a socially-distanced sleight-of-hand and a virtual wave of the magic wand, Hey Presto... everything that had been missing reappeared in the video and an enormous smile appeared across my face.
So, it's an absolutely fantastic support service. I can't recommend the products any more highly either - in normal circumstances, they work seamlessly within FCPX and this situation seems to have been caused by a mischievous software gremlin materializing in the works... or more probably, hackers from a rival production company trying to figure out what we do to get such great results. I'm happy to tell them straight out -  You need to use Pixel Film Studios for all your post-editing plug-ins... They're just great!
The moral of the story, by the way is "You shouldn't ever install updates in the middle of a production - You just don't know what might occur!" ;o)<//Text>

Extremely happy with the support offered while I was stuck!

And generally plugins work rather smoothly.

What could Improve:

Sometimes usage is not very intuitive. This also might be because I was transitioning from Premier. I am willing to give usability consultation if you need.<//Review>

Truly fantastic support team and products. I got my plugins just for two days, and I am ran into tons of problems due to my lacking of experiments of video making. The support team got me an appointment with developer next day. Took the guy just an hour to get me, a fishing hunting guide to make all those magic charges with my footage. Now I have colour tuned zoomed and auto followed footage of me shot the Moose. I am very happy man now. If you got into this new, you got to try those plugins.</text>

As a filmmaker who owns a production company its always important to stay ahead of the trends and I strongly believe Pixel Film Studios has products that not only elevate any project, they have very reasonable prices which is great for low budget filmmakers who may not be able to shell out a lot of money but want to still look like a lot of money was spent. This is super important and it's refreshing to know I can go to Pixel and see a bunch of really high-tech EASY TO USE products that wont make me go broke. I think their business model is, offer great products for a great price and that will build loyalty with the costumers, at least that's how feel.

I've looked at other post production plug-ins but I've yet to see the level Pixel has, and again for the price, it allows me to offer my clients top notch videos without going anywhere near over budget. One of the key elements to any professional is to be able to produce a film that looks like more money was spent. If I look at my director reels from my past compared to what I now have with Pixel plug-ins, it's night and day. And when I'm able to produce a short film, it's an awesome feeling I have low cost but high level options with Pixel to make whatever I'm working on look like I spent more money on. So if lets say I'm playing around with my camera and come up with a 2 minute short film but I want it to look good enough to put on my website (obviously the script and directing has to be good) I can add their plug-ins to give it that high-end look that makes what was a no-budget film now a  "Oh he spent some money," type of film. This is really encouraging for me as a filmmaker and it should be for others as well.

I don't normally write reviews but I think when you find a company that's doing the right thing, it's important to give them a virtual high-five!< /Text>

I have been using PFS plugins since 2017 and have yet to have any issues with plugins. They are always bringing in new items that make my editing style improve. The customer support has quick responses and there are so many self help tools available. The plugins are user friendly and most importantly high quality.<//Text>

<Review>Love them, great customer service and theres always so many versatile  plugins. You can't go wrong ordering from Pixel Film Studios. I was hesitant as a first time user for final cut pro, but they also provide videos, step by step help on their website so you can also learn at your own pace.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Recently I ran into trouble using one of the plugins from Pixel Film Studio (ProText Volume 8) when stacking animations on top of one another. I tried all methods on their site as well as forums, but couldn't improve the speed of FCPX. I contacted their customer support, which couldn't have gone smoother. The agent quickly came online, asked a few questions, diagnosed the issue and instantly improved the quality of the plugin and my ability to seamlessly navigate the timeline. I own a few plugins but Pixel Film Studios and look forward to building my collection!<//review>

After installing my FCPX Auto-Tracking outline I had a problem the next day where the plug in did not work either as text or as an effect. After 15 minutes of directed action in the Live Chat we managed to solve the problem thanks to a new installation, following the instructions. I'm back in business and grateful for Pixel Film's support.</review>

I just became a user in Final Cut Pro a couple of months ago and there are a lot of sites that have plug-ins that could be overwhelming sometimes, especially with how to use them. Thankfully the great folks at pixel films have a great breakdown on how to install it and use it as well! Recently started using them and there are without a doubt one of the best! Looking forward to the next things that they're going to release!</Review>

I really like PFS effects, they have made the editing process a lot more fun and my videos look so much better.

As an editor of 25 years, having an affordable resource for helping me create effective and engaging content is pivotal! Pixel Film Studios hits all the marks and keeps growing and getting better. Still a few small things to tighten up, but well on their to becoming the industry standard for FCPX Plug-Ins!!< /review>

I have been using Final Cut Pro X for many years, and have come across quite a few different plug ins. I stumbled across Pixel Film Studios when I was searching for an easier way to track text. Well, I found Auto Tracker 2.1 and it is a miracle. I did have an issue while installing, but there Live Chat Support was very helpful and got me on the right track. This is a powerful tool that any serious video creator needs!</review>

Worst products ever. No clear instructions on how to use them. Nothing works or makes any sense. I just wasted $200 on this garbage. If you're not a Hollywood level producer, don't bother, impossible to figure out, plus half the time the select and mask pointer doesn't even appear, rendering the products completely useless<//text>

I have been a user of Pixel Films Studios products for a few years now and have used and loved the FCPX plugins I have bought from them. The costumer support is top notch. I recently had an technical issue with a plugin and the costumer support staff walked me through the sets to fix it. I highly recommend Pixel Film Studios to any new or old user of FCPX.< /Review>

I have been very happy with the quality of Pixel Film Studios plug ins for Final Cut Pro X. They really add the power of Apple's Motion within Final Cut Pro X so you can stay in one program for much of your visual effects. Have been impressed with their motion tracking & text effects. Great prices, easy installation & helpful tech support.</text>

<text>I have been using Pixel Film Studios plug-ins for Final Cut Pro X for the past 8 years and they have been getting better and better each year. They are not only affordable but the quality is excellent and only makes my videos look even better.

There are lots of really cool technical plug-ins that add an extra dimension to your footage and help with colour grading, lighting effects, motion graphics and titling. They are my go-to provider for FCPX plug-ins and I have them on 'speed dial' on all of my Mac computers.

During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, they have been extremely responsive and helpful with any technical issues. The support staff have been amazing!

Also, now that they have introduced the new PFS App 2.0 it makes it so easy to keep track of all your plug-ins and installed/purchased software.

I can't recommend them enough!</text>< Rating>

The rep was very helpful. Even caught me by surprise because I thought I was going to have to wait until Monday tor receive help. They were able to help me without even having to do a screen share. Once they told me a couple steps it worked. I love their site honestly, they're always helpful.< /text>

<Text>I purchased the Auto tracker 2.1 plugin because I needed to create a video for a client and this plugin was the solution to my problem. Just like the video said it DEFINITELY saved me TIME and now I don't have to do key framing to track something. When I purchased it and started to use the plug in, I followed the instructions, but I was having a little bit of difficulty. I contacted the live support and they helped me out really quick. The video turned out great and professional! The tracking looks great and A LOT better than when I do key framing. Great product, great customer service. Highly recommend.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm an avid fan of Pixel Film Studios! Having purchased many (many many) plugins, they have assisted me greatly in creating in-house corporate videos for: trade-shows, marketing, visitor welcome, employee shop floor videos and more! I've had excellent response both from customer service support - and any suggestions I've sent in have been received with a full welcome. The latest plugin bundles have ramped up even higher levels of value at a great price - and the addition of content over time increases the value EVEN MORE of the bundles! What's not to like about that?

Will definitely be buying more Pixel Film Studio plugins again!</Text></record>

No matter is you are a professional or hobbyist you will always find a plug-in that will set your videos out from the rest. The one thing I can’t get over is the price! Not only are they already so affordable but they are constantly having even further discounts. I recommend downloading their free installer app that not only keeps all your plugins up to date and nicely organised but it also prompts you when they have special discount days.

<Text>Nearly perfect tools to enhance FCPX. I was looking for alternatives to the built-in, boilerplate suite of transitions and titles and Pixel Film Studios delivered just that, as well as a robust selection of different effects. A scant few are dated looking, clunky and unsubtle, and installation can present some unpleasant surprises, but overall exceptional tools to quickly add variety and function to Final Cut Pro.</Text>< response>

<Review>Pixel Film Studios plug-in products are some of the best available, affordable resources for the budget-minded professional and amateurs alike. I can think of no better developer for FCPX resources than Pixel Film. It's should be every at home editor's one stop shop.<//Review>< Pics>

I had a positive and helpful interaction with customer support. I had purchases a plugin, this was the fourth plugin I have purchased with PFS but it was more complex then previous plugins. The plugins do not come with instructions so I watched the sample video on how to use but it was not quite enough information. So I reached out to customer service/ tech support and received a relatively prompt response. The agent answered my questions as I asked them, as I was using the plugin actively. This was quite helpful. When I ended my interaction I was more knowledgeable on how to use the plugin. It is a bit of a complex plugin and I may have more questions but I know if I reach out to customer service I will find the information I need.< /text>

< Review>
Top-quality product for Final Cut Pro X, plugins are easy to use and my number one choice! I have used the plugins for editing my aerial work, including transitions and effects. PixelFilmStudios has allowed me to work efficiently for my video editing saving me time and money. To weather, I am looking for cinematic effects, Luts, effects, transitions, etc. Pixel Film Studios offers a wide range of products that provide top quality for my projects.  I highly recommend this product to cinematographers that are entry-level and experts as well. There is no discrimination at the level you standing my number one choice is Pixel Film Studios.< /Review>

A couple bugs, but they sorted it all out. Now it's working great. Awesome effects! (make sure to check M1 compatibility, because every plugin I bought is not compatible with the M1 yet, so I can't use them. I hope they hurry up and recompile these.)<//Text>

I've using Pixel Film Studios for years.  One day I did a search for plugins for FCPX and PFS was one site that popped.  I visited the site, looked at their plugins, followed up with some videos that were posted of the effects being used and gave it a try.  I've been purchasing consistently ever since.  At least once a month I find something new that they provide that will help elevate my project in some way.<//Review>

<review>I have are searched numerous companies who offer FCPX plugins. By far, Pixel Film Studios is the most user- friendly and affordable. I’ve bought many plugins from their website and they all work perfectly. Their plugins have cut my video editing time in half!  Signup for their email list as they’re always offering daily discounts and sales on their products. Highly recommended if you want your projects to pop and look professional! —Kramon C.<//review>< UserId.>

< Review>
My favourite for Final Cut Pro X plugins. I've been using Pixel Film Studios' plugins for a few years now. The quality, functionality and pricing have always been on point. Plugins are normally a waste of money if they don't do the job, are complicated to use or constantly freeze/crash. PFS's plugins are made for people like me who need plugins to help deliver client projects. They are reliable and offer great value for money. Keep up the great work!< /Review>

I'm pretty new to both using FCPX and also video editing in general so, I went crazy and bought a bunch of different plugins which allowed me to be able to do a lot of really cool things.  Most of them worked awesome and were very intuitive however, I was having problems with the ProFire and ProSmoke with my system freezing and slow.  I contacted the customer services and they let me know that my original file needed to be formatted to the file format of the project which resolved my issue.  The customer support is awesome!  Thanks again for the help!< /text>

For many years I've use Pixel Film plugins and they have been a life saver.  From adding snow flakes to adding phone text conversations to music videos: I used ProSparkle, ProSnow V2, ProSparkle & in another Video we did that has close to 10 Million views we used ProMessage. Pixel Film Studios is my absolute go to! I would love to see more consistent video sample tutorials to see all different creative angles these amazing plugins can be used for.<//review>

<review>I recently bought 6 FCPX plugins from Pixel Film Studios.  I have had a fee issues in my first day but most of them have been related to me not reading information that iOS clearly available on their wen site.

Each plug in has a system requirements section, and had I read it before hand I would not have experienced some of the issues I have had.

I have just been through a simple and efficient technical support chat that has answered all of my questions. I now have my compatible plug ins up and running with no issues at all thanks to some greta and speedy tech support.  Much appreciated. I will be upgrading my Os and FCPX so I can buy more of these great plug ins.<//review><GmapID>0x80dce8adb4a3e88f:0x5a523da12db4f173</GmapID><Date>1584650565233<//Date><userid>108799395739286851997<//userid>< Rating>

<text>Recently I had a problem with my order history and PIXEL FILM support was excellent in resolving my problem. They worked with me over several days until the issue was resolved. I have ALWAYS found Pixel Film Studios to be one of the BEST sites for obtaining well tested and diverse plugins for Final Cut Pro. I would certainly recommend this Company to anyone needing plugins fort their video editing.</text>< Pics>

Love Pixel Film's plugins. I use them in my video content every time and are the best in the industry...hands down. Their video tutorials are also great and make it easy for install and use right away. Recently, I had an issue with one of the plugins not working due to a OS update. I reached out to their online support and within minutes they fixed the issue and my plugins are working great. I've been using them for about a year and they are my go-to site when ready to buy a serious and inspiring plugin.</Review>

<Review>Now that Pixel Films has opted for its robot chats, I had doubts about the service they would give me, however, with a validation problem, once again I was satisfied with the attention provided.

This, in addition to the work they do with the design and optimization with their plugs, always makes editing work more efficient.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Had a problem while trying to install the plugins after the change to macOS Catalina, the customer support was very fast and efficient.
It'll help to send screenshots of the User Interface of the PFS Installer.

My problem was due to usage of a VPN Service while downloading and installing the plugins, so make sure that you turn of your VPN Service while downloading and installing the plugins.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1576512365805, 'text': 'We do our best to provide quick and efficient customer support.

A product is not only about price and performance, it is also about a support infrastructure. I messed up an installation, and the Pixel Film Studios team jumped on the case, remoted in to my FCP X NLE and solved the problem immediately. Very good work!< /Review>

Very puzzling to see the negative reviews of the plugins. We have bought several and so far all work very well as advertised. For us, Pixel Film is a huge value and very useful. Have not got into using all of them, but first 5-6 are great. Saved huge time. If one person has really written over 1,000 products, he is quite industrious.</review>

<review>This seems to be a one man show shop run by David Austin, who only a couple f years ago still was doing wedding videos. So far i purchased only a handful for their plugins, one of them did not work at all, and support people(likely the guy himself faking another name etc) is not fixing the plugin at all, but this  support conversation keeps on answering questions i never had asked, i am guessing to satisfy a conversation with themselves.  Since 2014 this plugin has never worked, and this one man show, David Austin , is hiding behind a seemingly serious store. I do Not want my money back, i want this software to work as advertised , or that he stops selling nonfunctioning software. i would advice everyone out there to look for plugins somewhere else, very shady shop here ! it seems that 3 of 4 reviews are written by David austin or his wife Christine Austin themselves, a clear conflict of interest here.< /review>< Resp>

ich hatte das Problem, dass ich meinen Audio Visualizer 2 nicht richtig installieren konnte, weil bei mir die richtigen Einstellungen fehlten. Zwar zeigte es bei der Installation, dass diese abgeschlossen war aber die Schrift zeigte rot. Somit habe ich das Supporter Team kontaktiert und diese haben mir mit viel Geduld versucht zu helfen und haben dann auch schließlich das Problem gefunden und gelöst. Ich bin sehr zufrieden. Danke nochmals<//Review>< Pics>

He always offers the best prices compared to department stores, and you can trust that his products are authentic! I highly recommend coming here.<//Review>

I have been coming to this store for years. And Ras has always taken care of me with a personalization that I would expect in a Rodeo boutique. I have always been greeted with a professional, and warm familiarity! The inventory has never disappointed. If he doesn't have it, most likely it's due to discontinuation. And even then, Ras knows a scent that will fulfill the vacancy of a discontinued scent.</text>

Go and see Ras at Luxury Perfumes. He is the nicest and most informative gentleman. He's always finding great new scents. Whenever I'm shopping for a gift and need a great perfume or cologne I always go see Ras. It's like he knows what you like before you do. You won't be sorry.< /review>

The best luxury colognes and perfumes. He will hook you up with the best of the best. He got colognes that Macy's don't even have and they are not the knockoff colognes you see at the swapmeet either. Fellas if you want to smell good and get the best colognes, go to dell amo mall and get hooked up. If you need something for you wife or girlfriend,  go there and get some perfumes too. Ras will hook you up. Best in the business< /review>

<Review>What can you say about PERFECT! My wife and I have been using this place for the past few years and 5 stars is all we have ever experienced.  My wife loves the creed series of perfumes and they are quite expensive. My man, Ras, has always given us the best deal possible. I would never go anywhere else but to Ras. If he doesn't have it, he'll find it. No one will ever beat his prices or customer service. When I get low,, all I do is call and when it's ready, I go pick it up. If you want to up your "Smell Good Game", go and see Ras. You will not be disappointed.  You name it, he has it!<//Review></record>

Overpriced. You can buy the same brand for less online from Amazon as well as from any store.<//Review>

Anyone looking for perfume as a Valentine gift look no further than Luxury Perfumes at Del Amo mall. There's a great selection and fantastic prices that you'll never go back to the department stores. Plus they are really nice and extremely helpful.< /review>

<text>I have been a solid customer for this store for many years because they always have a great price and customer service. The owner is very nice and he always take care of us. Since I am very difficult with my choices he always provide me with samples and smell so I always leave happy, and also not to mentioned that he is very patient too. Overall I am very happy with this store and I highly recommend to anyone who is looking to buy colognes or perfumes. Great prices and great services!<//text>< GmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I've been going here for years. Everytime my husband and I run out of our favorite cologne or perfume we go visit Luxury Perfumes. They are always very welcoming, provide great recommendations and we always walk out feeling like we got a great deal. The experience is like a concierge service for perfume/cologne to find the right scent for you. I highly recommend visiting then next time you're in need or to just to grab a gift. Who doesn't like a nice perfume!< /review>< pics>

<review>I’ve been coming to Luxury Perfumes for years.  Raj has helped me find the best smelling perfumes with the best prices ever! Macys and Nordstrom’s perfumes are too highly priced but Raj does his best to compete and give you less prices than the Dept stores.  Rah is very professional and has the best knowledge in perfumes and colognes. Don’t waste your time and money at a Dept store, Come to Luxury Perfumes at Del Amo!!<//review><user_name>Debbie Days< /user_name>< gmap_id>

You'll get a great Cologne or Perfume of your choice and maybe even 2 or 3 because Ras will work with you on the price. I've been going here for several years and Ras always remembers me and has a huge smile on his face, and he's one of the warmest guys I've ever met. I could go on, but I'll just say if you're looking to get pretty much any Cologne or Perfume you could think of, at an amazing price, with great customer service included, please go  see Ras at Luxury Perfumes in the Del Amo Mall. I truly think you'll find what you're looking for and leave happy that you tried this place. Cheers!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

My friend “Ras” has been taking care of me and my friends for years.  For years I over spent in cologne and purchasing perfumes at Macys or other retail stores, one day I just happened to be walking out and came across Luxury Perfumes.  From the minute I entered “Ras” greeted me and went straight to the point.  He said, “What’s the occasion my friend, Who is She, First Date, Anniversary, Night of Town, Birthday or Business?” I was impressed, “Ras” was not just trying to make a sell, but wanted to help me out and understand what my need was.  Since that day I been going to him, and every time he takes care of me.  Anyone writing bad reviews or saying he sells too expensive on other sites is a complete fool and liar.  Bless those that take care of you, and I can honestly say “Ras” has blessed me.  Thank you friend...expect to see me come again and again.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>No. I despise this place every time I walk by. The workers here sneer and say "ni hao" to all Asian people walking by, because they don't stop to smell their samples. They laugh if you tell them you're not Chinese in perfect English. Don't waste your time here. Do not support this kind of service.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1558817750568, 'text': 'i am not sure you came to the right place .because we have a good customer service but anyway sorry for that'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

Such a smooth and simple process. We test drove two vehicles and finished paperwork in an hour! We are so happy and will be back. Brenden was super helpful, kind and didn't make us feel pressured.</text>

<Text>Roy's provided me with a vehicle at market value with a clean Carfax report. Unfortunately, after six months of infrequent use, the car has a major motor issue. For a car costing 14k, having a repair bill of a third of that price after not even 10k miles of driving, is extremely disappointing. I don't know the kind of inspections they do on their cars, but for mine, I got an extremely expensive lemon. I will avoid them in the future.

Update: The owner of Roy's reached out to me and offered to replace the motor at cost. After paying the mechanic I had taken it to ($1000) I was able to move the vehicle to Roy's where a salvaged motor was installed ($1500). I was without my vehicle for approximately 3 weeks and ended up paying an extra $2500 in addition to the purchase price. If I had known this I wouldn't have bought it obviously. I still own the vehicle, and the new motor seems solid, however I now have a permanent check engine light and cruise control that doesn't work and that severely effects my ability to resell it. A lesson to always take cars your interested to an independent mechanic prior to a purchase.< /Text>< Pictures>

The best experience that I have has at any dealership. Brenden was a big help and got us a car less then 1 hour in and out. Is very prompt, answered all my questions over text and got us a great deal. Better then I thought. Highly recommend working with this dealership and Brenden.</Review>

I will give them credit for trying to “make things right”. I went in to make my down payment and they had been willing to work with me on fixing my car. Unfortunately with mine and my wife’s busy schedule we are unable to make an appointment. I will be getting the vehicle fixed sooner by a mechanic closer to home.</Review>

Not the kind of person we want to do business with. Too bad for the salesman, he had good personality and a good chance at the sale.. We don't need to finance and certainly don't need the hassle.< /Review>< rating>

Called them and asked about a Jetta, I said I am only going pay $10k for it and I am driving over an hr for it, sales rep on phone said they could work with me on that price I offered. Upon arrival they swapped salesman on me and then preceded to say there's no way they could come close to the price I offered! Also upon inspection of the car the passenger seatbelt was super moldy and rear window area was damp and musty, outside of the car was dirty not even washed. Will not be doing business with them the future especially when they can't even budge they're price from high blue book with complimentary mold with it.<//Review>

I stumbled upon Roy's autos when I was looking for a used car of a particular make and price. I nervously picked up the phone, afraid of the typical used car salesman approach.
But I was totally - and pleasantly - surprised.
My experience with Roy's has been friendly, genuine and positive the whole way through. They had a carfax report paid for and ready to go, they texted me photos of the report and other details about the car, and they priced the car reasonably relative to Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book pricing.
I even needed a little extra help from them in getting the car trucked to my location several hours away, and they were helpful and smooth throughout.
I recommend Brandon specifically since he did a bunch of the legwork on my transaction, but the whole staff and management were friendly and genuine throughout. I'm impressed & would totally endorse Roy's!< /review>

< Review>
This place is awful bought my first new vehicle from them and it  was a bit pricey they refused to go down, the truck had an oil leak agreed to fix it then there was a squeling noise coming from it i told them it wasnt my belts and they refused to listen to me and still replaced belts yet the squel is still there.. check enigne light has come on 3 times within having the truck for a little over a month all they did was clear it.. so this last time it came on i took it somewhere else turns out the code its throwing is my camshaft position timing sensor. On top of all that the truck has been in a wreck! Hardly noticeable unless your really really paying attention to every detail but still this is a  2011 with only 76,000 miles on it. I bought a new truck to not have to worry about problems like this. Now its sitting until i can get it fixed.. honestly i would suggest going elswhere!</Review>

<text>I wish there was a way to leave 0 stars. Our family ordered a cake PAID for a special occasion 3 months in advance and even called a week in advance to confirm. The day of the occasion there was no cake in sight, rude service and you could see them scrambling to get our cake done after it was not made.

I came here for my tamale masa on Christmas eve. While the lines do tend to get really long and the store is really small which makes for a really cramped location, I'd say it's well worth it for the mass! It's delicious and moist and makes a big difference for your tamales. It was my first time making them and by myself! They were still a great hit.</Text>

The tamales are really good but every time I have ordered a dozen they always came undercooked. The middle part would still be raw. Hopefully this can be addressed. Overall, food and bakery is delicious.<//Text>

<text>This is one of my favorite Bakery is because they have the best tamales that I've ever had. I think I've only had only one tamale that tasted a little better than there's plus their tamales are very big. Everything else here is okay I've never really ordered lunch but I do like the bakery especially the cakes really good tres leches cake</text>< resp>

<text>I came here for my tamale masa on Christmas eve. While the lines do tend to get really long and the store is really small which makes for a really cramped location, I'd say it's well worth it for the mass! It's delicious and moist and makes a big difference for your tamales. It was my first time making them and by myself! They were still a great hit.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2b6607f6f4a67:0x49127b9708831251<//gmapID><name>Hazar Diaz< /name><date>1546542155505<//date>< resp>

A good place to get great bread and good tamales, specially the corn ones.

Plus you'll find variety of mexican products, groceries, juices and smoothies made freshly; all within a friendly environment.</Text>

Ahira if they are friendly and give you a very good and fast service, not like before, when they only passed each other by pkaticando and did not serve the clientele.
I will definitely come back

(Translated by Google) Perfect bread and service but I would recommend putting the name of each bread and what they are made of. The reason I say this is that I reached out and grabbed a bread that I thought was vanilla flavor and it turned out to taste sour cream.

(Original)
Pan y servicio perfecto pero recomendaria poner el nombre de cada pan y de que estan echos. La razón porque digo esto es que llegue y agarre un pan que pense que era sabor vainilla y resulto sabor crema agria .< /Text>

Its an old, established motel in the heart of Redding. Has a great restaurant next door that serves great food. The staff is friendly and rooms are clean. The swimming pool is clean and well kept, great in summer.<//text>

The other lady that works here is rude and tries to intimidate you and I heard she steals people's money and she a drunk. the only thing good about this place is Lulu's next door where you can grab something to eat they also have a bar there.oh and one more thing about the Ponderosa Inn is the owner videotape people in their company even when they check into the office I wasn't going to give the owner's name but now I will name is Sam he was arrested for drugs and prostitution it's all in the newspaper oh and they have mice and cockroaches<//Text>< Resp>

(Stayed here in June 2016) If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. When my family first got there, my friend and I were given a room that was almost completely empty. The staff had no idea why it was like that, and they just assumed the place had been robbed. The rooms were in terrible shape, there was a hole in our wall and the door that led to the next room where a stranger was sleeping would not lock. My friend and I felt the need to put a chair under the doorknob to make sure no one could get in. Not only were the rooms falling apart, but the beds smelled like someone had been sleeping there for months without bathing. The bed itself was rock hard (If I was brave enough, I would have just slept on the floor). Not only was the room terrible, but it sounded like a drug-bust was happening in the parking lot around 3 am. If we didn't need a place to stay for the night, this would not have been an option.

Needless to say, don't trust those "discount" hotel magazines, and sometimes sleeping in your car is a better option.

But, hey! No bed bugs!<//review>

<text>I checked in and was given a key card by the friendly lady in the office. When I got to the door, it was already open and none of the lights worked and the pillows from one bed was piled onto the other. I didn't touch the room; went back to the office asked for another room and was told that their housekeeper had NOT done their job. My money was refunded, but I will not be attempting to stay at ANY Ponderosa Inn in the near future due to this experience. Would give 0 stars if I was able to.</text><rating>1</rating><user_id>116697132438501343733<//user_id></record>

So.....
This story begins with me and my dad checking in around 8 p.m. now the ponderosa requires $100 deposit, and the room for two people was $78... We only had 140 bucks... After the girl behind the desk made us promise we would not trash the room, she let us slide into the room with a $61 deposit... Awesome!... We go up to the room slide the key card in to the door, open the door, and upon entering the dark room hear your voice saying "who's that?"followed by some grunts of a person just waking up from a dead sleep.....I quickly apologized explaining that they obviously rented me a room they already rented to someone else... After backing out and closing the door I went back to the front office leaving my dad just stand guard over our things while I straightened everything out in the office...after I explain the events to the two girls working behind the front desk I could tell by the puzzled look on their face that they in fact had NOT rented that room to someone else by mistake, and they had a squatter... PHONE RINGS...  It's my dad calling from that room talking to the girls, and tells them that the guy ran out of the room in a hurry... So now I'm looking for him to be making his escape down the tangle of stairs and walkways that are unique to this motel.when all of the sudden I see the guy pop up from behind a planter and start across the parking lot. One of the girls asked the other one who the hell is that? I said come on let's find out! I hollered out excuse me sir and the guy ran so fast he was gone in a moment and there was no point in chasing him cuz I was tired..... Why five stars? Cuz the general manager who lived in one of the rooms close by, quickly made up the room making the beds refreshing the towels and shampoo and conditioner... She then informed us that they couldn't take less than $100 deposit, so she gave us a break on the room! So we got that room for like $32 and change..... And the general manager didn't raise a fuss about the girls we had coming into the room that we did not pay extra for ... even when one of those girls accidentally knocked on the general managers door looking for us... She also didn't raise a fuss when my dad got us LOCKED OUT of our room in the middle of the night, and she had to come open the door for us..... out of a deep sleep.... As for the squatter, I hold no ill feelings towards someone just trying to get a good night sleep out of the cold... I've been there myself and done the very same thing though it was years ago and far away from here....< /Text>

Nicely situated...close to eating/drinking establishments...close to grocery store(Safeway across the street) and lovely Lulu's in the adjoining parking lot...two floors...nice heat/air conditioning in each room...clean & spacious...cereal & coffee EVERY AM IN SAME OFFICE YOU REGISTER IN...soda machine near front office for that late night soda-run. Managers are vigilant and keep hotel clients/cars SAFER DUE TO THEIR WATCHFUL EYES.The Ponderosa Inn is a sweet spot to lay yer hat, kick off yet boots, & say how-dee to Redding...they are remodelling and doin' it well...the ol' gals gettin a much-deserved face-lift 🏩🏫🌅🚘🚗🌛🌜🌞🌠🏆🏆🏆🎖️</Review>

They are working to fix and remodel dated rooms. Room was okay, no issue other than obnoxious people who can't shutup . Staff tried to quiet the problem. Hope it works out, used to be a 4 not a 1 to 2.< /review>

There were cockroaches and rats.
The housekeepers work drunk.
Big time hard drug problem at this place, junkies and tweakers running around all times of the day and night.
The pool was nice at least.<//Text>

Rooms are dirty. The place is located in a fairly bad part of Redding. I did see while I was there. The owners running off the bad elements, drug addicts, homeless, ect ect. I also seen rooms being renovated and cleaned up.. So maybe theirs hope for this place..</review>

Horrible quality​ rooms. First night we were placed in a room that was missing a TV and other things and we found out the door didn't even lock. We never needed a keycard. We were placed in a new room next to it the next day and it still wasn't much better quality wise. Both rooms were dirty in Thier own ways and looked like whoever owns it don't care about fixing anything. Chips in the wall, stains on the walls,floors press down in certain areas, and more. Also very uncomfortable beds and pillows didn't seem like actual pillows but more like sheets stuffed into one.<//review>

It is a low rent motel with monthly rates that cater to the homeless and drug addicted. High crime in the area and motel itself. There is no upkeep and insects are rampant.<//review>

< Review>
I usually go to the one in Lincoln heights but I was around the neighborhood so I got some here. honestly they give you sooo little chicken and beef! It may look like a lot after I cut the chicken in small pieces and the meat and I added some teriyaki on top that may seem like theirs more meat. but it was honestly very little portion on (meat&chicken). Overall the food had a good taste nice in the inside just wish they added more.</Review>

My husband and I were regulars here. We came here often that's changing as of tonight. Tonight I was walking by with my 7 year old son. No money on hand. I went in to ask if my son can use the restroom as he did the pee pee dance at the register. The woman turned us away because I couldn't buy anything today. She said "I'm sorry but our restroom is for customers only, I can give you the key but only if you order something right now and we'll get it started while your in the restroom." I told her that I unfortunately wasn't carrying any money on me so she turned us away. We will not be eating here anymore</text>

Newly opened Waba Grill at HighlandPark neighborhood. The staff are friendly and amiable. The food tasted fresh and clean. The manager, an asian guy, is friendly and attentive to customers. I'm glad they opened to add more variety of food choices along York blvd.<//review>

Has a very tight and small sparking lot but it is well worth the amazing food I got the chicken and cheese was super hot to order and great amazing taste it also came with the option for grilled onions. Very easy and basic menu to order from also the food is cooked super fast and there is very little wait time, also the restraunt is handicap friendly!<//Review>

We come here all the time. My daughter loves this place just as much as I do. We have been getting the Philly cheese steak for years now and are always excited to come. We drive from Lake Elsinore to get it and it’s worth.

Service is always great. Food is always top notch. I do wish they had the old fries tho. But other then that I would recommend this place.< /Review>

<Text>Great staff and friendly service:) The basic cheese steak is so good with their cheese fries. When i had togo of cheesefries they give cheese in a dip container so fries didn’t get soggy😇 Great attention to details! The cook was really nice! You can just feel that right away💓 - i hate soggy fries, everybody has that experience when you had fries togo< /Text>< date>

We got 3 samwhichs tonight. The cheesesteak and ham & cheese was great but the chicken parmesan looked and tasted like it was precooked days ago then thrown in the deep fryer agian for the order...
Practically burnt, dry and rubbery, and generally gross. Agian clearly precooked days ago then carelessly thrown in a fryer.
If I would have known it would have been like that I wouldn't have gotten it to begin with. With the reviews I expected a proper chicken parm samwhich....< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The best Philly's I've found so far. The taste is incredible but a big reason I drive out of the way to come here is the staff. Amazing young man worked the register and the cook was also phenomenally good people.</Text>

The food is good but hands down the best cook in town.  He remembers your name, the way you like your sandwich and always greets you with a smile and handshake.  He is only reason I continue to go back!!</review>

<Review>Always a favorite...great sandwiches and quick made to order food ! They reduced the amount of met they put in the sandwiches and kept the same price. They now offer extra meet for an additional price which is a backhanded way to up the prices, still a great meal hot and fast ! Will definitely be going back.< /Review><user>116051952177397786993< /user><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb58b7c512bf9:0xdd2448afa40bfd8b< /gmap_id>< date>

FOLLOW-UP VISIT:
So, a couple of weeks after my first post, I am back at the Mira Loma location and I am happy to report that the cleanliness is much improved. The condiment bar is clean and fully stocked. The bathroom is still old and in need of repair (the sink still leaks), but it's really clean this time. The food is great. The service is friendly and efficient.

Maybe I came after a dinner rush or with brand new employees who are still learning. Either way, much better this time.

The only critique I have is that the Chino Hills location has a frequent diner card, but I didn't feel like driving that far with the holiday traffic. Other than that, I am satisfied.

If this location fixes the bathroom sink and adds a frequent diner card then I will never have a reason to go to the Chino Hills location.

INITIAL VISIT (2 STARS): The staff is was very friendly but the condiment bar is unattractive and not well stocked. The bathroom sink leaks (more like pours onto the floor). My order wasn't entirely correct but the onion ring portion was larger than the Philly's Best in Chino. That said the one in Chino has a frequent diner stamp card, the staff is also nice, the manager is not, and their condiment bar is more attractive and the restaurant is cleaner overall.</Review>

Philly's best your all about the cheese otherwise you are no different from del taco except for your prices. Nothing worse than getting home and finding out your order is not right but to have a extremely dry sandwich is too much.

<Review>My experience here was not the best. I mentioned to the staff workers that I am from Philadelphia so I know my food would taste exactly like the food in the city (which it didn’t btw) but then The staff workers working that shifted mocked me then started to laugh like it was a joke. I let it fly but they weren’t the nicest people. They were very rude and you could tell they didn’t want to be there. You guys should hire people who actually want to give customers a great experience.< /Review>< pics>

<text>The food is always great but they don't put enough meat in their sandwiches. It's all packed at the top of the sandwich so theirs not meat in every bite.  Prices Are a little high for what you get.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Great customer service and the food is amazing! The cheese steaks are just as I remember from Philadelphia Pennsylvania visits. Every time I'm in town and looking for food this is my go to restaurant. I wish there was one closer to where I live or work.<//review>

< Review>
3.5 for me, closer to a 4 than a 3. I was in the area and whet here at the request of a friend that really enjoyed this place. A small background on me, I don’t eat very many fruits or vegetables, I just ordered a plain cheese steak meat and cheese which is probably different than others order.. I also ordered one order of fries.. both came out to around $10, average prices.. When I got the food it was for sure above average tasting but again just meat and cheese, small-medium portions, the French fries tasted store bought and very obviously under cooked.. solid place to mix it up for me and others RAVE about it.< /Review>

Food is great...We love the food and go often. The cook is always friendly and helpful.  The counter girl cashier needs some customer  service training. She has a bad attitude,  and is rude most of the times we've gone there, not friendly  at all...you'd  think she would be nicer since we're  there so often...and smile for goodness sake!</Review>

The cook is very friendly and knows us by name, greets us everytime we walk through those doors. Every time I have gone there is normally a crowd and sometimes no place to sit. The food is especially good, I mean where else are you going to find Boars Head pastrami? Delicious we go here at least once a week for lunch!< /review>< Pics>

I have eaten here numerous times, but lately, the cook, and the cashier seem to be playing a little scam with the meat. I have caught the numerous cooks that seem to flow in and out of there, purposely skimming the meat. While I am paying the cashier, I have caught the cooks, a couple of them, putting half, or smaller portions of that frozen meat on the grill. They try to dice it up as quickly as possible so the customer wont notice the shortage. One time I ordered TWO "Rocky" specials from the cashier. The cook was in back, so the female cashier put two single servings of the frozen meat on the grill. A "Rocky" special is double meat per sandwich, so she should have put FOUR single portions of frozen meat on. If you go there, make sure you watch that cook put the correct portion of meat on the grill before he starts chopping it up so you dont notice you have been shorted. Funny thing, the owner has cameras everywhere. I guess he would claim he had'nt noticed.< /text>

I walk in and the vibe is terrible, no type of greeting, and rude cashier/waitress whatever she is, probably explains why there were no customers in the building & a help wanted sign, when asking if the main dish came with sides they responded with a horrible attitude “if you want...”. OBVIOUSLY, if I’m asking.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I really like the sandwich here, it's super delicious! Every time I return to the US, I must come! Pastrami and steak sandwiches are very punctual! It’s delicious with the bite of jalapeno! With fried and crispy onion rings! I really can't eat so delicious in Taiwan! !

(Original)
非常喜歡這裡的三明治，超級好吃！每次回美國一定要來！pastrami 跟牛排三明治都很正點！跟著墨西哥辣椒這一口那一口的，美味極了！配上炸的又香又酥脆的洋蔥圈⋯天啊！在台灣真的吃不到這麼好吃的啊！！<//review>

This bar is a pretty awesome little spot to stop off and have a few beers and a couple shots. It’s also right next to the nicest motel six around so there won’t be any driving. The bar is awesome and don’t forgot to have a butter whiskey shot.< /Text>

It used to be Mollys but this place has upgraded. The bartender at night on the weekdays is awesome. She makes all her customers feel appreciated and wanted in the bar. The place is spotless clean and many beers and liquors to choose from. The best place to go to when you are in Barstow. I would give 10 stars but it only goes to 5. Thanx bartender...</review>

< review>
I would like to rate Norwegian zero stars but apparently that isn't an option.  Our flight to Paris in April was cancelled due to the pandemic.  Norwegian Air refunded my credit card in May, but unfortunately I no longer have an account with that bank, and they sent the money BACK to Norwegian in June.  I have been attempting to email and call Norwegian but there is NO customer service number; I have emailed them the bank letter stating they sent the refund back.  Now, 2 1/2 months since I emailed Norwegian the letter, I have heard absolutely nothing, and truly despairing that I will never get my money (almost $6000!!) back.  Even if I do get it back, I will never fly this airline again.  Communication couldn't possibly be worse.</review>

On a bunch of flights within Norway (like an hour long flight each), there were cartoons on the over-head screen. I'm pretty sure the only cartoon they show, though, is Tom and Jerry.
I'm not sure if they do this at every airport, but passengers can either go from the front of the plane or the back for exits, which is nicer compared to waiting in one line to get out like most airlines.
However, the staff themselves could care less about your experience. Most flights i've been on are quiet, but when I complained about the extremely noisy passengers, the attendant didn't do anything. I asked her again if she could politely ask the (probably drunk) men to at least quiet down just slightly, but she just said I was being disrespectful. Huh?</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><text>It's my first flight with Norwegian airlines and l was very pleased!  We booked a round trip to Paris, France with premium amenities.  We liked the oversized seats and it's functionalities. Collapsible dinner tray and tv screens.  The bathroom was clean and always replenished by the attendants. Windows tint electronically, no shades are required. A special lighting throughout the aircraft is designed to help sleeping and waking patterns. The cabin is low pressurized which helps recovering from jet lag.
It is a great new way to travel for a low fare with very scarce amenities or pay a higher fare but enjoy a first class seat and some extra perks ( free access to the 1st class lounge in all airports, priority boarding, food, beverage, blankets, earphones, no fees on luggage etc.)
Our premium fare costs us what we normally would pay for an economy coach with no frill.
Norwegian airlines with premium upgrades is the way to go!
I would have given it a 5 star but it has fee minor glitches as if now.  Counter agents were nonchalant and didn't smile at all.  They sent us to the coach waiting line when we showed them our premium status tickets.  On board, l asked for a cranberry martini, (it was on the drink menu and free for us). Hostess said she only had pineapple, coke and OJ. I replied l was ok with pineapple, then she said now wasn't a good time (!).  An hour later l pointed out another drink from their menu, she again declined to serve it.  I am thinking that their cocktail menu is just for show and they really don't offer it (deceiving).  They have readily available: beer, wine, Bailey's. Do not expect glass, silverware. All is served in disposable items.  This is what separates a true first class.     When flying with Norwegian, do not expect to be attended to with great attention, fed amazing food and more.  Instead expect to fly with a lot more room than in coach, check in quicker and receive all listed amenities. It's definitely worth flying with them.  Good value!< /text></record>

Norwegian credit card.
New airplanes, affordable prices, reasonably good service and possibility for gaining travelpoints for future discounts. However if you have Norveigian credit card and you make an automatic payment through your bank, Norveigian system will punish you by charging 30€ every month for the service!!! So you loose most of your hard earned points. If you pay by separate transfer every month, it is free! The initial credit limit is 3000€.The policy does not make sense! It cherishes Norveigian but let dow their clients.l😒✈💺< /Review>

Enjoyed my first flight to Oslo.  The attendants were kind and accommodating.  The seats were comfortable and worth the price.
The second plane wasn’t so comfy and the food was priced in a country that we hadn’t told our bank about and we didn’t want to chance it.  They did hold the plane for us for as our flight from JFK was so late.   All in all it was a great flight!<//review>

Plz don’t chose this airline especially if u r black or Asian. Very racist and customer service sucks. They pure work ethics are bases on lies. I travel twice and they pick and chose to serve. If ur skin color is darker bro best of luck. I made video how they served me in airport. Shout for those who are looking to chose airline with some excellent customer service.<//review>

<user_id>114798939990239262133</user_id><text>The plane was good, the Dreamliner, the seats weren’t to bad, but we upgraded to the second level behind premium, the attendants were pretty impersonal. You only got two meals, if you purchased, and the choice of water, coffee or pineapple juice with/right after the meal. Nothing else any other time. They didn’t come around to offer drinks or snacks. You only saw them the two times. UNLESS you ordered/paid a snack in flight, then they would bring it to you. Otherwise they stayed in there little cubicles with the curtains drawn.
Very impassive personalities, everything was $ extra (blanket, water, snack).
Most likely not going to book with them again.<//text><rating>2<//rating><date>1533751501878</date>< gmap_id>

< Review>
First time Flying on Norwegian Air. I must admit the Price of the Flight was Very Good for a Direct Flight from LAX to Madrid Spain. However, I did not know I would be ignored the entire flight and not even offered a single cup of water. Everyone on any flight over 3-4 hours should be offered a free cup of water. Yet on my 10 plus hour flight, I was not offered not even a drop of water. The employees walk right past you as if you don't exist and only tend to the people who purchase a meal. This is INHUMANE! I will never purchase another ticket on this Airline again simply for this reason. We might as well be put in a cage and beg for water like an animal as this is how it feels like you are being treated by the employees of this Airline.<//Review>

<text>Norwegian is the absolute worst. There is a reason there is an entire Facebook community dedicated to "Norwegian experiences from Hell". Every single flight with them has had issues, especially with customer service but this last experience takes the cake.

Flight from Newark to Rome scheduled to leave at 11:30, first we were delayed getting on the plane by an hour. We get on the plane and get situated (with a baby who is dead tired) and 2 HOURS after sitting on the plane we are told over the intercom that a vehicle crashed into the luggage door and they were trying to fix it but they won't be able to so our flight is being cancelled. We then sit on the plane for another hour while they "make accommodations" for everyone since it is 3am. Well when we get off the plane and get to baggage claim there is no customer service representatives and they just tell everyone to "go home" well 90% of us could not go home so we asked the flight attendants and they said our best option was to get a hotel and they would call us to rebook our flight for the next day. So we paid OUT OF POCKET for a hotel, transportation, etc.

The next day we did not receive a call so we called and spent over 3 hours on hold (this is on the "phone line dedicated to our cancellation") just to be told that they didn't have any direct flights like the one we paid extra money to book originally until 3 days later and that they didn't have "clearance" to get us on a direct flight that day so our only option was to take a flight leaving at midnight that night with a 4 hr layover in Spain.

We accepted the flight since it was our only option but of course it was a huge inconvenience as we had to pay for another day at the hotel and Babies naps were all messed up from the insanity so the flight was pretty terrible but to make it worse they kept the overhead lights in the plane on for pretty much the entire 9 hr flight so my daughter struggled to sleep. When I asked when they would turn the lights off they said when people were done eating (this was 1am NY time). Funny because I thought that was the whole reason they have individual lights on seats- so that the entire flight doesn't have to suffer.

Here is the worst part though: we file our claim so we can get reimbursed and even on their website it says that if a flight is delayed more than 6 hours you are entitled to 600 euro per reservation. Well more than a month after the issue they get back to us basically saying that because it was caused by "circumstances which could not have been avoided" they won't be compensating us.

How is an employee crashing into the luggage door not something that is preventable? How about pay more attention or don't go to work drunk? I cannot believe that Norwegian would not take responsibility for such a complete disaster. I will never be flying with them again and I would not recommend them to anyone.

Oh and here is a bonus: on our flight home Rome to Newark I was denied a cup of water for the entire 9 hr flight and my "attendant" light was ignored the entire flight even though other people around us were given water when they asked and I am a nursing mother with a baby. Totally ridiculous.<//text>< pics>

<Text>It's a shame that you can't do zero stars for a review. This airline is by far the worst I've ever dealt with. Be aware of missinformation online.
Travelling with pets is not allowed on international flights even though it doesn't specify that on the webpage. It says that for DOMESTIC flights they allow certain countries, but nowhere it says they don't allow pets for international flights, or for any flight from the USA, even though in the US Norwegian Airline Webpage it gives you the option to add your pet online or on the phone.

We bought our flight looking at this info and when we tried to add our cat online it didn't let us, so we bought the flight thinking to add it on the phone later as instructed. They told us it cannot be done and also they will not give us a refund, even though our flight is not for a few weeks.

Both on the phone and on chat they didn't help us and said they cannot transfer to management.

Also, we purchased a more expensive option than the cheaper one, "flex"...this didn't help at all with refunds or any other possible help.

NEVER CHOOSE THIS AIRLINE! If I had seen the reviews before purchasing I would have never bought tickets with them. This is what you pay for. This is the worst airline ever, and customer service is the worst. I had to wait for a long time both on the phone and on chat until somebody responded.

There is a Facebook page called: "Norwegian Airlines Experiences from Hell"...why do you think this exists??</Text><user_name>dyc931< /user_name><rate>1< /rate>< pics>

Do yourself a favor and find a REAL airline that wants to retain customers. Just AWFUL experience with handling an unfortunate event. They'll do everything possible to make it next to impossible to change a flight. American/United/BA has never done this. Its an arm and a leg to change any tiny aspect of a ticket. If there is an unfortunate event and you can't fly, you're HOSED! Never again.<//Review>

I was supposed to leave for Paris until I received a text from Norwegian Airlines that my flight would be delayed 24 HOURS just hours before my flight. Their excuse for the delay? They were having ‘technical issues’ which doesn’t explain anything at all. At least I got a refund so I guess they deserve only one star after all.< /review>

I'll never fly Norwegian again. Our initial flight was delayed, which made us miss our connecting flight, even though Norwegian told us the plane was waiting for us. We sprinted over 1/2 mile to the gate with luggage and toddlers in hand, only to find out that the plane already left. The customer service has been terrible here in Norway. Least friendly staff I've ever seen. We've been ran around in circles by the staff on no sleep. Spend a little more money and choose a better airline.</Review>

<text>Flight doesn't come with food or drinks unless you purchase these separately. Norwegian doesn't even offer water to passengers who didn't order a meal. They pretty much ignore you if you don't order a meal. They make the flight temperature quite cold then charge you  $5 for a blanket. Staff is also quite impersonal. No Wi-Fi on flights.

<text>Worst customer experience ever in New York! The managers at the airport are ordered to milk the clients in all the ways possible with the luggages: the weight machine are clearly hijacked, the guys don't hesitate to lie about the fact that no luggage is included in your ticket to charge you 65$ on top.

=> Norwegian is a robbery industry !

I booked a flight from Barcelona to LA in December for a flight in June and so received a discount.  My flight left Barcelona airport about lunchtime. I was called to.the flight and then had to.stand in a queue for a long time as it turned out that this was the first time this airline was flying direct to LA. Long publicity campaign. No problem. However we were then segregated into groups. I was made to wait until the very end presumably because I'd paid less. I'd been travelling since four o'clock that morning and made to stand all this time to provide an audience for all the photos. Now in December when I booked early they didn't tell me you'll get a discount for booking early but we will treat you badly because you've paid less. I don't think I've ever been treated worse on an plane journey.</Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Never had a reason to actually rate an airline, but this one was terrible. We were flying from London Gatwick to Los Angeles and when I tried to check-in at the kiosk, it would not read my passport. Whatever, no big deal I’ll just check in at the counter. We encountered a young woman who was asking us the regular security questions about our bags being unattended, etc.. She asked if I had any sharp objects in my bag, I responded with “yes” because I had some old WW2 bullets that were recovered from Omaha Beach from Normandy. Now I’m a history teacher back home, so it was a very important and meaningful artifact to me. They had been drained of any gunpowder, linked together so as to prevent them from ever being loaded into a gun, overall completely safe. We had ZERO trouble with previous Airlines, transporting these across Europe, but these agents immediately got VERY snippy and smart with me. They kept asking me where they were from (I had told them three times), what was my purpose in having them, and then another agent started asking me about my profession and why these would be important to me, then denied me countless times. I had to drop them at a mail off kiosk.

Already extremely annoyed, we went trough the process of weighing our bags at the counter. My husband and I had three small bags between the two of us and unknown to me, each person is only allowed 10kg to carry on. My bag was 7, his was 13. So we started stuffing clothes into my bag and slowly got to the allowed weight. By their graciousness and mercy (🙄), they were approved. So we weighed our check in bags, each having to be only 20kg (honestly though?? What is with Europe and these TEENY bag allowances, I miss America). We were both over by a combined weight of 5 kg which we were forced to pay 45£ for!! FORTY FIVE POUNDS FOR 5 KG!!! What a complete JOKE!! I get that they’re cheaper, but what made it even worse was the attendant who was just berating us with insanely pricey offers of checking a third bag and paying 9£ for each kg. Just awful.

I will never fly this airline again, I hardly think I’m ever flying back to Europe again. Would have rather paid more for a better airline to get the service I expect than to be treated like that ever again.

**EDIT**

I will say that the flight itself was wonderful. The crew was accommodating, kind, and very helpful. The flight was enjoyable and the aircraft was very clean and modern. It was the preflight interaction that left a bad first impression. Maybe they should check the attitudes of those representing them on the ground. The flight crew was impeccable, too bad it wasn’t the same for the check in crew.< /text>< time>

<text>I have flown Norwegian to Europe twice  in the past year. It is less expensive than other airlines and the on-line booking and alerts are excellent.  But I may not do it again. The planes are new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, but with 9 seats per row, little front space and almost no recliner, a 10 hours flight is eternal. The video entertainment  is ok. We bought the "tasty" food package. It is not better than the non-tasty food of other airlines. The crew is indifferent, look tired or anoyed, and service did not make them happier. Pouring coffee without looking is always alarming; luckily the coffee was cold. The gates locations are at the end of the airport, with a long ride to the plane in a packed, hot bus, where we were treated by the crew like catle, complete with shouting and pressing those of us inside to accommodate more passengers, what was obviously difficult. So all the positive aspects were overshadowed by the shortcomings. I must admit that the competition with other larger, better known airlines is healthy, but they should not try to imitate them.< /text>< Pics>

Finally taking the time to write a review of our trip that we took to Europe last year 09/05/15 via Norwegian air . After some of the complaints we read about on Norwegian Air we were a little worried after we booked. But once we flew them we were beyond pleasantly surprised!

Keep in mind we also drove from Reno to Oakland and we still loved our experience with Norwegian Air.

We flew out 09/05/15 from Oakland, CA (USA) to Oslo, Norway cheaper than I could fly from Reno, NV to Las Vegas, NV.

Check in was quick and efficient as well as polite and respectful. We purchased one way cheap economy tickets

The plane was large, new, clean and crowded. But that what you get when traveling on a budget.

We booked early so my 6"4' husband had leg room near an emergency exit. I and my children are shorter than my husband and my daughter who is 5"7' felt she had enough leg room.

Each seat had a TV screen with games etc. in the seat ahead of them. These entertainment consoles are free to use unless you need to purchase headphones. My family brought headphones and we all played games, listened to music, watched downloaded TV programs or movies. This was all offered for free. I greatly appreciate this because in the old days there were one maybe 2 movies on an overseas flight and you didn't get to choose what you wanted it was chosen for you.

The console also let you see in real time where the airplane was in location to your destination. I thought this was pretty cool so did my son.

Each seat has a USB port and you can charge your phone or other device.

We paid extra for the meals and luggage. It was so worth the extra money.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food, the taste the appeal. I had curry chicken and rice with veggies I can't remember what the desert was but it was tasty. Then we were served a sandwich.

The airline attendants were super friendly and sweet. All we had was carry on. We did not experience any issues or difficulties with our trip. As a matter of fact we flew three more times within Europe on this one trip via other Airlines and my whole family agrees we would fly Norwegian Air again anytime. I traveled with my husband, 18 year old daughter and 13 year old son.

Thanks Norwegian Air for making it possible for a family to afford to travel to Europe again!!< /text>

The value being offered here is undeniable. Unfortunately their unreliable service and constant lateness in departures and arrivals is unacceptable.  Decent planes but the buck stops there. They're an embarrassement to the airline industry and a joke.< /review>

I just landed from Madrid to LAX a 12hours flight and they where charging for everything,$5 for blankets, $3 for water and only pass food two times I wa starving, dehydrated etc.  The flight was delayed 2 hours and 1/5 without notice, food quality was poor. It is the first time that I receive this type of service for an international trip. Very disappointed. They was. It aware about the charge for the food, probably it is in the bunch of emails that was sent by them with irrelevant information that is did not readed I was on vacation. When I tried to pre check in I couldn’t do it via website or app their website is confusing and at that point they did not mentioned anything about the food just a message sailing that check in should be at the airport even I am uSA citizen. They did not offer water at all to the rest of people.</text>

PASSENGERS BE WARY OF THIS SHADY COMPANY! This is the Spirit Airlines of international travel. They nickel and dine you to death and I have attempted 3 times to reserve a seat for my return trip from FLL to LGW and my credit card has been charged 3 separate times yet still no seat. The “customer service” agent I spoke too was not empowered to make anything happen including speaking to his supervisor. What a useless French idiot he was. Norwegian Air I really don’t know how you remain in business. However I will do all I can to share the unbelievable things I have incurred and witnessed on this trip with your airline and it’s team members. I will share this on any and all social media and hopefully this will deter even a few people to avoid supporting your ludicrous company and its service.< /text>

<Name>Renee Meraz< /Name><Time>1530883134427</Time><review>This airline will penny and dime every last service. Starting with the bags, they don’t do the standard 23kg, they do 20kg and if you’re over weight then that is about 10 euro per kilo! I had to pay for overweight checked luggage AND overweight carry on. (You can only have 10kg of carry on and I had 13kg) When you get to the plane, you expect the typical meal for a long flight but this meal will cost you 7$ for the sandwich and nope water is not included. Hand over an extra 4$. And 3$ for a tiny bag of nuts.
It’s a nice detail when airlines offer blankets and headphones but with Norwegian you will have to pay for each and on top of that you can’t even use it to your liking. You will get woken up a dozen times if your blanket is covering you seatbelt. Absolutely no respect for your rest. The aircraft lights don’t turn off thanks to some new fancy feature to minimize jet lag. I call bs. Good luck having the flight go by fast with a nap. Luckily, there is a new “award winning entertainment system” with a very small selection of movies I’ve never heard of and 2 episodes per tv show offered. You can charge your phone and pay for snacks, water, blankets and headphones from your seat. All of this is a joke. Don’t bother calling in to cancel either because you will get a fat phone charge and though you click “2 for English”, they never actually speak English. As of June 2018 this is the most updated aircraft and it doesn’t have an option to pay for WiFi. Will never fly this airline again. If you’re flying to or from USA, American Airlines is more cost effective and better in every way.</review></record>

<review>I like this airline and find it a good value for the price.  I really enjoy flying the dreamliner aircraft and the comfort of their premium economy.  Wide seats with extra legroom and personal tvs make the longer routes much more tolerable although I wish they had more choices of shows/movies.  Unfortunately, like all airlines, they could do a better job of keeping you up to date on delays.  How about periodic SMS messaging or something by the people in control instead of dumping it on the desk agents?  In general I find the desk agents very friendly and helpful.  The inflight attendants just courteous but not particularly friendly.< /review>< Time>

Poor experience with Norwegian. Their online check in didn't work on my Apple iPhone, didn't work on my Android tablet, didn't work on my MacBook Pro with Chrome or Safari. Also, don't upgrade to their $50 meal option unless you're happy with $5 of poor quality food.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Good airline. Who whines that it is bad, fly on the Russian “victory” and the Norwegian will be a super carrier. There is stable wi-fi throughout the flight, there is not much food, but it is tasty.

(Original)
Хорошая авиакомпания. Кто ноет о том,что она плохая,на российской "победе" пролетите и norwegian окажется супер перевозчиком. На всём протяжении полета есть стабильный wi-fi, еды не много,но она вкусная.<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Review of Norwegian Airlines.

Since I like to write reviews about absolutely everything: what I buy, what services I use, about restaurants and cafes, about airlines and so on, and today I am a level 7 guide to Google. This means 700 thousand views of my photos on reviews and 150 thousand views of my recommendations - today I want to share my review about Norwegian Airlines. Take note of who you need✅

✈️ The flight from London to Los Angeles took just over 11 hours. Flew a business.

Some points that I would like to note:

👜🧳 With a business, you can take 15 kg of hand luggage in total (bag + carry-on suitcase).
💼💼 You can hand over 2 suitcases of 20 kg each and subsequent ones for a fee.
🍝 The lounge area (business lounge) was far from the gate. Not very comfortable. There you can eat breakfast and drink. Included in the ticket price.
💺Very comfortable seats.
🦵 A lot of space in general and especially legroom. More than some other business airlines that I flew before.
💶 Relatively not expensive tickets.
🍲 Delicious food. Cod with potatoes in a white sauce. Salad with goat cheese and a very, very tasty dessert. It was a dinner. For breakfast, turkey and beetroot salad and pickled beef were served.
🥗 Whoever wanted to eat during the break could buy a tasty snack: salad, sandwich, rice noodles, or a fruit plate for a small fee.
🍷☕️ Drinks at any time and in any quantity including wine (white or red), beer, juices, tea, coffee. Only the most refined and unique alcoholic drinks were available for a fee.

In general, I really liked it. I recommend 👍

Отзыв о Норвежских авиалиниях.

Так как я люблю писать отзывы абсолютно о всем: что покупаю, какими услугами пользуюсь, о ресторанах и кафе, об авиакомпаниях и так далее и на сегодняшний день я гид 7 уровня в Гугл. Это значит 700 тысяч просмотров моих фотографий по отзывам и 150 тысяч просмотров моих рекомендаций - то сегодня я хочу поделиться своим отзывом об авиакомпании Норвежских авиалиний. Берите кому надо себе на заметку✅

✈️Полет с Лондона в Лос Анджелес занимал чуть более 11 часов. Летела бизнесом.

Некоторве моменты, которые хотелось отметить:

👜🧳 С собой в бизнес можно брать 15 кг ручной клади в совокупности (сумка+ ручной чемодан).
💼💼 В багаж можно сдать 2 чемодана по 20 кг и последующие за отдельную плату.
🍝 Лаундж зона (зона отдыха для бизнеса) находилась далеко от гейта. Не очень удобно. Там можно съесть завтрак и выпить напитки. Включено в цену билета.
💺Очень комфортные сиденья.
🦵Очень много места вообщем и особенно места для ног. Больше чем в некоторых других авиалиниях бизнеса, которыми я летала ранее.
💶 Относительно не дорогие билеты.
🍲 Вкусная еда. Треска с картофелем в белом соусе. Салат с козьем сыром и очень, очень вкусный десерт. Это был ужин. На завтрак подавали индюшатину с салатом со свеклы и маринованную говядину.
🥗 Кто хотел кушать в перерыве мог купить себе вкусный снек: салат, сэндвич, рисовую лапшу, или фруктовую тарелку за небольшую плату.
🍷☕️ Напитки в любое время и в любом количестве включая вино (белое или красное), пиво, соки, чай, кофе. Только самые изысканные и уникальные алкогольные напитки были за отдельную плату.

В целом мне очень понравилось. Рекомендую 👍< /review>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend! Little professionalism
Outward flight managed by another company, quite poor with a plane that looked like a bus, return flight with a 2-hour timetable (one on the day of the restart) and before that they even changed the return airport .. chaotic to say the least.

(Original)
Non consiglio! Poca professionalità
Volo di andata gestito da un’altra compagnia abbastanza scadente con un aereo che sembrava un autobus, volo di ritorno con orario spostato per ben 2 volte (una proprio il giorno della ripartenza) e prima ancora hanno cambiato anche l’aeroporto del ritorno.. a dir poco caotici .<//review>

<rate>4<//rate><review>(Translated by Google) Flight from Kastrup to Los Angeles with Norwegian's. We flew on the Lowfare class and the cheap price considering, we got a great service. No blankets were included - and the food (which was good) had to be purchased. The legroom was a little cramped - so if you are tall, then you should consider booking emergency seats or going up in price to Lowfare + or Premium.

(Original)
Flyvetur fra Kastrup til Los Angeles med Norwegian’s. Vi fløj på Lowfare klasse og den billige pris taget i betragtning, så fik vi en god service. Der var ikke inkluderet tæpper - og maden (som var god) skulle tilkøbes. Benpladsen var lidt trang - så er man høj, så bør det overvejes at booke nødpladser eller at gå op i pris til Lowfare+ eller Premium.</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I had a flight from Cologne to Malaga and back. The punctuality for outward and return flights is absolutely positive. Drinks and food must be purchased on the plane. I think the stewardesses are terrible. Not international English seems to be a foreign word here too, or they deliberately ignore it !? We were six people and had a complete row and my daughter's seat hung down a rail (see photo) when I asked whether that would be dangerous, the answer was no ....... so with all understanding as ignorant as this crew was, just awful.

(Original)
Ich hatte einen Flug von Köln nach Malaga und retour. Absolut positiv ist die Pünktlichkeit bei Hin und Rückflug. Getränke und Essen müssen im Flugzeug käuflich erworben werden. Schrecklich fände ich die Stewardessen sehr unfreundlich nicht international auch hier scheint Englisch ein Fremdwort zu sein oder sie ignorieren es Absichtlich !?  Wir waren sechs Person und hatten eine komplette Reihe und der Platz meiner Tochter hing eine Schiene runter (siehe Foto) auf meine Frage hin ob das nicht gefährlich wäre war nur nein die Antwort.......also bei allem Verständnis so ignorant wie diese Crew war, einfach schrecklich.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Airline offering flights to Europe (Paris, London, Madrid, etc.). The comfort on board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is excellent: humidified air, lower cabin altitude, larger windows, latest generation interior light, etc. The food offered, especially in Premium, is of very good quality.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad attention to the passenger. In their policies they say that on any long flight you include at least the food and when you are already on the flight they tell you that in the basic modality no! And you have to pay exorbitant prices apart for a sandwich or a drink !! Your hostesses treat you fatally and in general they do not have a good predisposition to help the passenger! The fact of having to pay even for a glass of water on a commercial flight of 11 hours had not happened to me in life with other companies, even if I traveled with the basic fare! Anyway, if in the future I can avoid flying with them I will do it!

(Original)
Pésima atención al pasajero. En sus políticas ponen que en cualquier vuelo de larga duración te incluye por lo menos la comida y cuando estas ya en el vuelo te dicen que en la modalidad básica no! Y que tienes que pagar precios desorbitados aparte por un sándwich o una bebida!! Sus azafatas te tratan fatal y en general no tienen una buena predisposición ayudar al pasajero! Lo de tener que pagar hasta para un vaso de agua en un vuelo comercial de 11 horas no me había pasado en la vida con otras compañías,ni aunque viajase con la tarifa básica! En fin, si en futuro puedo evitar volar con ellos lo haré!<//Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Bad service, I had to catch a flight with this line from Amsterdam to Stockholm, I arrived 5 hours in advance of the flight and nobody knew how to give me information, they sent me to train in different rows, they charged me my extra luggage, the amount of 80 euros , when the flight had already closed and they didn't want to reimburse me or help me get a new flight so as not to lose my connection. They gave me no solution and just laughed at me. The workers of this line were rude at the Amsterdam airport Schipol.

(Original)
Pésimo servicio, me tocaba agarrar un vuelo con esta línea de Ámsterdam a Estocolmo, llegué con 5 horas de anticipación al vuelo y nadie me supo dar información, me mandaban a formarme a diferentes filas, me cobraron mi equipaje extra, la cantidad de 80 euros, cuando ya se había cerrado el vuelo y no quisieron reembolsarme o ayudarme a conseguir un nuevo vuelo para no perder mi conexión. No me dieron ninguna solución y solo se reían de mi. Fueron groseros los trabajadores de esta línea en el aeropuerto de Ámsterdam schipol.</text>

(Translated by Google) The worst airline I have ever been on.
My trip was from Barcelona-Los Angeles 11 hours direct. I paid my ticket, but they never notified me that snacks, drinks, headphones were not included. As I start my journey, I realize that you have to buy everything from water to headphones. these conditions are unacceptable for such a long and direct flight.
Tips if you choose this airline to travel. take your things.

(Translated by Google) Extremely quickly expanding cheap airline. Service similar to Ryanair and Easyjet. Norwegian also flies on long-haul flights e.g. to USA and Asia (including Thailand)

Currently (1st quarter 2018) the airline is in economic turmoil, due to the rapid expansion, the cash flow is somewhat "stressed" over the winter season ;-)

You have to pay extra for everything.

Only new aircraft (Boeing 737 and Boeing 787) are used

(Original)
Extrem schnell espandierende Billig-Airline. Vom Service ähnlich wie Ryanair und Easyjet. Norwegian fliegt aber auch auf der Langstrecke z.B. nach USA und Asien (u.a. Thailand)

Aktuell (1. Quartal 2018) ist die Airline in wirtschaftlichen Turbulenzen, aufgrund der schnellen Expansion ist der Cash-Flow über die Wintersaison etwas "strapaziert" ;-)

Es muss für alles extra gezahlt werden.

Es wird ausschließlich neues Fluggerät (Boeing 737 und Boeing 787) verwendet< /review>

Everytime I go here, everyone is extremely welcoming. I never have had a difficult time finding something because they are so attentive and willing to help. I recently have been using their delivery service and it is the best! They helped me find the best prices and they delivered the same day when I ordered my cat food at 1230. I won't go anywhere else!< /Text>

A locally owned store with an excellent variety of products for all of your pet needs. Personally, I prefer their products and prices to that of big box pet stores. If you're looking to get into rasing chickens, they have everything you need for that too, including the chickens. They also have a variety of products for other livestock too. They have a membership program, which is free to join and saves you money.</text>

We got a puppy about 6 months ago and were complete novices.  We went here initially to get inoculation shots for the pup (a huge plus for this place, btw), and assumed it mostly had supplies for horses, cows chickens etc... as the name seems to imply. We were quite mistaken. This place has everything your dog might need.  There is a friendly staff who seem like knowledgable neighbors rather than people who just need a job (like many pet stores in my experience). I highly recommend Western Farm Center.<//review>

If you have a pet, this is definitely the place to go for *all* of your pet stuff. I've been a customer since 1988. I (and my kids) have had dogs, cats, birds, lizards, snakes, etc., and I have never been disappointed when looking for any of the food or paraphernalia required to maintain the health and happiness of any of our non-human family members.
The thing I like best about this place is not the array of merchandise or the reasonable prices; it's the feel. It's not like a department store with a pet stuff aisle. This is a farm center. It smells like hay and animals. The staff mostly seem like they honest to God can't think of anything more important to do at the moment than help you find your pet stuff. Into chickens and looking for some hatchlings? Right over there. Need some crickets for your lizard? This young man will get right on that.
This is the sort of place that will remind you why online shopping is not always the best choice. Try it, you'll like it.< /Text>

If you need anything from yard to farm this is the place to get it. You can't beat the service and location of Western farm, tell them what you need and they will bring it to your vehicle. They have always done this even before SIP.  Great place to find gifts as well, who wouldn't love a new bird feeder.<//review>

<text>First impressions are everything in business. When you call a place to inquire about inventory or questions on what they offer, it truly hurts the business to have someone answer the phone and them respond like you are inconveniencing them.  I received short answers, "mmm-hmmm's" and a lack of care for a potential client. Taking my business elsewhere.< /text>< pictures>

I went in looking for parakeet pellets and maybe a toy or two. I was surprised and pleased with their stock, and I spent a good hour browsing and picking out cage refurbishments. My little budgie pal is thrilled with her new "living room"! And she also loves the pellets!
The rest of the store looks to be well stocked; it's a huge building and I think it has maybe everything!!</Review>

Their staff is friendly, answers questions and will help you choose the right product for your animals.

<Text>Came in to buy bulk of feed for the farm I work at and all of the employee's seemed to be friendly and greeted me with a hello and a smile although when they pointed me over to the store manager to help me with my list of feed John the store manager barley greeted me and had a lot of attitude now for being a store manager you would think he would lead by example, seemed to be in a rush and was completely rude about helping me out. Not looking forward to coming back if he's gonna be there. Terrible customer service.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

My go to shop for all my kitty needs. Less expensive than the big box chains, and you're supporting a local business!! Also, they always offer to help you out to your car with your purchase. Old school values, and everyone there has been a long time employee( low turnover), and highly knowledgeable.<//Review>

I LOVE Western Farms. They've got a great selection, lots of people to assist you, the prices are great and it truly a locally owned & managed business. I understand many franchises are locally owned & operated, but for me, it's not the same. Even after their remodel its still Western Farms. They didn't go too far with it. Thanks for being here.<//Review>

Western Farm Center, primarily, is the best local Food Emporium for our 4 legged friends. Including refrigerated meats for the carnivores. They also have great food for the 4 legged vegetarians and vegans. 4.5 stars to Western Farm Center for having very good support gear including skin toners, pest infestation removal products, meds, shampoos, leashes, etc for the 4 leggeds. They also have great support items for the aviary family.  And don't forget to delight yourself by buying a colorful wind movable sculpture for the front yard. They're located at the edge of the parking lot.</Text>

This has been one of my favorite pet supply stores for over two decades. I have come here consistently to get mice to feed my snakes. When I got rid of my snakes I really missed the friendly staff. I went back yesterday just to check in on food prices for my new kitten and was pleasantly surprised that not much has changed except for the layout of the store. Western Farms is a great location</Review>

<Review>A great local pet and farm store. I have been going here since I bought chicks from then a couple of years ago. The people are very friendly and knowledgeable. They also have a great selection of products for your household pets, including many food options that aren't available in big pet stores.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Unique place for people and pets. Found neat toys for cats and dogs. My daughter is especially fond of the bunnies,birds, and other little creatures. Really like this place. Everyone there is very helpful. I'm a fan for the last 25 years.<//Review>

<Review>Western Farm is an oasis of rural life in town. Hay, grain, waterers, feeders, chicken coops, rabbits, chickens, doves, enclosures, tack, tools, bedding, all manner of pet food/supplies, medicines, vet clinics, some seeds/gardening, more. The list is long. Bulletin board, friendly, knowledgeable staff own livestock/pets themselves, sturdy men load for you, always busy. A great place to visit, even as a tourist. Get a taste of rural life.</Review><response>None< /response><Date>1546816833672< /Date>< UserId.>

This place is super clean, organized and the staff is always super helpful. The customer service is top notch. They always answer my questions and make sure I get the info I needed. The staff helped me figure out what products are best for my chickens in the different stages they are in. They have a very wide variety of feed, toys, products, etc. Thank you guys for being awesome! I will not go anywhere else, ever, for my animal feed and supplies.</Text>

<Review>We had a great experience here. My cat has a severe urinary infection, and has struggled with the complications. We’ve been trying to figure out what food to get him, but were at a loss.

The employee who helped us was named Lexi, and she was a life saver. She advised us not to buy food with poultry in it (as that isn’t good for UTIs) and recommended a wet & dry food. She repeatedly said that if our cat didn’t like the food, we could return it for a full refund. She was clearly an expert, and it was reassuring to get such good advice.<//Review>< Pics>

Fantastic service and wonderful selection of high quality products for reasonable prices. They do a great job here. They also offer on-site contracted vet vaccine and other services on the weekends, and special promotions regularly. Great place to buy supplies for livestock, horses, birds, small animals, cats and dogs!! :-D</review>

This is my favorite local pet store. There is plenty of parking available in their lot. The location is a bit tucked back behind railroad square. They have great service and the staff are always friendly. It can be a bit more expensive vs other locations, but it's worth it.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I live within the area.. Don't get me wrong. We come here to buy our monthly supply of Taste of the wild (best price in town) and we get our dog vaccinations here!
Though, I've come to realize some of the employees are not who they seem.. My partner walked in and got told (by a manager) we cannot park in free parking on the corner of west 8th and Donahue! And that the parking is [for them to park] and we need to move up! What with the parking laws in California I'm perfectly within MY rights to be here.
And Kevin (who I thought was lovely) until one morning I told him good morning and now I get greeted with "What are you staring at?" I've come to the realization I did nothing to him to deserve such a vile response not even in a joking way.
These couple examples are what I've been experiencing every time we come in now..
Such hatred... So I've removed my 5 star rating and I'll be posting this review on Yelp aswell.

GOODMORNING and hope you get treated fairly.<//Review>< Pics>

I really like this place. Pretty much any pet supply you might want to buy. Do you want to start keeping chickens? This place will fix you up. Rabbits, same. Want feed? No problem. They host low cost vet clinics on Sundays. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff.<//review>

The friendliest staff of people when you have questions about ANYTHING in the store.  The people working there actually have livestock, horses and birds.  I've been a gainful customer for many years even though there is another place less than a mile from my home.
Excellent as far as I'm concerned!!<//Text>

They have plenty of staff to answer questions, take care of your transaction, and bring the bags of whatever you need right to your car. They will also give you tips on your purchase. They are the best!< /Text>

I'd you take care of animals then Western Farm is the place.  Pets to Livestock, even bee keeping.  Try it ...they are nice people.  Drive in, order, pay, and they load your vehicle.<//Review>

Everyone here is rude! I pulled up infront like they always tell me to do so they can load my bear bricks, then get  rudely told im not allowed to do that, literally after I get told to do that so its easier!? Then I go to help load up my car so it goes faster because they like to load one at a time instead of two because you know that makes sense (NOT) and the dude goes "NO YOU CANT HELP STEP BACK YOUNG LADY" like why because im a woman I wanna know why, I already paid your standing right there its not like im gunna steal! And this guy is literally slamming them down in my car, just a bad experience, they dont even keep the animals cages clean always smells like sewage over there, feel so bad for the livestock not to mention way over priced, I dont think i'll be going back and will tell my family not to either we will go to tractor supply from now on and will get my chicken food there as well.<//Text>

This is one of the first places I loved 33 years ago when I moved to Santa Rosa.  It is a true farm store and  community gathering place.  You can get your critters and things you need to keep them healthy and happy even you are not going to eat them at some point LOL.</Text>

<Review>This is a great place if you have a dog or a cat, even chickens but if you are looking for a "farm" store look elsewhere. Today I needed some torula yeast tablets and after being passed on to an uninspiring young man I was very disappointed. The young man's reaction was initially "what???" Afetr which he "went to look" returning shortly saying "I don't think so, I asked one of the other guys and they've never heard of them so I guess there's no such thing!" Torula yeast tablets are used in olive fruit fly traps and considering the number of olives grown in our are a farm store should stock them. A farm store this is not!</Review>< pictures>

It's a good place, but for the love of God, get  some sort of queue system for your customers!  I hate the whole,  "Okay, who's next," nonsense every time there's more than one person waiting to get wrung up.< /Review>

This is the first place I go for everything to do with my parrots.  There are a lot of things I've bought that I didn't expect to get for myself, like stainless bowls, brooms, etc.  The employees are always nice and there are always plenty to help you out.<//Text>

And then they told us to call them on Wednesday. We called and they said they didn't have enough cages for the rabbits. So we asked if we could have the breeders info and they said no. They do not try to help u at all<//review><Name>Taiten Kolpin< /Name></record>
