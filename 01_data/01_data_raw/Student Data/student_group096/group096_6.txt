I came in to apply for a loan and although i did not qualify i would still recommend them to anyone in need of a loan. Gus was polite, helpful and informative. i was greeted the second i walked in through the door, and i was helped right away. Thank you for your kindness buddy, i appreciated the quality i received.<//review>

These guys are great. I came in for a loan and Rody, the assistant manager helped me out. There was no hassle or any extras sprung on me and they all had amazing customer service. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and everything was great. Thank you Rody and your team for assisting me</review>

I had white spots on my teeth for most of my life caused by a childhood illness. This made me smile less as I was self-conscious about the situation. I had been quoted $10-15K for veneers to fix the problem. Then, I found Dr. Defaii. Because of his depth of experience, he was able to correct the condition in one visit for a fraction of the cost through the use of bonding techniques. Due to lack of prerequisite training and necessary aesthetic talent, this is a cosmetic dentistry skill that few dentist today possess<//text>

I have been going to San Jose Smile Center for many years now with Dr. Deffaii as my primary dentist.  Dr. Deffaii is one of the nicest and caring people you'll ever meet, not to mention extremely diligent and thorough when it comes to dentistry.

I cannot be more happy of my results from San Jose Smile Center. In the past, I was never fully happy of my smile. As an adult I’ve tried many methods to try to correct the little gaps that seem big to me. A lot of previous doctors turned me away saying my desired look could not be achieved so I was left with dealing with what I thought to be an less than perfect smile.

I wasn’t until I met Dr. Defaii that I felt that my request was achievable. His knowledge and passion for results really shown in each visit and every time I left the office I felt cared for.  His staff is amazing and you can tell they all lead with grace and compassion. Dr. Defaii was able to fill my gaps and gave me the smile I’ve always wanted. I’m so grateful for him and his staff. I cried for days after because the insecurities behind my smile were gone. I highly recommend San Jose Smile Center for all your dental needs.</Text>

But ever since I started visiting Dr.Defaii, my fears are practically gone, he is clearly a very experienced dentist that truly cares about wellbeing and comfort of his patients. My first visit was for extraction of a very inflamed and painful tooth, I was shaking only from the thought of touching the tooth at all, but Dr. Defaii offered me gas sedation that was very affordable and truly made a huge difference for me, besides, he gave me a numbing shot that was absolutely painless and I was truly shocked by how fast and officiant the procedure went.  I couldn’t be more happy with my dental visits and I am very relieved to finally find a dentist that I trust.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Typically I'm not one to write reviews, however the service I've received here may help people who are just like. To begin, I'm very timid when it comes to any sort of dental work, from the buzzing drill to the shot. However, Dr. Defaii and his assistant precilla we on some next level treatment/service. It doesn't feel like you're walking into a regular dentist office it feels like you're going to somebody's house because of how hospitable they are, constantly asking if you're doing fine or if you need anything. The procedure I had done was deep cleaning, and a filling, the whole process was just as amazing, Dr. Defaii keeps you informed as to what is going on throughout and it makes the service so much more comforting. I'm not sure if this will make sense to some people but there are some dentist out there with rough hands when they're in there doing what they're doing, that is not the case here, Dr. Defaii is super gentle. My only regret was not finding this office sooner but I'm glad I have.<//Review>

Great dentist and staff. Dr Defaii makes sure you're comfortable during any procedure and aware of everything he's doing. He always follows up with personal phone calls to checkup on you and make sure you're experiencing no pain or complications. Highly recommended!<//Review>

Honesty is very important to me, that's what I look for first and foremost when I'm looking for services especially my health and dental care. Last week I went in with pain and I had to go on a trip the next day, I got a long procedure that I needed to be done in a day. They worked fast and painlessly and it was over before I knew it.

<text>10/10 Dr. Defaii is AMAZING and GENTLE!

After getting kicked off my parent’s insurance at 26 and moving to a different city, I didn’t have the energy to find a good dentist around me. I also was extremely terrified of the dentist due to past trauma from my previous dentists as a child. After 7 years of not going to the dentist, I could see that my oral health was horrible, and my teeth needed some love ASAP. I found Dr. Defaii from Opencare as his office was close to my house.

My first appointment was on March 3rd, 2020. I was extremely nervous to even be there, but I was proud that I was being proactive about my dental health.  Upon arriving to the dental office, I thought the location was easy to find and there was ample parking. The first appointment went well, and I was able to receive a check up of my whole mouth including x-rays. Dr. Defaii is very patient, he tells you exactly what he is doing so there’s no surprises, he is GENTLE and doesn’t have a heavy hand with tools in your mouth, and he the utmost caring. During the procedure, he told me that I was doing a great job and this really helped me feel less anxious. Dr. Defaii personally called me after my appointment to see how I was doing!! No doctor has ever done this – this is what sets Dr. Defaii apart from any other dentist. He truly cares about his patients and always wants you to feel comfortable during and after any appointment.

My second appointment was to do a deep cleaning. I needed this badly due to the calcium buildup (tartar) in my inner mouth. Due to my high anxiety, Cassie, the amazing receptionist, offered me oral sedation and laughing gas. I had my reservations about both as I have never used either in my life. However, I’m SO glad that I chose to have the oral sedation as well as the laughing gas. My experience from this second appointment reassured me that Dr. Defaii is a great dentist, and my anxiety from my previous dentist should be left at the door.

My third, fourth, and fifth appointments were during the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, I was eager to know what kinds of precautions that this dental office would be taking. As soon as I arrived in the parking lot, I was told to call them to make sure that I got the OK to come into the reception area (in case there were other patients there). I needed to fill out COVID forms as well as my temperature taken. The pens that I used when filling out the forms were then sanitized after I used them, and my credit card was sanitized after payment (I thought this was a very nice gesture of them). All the dental rooms had air purifiers and the doors were closed so no airborne particles could enter. They also gave me an oral rinse to kill any bacteria, if any. After any procedures were finished, a warm, moist, individually wrapped towelette was given to me to wipe my face.

From 100% anxiety to go to the dentist and not going in 7 years to 100% would go see Dr. Defaii tomorrow if he had any openings. I think he’s such a great dentist and I’m so thankful of his work. My teeth haven’t looked this good since I was a kid and it’s given me a lot of confidence in my smile. If you’re hesitant to go to the dentist and have anxiety like I do, give Dr. Defaii and try because he changed my whole perspective about going to the dentist. Thank you Dr. Defaii and team!<//text><Date>1595632774318< /Date></record>

<Review>First teeth cleaning done by the dentist was completed fast but well. Second cleaning of all the teeth on my upper jaw, which started with an injection of Novocaine, was completed in less than 15 min. Same procedure was performed by the same dentist. However, this time it was very bad. Never had a worse cleaning!< /Review>< Pics>

Give each patient enough and necessary time, so that bad situations do not happen.  Not running from patient to patient at the same time.  It pays very well to receive the best and quality treatment.  Don't be reckless.

I had some extractions and my experience was terrible.  The "Doctor"  Defaii left a piece of the tooth that came out after two weeks from the extraction.  I had the pains for almost several weeks.  And another unpleasant thing I noticed about him was that he takes care of several patients at the same time and doesn't change his gloves.  Really very negligent.

Dr. Defaii must have been my dentist for the last 20 years, as far back as I can remember, and he’s always been amazing. I even still drive an hour to see him.

Every time I visit him it is actually a pleasant experience. He’s a great guy in general, but also goes above and beyond to make sure you’re comfortable during any procedure.

He legitimately cares about his patients and is always giving me the latest advice on how to keep my entire mouth healthy and clean.<//Text>

<text>Howard is a very detailed oriented dentist with exceptional customer service. I called up to book an appointment and he agreed to see me on the same day. He checked out every nooks and crannies. He cleaned my teeth twice, and then again to make sure it’s really clean. I have yet to meet a dentist who cares so much about his work. We need that type of person for this job.
He is also very accommodating with scheduling. But if you come late in the afternoon, you might need to come back to complete the service.
My advice:try to schedule in the morning. More time for him to take care of your teeth. 90% of other dentist  will charge you twice as much as Howard.  Yet their service is no where compatible to Howard’s.
He also educates me about proper flossing.
He’s a dentist I can trust.<//text>< Pics>

Dr. Defaii is my favorite dentist ever. He has a kind and lighthearted demeanor and makes the patient feel really cared for. He also takes pride in his beautiful work. I've been seeing him since I moved to the area in 2013 and would recommend him to anyone, including anyone with anxiety or sensitivity, because he offers drugs, gas, cozy blankets, etc. if you need them. His staff is also very competent and kind. His office manager is great at letting you know what's covered and what your out-of-pocket expenses will be before you agree to anything.</text>

Had the second part of my deep cleaning today and was pleased with not only how quick and painless it was, but how white and literally-shiny my teeth now are! All the staff that I've interacted with are friendly, professional and attentive to your needs, and the service is remarkably prompt as I was in and out in about thirty minutes today.</Review>

<Review>Dr Defaii is probably the best dentist in the world. So if you live in San Jose, and want to feel relaxed, not embarrassed, and need help to get your mouth back on track, or a great routine dentist that will keep your smile going the distance, this is the place to go.

I've been anti-dentist too long, and really needed help getting my mouth back into a healthy state. A decade of putting off a visit, and "ya got problems" is pretty much how my mouth was.

Dr Defaii and staff, are amazingly warm, and responsive. I've enjoyed leaving every visit. The time is taken to ensure you feel comfortable, and are ready to rock and roll, then Dr Defaii does his magic. He makes going to the dentist feel effortless, and does his art with such skill and precision that my mouth hasn't felt this great in YEARS.

I'm continually excited to keep up on the repairs, with the amazing work that is done at San Jose Smile Center. I can't recommend this dental practice enough.

Teeth are an important part of life, and one that we all take for granted too long until issues arise. Take care of those issues today before they become huge problems, and have Dr Defaii take care of you by creating and applying an amazing treatment plan.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Best dentist in the bay area!! I've been to a lot of dentists and this one is far above the rest in the bay area. Dr. Defaii works with you, not only with your teeth but with something else our budget. I work in customer service and as a customer I feel loved and care for. At the San jose smile center, you leave feeling you spent your hard working money on something that's going to last. How can you not leave with a smile feeling better and your teeth looking beautiful. If your looking for a new dentist stop, come to Dr. Defaii he will take care of you and help you and he will go at your pace. Best dentist in the bay area hands down.< /Text>

<text>I hadn’t been to the dentist in YEARS... Shamfully... hahaha ... NeverTheLess I built up the courage and conviction to go haha... From beginning to end even the process of setting up the appointment was soooo easy and friendly! The staff were alllll amazing and so helpful! It’s a very nice and comfortable and cozy environment. I felt less like a passing client or situation and more like a friend or family member. Doctor Dafaii was super friendly, accurate and REAL! Which I appreciate... He handle everything swiftly showing true compassion, understanding, know how and appreciation for me. Every situation was adjusted too and fixed asap and I had some complex things that needed to be addressed! I’ve never had a better dentist experience. Most importantly my teeth got better! And that’s the end result we are all looking for right? I give them a 7/5 stars and will continue to be happily in business with them 😊 Thank you Doctor Defaii and San Jose Smile Center Staff you guys are awesome!< /text>< Time>

I’ve always been mortified of dentist visits due to some dentists either lying about what’s actually wrong, or the neglect on if the pain was to much.

After having to go to Dr. Defai, he’s hands down the only dentist I would go to from here on out. He’s never rushing the work that needs to be done, pain is never an issue, and his work is flawless. I just got a root canal complete and you can’t even notice the crown at all!

If you’re looking for which dentist office might be the best fit for you, I would 100% recommend Dr. Defai!<//Text>

I've been going to Dr. Defaii for a long time. He is the best in the industry as far as I am concerned. He handles patients with extra care, explains everything well, gives patients choices when possible, very professional, and clean. He gets an A++ at his job.< /review>

I visited Dr. Defaii based on a couple of recommendations from my co-workers. Dr. Defaii did of great job of getting my teeth back in shape after a couple of years of neglect (no dentist visits). He does a good job of making sure your comfortable during any procedures and keeps you informed a what going on. (Yeah, I need to floss more!) Any way I'm now a happy regular at the smile center.</Text>

< Review>
I sincerely recommend Dr. Howard Defaii to all who are in need of dental work.

For more than 26 years, he has been taking care of my dental needs with the best care and result, making the generally painful procedures almost a pain free and tolerating experience.

After each procedure, he personally always calls me to make sure that there is no discomfort or any problem.

His assistants and technicians are very skilled, qualified, friendly and accommodating.

In my opinion, Dr. Defaii is the most knowledgeable, proficient and reliable dentist.

My husband started going to Dr. Defaii for several procedures about a month ago.  He seemed to like the office, so I decided to go for a cleaning and to deal with a hurting tooth. Everyone in the office is extremely friendly with a family feel, as though they are welcoming you into their family. I know it sounds cliche, but they are really nice. Also, they were running early, so they had given me a call before my appointment time and told me to come in as soon as I wanted to, which I appreciated. Dr. Defaii was very welcoming and really seemed to enjoy helping and not just throw on extra stuff for the money. He is also very accommodating to nervous patients.  Also, after the initial visit of just looking at my teeth, they printed out a list of all the things that need to be done and how much it will all eventually cost.  I really liked that they did this up front so that you can have an idea of what to expect.  It was a good visit, and I think my family will stick with this office!!!<//text>

<Text>This is the first time I have been to the dentist in years, I am happy that I was recommended this place. Dr. Defaii and his team is a complete joy to deal with. They were all very professional and took great care of me.

Since I haven't got my teeth cleaned in a while, the doctor recommended me to get a deep clean to get rid of all the junk that had build up between my teeth and gum. During the procedure, Dr. Defaii would constantly asked how I am feeling and if I am comfortable or not. After my visit, the doctor would even called me on my phone to make sure that I am doing ok. That really shows that they really do care about their patient. I will be making regular visit to this place from now on. Extremely happy with the service.< /Text>< Pics>

Dr. Defaii has been my dentist and for all 5 of my children for 18 years. He has all the qualities of a superb dentist; clean, professional, personable, holds his staff to high standards, keeps up with the latest gadgets and innovations in dentistry.  He has lots of options for pain control for small children and gets the job done.  However, the quality that really stands out with Dr. Defaii is his extraordinary dedication to a person's teeth.  He educates the patient on how to maintain exceptionally high standards in dental hygiene.  He has a tidy, meticulous, fastidious personality and he focuses all that on your teeth!  Genetically, I was not blessed with great teeth, and Dr. Defaii seems to put himself under a little bit of stress to make them as perfect as he can.  I had a case of periodontal disease before I came to Dr. Defaii as a patient and I have not had a recurrence in 20 years.

Dr. Defaii also has absolutely the most exceptional Office Manager I have ever seen in my life to navigate all those insurance and payment headaches.  I never said anything but I always wondered, where Dr. Defaii found someone so intelligent, competent, professional, meticulous with numbers, insurance issues, personable and loyal!  After 17 years, I found out this was his wife.  They were always so professional, it didn't occur to me.  This lady could be a CEO somewhere, she is way overqualified to be an office manager but she has dedicated her life to solving your insurance, billing headaches and running an exceptional office along with Dr. Defaii!< /review>

From what I've read, tire plugs typically cost $5 or less, so the fact Snyder's charges $10 isn't great, but things tend to be more expensive in the mountains and I'm still happy with their service.  They were overloaded and missing two mechanics today before a storm is due, but one of their mechanics was still willing to take the time to talk to me on the phone about fixing a screw in my tire.  He recommended the cheaper plug over a patch from the inside because plugs tend to last longer in our weather.  Plugs are quick to install so he had the first one done in a few minutes.  While I waited, I noticed another tire also had a screw in it!  I rolled my car and the mechanic checked each tire and we found a third tire had a much older beat up screw in it.  All the screws were only half an inch so I'm not sure any were actually causing leaks yet, although I'd noticed the pressure on two of the tires was abnormally low a week ago.  He charged me $20 instead of $30 for all three and it was done in about 10 minutes.  He also filled every tire with air to 40psi which he said is recommended on our curvy roads.

Also, I often find tire places will try to upsell you on things like getting an alignment or replacing your tires because the treads are worn but there were none of those shenanigans here.

UPDATE: I came back two years later to ask if I should worry about a cut in the sidewall of a tire about 1" long and 1/4" deep.  They inspected it and said nothing to worry about.  I'm pleased they didn't try to sell me repairs I didn't need.< /text>

On April 2 I brought my car with neil  in back tire. They fixed tire fast and  right, but after that something goes wrong. Guy tried to put tire back and took wrong size wrench, and ruin one locknut. When I asked to change it, he answer - we don’t have it. So now I have to go to real mechanic to fix it.</text>

Veronica and Karina were amazing!! Great customer service and nothing but smiles.. I went to get a replacement for my glasses to find that they had Versace frames and other high end frames like Coach, Gucci , Prada and more! ! And they also take Care Credit.. I was soooooo blown away by how they fit on my face and the Amazing anti-glare on the lenses. If you want a pleasant experience and basically any name brand frames they got it! I love the quality of the frames and customer service. Not at all a long wait, I was serviced quickly.<//Text>

I have went to the same doctor for the past 15 years but decided to try something new. I am so happy I did because I had the best experience here!! The whole staff was absolutely amazing. Everyone there is so friendly and extremely helpful. I was helped by the lead optician Vanessa, she gave me the best service!! She took her time with me and made sure I was 100% satisfied with my selection. She was patient with me and offered her opinion on what looked best on me.  She even played with my daughter to keep her entertained while I decided on a pair. Vanessa worked with me as far as prices as well. She was so pleasant and made me feel so welcome. I had also been looking everywhere for a specific style for my daughter that was priced descent, but was having no luck. Vanessa made sure that before I left I also had the perfect pair for my little girl. My daughter was so excited!! I will definitely be coming here from here on out!! Thank you Vanessa and staff for a great experience.i highly recommend this office for both adults and children!!< /text>

<Review>Downtown optical has an extremely friendly and informative staff. Vanessa and Lloyd helped me with the visit. Drove about 3 hours just to come here and it’s was 1000% worth it. I’d refer anyone here. They helped me choose glasses for my 9 month old which most places don’t have.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDaqWbgLdk2r2T1GoPGY1R920W20AnufHVwfo8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8m0XzUKb6vZ69IucD4As_JcdDOZ15cS5M0ffC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

One of a kind staff.   If you ever need glasses then ask for Karina at the Downtown location!  She's Awesome.  Super attentive and very knowledgeable about choosing the right glasses to match your face shape.   Already bought 6 pairs this past year from Karina for my entire family.</text>

<review>By far "Eye Medical Center"  (1122 S. St., Fresno) is the best place to go for all your optical needs. Not only do the employees show great respect and kindness but everyone is always smiling and laughing. Finding a good doctor of any sort especially an optometrist with having to get your eyes checked, picking out frames, getting fitted, keeping your glasses in good condition and trying not to lose them can be challenging...that is why we are most lucky to have Lloyd as our optometrist. He is amazing and does his job with great dudilagiance. Lloyd makes our family feel comfortable and at ease. He remembers all our names and finds time to add in a few jokes to make our time more enjoyable. Lloyd's professionalism and kindness makes it easy for me and my family's return. I would highly recommend Eye Medical Center for all your optical needs and don't forget to ask for Lloyd.        The Cervantes family</review>< Pics>

My name is Lucy Reyes. I don’t usually do the internet so I’m getting help but I wanted to share my experience this morning. I got an eye exam at another facility and was lost on what to do with the prescription. I than found Eye Medical Center downtown and was greeted by Vanessa. She helped me to the frames I was eligible for and took her time to help me find the best fit. Very nice, helpful and made me feel so comfortable and most of all answered all my questions. I can’t wait for my new glasses to come in and I will for sure be back to see Vanessa and staff and will be letting all my friends and family know :)</Text>

The staff at Eye Medical center was very professional and kind. They answered all my questions and I had a lot! They also dealt very well with my frustrated 2 year old. I don’t know anyone who can be so professional, sweet and still get the job done well the way the staff did here. I would recommend this place for sure!</text>

I did not intend to go to this Eye Medical Center but the one on Herndon no longer takes my medical so I went to this Fresno Location. I went there on March 12 to get an order for prescription glasses. There was confusion about which frames were free. Vanessa told me that only  "that wall" over there was free. There are only 4 walls in a room. I assumed all of that ONE wall, she was talking about would be paid for from my insurance. I picked a frame from that one wall and it turned out to be 200 dollars for the frame. I believe there was a communication error there. After I paid, she told me it would take 1 month to get the glasses back, which is fine. March 30 rolled by and I lost my original glasses so I decided to check with Vanessa to see if the new glasses came in yet. Over the phone she told me, it had not and that it takes up to 2 months. WOW, confusing me more. I get it, it COVID times and everything is slow, but being told two separate times when you should expect to get your glasses is just well...frustrating. The next day comes. March 31 at 8:30 AM, I received a phone call from a gentleman that my glasses were ready. I went over there waiting at the receptionist, while Vanessa and Jeanette sit there gossiping. They finally noticed me and allowed me to come in. The frame they ordered for me were not the ones I picked out. I told them that and Vanessa made a rude comment. She said maybe I don't remember the frame I picked out. I brought over the correct frame in which they found that it had the wrong label. It was a mistake on their part, which is fine because everyone makes mistakes. They let me take the glasses with the wrong frame home in the meantime and said that it would take 2 months to get the correct ones back. I called back on April 14 to check on the correct glasses and they said they weren't ready yet. Again, the next day comes April 15th at 8:30 AM they called and said that my glasses were ready. Like do I have to remind them? I called back later to asked about the price of glasses because I was getting annoyed. Vanessa said that She supposedly showed me the base models? (not true) But that I chose to get the ones with no coverage from my insurance. So ok I asked for a manager and Vanessa said she will "park" me, whatever that means. SO I was on hold for a minute or two. I heard her pick up the phone and introduce herself all over again. I am like....um didn't you put me on park? Finally, got a manager on the phone. I spoke to Lloyd and told him everything. He understood and tried to make it up. But it's too late I am NOT returning. It was such a hassle. They made me like I was being pulled around, dumb, and worthless. I have been nothing but patient and nice to them. In my experience, I did not feel like they (not Lloyd) cared enough about people  who need glasses. I work in health care and go to college. I have never seen people (not Lloyd) so unprofessional. I dislike giving bad reviews, but this is one I can't ignore or believe.<//Review>

<Text>We had 1.15 hours drive... Arrived 10 minutes late to our appointment due to traffic and standing in wrong line. Receptionist had no sympathy for our reason to be a little late and cancelled my 2 year old daughters appointment.. she was not helpful whatsoever. She was not professional, didn’t seem to care about the patients eye health and was not even dressed professional at all (Victoria Secret) shirt for a doctors office, really!! So unprofessional! I will not be returning to this office!< /Text></record>

I really appreciate that the staff is always very friendly and kind. I have been going to this eye clinic for quite some time now and have never had any issues so I don't think it's fair that people give them such low scores. I hope my review helps. Also the staff in the area where you're fitted for glasses  is the very best in Fresno they are very nice and honest and they don't force you to get extra add ons but they do explain all options.<//review>

<text>Horrible!!!! The worst wait times ever. The appt at 10:30, and had me wait in the car for an hour and a half, went inside to ask why it was taking so long, and they said they normally have a wait time of about 3 to 4 hrs!!!!! I wish they would have told me when I scheduled the appt. If you are able to, schedule elsewhere.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This place is great, everyone from receptionist to Doctor is great!! Very friendly, great with children and young adults.. Would recommend to everyone. My only complaint was wait time even with an appointment.  Had a 9:15 am appointment didn't get out till 12pm. It is a very busy office.<//Review>

< Review>
It took a while to get an appointment. But everyone was so helpful & nice from the doctor, nurse and office staff. It has been a long time since I have been in any type of doctor office where I didn't have to wait excessive times. Very pleased with our visit here!<//Review>

<Review>I had a rotten experience; waited over two hours to see the doctor and was told there was still another patient in front of me; left the office a half-hour later much annoyed and drove home; three hours wasted; now have a return appointment but not for a month and my eyes are really troubling me; am beginning to question EMC's fundamental competence, especially that of Dr. Sakauye.</Review>< Time>

<Name>Nikki Patricio<//Name><Time>1524806067353< /Time><Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Waiting 3 hours in any doctor’s office without an explanation or a heads up that the doctor was running behind, seems absurd.  When I asked how much longer it was going to be after two hours, and was given the answer “that the doctor is very thorough,” seems quite unfair.  Once in, I received excellent care and was out fairly quickly.  I do agree that the doctor is very thorough, but the staff needs to inform patients of delays and be more sensitive to patients who may have conflicting schedules.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I really appreciate that the staff is always very friendly and kind. I have been going to this eye clinic for quite some time now and have never had any issues so I don't think it's fair that people give them such low scores. I hope my review helps. Also the staff in the area where you're fitted for glasses  is the very best in Fresno they are very nice and honest and they don't force you to get extra add ons but they do explain all options.< /Review>< userid>

< review>
We had 1.15 hours drive... Arrived 10 minutes late to our appointment due to traffic and standing in wrong line. Receptionist had no sympathy for our reason to be a little late and cancelled my 2 year old daughters appointment.. she was not helpful whatsoever. She was not professional, didn’t seem to care about the patients eye health and was not even dressed professional at all (Victoria Secret) shirt for a doctors office, really!! So unprofessional! I will not be returning to this office!</review>

This time around they get 5 stars but the first time they didnt get a review from me, my daughter first time ever and the Dr. made her feel so uncomfortable that I had to speak up for her she was very rude and inpatient. Now this time it was my son and I requested a different Dr. which was way better and professional.</review>

<text>To long of waiting time for scheduled appointments that were already made 5 to 6 months or even 1 month ahead of time. Totally unacceptable.

Line staff front desk & back office, need to grow up, need to stop acting like they are still in high school, always standing around iddly talking, laughing , gossiping about clients which ones they like or don't like, again unacceptable.
What these people don't understand if it weren't for the patients, they wouldn't have a job or paycheck.
PATIENTS pay thier paychecks.
Maybe this is something they should ponder, before continuing their high school behavior.

The doctors seem to be good, however, they are over whelmed taking on to many patients for eye surgery
( greed or not....hmmm?)where the patients who come in for follow ups & check ups have to wait 2/3 hrs. Rediculous.

These institutions are not the ERs like@ the hospitals, that is totally different.

The larger the medical groups, the more people have to wait & suffer the long wait times, no empathy from the young staff they hire.
The office managers try their best to maintain the facility ,line staff, & doctors. Unfortunately, the younger line staff do & act the way they want, SAD, unknown to them, it is not helping them mature into empathic adults.<//text><user_id>102559144892755066044<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80945e1947362759:0x438cc991c79dbcac< /gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1520877044179, 'text': 'We are sorry for your less than desired experience.

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Filled aggressively and painfully, I got cut in the process. It’s been barely a week since the service and the nails look outgrown; did not last long. After the filing the nails and hands were not cleaned, I had remaining debris on my nails for the rest of the day even after washing my hands frequently. On the bright side the design was decent.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Name>Artist Beware: Xaila<//Name><Text>Been coming here since January 2018. Nice place good prices nails actually LAST and they don't give you BS when you want nail designs.

The only downside is that when you make an appointment (and you NEED TO they are very busy) expect to wait up to 15-20 minutes after your appointment time to get in the chair. This is due to how busy they are and how dedicated they are to making nice nails that last.< /Text>< Rate>

Nhi got greedy, her work quality is no longer what I remember it being a fews years back. My nails only lasted one week. I scheduled to go in but she had me waiting 40 mins for her, which I thought was going to be worth it. Unfortunately she rushed on my nails which were done in less than 1 hour because she was working on three ladies at the same time. She had one pedi and one mani halfway done as she was working in my nails. Paid $53< /Text>

Nancy is amazing! Tonight she took another salon's bad work and made my nails EXACTLY how I wanted them to be! I'm only coming to LV Nails from now on and asking for Nancy. She was extremely detailed oriented and completely changed the shape and color of my nails (clear powder turned into to dark pink powder with white powder) and made sure she did it in a way that preserved my natural nails underneath! I've never been disappointed after coming to LV nails for manicures or pedicures. My photo does her work no justice they are even more beautiful in person. Great prices and great work! Highly recommend! Friendly, knowledgeable, and professional! I trusted them with my wedding day manicure and pedicure and I was absolutely thrilled with the results!</Text>

<review>From DC, here for a wedding. Google search nail shop near me... and this spot came up.
Now from the looks of it they are busy and appt are key although they took me as a walk in..waited about 10min. I did see people get turned away. The shop is popular.
Very quick, out in a hour..reg pedi, gel mani. No complaints.<//review>< user_id>

I had a quiet and kind woman who did an awesome job on my mani. Great service for only $25, I gave her a $15 tip. She also gave a mini hand massage after! Five stars!<//review>

<Text>Not happy...I had a gel french manicure for my sisters wedding, and just days later, it was already peeling up. I was told they would last for weeks.  At a week after having it done, they look horrible, and so much has peeled off.  I was visiting Oceanside from Colorado, or I would have gone back.  I wasn't even told how to take care of them, if there is special care needed.  She knew I never had them done before, because she had to explain what they were to me.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>My phone was lost/stolen. I had 740 still left on my phone payment. They were able to provide me with a promotion to pay half my phone and I pay the other half in order to speed up my upgrade process. The manger was really Chris, was extremely helpful and kind. He was also very knowledgeable about the phone devices and was able to compare different types of phone and their specs to give me the best value and type of phone I was looking for. Highly recommend going to this Verizon store.</Review>< Pics>

Came in this morning to get a replacement because of a bad speaker/earpiece. Chris the manager went above and beyond to assist me with  resolving my issue while at the same time assisting others as well as guiding his employees. Great service like that is hard to find these days. Thanks Chris !< /text>

< Review>
I was really pleased with my service at Verizon Madera.  I had no idea how to set up a grub hub account because of pending surgery in San Francisco.  Not even would my Credit Union in Madera help me.  A young man, Mr. Brandon Macias, at Verizon Madera took his time and carried me through the process.  I was so pleased with his patience and professionalism.  Hats Off to Verizon Madera and Hats Off to Brandon Macias for an excellent job!<//Review>

<Review>Customer service was great, BUT, was told we had to pay 100 dollars for accessories to even leave the store with our phone? Did so because my old phone was broken & thought it was policy. Called Verizon support tonight & apparently it is not Verizon Corporate policy, but since this location is an indirect store, they have different policies. 100 dollars for one screen protector & phone case is ridiculous.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1611076263864, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience with us, Kylie.\xa0If you would like to provide more details, do not hesitate contact our Customer Service team at 877-851-0649 or customerservice@cellularsales.com. -- Cellular Sales Customer Service'}</response><gmapID>0x80940be71a903ea9:0xfcfc216049c6a1a7<//gmapID></record>

My experience was really great with the manager Chris Fisher. I am totally pleased with the service I received. We had trouble paying the bill and over the phone with customer service and they couldn't solve the problem. Chris figured it out and got us all set up with a better plan at a lower price and set up our Auto pay so this never happens again.< /review>

<Text>My family and I decided to switch to Verizon From sprint and it was a long time coming. The customer service we received was amazing. We were helped by Brandon and we came in on a Monday to look around and he wasn’t pushy or “trying to make a sale” he was very helpful and straight forward. We made an appointment for the following Thursday and he was there and got us all set up and made the process very easy. This is a 3rd party store most places are now days don’t let that scare you. The level of professionalism I saw by Brandon and the entire staff was incredible. Definitely check them out if you’re looking to switch carriers or a new phone.<//Text>< userid>

<Review>Lucy was the absolute best! She stayed with me after hours since my phone took so long to transfer over and she was on top of everything and provided me with all the information that I needed. The best customer service and the nicest person. I got a great deal as well. Extremely intelligent and knew exactly what she was doing. Thanks again Lucy!! Highly recommend you seeing her if you need help.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I came in to exchange a phone that I had previously purchased and the manager made the process so simple and advised me of my options both monthly as well as the difference between phones. I'm so happy that the service at this location has gotten so much better since the last time I came in over a year ago. This is my favorite Verizon store and will definitely be recommending my friends and family to this store and to this staff!!!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Brittany and Jessica were so helpful!!! My husband and I both upgraded our phones and had a lot of questions on the process. Brittany was so patient and answered all of our questions and helped me back up my phone to the cloud just in case so I wouldn’t lose a thing! Jessica was also very helpful with questions about our account and helped me pick out a new charging station. Can’t recommend them enough!!< /review>

If you ever need the best customer service yet alone someone who goes above and beyond for you I suggest you go see Ozzy! He is hands down the best person I've ever experienced in any type of customer service!!! He is the best and Verizon is lucky to have an employee like him!!! Any company would benefit by having him as an employee! Thanks again Ozzy for the best experience ever!!!<//review>

I have never really liked these authorized retailers. They can't conduct Verizon business. This young kid Darren had me waste my time going into this facility to try and swap out my bad Verizon charger, but yet he couldn't even pull up my account. I've been a Verizon customer for over 15 years and I have never had issues pulling up my account. I had a good hunch that they wouldn't be able to help me but Darren insisted on me going in and that he can help. I was in a hurry and I didn't appreciate my time being wasted.

It's funny how this post has been up for two weeks, and I got no response from the owner. Yet they're so quick to respond to good reviews. Goes to show you how terrible the customer service is here. You're welcome. I need say no more.</text>

He went out of his way to make sure I could walk out the door and be functional with the phone. His pleasant manner and demeanor along with his knowledge make him a perfect ambassador for verizon.

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Verizon failed to post an automatic payment to my account.  While I was near the store I went in to reactivate my phone.
Carlos greeted me and inside of 20 minutes he had me up and running again.  He provided the most friendly and professional assistance I’ve seen.  I’ll definitely go back to him if another issue ever comes along.
Thanks Carlos !!<//text>< UserId.>

<gmap_id>0x80940be71a903ea9:0xfcfc216049c6a1a7<//gmap_id><Text>Do not come here to buy a new phone or start service. I would go to an actual Verizon corporate store, Best Buy, or even Costco. I would only come here to pay my bill if I absolutely had to. Since this is a Verizon "authorized retailer" they charge ridiculous fees. I have been a Verizon customer for the last 12 years and I was sad when the corporate store closed.

Anyway I went to add service for my daughter we decided to get prepaid service for her. Verizon had a great offer for prepaid too. It was double data and free Sim card and free activation. I called Verizon to clarify before I went in to the store because I already knew these "authorized retailer's" always charge fees.

Long story short they tried to charge me 90$. 40$ was their "activation fee" and 50$ was for the first month of service. But here where things got fishy, the employee said the fees have to be paid separately. He said I had to pay the 40$ first to "activate" the line then I would have to pay the 50$ for the first month of service. Luckily I did my research before hand and I called Verizon Corporate customer service and they said all I had to do was pay 50$ for first month service and that was all. The employee at the store was trying to purposely charge me fees he wasn't supposed to even going as far as charging me separately. Avoid this place unless you absolutely cannot.<//Text>< date>

Exceptional service from Chris Fisher, came in to do a much needed upgrade with some apprehension but he made it easy and took his time explaining everything and setting up my new iPhone XR. I am very happy I came to this location and got to work with Chris. He even helped all the other reps and a customer next to us while working with me but I never felt neglected. Side note they all look really nice in their shirts and ties.</Review>

Go to a real Verizon store, even if you have to go to Fresno. When you walk in their all on their phones until someone looks up to welcome you. Their big an a sale but not on explaining all their charges. Everything is rushed, like..."Hurry up and buy".< /review>

Awesome staff. Christopher & Jasmine were awesome: right as we entered we were greeted. No waiting, they were so great about helping us with accessories we purchased.
And believe me was thinking I’d have another bad experience like I did at the Verizon on w. Shaw a few days prior. Worse experience their. And today to see how amazing the staff at Madera VeriZon was. So professional. And Shaw location no words just horrible service.
Found my favorite Verizon.<//text>

I was greeted at the door with pleasure. I had problems with my phone thinking I needed new battery but Chris the agent helped resolved my problem without having to repair my phone. Here also helped me gain a better understanding of the phone. I highly recommend this Verizon store as the best I've been to since moving back to California.</text>

I ONLY GO HERE TO PAY MY BROTHER-IN-LAWS BILL WHEN IT'S OVERDUE AND HE IS OUT OF TOWN....I...PERSONALLY WOULD NEVER USE "VERIZON" BECAUSE THEY CHARGE DOUBLE WHAT OTHER CELLULAR COMPANIES CHARGE....ALSO....IF YOU ARE PAYING YOUR BILL IN CASH....YOU MUST HAVE "EXACT CHANGE".... OR.... THEY ROUND UP TO THE NEAREST "HIGHER DOLLAR"....(QUESTION) WHO RUNS A BUSINESS WHERE CUSTOMERS COME TO PAY BILLS....AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A PROPER "CASH REGISTER" FOR MAKING CORRECT CHANGE ???.... WHAT KIND OF OWNER IS SOOOOOOO CHEAP.... THAT HE/SHE CAN NOT AFFORD TO BUY A INEXPENSIVE CASHBOX FILLED WITH A ROLL OF : (QUARTERS/DIMES/ AND NICKLES).... THIS IS A POORLY RUN BUSINESS.... IN NEED OF PROPER BUSINESS TRAINING.... (NO CASH CHANGE IS A JOKE)(FIX IT MR. BUSINESSMAN)<//Text>

<review>I have been working with Carlos Alvaros. He has always provided superior customer services that has gain our trust and future business. I have never had such a personalized customer services experience with Verizon but his methodology should be observed and implemented in all of your stores Nationwide. It would be a tremendous success. Anyways, we all know that I could purchased electronics anywhere but the customer services is what sets this store apart.<//review>< Pics>

I wasn’t sad about my phone, but because before I had switched to this phone my photos from sentimental areas of my life never transferred over. I was so scared this was going to happen again, but after working with Alex he helped me get my phone paid for by their promotion and into a new one, as well as made sure I kept my memories of my grand babies. He also got me a tablet that I can use for Hulu!! I couldn’t thank him enough. Thank you so much!<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I'm overly pleased to say thank you, Paulina Espinoza and Stephanie Grajeda. Both this beautiful lady's helped me so much on my phone upgrade.  On a professional level that super exceeded my expectations as a business owner.  The first time I came in which was on Sunday Aug 5th, 2018. Today Sunday Aug 12, 2018 on my sisters upgrade.  I honestly can tell you that if you give them the opportunity to work with you.  You will feel as welcome as I did. I will grade them more than the 5 stars I was given.  Thank you sincerely yours Ernesto Valenzuela.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< user>

<review>I am very disappointed in Verizon. I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and when I needed to get a phone they said I need to give the 250.00 to get an iPhone and an other 250.00 for a Galaxy 9. So my boyfriend and I just walked out of the store over the weekend. My boyfriend lost his phone today and with the insurance it would be 150.00 to get him a phone. So either way we are out of a phone. I'm so going to look for another provider. So tired of everything being so expensive.  It just doesn't pay to be a loyal customer.<//review>< Pictures>

Outstanding service from the store representative you can look at our account and see where we were we've been here for three hours and he said the patience of Jobe in has gone over and Beyond his job we are very pleased in the only reason that we are still with Verizon just because he has given us outstanding service I hope that you give your employees and a boy when they go out of their way and over and above and keep this many accounts going< /text>

<Review>I came into the store today with questions about my old LG K20 that has been giving me issues for a while now and was greeted by Tyler at the door. He instantly made me feel welcomed like I never have at a Verizon store before. After going over the promitions he was able to get me out of the payments on my old device and into something that I really enjoy!! I cannot put into words how much of a blessing it is to have someone help you out and really care how your day is going and trying to help in every way possible. I will only go to the Madera location from now on because of the experience I had with Tyler and I recommend everyone go there as well. What a Blessing they have all been!!< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< username>

Verizon has great service in Madera and throughout the valley. The service is arguably the best in the area. But they are more expensive than the others and they still make you sign a contract to get their service. This particular store is easy to get to but it takes forever to get help once you're there. Even after you get through the greeting period and your name gets called, the waiting seems to continue.</text>

Found out that this isn't even a Verizon store, Verizon told me that it was the same as best buy. For a 2nd time the store has misinformed me about the phones I was purchasing and what my bill was going to be. The sales ppl will tell you anything to get you to buy a phone. I will never go back to this store. Corporate is going to give me the location of the nearest "REAL" Verizon store</text>

Chris at my store here in Madera just made everything in my world much better. I went in with major (in my opinion) tech, issues and it didn’t take him long to have all issues fixed and In working order. It was no easy task. He got it all done in a timely matter and got me on my way. I have to say my experience today was a five star event.
BIG THANKS to Chris @ Verizon in Madera.

On top of that we walked out with a Hum & Tablet as well!!!! & guess what!? All for the same price as if we would've just gotten our two phones! Freaking awesome!!!

<name>Sebastian Rivera< /name><Time>1550192361480</Time><rating>1< /rating><review>Horrible people! As I was sitting there waiting for someone to fix my phone I over heard a rep explain to another rep how they remove stuff “we don’t really need” on our bill so they can give us stuff that won’t “change our bill”. When rep came back out with my phone he told me my phone was ruined and needed a new one. I let him give me my options as he’s telling me I qualified for a new phone and “WiFi in my car” at no extra cost. WOOOOOW! This is a joke right. I walked right out of there with my phone and decided to drive to the corporate store in Fresno. Told them what happened and they fixed my phone by hitting a few buttons. This store just wants to make money and lie to you! You all should check your bill if you’ve purchased items that wouldn’t raise your bill.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I had issues with my Moto Z2 Play I wasnt able to figure out.  A Verizon rep named Andrew, figured it out and reset my apps and wifi within a few minutes.  To top it all off, I had been struggling finding a decent MP3 player app for my phone and car.  He recommended one he uses and installed it for me.  It works great, its awesome and the issues with the phone were resolved on the spot.  Best of all, he treated me with respect, not like some reps at other places who make people feel like idiots cuz they dont how to operate their hand held devices.  Props to Verizon and Andrew.</Review>< name>

<text>I've been a Verizon customer for 12 years now and I was losing hope due to this teribble Samsung j7 I had. Lucky for me when i went in I was helped by Stephanie and Johnny and they reminded me why I stay with Verizon! They got me out of this junk into my new V30 and they even paid the rest of my Samsung!! Awesome people and the best Verizon experience ive ever had. Thank you so much for saving me!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My name is Judy koehn and I walked into the Verizon store in Madera and as soon as I walked in Jessica called me over. I had damage to my old phone and she's worked with me for a long time this afternoon and just did a wonderful job. I have a complete understanding of what I need to do to use my new phone and I appreciate all of her help very much</Review>

I have to start my review with how impressed I was with Chris Cruz from the Madera store. So much so , I felt compelled to leave an online review. After a four day horrible experience with other associates and the Best Buy store in Fresno. Chris was the only person able to resolve a technical issue that was preventing me from activating my new iPhone watch.  My dilemma started the day I took my watch to get it activated at the Madera store. Two associates there, could not figure out how to activate my watch and their answer was for me to take my phone back to Bestbuy and get my money back.  So I spent the next three day hearing a lot of “Finger Pointing” between Bestbuy and Verizon on who’s fault it was that preventing me from activating my watch . I spent countless hours on the phone with different tiers of Verizon support and even making a trip to the Fresno Corpoarte Store at Blackstone and Shaw, still unable to activate my watch, still no answers and still...more  finger pointing.  So I gave the Madera store another shot, and to my luck, Chris Cruz was the person I spoke to on the phone . I explained what I had been going through and I could tell immediately , I was speaking with a person who appeared very knowledgeable and he even corrected a mistake on a different order that another associate had made on my wife’s account. Chris also told me to come in to the store today and he would help me resolve my issue with my watch.  I thougt I was speaking to the store manager, because conversing with him was on a different level from which I had experienced and I was shocked when he told me he was not a manager.  When I arrived at the store I met Chris for the first time and treated me with respect and compassion on what I had been going through for the past four days. Within ten minutes Chris, had done  what a dozen people over the phone , and in person including the Fresno Corporate store , could not do. Chris activated my watch !  I’m not one to write online reviews, however it is highly warranted in this case.  Often times, no matter what profession people may be in, dedication resoluteness and purpose to the job, get over looked. Chris is that type of person in every facet. Verizon should be proud to have an employee such as . His knowledge and professionalism should be the example of how all Verizon employees and managers should be.<//Text>

The store itself was nice enough. They have a security guard in store which I guess is a perk. The service from the staff has been mediocre. My last trip there felt rushed and impersonal. The employee helping me was not listening, giving me the ol "uh huh" treatment while I was talking to give the appearance of attention, but she wouldn't give up any eye contact and I had to keep repeating myself.<//text>

I have gotten nothing but the best service from this store from when they first opened.  I live in a rural area and my Broadband service wasn't the best but they spent a lot of time helping  my with my problems.  I did not buy the Broadband service from them.  More recently I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy Note II, again not from them.  There is a lot to learn about this phone and they offer a In-Store Workshop.  I attended this morning and the guy teaching the class couldn't have been more helpful.< /Text>

I ask them why he told me it was 19.99 and they told me the cord is 19.99 but they only sell it with the wall plug. Staff needs some mental help and retraining.

< Review>
Back in December 2017 I went down to Version in madera to get new services I was told that after 6 months which would be June or July 2018 I would be able to Upgrade my lines which I don't have to pay Deposit or 40% or 50% the cost of the phone. So Now its July 5 2018 & My husband phone is Eligible for an Upgrade & Instead of driving to a Verizon in Fresno or Madera I just went to the Verizon in kerman which the young lady there tried her best to help me. So Now Verizon saying I have to pay 40% of the phone which I was told that in 6 months after I had the service I wouldn't have to pay no 40% or 50% down or deposit all I have to pay is Sales tax& the upgrade fee. I don't know if anyone has used the Verizon app on there phone to chat with someone in customer service, well i used it to chat with someome a few times about some basic questions on some thing and I was advised that I wouldn't Have to pay any Extra but just a upgrade fee & sales taxes for Anyphone I want .. I asked about 8 times about 3 weeks apart to see what each person has to tell me and they all said about the same thing. What I don't get as well that when I got my phones lines and paid over $200 & only having the service for about 2 weeks and then you get your first first after two week and they want you to make your first payment That's not right Example: you have a customer who gets 2 phone lines and pays about $260 today & then you expect for that customer to pay in 2 weeks on the 20th their first bill thats over $150 that's not right that's not a month's worth of services that's just the phone company being MONEY HUNGRY!!! .. I should just have gotten At&t go phone I had it once I should had went with it again. I don't want Verzion anymore everything i was told was just a lie .. ALL LIES just to get you to sign up with them!!! I use to pay $130 for 3 phone lines & now $260 for 3 phone lines and to Upgrade they still want me to pay 40% for the phone. I hate Version!!!!!  .. Hate it Hate it!!!!!! I don't Recommend Verzion to my friends or Family. 😡😡😡< /Review>

Can't think of a business I've been to where I've been treated worse, lied to and disrespected. I would give 0 stars if I could. Funny thing is when I walked in the first time. I wondered why there was a security guard working there. Once I saw how they treat customers I figured out why.< /review>

Great nail salon. I’ve been coming here for many years and have loved every single mani/pedi I’ve ever gotten here. Great color selection with really reasonable prices for their services. The staff is friendly and incredibly accommodating with appointments + walk-ins.< /Text>

A nice verity of colors. Excellent service—walk-ins okay. The English amongst the staff is proficient, if not excellent! The shop is clean. Prices are reasonable.

I had a pedicure (Jade) and my nails shaped (Na).

Jade smoothed out my rough calluses, pushed back my cuticles, and painted my toes. Na did a wonderful job on squaring out my nails and< /Review>< Pictures>

I normally don’t do reviews but this was needed. Could’ve maybe passed with 3 but it was both dusty and poor service. As said chairs dusty/dirty, cleaning of tubs questionable (I only did nail extensions). Forget a warm towel  or even lotion when you finish! At that point I was just done so wanted to leave didn’t bother complaining because I won’t be back< /Text>

This place has everything you need for a decent and affordable nail experience. It's not fancy, especially compared to the other options on Grand Avenue, but the ladies are nice and willing to stay open later for customers even past closing time. I usually go to another shop down the street, but will be switching to Nail Today going forward.<//Review>

At first all these ladies look at me like if I was about to attack them ( I was all sweety from biking) so I get it . They probably don't get that many customers that went they walk in they are out of breath.
To the point now.
They do a great job, the price is pretty good.
The whole experience is just marvelous.
Totally recommend anybody to try this place.<//review><rate>5< /rate><response>None</response><username>SAADY MELENDEZ< /username><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

This place is great. I have tried  LOTS of places in Oakland. A friend took me here and I have been coming here almost exclusively for about two years. They are super friendly. Very clean, top notch quality on the pedicures and waxing. I get everything done here. Get the deluxe pedicure...extra scrub and massage only $5 more. Totally worth it.</text>

Usually get a gel manicure ($30) and have brought my boyfriend with me so we could both get a deluxe pedicure ($20). They recently got new messaging chairs which is awesome. There is plenty of parking in the area and even free two hour parking 1/2 a block away.Sally did a great job on my dazzling nails last time however all of the nail techs are skilled!< /text>< Resp>

<text>Awful place. Decided to give them a try after seeing good reviews but it was a BIG mistake! The lady doing my nails wanted me to have really short nails, she said "You don't need long nails or gel". I wanted oval nails and she insisted that I get coffin! It was terrible, I literally stood up and left without letting her finish! She charged me $40 for nothing!!<//text>< Pics>

<time>1517211639295</time><text>This place was terrible. I went because there were so many positive reviews. I went for my birthday with my two sisters from out of town. We did mani pedi’s and instead of doing them together like I asked when I set the appointment, we were separated. I did acrylic so instead of doing the pedicure first so we could all be together, I had to do my hands. The lady doing my nails was rushing and rude when I asked for shorter nails. At one point after asking a few times she finally said “no shorter!” She also did a few crooked, even though I told her they were crooked.
They were rude and rushed throughout the whole process and we all three had a terrible experience.<//text>< response>

<Review>The first stressful pedicure I've ever experienced! It was inexpensive, but also very awkward. When my girl would step away, the technician next to me would start asking me questions and bugging me all while she was working on another lady. She asked me things like: was I was finished, if I was in a hurry...all off putting and NO to all.

When my tech came back the last time, I was so frustrated...I wanted to leave. The first lady started bossing everyone around insisting I did not need the free crappy flip flops because my sandals were fine! My polish was ruined before I got out the door! What a train wreck, $25 and my time wasted! Next time, I'm going down the road, there are tons of nail salons to choose from on Grand Ave.<//Review>< Pictures>

Very poor system they have not much of a helpful system at all in case of an urgent emergency, you really don't have a choice but to go to an urgent care and or end up at the hospital. Something that can be prevented if they would answer the phones.The Dental office is probably the best they have there, and staff is amazing. It is sad because they do have some really good Dr.s. no not all, some can be rude and sound lazy, just unprofessional. Sorry can't say the same for most of their staff members, some are rude and are unethical, no etiquette. Calling to cancel the medical insurance with them. Your health isn't important much I guess.< /text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
If you had a bad experience here I suggest you do what I did and file a complaint:

Orange County Health Care Agency Patients' Rights Advocacy Services

Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's Patients' Rights Office

California Department of Consumer Affairs - Medical Board

This review is related to Susie, the office manager of Behavioral Health Services.

For anyone having to attend this location and deal with the "manager" Susie, please have somebody there to support you because she is very draining to the spirit.

She is so discouraging I have to mentally prepare myself to deal with her. She is the person I get transferred to in regards to any important forms that need to be filled out (insurance forms, paperwork etc. etc.

Somebody in that position should have patience and understanding for people who have mental illness.

She raises her voice in frustration, talks down to you, does not listen, and shows no empathy or compassion. I feel sorry for every person that has to interact with her. God forbid a mentally ill person unable to advocate for themselves.

When I had her on speaker she was raising her voice so loud to talk over me that she didn't notice my mother had got on the line to better explain an insurance problem because I wasn't getting through to her. She was getting upset with me over instructions my insurance company told me to give her. She didn't even want to call my insurance company. She said "I'm not calling your insurance!!!" Her attitude every time I speak to her is as if she's having the worst day ever. The bad mood is constant. She's plain rude.

I can't believe this organization has somebody representing them like this. So unfortunate to have a "manager" behaving in this manner, no patient care or customer service skills whatsoever. It is very frustrating to interact with someone like that, especially with assistance regarding insurance/pharmacy issues.

This person should not be working in mental health. She is unprofessional, rude, unsuitable, and unfit. She needs to be held accountable.<//Review>

The Dr. had me come in to get a different can of formula to try it out for two weeks when I went in the staff was rude and condescending, telling me other kids need this formula and I am the one that needs to provide for my son that I should go else where for free handouts after I explained what the Dr. said the staff very rudely pushed over the formula and said well just letting you know you just took the last formula in the entire facility. On a separate occasion they called trying to tell me the insurance had changed, only that's not what they were saying. The staff told me I needed to go talk to the new Dr. because she changed it and they were never even suppose to see my son. After asking why it was only brought up now she became overly dramatic with her responses. I told her I just didn't understand if its been different the whole time why were they just telling me now. she was very hostel I informed her I wanted to speak to someone else she continued to be rude. Its crazy to think that these people handle my sons medical care or let alone any tiny human. Rude Rude Rude! Zero recommendation here. Will never attend this facility again!< /Review>< Pics>

Extremely long wait times and rude staff. Doctors are good but not worth the hassle to get to them. I finally decided to look for a different pediatrician after waiting over an hour for my one year olds physical.<//text>

<review>They say they offer free COVID-19 testing, but first you have to do an over the phone consultation with a doctor which can cost anywhere from 30-175 dollars depending on your income. You don't even get to actually see a doctor so you're really only paying for the test... which is supposed to be free.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

<Review>So my daughter went in to try and get x-rays. She's 4 years old and is on the spectrum. She's terrified of going to any type of clinic and will scream and cry hysterically. Most places will try to comfort her and play a little before doing anything with her.

We walked in today and of course she started screaming and crying because she didn't want to be there. The dentist nor the dentist assistance did absolutely anything to try and calm her or make her feel a bit comfortable. One just stood there and the dentist just sat there. After a few minutes of the crying the dentist right away said that it seemed like we would have to sedate her to continue since she wasn't complying. Are they serious!? Have they never dealt with a child who did not want to be there! Not one spoke to her! Not one tried to make her feel comfortable! They're pathetic.

Then I said wow this place is really not kid friendly and they don't even try to make her comfortable. The dentist assistance just laughed. I said I don't find this funny and it wasn't a laughing situation. How hard is it to talk to a child? How hard is it to try and play with equipment or try and show her what they were going to do? That was ridiculous. We ended up just walking out and they didn't say a single thing? They didn't ask if we wanted to reschedule or see what else we could try. That was the worst service I have had for my child. I will never be returning there again. I hope they get kid friendlier for families sake and not just automatically offer sedation when they don't want to deal with a kid.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I highly recommend Friends of Family health center for all ages. They have the most amazing & caring Doctor's and staff here. Friends of Family offers medical, dental, obgyn and behavioral health for all ages.
Today my 8 year old daughter and I had a great experience with the dental office. Dr. Wang and her assistants Abigail & Rosalie were so kind, patient, and informative. They made my daughter feel comfortable and special. She was so nervous to start and during her cleaning with Rosalie I could tell she actually enjoyed being at the dentist. Thank you so much all for your amazing services.< /Text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. I saw Dr. Varallo for the first time and have never met such a rude doctor. He was insulting, disrespectful, and didn’t seem to care at all about what I had to say. I will absolutely never set foot in this place again. I literally left the office in tears after spending 5 minutes with Dr. Varallo. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place.<//review>

Some good doctors, some nice medical assistants, & dentist/dental assistants but it takes forever to get an appointment with them and when you finally do, they either cancel on you and reschedule you to make an appointment a month later or prolong your appointment and just prescribe you medication. For example, I tried to get a Pap smear and wet mount... waited for this appointment for a whole month just so they can give me an antibiotic they didn’t
Know if I needed or not and tell me to come back in a couple weeks. It’s always like this btw not the first< /text>

< Review>
Very professional.
Very clean.
Very courteous.
Very quick.

My 20 year old daughter and I started attending this clinic last month.
We are very content with their services.
*with the exeption of Dr Mark Varallo..he was obnoxious and rude and unprofessional! Needs to retire! Or just fire him.
Stick with the female doctors.

My 12 year old son goes to their pediatrics. The receptionist's are very sweet, courteous and professional.  Their nurses are very patient and kind. They know how to treat the children. And last but not least..#1 Doctor= Doctor Grave.
She is Awesome!. She cares.
You are not just another "number" she offers quality care for your child!
God bless this facility!!😊<//Review>

I Have been coming to this office for 7 years and the Doctors as well as the staff are amazing. The office is extremely clean, well kept and organized. I have a 7 year old and newborn twins and the Doctors are wonderful, attentive and take their time with my children. And answer any and all questions I have. As long as it can be helped I will never change offices.</text>

Explain again n again until I understand.
I choose here coz the waiting time is very short.
But all the nurses are unkind and unfriendly even if its pediatric clinic.
I don’t understand them why they aren’t smile and never make kids happy or comfortable.
Seems like no professional.
They are doing check vital sign ,weight,height only.thats all!!!!
And one more bad thing is that when my baby needs to be referred ,it takes long time to process every time.
I had to call them so many times.
Most time,they dont get the phone.</Review>< pictures>

Drs are good, but good luck if you get sick because you won't be seen until a month after, why do you need to see the dr if you feel sick in that moment, well they send you to urgent care.< /review>

We did not feel comfortable in his presence. He also lied about my health prescription on my documents for my Epilepsy. It amazes me that someone like that would still be in practice. We will never go back to this horrible place for any and all of our medical needs. We have since gotten a different doctor who actually treats people like human beings and listens and looks into our medical needs carefully. We are very blessed to be receiving the care from a real doctor. Be careful going to this place as looks can be deceiving as we found out. I would never recommend this place to any of my friends or family ever!!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Save yourself the trouble and don't come here. The service has really went down hill over the years. I've tried scheduling an appointment with my DR. And it's a minimum of 2 1/2 weeks before I can be seen. So if you're sick or injured you have to suffer for some time before you can be seen. This Doctor has been my primary Doctor since my main Doctor retired Many years ago. And it's gone down hill big time. Do yourself a favor and find a different Doctor...</review>< pics>

<text>I went in for my son's dental appointment today.  I signed him in as usual and spoke to the front desk letting them k ow my son had an appointment.  45 minutes went by and 2 patients that got there after me went in 1st.  I went up to ask when or if my son was going to be seen.  The front desk clerk went to the back to check.  She said they will see him soon.  So I asked how long?  She said she does not know.  So I asked her if she can give me another appointment.  She had an appointment available till August 10th.  I mean I waited 2 weeks for this appointment now they want another month.  By the way this is not the first time they did not do there job. 1 time is ok but the second time in out.  Looking for a new dentist.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>This has to be my family's worst experience with any medical professional. My father has been a diabetic for over 20 years, and for some reason Dr. Mark Varallo can never remember to prescribe both his insulin and the needles required for it. Doesn't do us much good to have his insulin if we don't have a way to administer it. For the third month in a row, we have had to call and fight with the office to have them authorize the prescription for the needles that accompany his insulin device.

In addition, my father went in to an office visit with symptoms of pneumonia. His doctor originally told him and his caretaker that he would prescribe antibiotics. When I went to pick up his prescription, the pharmacy told me the doctor never ordered it, despite verbally telling my father he would. When we called the next morning to ask what happened to the antibiotics, his doctor said he wouldn't be prescribing them as "they weren't really necessary." My father was hospitalized days later with pneumonia...

The doctor also refused to give my father a referral to a cardiologist weeks after he had a stint put in because he "had already seen one at the hospital."

Trying to stay on top of this office for my father's prescriptions, office visits, and health concerns has become a full time job because the doctor is absolute rubbish. He doesn't care about his patients and he is completely incompetent. We won't be subjecting my father to this man's "care" any longer.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Waited 50 mins for a 2 min visit. This was after the Drs., MA had called  the day before asking what my visit was in regards to. I know Drs cannot remember everything and every patient, but I would hope she has made notes from my previous visit... How about "Change in medication follow up in 1 month" simple and to the point. Extremely irritating!!!</text>

<text>I was seen by Dr Rouhani on July 20th and 25th for sciatica pain left side and arthritis pain and he haf enquired about itching and how i was doing told Dr Rouhani that since I had no bumps Dr FRIEDMAN dermatologist said just take clairtin until itching goes away.  Had x-ray done was recommended therapy and also told Irma Ornelas to tell Dr Rouhani that I need referral to allergist for itching she said she haf left a message
When she called past Friday, since i requested a certain therapy its still pending 4 weeks later and regarding allergist she said I'll have to check with doctor. I was furious and called prospect who authorize referrals she said no referrals from their office.  Irma Ornelas just only all talk. Their office will leave a message, but you can't talk to anyone only leave a message.  Employee don't have empathy for their patients.  Will not recommend any one to deal with this office.  Irma Ornelas should be fired. Nothing to date has been done by her.<//text><gmapID>0x80dd2ace008e7d3b:0xe072163decc0af1a< /gmapID><Time>1506111941864<//Time>< name>

<Time>1503681198843</Time><text>Dr farah is absolutely amazing! I am a new mom and she answers all my questions and is very patient and helpful and proactive. Zero complaints on her. My only qualm with tge office is i cannot get through when callinf to make an appointment. I have tried 4 different days.  On hold up to 20 minutes just to get sent to voicemail or straight to voicemail and my voicemails are not returned. I actually had to go in person to make last appointment.  Dr farah returns her voicemails promptly, but its a seperate line to actually make an appointment</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Awful place you wait along time dont matter if you have appointment for the adult side. The head doctor Mark Varallo
Is rude, ,disrespectful and not professional. What I noticed about this doctor is he seems to not real to care and dont  like  people.  I believe he forget the oath he took and why hes a doctor his also rude to staff I will never go there again and plan on telling lots of friends to stay away from the office. Google search this office and you see other comments about this same aweful doctor! He should not be there or a doctor any more if hes burner out and hates people being on medcal. Google search and see other experience</review>

<review>Horrible place rarely can get an appointment here when my daughter is sick they say it will have to wait and for this reason she has had numerous trips to the ER. they sometimes leave you on the phone and forget about you . The nurses in particular one with curly long hair is rude seems like they care about there looks more than the kids . I don’t recommend this place to any one it’s a nice facility swamped with rude abnoxious nurses and receptionist . You will wait longer to be seen than see the doctor Garunteed</review>< pictures>

I completely agree with the reviews about Dr. Mark Varallo. He was rude, unprofessional, and misdiagnosed me on a whim. Coming from a medical background, I couldn't believe he is still working.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) This is a negligence that they have done with my daughter Gisela López. With an infection that they did not know how to take care of. God willing she does not get to anything worse until today they find a bacterium that has already entered the bone. EYE WITH THAT CLINIC.

< Review>
I gave birth here in Feb. 2021. The experience was awful.

They ran out of epidural when I was 9cm dilated and I was forced to wait over 90 minutes for the anesthesiologist to return from a different surgery to medicate me. I was told, “well, it’s Saturday.”

The c-section nurses were unprofessional and while I was panicking (sobbing/hyperventilating), they giggled and talked loudly about other things while they readied my body for the unexpected surgery. Then they forced a catheter inside of me without medication. I screamed “please stop!” over and over. They held me down and forced it in. No one explained to me why they needed to do this. It still haunts me. I’ve never lost my agency like that. It traumatized me.

In postpartum care, the nurses were unprofessional, irritable, and forgetful. The bathroom did not have a shower head, so I was told to use a hand wash cloth to bathe myself at the sink daily. This was after days of laboring. The nurses used my water bottle (for my privates) to clean the toilet when I used it. The bathroom floor was always wet and filthy. The second time I used the toilet, the nurse helped me get there, then said she had to see to something and would send someone to help me off. No one ever came.

The nurses told me that my breasts were “bad” for breastfeeding and insisted that I allow them to feed my daughter formula. I refused. One got so irritated, she watched me struggle to breastfeed, and when my daughter started crying, she said “See! She’s hungry!” Then she stormed out of the room. It was awful behavior. (My daughter has been successfully exclusively breastfed). The PP nurses were just awful.

I left after only 2 days in recovery (typical time for c-section is 4 days). The food was horrendous. The PP nurses were atrocious to me. The surgery was traumatizing. There are other hospitals on the west side to have your baby—don’t choose this one.</Review>

<Text>Lied about wait times. Wait staff gave attitude to a guy when he tried to get details about how long he would have to wait: she used the phrase "if you want to believe that you can". I don't remember what she was referencing, I was just shocked that she was so rude to a guy who can barely walk and was so worried about his condition that he stayed in ER well into early hours of the morning.

They only had one ER doctor and an endless line of people.

Appaling that a hospital in such a wealthy state and such a wealthy city is too cheap to properly staff their facilities.<//Text><Rate>1<//Rate><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

My experience was great.  I was unsure about going to the Emergency Department, but happy I did as I got prompt attention, xrays right in my room with a portable device, and a good PA to diagnose and send me on my way with a support for the confirmed fracture.  I flagged down one of the nurses to please bring me water while I was waiting, and he did so.  Also, my wait was very short and all went smoothly.  Gave me a bone doc referral right down the street, able to make an appointment the next day to see.  On my way to healing.</Review>

I don't even know what to say. St. john's is the hospital my grandpa was tortured to death in. They failed his kidneys and put a tube down his throat without even giving him pain medicine and making sure he was comfortable. I can't even imagine the excruciating pain he went through.  The doctors and nurses have no respect or consideration for their patients. I wasn't able  to see him again after he entered the hospital but I saw this horrifying picture of him with his hands tied and eyes popping out of his face. It looked like a horror movie. I used to think that people became doctors and nurses because they cared about their patients well being, but now I can clearly see that is not the case. I wish I could leave 0 stars.< /review>

<Review>Discharge employees like to threaten if you think your loved one needs to stay another day. They threatened me by saying I had to pay $2,500.00 a day if I wouldn’t pick her up. They don’t even know my full name so that won’t work. They can’t charge my mom as she’s a Medicaid recipient therefore it’s illegal to even attempt to charge her for medical services. Nice try though. Did you get your life’s frustrations out?</Review>< Resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Doctors and nurses are 5/5. Food on the other hand is absolutely disgusting and inedible. At Saint Johns, apparently its a nurses job to fetch food with your CC in hand because the abhorrent food and food service. What a waste of a nurses time and skills.

My OB, the incredible Dr. Tabsh, just moved to SJ, but If given the choice, I’d go back to UCLA to birth my (3rd) baby based solely on horrible food and food service from a recent surgery I had in L&D. Whomever is in charge might want to see the menu at UCLA and make changes at St. John’s stat. Expecting moms, beware. There isn’t even a menu or options, you get a tray. More like a county jail, not the premiere west side hospital in Los Angeles. Pathetic.<//text>< pictures>

Unspeakably
Unnecessary pain and suffering of dying patients at the hands of uncaring and robotic ICU Drs and nurses.   We were in shock when Dr. Luigi in ICU stated our loved one's pain and discomfort was neither his priority or concern.  Don't expect palliative or hospice care at this hospital.<//Review>

I recently had neurosurgery at St. John's from Dr. Khosla. Everything went so smoothly from scheduling, checking in, preop, surgery, postoperative, and room stay. All the nurses and assistants were amazing. My anesthesiologist called the night before, came in during preop, and even checked on me in my room the next day. This was my 13th major surgery and this experience was amongst the best. The facilities were excellent and I felt well cared for. Only suggestion would be for the food to be a bit higher quality.<//Review>

<Text>I got my vaccines here, and had a *horrible* reaction.  I called them to ask if I should be concerned and they refused to help me.  They should have told me ahead of time what to do if the pain and fever were incapacitating, and when I called, they should have shown some interest, because I know they're required by law to report bad reactions, but because of how they brushed me off, I can't imagine they did.</Text>< GmapID>

How can I express my appreciation for all the caregivers at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. My 93 year old mother had a serious fainting episode and the wonderful service of the Santa Monica Fire Department and especially the awesome service and care from Jessica Brewer, PA and all the people that were involved in looking after mom. God bless our first responders, fire, police, doctors and nurses. They are angels on our backs!</Text>

I recently had surgery at Saint John's and was so impressed with how caring, attentive and concerned for my comfort the entire staff was. This is particularly impressive in this time of rising Covid admissions.  Their professionalism and clear competence made something that could have been terrifying, a whole lot less scary.<//text>

Seriously HORRIBLE doctors and nurses on the oncology unit. They were incredibly unpleasant and unreliable. Kept making rude remarks/jokes about patients and laughed right in front of us. The nurses and care partners are lazy and miserable every day. Kindness is free, so please learn to have some compassion for sick patients and their families</text>

The most selfish doctors and nurses I have ever come across. These people charged me $700 for a 30-day prescription of high blood pressure meds although I provided them with a valid MediCal id card. Currently I have a pending civil case against this bogus hospital. If you're low income, avoid at all cost or you may end up filing for bankruptcy!< /review>

I am disabled and have to use a cane to get around. Having to walk out with two bags of belongings and a sweater i am a fall risk. I wouldn't want to go back to this particular hospital.

Don't get me wrong, there are still some very good doctors who simply "rent" the facility to perform their surgeries, etc. But, the ones that the hospital uses like Doctor Anton Bilchik (who performed surgery on our beloved relative and we believe died as a result) are simply horrible as are the nurses and staff in general. Everyone seems so unhappy there now and there a predominant air of suppression at the facility.

Most definitely NOT a top notch facility with "world class" doctors.

If I could give St. John's negative stars I would. Have been going to St. John's for over 30 years, used to receive excellent care. No more. The most uncaring, mean,  self centered staff I've ever seen. Horrible. They don't care about patients or care. Doctors are awful, nurses worse.

Stay away from this place if you value your life. They do not care about your health only profits. I would encourage you not to donate to St. John's either. This place and staff are HORRIBLE. All they care about is their bottom line.</Text>

Not a good hospital, it's a B on leapfroggroup.org I have also heard that from two close friends who will never go back to St Johns again. Go to UCLA instead it is consistently an A rated hospital.< /text>

Listen to the people in your ER. Do not assume they don't know what their talking about just because they are not the same color or nationality as you. Thankful we got out and made it to another ER that was compassionate, ethical, and professional so they could actually get help.</review>

Most disrespectful, disinterested, uncaring, unhelpful people masquerading as “health workers” I’ve experienced. Go there if you enjoy wasting your time and being treated like a subhuman until they finally tell you to go away “we don’t want to help you” ..you it was really your fault, you thought these people were there to help, but now you know better<//review>

<text>I had endonasal surgery on June 2nd that went well and my neurosurgeon was great, but I had a terrible experience with the nursing staff. I felt that the nurses took advantage of the situation because my family members were not allowed to be there. Nobody was able to hold them accountable for their actions and to do their job. The intake nurse was terrible. She gave me her political commentary about “Killary” (you can’t make this up). She then proceeded to shave my arm and didn’t even put an IV in my arm and stuck it on my hand. When she wanted me to turn over my belongings (phone, clothes, etc.), I asked her if I could text my family real quick to let them know I’m not going to have my phone at that point going forward... she just snarled at me and gave attitude.

Once that hell was over, I eventually got into surgery and woke up into recovery. From there on out it was just a bad experience of nurses not answering calls and I simply just waited 30+ minutes for a response. My bladder was about to pop and I just had to wait for a nurse. They constantly had to be reminded to give me my medications. They left my bag on the dirty floor, never bothered to help me get anything, very rarely updated me about anything, and the list continues.

Upon recovery, they didn’t even have me walk to get blood flowing in my legs to prevent blood clots. I needed a MRI the following day after surgery and they spent hours upon hours leaving me in the dark about what was going on. I have medical devices in my body and they told me their radiology department requested a rep come out from Carlsbad to do an impedence test on my neurostimulator which had ZERO battery. Absolutely wasting hours upon hours of time. I just wanted to be discharged because of the god awful treatment and wanted to be back home with my family. Finally, they made me WALK OUT upon being discharged and not wheelchaired out. I don’t know if it’s because I am 29 years old and was on the first floor, but it was quite a thing to see.

If it were not for my neurosurgeon who only does surgeries there... I’d never go there. I highly suggest anyone who needs a surgery there to perhaps wait until you can bring a loved one in with you because their nurses cannot be trusted to do their job alone. They need to be held accountable because they don’t hold each other accountable.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Every single time i have to go to the ER at St. John's i have a warn and wonderful experience. Last weekend it was very busy. Even with that said, one of the volunteer workers brought me a sandwich and juice. The social worker Mel was very resourceful. And my Dr Bey, i wish we were related. She is an amazing doctor.
Thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart.<//text>< pics>

I absolutely LOVE this hospital.. I was here for 9 days and the staff couldn't have been more amazing♡ I had a really difficult labor and my son ended up in the NICU. The labor & delivery team was great.. especially Josephine♡
I can't speak highly enough about the NICU nurses. Perry, Susie, Linda, Leo and many others were absolutely incredible. I was there day in and day out and was astonished at how patient, kind and knowledgeable these people were. This was an extremely difficult time for me and my family but my son couldn't have been in better hands. Many nurses had 20-30 years of experience and made sure that everything was done to ensure the safety and health of my baby. I'm so very grateful for St. John's♡< /Text>

My nose surgery was at St John's Ambulatory Surgery Center. Meghan the nurse who prepped me as I went in for surgery was very kind. She explained everything that she was doing and took much care to make sure that I was as comfortable as possible every step of the way. She also called me the day before the surgery with preparation instructions.

The surgery took 1.5 hours. Both Dr Kieu and my nurse each called my wife to tell her how the surgery went (smoothly) and when she could pick me up. Timeline for the day:
- arrived at 5:30
- surgery at 7
- recovery room at 8:45
- left at 10

I had three nose surgeries done all at once:
- septoplasty
- bilateral inferior turbinate reduction
- repair of nasal vestibular stenosis (bilateral) (using latera implants)

Excluding the cost for the surgeon, $12,432.66 was billed to my insurer (includes anesthesiologist, facility, drugs they pump into me before, during, and after surgery, etc). I paid much less than that, but that is what was billed to my insurer.

They tried to get me to pre-pay a massive amount to cover the maximum estimated cost I was expected to have to pay for the surgery, which I pushed back against since the fact that I was getting three surgeries done at once meant that I would likely get them at a discount since they shared 'overhead'. The person on the phone quickly gave in and said 'then what amount are you comfortable prepaying'? I told him '$400' and he was fine with that.

Terrible ER service Saturday night.  Brought in by ambulance, given a room that wasn't clean, number 9.  Yet room had boxes of materials stacked on the counter.
Told I was discharged upon entering without an exam.  Given a G.I. cocktail and ordered to leave by nurse, no doctor.
The medical board will be notified.< /review>

This is the worst ER ever I saw, no one was in ER lobby , it is been so far 2 hours I am waiting for pink eye and still they did not call me and they claim that they are busy inside , it is just a joke . Walk to UCLA Santa Monica or Westwood . At least overthere it is reasonable to wait cause UCLA lobby is busy .<//Review>

I spent 5 hours in the ER d/t extreme abdominal pain. While the doctor and registration staff was pleasant, the hospital nursing staff was inexcusably unprofessional, uncaring, and down-right dangerous. The first nurse put an IV and pressed on my vein constantly d/t slow blood flow. Then I noticed my arm was stinging and swelling up with fluid. She sent a phlebotomist in and he said he would go get her. NEITHER of them ever came back. My mom had to search for a nurse 45 minutes later and she stared at my swollen arm and said, "the last nurse didn't give you fluid so you shouldn't be bubbling. You should be fine." I proceeded to politely ask for her to take it out and asked if I would have my blood test completed....she replied, "oh, the doctor said you didn't need it." I had come in for pain and it literally took 3 hours to get my pain meds. I had to beg for some relief....later, (I won't give the gory details) I was trying to clean myself and asked for a nurse's help. As I was cleaning myself I got really dizzy and nauseous and almost fell. I was not wearing any bottoms and the nurse instructed me to walk to the restroom. I told her I couldn't walk and needed to sit and possibly throw up. She continued to instruct me to walk to the restroom. Btw, I came in a wheelchair because I couldn't walk.....After a few minutes of going back and forth with her, I asked her just to put a large pad on the bed so I could sit and asked for nausea medication. She came back 30 minutes later with a Rx and said she couldn't give me the medication because they had already discharged me....I am a typically positive person and I was polite to everyone involved, but if I can save someone the pain of going to their ER, then I believe it's worth posting.<//review>

<review>The worst wait time. Very short staffed. People can be passing out in the waiting room and the staff don't bother to help.</review>< pics>

I had an IV that actually just leaked, unfortunately not into my body. I think they try really hard here. The ER is basically an in and out type of place where they put a minimum bandaid on you.

If there is something wrong with you, by all means go find a doctor or you will be back to the ER.  This is not the ERs fault really. It is the fault of living in a world where those who pay for health insurance can't take time to use it to take care of their health and see a doctor and use the ER for a doctor only when something is desperately wrong.< /Review>

Service is great! Boba a bit mushy and the drink is a bit sweet but it is delicious! I’m a big fan of milk tea and taro is my favorite. I’ll try other flavors next time. Thank you Tea Heart!< /review>

The caramel milk tea was good. The pearls were a bit mushy. Would go especially in a hot day.</review>

Nice stop for boba while shopping at the Livermore Outlets.  The line can get very long, but moves very quickly in my experience.  I ordered the Taro Milk Tea with pearls on my last visit.  It was really refreshing on a hot day.  The drink was almost too sweet for me, but it was still delicious.</Text>

Great place to grab a refreshing drink while I shopped! They don't out too much ice and it's not overly sweet! I really liked the guava tea with lychee jelly!</Text>

The cashier in red puffer jacket was extremely rude. Be aware they will replace the sold out items with something else without letting you know in advance. The taste of the food was bland.</review>

If we could give minus 100 stars we would! The most terrible place we've ever visited! Extremely rude staff with terrible customer service!! We were waiting for 10 minutes in line with 2 kids that just wanted something to drink. That guy just closed the window before us.< /Review>

I hope there was a 0 star option. I was watching the person who was making the so called taro milk tea and all he did was put powder, extra water to fill up the cup then he put a drop of milk and a huge dose of tea. I also asked for some grass jelly and i got one small piece for 50 cents. Compared to all the other tea places I have gone this is by far the worst. If you want real milk tea go to teaspoon of bollinger and you will never come to tea heart again.< /text>

If they had good milk tea then I would ignore their awful service. But the classic milk tea taste quite bland as sh*t and pretty watery, even worse than the instant milk tea sold in the supermarket. The cashier tried very hard to ignore her customers and talked in a very low voice quickly and impatiently. I've seen she showed annoying face to 3 asian customers, even though herself is asian. Anyway, this is an unbelievable experience I've ever had in the US. Good luck to you guys!</review>

Favorite place to get boba in the outlets. My friends and I got the house milk tea w/boba, winter melon creama and mango fruit w/mango jelly. The boba was soooo good, sweet and chewy.

The line can be a little long sometimes but staff does a good job of keeping things moving.<//Text>

Fast service, but the quality of the Pearl milk tea was disappointing. The pearls we're mushy. Too much sugar, bland tea, and milk tasted like they were from powdered milk.</text>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Ordered matcha tea and lychee milk teas both of which tasted like skim milk..the pop corn chicken was the worst. We wondered  what meat it was made of. Will never ever go here again<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I’m new to Torrance California area, I recently moved here from Va. During COVID my son had missed dentist appointments due to dentist office being closed during Mar - May 2020 time frame. As soon I moved here I found Magic Land Children’s Dentistry when driving by one day. I called to make him an appointment and they were able to get him in to see him the very next day! They are friendly professional and make my son feel very comfortable coming to the dentist. I recommend this place for children’s dentist.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Brought my 3 sons to get their teeth cleaning. I felt very comfortable bringing them in. It was not crowded and temperatures were checked. Very friendly staff, explained process and what they were doing to each child. I was able to sit right next to them which made us all feel extra comfortable. My boys love coming to see the dentist!! Thank you, Magicland for the great experience!</review>

I love bringing my kids here! I have two kids a 6 year old and a 3 year old and I bring them both here. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. They make my kids experience comfortable. The environment and the extra amenities they have to not make the kids feel less scared is a plus. I highly recommend this place especially if you have little ones. Any questions I ever have are answered efficiently and they always let me know what is best for my kids.<//text>

Where do I start! After a bad experience at another facility, this here is my top favorite! Not only customer service are extremely helpful, but the dental assistants and doctors are extremely patient and loving. They answer all your questions with no hesitation. My babies love everyone here and enjoy coming back. As a mom, you always want your kids to feel safe and they do that here! My kids trust everyone!
Thank you to everyone here especially Mary!

Since the very first moment I stepped into the office I was treated warmly and promptly. The assistant (Sergio) that took my x-rays was very kind and made sure I felt safe. Explained in words so that I can comprehend my diagnosis and proceeded in getting  my cavities filled. This office is where you want to bring your children as they have great customer service and friendly attitudes. Thank you magicland for making my experience a good one.< /Text>

First time at Magicland Dental and I have to say they exceeded my expectations! The receptionist was always a friendly and extremely helpful. First time I bring my 9 month old and fist time I bring my five year old. My five year old got a cleaning done , she was excited the entire time. Giggling with the dr. she said she can’t wait to come back ! I definitely recommend this dentist office for the kiddos.<//review>

I am very much pleased with the dentist's, hygienist's,  and staff. I brought my daughter for a second opinion,  and I'm relieved I did. They diagnosed and addressed a tooth issue right away. Her previous dentist at a private practice one week before totally missed it. The hygienists did a great job. Very clean office.Kid friendly atmosphere. I can't say enough good things about Magicland.</Review>

<Review>We have been bringing our son to this dentist office since he was of age around 2 yrs old. They are very clean and the staff is so wonderful with all the children. The best part is that each chair has a screen equipped with all the latest movies to keep the kiddos entertained. Alexandra cleaned his teeth this time and it was a breeze! So thankful for a place that we both feel comfortable being in.< /Review>< Pics>

I have been going here for more than 10 years with both of my kids. All staff and doctors are super nice and helpful. My toddler was not in a good mood once for his visit, but staff quickly calmed him down and now all his visits are fun. He enjoys the balloons, movies and games.< /Text>

My daughter had an emergency accident. Called Magicland upon recommendation of my sister. The staff was very accommodating for the emergency visit. They were short staff and still accommodated us. Yani and Mary were very accommodating. Explained everything in detail. Took preemptive steps to ensure the dental visit went smoothly.<//review>

It was my son and my daughters first time here to start It was very very packed waited for 3 hours I asked how long more I would be waiting and the dental assistant said there was 3 patients before my son so I told her Ill just have to go i couldn’t wait 3 more hours. if they knew they couldn’t handle so many patients in one day then why make so many appointments. They really need to organize their schedule.< /Text>

<Text>My daughter had a severe tooth pain. I was having issues with the insurance company. They said it wasn't going to cover to see that dentist. My daughter was crying. She was going through pain for 3 days We had to wait til Monday to see a dentist. The receptionist Idalid did not give up with the insurance company. They were bouncing us to different agents from the insurance. She was on the phone for over 2 hours. She managed to convince the insurance to clear my daughter to see the doctor. I 100 percent would recommend anyone to have your children come to magicland dental. The service was AWESOME!!! The doctor and the atmosphere there is very nice. They make the children feel at home. They treat your children like if they were there children❤️❤️< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I’ve been coming here for years with my daughter and have always received extraordinary service and care for my daughters teeth. Now I have a son that also comes here and being that he’s a toddler he gets a little scared but the doctors and staff are so nice and friendly that he tends to calm down after a bit. I love this place and Yani is very nice and helpful.< /Review>

<username>Erika Orr</username><review>My kids first visit in Torrance since we moved, and staff was super friendly. They took care of my girls with proper precautions during this pandemic. The ladies and dentist were all so personable, as well as informative. We don't really need to return because NO CAVITIES, but we did get sealants and an ortho consult.  We shall return for the next cleanings without a doubt AND its super close to home. Win!</review>< Rating>

This dental office has gotten worse in the last year. I took my children in to what was suppose to be a cleaning and 6 month check up but little to I know there is no cleaning done they just policy teeth don't bother getting any build up out. All they know how to say is he or she Need to clean bette r and to make matters worse they claimed my daughter needed about six sealant that apparently insurance didn't cover so I would have to out of pocket the cost so I take to a regular non children dental office and to my surprise she didn't need any because sealants are for teeth that have deep creves and hers were flat total
Rip off never taking them back<//text>

As you can imagine, I am extremely upset.
My son's new dentist had to remove the old dental dressings from my son's teeth because in many of them they were done incorrectly, he showed me how the dressings were joined between the two teeth without having any separation between them, it seems ethically this not It must be done, I trusted that place for a long time thinking that they had highly trained personnel but I realized that they are not, because of the cures that they practiced on my son or even they were correctly diagnosed, so long ago I am overweight my great dissatisfaction with his work< /Text>

Manager Myrna and Dr. David with their team are nice and helpful.
My 3 years old son had 16 teeth fixed by Dr. David. He explained to us patiently and in details as he understands how worrying we are as parent for sending the little one to undergo a procedure of almost an hour. He was skillful pediatric dentist with many years of experience. i would highly recommend him.<//text>

Today there was almost no wait, they are usually very busy, but that has to be a good sign! Yani was our assistant today, and she was helpful and fast.</Review>< Pics>

My daughter had asked me not to take her back to Magicland, but I insisted I took her for a cleaning because she’s getting braces next week (from a different Orthodontic office). At 22 minutes past her appointment time (we were still waiting).  I told the receptionist we were leaving & Not planning on ever returning.  I asked her to remove from any further mail, texts, etc.   The wait is always long just get in & then more waiting for actual treatment (unacceptable). The receptionists seem to be indifferent about their customer service. At my dentist I get in & out in 45min that’s w X-rays, Cleaning, & Consult. Also, The environment is some what noisy & chaotic which I now realize probably further contributes to my daughter’s dental anxiety.
There is no magic here folks.< /text>

We asked staff that if the dental insurance covers before surgery, they say it fully cover. When bills came to us from insurance company, it was not covered. We pays $800. If it covers it would be only $100. They lied to us.< /Text>

What a terrible experience. This is the second time this has happened. I waited 50 minutes for my daughters appointment and she was never seen. I left. I asked several times how much longer because no one came to check on her  and the insisted she was next for over 20 minutes. I will be switching my daughters and sons dentist immediately. Terrible customer service and they were not busy.</Text>

Both of my boys are now almost 6 and 2.5 and although they are nervous they always walk out with smiles. The staff is always friendly and smiling, every one of them.  The only downfall is that there is always a wait time but then again so is every dentist/doctor's office.  The dentist themselves are incredibly quick and the dental hygienists are super quick as well, so even though you wait in the beginning, once your in the back you'll be out quick.  On top of that, the fact that every chair is showing a cartoon is probably the reason my kids have no problem coming here, huge bonus.  Im definitely a fan of Magicland.</review><resp>{'time': 1601575091180, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback, Katy! We are so happy to hear that your sons love their time spent at our office!

<review>The first time we went here we got seen in a timely manner and they took great care of my daughter. Yesterday we just went for a 6 month check up (during a pandemic) and we were waiting for almost an hour to be seen. For some reason people that got there after us were seen before us because my child was only getting a checkup. (Eye roll) We were seen and out within 20 minutes but the wait to just be seen was ridiculous and I had to make a fuss just to get us seen. I don’t think it’s good practice to let people go first because their kid is getting more expensive procedures. It should be first come first served by appointment time, especially during a pandemic when the last thing people want to do is hang out in a room with a bunch of other people’s kids touching everything and people don’t have their masks over their noses or on their face at all.< /review>< pictures>

My kids love coming to Magicland Dental. Fun activities while waiting to get their teeth clean. Staffs are pleasant and knowledgeable. Dr David is fantastic, my younger daughter came in scared and nervous, he made her laugh and came out smiling. Dr Andean and Mary-Ann are amazing with my older daughter, she is smiling and love her clean smooth feeling teeth. Office Manager, Myrna, kept me informed and explained each procedures and take extra time on terms I didn’t understand.

I recommend Magicland Dental !!< /Review>

Super clean and running smoothly during Covid. All the associates there are super good with kids. Disney movies playinh on every dental chair. Both my kids got a balloon and a new toothbrush. They also got a Shakeys certificate for a kids pizza for being brave for their first  real cleanings. My kids get soo excited to come here. Highly recommend.</text>

Really cool facility for the kids to ease the anxiety of going to the dentist. Not everyone on staff is friendly but overall the service is excellent. I like that the  orthodontist is on site, so everything can get done at the same place. The downside is that they get too many appointments and it gets pretty busy and crowded. It’s not as bad now with COVID.
And I also love that they allow weekend appointments. This helps very much with my busy work schedule.</Text>

My son and daughter have been coming to this dental office for about 5 years now. Mariela the one working at the front desk is very nice always greets everyone kindly, the dental assistant Yani is a very nice person very polite she will help you and answer any questions you need answered my kids love her, Dr Adrian is very nice she has lots of patience with the children she makes them feel comfortable, she makes the visits fun. Today's visit went great besides finding out that my son had some cavities to get done I was so worried for his first actual treatment but thanks to Dr. David who did the treatment on my son, he was absolutely great he explained the treatment one more time before starting he made my son feel comfortable his work was quick & clean my son is usually afraid of even getting his teeth cleaned but today he was great thanks to the doctor and the assistants helping I appreciate you guys taking care of my child.</review>

Every time we have an appointment we have to wait a long time to be seen. Our last appointment was at 2 and other patient's was at 2:30 and they were called in first even though we were there on time. I think they should be more organized with their appts, I'm just tired of waiting so long every time we have an appt.< /Text>

Don't even waste your time brining your child here. They will send you 10 reminders about your appointment and your still not seen on time. They have poor communication with parent. And apparently your not allowed in the room when your child is being treated, that was my final straw. They are ridiculous if they think I will allow my 4 year old daughter to be alone with them. They doctors can careless about your child and the health of their teeth. I saw 4 kids come out kicking and screaming. That's not normal. Stay way from this office they truly have no sense of common curtesy or professionalism.<//text>

Excellent care and professional ethics, the staff were very welcoming and in positive attitudes. I was most impressed with the gentle manner in which they treated my daughter. I loved the way in which they supported and insisted that I be near by for further support. I want to thank the staff and their timing and efficiency, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!< /Review>

< Review>
To start one of my children was supposed to have a teeth cleaning. The assistant litterly took a tooth brush and less then a min brushed my sons teeth with nothing on it. Im sure the insurance was billed for a cleaning. I didnt mention anything. Then my other child needed a cap and a cavity taken care of which we waited 45 min in the mornong with no other patient's except 1 child in the facility. To find out they expect a parent to wait in another room while they do this dental work. Not happeneing..<//Review>

Great place to take kids. My 5 year old son was greeted with all smiles. The Dentist and assistants were very gentle and awesome with him. Made my son feel special and he was more relaxed. They have games and a movie theater in the waiting area so the kids can wait in peace. I definitely would recommend this place 💯.</review>

< review>
Magicland is just that, with play areas, a theater, TVs showing kid movies at each dental chair and a drawer of toys for kids to choose from, it is a welcoming environment for young children. The dentists and staff are friendly, helpful and do a great job of putting the kids at ease. My son had to have teeth extracted and that process was as gentle as possible. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have liked more information on the post-extraction care. For example, how long should he only eat soft/liquid food? Does he brush his teeth and mouthwash as usual same day? I was too distracted to ask these questions at the time, now I have to Google for answers.< /review>

They wanted me to wait outside in the car on a hot day with my son because they didn't have more room for us in the lobby. They overbook patients and expect them to wait outside on a very sunny day. They need to be better organized and stop overbooking patients if they dont have room for them in the lobby.<//Text>

<Review>Been going here regularly for my kid. Weekend is always busy but still good. Went (6/16/2020) for my kid check up.. again did wait for like 40 mins to see dentist but I like the place my kid doesn't complain so happy mom. Would recommend to kids younger they had (due to Covid-19 its closed) a play area, movie room and a screen in each chair for the kid to watch...

Went for a follow up had an appointment.. still waited for 50 mins.. went on a Wednesday at 4 pm. (9/23/2020)  consider changing dentist. But the dentist are friendly.. still thinking about other options..</Review><user_id>117110207853292629429<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b25fce9f9bd:0x70178fea8c4c4f6d<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

MY CHILD WAS TIED UP AND COULDN'T BREATHE, HE WAS SO SCARED THAT HE COULDN'T BREATHE THROUGH THE MASK BECAUSE HIS NOSE WAS BLOCKED, AND THE NURSE PUT NAPKINS IN HIS MOUTH SO THAT HE COULDN'T SCREAM, AND HE COULDN'T BREATHE. SINCERELY WISH THAT THIS CLINIC WENT BANKRUPT AND CEASED TO EXIST.</Review>

Thank you for not giving up on special needs children. They go the extra mile to make sure thing are done. I am forever great full to have found you. All the back office as well.

<Review>Today is the last time we come here. We usually have to wait 30 minutes to an hour before we are seen but today is ridiculous! Our appointment was at 11am. We arrived on time. It is now 1:20 and we still have not seen the dentist. People’s time is valuable and should be respected. I understand some procedures may run longer than expected but waiting well over two hours without being see is beyond unacceptable.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>The staff is great! The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it takes so long to seen after you arrive for your appointment and sign in. Why do you have to have an 'Appointment' to sit for an hour before you are called? Other than that issue, they are awesome!</Text>< Pictures>

My son always feels relaxed there, especially with the doctor and hygienist. He is autistic so it can be hard to get x-rays. Just depends on who we get as a technician. Overall, our experience has been very good there. The front office staff is always nice and patient.</review>

I was referred by a family member to take my son to Magicland Childrens Dental after seeing that I could not find a dentist that I felt comfortable with to see my son whom had a tooth infection and recommended Dr. Mike. I went in feeling super anxious and unsure. However, the day of the appointment everyone was very nice and made sure my son was taken cared of. Doctor Mike made my son feel comfortable and safe. He did the procedure on my son and he didn't cry or said it hurt and he had 2 extractions. The Doctor was very gentle and talked him through the whole procedure. My son came out of the room super happy. They are very knowledgable and nice.< /review>

Took both of kids to this place today
Jonathan and Valerie.  I can honestly say that I have never experienced a more genuine, professional and caring staff as the one from this establishment.  From the front desk staff to the doctor and dental assistant people.   Awesome and couldn’t ask for a better experience for our children.

I took my son to Magicland for his first ever appointment at 2. Because of the awesome kid environment and great practitioners at Magicland my son had a great experience and has never felt fear or angst about dental visits.  He's had fillings there and now at 10 he goes to the ortho.  They are efficient, informative and kind.  I would definitely recommend this dental group.<//text>

Not only are they ALWAYS running late, but they are constantly changing appointments. The orthodontist office is the worst! They are only there 3 or 4 days a week and sometimes just don't show up at all or leaving early; which makes scheduling an absolute nightmare! The wait time is completely unreasonable, taking up to 3 hours WITH AN APPOINTMENT!! They never call parents Ma'am, Sir or Mr./Ms. (Whoever), but rather, Mom/ Dad instead, even after constant request not to (because none of these grown people are my children!) The dental assistants are not gentle with small children and don't seem converse with any of them to comfort them. And some of the attitudes of the doctors, nurses, assistants and workers are just horrible. If you have a choice, DO NOT COME TO MAGICLAND DENTAL!!!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

If you need your kids teeth cleaned DO NOT come here! They only polish and it’s no wonder after all these years my son had so much build up! At that point they told me he needed a deep cleaning and REFUSED to clean his teeth! My insurance wouldn’t pay for the deep cleaning and they never followed up with me. I asked if I could please make an appointment for a cleaning at this point it’s almost been a year from his last cleaning, I was told it would be left up to the dentist there if they will do it or not! I wasn’t going to waste anymore time and took him to my dentist and wouldn’t you know, no problem, teeth cleaned they never mentioned one word of a deep cleaning! This is just 1 of many other problems I’ve experienced here! Do yourself a favor and get a real dentist to clean your child’s teeth!</Text>

We've been going here for about 6 years. The staff is friendly and helpful but it is extremely difficult to get an appointment.  We have to wait months sometimes. My daughter's have braces and that requires that they see the orthodontist atleast once a month. But they have gone up to 4 months without seeing the dentist because they are always super busy. Today we had an appointment at 4:40 and they didn't call them in until 6:00. And still had them sitting and waiting for the dentist for another 15 minutes. I already paid in full for the braces or else I would have continued the treatment elsewhere.< /review>

My son's appointment was at 9am but we didn't get called to the treatment area until 9:46am despite the fact that we arrived on time for his  appointment.  Please note: they open at 9am.  Apparently they book several patients at the same time and they just call you in the order you signed in.  They should really improve their scheduling methods.</Text>

Service is always great. Doctors and support staff great.  I will have to say that on this last visit, I found the reception area and restroom to be REALLY dirty.
Recently decided we would get braces.  Appointments go well but find that missing rubber bands, broken brackets and/or  dislodged wire will not be fixed prior to our next visit.  These issues do not constitute an emergency. No exceptions.  Not happy about that.< /review>

They have children lined up like cattle going to the slaughter! Parents are not allowed in the treatment rooms to comfort their children during what could be almost an hour of fear and anxiety with strangers in masks and gloves. I have excellent insurance so they looked for ways to charge me for unnecessary services like extracting an already loose tooth "to prevent infection" . ..are you kidding me!

Facility has everything a kid needs for entertainment, small movie theater, computers, games, toys (no books)..dont be fooled, its a distraction from the awful service!< /text>

This location seems very accommodating, unfortunately they over book clients ALL THE TIME. With that said, be prepared to be at an appointment for 2 HOURS when the treatment takes 30 minutes.</review>

I've been going here for about 6 years now with 4 of my kids and they seem to be a pretty good place.  Most of the time it is pretty packed and yes sometimes the games don't work but that's what happens when you have hundreds of kids playing them all day long. The facility is clean I've never had a problem with them explaining what they're going to do to my children or being helpful and polite with calming my kids. I would give them five stars if they weren't always so packed.< /Text>

<Review>We check in on time or early for every appointment and wait at least 30 minutes before being seen for a 5-10 minute appointment to change and tighten the bands on braces. Today we waited an HOUR and 15 minutes. It’s such a waste of time and disrespect shown to patients! If you value your time I would not recommend this orthodontist.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1598988063378, 'text': "Hi, Ross. Thank you for your review as it will help us to improve in the future.

<Text>Super long wait - we had an 8am appointment and didn’t get seen until 8:50, and the doc looked at my daughters teeth for 5 minutes and determined she had a cavity so we have to come back. They tried to charge us $75 for this visit (with no cleaning). It feels like a factory in there, wouldn’t recommend.</Text>< Name>

< review>
It's been about 6 years since by son has been here but I saw some of the reviews for this place and wanted to share what happened when I took my then 5 year old there which I believed has caused him long term psychological fear of dentistry

He had a few cavities to get fixed.  They gave him a couple of pills to  relax him before the procedure, which didn't work at all. So they tied him up in a papoose then took him into a private room, stuck an instrument to keep his mouth open so they could work on him.  I could hear him SCREAMING in TERROR and horror the whole time.  I asked if I could go in to calm him down but they wouldn't allow me saying it's some privacy issue.  They had absolutely NO REACTION OR COMPASSION. My child was a cattle being herded through for them to get their insurance money.

Looking back at it now and seeing the results it has had on my son I consider it CHILD ABUSE what they did.   The front office looks beautiful and gives the illusion that it is so kid friendly BUT IT'S ALL SMOKE AND MIRROR.

Thank God I found an amazing and gentle dentist after this incident, Dr. David Suh (in Lomita).  I told him about this incident and he was flabbergasted.  My son to this day still has a hard time having Dr. Suh work on him but it's gotten so much better because Dr. Suh will let me sit in the room and hold his hand to reassure him the whole time. (No such thing as "Privacy Issue" like at Magic Land).  And when he gets too scared Dr. Suh will stop, joke with him or walk out to give me so some time to help him calm down.  He never tries to rush us to get the next person in.

I certainly hope this place has changed their practice by now.  If your child has simple quick and easy work to be done or has no anxiety or fear then go to this place.   But I still would recommend STAYING CLEAR FROM THIS PLACE and encourage you to find a small private family dental office that is focused on the patients well being and not their bottom line.<//review>

<text>One of the worst they could care less about the patient and more about money. They lied about orthodontic treatment and did more damage then repair. Don't take your children there! They try to make you think they are good by decorating their office with toys but it is all a joke!!! The cleanings are very quick and  the tell you that you can't be with your child during their testament which is against the law.<//text>< Pictures>

Well... where do I begin ? My daughter has been going to Magicland for the past year for her ortho treatment . I knew this place had horrible reviews and I chose to go in anyway because I knew she didn’t need any fillings she’s never had a cavity before . My first day consulting with the  ortho , I asked if parents were allowed to stay with their kids and she said yes . So I went ahead and signed up with them for a 2 year contract . Up until this point all my 9 year old really needed was a lot of changing the bands kinda appointments so I became comfortable leaving her there ( it’s an assembly line with all these kids lined up ) every time I would come in to check they seemed a little hesitant of my presence and assured me she would be ok. I get it ,the place is small and maybe they didn’t want all the parents there , but today she went in to remove her expanders and she was anxious and terrified . I set my grounds and I was not going to leave her there . Sure enough they asked what I was doing there and that I was not allowed to be there due to privacy policies . I explained that today she wasn’t just going to change her bands and that she has anxiety . They were going to remove her expanders and replace with a new one. To me and to my daughter’ level of anxiety this is major . I told the dr, I’m sorry this is major work . She says oh this is not a big deal they are just replacing it . Well... I know teens that have kept their expanders for a long time just because they fear it so much . Clearly they don’t understand that your child has had many anxiety attacks prior to having this done and they really dismiss your concerns .So basically you are treated as a number with no individual attention and your child’s emotional health is not a concern to them . This place needs medical curtains or  whatever it takes to create privacy but to expect parents to hand their child without the parents supervision is absurd not to mention how is it that they have space for a movie theater and separate sessions technological toys and not have private rooms for what is most important which is the privacy and health of their patients . Disappointed to say the least .<//Text>

the only thing is that you cannot go in the room while they your kid is sedated. But you can see tru a glass door.
One thing I had to mention is that the front office personal was not as helpful as they should be and rude...
The procedure went fast ...
The place is clean and a nice  environment for children.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is TERRIBLE. First of all the ladies at the front desk have such a terrible attitude, almost like they're giving us the service for free. Yesterday at the orthodontist, we were informed that my son needed to get his upper canines extracted but they don't do teeth extractions at the orthodontist so we went here. We made an appointment for today for the extraction, so I told my husband to take a day off work so he can help me with him since he'd be sedated.  We show up today for the appointment and they tell us that the doctor that performs the extraction couldn't do it because he's on vacation!!! He's the only one who can put a patient sedation! The people were texting the doctor to ask him how to put him in sedation but we didn't want anyone putting my son under sedation other than a professional. No one told me this so my husband lost a day of work FOR NOTHING! At the end they wanted to charge me for a diagnostics that they didn't even perform! If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The people here are so unprofessional. I will NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE.</text>

<text>I took my daughter for her check up 1yr 3mths ago and they told me she needed crowns on her 4 front teeth. I was then pressured into believing the best thing for her was to sign off on this this procedure. It was such a horrible experience for her especially since her gums became very sensitive after that day. My little angel was traumatized after that experience moving forward we recently went to a NEW dentist that told us that procedure was completely unnecessary and the two front teeth and gums are infected and will now need to be removed! For the love of your kids do NOT  take them to this place they do not care for your child's best interest they just want to profit on unnecessary procedures.</text>< resp>

<Text>Bravo! They deserve a medal for the work they carry out. They demonstrate such patience and empathy for children. They stay on track with their schedule but they never make you or your kids feel rushed or unimportant. They provide the attention each of your kids deserves and the attention you come to them to give them (the kids).

My two kids get their dental attention from this branch. Sometimes my youngest has thrown a tantrum, but no one on the staff loses their cool. They must really like children or get trained for working with young people. I applaud their hard work and effort. Most of all though, I applaud the great results they give you and their attitude.< /Text>< pics>

No Magic beyond the doorstep.
I don't normally right reviews unless I am so impressed or so upset with the experience. This is by far, the worst and most traumatizing experience you can put you kid into. You, like me, will be fooled by the colors of the place, the little movie theater (you barely can see the picture), or the toys and drawings on the walls. From the moment you are waiting to be checked in, you will realize that you didn't expect you, they barely have time for you, they have no order, they have no line, it is first jump first served, and you will be lucky if they will actually serve you and not tell you "I'll be with you in a second" and then they don't.
We were initially referred here because our 5 years old has a cavity that needed filing and our regular dentist didn't have laughing gas, so we came here to have them give her laughing gas.
WARNING: Insurance doesn't cover laughing gas, so they will charge you $150 for laughing gas only. And if instead you choose the other option "the drink that makes your baby "Drunk" so that he/she forgets the horrifying experience" then the bill is even higher for this little cup ($220).
WARNING: They do not allow parents to be with their kids when they do any procedure that requires numbing or lagging gas. they will ask you to step out and which through the glass from behind the door how they are torturing your kid before the anesthetic kicks in and before the laughing gas make any effect on your kid.
WARNING: The will start the procedure whether the gas works or not, and whether the numbing works or not. And you will hear your kids screaming and crying and feeling betrayed by you for letting them take him/her from you and do what they are doing with him or her.
Warning: they put the child in supine position (flat back on and they are on top of him/her "similar to real major operation room" not in a recline position. And they will tie your child hands with a strong Velcro restrains.
WARNING: Your child will be horrified by this experience, and deeply traumatized. Laughing gas didn't work, or they didn't really have laughing gas in that mask. I am abstrusely convinced that they didn't have laughing gas and they actually charged me for nothing. My child was crying and screaming throughout the procedure, and she felt every pain and was horrified and kept saying "I want to see, I want to see" because the dentist had has hand on top of her face all the time, and kept her mouth open with a piece of plastic, and then covered her mouth with a sheet of plastic. I was concerned that she wasn't having enough space to breathe and the plastic sheet on her mouth giving moving up and down as if she was suffocating.
All the nurses did was laughing and having fun with the doctor and enjoying his stupid humor.

All the staff is young and not experienced. I don't think any of them is a parent or knows how to treat a child. We came here thinking we are doing the right thing so as not to traumatize our child with the experience of anesthetic shoots, we ended up feeling that we betrayed her trust in us and allowed them to traumatized here so badly. For the rest of that week, she kept having nightmares.

If you love your kid and you don't want to traumatize them, take them elsewhere.</Review>

<Review>Very nice place, staff is patient and explain in detail what needs to be done to your child, I love that they offer gas/sedation for children with the fear of dentists. Although my 5 year old daughter was still a little freaked out from her first dentist in hawthorne,  she did cry even with the gas, but that wasn't due to what they did to her here. They were in and out of her mouth in about 30 minutes.  So overall I'm very pleased!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b25fce9f9bd:0x70178fea8c4c4f6d<//Gmap_id>< user>

The worst. Tons of games here, problem is none work. The theater is almost always off. So I get a kid who is already nervous about going to the dentist now is upset because he can't play any of the games. The service is terrible. I've been here multiple times and they always over book. I have three kids and I schedule them all at the same time for convenience. However they always forget to schedule one of our kids. Then we have to wait longer for then to see us because they over book. I gave this place a few times thinking mistakes happen. However, after a few times of the same mistakes it becomes clear that this is who they are.</Text>

<review>I'll give them an additional star for past experiences but this time as I sit in the waiting room I'm asking myself why this place is for kids. One of the big selling points is that it's a fun place where kids can play while they wait and feel comfortable. Surprisingly though, not a single game is working. In fact the area where the video games are is completely closed off. Also, the movie theater has nothing playing. It's just a giant waiting room resembling a DMV office. My son, my wife and I are uncomfortable and unimpressed. I hope the actual dental experience will be better.</review><gmapID>0x80dd4b25fce9f9bd:0x70178fea8c4c4f6d< /gmapID>< pictures>

Bunch of crooks they tell you your kid needs all kinds of procedures just for the money, they torture kids,  they perform all kinds of procedures on healthy teeth. My baby it's not even 2 years old, dentis tell me ohh it's because of the formula, and she made it clear that was the reason why most kids get cavities. Ummm my kid is breast fed and they tell me she has cavities on 4 teeth and needs 2 crowns.  So I decided to get a second opinion and she just needed a clean up.  Don't fall for that don't let them cause unnecessary pain to your loved ones.<//text>

This was the worst dental experience ever and i have three kids!!! The doctor that took care of us had no customer service skills.  He gave us an attitude and was very brutal to my child.  I was asking him very simple questions in regards to the procedure and he couldn't answer the questions.
When you completely strap down a child, from head to toe, how can you tell if the anesthesia is working? She fainted because of the pain.  I don't understand how this is acceptable.
If you care - PLEASE GET A SECOND OPINION!!</Review>

<review>This is is the WORST place ever. I took my 5 year old daughter whom I've taken to my regular dentist before with no problem. Unfortunately, my dentist doesn't do caps on children so I went to this place. They put the anesthesia and literally a second later started drilling on her, thankfully I never left the front of the room and saw how they were treating her with no sympathy as if she was an animal. Animals deserve better treatment, I enter the room and try getting my daughter when the dentist pushed me out and threaten to call the police on me AMAZING!! I told her if she didn't let me take her I was going to call the police on her and started dialing 911. Please stay away from this place or your kids will be scarred forever.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I don't understand how this place is still in business.  They told me my 2 YO needed a ton of work that needs to be done immediately.  Second opinion proved that their diagnosis is fraudulent.  They need to shut this place down.<//Review>

Ortho side has hour long waits.  That's with an appointment. You will be waiting an hour to be called for a 15 min visit. Waste of time<//Text>

I have been coming to Magicland Dental for 14 years, never had any issues until the past year. We come with appointment and they call us 1hr after check in, but today has been the worst we have been here since 9:45am appointment at 10am. They just check both of my kids (2 and 10min after their app time), and just got told that they won't have time to perform my sons cleaning since they don't have time and we need to reschedule. Feeling angry, upset, disappointed and so many more emotions. BAD BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//Text>

WARNING!!!
Do not make the mistake our family did on allowing this place to do braces for your child.
Facts:
1.You are not getting a better price for braces.
2. They sign you up in a date contract.
3. They lack in communication with parent on where you are with your child in the progress of your child's braces
4. They do not have a set schedule of days some days they are closed or are in on the orthodontist side which vary fo Wednesday and Saturday.
5. They have such a high turn over in management employees within a year, that you can't even contest what a previous manager said.
6. They over book up to 3-4 persons for the same time.
7. Orthodontist side is only in Torrance office certain days.
Problems.
1. When you go over their contract price for broken brackets, missing rubber bands this is where they charge you.
Kids break brackets occasionally, and loose rubber bands but the office hours vary so you cannot just walk into take care of situation. Even when if you have an emergency where they do not put in the brackets right and you have a problem literally hours later and you are the last person to be seen.
If you cancel an appointment ahead of time to notify them they don't do something as easy as pulling the childs name in the computer to see that there appointment should not be set up as next available but depending on the urgency of the matter like having your mouth piece put in and tried well by the time they fit you in the teeth have already moved substantially and they have to do another mould fitting.

Please trust me as a mother of two who unfortunately brought my two kids to this place it was terrible stick, without a doubt to a Ortho office that does just braces and is open 6-7 days a week. That know that kids occasionally will break braces bands etc. and gives you a price that includes this figured in when this happens. If I hadn't waited so long the executive offices in getting back to me in trying to settle a partial reimbursement I would of sued them.  For them to get their ratings up they must of hired a social media company to help them because their ratings were always bad. I just didn't take heed.<//Review>

I took my 4-year old son here (five years ago) for a check-up and they said that he had SIX cavities and that they would need to sedate him to do the work.  They gave me the high pressure sale pitch that he had to do them RIGHT NOW.  WHAT??!!  Thankfully we declined the work and went to another dentist for a second opinion.  As you might have guessed, our second dentist did not find anything that needed work.  Now, five years later, my son has still never had a cavity.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Write a timeline first
11:00 Appointment time, we arrived early
11:48 into the waiting room
12:12 The dentist started the examination, which lasted less than three minutes, then
After changing the dental assistant to wash the teeth
12:25 leave

Because it was the first time I went to the dentist, I specifically recorded the time. I can only say that the waiting time was much longer than expected, and I will have experience in the future.
The dentist was great. Originally the child was a little tired and anxious after a long wait. The dentist calmed her uneasy soon after appearing. The process of checking the teeth was very pleasant and the child was very happy.
I originally wanted to give two stars when I was waiting. Fortunately, the dentist's examination process was good. I gave four stars. I hope to reduce the waiting time in the future and still accept it within half an hour.

(Original)
先写个时间线
11点00     预约时间，我们提前到的
11点48分 进去里面的候诊室
12点12分 牙医开始检查，持续不到三分钟，然
后换牙医助理洗牙
12点25分 离开

因为是第一次去看牙医，所以我特意记录了时间，只能说等待时间远超过预期，以后就有经验了。
牙医是很棒的，原本孩子在长时间的等待后已经有些许的疲惫和焦虑，牙医出现后很快安抚了她的不安，检查牙齿的过程很愉快，孩子也很开心。
原本等待时只想给两颗星的，还好后来牙医检查的过程都不错，给四星，希望以后能把等待时间减少，半小时内还是能接受的。< /Text>< user_name>

BE SO LITTLE ETHICAL IN YOUR WORK AND TREAT CHILDREN AS IF THEY DID NOT IMPORT TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE MORE
THE TWO INTERPRETERS THAT TOUCHED ME PESIMAS USING THE DEATH WORD TO PRESS THE TREATMENTS TO BE DONE ...... PLEASE PEOPLE IF THEY TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO THAT PLACE MAKES SURE IT IS SAFE WHAT THEY WILL DO TO THE CHILD WHY MY CHILD HAPPEN THE GREATEST TRAUMA OF HIS LIFE AFTER TAKING IT TO THAT PLACE ... ASK FOR SECOND OPINIONS BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS ... I CAN NO LONGER DO ANYTHING FOR MY SON BUT I WOULD NOT LIKE WHAT ANOTHER CHILD HAPPENED THE STEP IN THAT PLACE .............. VERY LATE IT LEADS TO A SECOND OPINION AFTER THAT AT 6 MONTHS THAT I RETURNED TO CONSULTATION TO MAGICLAND, REGULATE TOLD ME THAT I HAD ALREADY LOST FRONT TEETH THAT THE 6 MONTHS BEFORE HAD BEEN ARRANGED WHEN I WENT TO THE NEW DENTIST, HE SAID THAT HE LOST THEM FOR THE BAD WORK THAT WAS DONE, NOT FOR LACK OF HYGIENE TO TAKE THE RECORDS (X-RAYS AND NOTES FROM THE MAGICLAND DOCTORS) AND THE NEW DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT THEY DID MANY THINGS THAT THE CHILD DIDN'T NEED ... OR COULD HAVE BEEN OPTIONAL S BUT THE WORK THAT HE WAS MADE HIM WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE FOR A 4 YEAR OLD CHILD AND I DIDN'T NEVER TELL ME THAT I COULD BE OPTIONAL IF I HAD KNOWN THAT IT WAS OPTIONAL I WOULD HAVE ALLOWED IT (I AM FIRST MOTHER) ..... THE I WAS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD FOR THIS PEOPLE TO BE SO CRUEL (the 2 teeth are 6 months after going to this clinic)

<text>(Translated by Google) Terrible place my daughter wanted to make 8 cavities and two crowns when they told me I did not allow k to do anything and take her to another second opinion and what was my surprise k everything was a lie That is not done to a 6 year old girl As a mother, I am always tempted to clean it and her teeth are safe from those unscrupulous people. K Only money. Care. Parents, alert with that clinic. In my life, I take my daughter back there.
