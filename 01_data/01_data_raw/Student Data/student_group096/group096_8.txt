More than half the petals on the onion were black. I asked for blue cheese on my burger and I got a side of watery, blue cheese flavored sauce. The garlic fries were ridiculously oily and had no garlic flavor. What a waste of money this place is.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This place gives wonderful service and enjoyable menu. One of my favourite spots in the city. The meals arrived fast and the prices are economical. Will definitely recommend this place.</Review>

The food & drinks are good but the employees seem like they hate their job with their awful attitudes and their poor customer service. They ignore the customers & not too happy when they have customers.If I could give zero stars I would.<//Text>

<text>Ordered "hot" buffalo wings that "include carrots or celery" tonight.
The "hot" wings were mild at best, there was no celery or carrots included (or the option to choose either one).
Now for two dollars a wing I expect pretty good wings, and suffice it to say that these were well below average.
Thanks for a disappointing dinner.< /text>< pics>

I've enjoyed the other locations but this one is by far the worst due to the food. I have given it multiple chances cuz you know everyone has bad nights and makes mistakes. The last time I dined and pointed out an error to the waitress instead of trying to get it corrected just told us the cooks just don't care at all. I will not be back to this location again.</Text>

Great wings and beer to brighten up my Monday afternoon. Good little time here with whoever is my company. Staff is great and attentive. Wasn't very busy when I was here and the waitress made us feel right at home. Sweet Habanero sauce pretty bomb!< /Text>

Cool bar scene...Definitely worth checking out. I think they're open till midnight, they could use more beers on tap but it's a cozy little spot. It can get crowded on weekends.</Review>

Horrible service.... I order a burger and wings took 45min, and it wasn’t busy. We didn’t get napkins, ketchup or ranch. To get a refill took 10min. If I could give them a 0 star I would. Definitely not coming back.< /text>

<Text>Was excited to try a new place based on past reviews from friends, but was very dissatisfied! Was greeted, given a menu and told server would be with me shortly by the bartender. 15 minutes go by and I finally see the server and she said she’ll be with me soon as well. More time passes by (15 minutes) and I see another server and she says she’ll be with me soon. Decided to leave since I didn’t get to order anything after being there for 30 minutes. I would understand if I was served a drink, but guests were leaving and it wasn’t busy...definitely wasn’t worth my time. Not going back.< /Text><gmapID>0x80ea401a3f57510f:0x562eead780eae42<//gmapID><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Jon Taffer please rescue this place!!! The chicken strips and Fries were average the cheeseburgers were nasty. The music wasn't appropriate for kids. The whole place looks like it could use a good cleaning. Overpriced and the service is below average but they did only have one waitress so it wasn't her fault. The waitress was very nice but all in all I would not recommend & we will not go back.< /Review>

Love the lemon pepper wings.  Horrible service @ Panama location.  I purchased a twenty piece, was told it would be 15 minutes and I was there an hour waiting. And when I paid the waitress didn't give me my change. She automatically kept it as a tip, I guess. She just put my money in and closed the drawer.<//review>

The potato skins were excellent, but DO NOT trust their version of "mild"! The honey bourbon sauce is anything but mild! I can't handle anything spicy. They assured me it was mild...tongue on fire, coughing, not good.</review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Waitresses took awhile to get my order. You had two other waitresses just standing there looking at me like if I'm lost. A lady who had to go thru the front door to throw out the waste bucket stop and help me in which I was thankful for. She got a waitress from the back to help who was very nice and helpful. Now to the food, sorry the wings were very messing look like someone took a bottle of bourbon and pour it on them lol, but seriously no flavor at all not even the sweet habanero ones had no flavor or spicy taste to it. I'm giving 2 stars for that one waitress and helper who took the time to help me.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

ONLY WORTH GOING WHILE SABRINA IS WORKING! Seriously. Just went there for a quick lunch on the weekend and it was a server other than Sabrina and the service was awful. Coincidentally the weekend food was exceedingly greasy. Great during the week when Sabrina IS working, not so much on weekends when Sabrina is NOT working.< /review>

Wings are nothing special.  Above average prices. Service could be better. Sauces taste and variety are better at other places. May come again< /Text>

I recently purchased food from this establishment on Saturday for the UFC fights... We ordered wings, cheese sticks, sliders, etc.. Everything tasted good initially. Later that evening, everyone who ate the sliders got food poisoning, including my wife who is 39 weeks pregnant. I will not be eating here again nor do I reccomend it.< /Text>

Wings were okay, ate them because we don't  waste food. Noone ever checked on us the way they did at the other wing place on white lane and Hughes. Smaller, but better wings, better service.<//text>

<text>My personal favorite. Love the food, the staff and the environment. It can get pretty packed and there are very few seats but it is a great time. Never fail to stop by when I'm in town. Definitely recommend.

*Edit*

One thing you need to know about this place is that it is a small, under staffed branch. Most of the time there is one bartender and one waiter, if not, just the bartender taking care of the whole place. 9 times out of the 10, the wait is worth while. I've been a customer at this establishement for over 5 years and I am never dissapointed. Sabrina is by far the BEST bartender/waiter there. If you happen to be there when she is working, she will take care of you.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80ea401a3f57510f:0x562eead780eae42</gmapID></record>

<Text>Good wings. Understaffed and music is WWAAAAYY to loud now that they are trying to attract more crowds. I understand putting loud music on but so loud u can't hear the person next to u and the waitress can't even hear u gotta yell....good wings order to go. And maybe extra sauce because apparently they can only add a little (if u don't like dry wings)<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Food was horrible. Order a burger from there through uber eats . I requested no onions and of coarse it came with onions .And then the bottom buns was so wet and soggy .I couldn't even eat it. Called them they didn't want to fix it. So I had to go through uber eats and get a refund .Big waist of time and the people that answered the phone had no desire to fix the situation. I will never eat there again.<//Review>

1st off i went to this location on panama to get wings its was a busy night i got soggy wings that looked like they had been fried twice... I look down im stepping in something that looked like black tar, they replied with an answer of the fryer spilled, i then said i hope u didnt fry my chicken in that oil... He said no your wings been done... I get home to realize my order for pick up was not only TERRIBLE, I was told by management that the issues would be fixed... Now every time i call i get hung up on and spoke to rudely never recieved that call back from management or my proper food or money back.... Havent ate there since... (House of Wings) on Panama are way bettter quality and customer service... Your welcome for the free advice in advance...< /Text>

I've been a regular at wing it since Gi owned it. Since Alex took over it's gone down. He took his best waitress and starved her out by cutting her hours. I disagree with this and I and others I go with will not be going back and I recommend that everyone stops going starve Alex out!!!!</Review>

This is the honest truth I walked in the place had about 8 people and looked sad or depressed. I decided to give it a go order food only one person on the front and cook on the back so 2 people only during lunch hr!
The food was okay then the owner walked in and notice the 2 ladies had a lot to deal with and this guy didn't help or lift a finger.
Very sad you owner, I will never return because my lunch was on 1 hr and it took 40 min to get my meal.

Also some army people showed up and it was sad that they didn't attend ASAp so thank you for helping the military you bad owner<//review>

<Review>Ahhh yes. How can one "not" enjoy the flavorful establishment that has now become a legendary staple in the city of Bakersfield, California. Just Wing It provides a plethora of tasty delicacy that needn't be, dare I say, just wings. The Cheesy Bacon Burger is a personal favorite that is cooked to taste, and is perfected everytime. The chipotle mayo spread across the bun is a a slight spice of delight. But if it's wings you're looking for, than you've stepped into the right place. Whether you're looking for traditional wings, super spicy wings (Dead Man Walking) or simple flavors (Garlic Parmasean, Lemon Pepper) this is the right place. Do you like bacon? Because you can get your wings bacon wrapped!  Customer service is amazing here! As a returning customer, I don't ever need to ask for a beer or food. The amazing employees know what I like everytime I come in to their establishment. It's almost like walking into an episode of the hit 80's television show, "Cheers". It truly is a place where everybody knows your name.  If you need a place for great food and great customer service, Just Wing It is the place to go. Bring the family, bring the friends and come enjoy great food and a great environment.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>My experience was by far the worse in Bakersfield. The girl they had working Saturday night on 8-29-15 was so rude and her appearance was not appropriate for a restaurant. It seemed as if she was just trying to get us out so she can go home. My food was over cooked and hard it was hurting my teeth after 2 bites I coudnt do it so I asked to get something different and she right away said no. We ordered 4 orders of 10 piece wings and no one was happy with the wings so they asked for extra spicy sauce (what the wings were suppose to have) and even for that she charged us extra. The last thing was that while I was still eating she grabbed my plate thinking I was done and I told her "hey im still eating". overall the service was just terrible thanks to that girl and the food and since we were all mexicans they must of felt the need to play ganster music over and over again.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea401a3f57510f:0x562eead780eae42< /Gmap_id></record>

The fries were so stale and disgusting and ALL 3 of the flavors of wings were horrible. We got lemon pepper, chili n lime, and screamer and they were so gross. Screamer wasn't even hot.</review>

Worst waitresses in world history... like why even get the job if all you are gonna do is stay in the back by the kitchen.  Bartenders do their job... the waitresses don't!</review>

<Text>I agree to all those who have mentioned here "super slow"
severe lack of coordination among the check in and the loaders. God knows how they run this business.Because the truckers are helpless so cannot say anything.Believe me 6pallets and waiting time almost 7 hours and still the check in Guy is asking to be patient.the worst place to pick up a load.Parking is good and enough room for maneuvering.Also a rest room there.
please, never trust those reviews who have been posted under the banner of "Loccal Guide". you will find them always giving 5stars.I would like to request all the truckers,wherever they go for puck up or drop off, write a review for other truckers.Also mention the parking, space for maneuvering, and others related to trucking.Drivers are less interested in the cafe menu but in other things related to the trucking.thankyou<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place  by far has the rudest people I have ever met! The women who check you in r rude and mean. They ( the women at check in) slam the window in your face and make you wait for key for women's room while they drawings something! Sure it wasn't work replaced! Very rude women work here.    Sorry you have to be that way.  If you were a little bit nicer maybe you won't bre so nasty!!!!!!< /Text>< Pics>

I’ve been coming here since they opened about 5 years ago. Although there has been MANY changes over the years (including now that sell sushi rolls) it’s remain the same as the owners seem very involved at least I thought so til I came recently and didn’t see them out front anymore (maybe new owners ?!) regardless, when I have a craving for poke and am not in the urge to go anywhere else I come here, and it’s always satisfying. And they’ve lasted all though the poke craze and I guess that’s saying something!<//text>

Can I just say that I am so blessed to have such a great poke bowl eatery near me? Just had some takeout poke from here and it absolutely hits the spot. Portions are generous, the sauces are flavorful, and the greens are fresh. Thai tea is good and their spamasubi is 👍🏼 thank you guys! Will always be a returning customer 💯< /Text>

Took my son here so he can try Poke for the first time. Staff was very helpful, described each and every item to us.
Thank you for being patient.< /review>

Been going here since they opened. Fresh fish, attentive staff, and quality ingredients. Not too many places offer soba as a base, but this one does!< /Text>

wow this place rules.  really good value, food is excellent, super fast ( less than 2 minutes from ordering to finished). the regular size is a rather large meal.  I wouldn't be able to eat any more than that without feeling gross.< /text>

Great place! Poke options are great, pricing is good, plus they have boba! Staff is great! The hostess not only remembers us, but could recall what kind of tea we got when I couldn't remember!  On top of all that the seating area has board games which is just a bonus for a stress free coworker lunch date! Highly recommend.< /Review>

Poke has become super popular lately with many shops opening up the past few months. This is the best that I've had. Great selection. Great food. Reasonable prices and friendly staff.<//Text>

Same as before and that's the way I like it. They still have soba noodles as compared with other poke joints having only rice. They are generous with the toppings and fish. The drinks are awesome.< /review>

Little window on a wall serving delicious asada tacos! Salsa was on point and customer service was excellent as well. Definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch.</Text>

<Review>Food was really good and is definitely home made! I had the sopes, one chicken and one carne asada with beans and rice and they were both delicious. Food is very reasonably priced. Will be back for sure!< /Review>< Time>

<rating>2<//rating><review>This facility was really good when we first took my grandmother. Once they started changing ownership it went downhill. You call to talk to a nurse they don’t answer the phone. I’ve called for 2 days straight and each time I let the phone ring to the point it goes to the attendance voicemail.

Nurses don’t check on the residents for 3-4 hours at a time if that.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>My stepdad is currently in this facility and it's sad to see that a lot of employees are very rude, they don't think that they have a job because we have our family member in that facility.  I wish that the main supervisor read this comment.
I also would to say that I appreciate a couple of employees that have the kindness and the heart to work with the patients and family members.
But overall I am very disappointed in how nurses answer my questions they don't have the sensibility and the tactic to speak to human beings, I feel so bad for them because they don't project professionalism.< /Text>< response>

<review>This place is horrible. I don’t understand how
they are still open. The staff is neglectful and uncaring. Many times we found my father in-law in a state of neglect when we came to visit- we found him on the floor once after he had apparently fallen out of bed. Many times he was soaked, dirty, and unchanged. He would go hours without anyone checking on him. Do not go here for rehab or allow your loved ones to come here!</review><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Overall my experience was very good. I visited my grandmother from out of state. I called and spoke to nurses and staff at the front desk and they were kind and helpful. During my visit the staff were also professional and kind with me and my grandmother and the clients. They handled the clients with care and attention to detail and treated them well. The nurses seemed to care and I was impressed with their calm attentive work.

<rating>5<//rating><text>As a Hospice Chaplain I arrived at Vista Cove to complete a spiritual assessment with my assigned patient.  Arriving to his room and speaking with him I realize that he spoke very little English. I decided to go to the nurses station to see if I could receive some help from someone that spoke Spanish. As I was leaving his room another Vista Cove employee saw me and asked if I needed help.  I inquired of her, If she spoke Spanish? She immediately came to translate for me with the patient.  Not only were my needs being met to complete the spiritual assessment but most of all the patients needs were met. Patient requested prayer and a visit from a pastor of his faith. All was provided for him through the translation.
Thank you Vista Cove for caring employees.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Last night my mother was taken to this facility. When I arrived it was 8:00pm and the nurse at the station greeted me kindly. She was helpful had a smile and directed me to where I needed to go. My mother was happy so far so I'm  happy. I must admit a year earliar both my father and mother were here and the experience was poor.  Why is she back? Insurance and available beds in the area. Yet I have hope that changes have taken place that will allow me to come back and give a 5 star review. I do know issues are not always the hard  working staffs fault but the fault of the bottom line, profit. Let's hope the realization has taken place that long term profit and happy patience and family go hand-in-hand.< /Review><pics>None<//pics></record>

< Review>
I didn't feel they made sure my dad ate what he was supposed to, they would make excuses for why they couldn't shower him, often I would hear from other nurses how the plsce is not good and there is not enough staff, plus, the place kind of smells. I was happy to get my dad out of there. I feel they have a lot to work on in terms of organization. They lost a lot of important documents my family had signed about what to do in potential circumstances so I had to sign again, and even when we would check him out, they would misplace the sign-in sheets and have to make new ones. Some of the nurses were very nice though< /Review>

not even worthy  of any star at all.they care more about profit than patients health. i had to call police to find out where my father was, they were improperly discharged and transferred my dad to another facility with out noticed my family and consent of the patient.the in room toilet would not flush for almost a year the entire time my dad was there. i mentioned it at least 10 times to the management but they did not care. the room smell horrible most off the times.they did get a citation from the health department for improper discharge and transfer of patient.< /review>

< Review>
My dad spent his last year in Vista Cove.  They took good care of him.  They loved my dad.  My dad loved them.   When my father was passing away, he had the sweetest night shift nurses watch over him.  When he passed the one nurse stayed and held his hand and prayed with Dad.  I was 3 mins late getting there.  It warmed my heart that she stayed so he wasn't alone.  May God Bless the workers at these types of care centers.  It's a hard job.  Especially knowing that most will never get out alive.< /Review>

Its an average place.  My Dad is here and you just always wished that your loved ones are in a place you don't worry about.  This place is not reliable.  Times I call and can't get through.  When I do get through sometimes the nurse is unable to talk to me...I am told she will call me back.  Doesn't happen.  Not all nurses that my father has had are great. There are a few that do an awesome job. .reason I say is that my last visit to my dads nurse seemed bothered that I would come looking for her(I was there for 3 hrs she never came in to check my dad) so yeah I went looking for her. Unfortunately unable to move him due to health insurance ...< /text>

This place smells like a wasteland the strong smell of poop when you first walk in,  i blame the supervisors. They should keep the smell under control. There's way too many patients and not enough professional staff and the residents literally roam the facility,  its way out order. There's screaming mentally ill parients screaming 5 ft away from sane sick patients what kind of placement is that??? The only reason i gave it 1 star is because there are few staff that actually care about the well being of these people. My gramma was only there for 3 nights and the service sucked, some staff was very rude, and they told me and my family that her dialysis transportation would be arranged for 3 days , and when it came to it, they failed to secure transportation so we had to take a stroke patient on our own. The appropriate medicines were not given in the time of needed. Some weren't even given period! When the physical therapy came in the evaluate her, and them knowing she is a stroke patient with no good control of her self they had her get up with one tiny girl holding her by the shirt. When they are to have a special belt around the patient since there is fall risk. Wow there is so many things. I dont like to complain, but i seen the depression that was falling upon my grandmother and i took her out. Please if your consider this place , consider something of more quality, care for the patient. God bless i hope your loved one is worth it.<//Text>

<Text>Vista Cove is a nice looki g facility and the staff is kind and friendly.  When I arrived on a Saturday there was a check-in reception desk.   However, there was no one there.  There was a sign that says that all visitors should have visitor badges.  That should be eliminated if there is no one to disg fa tribute them.  There was an electronic sign-in / sign-out device--we utilized that.  There was no one to direct us to our destination after sign in.  We asked around and finally got directions. We visited our friend a leasr an half hour and stood the entire time because of lack of chairs.  Sue, our friend we visited was happy being there and that was our main concern.  If Vista Cove make a few adjustments, the facility would be awesome.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

My father is a patient. Dr requested a change in meds to prevent his blood pressure from dropping too low and he could engage in PT. In addition she requested a new med to be introduced to assist with getting his BP higher. After almost 2 weeks of continued low BP my mother inquired to find the change in meds never occurred. Today, after a dr visit we saw they reduced a medication required for his heart transplant with no approval from the dr. Very disappointed.<//text>

This facility was horrible for my dads care at end of life with hospice care needed.The LVN and RN would not provide proper care to my dad when in major pain.He suffered for days without his proper meds that
hospice instructed them to do.They have no customer service needs at this facility for families loved ones.</Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Basically a Hindu worship place. Idols of different gods are installed. People visit regularly. Weekends and hindu festival days it's crowded. Rituals are a regular feature. Since many Indian n American restaurants are surrounded by this mandir. As such visiting this place serves both payin respects to God as also an outing with children during weekends< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>Very soothing environment and also famous in miramar. You can tell from the crowd. They have included all God's idols. Staff is very helpful especially panditji. One should definitely visit the place. Hugh participation happens in various activities. They serve very good prasad as well. Although it closes very soon.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dbf92a25067d23:0x744197ef65b14cc8</gmapID></record>

The 2 younger priests are awesome. Always come and offer Prasad and aarti. The older priest can't be bothered. Most times I go and if he is there, he mostly is chatting with some people in the chairs. IF and when he does do an aarti or gives Prasad, he does so with a really bad attitude< /Text>

We love this little shop.  Cozy and friendly and authentically local.   Everything there is excellent.  Quiche, baked goods, service, and going today to try the ice cream! My grandson loves the carrot cake.</Text>

Bought a full veg quiche for an event and it was the best my guests have tasted. Also bought tea cookies that I saw and they were amazing. Highly recommend all baked goods!<//Review>

I must have been living under a rock for the past few years not to have discovered this wonderful place! We went in recently with our family from out of town. Everything we tasted was 5 star: scones, cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, apple streusel, cherry turnovers, soup, quiche. Go early because the delicious pastries sell out. What a treasure for Lincoln!<//text>

They have good bakery items, however they don't stick to the posted hours on their front door, or on Google.  Went there this morning thinking they open at 8.  There was another customer waiting as well.  At 8:05, they still weren't open.  Went across  the street to Rebel Hen Cafe to give them a try and when I drove back home, at 8:24 they still weren't open.  If business have changed, please post a notice on the door.  I hope all is well with management.</Review>

This place is adorable! My daughter and I were just taking a stroll and tripped over this lovely place. They have ice cream, yummy deserts, coffee creations, and even quiche. They make everything in house and offer glutten free options. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake and almost swooned...good thing I was sitting down at this cute booth. They close by 3pm so get here before then if you want to enjoy the treats.<//Review>

A quaint and small bakery in the heart of downtown Lincoln. They've got a good selection of baked goods and drinks. I definitely recommend the cinnamon rolls with the cream cheese frosting! Their mochas and chai tea are also great.</review>

love this place so much! So cute and just makes our little town so much cuter. I went in their with my friend and now I'm addicted. Keep an eye out for the cannoli's. The owner doesn't make them often but I'm trying to convince her. Pretty much anything in there is delicious. love this place <3</Text>

Adorable spot to go for some baked goods. Friendly people and cute vibe. I would recommend going for breakfast or dessert, not lunch.< /text>

<review>Such a friendly a welcoming shop! We ordered the bacon and cheese roll heated and stuffed with ham and cheese....talk about comfort food heaven! It was SO good! We also grabbed some of the day old monkey bread they had out on discount and it was still nice and gooey once heated. There is SO much to choose from whether you feel like something sweet or savory and everything we've gotten has been homefresh and delicious! So coming back!</review><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x809b3d1616da7981:0xec3b0ed7f46891c0< /gmap_id>< Time>

The coffee was great.  It was nice being local and not the chair.  There was no loud music so we could relax and talk.

I enjoyed see the bike riders stopped by for a bit to each before heading out again.  Nice also seeing the locals drop in.

If you are looking for nice local place to get a bite to each try out Whistle Stop Cafe</Text><rating>5<//rating>< name>

Wonderful little place to go in the early morning for some warm, tasty cinnamon rolls, and other pastries. They also have fresh local roasted coffee and latte for sale.</Review>

I Dont know why this place has as many stars as it does. I'm thinking they paid someone off.  cause the place I just went to, was not nearly the experience described.   I had the chicken Philly, that can be best described as....lacking in anything resembling a Philly, in taste or looks.  it was a sandwich with chunked chicken breast and unmelted provolone.  my daughter was pleased with the grilled cheese, but it is hard to mess up grill cheese....and she is 7.  wife had a taco salad, that nailed the salad part, but the taco arena consisted of Frito chips and cilantro dressing.< /text>

<Text>I was pleasantly surprised by the level of service and efficiency of this business. The workers were kind and they were friendly, all while getting the job done as expeditiously as possible. They also went out of their way to make sure that I was satisfied. One workman even noticed what appeared to be a low tire on the RV and checked it for me. I will definitely be returning again when the need arises.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80952f9cf0a97717:0xcf27250e64ae0ac3</Gmap_id>< response>

When we took my son’s car for a tune-up they quoted us only $375.00, his car was in a great condition.  Then I received a call from the shop they were saying the belt around the engine is dusty and needs to be cleaned up and wanted $950.00 total.  After we got the car, my son had a hard time with the car and took it back.  They said the computer is bad and they wanted $1,100.00.  After they replaced it, the car started shaking so bad, my son could not drive it and it was dying on the side of the road. We took it back again and this time they said it was a problem with the shocks and they wanted $1,500.00.  This time we took the car to another mechanic, but unfortunately the car was so badly damaged and ruined by these people we had to get rid off it.  Don’t trust them, don’t let them to work on your car or do anything with your car.  We lost a perfectly good vehicle working with these people.< /Text>< pics>

Horrible work that is hidden by friendly service.  These people did a real number on my Nissan Altima, all while being charming as can be.  Brought my vehicle in for very small-scale maintenance work.  They went far out of their way to find and make more problems than had ever existed on my poor sedan (which handled beautifully before they got a hold of it).  I nearly had to tear my car away from them to get it back and it has been riding shakily ever since.  These people are blatantly dishonest and know how to make more business for themselves, the kind of people you wouldn't let your wife or daughter near without being present.  I've been around a long time, and I know a con when I smell one.  I hope this review can at least direct a few patrons from making the mistake I did. STAY AWAY!</text>

Wow! Adrian did an amazing job with my car. He already did amazing work for my husband and we came in this second time and he ultimately EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. He literally removed all of my toddler’s stains from milk to old candy from the fabric. 10 STARS FOR THIS BUSINESS!< /text>

<Text>If you have ever heard, you get what you pay for, this 100% applies here. I usually wash my own cars, when i need a light wash or if I'm busy i take it to local car washes that are cheap, but i always end up disappointed with the end result. My Jeep was in need of deep cleaning after being off-road and camping multiple times, in addition to my son spilling in the back seat and sun block all over the interior doors, it was a heavy job. To top it off, my engine bay also needed a wash after being in the mud. Super detailing exceeded my expectations, Adrian had my Jeep looking better than when I bought it. Amazing work, worth every penny.< /Text>< time>

At first I was reluctant at spending the money on the Ceramic Pro Sport package. It’s not cheap.  But when I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was amazed. It looked brand new inside and out. So smooth, so clean.

Adrian is super professional. I will be bringing my other vehicles in for detailing as well. Great experience.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Adrian is very knowledgeable and great at what he does. You can tell he is very passionate about his auto detailing profession. He installed Paint protection film on my vehicle which covered the front bumper,hood, headlights, front fenders, and rear view mirrors and door cups- behind wash door handle. He also ceramic coating the vehicle. His work is outstanding and his prices are the best in town! He never tried to up sell me on anything, and even talked me down on several services because it would be wasting money based on the type of color I have on the vehicle. Adrian educated me throughout the process and always updated me on how everything was going. The turn around time was a couple days. Great guy and business overall.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTrEipUkfd3QFO4JTG7GtikhholqklpylyterA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmuY5JwZUKKrS-fkV8pqB2awi4-gm36VoQ60c8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqd4Y2vushjvbykfy1dYQ4aQ8GR2cY8hdi-N57=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsFS7q1F70z-bqYmWlz82J2_boFXCG3mtrLDN8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy2tb6cFWrEHowlxJpR7pRgLYbxCU_JBFhVTqH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyVeSvNIv0jrtCgfN302E8jvqU0mxCu1exFlV7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt9TWwNmGxsiZNGF6qfCsbsjq-PWGNZ1HFvTeU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXllA4YXeMdeQMdLSqhreEcNz0LGDk42F6o51y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Just received my Honda Accord sport back from Adrian at Superdetailing in Downey ca.
Results were phenomenal!
I took my car in for a ceramic coat and received top notch results. The car looks brand new...better than it did when I received it from the dealer. I could eat a nice steak off of it 🥩!
Highly recommend Adrian’s services, he is very knowledgeable and takes pride in his work.
I recommend people to stop by and get work done at this shop for all your detail needs.< /Review>

Wow. Adrian at Super Detailing was amazing. Words can’t explain the great job he did on my two day old X5. They put Ceramic Pro Coating on my vehicle and looks better than new. Highly recommend this Auto Detailing service in Downey. 👍🏼👍🏼</Text>

He gave my car a 3 stage polish and finished it with Ceramic Pro. The car looks better than when I purchased at the dealership. The service was fast and efficient. He communicated with me through the whole process, sent me photos of the before, during, and after. He even dropped me to my office when I brought the car in. I always appreciate great local business and would recommend this to all my family, friends, and clients. 5 stars all the way!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Came in two days ago to leave my mustang
And honestly I’ve never had my car this clean.
You can tell Adrian takes his time and gives you a run for your money!!
It’s hard to trust people already especially with your own car!
I absolutely love his work
And left my car smelling so good!!
Definitely will be back in a month! ✅🙏🏼<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1618180499688, 'text': 'Thank you for trusting us, we are always striving to meet your best expectations, our duty is always to be at the forefront of techniques, tooling and products to provide the\nbest possible service, we are proud to know that you are totally satisfied with our services and look forward to continuing to do so in the future,,,\nAgain, Thank you for your preference!'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cd035cf3491d:0xc1908c6be43ffabb< /Gmap_id></record>

I am a car enthusiast ever since I could drive. Always have had an interest in detailing and have hand washed and detailed several of my vehicles. That being said, it’s no easy task and at times gone to several mobile detail, detail shops, and can say I was never impressed and disappointed at the results after shoving $$$ for a quick 2 hour detail.

At Super Detailing, After talking to Adrian for about a half hour I could see the passion he has for auto detailing. Friendly and felt right at home.

You know that saying you pay for what you get. That’s exactly what happen. I decided to go with a full detail including Ceramic Pro paint sealer on body and wheels. Lets just say money well spent. My truck looked amazing. For a five year old truck he did a great job.

Highly recommend Super Detailing. First time in a long time I was happy with my detail and impressed. Dropped of my truck at noon and told me he might have to keep it over night to perfect the Ceramic Pro coating. Picked it up the next day at noon. That alone shows how invested and prideful Adrian is at Auto detailing.

Hands down best auto detailing service in Downey Ca.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMqjaV-IVUH1uPEObKfeYmskMbzzFjhIzRbxxx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4FxmE14UBLA1eCgbnoXtiOVUx6sl3OEb_C9r6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME1h5t0mhefTzAg476pWqnIGn2eMm2OFwUR1_Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTw23IESl-CnyCCbD8Hb-VqlXQ6oGFuXf_LGmv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo3iGao4FjL5yHWf3qqEmxEe86ElITcpNNHLtU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7qqOaKj7xEWsrBwg01ntQ4mzvs166JFGYYFX2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3Dq0p9zSUBRUL9X5zGjpsgDsCQX1Ss2eDOlcY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjU7-S3mbh2RCY06SJTMwn0RXG3w7eTXx6JJlV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnsOlETPiDDmdvK3BYKsOkmqEX4J10XY1EdVhf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm_EjgCOeNAzCqzmec_zh067OjZDGsQIMf5-L1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNj3v45vCUa-TF0GyNZs02JnHthc0ATo6qjgA0u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>The owner Adrian was very professional. I came here for an engine steam cleaning and the results were fantastic. He was very respectful and professional and gave a fair price. He even included a complimentary car wash. I would recommend Super Detailing to anyone seeking good, quality work. I had a good experience with Super Detailing. Highly recommended!<//Text>< Date>

Adrian was super accommodating, professional and super friendly! He was so kind to even work around the contents of my fiance's trunk to get everything super clean. He unloaded and loaded everything... so nice of him! The subaru crosstrek looked brand new when he was done... it was amazing! He overlooked the stain on the  inner top but the second I contacted him he had no hesitations about us bringing the car back.. trust he had a lot to work on so I don't blame him haha...thank you Adrian!< /text>

<review>All I can say is wow. Very impressed with not just the customer service but the outcome of our jeep. Well worth the investment with the Ceramic Pro. Adrian did an amazing job, took a big weight of my chest getting rid of the scratches. Super Detailing left our car looking better than when I drove it off the lot. Thanks again Super Detailing from Downey, Ceramic Pro and especially Adrian for the phenomenal work.< /review></record>

I have wondered when I go to auto shows, what places the vehicles are taken to prep for the show. This is the place! Adrian is the owner here and does an incredible job with his services. He does anything from restoring and giving life again to your daily driver, to prepping you for an award winning show. He will not disappoint.</Review>

<Review>Very professional and detailed oriented! My truck came out so beautiful and actually way better than when I bought it from the dealer! He doesn't upsell any extra unnecessary things, which I appreciated. Great work and fair prices. Highly recommend</Review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Pics>None</Pics><Text>I made 5 thousands miles cross-country road trip from Connecticut to Los Angeles. My car was so filthy, and covered with stains of all kinds of foods and beverages. My car was smelling like a skunk.
I found Adrian, and trusted him after I’ve seen his immaculately clean shop and some other jobs he had already done on other cars sitting in his shop to be picked up.
He did an amazing job, and my car never looked that good, even before my road trip.
Thank you Adrian! I highly recommend him to anyone who needs a proper and professional auto detailing!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Brian Hennigan</Name><time>1620954644923< /time><rating>5</rating><Review>The service was great; the end product was outstanding; the price was reasonable.

Here is what we did. We have a 2O12 Toyota Prius, which we generally keep outdoors. Over the years, it had acquired a lot of dings, the paint had faded, there were scratches on the doors and hood. And, the headlights had turned brownish. In short, the car was a mess. But, mechanically the car was in great shape.

We decided to have Adrian do his best to restore the car. And, the result was outstanding. He took the car yesterday morning and returned it tonight. While the work was going on, he texted us pictures of each stage in the process, showing the improvements as his work continued. and, when the car was dropped off tonight, it looked even better than his pictures.

As for pricing, Adrian gave us a set of options as to what combo of services we wanted. So, we knew the price before any work was started. He delivered the car at the price quoted. His prices are fair, not cheap. But, given the work that he put into the car, his prices are more than reasonable.

After the detailing jon on the Prius, i asked Adrian to perform his magic on my Tesla. he once again came through. he took the car to his shop. Two days later, he returned with what looked like a showroom car. In fact, the car looked better than it did on the first day I drove it (two and one half years ago). A great job. On time. And a fair (but not cheap) price.<//Review>< pics>

<text>If you care about your vehicles appearance I would definitely recommend Super Detailing. Adrian the owner is a perfectionist and is very detailed with his quality service. I got ceramic coating on my Ford Raptor. Now it’s so much easier keeping it clean. He also did a paint correction job on my black Ford Mustang that had minor overspray. After completion the 5 year old black paint looked like new ! Adrian’s years of experience and dedication definitely show in his work.<//text><response>{'time': 1618180257037, 'text': 'Thank you for trusting us, we are always striving to meet your best expectations, our duty is always to be at the forefront of techniques, tooling and products to provide the\nBest possible service, we are proud to know that you are totally satisfied with our services and look forward to continuing to do so in the future,,,\nAgain, Thank you for your preference!'}<//response>< UserId.>

Super Detailing is beyond Super!  Thanks Adrian and crew for getting my classic white Porsche 911 back to its former showroom shine.  He explained the process involved and what I should do next to keep it shining bright.  There is a reason why he was part of the exclusive team to detail Air Force One!  If you need him to detail an old classic car or a modern super car he can handle it.  Thanks again Adrian!< /Text>

Amazing detail! I only trust a few people people to detail my truck and this place is the best. The detail was a 2 step polish and a ceramic rejuvenation. All of the swirl marks are gone on my black truck. Adrian is very knowledgeable and professional. His work is solid 👍

I purchased a used Mustang in Black for my nephew and as his first car I wanted to make sure he fell in love with it at first sight. I searched for auto detailing in Downey, and I found Adrian. It didn’t take much for him to understand exactly what I was looking for. He made sure to deliver and brought the Mustang back to life with Ceramic Pro Sport Paint Sealer. I was very pleased with Adrian’s services and of course my nephew fell in love with his car. It looked and smelled like new. I’ll definitely be back! Thank you Adrian!< /review>

I finally got the full detail job on my black SUV- it is our daily driver and I had recently driven it back and forth from San Francisco... you can imagine the mosquito splatter. The interior, well... we have kids so the interior was a crime scene. But then we took it to Adrian and his guys- Wow! It is safe to say it is the best detail i have ever gotten on any of my cars, Talk about exceeding expectations! These guys are especially good with the ceramic pro applications, I recommend their services with full confidence!</text>

I dropped off a Porsche Cayenne to get detailed here a week ago and boy was I pleasantly surprised by the level of professionalism and quality. Definitely the best auto detailing service in the greater Downey area. The ceramic coating that was applied makes the vehicle look new. Really happy with the service.< /Text>

Super Detailing is a business driven by the rare combination of passion, education, and hard work. This is not your average wash and wax. Adrian and team know how to restore a car’s finish and keep it that way with the latest in protection. Every car I’ve taken there ends up looking better than I could have imagined.< /Review>

< Review>
Started looking for a quality service Auto Detailing shop close to my home. As I did a general google search I found Super Detailing and called Adrian. I drove to the shop the next day, and Adrian walked me through the different types of detailing options. At first, I thought wow kind of pricy, but this is the first time I had ever gotten a professional cleaning done on my 4 runner. After doing a little research about ceramic coating and professional auto detailing, I learned that Adrian was actually helping me out with a great price. Patiently waiting for my car to be done. I cannot emphasize enough on how AWESOME my 4 runner looked. The stains in the interior was gone, minor paint imperfections no longer present, and the shine of the paint made it look like a mirror. The detailed cleaning from inside and out and top to bottom was evident. Great work! The best part about this experience was that I left knowing I got my money’s worth. Driving off in my shiny 4 runner with a flawless exterior and interior felt so rad on this Friday afternoon.</Review>

I usually don’t follow up with reviews unless the experience is extremely poor or worth mentioning. I absolutely loved the outcome of my car vehicle! That thing went in trashed at Super Detailing, my paint was dull, the motor was covered in gunk, and not mention the inside ( I have 3 very active baseball boys) it felt like a homeless lived in there. I was embarrassed however, I really do want to thank Adrian for making me feel comfortable without judgement.
I’m extremely happy with my vehicle!!! It’s been 2 weeks and I just had someone ask me how come my car smells like NEW!!!!<//review>

Adrian is a professional at his craft. I took my car in to get the engine steam cleaned and Adrian did a professional job. I was very happy with the results. I reccomend Super Detaling  for all your auto detail needs.</review>

I went to get my 2019 Camry XLE detailed today in the morning & met with Adrian Granados. He specifically made me aware of what the detailing included. A couple of hour's later when he called & told me my car was ready to be picked up & when I arrived to his shop I was very much impressed by how much the exterior looked clean, shinny & smooth.. the interior as well looked impressive, clean & smelling fresh. I plan on doing business with him again in the future & I recommend his services to anyone that's looking to have quality type detailing done. Thank you once again Adrian. #happycustomer<//review>

The inside was steamed and had great clean refreshing scent, the outside was waxed and the headlights were cleaned as well. Besides the excellent job he did with the car, I was most impressed to see the headlights finally cleaned correctly and he added UV protection which no mom and pop car wash had ever offered that. Adrian’s shop inDowney is clean and very well kept up, I will definitely be coming back and recommending he’s services to friends and family.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I love the nurses especially how Estrella works, ever since I came with my first pregnancy now my 3rd with this office she has been taking care of me fast with taking my vitals and making sure I am no waiting for a room for a long time. She is very friendly, professional and fast paced. Dr. Meyers as well love this clinic and staff very professional. Nothing but good experiences.</Review>

The place has potential but unfortunately it's not very professional, I went in for an appointment and they had no clue why I was there. It also lacked in a major way in regards to hygiene!!< /Text>

This clinic has been the best. This is my first pregnancy and everyone is so kind, patient and informative. Nurse Estrella is wonderful and so helpful along with Dr. Gendy and Dr. Meyers.

Dr. Meyers is extremely professional and takes the time to explain everything to you. Each visit I’ve had has been fast and straight to the point which is absolutely perfect for me. Definitely recommend!</text>

<text>I know a lot of people are super impatient. But not everything can be done in 1 min. There’s pregnant women that have complications and might need more time than usual.
How you expect to come in right away and let the doctor see you right away. Any who , estrella is a really really nice person. I’m a first time mom but she made me feel like home. She made me feel comfortable & always tells me to eat and take care of myself.
Along with the other nurses. Everyone learns different. But I haven’t had any bad experiences with the other nurses. Everyone Is so sweet ! & dr. Myers is a sweetheart. Always answers all my questions!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>Coming here at first wasn’t very pleasant. The doctors ( Gendy & Myers) are very nice but the scheduling was AWFUL. COVID or no COVID. Estrella helped with that a lot, she always makes sure to help make your visit as fast and smooth as possible. The assistant Brenda is always very nice and helpful as well! I had my appointment today and it went incredibly fast and it wasn’t over crowded like it was before. If the scheduling continues like it did today I definitely recommend this place!<//text>< pics>

They overbook theirselves which makes scheduling appointments almost not worth it because you will literally be waiting for 4 hours after your appointment time(I wish I was exaggerating) just to barely be seen for 10min(if you’re not pregnant). I can believe the pregnant women receive better care but still have to wait just as long as everybody else. I don’t know how it is for the pregnant women’s follow ups, but just for check ups they barely call you back, if not at all or they take up to 3 weeks to find out any test results. It’s ridiculous how many times I’ve called after waiting 2 weeks to find out anything from them. Their communication is 1.5 out of 5. They get stuff done, it just depends on how long that will take.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>This is our second baby with Dr. Samy Farid, our Dr. Ghendy is one of the best, I see multiple reviews about the cleanliness, and I agree. Along with the phone wait times are ridiculous. Both of my pregnancies I have been helped by this wonderful nurse named “Estrella” her along with a couple of others have made my experience there pleasant amidst the hour to 2 hour waits to see the Dr., Unfortunately Dr. Daisy is no longer with them, she never took longer than 45min to see a patient.

In my opinion they need a person who can run the place efficiently and maintain cleanliness.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I been coming to this clinic for 8 years or since my first pregnancy,now on my 3rd one.
I'm happy with the service. I love Dr. Myers and Dr. Gendy,2 hours waiting time the most but I go morning appointments now its a lot faster than afternoon, it only takes an hour or less waiting time.
For the front desk employee they are helpful,especially Estrella I been knowing her for 8 years now,she's very sufficient and get her job done quick as she can during busy hours, friendly and love her positive attitude.
The only thing i didn't like is that the laboratory inside the clinic opens half day only.</review>

The nurse (Estrella) that usually takes my vitals is helpful and polite. Always try’s to have a smile even when she is extremely busy. With my first pregnancy she gave me very helpful advice. The doctors are very helpful and give you as much information as they can. Only downside is waiting  time.<//Text>

I have seen both Dr Gendy and Dr Myers and they have both been kind and have best interest for me and my child. However this clinic takes way to long to see their patients. They set you an appointment for one time and I have always been seen about 40mins to an hr after that set time or sometimes even longer. My visits with the Drs only last about 10mins if that.  No help when it can down to doing disability paperwork and they do charge for the Dr to sign off on them as well as everything needs to be printed out. The wait time for the paperwork to be filled out is a bit long as well.< /text>

<review>I feel for all the new and former mamas that come to this office. This office and the manager that runs it are all very unprofessional and rude to the moms that come here for care. I have personally witnessed multiple people tell the front office how inconsiderate they are to patient calls and in office care. They disregarded my needs as a new mom and did whatever they wanted even when I had requested specifics. They will leave you on hold for over 20 minutes and then hang up on you. This has happened multiple times to me personally. I even addressed the issues with the office manager and she didn't take responsibility for how her team operates, instead she hung up on me as well. They do the bare minimum to ensure the practice doesn't get shut down but eventually there will be enough complaints that they will get shut down. STEER CLEAR of this practice if you can. No new mom deserves to feel like she's not being heard or cared for properly ESPECIALLY if it's her first child. This office is an example of people who don't actually appreciate the job they do and the moms they help but are only really in it for the money that's made. They would not be up and running if it wasn't for the moms that have no choice but to be seen at their facility. Truly praying no mom dies while in their care because of the lack of care.<//review>< pictures>

I love Dr. Gendy he is very caring. I am high risk and had several 2nd trimester miscarriages years ago. I have two children that were born preterm and I am currently pregnant again. Dr. Gendy know of my history and immediately started to get things done as far as ordering my weekly progesterone shots and etc. He really take his time and talk with you and give you the best options possible. Also I love the manager she is a sweetheart♥️ Thank you so much for caring for me and my unborn child 23 weeks so far!</review>

Was there today and was told I couldn't get seen, due to medical pending status. I have regular medical until April 1st when I will have blueshield. They are suppose to see me because in the meanwhile I will have regular medical. I'm about a little over 5 months pregnant but I guess im not a priority. Spoke to management, didn't seem like they were trying to help me out. I ve been crying since I left the clinic due to frustration and I dont know what other clinic to go to that would receive blueshield<//Text>

I love Dr. Meyers, she takes her time to make sure all questions are answered. She is very understanding and is very attentive to concerns. This is my first pregnancy. There is a time issue, I suggest bringing food and water, and scheduling the day off because often times they don’t see you until 3 hours after your appointment time. The ants weren’t my biggest concern, people just need to clean up after themselves. The nurses in the back however, need to be a whole lot professional, they complain about their job. In my opinion, it’s worth coming here for Dr. Meyers, I just wish the waits weren’t so long and boring.</review>

My very first appointment i was waiting for 3 hours just for vitals to be taken & to get paperwork for labs. My 2nd appointment was at 9:10am & was not seen until 12 & after all the waiting the dr was in the room for less than 5 minutes & did not answer a single question or concern of mine.

Always wait 2-3 hours EVERY appointment. If my appointment is a 10:30 id be reasonable to be seen at 11,11:15 but being seen at 12:30-1:00 is ridiculous. Do not come here unless you want to spend your whole morning waiting. To top it off the actual appointment itself is no longer than 5 minutes they dont care here!!< /Text>

They over book appointments, are not following covid guidelines with how many people are in the waiting. I was told I have to call my insurance to check for coverage on lab work and when I called my insurance they said the office is supposed to contact them. Wait time is always more than an hour even for early morning appointments.</review>

The nurses in the back are so nice ! Even the one who schedules your apts . As far are the front desk , kinda rude . The wait is sooooo long ! You spend more time in the waiting room then you do when your talking to the dr ! Its always packed too !!! You schedule an apt at so and so time but you wont get seen until an hour later bc the dr is so behind on his Patients< /review>

The nurses have bad attitudes, they treat the patients badly and make you feel very uncomfortable. They don’t do their jobs right, they spend more time talking then helping you book appointments or fill out your blood work. There’s only one nurse that’s wonderful. If I could change this dr I would in a second. These nurses don’t have a care in the world, all they care about is getting paid. I don’t know how they still have a job.< /Text>

This place gives one the go around. Making different appointments for simple things. We have been here 5 different times and not once has it been in clean conditions. The staff is great behind the counter but every one else can be very rude. The best part of this location has to be the ultrasound technician she is extremely nice and informative. She needs to be duplicated and place in different places around the clinic.<//Text>

Arrived 20 minutes early to my appointment that I waited 1 month to go to. I took the day off of work and just walked out after waiting an hour and a half. There were ants all over the chairs in the waiting area cause of all the crumbs on the floor and the girl behind the receptionist's desk was at her desk texting the entire time while all her co-workers walked passed her like it was nothing new. Had to reschedule for another 3 weeks from today's date. F$#k this place.</Review>

YOU CAN'T SUE THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A TERRIBLE PRACTICE AND REQUIRE YOU TO AGREE TO ARBITRATION. They have a rating of 2 on several sites. Don't go. Unless you want to end up in a hospital for 4days with untreated infection because you never see a doctor, only nurse practitioners. And if by chance you do see a doctor after 20weeks or so, be prepared to be thoroughly ignored.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>I have waited 2 hours every single time I’ve been here. They have no respect for other people’s time. I come on time to my appointment to wait at least two hours. When you complain about the wait they tell you that you should’ve said something sooner. However, even when they are made aware of the ridiculous wait time they still make you wait for an hour longer. Do yourself a favor and go to a doctor who won’t overbook themselves and get a doctor who cares about their patients.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c25adf531dbe2f:0x58c4f9322b71aaa7< /gmapID></record>

Staff is very rude..Especially the front desk girl. They never call to remind you of your appointments and when you call to reschedule they say it's done but when you go in they always say they never put it in the system so you always end up screwed! Happened to me about 5 times already! Waste of time waiting in the office for 2-3 hours to be seen for 5 minutes and rushed out.< /Review>

I would not recommend this clinic. Not only are they very short staffed but over populated with patients. The staff is late and don't pay attention very well to when you have arrived and what time your appointment is. You will wait an hour at least before you can see the nurse practitioner. I've only seen a doctor once through my pregnancy there and saw the nurse practitioner the rest of the times. If you happen to stay with them try to at least make your appointments around 8 latest nine after that you can wait up to two hours!</Text>

They just look at you like "oh, well." Clearly the way they make there money is by making you come to pointless appointment just to pay your co pay. The staff looks miserable, every single one of them. Just a word of advice "God is good, find Jesus. He is the only one that can fill your heart with Joy, Compassion, and Wisdom." I pray to God that this pregnancy will turn out to be fine. Because clearly I cannot trust this office.</text>< Date>

<pics>None</pics><text>Awful. I've never been to such a dirty Dr office. Literally holes in the chairs, chewed up food on the floor, the bathroom has no toilet paper with stains around everything and the trash can out front is overflowing with garbage that there was trash on the floor. The staff is below competent; ex1: three different people called to verify my appointment, all of which I said yes each time. Ex2: the one to set up your appointment will tell you your appointment is for one thing and when you get there it's for something totally different. Ex3: doesn't matter what time you arrive they take in patients that arrive after you even when they are late to their own appointment. Ex4 and my biggest issue with them: they are NOT CHILD FRIENDLY. They will reschedule your appointment if you have a small child with you. I've been to obgyns in Burbank to San Diego and it's always been okay to have my toddler with me. Most important thing in my life is my family. Um hello? I'm here because I'm pregnant and they will turn me away because I have my three year old with me!? It's disgusting behavior and my kids are very well behaved and quiet. I don't let them run around like animals. I will also add that they kept skipping a woman that was there before me waiting to be checked out until she finally spoke up. Now is it a coincidence that this woman was African American and everyone they kept helping out was Hispanic. I honestly thought she was waiting for a friend until she pointed out that I was the fourth person she saw skipping her. The staff only helped after she had to get their attention. If it wasn't so late in my pregnancy I wouldn't dare stay under this Drs care. I'm only here long enough to get my work release done and I'll get a different office to go to. Stay away and research a better office.< /text>< Rating>

I was leery upon taking a chance with this office, but I was sent here by High Desert.  I cannot complain about the wait because they were surprisingly on time.  But....the doctor I saw prescribed a medication to me that could have had adverse and painful results. Luckily I read the description of the medication and found the error!  Even the pharmacist claimed she had spoken with this doctor that the medication was questionable.  I'm in the process of attempting to get my money back. I do not recommend this office under any circumstance.  It's possibly dangerous!  High Desert Medical Group should be reading these posts, since they send their patients to this office.< /text>

They scheduled me on a time and date they are not even open. I have repeated the date to confirm it and the time they asked to set, which was for 8:30am I said yes. The lady then was like okay 8 it is. And I was like okay I guess 8 than. To get there on the time and date only to find out they are CLOSED! and did not open at all the weekday. HORRIBLE!</review>

Every time I’m here for an appt it has taken no less than 2 hrs. And then u don’t even see the dr for 5 minutes. It seems like once ur in an exam room that the dr wants to rush u out even though they took forever to get u in. Horrible experience. Pregnant women do not want to sit and wait forever. We get hungry quickly< /review>

My appt was at 1430 it is now 1522 and i have not been seen at all. My appt was never confirmed, i had to call and verify my appt time. Why is it taking an hour to see your patients. Terrible medical service, customer service and lack of respect for people's time. This is completely unacceptable and should not be allowed by the Drs that are running this place. You have to have two separate appts for annual pap and birth control??? seems like insurance fraud. Ive never in my life had to deal with such procedure. I asked the front desk how much longer and got an uneasy feeling when she informed me they were waiting to clean room. Idk but if you all slack on getting your patients into room on time why would i believe you all thoroughly clean rooms. I also didn't like the fact, children are allowed. This is women's health not yhe pediatrician. Leave the kids at school, daycare or nanny. I left un-serviced. Im going to a better rated Gyno dr. I will never return. Highly disappointed.</Text>

For my very first pregnancy I had gone to Farid's office for care, not only was the staff unable to meet my needs they were not showing much care for their patients. Hardly was I even able to build a relationship with the MD's at this facility nor did I feel welcomed! My experience even after transferring to a new OB Doctor I was having issues with the staff in regards to having ALL my medical records faxed to my new Doctor. Whomever the manager was handling the records always seemed to put up a fight saying she had sent everything when in reality I was told pieces of my lab results were missing, I had come to the point where I wanted to physically just get all records in hardcopy and pay the fee. There would have been no issue in paying the fee if there was not a run-a-around in trying to get records to make sure my future appointments with a different practice would go well. Ultimately, I have had a terrible experience with this office.<//Text>

Not impressed so far.  I got a nasty gram in the mail from this office accusing me for not showing up to my Dr. Apt and that they will refuse me anymore services if I miss anymore.  They mentioned that they tried to contact me several times via phone and mail. Which I have shown up to all my apointments they set for me because they give me that little apt card.  I have never seen their number call me and leave a voicemail.  I have only seen one letter in the mail and it was only the one telling me that if I don't show up they will terminate services with me.  They rescheduled me twice already to which I politely said ok to because Dr. Samy Farid was unavailable. I'm genuinely a nice person with good manners.  I understand if he's busy, but please train your staff to be nicer and have manners.  You are ultimately a Customer Service Business and provide me with it. My insurance that I pay for out of my own pocket because I choose to not have assistance pays you.  I am nice and curtious to the staff , so please return the favor.  Thank you and Have a nice day.  ~ Cindy</review>

<Text>THIS IS THE WORST PRACTICE IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE PREGNANT AND IN NEED OF A CARING DOCTOR! YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENT PERSON EACH TIME. THE STAFF WILL TREAT YOU LIKE YOU ARE GETTING ON THEIR NERVES. YOU ASK THEM TO DO SOMETHING OR ASK THEM FOR SOMETHING AND YOU WILL NOT BE SATISFIED. THERE IS NO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DOCTOR.
WAIT TIMES ARE AVERAGE FOR A OB/GYN CLINIC BUT I WOULD RATHER WAIT FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS MY CHART. ANYTIME I WOULD BRING SOMETHING UP THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED THE DR. WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.
I HAD TO GO TOTHE ER FOR AN EMERGENCY AND THE DOCTOR JUMPED TO CONCLUSION AND PRESCRIBED ME MEDICINE WHICH I ENDED UP NOT NEEDING!!! THE SAME DOCTOR WAS VERY ROUGH WITH ME PHYSICALLY WHEN CHECKING MY NETHER REGIONS.

THERE IS ONE NURSE PRACTITIONER THERE THAT I THOUGHT WAS NICE BUT IT WAS NOT GUARANTEED THAT SHE WOULD BE SEEING ME.
THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT THEY DO NOT TELLYOU WHO WILL BE DELIVERING YOUR BABY. HOW CAN ONE ESTABLISH A BIRTH PLAN WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT DOCTOR TO TALK WITH??

The staff was clueless and rude. We waited for 90 minutes and finally left without being seen. And to add insult to injury, the staff was told FOUR times that there was no bathroom tissue and they still didn't  take care of that. Never going back!!< /text>

When i start going to. Dr samy farid everything was okay then when i hit 6 months would call them to ask them about my legs and hands swelling they said thats normal just drink water and put your legs up i did just that . so then when i hit 7 months nuthen changed  i had gotten high blood pressure they didnt even give me information on high blood pressure this was my first pregnancy i only had 2 weeks left of my pregnancy and since i had no idea why my leg was so swollen and when i asks oh its normal. So since that day i had lost my child i was 71/2 months pregnant and its somthing i have to deal with everyday not having my son . This what really hurt is when i go back to get looked at the doctor was shocked and wasn't sorry about it. Its there fault i lost my child . i will never go back to this place ever again in my life .<//text>

The office if you have time to wait a bit long but it is worth seeing the doctor.
Most of the girls who work there are all cool, I really like how Estrella and Jazmín work, they are the ones that have stayed since 2019 and for them my stay and wait is pleasant.
I give them 5 stars because my health is the most important and Dr. Gendy is the best in AV!

La oficina si tiene tiempo de esperas un poco largas pero vale la pena ver al doctor.
Las chichas que trabajan ahí en su mayoría todas son cheveres, me gusta mucho como trabaja Estrella y Jazmín que son las que han quedado desde el 2019 y por ellas mi estadía y espera es amena.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I give it 5 stars. I am a patient of Dr. Gendy, an excellent Gynecologist, very professional, a very human and patient person who explains everything in detail so that the patient understands what it is about, I am very grateful for the treatment both in the clinic and in the hospital, 2 weeks ago I had surgery on the womb and thank God, everything went well 🙏.
Thank God for putting it in my way,
Also to his assistant Jazmín, an excellent, very kind girl and always attentive to the patient, I thank her a lot for her collaboration and help 😊. Like all the staff, for me it was a very pleasant experience to have been there at the clinic, thank you very much to everybody.
Thank you very much Dr. Gendy God take care of you and always bless 🙏🤗

Gracias a Dios por ponerlo en mi camino,

Dr. Simona Mayers takes the time in the consultation, she asks everything and answers all the doubts that one has. He is very friendly. Always cheerful star, she helps you with what you need and always has a positive attitude. Brenda and Maritza are very friendly and help you with whatever you need. Although it takes time to wait but in my opinion it is worth it because in the consultation you receive the treatment that it should be.

<Review>I've been going to this particular Denny's since 2010, ever since I was raised in the county. And WOW this is the Worst service I have ever had. I am SO disappointed at the lack of common sense and this is the last strike for me. The food just isn't that great and never gets cooked right. We usually order easy meals but still. Watered down sauces here beware. Super salty chicken, barely cooked please dont eat their beef or chicken here it has expired packing dates they swap. And the worst part was the pickup order on the new app. Whoever thought it was a good idea to put heavy food items on top instead of the lightweight chips thanks. Hire non-retards.< /Review>< Date>

<Text>Good food & nice time with the family.  My server seemed really tired though.  They work some tough hours!

Went again yesterday for lunch & my server was not very friendly.  Even took my soup without asking if I was done. I wasn't. Didn't ask many questions I did the asking but my food was great just not the service.  Maybe he was stressed due to it being busy.  Sad good food & stressed servers.</Text>< Time>

As always, the consistency of good food at reasonable rates. Minor glitch...menu changed. I am certain this is due to Covid regulations. No waffles, which is why we chose Denny's in the first place.  ☹ Service was great and we will return.  It has been months and we missed our Denny's.  Glad they are open for dining IN.  Please bring back the Waffles. 😎💖< /text>

I always appreciate the service I have except my experience she did forget my toast but I'm not gonna mark any points because I love Denny's that much I've never been done wrong the employees are always nice every time I go to any Denny's. But every time I walk into a Denny's or any restaurant I always ask can I do Google reveal and I always tell mom basing my opinion off my experience<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYtMunnHouP64O0euNURneL3ZxSJPDaoyt5QSy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhDbct51d586nWvNUOu1EgVtwclG9rBD19vhSS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnJXqH_nxt_PQo0Qc8Ytn8c6RQ_Y16XWsMa79i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD14DPbnw3TyecwA4YHRDcSCvvYgcXyqdnrZke=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAJkuk3Ed8-YQ0ozg_XCMxkTJeaXTecPe4hfYV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObvUKJGOlSR_IVRv59ygWkO5QuBdPkfCIQD2oG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNrG9RnINyUKIYnqPrA6rb5qObS6CItNmL3F6R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvxVpylIC-kFt18MWn9iX_0lgoxhhJjKZHTNH2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-Dt5nZX4jAW6wB8IadVh4Mh8slO__Ub47sTQM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhyYBphlpnAFK8ArH3AoLHp7kzzCZVBSZMnE6O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP47ySulDbfDIz0TB51J-WXYBrUUnEjxw8pxAqB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsdYaD4hJy78IcX06iTIZzRTA5KGhJMYyCRh_s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809a50976ded7fc7:0xd58b43782b1a3c7e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food has always been good. Had Chicken fried steak the last time and it was all very good. Very friendly Manager at the Placerville  Denny's. Also love the $2- $8 menu. Just the right amount of the Slam breakfast for me!! Hope they keep that menu!!<//review>

I adore this place! They provide awesome dishes, their menu is rich, The chef in that place is an expert, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The food is consistently of high qualtity, the attitude towards the clients  is nice. I often go to  this place and I not even once was unhappy.  I highly recommend it.< /Review>

I can not get over how amazing the employees are. I had just been in a car accident when my tow truck driver had dropped me off at this Denny's to wait for a ride home. The employees were so fantastic and attentive. And of course the food was also great!</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Worse service ever , we waited at least ,45-50 min still no food . I asked how much more time before we received our food to 2 different waitresses THEY BOTH said "let me check and never came back to say sorry were having problems in the kitchen, or its going  to be an extra 10 min . Absolutely nothing Breakfast was ruined at that point so decided to leave horrible horrible service. I can see if the place was packed with people but it wasn't so no excuse I think the waitress simply forgot to put our order in more then once or somethings just wrong with the flow at this Denny's . Went next door to Carl's Jr's not even 5min and were eating .So disappointing.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

It was a perfect time to come because this particular day the restaurant was not busy. The food came out quickly and perfectly hot and tasty. Everything was clean including the rest room and parking lot. The server was all business which is to say she wasn't unfriendly but didn't really try to be attentive nor social and my tip reflected as much. Because I came in wearing a back pack she may have assumed I am homeless, big mistake on her part.</text>

<text>Denny's has always been a good stand by place to eat, when traveling, or at home and you just don't feel like cooking. You always know what to expect and you never disappointed. Never much surprised either, that is until last week. I had an incident with my heart which wound me up in the ICU at Marshall for 10 days. When I got out the family wanted to go to Denny's so I reluctantly tagged along. What I found out was they have a few heart healthy diets and the one I picked was exceptionally good. The price was right, the atmosphere was Denny's so all around I had a great experience. Thanks Dennys!< /text><UserId.>100977204882980042303<//UserId.><Gmap_id>0x809a50976ded7fc7:0xd58b43782b1a3c7e</Gmap_id><time>1579509892591< /time></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This place was bad there is one server who was nice but the wait to sit was long. Not only that but the wait for food was literally 1 hour and 30 minutes the milk was going bad which you can clearly smell. The bathrooms were terrible dirty and grime stuck everywhere. The food was not bad but you can tell it was sitting for a good while before it was brought out I feel bad for people going here. To top it all off people which were sat after us got their food first. I feel bad for the one waitress which was nice due to the fact she had to try and calm customer's down from anger and work on holidays.< /Review>< Pictures>

I usually visit this Dennys late at night after midnight. This is when I don't feel up to cooking and want something simple. During the week it's pretty quiet during these times and the wait is very short. There's a female waitress whom I can't remember the name, but she is very friendly and demonstrates a hard work ethic.< /text>

This was my first time in this theater. To say the least I was surprised when I walked in and found I had a bar Liquor counter in front of me and it was also a restaurant. And then you can sit in your seat in order food. This baby fine for some people but it didn't turn me on. So wouldn't be my favorite theater if I lived in this area.< /Text>

<Review>Its good for a cheap sit down breakfast with my Wife and kids. There are far better places in close proximity with way better service for a few more bucks. Can't shake a stick at the all-you-can-eat pancakes for 4 dollars though.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Really wish I could review this higher considering I grew up going to this Denny's and loved it growing up but it seems like they are going a little downhill. Staff was nice and attentive but we were not very impressed with the food. Talking to others, they've been very consistent in serving almost rock hard biscuits which I'm pretty sure isn't a staple of theirs. Everything else was fine and we were sat down very quickly.< /Text><user_id>110193148585612952698<//user_id></record>

<Review>Terrible Experience.  Was treated like dirt.  My wife was told she was wrong.  Tried to complain to manager and waitress came talking smack about the situation.  Wife got upset and left.  Manager followed her to lot and said meals would be comped.  Then manager came in and charged us for the meals besides hers.  Terrible experience.  DO NOT Recommend at all.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Went to have breakfast today and I was talked Into a better deal then what I ordered, because it came with more food and a free o.j. or coffee. But when I went to pay my bill it just said I owed $32.47
Sadly I realized later much later, How did it come to that.. When I looked at the slip it did not show anything I ordered. Not one item, just the total. I was shocked. WHAT DID THEY CHARGE ME FOR.
Not going ever again. Where are the prices for the meal I ordered???<//Text>

<review>We were there for an hour and a half. Which most of the waiting was waiting to be sat and having our order taken. I noticed alot of mad faces in the restaurant. The server was nice and our food was actually hot. I noticed the wait staff didn't work together. They would pass tables and not acknowledge that no one had gotten them drinks or needed refills.<//review>< Pics>

<Date>1532620714678< /Date><pictures>None</pictures><review>After 5 min of ordering drinks I had to ask the waiter for my coffee. There was only one other couple. Then after waiting 40 min I asked where our food was. He said it's coming shortly. Waiting almost 10 more min for our food. Then there was about 4or 5 other tables. Finally got our food and the pancakes weren't done all the way and neither was the bacon. I picked off the cooked parts. I asked for a diet coke and was given a coke.
Yes we should of left. We already waited this long and we were traveling. After eating and on the road I was so nauseated. Definitely will not be stopping the anymore.</review>< rate>

Good food. Good staff. Thanks to the bald gentleman, with the skull tattoo on his left fist, who was wearing the leather bracelt and paracord on his right hand. Very skillful customer service.

Dull customers! I specifically go out to restaurants at 1 am to easedrop on interesting conversations from shady folks! The only people who come are boring people with no criminal records! Go somewhere else for weirdos! You won’t find them here.</text>

The experience is horrible.  The food was nasty. Everytime we have gone we have had to wait forever for our food. The food we did order was cold and tasted like it was under a warmer. The hot cocoa wasn't even hot maybe luke warm. The waitress would make excuses like oh we are under staff or something like that. When we actually wrote to Denny's and complained we did not get ANY response back. Would not recommend.  Go somewhere else besides here. I wish you could give no stars because they deserve negative stars. I give this negative 5 stars.< /text>

Pretty good diner as far as Denny's go. Our server had some good-spirited sass to her, which was an amusing change. Biscuits and gravy were as good as Dennys can do and eggs were sunny side up as I like them. Free refills on coffee were timely and just the thing for powering through the rest of the day.</Text>

Get with the times and allow online ordering, for the love of all breakfast foods, please.

I've been waiting for several months now, ever since they even advertised on tv that Denny's had online ordering. You type in Placerville's Denny's on google, and there's a specific link that leads you to order online.

You can add everything you want to the cart. Only when you get to nearly the end of the transaction at hand, does it tell you, Oh! Well that's not gonna work. Just call.

It's annoying. Please set it up soon.<//text>

<Review>Possibly the worst dining experience of my life. We heard every excuse in the book, from being understaffed, to "it's not my fault" but there is NEVER a reason to wait 1.5 hours for food!!! They knew before we sat down that they were understaffed because a waitress that should be fired called in an hour before her shift and a cook called in a day before their shift and yet they still neglected to inform the people they were seating that it would be a minimum of an hour before receiving any food (if the server actually got it correct). All the people who arrived at 10 a.m. did not receive their food until after 12 p.m. and the only people that received a discount were the ones who screamed about the wait. By the way, the manager was in the kitchen "cooking" badly and everyone who receive their food complained about it being cold. We (a party of 3/value menu) also received cold food and when we complained about it, received food with a pound of hot gravy or hot butter on top of cold food. We did not receive a discount and were not able to eat our food or talk to the manager because "he was busy" after an hour-and-a-half waiting. I honestly hope everyone at this location is fired and the restaurant is closed down. By the way, there way, 2 men ( obviously regulars) that came in 30 minutes after 4 of the groups in the same section arrived, and had been waiting an hour, were sat, fed, and on their way before the other 4 groups. When one of the other groups asked why they were offered a discount and shut up. Worst, by far, worst experience of the 30 or so people that I've ever heard fight for eggs to date! Shut this place down or inform your customers of your incompetence when they walk it!!! I will be contacting the corporate office in hopes to make a change.<//Review>< pictures>

Who doesn't like a good ol' Denny's Restaraunt?
Been going to them for year's...at least since I came to this area back in 1991. It seems like this one that's left off of Placerville Drive is one of the only one's left in Eldorado County. Their always friendly, open 24 hours, and have good appetizers you can share if you don't want an accrual meal or while your waiting for your meal. Either way, it's always a good atmosphere and kind workers<//text>

The hostess was so busy talking to someone that she first failed to notice we were waiting to be seated and once seated we waited and waited for her to take our order but again she was too busy socialising that we finally got up and left and went somewhere else<//text>

<Review>Great experience, delicious food with filling portions. After a long wknd and evening drive back home we were exhausted & hungry. Aside from the great turkey bird sandwiches, we had an awesome waiter, David? , Daniel? Hmm? Anyways he was very warm & listened to our indecisive babble. Thank you night crew for the complete experience of warmth & welcome.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Absolutely atrocious.
I've ordered food several times from this location and it seems as though in the few months since I've been there quality has gone down considerably.
Ordered a to go burger and not only did it explode in the, much cheaper now, container from restaurant to car the bourbon sauce is now a very liquid overly sugared teriyaki sauce.
Really disappointed in the quality cuts.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Absolutely awful service. Waited for an hour, after 15 mins of being there, our order was taken and when we asked 45 mins later when our food would be ready, they didn't  know. There was only 2 families there when we got there, after an hour, 6 other families arrived and also waited.  We ended up paying 10 dollars in drinks and left.

After ordering we waited one hour for food . We didn't immediately complain until people who came after us were getting served.wait staff worked hard and were friendly . The excuse/ reason for slow service...Denny now takes on line orders and the kitchen couldnt keep up with in store customers AND  on lind orders.< /Review>

I don't know if it's just a sign of the times, but I've been coming to this Denny's since I was a shorty with Gramps. Anyhow. The service was pathetic, the waitress was rude and though there was nobody in the place it took FOREVER to get my meal.< /Review>

< Review>
Sat over 5min, I ask the manager for a different section as our server kept neglecting us, and the manager shook his head 'no'. As I pushed for my request, he said 'I'll send someone over.'
I came over because the person they sent keeps neglecting our table, never even got drinks, no greet, nothing.
We walked out.
I've worked these kind of jobs for years. That's ridiculous and unprofessional. Never again.< /Review>

<text>Experienced rude service by a small guy, in his thirties, who shaves his head. He seemed to go out of his way to be rude to our table not sure why? I'm a quiet person so I didn't say much. I'm a good tipper but this time I didn't feel like tipping. In addition, this is the first review I've ever written, that's how bad the service was by this one waiter that I felt so inclined to say something about it. I've had other waiters at this same restaurant and they were all pretty nice, but this one guy made me not want to go back.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>First of all I have to say I am VERY impressed with the manager, Tom. I called in a To-Go order on a busy Sun. morning, when I called back later to say "Thank you" Tom recognized my voice & even remembered my name! He was very upbeat & made it a JOY to order from him :) (Also kudos to him because I assume he was manning the front because they were down a staff member, & doing a great job!). I ordered my eggs over-medium & bacon crispy, I was worried my egg whites might still be slimy & I'd have to re-cook the bacon also. But not at all! The eggs were soo perfect, exactly what I wanted & the bacon too! Oh & the oatmeal is perfect (I like it more runny than thick). I'm pregnant & was really craving this, so I could not be more happy right now :)) Previously I chose to stay the heck away from Denny's (for about 8 yrs!) due to several negative experiences years ago at a diff. location, I won't say exactly what the last straw was because it's gross, but basically there was something in my food that shouldn't have been there :( So you can imagine my apprehensiveness about eating at any Denny's. Since visiting this location 3-4 times my trust in Denny's (at least this location) is fully restored! Every time we go the servers are upbeat & polite making it an enjoyable dining experience, & I've been pretty impressed with the food being cooked to order as well. Lastly it's a nice atmosphere, I don't know if they re-did it or maybe there was a steakhouse there previously & they kept the design/ deco., but it's a very nice setting as well. This location has turned me into a Happy HaPpY customer, very nice establishment :))) Thank you Tom & staff at Placerville Denny's!!!</text>< Pictures>

First time was bad the second time was okay it takes a long time for them to get to you and even though they didn't have a lot of people they still took a little bit too long right away they asked us what we'd like to drink we said we'd order the drinks when we order our food she said okay then about an hour past and she finally asked us what we'd like to eat weed told her the stuff and then it took about an hour and a half to get our food there's only about 18 people they're not a lot and then we got our food<//text>

If I could put 0, I totally would!!!!! We as a group like Dennys a lot especially when we travel, but this location by far the worst customer service ever! Not only did we come to an empty Dennys and were waiting for 40+ minutes to get our food, one of the party members didn't get his good at all! The waiter ended up asking what is it that you ordered?! Totally unacceptable and plain rude. Will never go back to this location again!!!</Text>

<review>I wish I could talk to the owner! I get it’s a Small homophonic place, but come on. Took 30 minuets to get out food. The waitress never even checked on us. Was rude when she did talk to us. Coffee tasted really bad. She didn’t ask if we wanted creamer like she did for the other tables. We went to pay and the (I think was the manager) had to print out our receipt. Kept tapping it for us to pay. Wouldn’t listen to what we had to say. And when he finally did he talked back to us. I didn’t drink the coffee, and he processed to say “I’ve been drinking it all day, we woke 33 gallons of it”. I don’t care it was a bad cup, don’t talk back to your costumers. I grow up here, this was my favorite place to eat but now after that rudeness never again. We chose to eat at your establishment. And you chose to be rude. My food was good, but you can tell it sat in the window. You could tell that the woman didn’t want to serve us. And the guy at the register was even worse. You never talk back to your costumers!  I will be making a complaint over management.<//review>< user_id>

<Gmap_id>0x809a50976ded7fc7:0xd58b43782b1a3c7e<//Gmap_id><text>(Translated by Google) We arrived at this place after a 4 hour car ride. We had to wait more than 45 min for our food to arrive although there were not many people in the restaurant there was only one cosinero. I think they should be a little more careful to have enough staff to serve customers on a Saturday night.

Llegamos a este lugar después de un viaje en carro de 4 hrs. Tuvimos que esperar más de 45 min para que llegara nuestra comida aunque no había mucha gente en el restaurante solo había un cosinero.
