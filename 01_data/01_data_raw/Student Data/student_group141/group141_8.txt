< Review>
Person at check out was very rude to me and started to argue with me because I didn't have a penny, I live on a fixed income and use my ebt. For some reason it said I owed a penny, when I told the cashier why did it charge me a penny and that I was using ebt, she refused to answer me and told I owed a penny, I told her I didn't have a penny. She wouldn't give me my receipt so I left.<//Review>

Pharmacy is the slowest I have ever seen. Medicine is never seen on time. Dr sends in prescription early morning and medicine will not be available till next day and that's if you call to check on it because if u don't call it will take 1 week before it's ready. Pharmacy workers are rude, not all but most. They are not organized at all. Corporate really needs to look into this pharmacy.<//review>

Pharmacist Chidi will greet you with full smile and would remember your name and would look you up before you say anything.  The checkout guys are also very pleasant.< /text>

<review>This pharmacy is really disappointing. Spent my entire morning at the doctors to find out I have bronchitis. They were the most unhelpful, unfriendly staff. Taneisha was nice in the beginning but did not help me whatsoever. When my prescriptions were ready, nobody bothered to call my name (meanwhile I’m sitting in front of them in a chair), I went to the consultant window to pick them up and when my medications were being explained I told the woman (short, Asian) that I cannot swallow pills and I that I told my doctor already. Her response was “you can chew these.” She looked super frusterated having to explain how to take the medications and what they were. I later had to call my mother (who is a nurse) to ask her what I’m supposed to take since I didn’t have it in me to argue with anyone. This is the sickest I’ve ever felt in years. I get home only to find out that THEY ARE NOT CHEWABLE, and I struggled to crush them up to swallow tiny doses for about a half an hour. I finally gave up and took NyQuil hoping it would knock me out and I could just sleep it off. It didn’t. I slept awful, the pain of coughing all night and my throat was fire. I was crying in pain and shivering in my sleep. I finally woke up and went to a cvs to have my doctor call me in a liquid prescription. If the pharmacists cared just a little bit not to rush me out of the pharmacy, she could have NOT LIED TO ME and I could have had my doctor simply call in a new prescription and I would have been fighting this infection all night. Now here I am 24 hours later still miserable and sick to the point where my throat is closed, standing at cvs waiting for a prescription that Walgreens could have helped me out with. I normally go to cvs anyways but Walgreens happened to be closer to my address. NEVER MAKING THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. Awful, careless pharmacists that rush you out and don’t care to get you better.</review>< rate>

Everyone there is really sweet but it's is the absolute slowest pharmacy I have ever witnessed. They left me on hold for 20 min before just hanging up because they're so busy. Don't just show up and think anything will get anything done in less than an hour. Ive been at least 3 times and its the same everytime. They are the worst team ever. The only reason I come here is I can't transfer one of my prescriptions. ***madface Sweet folks but horrible teamwork.< /Text>

This stores pharmacy employees really need to be re-evaluated. They all have bad attitudes and act like they don't want to help. Extremely unprofessional. I have to ask for the manager every time I need a prescription filled to make sure I have no problems in getting medication, it is very inconvenient.<//review>

<text>Pharmacy hours on the listing are wrong.  The pharmacy is open:

M-F:  8:00am - 9:00pm
Sat: 9:00am - 6:00pm
Sun: 10:00am - 6:00pm

They have a drive-thru as well, which is nice. I'm assuming the drive-thru hours match the pharmacy hours.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>unprofessional Pharmacy, I have been here many times, My physician send the request for my daughter at 11 am, and I came to pick up at 2 pm, it was not ready, a antibiotic drops, and a cough syrup. Told me to come at 3 pm, and I am there now at 6 pm, its NOT READY. SERIOUSLY, First they couldn't find the order, then they said OR it is sent my FAX, and NOW NO MEDICINE. Talked to CJ , Manager, and finally found the MED. UNPROFESSIONAL.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I've been to more CrossFit gyms than I can count and this may very well be my absolute favorite. It's the epitome of what a CrossFit gym should be: a warm and welcoming community, excellent coaching, and a kick-butt facility. Keep it up CCCF!<//Text>< pictures>

Clean, friendly, knowledgeable is how I describe this gym. Classes are on time and one hour. Plenty of equipment to go around and plenty of Staff/Coaches to help you out if you are new here. Scaled workout for all levels and there is no pressure to do things you are not comfortable doing. Classes are attended by all age and skill levels and everyone is helpful. All you have to do is “try”.<//Review>

I tried multiple CrossFit gyms and kept switching until I found this one. Every CrossFit gym talks about community but this one actually means it. During my first couple of weeks not only were the trainers great and encouraging but to my surprise so were the current members. They didn’t throw me into the workout like all the other gyms they instead focused on teaching me the basics before stepping into a class. Which helped so much in terms of understanding the workouts and how to perform them instead of having to look around and mimic the other members. If you’re looking into trying CrossFit I’d recommend this place 110% it’s in a great location with an even better staff that’s only topped by the people who workout with you.<//Review>

Great gym with challenging workouts, great community and supportive coaches. The combination of the three make it fun and enjoyable each time I go. Special workshops such as strength training, lifting technique and nutrition education have been awesome complements which has allowed me to improve my overall well being!<//Text>

<Text>It's a large, open spaced box that accommodates a lot activities. There are plenty of platforms for weightlifting and CFCC has a sanctioned barbell club (yay!). There are CrossFit classes running almost every hour for most of the day beginning at 5AM. They also offer a mobility class on Thursdays and Yoga on Sundays - but there's a dedicated area for mobility available anytime. The coaches and people are all very friendly and welcoming. The community is great and there are community events/competitions taking place fairly regularly. If you're looking for a place to work out, this place is totally worth it.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c352ca001daf:0x848bcf53629c7339</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I've been involved and around CrossFit for over 10 years and without a doubt CrossFit Crown City is the best gym I've ever been a part of. The community is supportive and welcoming, the facility is top notch and has everything you need from space to equipment and the programming is well thought out with a purpose each day and options for all levels from competitive CrossFit athletes to those just looking to be healthy and live a better life. What I feel really separates this gym is it's coaches. They are professional, experienced and really truly care about the members and their goals, health and day to day experience in each class. Their weekly schedule of class times can accommodate any lifestyle and there are classes 7 days a week. I would recommend if you're considering stopping in to attend the free class at 9AM on Saturdays.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c352ca001daf:0x848bcf53629c7339<//gmapID></record>

Finally, I decided to risk humiliation and try a class at CrossFit Crown City and it was the best decision of my life. Not only did I have a great time, I made some amazing friendships, I proved to myself that I can do anything and I am getting stronger every day.

The coaches are tremendously knowledgeable and genuinely care about how movements are carried out. If there is a movement that you don't know how to do, workouts are scaled until you can do it. The community at CrossFit Crown City is by far one of the most amazing parts, aside from the beautiful facility and well programmed classes. I've made some great friends here who I know will be in my life for years to come.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c352ca001daf:0x848bcf53629c7339< /gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

The best crossfit community in Pasadena. Great coaching,  programming, and Olympic weightlifting in a cozy space. So many options for all levels of fitness. So many awesome members and the best music to keep you moving. Open 7 days a week so there's always options for any lifestyle to get your sweat on. A great place to build friendships, learn from the best, and keep motivated.</Text>

<text>Crown City is an incredible gym and an even more awesome community. The coaches care about you and your growth as an athlete. They take care to scale and adapt the workout to fit your capabilities while still pushing you. The programming is well designed so that you can go 4 to 5 times a week, and it goes in cycles over 8 to 12 weeks so you are working on different skills and lifts in a structured way throughout the year.
I've met the most awesome people who are supportive and challenge me to be my best everyday!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I was intimidated by CrossFit for years before joining thinking it was too intense or I’m not in shape enough to do the classes. Now I look back and wish I had joined years ago. The coaches and members are incredibly helpful. You are taught proper technique to help avoid injury and the members are so kind and supportive as you progress.  You are given multiple options to scale any exercise you don’t feel comfortable with for the workouts. The owner is amazing, he does such a great job at making everyone feel welcome, he puts his whole heart into making the box be everything the members wish for it to be.  I have personally met so many wonderful people that have become great friends and have never enjoyed exercising as I do now.</Review>< pictures>

A beautiful and welcoming facility where people of all ages and backgrounds can feel safe exploring and optimizing their fitness potential. I highly recommend this facility for the knowledge of the coaches, the diversity of the members, and the ability to scale every exercise while having fun and getting fit and challenged in ways you cannot at a regular gym.</Review>

CFCC is by far the best fitness community I've ever been a part of. I've been a member for a little over a year and am continually blown away by how much care the coaches put into their work at the gym, from the workout programming to member events to nutrition and beyond. The community they've built is so supportive, and everyone there pushes each other to be their very best. I can not recommend Crown City enough.</Text>

< review>
I've spent a substantial amount of time at 3 different crossfit gyms and dropped in on many in order to find the perfect blend of community, skillful and knowledgable training, and fun! Crossfit Crown City is it for me! The Olympic lifting customized programming has helped me reach new personal records in the 8 months I've been at the gym. I can also seamlessly jump in on a crossfit class for some conditioning-  in fact I am encouraged to do so to keep my health and training well-rounded. On top of the great atmosphere, there are also various programs the gym introduces to support balanced nutrition, strength training and my personal favorite-community service through philanthropy. All of these are available and open to anyone but there is never any pressure to partake if you're not interested. I especially love this place because in the limited free time I have, it's  a "one stop shop" that supports my health, fitness, social needs, and acts in congruence with my values by supporting its community and genuinely encouraging the best version of its members. It's the playground I've always needed as an adult!< /review>

<Review>Ive been a member and coach at four different gyms in Southern California and none of them compare to Crown City. The coaching is top notch, every coach has years of exprience and knowledge with crossfit. They genuinely care for the members of the gym and are willing to take time to help members develop skills and improve technique. The community at Crown City often get together to do actives outside the gym and many of them have became good friends from it. One thing that stands out for me is how often members and staff post about events and activities on the Facebook members page which helps keeps everyone stay in the loop. Crown City is more than a gym, its community of friends who motivate each other to reach their goals.</Review>< pics>

<Response>None< /Response><text>I recently joined CrossFit Crown City after participating in their 6 week challenge this past summer.  I appreciated their no pressure approach with signing up for a membership.  It also helps that this location is now walking distance from home, but if you need to drive there there's a parking lot and plenty of street parking nearby.  The coaches are awesome!  They are knowledgable and pay attention to your form and capabilities.  They'll suggest scaled movements if you're not quite there yet, but they'll also push you to the next level if they know you can do it.  The members have also been so nice and encouraging.  I always have a good time during and after the WOD.< /text>< user>

<text>I joined Crossfit Crown City after being a member of Equinox for almost 11 years. The results Ive seen from CFCC have been far greater than anything achieved at previous gyms.  There is a level of individual attention that you don't see elsewhere. The coaches are wonderful,  extremely supportive regardless of level. The icing on the cake is the community, what a wonderful group of people! Going to the gym is now typically the best part of my day.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I am so thankful to be apart of the Crown City community. Before I attended my first intro class, I was extremely terrified as I had never stepped into any gym other than your usual 24hr/LA fitness type of gym. All that changed after my first class at Crown City. I was amazed how knowledgable and encouraging the staff and coaches were and not to mention the incredible support I received from the members there. It is so  refreshing to see men and women encourage each other and know that they actually care and support one another. I love that I am able to get some good strength training/cardio that pushes me both mentally and physically. This gym never excludes anyone, no matter your fitness level they will incorporate a workout that you can do but that will challenge you as well.   If you're in the area and thinking about stopping by, do it. I highly would recommend it!< /text>< pics>

If you are looking for a great way to get in great condition, do your strength training and cardio in less than an hour in a supportive community environment then CFCC is an excellent choice.  I have been a going to this box close to 5 years.  I can’t see my life with out this place.  My wife and I train together here and every one know our kids. It is definitely a family.  The programming has something for all levels from beginner to competition.  The location is convenient and beautiful too.  It is not just an empty warehouse but a well layed out, clean gym with loads of craftsmanship.

Please know that this box is welcoming and inclusive.  There is no need to be intimidated.  Over the years I have witnessed some amazing physical transformations including that of my wife and myself.  If you try it and stick with it, you too will love the changes.

It is also an excellent box to drop into when traveling.< /Review>

<Review>After several attempts of finding a crossfit gym in the area, I checked out Crown City as a last-ditch effort.  I met JB who had me tryout a class and explained the different options the gym offered.  That was a few months ago and I've been here just about everyday since. Great gym and community.<//Review><resp>None<//resp></record>

CFCC is a great place to workout at. Everybody is friendly, the coaches are very knowledgeable (if you're hurt or can't do a movement they will find a modification for you) and you get a real sense of a community feel. The gym has a calendar of events to keep the gym more interesting. Such as a Halloween wod, beach wods, Park wods, different seminars to work on a weakness and of course a bingo game! It's more than just a place to workout but you also make life long friends as well. And bonus, there are also a lot of great places to eat nearby!<//review>

I have been a member for 3 years now. Crown City has a great facility and a perfect location just south of Old Town Pasadena. My work schedule is sporadic so I needed to find a crossfit affiliate in the area with a schedule that would work for me, they have classes beginning at 5am going all the way till 7:30pm.<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1572543090282, 'text': 'From one Masters athlete to another, thank you for choosing Crown City!'}<//response><text>From a Masters athlete perspective, CFCC has all the attributes one should look for in a CrossFit box. Location, coaches and a great community. Jb - the owner - has built a great atmosphere where you can successfully train for whatever you want in life (whether losing weight, general physical preparedness, or having a base level of fitness for a half-ironman).

When my last box closed, I needed to find a gym that had a strong community with thoughtful & deliberate CF programming with observable strength cycles along with the conditioning. Well, I got what I asked for...at that point I had crossfitted 4.5 years and the change in programming brought a new level of sore that has benefited me tremendously. Very specific strength cycles. A separate Olympic weightlifing program/team.
Gains for me came across the board - I am stronger & fitter than I have ever been. I would highly recommend CFCC.<//text><Date>1542655823060</Date><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_id>117973662371256203971</user_id><user_name>Stephan Boulanger</user_name><gmap_id>0x80c2c352ca001daf:0x848bcf53629c7339<//gmap_id><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Excellent Crossfit gym! The size of the gym is huge compared to other CF gyms in the area. Coaches are super friendly and very knowledgeable. I have been a member for 1.5 year now and love my 6am class. If you want to find out what the Crossfit community is all about, this is definitely the place to start!< /Text>

I recently moved from Houston, Tx and was so lucky to find Crossfit Crown City. Not only do they have great programming and coaching but the CFCC community is amazing! They were incredibly welcoming and always have fun events. If you are looking for a new box or are new to crossfit, definitely give Crown City a try...it won't take long until you are hooked!< /Review>

<review>Its simple. Crossfit Crown City has changed my life. Not in some dramatic way where I lost 100 lbs or came back from the brink of disease, but in a more subtle and approachable way. On paper im a pretty average fellow. I work fulltime, I got bills, family, other hobbies and obligations. Im not a super athlete but I have always tried to keep in shape and Ive always had dreams for my fitness. I worked out for years in cycles of committed attempts at bodybuilding programs only to lose steam, focus, and motivation. Not to mention a general lack of a healthy and realistic relationship to fitness. Ide go months on and months off. I hated the uncleanliness, monotony and judgement I felt  in the standard globo-gym. I felt interested in crossfit, but felt it was only for intense athletes and for the wealthy.

Finally one day I tried out Crossfit Crown City. Immediately I knew nothing would be the same. JB, the owner, was not pushy like I expected him to be. To the contrary he was nothing but pleasant, warm and inviting. He didn't try to sell me anything. He simply seemed interested in showing me what the gym was all about. After knowing him for a couple years now my respect for him as an owner has only grown exponentially. Ive never met a single person who cares more about his business and passion as JB. He always is looking for ways to improve the gym and bring more to its members whether it be new equipment, community social events, programs to spark motivation and balance, or simply words of encouragement and a sincere appreciation for his clients.

So from day 1 JB showed me what the gym was all about. To put it simply: Community and Personal development. Growing as an individual in strength, fitness, general mindset and developing a realistic relationship with fitness by checking the ego at the door, and focusing on truly learning where you stand, safe and proper form, and a real plan to achieve my goals. All while being supported by knowledgeable and approachable coaches that I can truly call my friends and an amazing family of people that are happy to see me and I them. Ive made better and deeper friendships through this gym than in most of my adult life, bc we all push through difficulty together and share a similar mindset of growth and community. Its like a tribe here. Something you dont just go to, to workout in crowded superficial solitude, but to legitimately be a part of something meaningful.

And thats what I mean about how Crossfit Crown City has changed my life. Its improved my relationship to fitness. Ive worked consistently towards goals and have made more gains here in months than in literally years elsewhere. I feel comfortable and truly part of a caring, postive, non-toxic community that pushes me to be better at life, not just my fitness. Its helped me better balance my life with nutrition, sleep, work, fitness, and social connection. I truly will never go back to a regular gym ever again and I am already sad for the day I ever have to leave Crossfit Crown City. I hope that day is nothing but years and years away.

If you have reservations like I did, whether it be intimidated by the sport, the cost, or anything else, I say dont be. I was too, but it was the best decision Ive made in years.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I am new member here at CFCC, having joined from another Crossfit box in the area. It has been a seamless transition for me. I enjoy the new schedule (lots of classes throughout the day to make getting in the box easy with a busy schedule). One of the things that has attracted me to Crossfit from the beginning aside from the great workout you'll get is the community. CFCC does not disappoint. From the coaches to the members, everyone has been extremely welcoming and encouraging. It's a fun place to get your sweat on. The workouts have all been challenging (in a good way), and easily scaled to anyone's ability. I highly recommend.<//review>

I’ve been a part of CFCC for a little over a year and I can say without a doubt that CFCC is incredible. The programming and the facilities are top notch, but the community is what sets it apart. I know that there is an intimidation factor when people hear Crossfit, but I felt welcomed the moment I walked in. JB was quick to respond when I inquired about joining. The coaches are knowledgeable, supportive, and attentive to helping each member grow. I have hit personal bests and am in better shape, mentally and physically.

In closing, CFCC is a great community, there are lots of classes offered during day, programming, Olympic lifting cycles, competitions, and social events. Check them out!<//text>

An amazing group of coaches and a nice facility. I cannot say enough about how dedicated, kind, motivated and strong they all are. As someone who is not athletic and feels awkward in a gym setting, they have worked with me and made me feel comfortable and motivated to continue with crossfit! I cannot thank them enough or imagine going anywhere else. Highly recommend this gym, I’ve heard so many memebers who have tried other CrossFit gyms say this one is by far the best and has trainers who truly care about you and ensure you do things the right way to avoid injurity, I could not agree more.  A special thanks to all of them!</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Resp>None<//Resp><review>I have been working out at the CrossFit gym in Detroit since January 2018. I was visiting Pasadena for a few days, and decided to work out at this gym since it was close to my hotel and seemed to offer the bootcamp style classes that I do in Detroit. I went to this gym Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. Sunday was a bootcamp style class that included a 1.6 mile run (broken up by 400m) and other moves. Michelle was very nice and engaged me in conversation, encouraging me to come back. Monday and Tuesday the classes I attended had a weightlifting component and then more of a bootcamp/conditioning component. I have never lifted weights before, and Cody and Javi were very helpful and accommodating in helping me and modifying some of the workouts for me. I wish the gym space itself was bigger--there were no locker rooms to change or anything, which is what I am used to in Detroit. But I am very happy with my experience  here. All of the trainers that I worked with, 3 in total, were very nice and attentive. I would definitely come back if I am ever back in town. Thanks CrossFit Crown City!< /review>< username>

Thank goodness for the coachs’ enthusiasm, encouragement and persistence!  After occasionally peeking in over several months, I’ve started attending regularly and am better off in all ways - better endurance and strength and more fun with and connection to others at CFCC.  I never considered anything like Crossfit to be for me.  It’s definitely the group and the box leadership (Hey, JB!) that make all the difference.</Text>

- Coaches: The owner, JB, and the rest of the coaches genuinely care about the members and are constantly striving to improve their experience and promote a sense of community. The quality of the programming and the coaching staff is what makes CFCC unique. The coaches are very welcoming, encouraging, and has a unique ability in understanding each member's needs, strengths, and limitations to better assist them in reaching not only their fitness goals but also their personal goals in life. Everyone has an outgoing, upbeat, and a positive personality that enables them to establish a strong, meaningful relation with the members. They are all very approachable and easy to relate with that it is easy for members to discuss both their fitness and personal concerns, fears, and aspirations in life with them without feeling judged in the process. In terms of experiences, the coaches are very knowledgeable and have an extensive background in not only coaching but also special focus areas such as gymnastics and Olympic weightlifting. In addition, the coaches also have a medical background so you can ensure that they are always considering the available research, safety, and your needs in the process on a daily basis. There is no such thing as too hard or too easy as the coaches have such a good relation with the members that they are always able to find a way to challenge them so that they are progressing. I started CrossFit at 150 lbs at 13% body fat and currently I am 180 lbs at 7% body fat. A big part of progress is due to the excellent programming at CFCC as well as the coaching staff to guide me along the way.

-  Environment: The moment you walk into the building, you will be amazed at the size of the facility and all the equipment that it contains. Even with the amount of equipment in the facility, there is still a lot of space. In case you need to visualize the size of it, there is enough room in the facility to run four classes of 10 to 15 people simultaneously (three in the main building and one in the back lot). Equipment are regularly replaced to ensure that the members always have access to high-quality resources.

-    Community: The larger the box, the more likely it is for clichés to form and for members not to be as close to one another. However, CFCC is a rare case as it is a large box, but it does not have any of those issues. At CFCC, both the coaches and members welcome all fitness levels as we believe each individual has unique experiences to contribute. This is mainly due to the management of the co-owner, JB, who operates this box with the value of individuality, acceptance, and community that have become the core values of CFCC.  All of the members at CFCC are very welcoming, supportive, and approachable. Everyone greets one another as they walk into the gym and says their bye as they walk out. Everyone supports, cheers, and encourages one another to improve themselves not only during a workout but also outside of the gym. The members at this facility have become one of my primary support network and my second family that I trust wholeheartedly and rely on for assistance when I need help outside of the gym. A lot of the members are at the peak of their careers ranging from nurses to orthopedic surgeons to therapists (a majority of the members are medical professionals) that are more than willing to help that makes CFCC so unique. On a daily basis, I always look forward to working out with the community and enjoy seeing the comradery of them cheering each other on during a workout. A lot of the members are at the peak of their careers ranging from nurses to orthopedic surgeons to therapists (a majority of the members are medical professionals) that are more than willing to help.

As descriptive as my review was, the best way to truly understand what a gym is like is to come and experience it for yourself. CFCC does offer a free trial for those that are on the edge of trying. I can guarantee you'll be having fun and making life-long friends along the way.</text>

I was so wonder! It’s so nice hotel for that price. Rooms are small but it’s organized. Clean, nice. You don’t need to wait hot water in bathroom how in other 4 stars hotels. Good location. Stores and restaurants are close by. Room service is every day with towels change. It’s so surprise for that kind of hotel.<//Text>

Stayed here for 3 nights. Good quality for what you pay and friendly owners. Location is great, there is a safe, ironing board, fridge. Thick towels, soap etc. Parking is $ 15,- per night, at one of 11 spots ar the gas station 2 minutes away. Would recommend this hotel just a city trip.<//Text>

Although a little small this hotel was far the cleanest and well put together that I've ever been to. As soon as you enter the room you get that sweet clean smell bathroom,  bed sheets were on point. You even got free Netflix, hulu and other entertainment apps to watch. The owner Davang was the true mean of customer service. He went out of his way to actually show us the room before purchasing. The photos of the room on website are exactly how the room is. I'll definitely be staying there again< /Text>

Close to the Hollywood Bowl and an easy walk if you're staying local for a concert.  Very nice family run hotel.  We had a two room suite with a Jack and Jill bathroom.  It was nice to have some space from the kids.  Great price when comparing to other local hotels.<//text>

< review>
Its been almost a year that i visited this hotel!To be honest it was a great decent hotel for 1-3 people.Bathrooms were clean,bed was clean,nice small space that wont make you feel claustrophobic,and its close to the Hollywood walk of fame that you can even walk there.I give it a 4/5 because the only con was it didn't have an elevator so if you have big luggage then your gonna have to carry them up the stairs but the stairs aren't that far up so its not really a big deal but this hotel expectation was better then i thought so i will definitely book with this hotel again when i go back to LA.< /review>

Two bedroom suite with jack and Jill bathroom.  Rooms very clean.  Great location, walking distance to hollywood walk of fame,CVS and restaurants.  Parking close, weird it's at a Chevron gas station, but no issues.  I would stay again!</Text>

Affordable. Walking distance to a lot of spots. Clean room. Nice bathroom. Hallway could do with some upgrades. But overall good.  Friendly owners.
Saw Colin Farrell at the cafe across the street. The area is safe. If traveling by your self just be weary of your surroundings. (Female solo traveler)<//Text>

Good location but rooms are dates and crammed. Sheets were old an shredded. Good enough for a night or two. They have a laundry machine but it doesn't really work.

Pros:  Walking distance to the Hollywood walk of fame,  the rooms are updated,  a nice restaurant is steps away and the staff is friendly.
Cons:  There's no elevator or attendant to haul your luggage to the second floor.  The bathroom could have been cleaner,  all of the window screens were in horrible condition.< /Text>< pictures>

It cost me, after "taxes and fees", $226 for two nights.

Is that bad? I think so, for what I got: a small room with an uncomfortable bed (it was like sleeping atop a parenthesis), hairy towels (not just when I checked in, but the next day when maid service replaced the towels ... I'm guessing the maid sheds), hair on the toilet, hair on the sink, hair in the shower. It was just a hairy place. I'm bald; it wasn't mine.

Have you ever seen "Drive", with Ryan Gosling? You know, after the botched heist where the girl's husband gets killed, and our "hero" and the buxom chick from "Mad Men" retreat to a motel, where she is promptly dispatched and Gosling has to do some murder? That motel is what this place reminded me of. It was a sickening shade of green and, simply, not very inviting.

I had no idea Hollywood was so ghetto, before I saw it firsthand, but now I do know. This hotel befits the neighborhood.<//review>

<Text>I spent here 7 nights. It was okay, because it was relatively cheap, the public transportation was close and some of the attractions of Hollywood were also nearby. I could walk to the Hollywood sign or the Griffith Observatory in an hour. The Walk of Fame was just about 3 corners away. If you want to buy some food or drink, there are some shops just around the corner, but there is no service at all at the hotel. The room was always cleaned, the bed was always made and I got fresh towels and toiletries every day. The room was well equipped: TV, safe, alarm clock, iron, hair dryer, AC...etc were in the room. On the other hand, the noise level was a bit high. There is a busy road nearby which causes a lot of noise. The walls are very thin, so you hear if someone is walking on the corridor or in the room above you. My room did not have any view. There were windows but all I could see was a parking lot. There is a food smell on the corridor (which is not disturbing, but it is strange). The only way to get food or drink is the shops nearby. There is a vending machine at the reception, but it is very expensive.

Overall: If you come to Los Angeles, to do stuff around the city, this is a good place. For sleeping and bathroom it is very good and it is at a reasonable price point. I prefer these places, because I usually just want to have a place to sleep and take a decent shower in a private and clean place. If you come to LA to enjoy hotel services, enjoy the view, have a bar in your room and other fancy things, you might search for another place.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<username>David Lopez<//username><text>Not even worth the 1 star! Horrible experience! The first ordeal was that we had to park our rental car across the street at the Chevron, and walk across 6 lanes of traffic to get to the hotel at a dangerous intersection. The owner of the hotel has an illegal deal going on at the Chevron, and makes you pay $30 cash only for a handmade parking permit. After we were inside the hotel, and lugged our luggage up the stairs, the first thing that hits you is the atrocious smell. The family lives in the hotel, and their ethnic style of food was potent throughout the entire building. It smelt like stale curry.

As we opened the door to our room, we were dumbfounded. The pictures of the room on the booking site completely, inaccurately depict the dwarfish rooms at this hotel. I wasn't expecting a grand suite; all I wanted was a place to sleep and shower. I did not want to spend my birthday vacation however, in a water closet! The room was a third of the size of my bedroom at home, including the bathroom area!

The toilet was probably 12 inches away from the sink and the bathtub was dingy with dirty rings around the bottom of the drain.
Our view from our room, overlooked a lovely junkyard of cars and trash in a old, dilapidated parking lot. This would be a more logical place for your guests to park, asides from trying to dodge traffic on a part of the street that does not have a cross walk!

We gathered our belongings and proceeded to the lobby to explain our disappointment, and wanted to go elsewhere. My girlfriend was not belligerent to the owner in anyway, and just simply asked for a refund and we'd be on our way. First he says he's keeping the $30 parking fee, even though we were only at the hotel for a half an hour. Then he says he's keeping $15. Then he says he will refund the money to our card, which is funny because he specifically asked for the permit to be paid in cash, because of the obvious illegal deal going on at Chevron. My girlfriend caught him in this mistake, and he obliged to pay back that portion in cash. As for our room charges; we were planning to stay two nights, which would have been close to $300. He says he would cut us a break and refund HALF of our money, and forgive my girlfriend for saying such rude things to his wife. WHAT?!!! First of all, why is he obligated to keep what ever money he seems fit, even though we did not stay more than a half an hour? Second, his wife was a very sweet lady, who unfortunately married a lunatic; and my girlfriend never said such "mean" things to her. All she did was ask for ice in our ice bucket, because there were no ice machines in the hotel.

During the argument over the charges, he tells his wife to go clean the room because "we" both used the restroom. How did he know we both used the restroom? Sorry for having natural human needs to pee after a long flight and a long drive looking for your smelly hotel! Also, he tells my girlfriend, why don't you just go to the Holiday Inn then? How did he know my girlfriend and I discussed going there? He was listening to our conversation behind the door, that's why!!!
In the end, we did go to the Holiday Inn in Burbank, and had a spacious, clean room, with wonderful room service and friendly employees that took care of us.

Stay away from here, and go someplace nicer; which will make you happier, and less stressed during your vacation.<//text><userid>116841526221694440664</userid>< gmap_id>

This place is NOT worth staying at! It shouldn’t even get one star. I called and asked if they had any rooms available and a young man said yes. He would reserve one for me that i was on my way I’d be there in 5 mins. My friend that lives in the area helped me bring my luggage in once i arrived. There was a women at the front desk instead of the young man that i talked to and i had told her that i called and spoke to him that Behind her was my name written on a piece of paper for a room that was reserved for me. It was just myself that needed the room not my friend. As if i was lying to her?! They started talking in a different launguage other than English and looked my friend and i up and down and told us that the room was all of a sudden booked online by someone else that it was no longer available, to take our business else where. TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL! I’m not sure if it was the way i looked because I’m a heavily tattooed Caucasian female and my friend was a heavily tattooed African American male. However, all i know was it was uncalled for and not a good first impression to my first time in California. I don’t not recommend going to this hotel.<//review>

Nice quiant place, not far from Hollywood blvd. If you rent a car
(no need to just use Lyft) there is a fee to park (understandably), its not on premises and pricey. There are many steps to go up & to where the main rooms are, I don't know if there were any rooms on first floor. Close to a nice breakfast spot.<//review>

This is probably the best value for money you will get in Hollywood.. It's in walking distance of most stuff, and is generally cheaper than the other options, the hotel it self is decent</Review>

I'd recommend sleeping in your car or on a park bench before staying here. Parking situation was a joke. $15 to park at a gas station across a busy street. Power goes out in our room until after 2am, so no AC in the furnace of a room. After sweating my @ss off all night, I ask the front desk in the morning what can be done, instead of apologizing for the issue, or the fact that they have no back up lights and we almost fell in the stairs because we only had our phones to light the way, the rude man at the desk just says "not my problem" and blames it on the city. Terrible customer service, terrible hotel. Never stay here, unless you enjoy paying good money to sleep on a concrete slab, possibly get bed bugs, AIDS, and stabbed or shot.< /text>

<Text>My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at the trylon.  The rooms are small, but certainly adequate.  Very clean, hardwood floors, air conditioning, flat screen tv and refrigerator.  Yes, and very, very quiet.  being that  it is family owned (reminded me much of an Italian pension),   You did not have the normal hotel traffic, yet you were in walking distance of the Hollywood Walk of fame and other attractions.  A very friendly environment.  My granddaughter after graduation has decided to stay in LA to pursue her career.  Any future visits our stay will be at Trylon Hotel.   Victoria</Text></record>

Giving 5 stars based on how amazing and friendly the staff is, as well as the rooms, the rooms are very clean and updated! Also the location is great, just a few blocks away from Hollywood Blvd. We really enjoyed our stay :-)<//review>

Room was small and parking was a block away. Then parking is an added 15 dollars cash only but he said he'll accept my card. Not easy to see from the street as in there's no turn in parking to check in  just a loading and unloading curbside space that you dont know about until you check in. Small room but only slept here for 1 night so was fine otherwise. Plumbing is pretty bad as pipes run through the night aswell after you flush the toilet and walls are thin.</Text>

<review>UPDATE 8/16/17...The hotel called me and refunded the money for our stay. So I gave them a star for that.

Do you enjoy sleeping on concrete? If you answered yes, this hotel is for you. You will love their beds.
Do you enjoy leaving your car in a sketchy neighborhood with no security?
If you answered yes, this hotel is for you. You will actually pay to leave your car at a Chevron 2 blocks away.
Do you bring your own  flashlights everywhere in case of loss of power for hours?
If you answered yes this hotel is for you. They lose power for hours at a time, you will have to find your way in the dark, shower in the dark, everything in the dark. Don't think about tv or air conditioning, those things require...you guessed it...electricity!!
Are you able to carry your belongings for blocks in case you can't park anywhere near your hotel? You guessed it, you are made for the Trylon Hotel. In case of street construction, no one will offer you help with your bags since you can't even pull up in front of the hotel.
winner, winner, chicken dinner.
And if you complain, they will not apologize or discount your stay, but point out who is to blame. So at least you know whose fault it is that this hotel sucks.< /review>< user>

<Review>Don't stay here  This place is not good. The parking lot is two blocks away, no security is at the parking lot and the parking lot is not in a good neighbourhood. That's not where you want to park your car overnight. The concierge tried to copy the driver's license and the credit card. If you are staying here, you are risking identity theft.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Well what can I say. I will not tay there again.  On the website they say thay the have parking. Well they charge you 15.00 a day and you have to park down the street. You have to cross two stop lights and walk up half a block to park ar as Cheveron gas staion. When you have kids ane alot to carry it`s a pain in the you know what.
Then in the bathroom the shower curtain was mildewed all on the bottom we had to call them to have them change it. The bath tub was old and crappy.
The thing i hated was the fire alarm in our room kept going off they changed the batteries but it kept going off. It was so annpying. Thats why I will not stay thete again.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Hands off!!!
We got a huge shock on our arrival. As a precaution, I always disinfect the toilet, here was the cloth after wiping brown (see picture) to were hair in bed. Wanted to go, but then after a complaint got another room, where my toilet - test was positive but the later, closer look you saw, that this room was not really clean. We checked in on our tour in 16 motels and hotels. But we have not gotten that yet. No idea what the staff does all day, but not cleaned here.

(Original)
Finger weg!!!
Wir haben bei unserer Ankunft einen riesen Schock bekommen. Zur Vorsorge desinfiziere ich immer das WC, hier war das Tuch nach dem abwischen braun (siehe Bild) dazu waren Haare im Bett. Wollten eigentlich gehen, aber haben dann nach einer Beschwerde ein anderes Zimmer bekommen, wo mein WC - Test zwar positiv war aber beim späteren, genaueren hinsehen sah man, dass auch dieses Zimmer nicht wirklich sauber war. Wir haben auf unserer Rundreise in 16 Motels und Hotels eingecheckt. Aber sowas ist uns noch nicht untergekommen. Keine Ahnung was das Personal den ganzen Tag macht, aber geputzt wird hier nicht.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) We stayed at this hotel for 2 days. It was a disaster!!! When we entered our room, we met the shock !!
It was pretty clear that someone was in our room just before. The bed wasn't made. A hot coffee was still on the bedside table and sugar was strewn on the floor. The towels were wet on the bathroom floor. In addition, it was about 30 degrees and the air conditioning did not work. The hotel room was labeled as a non-smoking room, but it smelled awful of stale smoke! The best thing was when we complained about the dirty room, someone from the staff took us to the cleaning cupboard and told us we could clean ourselves! The only good thing was the location. is about 10 minutes from the Walk of Fame.

(Original)
Wir waren 2 Tage in diesem Hotel. Es war eine Katastrophe!!! Als wir unser Zimmer betreten haben, traf und der schock!!
Es war zimlich klar das gerade vorher noch jemand in unserem Zimmer war. Das Bett war nicht gemacht. Ein heisser Kaffe war noch auf dem Nachttisch und zucker war am Boden verstreut. Die Tücher waren nass am Boden im Badezimmer. Ausserdem war es etwa 30 grad und die Klimaanlage funktionierte nicht. Das Hotel Zimmer wurde als nicht Raucher Zimmer betitelt, aber es roch fürchterlich nach abgestandenem Rauch!!! Das beste war, als wir wegen dem dreckigem Zimmer reklamiert haben, führte uns jemand vom Personal zum Putzschrank und sagte uns wir können selber putzen!! Das einzig gute war die Lage. ist etwa 10 min vom Walk of Fame entfernt.< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) + The hotel is not far from the freeway and easily accessible. It was relatively clean, safe, coffee maker, hair dryer available. Staff was nice. The hotel is in a great location for tourists, only 2 blocks from the Walk of Fame, not far from the Griffith Observatory

- The air conditioning was not that clean, the view from the back yard was scary, better to close the curtains! (certainly depending on the room)
For $ 15 per day you can park on the opposite side of the gas station, can you only pay CASH, is it possible to do this with the right things?
These hotels are badly soundproofed, you know that beforehand!

(Original)
+ Das Hotel ist vom Freeway nicht weit entfernt und gut zu erreichen. Es war relativ sauber, Safe, Kaffeemaschine, Föhn vorhanden. Personal war nett. Das Hotel hat für Touristen eine tolle Lage, nur 2 Blocks vom Walk of Fame entfernt, nicht weit bis zum Griffith Observatiorium

- Die Klimaanlage war nicht der sauber, der Ausblick aus dem Hinterhof war gruselig, lieber Gardine zu! (sicherlich zimmerabhängig)
Für 15$ pro Tag darf man auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite auf dem Tankstellengelände parken, darf man nur CASH bezahlen, ob das mit rechten Dingen zu geht?
Hellhörig sind diese Hotels ja alle, das weiß man vorher!</Review>

(Translated by Google) It's a Las Vegas hotel that smells like tobacco and vice, it has the casino downstairs. Connect with the Luxor and it's on the Strip.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Called  today to get my phone battery replaced on my Nokia 6. I've been to this location a few times in the past probably four or five years ago and I've never had any issues with their phone repairs. I called in the morning on such short notice and they were able to get to me quick and my phone battery replaced in less than an hour.. I was so happy that they could take care of this today and I went to another shop and they didn't have the confidence level to fix my phone and I didn't feel comfortable with them and I came back here again. I'm very confident with their phone repairs and their pricing is very reasonable and fair. In the future I'm just going to use this shop as my go-to shop for now on for phone repairs. If you guys are looking to replace your battery fix your screen etc you will have no problem coming here to get your phone needs fixed. I feel confident in their work and you should have no problems leaving your phones here for repair. Great shop and the owner is a nice guy and bring your future phone needs here. Thanks guys at CPR for taking care of me this morning it was such a huge relief to get this phone fixed. You guys will be my go-to shop for as long as you guys are in business here. Again thanks a lot 👍😄</Review>< Pictures>

They were great! I took my old toshiba laptop in to have a hinge issue fixed. They were able to fix my laptop within a day of receiving the parts. I also needed a laptop charger and the owner let me borrow one of his for a few days until I could buy my own on Amazon! They went above and beyond! 10/10!</review>

I am very disappointed by the type of repair service they did to my iphone X. They said it’s free diagnosis but after opening the phone i was charged non-refundable $40 for so-called  cleaning even before confirming any damage. After cleaning i was told screen is damaged. They even offered a broken screen for $80 and recommended screen protector for additional $40 which I refused (so funny). After changing  the cheapest  new screen on the market (as per their words) for $120 again battery damage was diagnosed. I felt like I was in a money trap. I spend $210 in total and after coming back to home I realized the screen is not fitted properly. It still moves up and down seems like something is broken while repairing. Now I realized I should have bought another refurbished iphone X online (for $245 to $315 in amazon and other sites). I recommend everyone to stay away from this place.</text>

{'time': 1619632467917, 'text': "I'm truly sorry you had a negative experience. You brought your phone in with water damage, and it was not turning on at all.  The $40 we charged was for a water damage cleanup, nothing to do with our free diagnosis. We were successful in getting your phone to turn back on, which the majority of our customers would appreciate. However your screen and battery were damaged when you got the phone wet. We told you how much it would cost to replace these components, and you told us to proceed.  You could have refused the repair at any time if you chose to do so.  We had your phone in perfect working condition when we handed it back to you, with all your data intact!  If you still feel something wasn't done right, we offer a warranty for ALL repairs we do, and we would be happy to redo anything you're not fully satisfied with.  Thank you."}< /resp>

Juda and his team were so personable and friendly. He genuinely cared to make sure that I was 100% satisfied with his work. His prices are affordable and he made my experience getting my screen replaced somehow easy. If you sadly crack your screen or have any other tech issues, check this place out. Thanks again Juda!< /review>

<text>I am a business owner and I pretty much run my business from my cell phone. Well....This morning I dropped a weight on it during my workout and it completely blacked out my screen. I was able to drop my phone off and have the screen completely repaired and back in business within 2 hours of the time I broke my screen. What a relief! Clean shop, very responsive, top notch workmanship. Everything you should expect from a business. Thank you!</text>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Great, professional, and friendly customer service!!  CPR is the ONE and ONLY shop to get any repairs done right in Cypress.

I had a bad iPhone battery, and their first time estimate was about 30 min, but they were done in like 10-15 min; you didn't feel any wait time at all.

CPR knows what they're talking about, and they never waste the customer's time; if then can't fix it, then they'll let you know right away.</Text>< Pics>

I took my Iphone7+ in today because I had cracked the screen, as well as my rear camera had stopped working. They were able to replace the screen and camera within 1.5hrs. They did an amazing job!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>The owner was professional in dealing with clients. But rather they are overprized and not really fixing the problem with the phone. First to change the screen of samsung J7 $100 and then they told me they have to change the battery of my phone Samsung J7 for additional $40. I have paid $140 and the phone is not charging the whole 24hours so I have to return the next morning. They said they change the battery and did not even check if the phone is getting charged or not, I paid extra for nothing. It was not done. The next morning, it was not done , I have to return for another 1 hour and the owner told me it is charging but very slow and he told me he fix it for free, really?
I am not sure if their technician is sabotaging the business and does not have a knowledge of  properly fixing phone.
No concern for my time, gas and effort.
I told them to update me with the status of the repair by email and I did not get one.
Now my phone is not fixed properly, and when someone calls me they could not properly hear me.
It is a decent place but your technician in Cypress is sabotaging the business, be sure to make them accountable.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Affordable and great service!

Update: I wrote this post immediately after receiving my cell phone before going home and really inspecting/trying it out. My bad. First, I got my a new battery and a new home button on my iPhone 7 Plus. When I returned home I was so excited my phone would turn on it took me a while to realize my phone would t charge anymore. The only time it charges is when I manually shut it down and keep it off while it chargers. The home button is ridiculously finicky even with settings put to the least sensitive it could be and since the moment I got home my Touch ID no longer works so going to trade in my phone is not even a option because one it doesn’t charge, two on the screen every time you open it, it alerts you that Touch ID isn’t working on this device.. but even more then that the whole home screen button started popping out about a week after having it back from them replace it .  So half the time my home button is sticking halfway out attached by this one string on the left hand side. Super bummed.<//Text>

I have an older model of the iPhone and the battery life was diminishing at an accelerated rate. Called CPR because Apple put me on eternal hold and CPR told that they could replace the battery for a nominal charge. Dropped my phone off before lunch and picked it up after lunch. The turnaround time for battery replacement is excellent. I highly recommend them for phone repair.</review>

CPR (Cypress, CA) saved the day. They changed my cracked screen for the Sony Xperia. No one in LA knows how or wants to work on it. The alternative was to send to Sony service depot in Indiana. If that is the case, the phone will be out of commission for at least a week. May as well trash the phone and buy new one.<//review>

I had trouble getting my computer back before we left town. It didn't work right, and a nongenuine version of Windows was installed on it. Try somewhere else.< /review>

<review>I would give zero star if there's an option. When I went in, they told me that I only need to pay if they fix the phone. However, after waiting for a few days, they didn't fix my phone. Worse yet, they still charged me even though they didn't fix it! Therefore, their capability of phone repair is questionable. In addition, they don't hold their promises. Go to the store at your own risk.</review>< Pics>

(This happy approx. 2-3 years ago). Someone else got my phone and contact info...the "repaired" phone that I received does not work.   Very untrustworthy place.  Regret going there.  The person who got my phone contacted me which very much concerned me.</text>

Great service! Quick and reliable! Got my Android Samsung phone up and working again same day for a seriously good price. Tania, the cute girl behind the counter was very nice and straight to the point. Highly recommended! Try this place out for yourself see their handy work first hand before passing this place up over a few internet reviews.< /text>

CPR helped me fix the screen on my Samsung galaxy 5. Even though they were very busy on that day they got it done within 4 hours. Their price was at least $20 cheaper than everyone else I called. Very professional service.<//review>

WARNING DO Not go there, I went to fix my Moto g I paid em and they told me they will fix it, went back again and told me they could not fix it, when I came back to pick it up they told my phone can not be fixed and the owner gave me the worst attitude ever. I will never go there again and I recommend no one to go there, plus the price is really expensive.<//text>

The service tech who installed my curved elite glass cover did a great job, BOTH TIMES!  I'm sorry I didnt catch his name, hes the only Asian gentleman in the store... the glass cracked, 1st time was 2 months from when purchased (bought in Jun 2018 from Verizon, it was replaced in Aug 2018 at CPR Cypress).  The 2nd time he replaced it was 1 week after also in Aug 2018.  He was good, took his time to get all the bubbles out, it was about 20-30 mins.  He knows how to do the shield installation, no problems with him!

The good thing is this business is an authorized dealer to replace the ZAGG INVISIBLE SHIELD ($50 cost for 1st one), the 2nd and 3rd time I replaced the shield I paid $10 for each replacement (total $20).  I dont like the quality of the shield as I have spent a total of $70 now, they are not the best quality!</Text>

If could give 0 stars I would. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!! DO NOT TRUST!!!

Lies lies lies all around. I took my iPhone 5 in to get a quote on the screen. The owner of the shop took my phone and looked at it personally and tells me to come back in an hour to know the damage.

Without calling me to approve they go ahead and change the screen to the phone. I come back in an hour and they give me a quote of $200 dollars. I say no thank you and have them put the phone back the way it was.

HERE IS THE WORST PART. instead of putting the phone with my original screen, they changed the screen to give me one without the LCD, front camera, sensor, speaker, and all other parts attached to the digitizer!!

The only way I figured this out was by going to another store to have it fixed!</review>

<Text>Came in to fix have my xperia z screen replaced, when picking up my phone i noticed that some parts of my screen and the back glass panel were protruding so i told them and they said that was normal so i let it slide. Coincidentally, the same week the back panel starts coming off where it was protruding and when i take it in all they do is put a little more adhesive where it was coming off. "Surprisingly" the same thing happens like two months later.< /Text><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

This is a warning. Do not go here. They have no idea what they're doing. I went it to get my screen fixed and the gave me a defective screen. Went back to get it fixed again but then something else went wrong with my phone.
They blamed the issue on me and would not admit any fault.
I will never go here again.< /text>

First off, they charged me over 100 dollars for a simple screen replacement. And they gave me the lowest quality screen instead of a good samsung one like i had, and for 100 dollars you would expect to get a good screen right? Not at this place... the big arab guy is the owner and hes a complete douche bag, completely lied to me and told me my LED was out and that he wouldnt charge for a new one. But he just said that to try and make it seem like i was getting a better deal because i was clearly unhappy about the screen quality and the price. I am writing this review now because 1 week later the screen keeps popping up and i completely cant use it at all. I go back and nobody there says they have any records of me and they cant help... its just a complete outrage. I never write reviews and here i am putting out 1000 words on this place, DO NOT GO, save your money, go to the place at the mall instead< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

During my wait (about 15 minutes), I saw customers come in for pick-up and leave happy. The gentleman who was tending to customers at counter was friendly with everyone. Although the opening for the jack on my tablet is smaller than that of an iPad, making it more difficult to retrieve the broken piece, the technician was able to get it out. $35 later (labor fee), I'm happy I can go back to easily swiping payments for my customers.</Review>< Time>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>Took my Asus Transformer Prime TF201 to them for a simple digitizer replacement.  When I got my tablet back it was pristine, and that's where the positives end.
First visit I spoke with a tech casually, because I was nearby, explained the problem precisely, was quoted $150 by Andrew.  Came back on Jan 3 with the written quote, the price had changed to $170.  That's fine, it's not so expensive.  I was told it would take a week.  I told the service tech to be careful, there are two parts that are almost identical, and they won't know which one until they open the device up, and leave after paying my bill.
I call a week later, they've ordered the wrong part.
Next week, same deal again, for about 4 weeks, when they finally seem to have figured out that there are two different parts and nobody in the US has the right one.  Go figure, I told them that when I dropped it off.
I call a few more times and they're waiting on shipping from China.  Okay, not so bad at this point.  I get a call back on March 7 that the repairs are done, and pick it up the same day.
After some hemming and hawing about the long delay, we finally agree to accept a call back from the Manager.  The manager 1) Refuses to admit that there's anything wrong with taking 2 months, 2) Claims he lost man-hours trying to figure out that there were two different parts, and 3) Hangs up on me!  all, 4) after refusing any sort of compensation except the vague notion of ordering a case or charger for us.  After the last thing they ordered, that's the last thing I want is to wait on another delivery.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Fun Fact this is a hidden trick at this PX you can actually take a Riggers Belt and just put it on and leave your MCCAP belt in the store and its totally cool. I used to shop here all the time back in 2008-2012 when i was with 1st Recon. You ARE authorized to tactically conceal anything you want in you're ruck sack or cargo pockets. I also recommend that you chow down while in the PX just make sure you clean up after yourself. Remember its NOT stealing its tactically acquiring what you and you're fellow Marines need. I never had any issues and neither did the other 150 Recon Marines who were with me.<//review>

Great location that caters to a community of Marines and Sailors. There is also a gas station there and the store hours are decent. No complains here</Review>

Some of the employees are unprofessional and will often times not initiate a greeting or say anything during checkout. Items sold are popular quick drinks and snacks and this store offers very little with regards to anything else such as electronics or cleaning supplies.< /Review>

Well, it's a really busy part of town. Disneyland is not far. Our server was great, however they were really busy. The place was a little messy and the floors were really sticky. There was a lot of seating outside though, it was just really loud and crowded. The food we ordered was Wednesday Outback Special. It came with the smallest steak and the thinnest chicken, so I guess you get what you pay for. It was only 10 99.</Review>

The food is always very good. Very casual. No special decor. They should lower the lights a bit for some ambience. Servers and bus personnel are all very nice but service is pretty bad sometimes. Good cocktails and great prices.< /Text>

Food is excellent but usually service is slow with not enough checking back to see if we need refills, salsa... anything.  Staff is polite.< /Review>

It's... Ok. After reading all the reviews about the service I was excited to see what it's all about. Unfortunately we were met with mediocre service and low quality food. The carnitas was extremely dry and seemingly double or triple reheated. The outside was hard and the inside was still very dry, a huge letdown. The beans tasted better than they looked but still werent very good. Overall, a very underwhelming experience.< /Review>

<review>The food here is super yummy, Mexican comfort food. My favorites are the Menudo, refried beans, carnitas, quesadillas, Chile rellenos and dont forget the Micheladas. The only thing is I wish they would do homemade  tortillas.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We have tried several Mexican food restaurants in Orange County, we have yet to find one that out does Tio Chavez. From Albondiga Soup to Chicken tacos simply outstanding. Definitely our favorite place.<//Text>

<review>The worst chorizo and egg burrito I've ever had and the menudo was all right, to the people that like this place you don't know good Mexican food. I gave it 2 stars because the people where so friendly  should of just went to Del Taco not saying that's good Mexican food just would of been more enjoyable and cheaper.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
If you want to experience authentic home style mexican food i would recomend this place to everyone. The mole and steak picado is very delicious. The people are friendly and treat you as a person not a customer. This place has grown in size but the food has not changed. Where i work we cater to everyone who has completes 5yrs of employment and when i get to 5yrs i will ask for Tio Chava to cater for me. Like i said this place is good! Its not like all these other americanize restaurants (albertos -el torito) to name a few.  You dont have to take my word for it. I would say come and taste for yourself.<//Review>

My family has been going to Tio Chavas since they opened in the Stater Bro's center. As of late the food and the cleanliness have gone downhill. Ate there this week for dinner. The rice was burnt, beans were old and the shredded beef in my tacos was way overcooked. My wife had street tacos that had more cilantro than chicken, they looked like cilantro tacos. Every other table was dirty with prior customers plates that remained the entire time we were there. I sure hope it is temporary!  Not eager to return anytime soon.</Text>

Bummer.  My son still needs a hair cut and I have no idea where to take him cuz we just moved here.  ☹😖< /Text>< Pictures>

They do a really good job on your haircut they do take your time you're not rushing like other barber shops however I'm a little confused on the prices when I go there one guy charged me $15 another guy charged me 21 and then the last time I went I was charged $23 nevertheless they live up to your name Excellence when it comes to the haircut really nice guys wish there were just a bit consistent about their price ranges will highly recommend to friends<//Text>

< review>
I’m disappointed at this barbershop because after reading the reviews I decided to bring my son for a haircut.  I showed up 5minutes before opening and was told that the barber would be in at 10:30am.  We waited and at 10:45 was told he was still on his way.  11:01 came in and was told he told he was running late and should be there at 11:30.  Never coming back.<//review>

The morning to do my hair all uneven so I go back and dude isn’t there and the other barber has appointments yet no one was in the shop told me to come back at 11 or after 6  that’s not a good way to do business  I’m sorry nice guys and all but  business is business I wouldn’t recommend this shop !!</Review>< username>

A good place to find hard to find parts for older Euro cars, BMW,s in my case that you need now. Vee parts always seems to come through with random parts I need on the spot. Thanks guys!< /Review>

4th generation vdubber and Vee Parts customer coming up here. The guys at Vee Parts are always super helpful, have gotten me out of a pinch on multiple occasions and their prices are always very competitive with online retailers. I highly recommend them for both your aircooled and watercooled parts needs.< /text>

<review>Pablo and the team here at Vee Parts are fantastic. I’ve been coming here since I was in high school to get Volxwagon parts and accessories. Make sure to check them out before considering spending a ton of money with the dealerships. Best European parts store in National City and San Diego for sure.</review>< name>

I mean you really can't sugarcoat this place. It's a VW Part Store and they sell literally almost anything you could possibly want, down to every minute detail of your restoration along with performance parts at an affordable price.
The staff is extremely knowledgeable, and actually REALLY nice.
I saw a costumer throwing a fit one time over a particular piece he ordered through them (which he ordered the wrong one by the way) and got extremely apprehensive towards the employees. The staff handled it extremely professionally and it was impressive to see.
I come in about once a week because my VW is absolute trash and needs a new part every week, but guess what? They know exactly what it's called, and they carry it.<//text>

Maybe I lucked out for this one time experience. I arrive here at 8pm and I feel like the place was already going to close up for the day considering that it closes at 10pm. The store itself was pretty empty with almost no customers inside as I come in and get a burrito bowl to go with brown rice, no beans, steak, medium salsa, corn, and cheese. The picture posted was the result of that and it looked severely empty for the amount I paid for a bowl. The guy who made my bowl was being extremely conservative with every ingredient I asked for even though the only ingredient they were actually lacking was rice, which there was no more prepared ahead of time. I wanted some chips too but they didn't have any at the time, so I had to accept my fate for whatever this snack could be for dinner. I could give one star out of anger and disappointment, but hopefully, this is just a one time thing.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This is for only the Chipotle Mexican Grill on E. Brokaw in San Jose,CA. HUGE disappointment! Ordered 2 salad bowls, asked for salad dressing and was told by the Mgr. Samantha, they didn't have any and would tak 20 min. to make.  I left thinking ok they''re in process of making more - returned 25 min later with receipt asking for salad dressing and Samantha, with attitude mentioned you said you weren't going to wait for salad dressing so we didn't make more. Then she went on to say they're short handed to she didn't make a second batch which they typically do.  I have been to tons of Chipotle's and NEVER have I not gotten salad dress, needles to say a whole lot of Attitude from so called Mgr.  -->Samantha - rude and unprofessional.  Other customers were shaking their heads in disbelief with her behavior.  Some customers agreed her behavior was unacceptable  as I was calmly asking when salad dressing would be ready - Samantha literally walked away from me, not answering the question, nor acknowledging me as a customer.  Don't waste your time or money - not worth the bitterness Samantha was spewing!</Review>< pics>

So sad to putting this 1-star because I always order from this place a lot and I like the food. I went to pick up an order with my fiancé and they said that DoorDash already pick up the order. The person that serviced us was very dismissive on where our food was. He said that it was DoorDash’s problem, not theirs—then he just walked out and left us there. Note: We ordered pick up, not delivery.

What if the food was picked up by someone else? The staff at Chipotle does not check who picks up an order. They just leave it on the table and any random person can walk in and pick it up. Our food got lost and they didn’t take any responsibility. I am so disappointed. They lost a customer.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>came here today around 11AM and WOW YUM!! seriously best bowl i’ve had from a chipotle in a long time. i actually visited this location because my nearest chipotle keeps disappointing me and i’m so happy i did. DEFINITELY my new spot! can’t wait to come back.

the ladies there are super sweet, and you can tell they care about their job. didn’t catch names but the girl taking temperatures of the food today seriously is a sweetheart and made my day!  YUM!! thanks ladies!< /review>< user_id>

I have had SO many issues with this location at this point. Constant turnover, every time I go here the employees are new.

Came here, ordered. They made my bowl. Get to the cashier and find out they are only accepting cash or online orders today. Does this not seem like something to tell your customers before they order or ideally as they enter so they don't waste their time?</Text>

With the covid restrictions they are taking orders outside which I understand but when they brought my burrito to me it was tiny as heck and tried blaming me saying I need to order extra on the sides if I wanted more which I’ve never had to do before. They fixed it and added extra but forgot the corn. Which was a simply fix I just asked for it on the side. I gave chipotle another chance last night ordering it on the app instead. And they left out the damn corn again which is my favorite part and instead of chicken they put carne asada. Have never been more disappointed. And I love chipotle.<//text>

<Text>Overall really bad experience, I used to come here often but since covid they've gotten much more unorganized. In my most recent experience, they only allowed 4 people in. During this time there were already 3 people not including my s.o and myself in the building. A specific male worker kicked us out, telling us only 4 people and then allowed someone else who had just come by to order and pick up food ahead of 3 other people.

I believe an establishment should maintain their standards even during these times but this chipotle seems to have dropped it's customer service.

In terms of food, usually they're a bit more generous about how much they give you. This one seemed to be a bit behind on their orders and therefore looking to get us out the door. Overall not a good experience and definitely a deserved 1 star.</Text><rate>1< /rate><user_id>118157738907237806259</user_id><GmapID>0x808fcc08e51b7fdb:0x3958fd06e340b4c4< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Burrito bowl: brown rice, black beans, chicken, salsa verde (medium heat), corn, guacamole, lettuce. Chips on the side.
Chipotle is not authentic Mexican food but I always enjoy its fresh flavor. Nachos are not on the menu. I always get a bowl and chips so I can eat it like nachos.<//text>

Great service.   I come here at least once a week.  The staff is always friendly and doing their best effort to satisfy the costumers.

The portions are always good size and my food is always ready on time when I order on line.  Definitely my go to restaurant during lunch hours.</Review>

<Text>On Black Friday, with warm kind spirit, I visited this store to get a to-go. The new employee(I guess) who served food for me was great! She is nice! But the cash register(another lady) was NOT good. She made the wrong bill. I notified her after I checked the receipt. She was unhappy. no any apologize. very un-polite. Finally, she notified the manager and the manager refund me the extra charge.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Our order was for nineteen, which I sent them at 9:30 AM, with a pick up time of 11:45 AM. I called for confirmation, and the person who answered wasn't the friendliest, but I was fine with that. I arrived to pick up the order at 11:43 and was told it would be 5 minutes. I then asked for a soda for while I waited, to be billed with the rest of the order. Our order finally was ready after 12 Noon. The women who came out with our(large & heavy) box of items (she had braces) confirmed everything was there. I noticed the 6 orders of chips & salsa weren't included, and when I asked her about it, she told the cashier to charge me for 1 order of chips and salsa, and "don't forget her soda". While they figured this out, I took our box to my vehicle (not parked too close), and NO ONE offered to help me. Not even the manager guy who was hanging around playing figures on his lap top and overseeing what was happening behind the counter. Really week service and inept to the bargain. By the way, we only received 6 small containers of salsa, after spending over $150. This will be the last time I order our bi-weekly company lunch  from this franchise. They used to be great (they had a different manager). Not anymore!<//Text><Rate>2< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x808fcc08e51b7fdb:0x3958fd06e340b4c4<//Gmap_id><time>1423177249290< /time>< userid>

<Review>I went there on the day of my anniversary as my wife loves Mexican Grills.
They have a nice sitting area facing the East Brokaw Street Indoor and Outdoor. They makes Veggie Bowl in way that once you start eating you do not want to stop. My wife had her own and then turned for mine LOL.

One thing that I didn't like was, While we were having an amazing veggie bowl. An Employee came to close to us and started wiping the floor and he didn't even noticed that he started wiping my shoe. As I can ignore this, I would say their food has made my day.</Review>< Rate>

<gmap_id>0x808fcc08e51b7fdb:0x3958fd06e340b4c4< /gmap_id><Review>This was my favorite place to eat during my lunch hour, it's not to far from my job which makes it super convenient. Well today this Chipotle lost a loyal customer. I came in to grab food to-go for lunch. I placed my order as usual and I felt really rushed but kept moving the pace they forced me to, when I moved to the register I paid for my food and went on my way. I order a bowl with white rice, black beans, mild chili, corn, cheese and guac. I got to work and opened my bowl and my order was wrong. My bowl was doused in sour cream! If it had been enough to scrap off and eat, I would of did just that, but there was no going around the glob of sour cream this girl poured all over my bowl. I had to drive all the way back and ask for my bowl to be remade due to their incompetent employees. I walked up to the register and asked for them to remake it due to it being wrong, the young man advised he would do just that. I got back in line and had to repeat my order twice to the first girl because she acted like she was lost, I asked her to put extra rice and I had no problem paying the difference, she still did not add the extra rice. I then moved to the next girl whom is the one that loves overly drenching food in sour cream, well she messed up my order yet again! Placing the hottest chili Chipotle carries, I told this girl that she was doing it wrong and if she was listening to what I was saying. Then the "Supervisor" intervened feeling like it was okay to step up to me in an aggressive manor yelling at me to stop being "rude" or I can be kicked out. I told this "Supervisor" I was upset because I am a MANAGER of the company I work for and do not have to be making double trips for the mistakes of their employees that could of been avoided if they had listened to me the first time. This "Supervisor" whom I did not get the name of walked to the back of the room but still glaring at me. When I finally got to the register I was approached by a helpful older asian woman who was very apologetic to me for the whole incident and advised me she would comp me for the food and refund me my money. Money is not the problem, I have no issue paying any tab of mine, however if I am paying nearly $10 a bowl you would think we would be getting the correct portion size, seems like now they cut all the portioning, but NOT their prices. At the end of the day my main concern is my time, being a Manager my time is very valuable and incidents like this are things I do not wish to deal with. Again I will NEVER return to this Chipotle and I will be contacting Cooperate in regards to that "Supervisor".< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This Chipotle location is pretty decent and is my go to choice in the area. Portion sizes are good and I've only ever had one employee complain about folding my order. Stop complaining and wrap that little donkey.

Prices (Burrito, Bowl, Tacos, or Salad):
Chicken, Sofritas, Veggie 6.25
Steak, Carnitas, Barbacoa: 6.70

Recommend: Steak burrito with everything in it.</review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>While I am not fan of the way the Salvation Army spends the money this store is one of the only true thrift stores left in Escondido. Most skim their stock for good stuff and either staff takes it to resell or the store does resells online. Here, good deals just end up on shelves. It's lower volume than Valley Parkway's Valley Thrift Store so the resellers are not as thick here, usually. Which again means better stuff for lower prices. The staff is always pleasant and helpful. I enjoy visiting this store and found many cool things there.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Salvation army store is alot like GuitarCenter. They both sell overpriced junk and at the end of the day the only one who benefits is the store. I gaurantee a new music store would get all GC's new business. No one wants to be nickled and dimed into the poor house. RGB Jr</text>

I love this place. I always find furniture for a great price. Everybody who works there are very friendly. Their prices are low already and yet they still give you discounts. I always leave this store feeling happy. This is one of the places I like to donate things that can be useful to other people.< /Text>

<text>For a thrift store, it is very nice and well-kept. I appreciate the calm atmosphere and friendly smiling faces of the associates. I was pleasantly surprised by all of this because other Salvation Army stores I've patronized have been a bit shabby and dirty. Check this place out. You're sure to find a gem!<//text><UserId.>117373222439712518529</UserId.>< date>

< review>
Was shopping here earlier today for men's t shirts and dress shirts. I was waiting in the store for probably 2 hours for the lady to bring new clothing out as she was sorting through it on the back. Then a couple customers come in and go through the t shirts and then one of them is allowed to go into the back of the store by an employee to look through the shirts before they came onto the main floor. I had been waiting for hours for her to bring the shirts out. Very bad experience.They allow certain customers to go into the back and pick through clothing and also the employees of the store and truck drivers. Most of the employees are very kind but it is not right to let people shop in the back of the store.</review>

Great thrift store run by a TRUE charity. The staff is always friendly, especially Randy who always greets you with a smile and bends over backwards to help in any way he can. Selection always changes and prices usually pretty good when you consider the percentage off sales.
Did we mention Randy is cool?< /Review>

<review>First off I have to say thank you for having such a friendly staff on the floor and very helpful. The Nicknack section is wonderful along with houseware. Very clean. I purchased a lovely photo frame mason jars at $1.89 large size in excellent condition. A 4 piece set of plates crate and barrel for 4.00. 2 nice blouses. I would have given a 5 but I  had a young female of maybe 20 light colored skin dark black hair that was very slow and had difficulty using register took to ring up my purchase and wasn't able to make or count correct change. I was given back way to much. I gave it back to her and had her recount it. I realize that we all have to learn and grow. In my opinion she needs some more training behind the scenes before placing in a cashier position for the protection of Salvation Army and also for her own protection. Just wish stores had a public bathroom to use. Posted sign said no public restrooms 😣  I would think about changing policy please🤔</review></record></dataset><record>

Apparently he missed the donation center by 5 minutes (the time on here isn't correct I guess) and was met rudely by the workers there. (Who also didn't mind gossiping in the back instead of helping).

One older gentlemen helped him and I wish we got his name to thank him as a great example for a salvation army worker.

People like the others make one think twice about donating.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>Some Staff members were chatting too much instead of helping the store customers. One older male member just wave his hand when I ask him where the boys clothing are located. Then I ask another  staffer the same question and she could not understand what I was asking about. I had to point to my shirt and emphasize the word "boys" three (3) times before she finally got what I was asking for. She needs then pointed to the proper area and immediately left. She didn't even hear me when I sad, "Thank you." At other stores, they would even accompany you to the exact place where the items you are asking for are located. The female cashier was a different story. She was friendly, cheerful, and helpful. I heard her ask the customer in front of me "How their day was going and if they found everything they were looking for." I suggest retention of the cashier and closer monitoring of the other staff members.</review>< username>

<Review>Good prices, I always find something I can't live without.  Staff is nicer than other nearby thrift stores imho. Harder to donate to, seems the back drop off spot is always clogged with trucks, cars, or bins. But I prefer to donate here because they play K-Love on the radio</Review>< pictures>

Seems there is always an issue at check out with the technology they have chosen to be their check out processes. It's a thrift store and they don't check Ebay and jack up their prices like the place that starts with a G and ends with a Will. But there's always a snafu trying to check out. If you have a little patience you'll be fine.<//review>

Not the cleanest thrift store. Also things stay on the shelves for longer than most I've been in. But great variety of older items. This is the place you want to go for antiques and collectibles. Nice staff also.< /text>

The staff is wonderful, friendly, and helpful  The store is beautiful and well organized.

They seriously need to have their black sharpie markers taken away from them and not allowed to you ever use them again.

They ruin and defame expensive designer clothes, stone and terracotta collectibles and all sorts of other high end merchandise. They tell you that it can be washed off when it's certainly cannot. It can only be washed off of glass objects. It is such a major disappointment to pick up a beautiful object and see that is has been totally ruined.< /Review>

<review>Clothing is somewhat organized by type of item but not by color or size. Bric a Brac is more of a treasure hunt. Prices are a bit high for newly arrived items but there is often a sale going on most days of the week. Most employees are friendly and helpful.</review>< Time>

45% off entire store, 75% off red tags. Good little spot. Some of the clothes are faded and look worn as well as the shoes but if u get the right color tag, can get sum really cheap things. In general comparing to brand new from the mall, you're getting a steal. Saw a old navy jacket, thick, still in really good shape, had red tag for 14.99, 75% off that? Steal! Random stuff like a thriftstore does, electronics, cds dvds, toys, kitchen ware etc. $3 for dvds....so does walmart brand new....but here is a better cause</review>

I donate here frequently the manager is great you can talk to him about an item if you don't think it's worth what they're asking and if he agrees he will lower the price price, he's done that quite often for me</text>

Way overpriced compared to other Salvation Armys. Men's ties start at $3.99. Used hardcover books are $4. That's their regular prices then they have an even more expensive boutique section.<//Review>

Somewhat tragic, broken,  overpriced merchandise, they do have good sales once in a while though and sometimes something really worthwhile.<//Text>

<review>This place is extremely overrated. If you want your money/food to be thrown down the drain, this is the place to go. Unlike other restaurants that are going beyond their way during covid times to provide the best quality of food, Vishnuji exactly does the opposite. Ordered a bunch of food along with palak panner. Palak panner was spinach mixed with water and garlic with  5 cubes of paneer. Worst palak panner in the Bay Area. In case you order Tava roti, be prepared to eat uncooked ones.

Management really sucks. They even acknowledged that they have have a problem with the chef. When asked, the owner said he has no time to check orders when packing them.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNh6-sEfk-pimmgqhZKE2xIRNoKv6gVb34Ec7_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0htAl48_QwC308XqhsYWq2dVKmZ9qjorL__Vs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I love the regular combo thali at this place. This may be a couple of $$ pricer that near by options, but the way they pack each item separately and quantity served is just fulfilling... And taste great, an option i consider for a quick take away.<//review>< Pictures>

We did a pickup order of Puranpoli, Buttermilk, and Rasamalai. The taste of Puranpoli, and Buttermilk were good. After reaching home when we tried to eat Rasamalai, we found out that the Rasamalai for rotten. Kindly check the quality of products before you serve it to the customers. Because these sorts of things can be given directly to the children.</text>

<review>This restaurant is a food paradise! Authentic tasty Maharashtrian cuisine in traditional dinnerware makes for an awesome experience. I loved every dish on the buffet, but the Shrikhand (Yogurt based dessert) was the best. Extremely impressed, so glad that finally I have my local cuisine available so close home in the Bay area. The staff is friendly and speak in Marathi which made me feel right at home. Totally recommend this place to everyone who wants to try authentic Indian Food but not the usual fare.</review></record>

This was built in the ashes of a very ex-famous Konkani-Goan restaurant which lost their awe with times. Now this is "the" place for unlimited thali and that is the only and unmissable USP of them.</review>

We ordered only Rumali Roti and they gave us Roti.
I’m not sure this is how they serve in the restaurant or maybe just because this we ordered pickup.
Even the Rotis are so bad and they took 60 mins< /text>

Taste, flavors, ambience and authenticity! This place has all this in abundance and is topped with great hospitality and service. From the plates and glasses to arrangement of food and condiments to photos of Indian history and heritage - it’s a treat for all our senses! A must visit!

Pro-tip: Skip the rush and reach there at 11:29! And comfortably have your first round of buffet as the fans start pouring in 😊< /text>

We went there as our friend suggested that it has very good service. He mentioned about his good dining experience at this restaurant. Sadly we went there on Thanksgiving snd they were closed for dine out, so we ended up taking to go.
We ordered malai kofta and fal makhani. It was tasty but portions were small.
I will definitely give this one more chance because of good things i have heard about it.<//review>

<Text>Waste of money, waste of time and horrible experience. Very poor management and they don't any idea how to treat customers. Very poor service and they behave as if some unwanted guest have come home. In spite of waiting nearly an hour we received a horrible food. I'm putting 1 star as I don't have an option to put anything less than that.<//Text><rate>1< /rate>< Name>

<text>Complete waste of money..poor service..worst dine-in experience. we received our order after 45 mins and that too in packaged plastic containers..half of our food have been replaced without our consent..then while serving he said that we are bringing whatever we can because you must be Hungary by now...like it was the last place in the world to get the food....we came out to eat for some good experience, not for fill our stomach with anything....let's come on food quality...we ordered veg Kolhapuri,naan,batata Vada, mushroom matar, dal makhni , chilli paneer and kothambir ...they replaced dal makhni with yellow dal fry without our consent...naan was hard to swallow and less in the quantity.. however, when we complaint about it then they have removed it from check..veg kohlapuri was like uncooked vegetables with chilli powder, no pao in Vada pao. I was really regretting to choose this restaurant when I was paying  for such worst service and worst food.</text>< pictures>

<Review>In a country where the local cuisine changes dramatically every 30 miles, the city of Nagpur, which is in the Vidarbha region of the western state of Maharashtra, needs special mention !

And who better to represent it than the best known chef from Nagpur – Mr. Vishnu Manohar lovingly and respectfully called “Vishnuji”.

And then we heard that Vishnuji is to open a Franchise of his famous global chain of restaurants “Vishnuji ki Rasoi” in Sunnyvale CA and we eagerly looked forward to having a meal there.

At least yesterday we had the privilege to visit the new restaurant. It presently has a soft opening and they are serving limited items and that too in a buffet style.

And we were so pleased to see that the great chef himself was there, overseeing the cooking and serving of customers. What a humble man and so sweet to talk too! Ever ready to do anything to please his customers and admirers !

He was ably supported by his local partner, Sameer Patil, who seemed eager to pick up the ropes and run the place, once Vishnuji returns home next week.

The food variety itself was limited, but a morsel of each item brought back memories of authentic home cooked Maharashtrian meals - ones that your Indian aunt would make for you with love and care.

I particularly swooned over the “Shev chi Sabji” very spicy, but mouthwateringly good !. The better half swore that “Masala Bhaath” was exactly how she recollected it to taste. And other acocmpanyments too were made very very well !

They expect to serve buffets for lunch with all items and a-la-carte from next Tuesday. Will look forward to coming here and tasting them.

Today’s meal had all vegetarian items (considering the soft opening and the auspicious religious festival of “Navratri” being celebrated back in India (Bay Area also celebrates it with equal enthusiasm at different temples around the greater Bay)!

But I would love to come back and try their Chicken Koliwada ( a favorite dish from the city of Mumbai)

Will be back real soon !</Review>< pics>

I definitely will recommend this place to my friends. It was our first time when we tried Indian cuisine. Originally we are from Europe. Authentic place with traditional food and ambience was topped with great service. Staff was so courteous, attentive and kind. They are explained everything! For people that haven’t tried Indian food before it was very helpful and interesting! It was great experience! I am so exited and happy with my experience. Thank you so much!< /Text>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Food was okay for most part. The vegetable rice and cauliflower was extremely oily and even a bit too spicy. It'll be good if they refill the items fast during the weekends. It also felt like too many tables for that space. The wait was long, so we opted for outdoor seating which was quick. It was our first time trying this food and it was okay overall.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The food was decent, nothing too good or too bad. Shrikhand was a little sour in taste. Thecha (chilli chutney) was a little salty. Dal and rice were good. DIY pan was good.

Management was very poor, most of the time, they were out of plates or bowls or some food items. I had to do more trips to the food counter than required to check if the item is available. Overall, decent to try for one time and taste Maharashtrian cuisine.</text>< Time>

< review>
We went here for lunch on a Saturday. We were told that the wait times were more than 40 minutes. While waiting, we roamed around and were called before the stipulated time.

This place though small is reminiscent of it's Pune branch. It has a rustic feel with all the brass ware and Maharashtrian utensils of the olden times. The chutney bowls are a highlight as well.

Now for the food, they have atleast 4 types of chutneys, chillies, and then the Mirchi thecha! They had mini samosas and khekda bhaji today and papads. There were 4 types of authentic Maharashtrian vegetables, two types of rice - masale bhat & plain, kadhi & two sweets.

Arguably, the mirchi in all these dishes was a bit lacking. But overall the food was awesome! Complementary paan was indeed good as well. All this for $12.99! I'm coming back for more!<//review>

Got to chance to be here after the few months of opening. Was very Happy with the service. Got a very good treatment. Special we had a server Saurabh. He was very friendly and also served us onion baji n Puri as well. The best was the complimentary Shreekahnd. That's was awesome.. pure with kesar n cardamom.. n creamy. Overall food taste is very authentic. with variety of chutney, pickle n all.. Was very happy. And finishing touch was the DIY paan.. super.<//Text>

<text>One of the very good options for the Marati lunch buffet.
Good blend of spices along with different curry options. But could be crowded on weekend lunches, so better to go before 1PM.

Service could be better, as that is one of the limitations of this place.</text><Gmap_id>0x808fb785588c0c17:0x58f4cb6973460ea2<//Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>4<//rate>< time>

Very good restaurant to go for lunch buffets. It's a unique experience. The place is pretty crowded and the wait time is long. But for the price you pay, it's really on point. For people who are debating to visit this restaurant, it's definitely worth a try, especially if you're into Marathi/Gujrathi cuisine</text>

Everything is good.. food, service, quality ..what is strange for me here is they deducted half price for 3 year old kid as well.. though we were seating on first table and they properly observed also that he ate just chips ... still it was the first restaurant where we paid for 3 year old.</Text>

<review>Variety of items but lacking in the taste to be authentic maharashtrian thali. It's a good place for one time. May not go as repeat customer. Moong dal halwa was amazing and the maharashtrian curry was authentic. Apart from these two items rest of the thali was ok in taste.Service was ok as well given that place is having crowd during weekends One person was alone managing outside tables. Buffet area passage was too crowded and utensils were not there. I will recommend as one time visit.</review><resp>None</resp></record>

This is one of the best maharashtrian restaurent. This is vidarbha style food and they have authentic marathi food like thecha, shev bhaji, vada bhat and many more. They are consistent in their food taste. Loved it. Would highly recommend this place if you want to try authentic marathi food.<//Review>

Tried their Sunday night buffet and I was not disappointed. Food was lovely with authentic Maharashtrian taste where you could actually enjoy the meal and reminisce your time back home having such a delightful delicacies. The owner is a very sweet person and offered amazing hospitality throughout our meal.
Will definitely visit again.<//text>

Ordered through mealhi5 webpage listed by restaurant. Owner said they do not receive order through that website. Then I do not know why they listed this site for online orders. Came empty handed. At restaurant, there was total confusion. No arrangements for social distancing was done and also not followed at restaurant.< /review>

Ordered veg kolhapuri with rumali roti. Veg kolhapuri tasted like uncooked veggies dipped in red chili purée. It was an absolute disaster. I usually never leave any feedback on any food that I’ve ordered. But, after tasting their food, I just had to. Please change your recipe!<//review>

Excellent food! Very few places you can actually get nice nutritious food. On a weekend, the price of dinner buffet was 11.99 + tax. Which is very decent as the food looked and tasted fresh. Was able to find a table without any wait.<//text>

Authentic Maharashtrian food, finally in the bay area. Most common choice is to take the thali and try little of several dishes. Do ask someone about the condiments to add to different dishes. They are  placed nearby. The chutneys are excellent. They have seats outside with heat lamps.

They serve poori, if you are early, you may have to wait for it. There are a few items also on the menu.

I hope this restaurant thrives. We do need variety of cuisines. I wonder if they should adopt the Rajwadi style to serve at the table, for refills. Initially just give minimum of each dish to taste.</text>

<Text>Food was good taste for the most part. There was no cream in curries which was excellent thing. I liked different flavours and chutneys. I am not Maharashtrian but taste seem authentic. One Curry was very oily which I did not like. It was to my surprise when they charged my 3 year old without asking for eating 6 chips when he was having total empty plate the whole time. It is not too much but I would consider this point as bad service. Arrangement and ambience was nice too.<//Text><GmapID>0x808fb785588c0c17:0x58f4cb6973460ea2<//GmapID><user>112964996703300384224<//user></record></dataset><record>
<review>Love this place. The owners and staff are courteous. If you tell them you have some dietary restrictions, they will prepare it accordingly and it will turn out to be quite good. Recently, they added Palak Paneer, and Paneer Lababdar. All paneer items are tasty. Vaangi (eggplant) masala is too good. Kothimbir vadi is delicious. Only thing, I've to tell them is to make it less spicy for their default is a bit spicy for us. Bombay Vada Pav is great along with their chutneys. They started Tandoor items and we have tried out their butter naan, and tandoori roti.<//review>< user_id>

I have been to this place a few times now. During pre covid time I used to enjoy their buffet style Maharashtrian food. I love their kurkuri bhindi and the green chutney is absolute bomb.
Bonus points to them for the Maharana Pratap portrait.< /review>

<text>Amazing place. As it is a new place so we have to give them some time to settle. I read the reviews, some review say that worst management and all. This is completely unfair. There is no mismanagement and food is super yummy. I would personally request all to visit rasoi and give there valuable time for feedback in person to the owners over there who are always present. The food, ambience, decor and menu are the best.<//text>< Pics>

Simple food and nothing extraordinary. Wish they had more vegetable curries in the buffet. Couple of the curries were just gravy based, watery and spicy with no vegetables.
Would definitely give it a skip the next time.<//Review>

However little pricier for the kind of ambiance  they provide. They run out of chapati very often though that you have to stand in line while eating.. :)<//Text>

<text>The food is great. But this rating is specifically for the service that is being provided.
On a weekend , be prepared to wait for 10-15 min to get anything or even a response from the server. The management should either reduce the number of tables being served or increase the number of waiters. It's a CHAOS ON WEEKENDS.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb785588c0c17:0x58f4cb6973460ea2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Had high expectations from this place, wasn't really satisfied. Ordered zunka-bhakari combo, sabudana khichadi and shrikhand-puri to go from this place. 5/5 for the value for money.  The zunka-bhakari was very nice, authentic taste and so was the thecha served with it. However, the puri and sabudana khichadi were almost too oily to eat. Gave me a bad stomach next day.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Saboodana vada was too thick and bland inside.  Phulkas were not actual phulkas but are like sukha chapatis. We ordered too many thinking they are phulkas.  So, we had plenty of left over chapatis. Pathal baaji is good. Kothambar vadi was very good. Still, a little too pricey for the kind of food served.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Traditional Maharashtra vegetarian food. It felt very good to eat a Indian buffet with out cream in any vegetables and there was no paneer dish.  If it was for just food, I would have given 5 stars. The seating is very cramped. There is less than a feet gap between tables.</review>< response>

Go to place for  Authentic maharastrian vegetarian food .

* Taste & quality is good
* Bad odor from the copper jugs and tumblers in which they are serving water It would be great if they could  clean them properly.

* Customer service and the hospitality could have been better<//text>

The place has too many tables for the space available. The menu is very small for a weekend buffet and for the price. The good items like PuranPoli and Shrikhand (both were really good) are extra! The vegetable rice was too oily and spicy and they didn't have all the buffet items ready even at 12:30pm on a Saturday. In true Indian fashion, the wait staff was indifferent.</text>

<Text>Decent food - very crowded at 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon! Waited for 30 minutes and then nearly 10 minutes in the buffet line. The food made it worth it - especially the chutneys and the pudis (powders). The pulao and the curries were awesome. The kheer and jamoon provided a delicious finish. Not much of wait staff service but they were polite and cheerful. They have self-serve paan outside but it was mostly over by 3.15 pm when we left (and the restaurant was closed)</Text>< Resp>

The food was ok. It was nice home cooked food style. You should not expect the commonly found spicy and oily food at Indian restaurants. Overall, you want a buffet but you don't to burden your stomach with digestion.....😀<//text>

<Text>Enjoyed the Maharashtrian food. The food is simply delicious & roti is served hot from the tava directly to the plate. The place is bang for buck. Will definitely be visiting again when in nearby area. They need to improve their bathroom & handwash area.<//Text>< Rate>

Came on a Saturday for lunch. It was PACKED. I'm not sure they were ready for such a crowd. The place is small, and there's not much room to move around.

Food. There are a lot of accompaniments which was different from the typical Indian buffet. There's a green herb paste which is incredible and fresh. The preserved lemon paste was amazing too.

Issues: there were maybe 8 dishes; 2 of them rice, 1 of them sweet. Nothing was labeled, not that it would have mattered for me, but there's always Google. Most things were empty, because again, it was PACKED. So after you navigate back to your seat after a few minutes, your food is cold and of course THAT'S when they bring out the fresh stuff. People were going back for 2nds with the same plates they already used GROSS. They ran out of the small silver dishes/bowls and gave small disposable plastic ones to use. VERY wasteful...

Honestly- a better model would be to bring everyone, everything. You could ask if they want white rice or yellow, offer seconds on anything they liked, and hold the sweet until the end. I realize this requires more staff, but honestly it would be so much smoother considering space and how few items there are.

All that said, it was tasty, I didn't miss meat, and I was grossly full until the following day. Everything was fairly salty as well. Not sure I'd be back, but always happy to try something new.< /review>

<Text>The sitting area is small and its difficult to find a table during weekends. Place is chaotic partly due to poor management and limited seats. Its not possible to enjoy ur meal here. There is no dining experience, you just get to eat ur food and leave. However the food was good (but greasy).<//Text>< Pictures>

Giving 5 stars for my admiration to Chef Vishnu Manohar, whom I personally met when I visited this restaurant. He has an amazing grasp over central indian (varhadi) cuisine. Must visit ! Bay area is lucky enough to have his first international franchise.< /review>

<review>Good ambiance but food is average. We went for friday buffet. Limited appetizers, and curries were not that tasty. Roti was too thick and pooris were not hot.  New pooris were also not done right. Desserts were better, gulab jamun and shrikhand. Liked the way food was setup and served.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fb785588c0c17:0x58f4cb6973460ea2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Being from Pune I had high hopes from this and boy they delivered right on it. It's a authentic maharashtrian restaurant, serves loads on maharashtrian dishes ranging from chutneys, Chaat, mains and dessert. Would definitely request you to check this place out if you are not aware of what maharashtrian food tastes like<//Text>

<Review>I would give zero if I could. Management was the worst part. Can you believe there was no food at all and had to wait 10 mins just to get rice. Everything was so spicy that I could not have more than 2 spoons. My brother literally had two spoons of soup and that’s all. Wow would never go there again. Save your money.<//Review>< pictures>

The restaurant owned by Vishnuji Manohar is famous for authentic maharashtrian food. But this time, they served a punjabi food, with no taste meeting the class at all.

Authentic Maharashtrian food but one star for rude owner/manager. Initially he stated 30 min wait but there were no people waiting and we got table in 5 min for 6 people. Secondly, I was with my baby and he asked me to stand outside. I said it cold outside. He replied then sit in car don't stant here.<//review>

<text>I have been to this place recently and here's my experience.

I went for lunch and found there were people already waiting in queue. Since we accepted to sit outside, we were able to get the table immediately. The restaurant only serves Maharashtrian Vegetarian Buffet. It was a decent amount of space, but considering it is self-service buffet, it can feel chaotic in that limited space.

Coming to the food, this was the first time I was trying Maharashtrian cuisine, so I cannot claim for authenticity, but the menu (containing Masala Bhat, Patal Bhaji, Sev Bhaji, Khadi, etc) stood out from a typical North Indian or South Indian fare. The flavors were also delicious with each dish having a distinct base. It was also a (pleasingly) good amount of spice that you would expect out of an Indian cuisine.

Service - 3 🌟
Ambience - 3 🌟
Food - 5 🌟<//text>< Response>

<review>We went here for a Sunday lunch buffet.The food was well made, authentic and delicious Maharashtrian cuisine. The batatavada, chutneys, thecha and masalebhath were lip-smacking, a bit on the spicy side. Chopped off a star because getting to the food buffet was difficult in the limited space. It would make the meal more pleasant if they just brought the food to the table and served it thali style.< /review><GmapID>0x808fb785588c0c17:0x58f4cb6973460ea2<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Authentic Maharashtrian food. Went for buffet. Hand grinded chatneys/thecha. Patalbhaji was good too. And the gulabjamuns were great.
Their to-go thali price is quite good. 2 sabjis, 10 rotis for $10.
The only thing is, this place is crowded on weekends. Wait time is around 20-30 minutes for me. It may differ on any particular day.<//text>

<text>Good quality food. Had buffet. Shrikhand was good. Reasonably priced. Self serve paan (yes paan) at the end is a great idea.

We went close to 7pm on a weekend. Service was good too.

Suggestion: add vada pav to the mix.< /text>< user_name>

< review>
This was second visit. First went well so I came back alone. But it was a very uncomfortable and unpleasant meal.
1) They didn’t have table for one so asked me if I could share a table. I agreed but another family of 3, woman was insecure sitting next to me so left. Not my problem.

2) Food was so HOT. I mean with hot peppers. I tasted a chutney after a couple of other bites and my mouth was burning for rest of the evening. I couldn’t taste anything afterwards. I ended up eating lots of raita to subside the burning mouth.

3) since the other family didn’t join the table and they didn’t ask anyone else to share, I was alone at table of 5. Place is very cramped BTW. Manager kept coming to check if I’ve finished the meal. Asked me twice. Once after I was done and about to get up, he asked might I consider moving.

This is not a charity, I paid full asking price. So NO, I wouldn’t move if I was in the middle of my meal. I felt rushed and very uncomfortable.

Nonetheless, this was the last visit. Won’t come back.</review>

<Text>Very simple basic food and doesn't taste that great. Ok for weekday lunch but not when you want good food.

Menu was pretty mediocre - aloo sabzi, baingan sabzi, three types of Dal. taste also mediocre.
Taste will be better in average Indian home.

They should add more dry vegetable options.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

A very blessed meal - the chutneys were quintessentially maharashtrian, fulki really soft and dal and curries, very reminiscent of the thalis I had in Bombay. Hoping to catch aamras-puri in the season time! Loved everything about the place< /text>

Apart from the novelty of perhaps getting an authentic Maharashtrian meal, this place is not worth it..

Average food, cramped seating, cramped buffet service, mediocre service, the list goes on..

Even the rotis were mediocre, which is a big deal when you are serving an authentic thali..

I would like to believe it was an off day, and might give it a second chance, but I won't be looking forward to it..</text>

I catered for Satyanarayana Swamy Pooja. Had the pleasure to actually speak with chef Vishnuji and he recommended the menu for Pooja lunch.
Shrikhand, Puri, Patera bhaji,Batata bhaji, sol kadhi and Jeera rice were amazing. Typical maharashtrian pooja lunch.
I also added chole, kanda bhaji, chai.
Our guests seemed to have liked it very much. They praised the dishes.</Review>

Horrible restaurant in terms of space. Just to get the food you have to stand for such a long time. Space is totally cramped up. They serve paneer ki bhaji which is no where close to maharashtrian food.</review>

Vishnuji ki rasoi is a good vegetarian Indian place. The  waiters are friendly and prompt. Meghana made the best masala doodh.
I enjoyed Paan outside.
It got a bit crowded so paan counter could be cleaned up more. Other then that the place is good .<//Text>

The food was very close to authentic food in Vidarbha region for a few days when they opened up but it has gone from bad to worse in the last year.
Gave it couple tries after I started disliking the food to taste something different on the menu, tried bhindi once and Srikhand the second time, they were one of the worst I have ever had.< /text>

Good maharashtrian food, reasonable price
They should use big containers to store food for buffet, it gets over pretty quickly & then we have to wait for them to refill
They should buy more dishes & bowls< /review>

This lot has seen various restaurants and I think VKR is the best till date. Food was super good, might be a little spicy for some people. Sambar wadi, Sabudana Wada (Moti Tikki), Patawadi, shev bhaji was really good.
They have a good collection of old Indian kitchen utensils on showcase.</text>

No planning . We wanted to order but asked to go for buffet.
First hurdle - not enough Thalis, when Thali no bowl or spoon …
Then food items were missing in serving area - items were empty and there was nobody to look after .
It was not that much busy either .. but planning and execution was worst
Finally, some how got 2 bowls and sabji , then bread server told me that only roti is option as other options Naan or poori etc will take lot of time

when asked for napkin, he tool 10 min to get paper napkin and plastic glass for water .

Never going again !</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>The food was pretty decent. Apart from that there is absolutely nothing good about this place. It took them 20 minutes to get our appetizer. I ordered the kadai paneer for my entree but they got me mutter paneer after 30 minutes of waiting. my roti, which came at least 10 minutes before they brought me my wrong entree, was already cold. I sent the mutter paneer back as it was not what I wanted. I waited another 20 minutes for my kadai paneer before giving up and eating my roti with my friend's leftover sabji. I never got what i ordered. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE! I was very close to telling the people who were yet to order to go elsewhere!! It was a Wednesday evening and they were barely busy! Who takes 20+ minutes to make masala papad!?!? I'm never going back !<//review>< pics>

<review>This restaurant serves the best Maharashtrian style food in the Bay Area. We tried the dinner buffet which had 3 curries, masala buttermilk, shrikhand, onion bhaji, soup, 2 types of rice and dal. There were about 7 types of condiments as well. Each curry was very flavorful. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to people who are looking to enjoy a delicious Indian/Maharahstrian style food.< /review><rating>5</rating>< Time>

<text>Meh! Go if you are on a diet, there is nothing to eat in their buffet anyways. Go if you want to spend money but not get any variety in the buffet.  Food options were basically non-existent. Oh and don't forget that you have to buy the tea for $2, again in a BUFFET !</text>< Response>

(Translated by Google) On scale of 1-5: Kothimbir vadi: 4 Patodi bhaji: 3 Baingan rassa: 2 Puranpoli: 3. What to improve: 1) Less oil in baingan bhaji 2) Puranpoli needs a lot of improvement (sweetness, smell, textutre)

(Translated by Google) Great Maharashtrian meal! Pure vegetarian! The chili crust was very nice, not too sharp. The Shrikhand Puri combination was great. The potato wad was too heavy! In the end Vida's page was so much fun !!

(Original)
उत्कृष्ट महाराष्ट्रीयन जेवण! शुद्ध शाकाहारी! मिरची चा ठेचा खूप छान होता, इतका पण तिखट नव्हता. श्रीखंड पुरी combination खूप छान होता. बटाटे वडा तर फारच भारी होता! शेवटी विडाच्या पानाने तर फार मज्जा आली!!<//Review>
