< Review>
Besides the fact that Enterprise is extremely overpriced, the staff is super nice, willing to do anything to make you satisfied. I've actually never seen such a professional and helpful attitude before.
In my experience, I did an online reservation. When I picked the car up, the gas tank was nearly empty, and the windscreen washer fluid wasn't replenished. Also at the dealership, I found out that the already high price didn't even include the additional insurance coverage. After adding that, it made the cost 2 times higher than the price of their competition (Avis, hertz,...).
The car was quite new (just 7 000 miles) and more or less clean.
Afterwards, I returned the car with nearly a full tank of gas (instead of the original empty tank) as I had to cancel a part of my trip and didn't use all the gas as I planed.
They asked if I was satisfied, they took my criticism and offered to give me a discount and refund me for the extra fuel. I came there angry and was leaving in a positive mood. It was a very pro-customer oriented attitude. I guess the extra high cost is paid for the customer oriented approach. If it's worth the high price, that's what everyone has to figure out for themselves.< /Review>

<Review>Super friendly staff, no issues with our car and it was very clean. They let us do an after-hours return which was really helpful! But, we had to wait over an hour from the time we arrived to pick up our car (and we were early for our reservation time) which delayed our plans. Maybe it was unusually busy, but I wouldn't book from here if your rental is time-sensitive.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1617495545057, 'text': "We're listening and would like to know more, Roya.

I was unable to get my insurance-covered rental car from this location due to big miscommunications and incompetent service. The person I spoke with (Kenny) was not helpful at all when there were no more vehicles left that were within my coverage, and even after I got my insurance to change my coverage limit, Kenny said this was not reflected in their system. After more back and forth between insurance and Enterprise, it turns out they had rented every single one of their cars (which was clearly not communicated to me until later) and I was left without transportation that day. After having my car broken into, this was the last thing that I wanted to deal with. Luckily, the Broadway location was highly competent and did a perfect job helping me the next day.< /Review>

<text>I and my husband rent a car during valentine's day. I have used Enterprise car rental for several years and found this place is close to us with good reviews and different car rental options. People are nice here, but unfortunately, they slightly overcharged.

- there only has two doors coupe luxury car. it was too small for us. we took it anyway but it's very small.

- and one hour return late, they charge us an extra day rental which is 60.89$+3.540$.

- we return the car with the same gas level, maybe 0.01% different, and they 16.20$ fuel service option.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1613672656556, 'text': 'Ms. Wang, we would like to look into this further.

< review>
I will start off by saying that all of the gentlemen that work at this location are extremely friendly and helpful, so no complaints there. My complaint has to do with the car that I rented which I ended up having to exchange. I rented an SUV and was originally given a black Nissan Rouge. Had I smelled how strong the vehicle had smelled of weed and cigarettes, I would have requested a vehicle change immediately. However, I had a mask on and couldn't smell anything.

We had intended on leaving for our vacation later that night but after smelling how terrible the car smelled we couldn't leave because the smell was absolutely unbearable. I have 2 kids and one being an infant. I couldn't subject my children to the terrible smell it was almost sickening. Not to mention there was some sort of device on the passenger side of the front window. It's not legal in California to have anything on your windshield that may obstruct your view. I was worried I would be pulled over because of it. Could you imagine a African American being pulled over with a car reeking of weed with 2 kids in the car? Ya...not cool.

Long story short, we couldn't leave the day we had intended on leaving because of the above. I called  early the next day and requested a vehicle change. I was offered 10% which was nice but considering the situation I should have had the first day free.<//review>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>I reserved a mid to large SUV. I picked up just before closing. Check out was quick and easy. Unfortunately there were two very unexpected issues with the vehicle: 1. It thoroughly reeked of cigarette smoke. Thoroughly. 2. The gas tank was only 1/4 full. This second issue wouldn’t be a big deal if they had pointed it out and told me how to address it, i.e. return it with a quarter tank. I tried to exchange it with two other local branches, but neither had a vehicle that would suit my needs (space for camping equipment)

The vehicle itself drove beautifully. It was a Nissan rogue. It fit all of our camping equipment for a family of 3. I took it to coastal Oregon and back, including on some gnarly dirt roads.

Heavy, daily use of Fabreeze gave us just enough relief to get through the vacation with this vehicle.

I returned the vehicle with more gas than I had started out with. I mentioned this fact in the extreme cigarette smell to the returning agent. After checking the vehicle he agreed that they probably would not be able to rent the vehicle out again. He did give me a break on the price by way of apology.</Text><user_id>103556090494645114274</user_id>< Resp>

<text>I never post reviews but these folks are so great I had to! I really love the small location near Ashby Bart, but it's closed due to Covid. Over the past year I have had experiences with this branch on San Pablo ave. and the one up in Hilltop Mall (Richmond CA). All 3 of these spots I'd give 5 stars. Enterprise rocks - they treat you with respect, professionalism, and courtesy, they don't try to stick you with hidden fees or rip you off, and they're flexible if you need to return it later or earlier than you thought. Their base cost *is* a little higher than Budget or Hertz but when you take into account that those places nickel and dime you on little extra fees and "hustle" you in the process and just generally treat you like dirt, I'd take Enterprise over those fools any day, and I end up paying less too. I have never had a bad experience with any of the Enterprise employees, they make it EASY and even have a sense of humor - imagine that! Thanks :)<//text>< Pics>

The car was new.  Ran great.  Pick up was easy.  Due to the covid the drop off location was understaffed and I was not able to get a ride home. Normally Enterprise has this option.  I do not blame them for the virus problems though.< /review>

<text>I picked Enterprise because they gave me the best rate for a week than anybody else. I needed a car for at least a week because mine was being worked on after an accident. When I called and made a reservation on the phone it was really easy and the person I spoke with was friendly and made the whole process painless. I double checked before hanging up that paying with a debit card would be ok and asked if I needed to bring anything with me and she told me a debit card would be ok and no I didnt need to bring anything, just pick the car up. So I arrive to pick up the car and the gentleman who was helping me asked if I had proof of insurance with me, I told him no, I was told I didnt need to bring anything but I can pull it up on my phone he said ok and as Im doing this he decides to look at my card and payment info and then asks me if I had a credit card not debit card, I explained that i didnt have a credit card that a debit was all I had and that ,again, I was told it was ok. He said ok and looked at my information further and said Im sorry it needs to be a chip card, I said I dont have a chip and, again, was told it was ok to which he said 'I'm sorry, I cant rent to you without a chip card' and cancelled my reservation. That was that, I wasn't offered any further help or suggestion. The gentleman didnt offer to speak with somebody else to see if something could be done, nothing. I then had to spend extra money to get a Lyft back home, and am back at square one with no car. I arrived at Enterprise feeling relief and hopefull, but because of some wrong information, I guess, I left feeling lost and stranded. Rate wise you guys are great and the gentleman who work at the location I was at are nice and professional, but you shouldn't cancel a reservation and leave someone stranded with no further help because they were told wrong information< /text>< pics>

I have used Enterprise for years and have always had a good experience.  In this instance I received an Enterprise car in connection with a car insurance claim.  The car was delivered on time, and was picked up at the time I retrieved my vehicle from the repair company.  The whole experience was seamless.< /text>

Rented a suv rav 4 and they checked me in pretty quick and got me on the road fast. Only thing is that they weren’t able to show the schematics of the car. As a new driver it helps to get used to the controls.< /text>

<review>North Berkeley branch was great. Customer service was amazing. Professional. Accommodating. 👍
My reservation was made day of too.
Wish I had gone to them first tbh. Earlier that morning I went to pickup at the branch I originally made reservations with and was told they were sold out. "Sorry bud". Despite reservations having been made well in advance. No notifications whatsoever. Had to rush over to berkeley and hope they could help me and they did, and they were 💯.<//review>< Date>

<name>MMTonga< /name><review>This review is for a wonderful employee named Mel.

Started off a weekend to Reno with a truck from an Enterprise at another location. Started our trip from Hayward then about around Emeryville/Berkeley the tire pressure monitors on the truck came on and they were seriously under inflated. Without panicking I conveniently pull of at the nearest gas station in Berkeley, pumped air to all the tires to the recommended pressure. Still, no go with the monitors, still showing under inflated tires. Decided I wasn’t gonna go to Reno with me just staring at it the whole way. Google’d the nearest Enterprise and waited about 10 mins for it to open.

Mel, the young woman that greeted us was all smiles from start. Told her the situation, and in about 10 mins time we were out of there and back on the road, seriously the most stress-free service ever experienced. Wow! Not only that she swapped out this nasty F-150 the other location did a piss-poor cleaning job on, because of the weed I found in the center console they forgot to clean, but it was Dodge Ram Classic 5.7 Hemi. Ah! Mopar Muscle, kind of. 🤣

Thank you Mel for your great and above and beyond customer service, you made our trip feel safe. Jenney and Mo.✌🏽</review>< Pictures>

I needed a truck or van with an hour's notice and Mel at the Enterprise in Berkeley made it work for me.  She was courteous on the phone and then quickly got me a truck that would work for the moving job I had.
She then set me up for the return the next day that made it easy and convenient for me.
She did a great job and should be commended by Enterprise for her great customer service efficient work.  I highly recommend Enterprise based on this rental, and previous rentals I've made through them.< /review>

Staff was great, car could have been better.
Car was rented on my behalf by a dealership doing warranty work on my own car. Enterprise pick-up / drop-off shuttle driver was nice, as were staff at "headquarters" in Berkeley.
The car, a 2018 Camry with about 27K miles, could have been cleaner inside and the instrument panel displayed a warning advising of a collision avoidance system malfunction the entire time we had the car.< /Review>

I wanted to give a rave review in regards to Mel and Ms. Vicky (warm, careful driver who picked me up was sweet, & signals - yay!) at the Berkeley location on San Pablo Avenue. I'm not a frequent customer but I recall the first time the efficiency, warmth and care so I returned. Unfortunately, I don't recall the fellow who helped me then but today, after I dropped off the rental, Mel took care of everything and was so proficient helping me from the beginning when I first got the rental until the end when I brought it back. Felt like she really cared and I was taken care of. Kudos on such a wonderful assistant manager to be hired on this team!

Person, who sounded male, on Saturday 16th when I called was very nice over the phone too! Picked up quickly. Everyone I've encountered has smiled, acknowledged me even though Mel was helping me. Thumbs up! 👍<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I'm a big fan of the Enterprise on S. Pablo in Berkeley (the one near Gilman). I have rented from there 2-3 times over the last several years and have always had a positive experience. The most recent was to rent a car to take down to Disneyland for several days. The pick-up was so quick - I think we were in and out of there in under five minutes. Mel, the agent on duty, was extremely helpful and friendly. The car was great and the interaction was seamless. The only thing that I wish had been different was that I didn't know that there would be an extra deposit on my card and I would have chosen a different card if I had known. The dropoff was even better. We hit traffic in the grapevine on our way back and ended up returning home after the location had closed. I called on my way home and Mel was the one who answered the phone. Her words, "Take your time and drive safely. Just drop the car off before we open in the morning and there will be no extra charges." Such great customer service! I will continue to use this location for any future car rental needs!</Review>< Response>

I have used my neighborhood Enterprise for years when driving to Oregon and LA. This time we had a big trip to Utah in winter. I was concerned about snow and safety. I wanted a car with snow tires and 4 wheel drive. My local Enterprise is a small operation, and I didn't want to drive to the airport for more selection. I reserved well in advance and as always the team there was so polite and professional. I shared my concerns and they told me they would make sure I got an appropriate car for my needs.  Initially I talked to Aleah, who urged me to check in a few days before the trip to confirm my specific needs.. So I spoke with Alberto who made further notes in my order and reassured me they would take care of me. Finally on the day I would pick up my car, I spoke to Luis, in charge of vehicle acquisitions, and he assured me  he would have the perfect car for me.  When I arrived at my neighborhood Enterprise, I had a brand new SUV with snow tires and 4 wheel drive--still with NY license plates! Just what I wanted at a great price, delivered by a courteous and professional staff.  It made our trip. Thanks!< /Text>

I work with the Albany Unified School District and we have a corporate account with Enterprise. We rent a vehicle every week. Service has been great. They always handles our pick up very quickly. I really appreciate their courtesy and professionalism of Bill Lewis. Greg Atkinson has taken over for Bill Lewis now. Greg has been very diligent also.<//Text>

<text>I signed up for Enterprise Plus, got a 5% discount, and they then had my address, etc.  That may have speeded up the car checkout.  Had to wait about half an hour at home for pickup to go get the vehicle - no problem.  Electronic paperwork was quick and easy.  No hassle at all over using the insurance provided on my credit card.  Got a thorough introduction to the features and controls of the vehicle (Chevy Suburban).  Car was clean, handled well, everything worked.  After-hours return was quick and easy:  drop the keys in the slot.  Then the next morning I got an email confirming the charges.  Everyone was not only professional and knowledgeable, but genuinely friendly, and not smarmy.  It was the best experience I ever had renting a car.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>Excellent customer service at their West Berkeley office. The agent was very helpful as we checked out our car. They seem to specialize in minivans and pickup trucks at that location.</Review>< Rating>

<Name>Joe</Name><Time>1523453246507< /Time><Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Other than, "The staff are friendly and really WANT to help," there's not much positive for me to say about this place. Last year I rented a minivan for a school trip and one of the seats was broken. This year I tried to do the same, but when I got there the minivan I'd reserved a month in advance had broken down and wasn't available. They gave me a Ford Explorer instead, and offered me a 15% discount for my troubles. Very nice... Except...
The Explorer REEKED. The previous renters had obviously smoked a bunch of weed in the car, and instead of properly cleaning it the maintenance crew had used a massive amount of bubble-gum scented air freshener. My kids had to have the windows rolled down at 4:00 am driving down highway 5 because the car stank so much.
I turned the car in, and they tried to charge me for 5 days instead of 4. When I complained about the smell as I was correcting that, they said they'd add another 15% discount, but the total bill had only one of the two discounts applied.

So, wrong car, stinky car, near-empty tank, trying to charge me for an extra day, and failure to properly apply discounts. I really can't say that they did even a decent job on this one.

EDIT: In all fairness, they WERE desperately trying to find me a new minivan when the one I'd ordered wasn't ready. But as the estimated time went from 2 to 2:30 to 3:00 plus a ride into Oakland to go get it, I figured airing out the SUV was the better option. Oh, how wrong I was!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I chose to rent a car at this location after dealing with the inordinately long wait times at the Hertz up the road. While the car functioned well and the check-in was smooth, the check-out process was a headache.

We made a reservation online prior to the rental. When I arrived to pick up the car, the dates of the reservation were incorrect; the price given was $300 higher than what was quoted in the reservation (it took multiple exchanges for them to match the price on our online reservation); our information was lost between the desk and the lot, and so the type of car and price were incorrect again; and, the second driver's name was incorrectly listed on the receipt (though when we pointed this out, we were immediately issued a second receipt with the correct name).

Throughout, the staff were friendly and polite, though the number of errors makes me uneasy about using this rental service again.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1546643206808, 'text': 'Amy, we would like to look into this further.

The rep that I worked with was very attentive to detail. However, I did not appreciate having to drive to another location to pick up my vehicle.  I did appreciate accommodating my needs and even giving an extra 10% discount, but my schedule was definitely thrown off.

In the future, I  feel the vehicle and needs of the renter should be confirmed for a smoother renting experience.</review>

I have rented with this location several times and the staff are always friendly and efficient. However, twice now I have been given very dirty cars. There were crumbs and debris on the dashboard and cup holders and big gross stains on the seats. It was clear each time that the car had not been cleaned since it was last used. It's a convenient location for me, but I'm not sure I will be back after the crime scene that was the back seat of the last car I rented.< /Review>

<text>the agency is right at a corner with the parking lot before the agency so easy to miss and have to go around the block if coming from the north on San Pablo.   Great pick up in  Albany up and drop off at Berkeley Bart.  Car was an Elantra with 29K.  Not pristine...stains on the seats but mechanically worked well and drove well..we had it for a month.  Used a Costco discount.  The guy we checked out with was great.  I watched him deal with a couple of other customers and over heard two phone call inquiries and he handled them all very professionally as he did us.  He tried to find discounts for the callers and switched out cars for one customer.  He keep everyone posted as to times and progress and seemed unflappable.  Hope he stays with them.  He was one of the better Enterprise reps I've had.  I think his name was Steve and that the went to Sacramento State...so if enterprise reads this give him a pat on the back.  I rent from enterprise due to the customer service.  They were higher on this rental than hertz but their customer service makes it a no brainer.< /text>< Rate>

< Review>
Worst experience ever!!! At first I thought this was going to be a wonderful experience because my salesperson Ashley was a kind honest person. Also the other employees in the office were kind and warm. But I Would give 0 star if I could now that I know how this business is really ran. Hold on tightly to your contract!  Krystal will pretend to be nice and helpful at first only to overcharge you and you have to correct her with proof of what you actually paid for! I took out a total of 2 rentals back to back due to an insurance claim. Krystal lied and told me my insurance company said I could no longer use their discount, meaning I would have to pay market rate, and that ended up being a lie because my insurance company said anytime it is through the insurance company,  it is completely up to Enterprise if they want to keep allowing you to use an insurance company discount rate. Also, Krystal not only overcharged me for my rental claiming to "lose" my contract(conveniently when I told her I misplaced my copy in the last rental),  she was also rude to me and even called me to threaten me about a rental I had.  Keep in mind she knew I had a longer term rental through an insurance company, and when I came in she did not even say hello to me or offer to extend my rental.  It was sad that she at first charged me 4.50 for gas reimbursement until I proved otherwise using my contract from a current rental.  Krystal charged me an extensive amount of money for insurance she claims I took out on the rental yet she was unwilling to explain the "extra" charges written on the receipt.  Well, we will see what will happen because I have now found my misplaced contract and I didn't even take out the insurance that she charged me for! Also the 2.50 she insisted was the price of my gas was only $2.25.  I will see what this crook has to say once she sees it in writing. For the record I will never rent from or advise anyone to rent from these people again. If you have to rent from them, hold tightly to your contract, and plead for explanations about final charges on your receipt. DO NOT TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT-THEY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU ON THE SLIGHTEST THING IF YOU ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. I will not be surprised if someone pulls together a class action lawsuit on these people. It's only a matter of time. I can promise that If my car ever has to be in the shop again I will go with another company or just get on bus and Bart until the car gets out. Done!</Review>

Although booked an intermediate, all that were there were pickup trucks.  Manager agreed to rent, with a credit towards gas usage.  Very reasonable compromise.  Very helpful staff, positive and pleasant.  Car could be cleaner though-inside of windows a bit dirty.< /text>

I have NEVER experienced such a high quality of customer service as I did at the Enterprise store in Berkeley, CA as well as another Enterprise store I stopped at to ask for directions when I lost my way on the freeway!  If we all treated each other the way I was treated by each and every Enterprise agent I had the pleasure to receive service from, this world would be a kinder, safer, gentler and more peaceful place, and things would still get done!  BRAVO, Enterprise!< /Review>

<review>Fast friendly service. I like their new pre-paid gas option. You pay for what you use, not the entire tank. The price is very competitive make it a no brainier to opt in for this option. Enterprise has always provided me with good service.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Pics>None< /Pics><rating>5</rating><review>This Enterprise office is fantastic! I had been renting from Hertz just down the road, and the customer service is like night vs. day. Hertz on San Pablo is the worst rental experience I have ever had (repeatedly). But my company made me use them. I am now using Enterprise and loving it. They have let me choose my car the last two times. Their service has been prompt, professional, and friendly. And the bills are always accurate. If you live in Albany or Berkeley, do yourself a favor and switch from Hertz to Enterprise.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Definitely my go to place for Rent-A-Car's whenever I leave my car at Griffin Motorwerke's to get repaired.
I've rented from them a few times my most recent event where I needed a car they didn't have a full-size available they informed me that I could come back an check after lunch hour when the fleet would possibly be updated with more cars as an option...
Most rental places don't inform you of that kind a choice they just tell you to take it or leave it this is all we have Available or suggest to check the airport...</Text>

Staff is friendly but cars not always ready for rental. I recently reserved an economy car but, when I arrived to pick it up I was told it had been taken out of service. My service rep offered me a standard car at the same price - fine. However the car offered was dirty outside and inside (someone had kept a dog inside the car for an extended period dog smell, dog hair, dog food, who knows what else) and of course the gas tank was half empty. This really was the only choice available to me I accepted reluctantly due to time constraints. It is a shame as this location is convenient for me and the staff really are friendly although perhaps not the most effective. RA #: 8S7BB9</Text>

I suggest that for people wanting to drop off car at the that airport, Enterprise provide written instructions that allow the driver to negotiate the maze of turns and side roads that can be confusing to someone even when using Google maps on a cell phone, especially at night.< /text>< pics>

Rented from this location during the Super Bowl week.  They unfortunately didn't have the type of vehicle that I hoped for, so they went above and beyond, calling around to the nearby locations finding me what I needed.  I've been renting with Enterprise for years now and the facilities are hit and miss.  This location and this outstanding staff is the reason I'm a loyal Enterprise customer.  Thanks guys.< /review>

I love Enterprise and will continue to use their services, I was just unhappy with my last rental from the Berkeley office.
-The car was pretty dirty when I picked it up (nasty stuff on the inside of the door, trash in the center console, smudge marks everywhere, etc.).
-The windshield was not only dirty, it had a strange film on it that made it very difficult to see when it was raining out. Hard to explain, but it was not safe.
-When I picked it up and drove it off the lot I was surprised to see that there was less than a quarter tank of gas in the car.
-I rented an "intermediate" sized car hoping for some more comfort, but the car really didn't operate well at all. There were problems with the accelerator and the brakes, which made driving trickier.

I've certainly had much better rentals through Enterprise, this was the worst one I've had. I'm not sure why they decided to rent this particular vehicle, in my opinion it should have been pulled aside for service and properly cleaned.
I'd caution renters to check the gas level and the cleanliness of the vehicle before driving off from this location, although I don't know how you'd address the functionality of the vehicle.< /Review>

Overpriced filthy low-end cars! I couldn't believe the complete opposition between the "enterprise ideal service" that is sold via their advertising and the horrible service that I've received at almost ALL enterprise car rental locations. This company is setting itself up for a false advertising suit... I've had better service at budget..<//Review>

I have been renting from Enterprises for years. Most of the rentals from the San Pablo office.  Due to lack of selected vehicles and no full tank required upon renting anymore, I started renting from the Berkeley office.
May 12-14th of 2018, rental was a nice 4 door Honda.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly (at both locations) and waiting is "no waiting" (if picking up car upon opening).
I was disappointed upon arrival because the car wasnt as clean as I thought upon choosing. I did noticed the bumper was dirty and informed the employee (dirt and mostly dead bugs).  The paperwork was completed and upon preparing to drive off the lot, I couldn't see thru the windows clearly due to water stains and dust.
This could possibly be accepted, if I was a walk-in, but my reservation was made online in advance.
I immediately notified the employee and was informed it will take 15 minutes due to another vehicle being washed and cleaned.  Well, 15 minutes I didnt have and no, I didn't want another vehicle or pay $5 for an upgrade.  I paid the money to pay for what I wanted and wasn't pleased.
The supervisor should make sure ALL vehicles are cleaned first thing in the mornings (clean the windows with Windex and re✔️ the interior as well before opening); especially when they are parked outside 24/7.
So, here I go.  A nice car with dirty windows and dead bug stains on the bumper.
Hire some1 who will do their BEST because that's how they are, no matter what their job decriptions are.  Needing a job sometimes doesn't qualify quality of work.< /Text>

<Review>Unbelievable how rude every single staff member at this location was. We arrived right before our reservation time, only to find the place locked. The staff completely tore us apart, saying that arriving at 11:30 for a 12pm pickup was "assholish." Other customers arrived after us and were totally turned away, yelled at and cursed at behind their back. To the staff: if you lock the door at 11:50 and feel the need to treat your clientele like garbage, please don't accept car reservations for 12. It's unprofessional and just plain gross.< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Everything went great :) I had rented a car in L.A. and delivered it here again and everything worked great. Short joint inspection of the car, then get the bill and I was ready. Everything in under 10 minutes and friendly service. Therefore: Only to be recommended :)

(Original)
Lief alles hervorragend :) Ich hatte ein Auto in L.A. gemietet und es hier wieder abgegeben und es hat alles super funktioniert. Kurze gemeinsame Inspektion des Autos, anschließend die Rechnung bekommen und schon war ich fertig. Alles in unter 10 Minuten und das bei freundlichem Service. Von daher: Nur zu empfehlen :)< /Review>

< Review>
I want to start off by mentioning I have never provided a review on an establishment before; however, after my experience at Blue Granite today, I felt compelled to do so.

My two sons ages 8 and 12 have shown a recent interest in learning to climb. I took them to Blue Granite on a Saturday at around 10am and was immediately greeted by a very professional young man (Ivan) at the front desk.

Ivan welcomed my family and I and squared my boys away with some climbing shoes and harnesses. We were provided a tour of the beautiful facility and given a very thorough introduction to safety and climbing.

It was not long and my boys were literally climbing all over the walls in the gym.

The facility was exceptionally clean and the other patrons were friendly and helpful to my boys.

Our day pass afforded us the opportunity to leave for a few hours and return at our leisure. We left for lunch and visited family in West Shore then returned the same evening for more climbing as the boys couldn't get enough!

We live in Pollock Pines and will definitely be back to attend more classes to better our knowledge in safe climbing practices with hopes to take this outdoors during the spring and summer months.

Thank you to Ivan and the Blue Granite team for such a memorable experience.< /Review>

I don't think I've ever written a business review, but i am so grateful for Blue Granite being built in South Lake Tahoe. My previous residence in Paradise CA had no indoor climbing for 100 miles. This has helped me reignite my passion with rock climbing.

A minor addition i wanted to add is that they no longer have a coffee bar, but i never got coffee there and i dont think many members did. Still remains a 5/5 climbing gym for all of its other awesome features.< /Review>

SHAME on you, Blue Granite. I called ready to pay for the discounted 30-day membership at $55 today in order to exercise before my full-time job due to the smoke, and not only was I treated extremely poorly by your very inept and incompetent “front desk manager,” Henry, I was also told I couldn’t pro-rate 10 of my 30 days due to the fact that I would be flying out of state for 10 days in that bracket. I wasn’t even ASKING for a discount, just some calendar  flexibility. Sorry not sorry, but in the world of small local community businesses, you should be more flexible to the needs of your established local residents.

Reprehensible way to treat your community members, I will be taking my business elsewhere.<//Review>

Friendly helpful staff. Nice high walls. Fun place to climb for out of towners who may not have time to go outdoors or if the weather is bad. The Refuge cafe also has great grilled Cheese and smoothies. I recommend the blueberry smoothie with espresso beans. It's  delicious.< /Text>

Fantastic team, great climbing facility. Took their introduction class and for 1.5 hours I learned so much and came back to actually climb and purchase gear. The staff was so helpful and welcoming, bought their punch card pass. Looking forward to more climbs!</review>

It was difficult for us to chose only one of the many dishes on the menu!

The chili rellenos were some of the best we have ever had. The birria was new to me and was fantastic.

Sad for us that we will most likely never eat here again but given the opportunity we will make it a priority.

Very satisfied with our meal!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6LEtibPxXLhGLI3WcT3UrWLiOIZVLWn6R02Gb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcmVWFOj_h6t5bVyZ4ZNC5-0OSKqgR0N3HxHQZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<Text>Picked up an order. Barely any meat in my burrito it was basically all rice. The food has no flavor at all I wouldn’t call this Mexican food. Many other Mexican restaurants that offer better quality for the same price< /Text><gmap_id>0x80904fbd3ceb5eed:0x1ab6c87fe6cc5fd3< /gmap_id>< Rating>

Been here a few times. Everything I've gotten has been GREAT except for a torta I had the other day. Very little meat or anything else and no flavor. Surprised because of all the food I've had so far has been really GREAT.

Just one concern is that they don't speak English very good. I don't have a problem with it I can speak Spanish, but a friend I went with one time he doesn't speak Spanish and say he'd probably wouldn't go back just cause of that. He really enjoyed the food also.< /text>

<name>Shawn Posey</name><date>1567194794555<//date><review>I reserve this rating for the very few...  this place is LEGIT!
Stopped by on the first visit, grabbed a burrito and from the first bite I knew this place was special.  The meat has excellent seasoning, fresh fixings on the inside served with pride by a staff of family.
It is one of those meals you just keep thinking about, long after mealtime.  It is that good.

Second visit (only a few days later) tried the tacos de adobada.  BOOM! The fresh pressed tortilla complemented the marinated meat, with a little guacamole salsa and salsa verde (they bring you an array of choices for the sauces)... three wasn't enough (oh, believe me... I WAS FULL)... I ordered two more... this wasn't because the portions were small... I just wasn't ready to quit eating yet.

Stupid 3-day weekend... I eat here during work, now I'm three days away from trying the next menu item.

If you are traveling on the freeway, this is literally two blocks off the exit (just over the railroad tracks-easy on and off with VERY quick service); it will NOT disappoint.<//review>< Pictures>

No way anyone who likes good food would give this place more than  1 star.Hands down worst Mexican food ive ever had.Skimpy and flavorless.Salsa is horrible.I shoulda known it was bad when i walked in and the tables that weren't cleaned yet stil had full bowls of their terrible salsa.Im a food connoisseur and know my food.Take my word any taco truck in Salida is sooo much better than this place.I doubt there in business 3 more months</text>

I was expecting better customer service from this place. My friend and I ordered their sandwich special for the day and when we asked about the price the woman was very stand offish and unwelcoming to our questions, very strange! The sandwich itself wasn’t bad but wasn’t great either which was the pastrami. I would of expected more from a $15 sandwich because we definitely didn’t get the service we deserved either!<//Review>

What a wonderful special place. Every item on the menu is completely unique and everything looks tasty. Anxious to try everything. 25 cent coffee on Wednesday mornings. Their pastries look too sumptuous 😆< /text>

They were out of half their menu and as COVID Cases in CA surge, no employees had masks, not even around their neck and had patrons inside with no masks, no signs or anything. Blatantly disregarding state health regulations. Can’t say for their food quality as we moved on. So if saving lives and being ethical about COVID is important to you, avoid.</review>

There is a large selection of food as well as baked goods. The breakfast burrito and the gluten free lemon bars are my favorite! Also, they offer biscuits and gravy on Sundays and it was delicious as well. The staff was great and accommodating. The newly renovated facility is very nice also!</Text>

Don’t bother with this place, unless you’re a regular, because otherwise they’ll take 25 minutes to finish a single sandwich and do other orders before yours. It took them almost half an hour to complete a CAPRESE panini - literally cheese, pesto, tomato, and I couldn’t even eat it because it was soggy and sour and barely the size of my palm. (Mind you it was $10) The staff looks like they hate their lives - caaant image why - and will give you the sub par service you love. They also won’t apologize for their mistakes, they’ll mutter “sorry” under their breath and walk away. Try again.< /Text>

This was an amazing experience and one that was on my bucket list. Sheldon is so awesome and makes it an experience of a lifetime. For the price, this is a great deal. They even have coffee and snacks for you on board and champagne after the flight. I also liked that you take off from a boat so get great pics of the mountains from that perspective as well. Book this experience, you won’t regret it!!</text>

Beyond exceptional experience! The crew was professional, knowledgeable, and ensured everyone felt safe and had fun. The pilot was very skilled and made a good effort as a tour guide floating above Lake Tahoe. The included snacks and champagne rounded out the whole experience. Will do again!< /review>

< Review>
We booked a flight this winter. It was a great experience from A to Z. Our pilot was Sheldon, he is a passionate guy who will do everything to entertain you and share his passion. You can feel he is happy to do his job! He will explain you the history of air balloon and you can see the crew set up everything for you ( and you can help at the end if you want! Lot of fun ).
These people are really nice and I highly recommend. They will make sure that your experience is the best one.<//Review>

The session started with onboarding at 5:30am, but I forgot my time flow for 4 hours until landing. It’s spectacular to look around all 360-degree scenes immediately at higher than 11,000ft :) If you are a newbie like me for Lake Tahoe in the early summer season, this is the thing you have to do. You’ll never regret the choice!
I also appreciate the staffs service. They’re really professional 👍</Text>

Absolutely amazing experience!! Cool boat ride, can't beat the views from the balloon, and the crew are all awesome! My mom hates adrenaline activities and she even loved this. It's so peaceful and beautiful. Book early in your trip and be ready to be flexible with weather conditions. So worth the money!!< /Review>

{'time': 1604348353123, 'text': "Hello Brianna, we regret more than anyone not being able to fly you. We were sold out the day you were booked and the last thing we wanted to do was leave you disappointed and there's nothing we love more than a beautiful day of flying over Lake Tahoe. Don't forget, we lose revenue when we cancel. That said, safety is always first and the forecast isn't always accurate. We base our decision off the real conditions the morning of the flight.\n\nI'm sorry you felt our communication was insufficient or lacking. We communicate very clearly to guests that they are to call our weather check in line an hour prior to their flight. We have found that asking guests to call us is the most reliable and effective way for them to get the message. It avoids issues with the infamously poor Tahoe cell connectivity, voicemail boxes that have not been set up, errantly entered phone numbers, dead phone batteries, etc. Email works only when people remember to check it at 5AM and text messaging again only works if the phone has signal and allows very limited characters to explain why we've canceled. When guests call our weather check in line they can use any phone with a signal and it gives us the opportunity to explain why we regretfully had to cancel.\n\nWhile your satisfaction is very important to us, we value keeping you safe above all.\n\nSincerely\n-Gabriel Gundling\nOwner/Lake Tahoe Balloons"}<//Response>

Flight cancelled due to high winds..0 MPH winds in the forecast for the day. Specifically came from out of state to do this. Didn’t get any phone call or email about cancellation, called while on the way to the site to find out it was cancelled. Very upset with the lack of communication on their end. Wouldn’t recommend.</Text>

Amazing experience. This was a belated birthday gift for my dad. We had the perfect morning weather with clear skies and a comfortable temperature. The crew took excellent care of us and was proactive about answering questions and making sure we were having a good time. The pilot and the captain were both highly skilled and made the entire process seamless and smooth. They provided a good variety of snacks and drinks to appeal to a range of preferences. We took beautiful pictures and had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend Lake Tahoe Balloons!</Review>

Safely always comes first and while the wind at Lake level may have been calm, the concern is the winds at altitude where the balloon actually flies. If conditions are unsafe we will not fly.\n\nIn regards to your claim of "no refund," we don\'t refund for charges we have not made. Our online booking form and our reservations staff communicate very clearly that we do not charge until after the flight and our confirmation emails specifically state:\n\n"Bookings are simply held with a credit card number and not charged until after the flight. Please checkout with your preferred method of payment post-flight or we will charge the card on file."\n\nAdditionally in your confirmation email it specifically states "If we cancel your flight for any reason, no charges will be made."\n\nSo to be clear, we canceled your flighted due to weather and therefore, you have not been charged. There is nothing for us to refund. You can confirm this by checking your credit card statement where you will see no charges from Lake Tahoe Balloons. If you chose to rebook, please read your confirmation email thoroughly as there is important information within.\n\nSincerely,\n-Gabriel Gundling\nOwner/Lake Tahoe Balloons'}<//Response></record></dataset><record>

We won\'t risk your safety to make a dollar even if that means disappointing you.

Our pilot and boat captain combine for well over a decade of experience evaluating the weather in the Lake Tahoe region.

My girlfriend and I had been wanting to go up in a hot air balloon for a long time. We finally got to go and it was such an incredible experience. The whole team at Lake Tahoe Balloons made us feel safe and were so knowlegable about the history of Hot Air Ballooning and of course Lake Tahoe. It is one of the best views you will ever see of Lake Tahoe and I highly recommend going on your next trip to Tahoe or if you live here.< /review>

The staff was friendly and informative! Linda was great with keeping us updated. Captain Sheldon was amazing from his flying to his stories and knowledge of the area. He taught us a lot. He touched the clouds for me to get my bucket list item!! This was a must do trip! I would recommend to anyone to go. Views are beautiful and experience of a lifetime, Thankyou to all the staff for making our experience amazing!<//text>

This must rank as one of the greatest experiences of my life.  The sky was blue, the water sapphire, the balloon red and yellow-perfect colors.  We could see how difficult it is to launch a balloon and how the crew worked collaboratively to make the experience happen.  But the liftoff from and the landing  on the boat made the experience unique.  Captain Sheldon took pictures of us, explained the history of ballooning, played music to fit the motion, and made us all laugh.  At the same time, we felt complete trust in his skills.  All the time he was in direct contact with the boat.  As they all said, "Safety first."  The ride is not cheap, but you will not regret spending the money on a once in a lifetime experience.</Text>

If you ever have the chance to do this ride do not miss it. It is absolutely spectacular. We were there on our 30th anniversary. The pilot Sheldon and the boat captain Greg are top shelf guys. The crew was helpful and courteous.  This the only place in the world you launch and land on a boat in the middle of a lake. Stunning Lake Tahoe. I'd give it more stars if I could.<//review>

This was one of the most epic experiences I've ever had.  When you get there you will immediately realize that you are in great hands with the staff.  George greeted us warmly, and with a quick signature we were off to the boat.  The staff goes out of there way to make you feel safe and it was comforting to be informed of their precautionary measures.  The whole staff introduced themselves, and Greg, the Captain of the boat stood out as being really friendly and knowledgeable about the area and balloon.  The boat ride itself is beautiful and exciting (knowing you are about to be up in the sky).  The main event was unlike anything I'd done before, watching the balloon inflate just added to the anticipation.  The pilots name was Sheldon, and he was amazing.... his enthusiasm rubbed off on everyone, and you could tell he was incredibly skilled with the balloon.  The tricks he pulled off with the balloon were incredible.  He touched down into the water twice, got up to 2500 ft above the lake, and literally grazed the trees! It was absolutely amazing and I want to go up again!  If you've never been in a hot air balloon, or even if you have, call up Lake Tahoe Balloons and try this incredible experience out!  Shout out to Greg, Sheldon, Blake, George, and the rest of the staff!

<Review>This was one of the most incredible things my husband and I have ever done, and to be able to take off/land on a boat (the ONLY hot air balloon experience like this) AND soar over Lake Tahoe while in the balloon (seeing the lake from a totally different perspective) made it an experience we will never forget.

The uniqueness of it all would alone make it special, but it was smoothness and professionalism of the entire operation - from set-up to the champagne toast - that makes me want to make sure EVERYONE spends their dollars here. The crew and pilot were outstanding -supportive, informative, friendly, and FUN - and customer service came naturally to each one of them. This is a great company with great people working for it, and a true gem at Lake Tahoe.

Don't miss this opportunity, worth every dollar!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Wonderful experience with a nice boat tour on the lake
the crew was very nice.We saw balloon inflate and deflate very entertaining.The view of Lake Tahoe was gorgeous.
The souvenir champagne glass   with poem on it was a very unexpected gift.It was my birthday treat so even nicer.Very hot in basket from gas being released so do wear layers so you can undress you will probably need to even on chilly mornings.
I would highly recommend for a once in a lifetime experience.<//Text>< Pics>

Gabe the pilot is a master at his craft - skimming the Lake, gentle landing on a boat, knowledgeable of the area and ballooning.

This was our 20th anniversary. It was wonderful. I thought I would be scared because of the heights, however it was wonderful. It goes up subtly and gradually. You don't even know you're moving even going in the middle of the lake. Looking back toward the shoreline is absolutely breathtaking. The winds were calm. The water was calm.  It was just so serene and peaceful. Breathing the clean air was absolutely refreshing. I would suggest this for anybody who wanted to do it. The only thing I would suggest depending on where you're from would dictate how you are dressed. We are from the Seattle area and we did not need to dress as heavy as we thought we needed to be. Yes it is hot in the basket so wearing a hoodie with a couple layers of clothes is way out of the question. The morning was beautiful but as the day progressed it did get very warm. We were back by 11am. So dress accordingly to how you normally would. Everybody was wonderful. Can't say enough about the crew. They're just wonderful made everybody feel at home. It was like a bunch of friends going out on the lake.< /Review>

{'time': 1499731029019, 'text': "Dear Reviewer,\nThank you so much for taking the time to review your phone experience with our office staff. We very much pride ourselves in our customer service and your feedback is valuable. I sincerely hope that your call was somehow disconnected or dropped rather than one of our office staff hanging up on you, however, if they did hand up on you, I'm so very sorry. I have spoken to all of our phone staff and shared your concerns with them. They are all aware at how disappointed and dismayed I was to read about the experience you described in your review. Our pilots, captains and crew are so dedicated to providing you a wonderful experience that it's heart breaking to see the office dropped the ball. I sincerely hope you give us all a second shot.\n\nTo answer your question about why we were closed when you called, we are weather dependent so our season runs mid-May through October. The lake elevation of Lake Tahoe is over 6200 feet and because of that, we can get some pretty extreme winter weather. With temperatures often dropping below freezing at night and remaining below freezing for extended periods of time during the winter months, the marina where our boat is docked often freezes solid. This makes it impossible to get out of the marina to the lake. In addition, our winter storms often bring strong winds. Strong winds are not favorable to balloon flights over Lake Tahoe. Thus we wait until the weather improves in May before we start flying.\n\nAgain, I appreciate your feedback and am very very sorry for your experience on the phone. I do encourage you to give us another chance because between our fantastic Tahoe team and the spectacular Lake Tahoe views, I truly believe you will have a wonderful time.\n\nSincerely\nGabriel Gundling\nOwner"}</resp>

Extremely rude and unprofessional ! I live in Oregon and I'm down here on vacation and decided since I have never been in a hot air balloon that I would try it out. I called this place this morning the lady who picked up the phone said they were closed until next May and when I said aw man how come ? And I proceeded to tell her that I was visiting and the lady straight hung up on me !!! So disrespectful and rude and unprofessional</Text>

<time>1619830359243< /time><rating>1<//rating><text>I've been to this salon multiple times in the past, but this last time was the worst hairstyle I have ever had in my life. Kathy has already been rude and unprofessional with me in the past, but she never did such a poor job on my hair. It's not toned correctly in the front. It's uneven and partially brassy (circled in the photo). Furthermore, I asked for a trim of 1-2 inches and instead I essentially got a feathered bob. I had to call multiple times to speak with the owner who finally said I could be refunded. But, first I had to speak with Kathy who refused to apologize and acted like she was doing me a huge favor by fixing my hair that she ruined. I also had to buy halo extensions because this is literally a look I would never walk around with the Karen hairstyle she gave me. If you go to this salon don't see Kathy unless you want to carefully dance around her catty conversation and comments while she's doing your hair and you want your hair ruined.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd7BM0fiei1jpqnojcY7wLTR2McgqFqIaG5u4c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808f874327af2073:0x5e28a3bd96b8b9de</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had a fabulous cut and color with Diane. There were limited people in the salon, and everyone kept their masks on. She did a gorgeous very natural blonde balayage  and an adorable cut. She did a great shampoo and scalp massage too! I'll be back. Also the 20% off for new customers is awesome!< /Text>

<review>Went in to get blonde hair, came out with grey and blue. And I don't know if the worst part was that the lady tried to hide her mistake by turning me away from the mirrors or that her solution to fix this was "just wash it enough and it will fade"< /review></record></dataset><record>

Trying out a new place is always a gamble.. But they are SO deserving of 5 stars! The salon itself is clean and cute, well kept, and the workers are all very kind.

Jennifer did mine and my boyfriends' cuts, and they were both perfect! For his, she trimmed his beard and neck, and evenly cut his hair. He's picky about the style (professional but handsome), and she did a wonderful job making it look exactly the way he wanted. It took roughly 30 minutes, so she really took her time making sure it was done well. For mine, she cut based on a simple photo-- I was cutting a lot of hair off so going from long to short can be a tricky change, but she perfected the cut from every angle and made sure it was evened out and looked nice. I'm extremely picky about my cuts- I have fine hair, but a LOT of it, so any mistake is highly noticeable.. but her cut was flawless. I can definitely recommend Jennifer at L'amor and I WILL be going back to her!! Keep her around L'amor, PLEASE!< /Review><rating>5<//rating><Gmap_id>0x808f874327af2073:0x5e28a3bd96b8b9de<//Gmap_id><response>None< /response><user>110417126451078659629<//user></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I am new to the area and looking for a place to have my hair cut and colored. After reading very good  reviews on yelp, I chose this salon. My appointment was with Brian and although I was initially nervous, I had no reason to be! He gave me a great hair cut and evened out my color that had turned quite brassy in some areas and stayed dark in others . The compliments on the cut I have been receiving range from nice hair to sexy hair and 'it makes you look younger". Can't ask for more!< /Review>

The lady that did my hair there was extremely nice and very informative about hair care for my hair but when it came to fixing up and cutting my hair it came out extremely uneven and I didn't even notice until I got home(because my hair was a huge fluff ball) that there's a long tail in the back. Everything else is okay-ish for what was there to work with(there was a tragic accident where my poor beautiful hair caught fire and left my hair in uneven patches 😭😭😭) but it still could've been cut a lot better and I could've not had a dang freaking tail in the back of this wanna be Bob.
She could've gotten a wayyy better review because  she was extremely nice and great customer servicer  but because of this tragic "fix" she gets 2stars...

RACIST ASS PEOPLE.
There are plenty of other salons who do hair.
The difference between this salon and any other salon which I will be going to from now on.... is how you treat your customers.
You will not have a successful business if you don’t treat people like human beings.
You can’t tell a girl that her hair is too difficult to work with without even looking or feeling the texture of her hair. People with decency don’t judge people by their color.
WARNING: IF YOU HAVE “difficult” HAIR WHICH I THINK IS MOST PEOPLE.
DON’T BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE.

Plus if you read the other reviews they’re trash. One girl walked in wanting blonde hair came out with blue. 🤷‍♀️
I’m just saying. Don’t do it.< /Review>

The hairdresser who worked on my hair and the other staff members were all super friendly and welcoming and I was delighted with the end result! My hair is platinum blonde and I’ve had trouble in other hair salons with getting the colour exactly right but it was perfect here! Will definitely be going back!</review>

For $25 for a men's haircut and wash, it is quite reasonable. Nice space with lots of natural light, too.</Text>< pictures>

<text>I started at L'amour when they were on Grand Avenue.  Kathy has been doing my hair for a couple of years now and she's always done my hair just right, so when I leave the salon, not only does my hair look fantastic, but I feel good about myself, to boot.  The new location is so much larger, airier, and brighter.  Plus, they can assist several more people at the same time.  In terms of price, they are appropriate for the area and service delivered.  My last "major" treatment was the Brazilian Blowout - and wow, did my hair look and feel sleek and frizz free free for months!  So worth it!  If you're not sure if this salon is for you - I urge you to give it a try - I think you'll be glad you did.<//text>< rating>

I came to L'amor looking for a particular Bumble and Bumble hairspray I had seen on their shelves previously. They were out of it, but the owner tried to tell me the product had been recalled by the company so she could sell me something else that was not even close to what I wanted.
This was an outright LIE.
The product had NOT been recalled and I proceeded to take my business right down the street where they had shelves of it in stock.
In case you are wondering, it was also in stock and not recalled at Ulta and several other local salons I called. Nobody had heard of any recall, nor was any recall of ANY B&B product mentioned on the B&B website or anywhere on the internet.</text><Rate>1<//Rate>< Pics>

I visited this salon for the first time a few days after it opened, and I was really shocked with what a great haircut and amazing service I received.  I think I will be switching from my normal hairdresser in Berkeley and driving over to Oakland instead.  I would strongly suggest giving this new salon a try.< /Text>

Hairstylist didn't even do a consult and/or go over what I want/how it will turn out. Naturally, I have dirty blonde hair and I've been highlighting it for 15 plus years. WORST HIGHLIGHT EVER and WORST STYLE Blow-dry. hair is broken and damaged and she used purple shampoo after highlight; never should that be done.. Now my highlights have a purple tent to them. All in all, I left the salon with darker blonde hair than when I walked in. Prices quoted will be more expensive when you check out and pay. I would rate this experience -10 if I could.<//Text>

ROSS Dress for less is a great clothing retailer for folks on a budget. Some of their clothing might be a bit "irregular"... but who cares when the jeans are just for work or casual wear. But for dishes, patio furniture, home decor... ROSS is the best!!!<//Text>

Love this branch! Through the years I have scored great bargains
(designer jeans $50 marked down to $9.99 - bought two pair)
Whenever the Hwy 101 North traffic is horrific - many of us pull over - kill time and shop at Ross.</review>

<review>Pretty Consistent - hard to walk out of the store with our finding something so discounted and  so cool. Shoe Dept is hit or miss. Lingerie Dept is small, however great price point on panties. Impressive selection of Towels - good lables.</review></record>

I made a quick stop at Ross with a few companions after taking a stroll through Target across the big parking lot. The Ross in Marin City was kind of crowded with racks and shelves of clothing, furniture and such. I'd like to add that it was also quite clean and organized. There weren't many people inside around noon on a Saturday. The security guard was surprisingly welcoming, compared to most of the Ross stores I've visited. Prices were so-so and there were one or two registers open.<//review>

Too cool...I needed a cool art option for a particular young friend.  I got a vintage looking Hippie coloring book and the 72 color pencils for $20 and it was a big hit!< /text>

1st of all there is absolutely no one shopping here today. They are in a completely dead shopping center that is mainly vacant in the middle of Marin City.
There are several employees working doing absolutely nothing except talk to each other. I asked one about a luggage bag. Very simple question - like does she know the weight of it. She says she'll get someone else to help. Man comes over says he cannot answer questions. Woman comes back and seems confused that a customer is still there. Man comes back. English seems to be a 3rd language and they have no interest in actually doing any work.< /review>

The mall is getting a face-lift.  However foot traffic is low and I don't think this Ross restock as much as other locations because of it.  Slim pickings but you might find something that other stores are out of.<//text>

Staff here is friendly and fast! Place is clean and well organized. My visits usually take about 30 minutes. Which is not bad at all. Its not over crowded.</review>

<text>I have been to this place twice and both times I was taking care of and did not feel like I was just another body but more like a human being. The wait time can be a little long but compared to other businesses that offer the same services I would highly consider checking this place out. You won't be disappointed< /text></record>

I am the most sensitive person when it comes to any sort of feminine health- the pap and the UDI insertion was seriously so well done. I was informed step by step and it was seamless.

This is my go to clinic the only thing that I would say is a bad experience is that there isn’t much privacy in there . When you walk in a nurse has you explain what’s wrong and there isn’t a door it’s just dividers on a desk to separate you from another person . You can hear what they’re saying about you while you’re in the waiting room . It’s a bit embarrassing that you go into the clinic trusting them to help you and then you hear them shouting things outside the door about you. It’s unprofessional. I wish there was more privacy in this clinic< /text>

Wooohoo! I am so impressed how hardworking and friendly every individual in this office is. Scheduling an appointment online is EASY, they send and remind you of your appointment as well. I have been a patient here for maybe 5 years now and each time I am leaving happy and feel very confident in the services they provide. My Care coordinator Susan was able to explain everything to me clearly. My reason for this review is the exceptional Tierra! She is pure gold! She helped me with my IUD insertion and removal. Tierra is knowledgeable, personable, and very professional. Thank you FPA Women Health Mission Hills office!< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I was feeling nervous about going to a clinic during COVID, but I needed to see a provider about my birth control method. FPA Women's Health Clinic is amazing! It's located on the 2nd floor in a business building and there's a large parking lot behind the building. The chairs in the waiting room were spaced out, masks were required, and the clinic was clean. The medical assistant who helped me and the PA Tierra were so kind, patient, and quick! They answered all my questions. I was in and out after 1 hour. I will definitely be back for any of my reproductive needs!</review>< pictures>

< Review>
I had an horrible experience here. The ladies that help you get set up are wonderful. However, the ultrasound tech, Tierra and her assistant are the worst. I could hear them talking about me and saying MY PERSONAL stuff out loud and everyone else could who was waiting. All 3 of them weren’t at all considerate of my feelings. I’ve read good reviews about Tierra and I was expecting her to be nice to me as the other people have stated. But all 3 of them are the worst and should not at all be working there. I went to a different location in San Bernardino and it was amazing! There’s actually privacy and all the staff are considerate and make you feel comfortable. San Bernardino is worth the drive due to how great you’ll be treated there rather than here.</Review>

This is by far the best women’s clinic I have been to. Compared to similar places like planned parenthood and WIC and even other FPA locations, I have always received the quickest and most efficient care at Mission Hills. I know wait times can usually be a bit long so I try to schedule during the week in the morning and that seems to work out the best for me, I’m usually in and out in an hour. I get everything I need from birth control to annual exams and testing done here and the providers are always kind and knowledgeable. Also, the girls who do the blood draws are awesome. I don’t do well with having my blood drawn but they are super quick about it so I’ve been getting better every time I go in. Highly recommend!<//Text>

This place is a joke. They are completely unorganized and don't go by what time you actually make your appointment. I sat in the waiting room watching people come and go while my girlfriend just sat in the back room waiting.......completely unprofessional.
Go anywhere else. Now to add to my review most people do same day testing......it's been 2 and a half weeks and still haven't got any results back. This place is an absolute joke I wish I could give negative stars.<//text>

<review>Dr Mann is the best. I choose to go here just for her. She's worth the 2 hour wait!!! Most of the girls that work there are friendly but there's a few who could use some better training on how to work with patients. I used to go to facey but once I met dr Mann I changed over to their clinic</review>< Pictures>

The people who work there are very friendly, the place is clean and they have security cameras I felt calm because while I was in consultation my children were in the waiting room I thought it would take hours like other clinics but it was not like that We were in the place less than 1 hour.
Without a doubt, it is the best
I recommend it!!!!!!

(Original)
LA MEJOR CLÍNICA.!!!!!!!!!!!
Las personas que trabajan ahí son bien amables,el lugar está limpio y tienen cámaras de seguridad  me sentí tranquila por que mientras yo estaba en consulta mis hijos estaban en la sala de espera  pensé que tardaría horas como en otras clínicas  pero no fue así el tiempo que estuvimos en el lugar fue menos de 1hora.
Sin duda es la Mejor
La recomiendo!!!!!!</review>< pics>

Great if you want something quick, reasonably priced and healthy. Usually get the chicken bowl always fresh. Highly recommend. Also I think he is the owner he is always at the front he is super polite.<//Text>

Good food. I like their yakisoba! I'm surprised I haven't noticed this place earlier, its close to my house two blocks away. The gentleman in the register could use a little bit more welcoming attitude.

The place is a small hole in the wall type of restaurant. No restroom for customers because of LA health regulation.</review>

Quick, simple and tasty. We arrived just before closing but they were willing to make the spam bowl (a breakfast item) for us because they have the time. That's the type of flexibility/customer service we love mom and pop shops for!< /text>

Food is good, I especially like the chicken there. Portions are pretty big, and the staff is very nice. I suggest you give it a try for a quick bite😊 it's nothing fancy but usually pass by when I get off work.</Text>

<Time>1511209570618< /Time><rate>5</rate><text>Food is always very fresh and hot.  I'm not at all a fan of chicken but I really enjoy their chicken bowl with brown rice.
I'm a big fan of their yakisoba dishes and can't get enough of their beef bowl with brown rice.
The only thing I'm not the biggest fan of is the offering of either,  spicy or not for the spice levels. I always have to ask for medium spice.  The reason I mention this is because spicy is quite spicy, although very delicious.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Best chicken bowl ever.. it's a hole in a wall if you like flame broiler or waba grill.. this place takes them out! Wish it was franchised so they could have more around.. it's family owned .. so you know they're about quality and quantity! Very fresh unique sauce and dressings. Really good mix of flavors.< /Text></record>

<Review>The customer service was horrible.  I ordered a chicken bowl medium for my daughter and she couldn't even eat it.  I asked the owner if he could make another one and you know what he told me NO, that I just wanted a free chicken bowl.  I would go here 3 times a week for lunch and I am very disappointed in the way he handled this situation.  We are a small business to and I know how important it is to keep happy customers and good clientele.  He lost very good customers!!!< /Review>< user_name>

This place is the bomb for Chicken & Beef bowls & plates, their sauces are very good and different from other bowl places. The only bummer is that they now close at 4 pm. That sucks.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Today I ordered a chicken bowl with mild sauce. I brought it back to work and began eating it. It was so spicy that it was unbearable to eat. I called to complain and asked the owner if he could give me a bowl without spice. You know what he said? "NO. All you want is a free meal, It's not spicy." All I wanted was to eat a bowl with little spice and I didn't think that it would've been dealt with by the owners this way. Horrible customer service and they won't be getting my business.

So glad I found this place to fulfill my chicken teriyaki craving near work!

I used to go to Flame Broiler a lot but I wanted to try a different place for lunch. I ordered their Spicy Chicken Bowl with brown rice and it was delicious! The meat was cooked very well and I like the slight spicy kick you get from the sauce. You also get the option to add on green onions, if you want. The service was great and it was reasonably priced. And they give you generous portions!

The only downside is that the parking lot is really small so you may have to find parking on the street.< /review>

<Review>As appetizer we got chips and a sauce of beans which was very tasty. I ordered an Enchilada & Burrito. The Burrito was very good, the Enchilada so so. My friend ordered Enchilada, tamales & tacos of shrimp. The tamales weren't good and the tacos just OK.
The attention was very good.
I would give 3.5 stars, but since there isn't, and attention was good, I put 4.<//Review></record>

<Text>I’m sorry to leave a low rating but the al pastor taco was made with pork that had gone bad. I took more than one bite to confirm, and had my bf confirm who spat it out — the meat wasn’t okay (and it smelled like it had gone bad, too). I get al pastor at a lot of places — there was no mistaking that this one was funky.

The other items (fish taco, shrimp taco, steak fajitas, churros) were perfectly decent! Hence three stars.

But no place should be serving you meat that has gone off. Need some quality control before cooking and serving.<//Text>< time>

<text>While on our way to the Golden Gate Bridge we decided to stop by after looking at the area I was a little weary however breakfast was amazing for all of us!! Although it does look like a place most people just use as a takeout option but they have plenty of seating and are kid-friendly< /text>< pictures>

They wont follow instructions. I asked for nacho fries with everything on the side and they still put beans on it rhe waiter even forgot our order. Took like 20 minutes to get our drinks and rhe drinks were the onlt good part. To make a long story short, i will never come here again and you should NOT come here<//review>

I wanted to give them a second change, came back and got chicken mole enchiladas, the meat tasted bad and meat looked horrible,  and the sauce didn’t taste like mole.
I share my unpleasant expirence with the owner , but she didn’t seam to care not even offered to take some money off my tab to compensated me for the horrible experience.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808f87aa29c86861:0x287a3f95e0b4cd5b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I tried this place couple months ago and was not happy with the food.. ..Today I decided to try it again and well..... Nothing has changed,  food was really bad.  I ordered 2/sopes but was forced to order 3 because they can't only make 2 (makes no sense )
Well they never told me that it comes with beans and rice. Sopes were really bad, bad taste, salsa was not good and did not have flavor.  The only thing that was really good was the beans and rise.  I feel I paid way to much for those sopes that I ended up throwing away.  I would not recommend this place to no one.

Consistently good Mexican fare, awesome burritos and guacamole. I always get the chilli relleno burrito, with chips and guac as well. Very nice people, who make great food for the most part. Chips are a bit lacking in the salt and taste department. The included salsas are also a bit bland, but it's not a big deal.</Text>

Classic typical food, decent prices and attentive service.  This is a good, unpretentious place.  Great to take your kid and not worry about noise.  If you need the food modified, say no chile for a child, no cilantro for an allergic, they are very accommodating. Few selections of chile, other curtido or beers, but adequate.<//Text>

<Text>Great Mexican food. The beans are homemade, you get a basket of chips with beans and salsa while you wait for your food. I had the Taquitos, they were served with lettuce, sour cream and pico. My children had the chicken wings with fries, and my husband had camarones a la diabla. The food was delicious, the only downside is the location.<//Text>< Pics>

I guess I'm not the only one who put a bad review about this place. All food was flavor less & not good at all. Not worth fighting traffic to come here. Also very expensive for flavorless food. Little Beijing in San Bernardino is way better. This location is just Hyped Up by all the other restaurants in area.</Text>

<review>It is disgusting the way the manager allows her employees to treat customers. I witnessed it first hand and when I chimed in and told the manager that her employee acted inappropriately and rudely. we were greeted by a rude manager who never once listened to what the customer was saying and because I spoke up and defended the customer when I asked for condiments another employee practically threw them at me to the point where they all landed all over the counter.  I was appalled by the lack of Customer service and the lack of respect for their customers.  I will never go back< /review>< Pictures>

Seems like employees wanted to do the right thing, but don't know if it was manager or owner didn't. Keep this up and you will drive customers away one by one.< /Text>

I was given the wrong online order. I left the restaurant and returned with the food to get MY food. They simply returned the bag of food with the other online orders. Shouldn't the food be thrown out??  Covid 19 violation and general food handling violation.</review>

For the price this place charges their pretty stingy with how they serve their plates. Like they literally measure what they give you all the way to the last shrimp. The steak with veggies is xtra charge but now its veggies with tiny chunks of steak. Its turned shady over the years. Used to be super great! Nothing like other Pandas.< /Text>

Good is good,  portion was very small.  The manager was telling at the employees and customers like dogs.  He's going to drive away business.  I know that my company will no longer eat at this location.</Review>

< Review>
Alot of bad reviews and I hate to follow suit but this was not my typical experience at Panda. Food wasn't what I'm use to tasting...only allowing a couple of teriyaki sauces is ridiculous cause COVID doesn't have anything to do with teriyaki sauce I hope...<//Review>

The Beijing beef and broccoli beef were fairly ok.  However the rice which was supposedly "fresh" had multiple clumps of hard rice that were inedible.  I posted a photo of this disgrace.   This has occurred before at another Panda Express in Fontana on Cherry.  Really Panda Express?  One of the cheapest and simplest food to make and you decided to sell your customers sub-standard food because you can.  Very disappointing.  No more Panda Express for me.  I can screw up rice at home for much less money .</text>

Bad service and got an upset stomach from the food, it was not fresh. Nancy wanted to over charge me and was refusing to take back something I didn't order. She grabbed the egg roll from the bag and put it back in to serve  to someone else which doesn't seem sanitary during a pandemic. I could hear her complain about me as I left, not professional. Please do not go here for your safety.< /Text>

Terrible Customer Service with a Manager who lacks what it takes to manage. Rushed while inside the store and in line. I think we all understand how service may be affected due to C-19 but that's not an excuse for bad service. As I walked out I could only say I will never return.</Review>

I love to eat Panda Express food, but the one in Rialto CA, the people there are not nice, they are  so rude to customers all the time, the last day I went still the same, they gave me little portion of food and when you tell them to add to the food they will be mad for customers for no reason< /text>

One day, my grandma died... I decided to grab some Panda to relieve the sadness just a little. To my delight, I was happily greeted by some dude name Cao, or Bao, I think it might've been Jao or somewhere along that name. Nonetheless, this employee was one of the best, if not the best employees I have ever met ever. He did not just have a consistently happy attitude but also treated me with respect and kindness. I look forwards to eating here more often.<//review>

< review>
This restaurant doesn't even deserve the one star that I have given. I ordered 5 plates. 3 plates were shrimp with orange chicken. 1 of the plates of orange chicken came with a penny inside the plate. I drove back to the restaurant didn't want to scare the customers away so I spoke with an employee of panda Express that was outside the restaurant and told her nicely of my situation. 1 of the 2 managers came to me and I explained to her that 1 of my plates had a penny inside the orange chicken. I told her that I just came to return the 3 plates that had orange chicken and wanted my money back. A different manager came and gave me a full refund for all 5 plates but, she then noticed that I had only brought 3..... so she tells me (I gave you a refund for all 5 plates and you only brought 3? Basically telling me a need money back from you (from me), that got me upset and I told her that I deserved the full refund for what had happened. I will never eat at this place again,  disgusted.</review>

I give props to the staff today. The line curved over the entrance and the staff kept attending people the same with a smile. The cooks were working really fast to get the food out to the customers. Very pleased with the food.<//text>

I understand when the cashier frankie explained how the sweet fire come in long pieces now so they only serve them in 3 pieces but my plate has only 2 strips of sweet fire. I payed almost 9 dollars for this plate and for them to serve me 2 pieces of sweet fire chicken pieces is insane.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQAcPAhtvZqE6qMlJ9m4pPInw_A1izQzvmh6ob=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>One day, my grandma died... I decided to grab some Panda to relieve the sadness just a little. To my delight, I was happily greeted by some dude name Cao, or Bao, I think it might've been Jao or somewhere along that name. Nonetheless, this employee was one of the best, if not the best employees I have ever met ever. He did not just have a consistently happy attitude but also treated me with respect and kindness. I look forwards to eating here more often.<//Text>< Rate>

Food tasted fair as usual. The bad thing was the amount of food for serving. I usually dont finish the food but today it got ate and still hungry. Make sure you check the quantity of what you ordered they holding back on food and charging the same<//text>

This was the worst customer service I have ever received. Jocelyn was the shift manager and she was very rude and has no customer service skills. After paying for my food I went to fill my drink and there was no ice. I ask if they had any ice and was told no. I then ask for a refund on the drink. Jocelyn told me to just get the drink because it still comes out cold. I explained to her had I known there was no ice I would never had ordered the drink. I never got a refund and I was told very sarcastically as I was leaving the store to have a wonderful night with a smirk of a smile.</review>

This is the nastiest Panda Express ever! We just order through doordash. I tried to soy sauce and duck sauce on the side and it kept saying merchant will not honor this request. So I said I'm not getting rice, it should be fine. I was absolutely wrong. The noodles were so bland and dry. The orange chicken was good. The black pepper chicken had more peppers and onions than chicken. I will never order from here again!!!< /Text>

I was an employee here. WAS. The job overall is not hard but it took 3 weeks for me to get hired. The managers are friendly but boy do they forget about of things. There was a mix up about my background check and transfers to different stores. I had to call most of the time to even hear a word about the whole situation. The Pay was 14.00 an hour but you worked like 3 days a week and the shifts are 5 hours. The food though was bomb as hell, and as apart of the staff the service was excellent I should say so myself. Always kept clean and overall a very nice fast food restaurant.< /Text>

Employees at Panda Express are outstandingly polite and very good with customers service. I enjoyed very much of their foods and their job performance. But foods portioned very little. Should be a bit generous.</text>

So I usually come to this place and the guys that serve me give me enough food. But tonight is a Monday and this Indonesian looking lady, who seemed like the manager in shift, gave me very little portion. So I told her that there was not enough food in my plate and she just ignore me and told me that that was a lot of food already, she was very rude and unfriendly, she makes me don't want to come to this place anymore at least if she still there.<//Text>

I must tell you I walked in to this store and was greeted with a smile and then I proceeded to place my order and they were out at the moment.  The girl behind the counter was apologetic for being out at the moment and advised me it would be about 5 minutes for my order to be completed and then she asked if that was ok?? I said of course and then I asked if I could at least pay for the order and she said that was fine and after paying she handed me a drink cup and I said what was this for and she said I am sorry you have to wait please help yourself to a drink for the inconvenience.  NOW if that doesn't say customer service .
Sorry for not paying attention to there names please pass on a very happy customer and a big thank you,  thank you ,thank you.<//text>

My dad and I are here from Ohio for work. Went here at 10:15, 15 minutes before they were closed. The manager welcomed us,  they were out of orange chicken and immediately asked by Myron the manager if we minded to wait to have them cook us some. The staff was extremely pleasant and Myron the manager was outstanding customer service. Was very much appreciated after being on the road all day long.<//review>

The place is the best for cultural food and taste, they provide you with many options and the staff there are the best, but you need to make it takeout because oh boy is the line long.</text>

I typically order from here but in this past year they have forgotten to put some items I have purchased. How do you mess up on a order that was put 3 hours prior to me arriving for my order. You had an entire 3 hours to go back and made sure I had everything I ordered, but nope. Plz make sure your customers have everything they purchased, I mean isn’t that part of the job?< /text>

Had to come to the wrong side of the tracks lol. Being a truck driver is not always easy when it comes to getting meals or items you need but Panda Express is really great and just Quick walk all the time for me. Great food and service<//text>

Food is good, service is horrible especially Remely the cashier is very rude and should not be at the front. Instead Ana the person in charge is polite and respectful. Lines are huge and need to be more organized, especially with the T-Mobile give away. I will not come back here again.<//text>

<review>I would never come back to this location ever again, terrible service, extremely small portions of food , when entering this location there were only three ontrays prepared. I had to wait 15 minutes for the basics , teriyaki chicken and mandoran chicken ,orange chicken, and steak, none of that was prepared and there was three cooks. The girl packaging i believe her name is liliana ,started to package our go plates then left to her break without telling another worker, we were still waiting for five entries. She was unpleasant and had no sense of urgency, with a huge line behind me. Overall this is the closest panda to my home and would perfer to drive to another location because of the whole experience. My purchase that day was $40 and will never ever go back. This isnt even worth a star</review><username>Ariel Rubio</username>< resp>

This place sucks, I went with my gf to try it out, the people were stingy with portions and had no flavor.  Never went back, I rather go all the way to riverside, or mr. Yous at least.<//review>

(Translated by Google) More than 1 hour ago we took food from here but the rice had pieces, like hard rice balls, I chewed it very confidently but my tooth hurt when I felt it hard, I do not recommend it.
About an hour ago we were here and had some nasty rice. It felt like old rice in there, I took a mighty bite and hurt my tooth. Do not recommend this place.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Something that stood out in this restaurant is that despite the fact that it is fast food, those who attend and clean the tables make sure if everything is ok or if one is missing something. Thing that when I was at the restaurant La Talapa in Tlaltenango it was not done, and that there were 4 waiters and 1 waitress there.

(Original)
Algo que resaltó en este restaurante es de que apesar de que és comida rápida, las que atienden y limpian las mesas se aseguran si todo está bien o si le hace falta algo a uno. Cosa que cuando estuve en el restaurante La Talapa en Tlaltenango no se hizo, y eso que allá había 4 meseros y 1 mesera.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>
