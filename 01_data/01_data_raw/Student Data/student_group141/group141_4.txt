< review>
This place is a gem. Martin and Raul are such easy going and nice brothers.  Robbie's has extremely fair prices for work that is done above and beyond.   I brought my 1987 ford f150 to get the daunting flywheel and clutch replaced, and they got it done pretty quickly. Truck is running great and couldn't be happier.  10/10 would recommend to anyone< /review>

He actually dug into the engine to see what was really the issue and provided me with a good price of labor and using OEM parts. A cam phaser had to be replaced and the OCV as well. He also met the time he said it would to take to fix the car and always gave me updates. Go check out Robbies automotive! They will be having my business for my next automotive needs :)<//Text><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

The team here was very helpful and professional! I came in for an oil change and they did that and checked my tires since the air pressure light was on. I'm so happy I dropped in! Thanks again guys! I will definitely be recommending this place and making it my new spot! Happy Holidays!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Highly recommended by a few mechanics, not just my usual. Mine couldn’t do the Water Pump work so he sent me here and I was very impressed by the service and price. Good turn around time too!</text>

These people were the kindest and fastest workers ever. I went to go get an oil change and they finished fast and professionally. They always know what they are doing and are always kind to answer any questions about your car they can answer. I 100% recommend this place to everyone.< /Review>

I recently took my car here to get the oil changed and had a concern about something wrong with my car that was causing it to shake. Martin assisted me and was really friendly. I appreciated the fact he looked into what I had asked him to check out regards to my car’s shaking and it ended up being nothing. As a young person who doesn’t know a lot about cars, I really appreciated Martin’s honesty about not needing to repair my car yet as I feel I’ve been taken advantage by mechanics before because of my age and not having enough knowledge about cars. They did a great job with the oil change and will bring my car back in the future if repairs are needed. Thanks again!</review>

<review>I’m very satisfied with the job Martin and Raoul performed with my Cirrus .my wife and I have been bringing our cars to Robbie’s the past 20 plus years and we  are lucky to have found people like Martin and Raoul to look after our cars when it’s time. They are very good and knowledgeable mechanics and most of all honest people . I strongly recommend Robbie’s to everyone looking for good mechanics.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Text>I was able to get my car there, I was unable to shift gears from park to reverse. I was shown how to manually change the gears and got it to Robbies. They figured out what was wrong and did the necessary repairs. I am very happy to have the problem resolved and to be back on the road.

I’ve been going to Robbie’s for the past 5 years and I couldn’t be more happy with their services. Raul and Martin are extremely professional and go out of their way to support me whenever I have car issues. Other places try to up sell you and suggest unnecessary repairs, but that nevera happens at Robbie’s. 10/10 would recommend!<//Review>

<response>None</response><text>I gave him 5 stars because he is a good mechanic. He usually gives good prices for repair work. When a tire went flat and destroyed the right side of the car, he repaired all the electronics and windshield wiper tank. This to me would have been the most difficult task to repair. The bumper was also repaired with a standard clip for attaching bumpers but that came loose and I didnt have time to have him fix it.</text></record>

They have been taking care of my Nissan Pathfinder for over 10 years. They pricing is fair, their approach is good - they will tell you what you could/should fix now, what you might be thinking about but don't have to fix quite yet.  The only bummer is that they moved locations and aren't as close to my house, but I expect their success will continue at their new location too.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>They were able to get my radiator replaced the same day so that my road trip wasn't cancelled!
I'm really impressed with their online vehicle report and their great customer service.  The pictures really helped communicate what was wrong with my car. They are the only auto repair place that seems to realize that in the 21st century I can get my car fixed almost anywhere but I'd prefer to do someplace that cares about customer service.
The next time my car breaks I plan on calling them first.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I started going here as a matter of convenience and have not stopped ever since. They are always friendly and have always taken care of me. They offer lots of good advice and are always fair on the price.</text>

Went to get an inspection on a used car I was thinking of buying. They were extremely detailed and charged a lot less than other mechanics I called. There knowledge gave me the assurance I needed before buying the car.<//review>

<review>Robbies might not look very good even downright seedy but they are honest, hardworking and straightforward mechanics.  Yool is a great guy and the owner.  I've been working with him for years and he wont try to upsell you or swindle you. they are flexible w/ drop off and pick up and are pretty timely for the most part.<//review></record>

<Text>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ROBBIES AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE AND REPAIR !!  ONE MORNING ON A COLD JANUARY DAY, MY BATTERY WAS DEAD. MY NEIGHBOR TOLD ME ABOUT ROBBIES, SO WE TOOK A WALK OVER THERE, AND SAUL CAME AND GAVE MY BATTERY A JUMP AND THEN DROVE IT TO THEIR SHOP. THAT WAS THE START OF A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.  I HAVE BEEN GOING TO ROBBIES FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 YEARS. THEY HAVE DONE NEEDED REPAIRS TO MAKE MY CAR FEEL SAFE AND RELIABLE.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCELLENT. I WORKED CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR 28 YEARS. SO I'M A PRETTY GOOD JUDGE OF WHAT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ROBBIES FOR WHAT EVER REPAIRS YOUR CAR NEEDS.  :)< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>All it takes is just one bad experience. To the YOUNG MAN in the padres jersey that stated the obvious it's not Target when I compared a price . Relax go with the flow sometimes. No need to act the way you did, in case you really have to ask way to be RUDE . Why I cracked the Hosmer home run  comment for me to defuse the situation. Your strong demeanor wasn't professional, or  intimidating btw. Don't have to be defensive, unprofessional, and have to rush me out sir. Two stars for actually printng the recipient when I initially declined . Been a big favorite of this place I'll give it a few more tries to hopefully rewrite the review. See you guys on another mine. Would like to see your bosses guide you better. Have a nice one.< /Review><UserId.>111531801866294260727<//UserId.><rating>2<//rating>< gmap_id>

This place is amazing. I was nostalgic for some Fremont Breweries brews from Seattle. They got it in soon after. I've been going there since. Super chill and friendly staff is very helpful with the tasty recs when you want to try something new!

Support your local business! This place is worth it< /Text>

Lots and lots of selection: beers, wines, mixers, etc. Floor-to-ceiling shelves filled with all kinds of alcohol in different flavors. They have a cold room filled with craft beers. Lots of unique alcohol offerings, and there's always something on sale I want to try. Staff is always nice and very helpful. Good prices.< /review>

< Review>
This place made me want to become an alcoholic... JK but the selection they have is awesome... I forgot to the pictures but others have posted many. They have a BEER CAVE yes you had right so what that means for you is their selection and inventory is HUGE. This is a high ceiling business and their selection goes all the way to the ceiling so more benefits for you... More selection and full inventory stock. The staff was super nice and they even offered limes just incase to go with my 🍺🍺🍺. This is my new stop place and parking was not even an issue.<//Review>

<review>Last minute in need of storage space and everything was just not inside my budget.  Trojan storage was not only close to home , but who I really have to give props to is their employee George! This man took me through the smoothest most easy going experience from calling me back on the reservation over the  phone the same day and walking me through the best option of space for me, all in the same day! I recommend nothing else out there for your storage space. I have no doubt that if you leave it up to George he will keep your stuff safe and secure @ TROJAN STORAGE.<//review>< date>

Clean and new facility, but the rent has gotten out of control. Started at 178 per month and ended at 275. Originally, would get quickly returned calls but in more recent times, people often don’t answer or call back.  The office doors are often locked during the day during office hours. This can be inconvenient.  The first month is pro-rated. You are required to give a 30 days notice to leave, but they don’t pro-rate the last month, even though they will likely rent it out quickly and had ample notice.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

These guys are the best!!.  We moved out of state and had movers come to the unit to move our belongs out and the left most of our belongings in the unit.  The staff worked with us to schedule workers to remove the contents and even took a bag with expensive electronics to UPS and mailed to us.</Text>

State of the art storage. Everything about Trojan is 10x better than other storage facilities.

Applaud the owner and operations. Seriously great deals better facilities than anything you'll find.

Incredible front office service Lachelle and the other front desk person (handsome australian man sorry didnt want to get your name wrong) are seriously perfect. Professional, polite, even headed, customer friendly and while I don't recommend doing this, I had temporarily misplaced keys, had movers come to liquidate my design furnishings and drop off items 2x and due to their tight timeline, 2nd time they couldn't wait to have items stored. Lachelle went above and beyond to make sure my items were secure until I could get them into my storage. That is going way above and beyond.

I purchased 10 queen and king size mattress bags which worked great for all the mattress I was storing for staging.

They have great prices on their protective materials and merchandise. It's well worth the $5 to protect a $1000+ mattress set and it fit the king size mattress and boxspring.

The 2 storage 10x10s I rented were immaculate the facility is very very well run, great ac, no dust literally AT ALL, no moisture and I can't have it as humidity ruins furnishings. Well lit, safe, the security codes they have you create for each storage garage controls both the front gate and access to the elevator and keys your smart garage know you're on your way there to access your garage.

I am a super happy customer. Not paid to do this review!!! Just relieved I found you guys when I really needed it and it feels really clean and safe.  Also not crowded though it has the capacity. Smart use of space for lockers that you can keep files in though I needed more space for furnishings.< /text>

Staff is superb, security is excellent (both electronic and physical), and the climate control works great. I feel comfortable and secure with my things here.

<time>1550761917852<//time><Review>Trojan storage is fantastic. Very clean, I never see any trash on the ground. Very safe, your lock is not the only form of protection for your items, in fact many lockers don’t even have a lock on them. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Oh and the reason I found them in the first place, climate control! I know my items will not get warped or harmed in any way by the scorching hot weather of a valley summer.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>Hello I just love the staff here are so polite nice and respectful I love the way they conduct their business and I love the business hours of access until 9 p.m. I wish I could be extended longer sometimes after the holidays I'm running late on my bill payment lost my bank card over the holiday had to order order another one and I missed going to the storage to discuss it them but I'm sure they'll be understanding and it'll all be taken care of anyway I would recommend Trojan storage to anybody I've already referred a few of my friends so I hope that you will want to rent here too also they have double security I just love the security features that they have here on their storage units cuz you can punch your code in at the door and it unlocks your your storage unit if you lock your keys in side or something like that you can still get in your unit I think that's a great feature don't you anyways enjoy your day and have a very smooth day this is Donna Walker< /text>< userid>

Would give five stars but for lack of a restroom outside of office hours. Public storage provides one but they're also considerably more expensive than Trojan, so it's a trade off.< /review>

<review>I went to C and M to get a storage today. I was a little emotionally frazzled but Keehay was so kind. She guided me through the process. Made it simple and so fast. I feel very secure about my possessions.  Keehay is very professional.  There is an app for hands free entry.  I appreciate the fast, easy, friendly caring help. Thank you.

We rented from C & M for 5 years from 2015-2020, until we moved our "stuff" home in order to pare it down.

They are easy to work with,  competitively priced, clean, weatherproof, & SECURE.  Over the years we had zero problems: no pests, no break-ins, great customer service, our gate code always worked, etc.  Highly recommended!</review>

I can't say enough good things about C&M! I've had life possessions ,pictures & furniture in storage. I fell on some hard times, They were allways kind and compassionate and willing to work with me. They made me feel that my unit was safe and secure. Customer service was a plus they always made me feel like Family.. C&M going to miss doing business with you. 2 years later no longer need a unit. Thumbs up!!< /text>

<review>C and M storage is hands down the best storage facility in the ukiah and surrounding areas. From the affordable and very secure units to the extremely helpful staff, in particular the lady KeeHay At the front desk  is always so helpful, she knows all the ins and outs to this facility and will make sure you get exactly what your looking for,  has  A+ customer service and always has a smile on her pretty face while doing so. I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else if your looking for clean , secure, affordable storage units !< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>In the middle of the covid pandemic, I had quite a chaotic move. Some storage unit facilities were closed, and I was stressing out about finding a unit in a timely manner!

<Text>C&M has been so great this past month in between apartments! I had an emergency situation & they were able to accommodate me the same day that I moved out. Keehay has been there every step of the way with me & made it very easy to do all of the paper work & payments in a no-contact way, keeping compliance with the COVID restrictions. The pricing on these units its also very fair & the complex is large enough to offer various sizes. Loved working with C&M!<//Text></record>

In inquiring and setting up an account I found C&M self storage to be very personable, helpful with the details that were hard for me to figure out, and they made it very easy to do all of this over the phone rather than in person.  A great experience.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Keehay, the on-site manager is awesome to work with. The unit is my son’s. He frequently falls behind on his payments because he works at different locations out of town. With his permission, Keehay contacts me when he falls behind. I then make contact with him. He transfers money to my bank account and I call Keehay and make the payment. She is always very pleasant to work with. I know it’s extra work for her to always contact me. Yes, I have a very irresponsible son. She always sounds like she has a smile on her face. We’ve never met as I’m in Southern California. Keehay is delightful to work with. I recommend C & M Storage based on my experience working with her the last couple of years. My son has never said anything negative about C & M Self Storage.<//review>< Pics>

The law only requires that we mail a Preliminary Lien Notice and Notice of Lien Sale. We did both, along with calling the number of record, emailing the email address on file along with sending out 2 additional mailers requesting payment for past due account.  It was explained to you at move in, when you transferred to a new unit and is outlined in your rental contact, that it is your responsibility to update our records in writing if there is a change in mailing address. You came into our office 10/27/17 and updated our records with a new mailing address and verified all other account info to be accurate. Again, we did attempt to call you regarding your card being declined.  I am sorry you feel the need to insult our company because your storage locker was sold due to non-payment.  Thank you.

<text>After being a client for over 5 years, making every payment, they auctioned off my stuff after 3 months of non-payment.  The credit card I had on file expired, and they failed to notify me. They waited the proper amount of time and then sent a letter of auction for lien. Legally it was within their rights, Morally they are corrupt company.  The property is Infested with rats, mice, and cockroaches(see other reviews below).  The management and staff have gone downhill over the years, as I said I was a client for 5 years, and do to the fact their office staff writing my email down incorrectly, I have lost irreplaceable family heirlooms.  3 months of non payment, after 5 years and thousands of dollars to them in on time payments.  Absolutely find another storage unit and DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Also see yelp reviews for some  more honest reviews.

Update:  I was 2 months late on payment and they had an accurate phone number and email, instead they sent notice of lien sale, on the first day they could, to an address that I had made clear I was no longer living at. And called a number I had not put on a previous contract that I was no longer using. Predatory.  BEWARE!!!

Update: After reading your response, my feelings are as before.  You did the legal least required for 5 year client who, was 2 months late due to an expired credit card. I was living overseas, and we had discussed  this personally but yet you sent letters to a house he no longer lives in. And called a number he no longer uses even though you had a current telephone number(international) and an (accurate)email.  Mailings don't work well for those of us who travel, perhaps invest in a computer and send an email.(like most first world countries) Although if you emailed clients they may receive them, handle the problem and you wouldn't be able to  auction the units(which obviously is where the real money lies) since you auctioned a client of 5 years belongings almost to the exact day that you were legally able to.  Again these folks are PREDATORY!!! BEWARE.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Name>

<Review>Very safe and secure place to store your belongings. They have an access gate that only renters my enter. So if your not renting from them your not allowed access. It makes me feel more comfortable storing my belongings. They know who's coming and going. Plus if by chance you accidentally lock your keys in your storage shed the staff is very helpful in cutting the lock for you to gain access again (sometimes I'm a little forgetful, lol). Would definitely use them again.<//Review>< pictures>

Our goal here at C and M Self Storage is for our customers to have and experience excellent customer service and have a clean and safe facility to store their belongings in. Our rental agreement which you agreed to, prohibits smoking\non the interior, loitering as well as sleeping inside. This is a health and safety issue we cannot allow. Our policy when terminating customers, is to give them a 7-day notice. We allowed you two and half weeks to move as a courtesy to you. When customers become hostile to our staff, we have no other choice but to ask them to leave or we will call the police.'}< /resp>

This allows us to close the office by 5 pm. As we explained to you, for after our conveniences, we have several other methods of payment. You can drop off checks, money orders or cashiers checks in our after hour drop slot, call in phone payments, we can set you up for automatic debit or you can pay online. Thank you, Keehay at C and M Self Storage."}<//resp>

Same comment like others. It’s indeed more expensive than other Starbucks. I got a tall pike for $2.91 which is almost C$3.7. I used to have it in Canada for C$2.26. No doubts that the location mainly serves Hyatt guests who find it more convenient than walking to other nearby “regular-priced” Starbucks.</Review>

Waited for 20 minutes. Then finally got our drinks after reminding the people. Drinks were ice cold so we had to wait for our drinks to melt! Hate it there! Never going back to this specific one!</Text>< Pics>

super-convenient for those staying at the Hyatt Regency as it is located inside the hotel. Good for a quick cup of Joe to go while waiting for the valet.</Text>

Dont come here... Their service and product are not worth it. They are over priced and dont carry all starbucks products not only that but if you get anything to eat, they cant heat it up or toast it for you which they dont tell you until after you have placed your order so you get to stand in the lobby heating your food infront of everyone. Not very fun after a long night. The point of a hotel is convenience, this starbucks does not belong in this hotel. Seriously save your momey there is better starbucks in the hotel next door.< /text>

<Review>Add $1-2 per drink at this HOTEL owned Starbucks. No oven to heat food because the HOTEL wants to drive sales at the Citrus Grove Deli with an oven they also own.
Starbucks inside Disneyland is cheaper then this licensed really a franchise location.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Glad to see a gas station NOT ripping everyone off.  Will spread the news of this station via word of mouth, social media, and through various friend/family networks.  Keep up the good work!<//Review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>This is a Sprint store inside radio shack. And when I say store I mean a table at the back corner with one woman and her computer and phone. I came in about cancelling my account and before I even finished my sentence or sat down the woman quickly said she can't help me. I looked confused and asked for further details so she looked at my receipt for 5 minutes and kept shaking her head. She said her system doesn't let her do anything. She was nice enough but still lacked basic customer service skills. She apparently checked with her manager on the phone who told me to go Best Buy because they will definitely handle it (I set it up at best buy). I then went to best buy who actually SAT me down and explained everything and showed me their system telling me they literally only sell phones and can't handle Sprint account related things in regards to refunding my service costs.

Thankfully my Sprint account is cancelled and I don't have to deal with their version of customer support again.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
If you're objective and all you care about is the price of gas and the quality of pumps, then this place is for you! It's usually tied with or cheaper than 7/11, and even then, the pumps are fast and don't take 5 years to fill with like the 7/11 pumps do!</Review>

Consistently great experience and level of freshness. This is by far my favorite BCD tofu house. Tastes better than the restaurants in LA. See photo of side dishes. They always serve ~8 more side dishes than LA locations. Also corvina dinner entree is crispy (can tell they fry in clean oil).</Text>

Terrible foods.  The meat was uncooked on the inside and all  burnt on the outside.  The staffs and the cashiers were very unkind.</Text>

Fullest I've been for $20! Really happy with their service, and my bibimbap came with an intestine soup which was mildly spicy and well balanced. In addition, very generous with the side dishes.< /review>

<review>Korean fast-food serving the regular fare but with great appetizers, especially the fried fish. Kimchi served is not as spicy hot although it's a little salty, as expected. Steamed rice in stone pots and the portions are reasonable, so with the overall price. Good place to have a quick bite if yo like Korean food. Credit cards are accepted, parking is free.</review>< Pictures>

We ended up here on New Years Eve for Dinner before heading over to a party. We were concern about the wait time during dinner hours. To our surprise, there wasn't any wait like Garden Grove or Irvine where I actually walked away because of the long lines.
Food and Staff were excellent. Especially the Squid that is part of the side dishes. I actually bought a jar to enjoy at home.
I would drive here in the future rather than waiting over 45 minutes or more in the other places.<//Text>

So good.  I got the dumpling tofu bowl and hot stone bibimbop combo.  The taste was great.  The service was good but they don't really return to you unless you wave them down.  They were very busy for a 930pm Thursday  evening.  I recommend this place if you want a tofu bowl.</text>

Wow I love this place. At fist I was skeptical because  "tofu house..." c'mon I need some meat!!! But tofu is just the name. The place definitely has great Korean dishes with meat and the soup is awesome. I was thoroughly blown away from my skepticism. They even give you a fish to start off along with all the side dishes. Definitely recommend checking this place out. I would definitely go back.</text>

I love BCD. I was super happy when I first found out this place was going to open awhile back. I have been coming here for years and to this day this location is hands down the best location. The food is consistently good and the service amazing!<//Text>

If you eat in, you get two fried fish each person. The spicy tofu soup is what this restaurant is known for. If you take out, you will get one fried fish per item. The soup is usually 8.99 or 9.99 depending on which you choose. The dishes come with fresh rice, eggs to drop into your soup, side dishes, and toasted rice porridge once you finish.< /text>

Actually i don't eat tofu, but the thing I come for is the hot stone pot with various veggies and your choice of beef or tofu. It comes with all these wonderful side dishes which include a small fried fish, spicy raw squid, fishcake, pickles, bean sprouts,  kimchi and more. The service is great - they cater to my specifics and remember the next time I come!<//Review>

This is a good location of the BCD chain. Good tofu soup, good side dishes, and pretty decent LA galbi too. I've never felt rushed here as a previous reviewer mentioned, but that's possibly a time of day thing I suppose. In fact I'd say the service is well above average for a Korean restaurant.<//Text>

Poor service and food at this bcd location, go to the one on Wilshire or Western instead. At first they tried to seat me at a small table and I asked to sit at a larger table which clearly upset the waitress even though the restaurant was nearly empty. As soon as I sat down she asked what I was ordering and I asked to have some time to read the menu so the waitress left grumpily. I ordered the bulgolgi combo and when the side dishes came out the fish was cold. So they later brought the same fish which I thing they microwaved.  The waitress sullenly scooped out the stone pot rice but didn't put water in it until we called for the manager . The manager was very nonchalant and didn't apologize. When we told him how much better food and service at the bcd on wilshire had his response was he used to work there. So we told him he should run this location the same way as the wilshire branch. My recommendation is to not come to the Buena Park bcd until they improve their service and food.</Review>

Like the food but the price has gone up over the years. Soon will be out of our budget range at 11.99 for the Soon Tofu soup only. Sides are yummy.</text>

My mom wanted to come here for her birthday. We put our name and waited for an hour and 30 minutes. We thought it was because there was no seating but there were 6 tables open that no one was using. Then they called a group of six that just came in and skipped us completely. They claimed that they had already called us but i was sitting right there in front of the list listening for our name. And nope I only heard the names Patricia and Daniel. Then they gave us a menu (we werent even seated) and said "we will come back to you". The guy didnt smile and just gave a blank stare. Smh the previous manager was way nicer. But with the new manager, the place is run without much effort and it kinda shows.</Review>

<date>1547261226179</date><rate>5<//rate><review>(Translated by Google) BCD in Los Angeles is so famous that no explanation is needed anymore. There is an evaluation that it is no longer tastier than before, but you may think that it is a nice taste of Korea for tourists from Korea. You may have to wait a little while in the evening, but it is a Korean restaurant that you can enjoy at home.

(Original)
LA에서 BCD는 워낙 유명해서 더이상 설명은 필요 없을 것 같습니다. 예전보다 맛이 없어졌다는 평가도 있습니다만, 한국에서 오신 관광객들에게는 반가운 한국의 맛이라는 생각이 드실겁니다. 저녁시간에는 다소 기다리셔야 할 지도 모르겠습니다만, 그래도 편안히 즐길수 있는 한국음식점입니다.<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The tofu stew made with non-polluting food was delicious. The characteristic side dish was also good. The lines are long and need patience. There is also a lack of parking space.

(Original)
무공해 식품으로 만든 순두부찌개 맛있었다. 특색있는 반찬도 좋았다. 줄서는 라인이 길어 인내심이 필요하다. 또한 주차공간이 부족해서 아쉬운 점도 있다.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The stone-grilled rice was so hard to chew. My husband ate pork soft tofu and had diarrhea all night. Dingulding oysters that he was sick.. Boiled in the morning to soothe the inside.. I went to a good memory in the past, but I also made a side dish. It wasn't in good condition as if it had been laid out for a long time... and it didn't look too sincere.

돌솥밥은 너무 꼬들밥이라 씹기가 힘들었고..남편은 돼지고기순두부를 먹고 밤새도록 설사하고 배아파 딩굴딩굴..아침에 죽끓여서 속을 달래주었네요..예전에는 괜찮았던 기억에 갔었는데 반찬 나오는것도 만들어놓은지 오래된것처럼 상태가 안좋았고..너무 성의가 없어 보였습니다</text>< GmapID>

Great place to socialize your puppy!

We started taking our puppy to "Yappy Hour" on Fridays 5-6 PM until she hit the 5 month age limit. For $15 each visit she learned to play with other puppies and went from a shy puppy to an energetic and playful dog! Since then she makes friends easily with big and small dogs, and we are able to take her to the dog park without worrying about her.

Compared to our other dog, who is a bit of a "live wire" when it comes to dog-dog interactions, it is night and day. Going to Yappy Hour as a puppy was the best decision we've made while raising our dog!< /Text>

<review>This groomer came as a referral from my vet.  Very glad we went here. Our Shih-Tzu is older and very fussy, they handled her with respect and care. Madison gave her a fantastic shampoo, cut and style. Very professional job at an extremely competitive price. They have a wonderful facility dedicated to grooming pets of most common sizes. In fact they offer self service grooming to which they provide all the materials and tools for a reduced price from the full service. Friendly, fast, organized and quality.< /review><Rate>4<//Rate><user>111969353013718898179</user><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80db7e3aad431e85:0xc48428c00a0baf20</Gmap_id></record>

Really sorry we wasted our money here. They seem to have pretty sever breed bias. At our 2nd group class my dog was labeled as “predatory” because he is a Pitt mix, and he points, no growling, no barking, but some pointing and whining at the beginning of the class. He was dog reactive, which is the reason we had him in training, and although there was never an incident, they made my anxiety spike so high because they Assured me there would be
At some point. When an aggressive dog tried to come in and attack another, my dog began barking to alert and defend the other dog and we were told “if you can’t keep him quiet you’ll have to leave” we stayed through that class, but ultimately we left this trainer with a paid class on the table because we just weren’t convinced that they had any interest in training our very loving and intelligent pup. We now have a new trainer, our dog is making GREAT progress in his reactivity (although Kat made it clear he never would), he’s lose leash walking and is a super star with basic commands after only 3 group lessons with a trainer who accepts my lab/pit mix without breed bias. Bottom line, I would not recommend this business for training.</text>

They also allow you to use their tubs and dryers so you can do it yourself witch allows you to build on that connection.
I truly love the place and highly recommended it.</Review><Date>1574250699417<//Date><GmapID>0x80db7e3aad431e85:0xc48428c00a0baf20</GmapID>< Resp>

No words needed , this is how they did our dog.  Shaved him without us asking them to ~and No he was not matted.  Had the nerve to ask us to bring him back "sedated" so they could do his head.  Sedate our dog for a haircut?<//review>

{'time': 1553715733750, 'text': 'Now let me tell you my side of the story. When your dog was brought in, we told you that it needed to be shaved because of extreme matting. This dog absolutely hates being brushed and getting a bath. And when I say hates, I mean, it sometimes takes three employees to bath this dog. This dog is very aggressive and will bite hard if given the opportunity.  Yes we use a muzzle full time, but when we try to do the head, this dog has a “meltdown” doing alligator rolls and such.\n\nYes we advised this customer to medicate her dog so everyone can feel safe and your dog doesn’t injure himself.'}</Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We usually wash the dog at home, but weather and pre-holiday time crunch had me in search of a self-service location.  The Laundered Mutt fit the bill very well.  Other folks seemed to have the same idea, as the staff was apologetic about how busy they were, but still, things went quickly, and employees were very helpful in orienting me as a first-timer.  They are good with the dogs, have good equipment and wash products, and everything went smoothly.  They have a frequent-flyer reward system, and you can have them do the bathing if you want, too.< /review>< Pics>

excellent facility! Get your dog trained in basic, intermediate, and advanced courses. Grooming is also available in adition to using a tub yourself to wash and dry your own dog. Small shop attached as well. They do great in dealing with my hyperactive lab. Highly recommend!<//Text>

The store was nice enough. The people were helpful. My rating is lower because they couldn't help me. I have a new rescued Pittbull and wanted to board and train. My dog was fine with larger animals but showed too much interest in smaller dogs. I was told that he wasn't a good fit for their program. They did try to help me find other trainers in the area.....we just haven't had luck getting a training program.</Review>

If you are like me and appreciate honesty and integrity then choose this place for your dogs needs. My dog went through the board and train program. I am pleased with the results and appreciated the caring staff and patience they show with owners and their pets. Cat Z is great at what she does. Her knowledge is apparent in her ability to train quickly. I highly recommend this place. I'm going to continue to take all the classes available to us.</review>

<text>I’m torn. My first experience with self-wash was great. It’s a luxury to bathe your dog where someone else cleans up. However, my second experience was horrible. I went in old clothes knowing I would get messy but I didn’t realize is that my dog and I would leave COVERED in another dog’s fur. Your employees know that after you groom a dog there is extra fur. The groomer next to us sprayed us with the groomed dog’s fur. Then she repeatedly blew off herself and the shelf. It didn’t seem to matter to her that when she blew the hair off herself she was directly blowing it onto me. Over and over. Where did she think it was going? I can’t go to a place where the employees have so little regard for other customers.</text><Time>1561830521556</Time></record>

I've taken my dogs to the Laundered Mutt for years now. Great place, friendly staff. I have little dogs, but was amazed they groom large dogs-I mean huge!  Every time I am there, I see Huskies, Rottweilers getting a bath and a blow dry. They are pampered for sure.

My Japanese Chen was groomed there about a month ago and they did a perfect job. Recommend Laundered Mutt whether you self-wash your dog or pay the extra for a Groomer. Fantastic place. Wish they would expand to South Temecula by Red Hawk!< /Text>

Great self-serve tubs and drying stations for do-it-yourself  dog bathing. They supply everything you need; shampoo, conditioner, towels, etc.
My dad and I bathed his 7-yr-old Golden Retriever; everything went smooth and stress-free. Staffed by a crew of devoted dog lovers. Recommended.<//Text>

Love this place.  Cat (the owner) is an amazing dog trainer.  She trained both of our dogs.  They're the only people who have trimmed my dog's nails to my satisfaction.  Cat's husband also makes dried liver treats, which my dogs love!</review>

Great place to take out scared maltipoo, Bella.  They are very kind with her and groom her beautifully.  Prices for a full groom are very competitive and they do a more thorough job than other places we have taken Bella.  They are really fast too.  I was surprised on how quick our dog was washed, groomed, and ready to go home (good for dogs that are nervous about grooming or nervous in general).  Highly recommended!<//text>

<text>I've taken my dogs there twice and so far had a nice experience. They follow directions well and made suggestions when asked. Also, they did not mess up my Pomeranian's haircut like several other places have. They are easy to book last minute because of the amount of groomer they have and their prices are average compared to other grooming places in the area.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
I usually wash my dog with the cold water on the backyard, however could not be done sometimes due to the colder temperature and rain lately. This place is the answer, for $10-$17, they provided everything to do a good complete wash with warm water, you just provide the effort. My mutt smelled as good as he would. I also added nail trimming which was cost very in-expensive. I would considered doing a full dog service next time, as they have a very reasonable charges for dog wash. Great place! Please support this type of small family business, they are getting less numerous by the year as large corporation took over.< /Review>

<text>I was turned away by Petco and Petsmart grooming salons in Menifee today due to my my little dog being scared. I left feeling sad and stuck. I looked up other places outside of Menifee and found Laundered Mutt. I explained to the staff about what happened. They are all so nice and patient.  Kudos to Sydney at Laundered Mutt for sparing alot of time helping me with my dog and explaining how they work . I will definitely continue with them!! Thank you!</text><Rating>5</Rating><UserId.>101667408530458519282< /UserId.><name>Raquel B<//name>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This place is terrible. My wife drove 30 minutes for an appointment she made a couple days before hand and was told she would have to wait 2-3 hours because there were other dogs waiting. Horrible service<//Review>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1522886078051, 'text': 'I’m sorry that your wife had a bad experience today with us. We almost always need about 2-3 hours to allow time to do a quality full service bath on a dog. It takes time to brush out a dog, shampoo them twice, condition their coat, blow dry them completely, clean their ears and trim their nails. Sometimes there is a wait to start on your dog  because we need to do the dogs in the order that they arrive. If you need your dog to be started on immediately then it’s best to set up a time first thing in the morning at 8am. Once again, we are sorry that we couldn’t earn your business today and that you were so unhappy with our service.'}<//Response><gmapID>0x80db7e3aad431e85:0xc48428c00a0baf20<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place is incredible, staff is so kind and they have so much to choose from. Their boot selection is unmatched and if they don’t have exactly what you’re looking for they will design you a unique pair. Highly recommend/a great way to support small business. Also great for kids stuff !<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Great place to buy feed. I have hens so chicken feed and scratch are what I have purchased. Great quality,  certified organic pellets from Modesto Milling. Nice folks, they load your order into the car for you.< /Review>

Went to get pig food and moved my car for the employee who beeped at me. By the time I found a spot to park they were closed and the male employee with the mustache was a complete a-hole. Didn’t ask for me and just shunned me off. I always go there and he’s always a jerk. Last time I’m going there...went to Big Al’s, where I will continue to go!</text>

Needed a single straw bale for archery and they were very nice. Helped me load it up and reminded me how hard it is to get straw out of a car interior before it was in. Would highly recommend.<//Text>

If you ride at San Pascual Stables READ TO THE END! Calling all riders, come to this AMAZING tack and feed shop and get the best service and quality English Riding products! I was looking for tall boots every wear, but they were way to expensive, I came here and I got quality boots for $280! These people are so friendly if you are looking for show attire or just some comfy breeches they will have it! If you can't find one in your size, no worries they will order it for you in time for your next show! If you ride at San Pascual Stables you get a 10% discount! P.S sometimes they have ROCK CANDY!< /Review>

<Text>When the local Home Depots ran our of hay I turned to Damoor's for my Halloween decorative needs.

Damoor's serves the equestrian community in Burbank and as such has plenty of hay (straw) year-round.

It turned out that the bales were cheaper here than at Home Depot; about $2 less at $11 per bale.

I also learned that they will not take the unused straw for health reasons even if you just want to give it back.  Inquire with the stables in the area to see who will take it once you tear down your Halloween set-up.

Price is good. You get quick service. No fuss. Apparently online reservations are recommended but I've walked in the last couple times and had minimal wait.<//Review>

Excellent service from stylist there. Fast and friendly.Good value and happy with outcome. The first review but did return a week later and sadly a very bad experience .Had dropped in early and was advised to return 3 hrs later I did and still waited 15 min and then was quoted a 100 percent increase in the service I had received the first time.
Will not go back.< /text>

The products are great and the service is good, especially if you have your hair colored or coifed by Ashley.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e91478e6839771:0x1c3c9f8fa2819a41<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great job and great haircut. I went in about 12:40 and got an appointment at 1:00. Marque was wonderful in getting me in and out with a very nice hair cut. My wife loved the haircut when I got home. I would highly recommend Marque at Supercuts.</review>< Time>

<user>116176307237372096840< /user><rating>5</rating><Review>I needed a quick cut and I'm only in Santa Barbara for school. I walked in and was immediately helped by Leanna. I showed her a picture of what I liked since I can't describe haircuts very well and she gave me exactly what I wanted! I was in and out in no time, and for a great price, even though the cut looked like expensive quality! Definitely recommend for anyone needing a reliable haircut and they don't want to pay some outrageous salon price! I plan on going back.<//Review>< Name>

<Review>I got one of the worst haircuts I've had in my life here. The asian lady who cut my hair had no idea what I was asking for, and I was told "this is not how we do it in supercuts "!! Well now I can see how they do it and it's absolutely horrible.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I had a horrible experience at this place and I decided to not get my hair done there. Woman was nasty , mean, rude, and not empathetic at all about my situation. I was late, but I explained to her I could not find parking and could not locate the parking lot. I am at another Supercuts now. They were even nicer and much more helpful in the phone. Parker had a great phone presence. Do not go there.</Review><gmapID>0x80e91478e6839771:0x1c3c9f8fa2819a41< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Their prices just went up again, so its a good $20 bucks for just a normal trim with tip.  But when you live downtown and need a cut every couple of months, its the usual spot.  Be sure to call before hand and put in your name to gauge the wait time, then you can manage your window shopping on State Street and Blender's fruit smoothie shop next door. When its summer tourist season there may be a long wait, this is not a locals only joint.<//Review>

i got my hair cut from this place. i walked in and a mid-aged, fairly stocky/overweight mexican lady is the one who attended to my hair cut. don't get your haircut from her. i am a male with straight blond short hair. i told her to make it just short enough to spike a little bit. the normal male hair cut. to do a 2 on the sides and a 3 on the top and if it still needed to be cut from there, so be it.  she completely screwed it up. some areas were longer than others and it didn't look good at all. i don't know how you can screw up with just using the buzzer. it was $15 dollars. I went in a couple days later and told them the situation. I had to pay again. Never going here again.< /text>

I went this week for a haircut & specifically told the bleached blonde that I wanted my bangs to be straight across and cut to BELOW my eyebrows. When I opened my eyes after she had trimmed them I found them to be crooked, above my eyebrows and LAYERED. Also, she wouldn't trim the sides of my bangs although I asked her to because she felt that I should grow that part out. NEVER again, my hair looks terrible! Good thing that hair grows quickly and the bangs will be better in a few weeks. Bad thing is that I feel like I look stupid for the next 2-3 weeks while the bangs get enough length to not stick straight up like alfalfa! Avoid her if you want something specific, she will do what she wants, it is totally not okay. Also, this is not Jason posting, it's his wife, can't remember my password!</text>

<review>At first the front desk was just down right rude, I couldn’t come unless I had a mask on . Home Depot gives masks to their customers. While a place that deals in I’ll people who ill doesn’t.   The  actual medical practitioners there are knowledge and give good service. I would recommend this place for what they  know not for customer service .<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Waiting period was a bit long, but I understand because it is during a pandemic. Although a suggestion I would make is to have the patient be called once they check in inside when they are ready to be seen by a doctor. I went to the reception desk once I arrived and then left to wait in the car. I kept having to go back from time to time to check whether or not I could go inside for my appointment. Secondly, there should be someone that cleans the door handles and anything anyone touches as soon as it is touched,, especially during the pandemic, to provide the extra care for the patient. Finally, the communications here is a major fail. My pharmacy never received the order for my prescription that was to be changed in time. I had to call them twice in order for this to happen. As far as being seen by the doctor, very great job! Overall, good place to be seen for something that is not super urgent, but expect some delay in trying to obtain medication on time because the communication aspect of this place is not great.</Review>

If I can give 0 STAR, I WOULD GIVE ! THE WORST SERVICE EVER. DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. They charged 225$ for a COVID Test, and they lied to me as a veteran that if I pay them with my own money there will be reimbursement from the VA hospital , but when I call them back for the reimbursement they start saying different thing. SUPER BAD on they end up giving no help or instruction and LIED to their customers . Good luck on somewhere else .<//text>

The Xpress Urgent Care is absolutely a fastest place that provides Covid-19 test. I was in and out in 10 minutes.  They're very organized and well-controlled environment. The process from making online appointment to the actual test is very simple and straightforward.  All the staff are very professional, helpful, and friendly. Last but not least, the turn around time is very on time. Thank you Xpress Urgent Care for your services.<//Review>

<text>Staff was nice. If you pre-filled your information online and just check in, you’ll be able to get tested really quick. Everyone had a mask on from start to finish and social distancing is strictly enforced. I felt pretty safe there. Process was seamless and my results came back in 2 days. Overall it was great.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>It's quick and very convenient. My insurance is BCBS so they didn't charge any co-pay (not sure, you need to ask). Website said naval test takes 2-5 days for result. I got mine in 1 day. BUT you need to know a bit about registration online - answering questions  and click [next] etc... During pandemic, you should know how. My family doctor requested my exam on Zoom even. So good luck. I am very impressed with speedy results!</review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<text>The process is so seamless! Book your appointment online and input insurance information and they will bill your insurance directly so no other payment is needed (or if you don’t input insurance then you can select debit/credit card-I didn’t use it myself so I’m not sure if you pay online or in person) and then show up to your appointment 10 minutes ahead of time and check-in inside. I needed to get tested and was able to book a rapid test. I was notified via text when my appointment was confirmed- they also texted me hours in advance that they could see me earlier than my scheduled appointment time and that worked out perfectly for me. The two people who worked there were so nice and professional- they were quick and efficient about the entire process. I was able to get my tests results in about 20 minutes. I would highly recommend this place if you need to get tested. Thank you for all of your help!!< /text>< pics>

The front desk staff that arrived late also was not aware of all of the services this clinic provided. Was quoted two different prices on that particular service as well. Still waiting for my results on Monday evening when I was told I would have my results email over the weekend.</Review>< Pics>

I went in for a rapid Covid 19 test for peace of mind for my family. The website was easy to navigate my appointment schedule and when I went in they only saw one patient at a time which made me feel safe. It was clean, quick, and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend this place for sure!<//text>

<text>Needed to get a COVID test due to being exposed at my workplace. Xpress Urgent Care is super close to my house so I thought why not. I made an appointment the night before and I was scheduled to come in the next day. I arrived, parked right in front and was in and out within less than 5 minutes. No wait, and I was tended to right away. I came in and they confirmed my appointment and gave me a nasal swab and I was good to go. I honestly couldn’t have had a better experience at a medical facility. This place has the ideal customer service in medical care, something very rare to find these days. I was referred here by a friend who works in a clinic, and I will be referring others here. Thanks guys!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>They were very clean, organized and efficient. I didn’t have to wait long to be seen. They limited one patient at a time to enter the lobby. They notified me of results as soon as they came in and advised me on steps to take from that point. I would recommend this Urgent Care.< /review>< Pictures>

Made an online appointment. Uploaded insurance and ID online. Arrived to location, no lines, no wait. One person in office at a time. Filled out a form. Took the test, pain free. Office was clean and neat. Was asked to wait in car after 20 minutes come back for test results. Great experience will be back when needed. Thanks!</review>

Great customer service! Especially being a covid test center. They monitor people in and out of office very well so there is plenty of social distancing. Very quick and efficient</Review>

I came to this urgent care for the first time to get a COVID-19 test. All documents were signed online before I came. When I got there, the lobby was clean, empty, and fast to complete. The urgent care took measures to ensure physical distancing and minimal contact. I sat in my car until they were ready, and there was standing, no touch thermometer that took my temperature.

The front desk staff was friendly. The MA or nurse who took the sample wasn’t as friendly, and seemed annoyed. I wasn’t bothered too much, since it was a quick test.<//review>

<review>I went here for a covid test. It was fast and easy. The usual intake paperwork for new patients was all done online so no need to fill it all out there. The facility was clean with proper covid protections. The staff was nice and no pointless waiting. They did their thing and bam out the door in 10 min. If you need covid testing rapid or pcr I recommend this place.</review><Date>1617912648644< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Xpress Urgent Care and the team are excellent! They are very professional and keep everything clean and friendly to Covid testing, only letting one person in at a time. Moving efficiently to the next person. It has been a really stress free experience. I highly recommend them.</Review>

Very professional, very quick. I was there for COVID testing and was expecting to have to wait. I got right in at my appointment time and was done within 5 minutes. They only allow one person in at a time, and all looks very clean and sanitized. Highly recommend.</text>

When patients arrive they wait outside and only one patient is allowed in the building at a time. I felt very safe. The office was clean and well run. Staff was courteous and respectful. Great experience I highly recommend Xpress Urgent Care.< /Text>

<Time>1597642696157<//Time><Review>NOTE: THIS IS REFERRING AN ANTIGEN RAPID TEST PROCESS I WENT THROUGH.

Website was an easy process to get an appointment and fill out registration. My appointment was at 2:33. Directions said to go 10 minutes early. I arrive 10 minutes early and went inside to the lobby. Clean and modern. Looks new. I waited in line for about 10 minutes just for the front person to tell me to wait in the car. I wasn't parked directly in front so I informed her where I parked. Then waited in the car for another 25 minutes. I finally got a call asking for my symptoms. Then 2 minutes later another call saying they don't know where I parked. The assistant finally came to the car had me fill out a form. Then 5 minutes after that the person taking the test came out to the car. She wasn't pleasant, and almost seemed irritated. I didn't receive instructions and she was upset that I started to remove my mask (thought that they were going to put something down my throat), so she was even more irritated. But just then told me to leave my mask on, tilt my head back and without any warning put the swab in my nose. Swabbed around for about 3 seconds or so then  told me to move my car to front of shop. She wasn't particularly friendly, just all business I guess. Informed me it would take about 20-25 minutes for the result.

I moved my car to front of clinic and proceeded to wait about 12 minutes and got a result brought to my car. Overall it was easy. I think if they informed people to wait on the car, gave us a little bit of expectations, and stuck to the times of the appointment it would be better.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Went here for a Covid rapid and PCR tests. I woke up coughing on a Sunday and they had appointments available that morning. Everything is easily booked online and you do all the paperwork online too. They only allow one person in the lobby at a time and the place looked really clean. Once I was checked in for my rapid test I got a brief call (at my exact appointment time!) asking about symptoms, any medications I’m on, and allergies. They came out a few minutes later wearing a face mask, face shield and gloves and did the swab. I then waited 20 minutes went inside and got a paper with my test results on it. Whole thing took less than 40 minutes.

They could not do the PCR test same day because insurance wouldn’t cover it so they said to come back the next day. I again easily booked the appointment and filled out the paperwork online. Next day I showed up 15 minutes early. Two minutes later they were at my car and did the nose swab. They told me to make a lab corps account and that test results would be available there within 3 days. The test was on Monday at 11:30 and results were in on Wednesday at 12:08am.

I was very happy with everything.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

When I first went to Xpress Urgent Care for my COVID-19 test, I quickly did my registration and the forms online and received my testing right away. From my experience, the testing part was really quick and easy. The people working there were very nice and understanding of my situation and wanted the best care for me. Overall a good experience and would recommend!< /text>

At my first visit when I first got at them and I ask them I needed a covid 19 test the Xpress Urgent Care clinic was more then glad to help me out and I ask them I needed to see if I could make an appointment they got back at me within the first hour, and told me I had an appointment that same day at 3:10pm when I there I was in & out within 10 min.s . The staff were nice and professional and the lobby was clean and cool.  I would recommend this Xpress urgent care office very helpful to anybody looking for or in need of any kind of quick helpful Urgent Care, I give the lady at the front desk a two thumbs up.  Thank You ...< /text>

Was tested for COVID-19. The process of taking an exam was really quick and results came in 2 days as expect. Staff was friendly. Would be fully satisfied, but...
When I called to ask about test price I was told that it will cost $115, but when I came next day I was charged for $225. I can't recommend Xpress Urgent Care because of this lie</Review>

<text>Safe and fast experience for covid testing ! The appointment system is a brilliant idea 💡. It Keeps everyone safe , doesn’t put you at risk of exposure since no one is allowed inside except for the actual patient ! It’s definitely NOT like other urgent cares, where you have to stand in crazy lines to see if you can get tested and it’s not even guaranteed. I totally recommend this Urgent Care .< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I needed a COVID test in order to travel out of the country. Xpress Urgent Care offered this type of testing. I was able to get right in, have my test and receive the results within a couple of days. The office was clean and the staff was great. Everything went through very smoothly. Overall great experience.<//Review>

The team at Xpress Urgent Care in Tustin did an excellent job taking care of me and my employees when we needed it the most! They were fast to acknowledge our situation and flexible to meet our urgent need for testing. The process was very smooth and handled very professionally by the entire team.<//Text>

I wanted a 15 minute covid test and while it was difficult to get an appointment (keep checking back for a time), once I was booked the service was fast and efficient.

I have used Xpress twice before and will definitely use them again if the need arises.</Review>

I needed to be seen urgently, but did not want to go to my usual clinic due to it always being so crowded. I went online and scheduled a same day appointment. The online registration and check in process was super easy and fast. When I arrived I was greeted by the friendly receptionist and taken to a room. Within minutes the Doctor came in. Total visit was about 10-15 minutes total. My medication got called in for me which saved me time.  I definitely recommend this Urgent Care location for prompt and friendly service.< /text>

I was originally supposed to have an appointment at the Stanton location at 5:05pm. There were plenty of appointments available. I drove 45 minutes to this location. I had received several texts from this location asking me if I was on my way, and to make sure I came before 5pm. I was racing to get there in time. I got there at 4:55pm. As I walked in, the receptionist rudely stated "sorry, the physician went home, you will need to reschedule." I was very frustrated with the fact that they did not call me or wait until 5pm as they had requested. The receptionist told me to go to the Huntington Beach location, which was another 10 minutes away.

I drove to the location and went to the urgent care. The receptionist took me in right away and did everything needed. The Huntington Beach location is the only reason why I gave this 2 stars instead of none.

Overall, disappointed with the customer care at the Stanton location and would NOT recommend that location. The Huntington Beach location was much better and more organized.< /text>

I need a clearance from having the Covid-19 virus so my company sent me to Express urgent Care to get another test. The nurses there answered all my questions thoroughly and I got my results the very next day. I was able to return to work soon afterwards.  I would like to thank the whole staff for being so patient and understanding.</review>

<Review>Went for a rapid covid test and was told they took my insurance, when I got there they said it was only if I got the 3 day results test. $50 for the test was okay, but the $175 in office/administration fees was a bit much. Staff was nice and took all the safety precautions. Results took almost 30min instead of the advertised 15min.</Review>< Pictures>

I needed to get a Covid test. I made a same day appointment and was seen at exactly my appointment time.  The website said I'd get results in 2-3 days, but after having the swab done, I was told to come back in 20 minutes and they'd have my results.  They did.  They were very efficient & organized and managed all the patients well.< /text>

RUN!!!!!!!!!
go elsewhere...........
The amount they  charged me was ridiculous.
The first appt. was fine.........:
I had to go back to finish it and get the paperwork from the doctor.
They told me to comeback in 2 days in the evening .
I get there and the doctor was not at the clinic.
The nurse asked me to comeback the following day.
The next day the doctor realized that the nurse that gave me some shots had forgotten one and had to give me the shot that day.

I was told to comeback on that Friday which I did.
I was told by the nurse that the doctor was not in and that I had to make an appt through the website to see him.
I get doctors have a busy schedule but my time is important too!!!!
I was informed that my grandfather and grandmother
Had dementia and there was no one else that could take care of them so I was with them 24/7 until they recently passed.
I went to the clinic today by appt. and was trying to get the paperwork going again .  Doctor was in but the nurse said he couldn’t do it today......... mind you
When you make the appt online it asks you what the appt is for specifically. No one bothered to call or text me to let me know that it wouldnt be done today, the day of the appt.
The nurse asked to comeback tomorrow (here we go again went through my head )
I asked them for the forms that showed what had been done and decided to go elsewhere.
Didn’t want to give this place another penny.
The nurses aren’t the nicest either
There was only one front office person that was very nice and helpful. The rest of the nurses make you feel like your an inconvenience to them.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I was visiting CA from out of state and made appointment same day. My personal experience with the staff was professional and kind. My experience starting with covid procedures in place , phone call upon arrival and waiting in designated outside area until your are addressed by a professional. Only 1 person In the lobby at a time. Mask required. I do want to commend the staff on their professionalism towards patients,  this specific day I witnessed the doctors and staff be verbally abused by a patient, racial slurs etc and although faced with undue treatment from this patient they remained calm ... professional directive and firm in there standing in procedures.  I commend all the medical personnel in all they provide during this time.< /text>

The staff at Xpress were very polite and very prompt. I  kinda wish the instructions for waiting in your car were posted outside so I didn’t have to clog up their phones and call but otherwise the whole process for car Covid-testing was very straightforward. They might have updated their process since I went in June so check beforehand.

I tried to upload my insurance and ID before the appointment but it didn’t load. Hopefully they were able to streamline that, too.< /Text>

I wish could give them zero star, their front desk "Fernando" (I'm not sure if it is her real name, she didn't have a badge and this what she said when I asked her name) was the rudest girl that I've ever seen. She literally refused to give me service. I asked her if she can give me the cost for the test that my doctor ordered, she said I can't give you estimate because you are not our patient! I said how can I become your patient to get the estimate and she said I'm busy and I can't put your name to our system to give you cost of the tests! Hopefully the management read my review .< /Text>

Easy appointment process online. Better to do it on your phone though. Check in is easy as long as there aren’t many people also trying to check in. They come to your car as you wait.<//review>

On site COVID test as required by my work. They were professional, quick and well prepared.  As an essential worker, I am confident in the results. Since I am required to take this test regularly, I feel I can trust Xpress Urgent Care to do it right.<//text>

<Review>I had a Covid scare the other day.  I went to the store and they wouldn't let me in because their temporal thermometer said I had a fever.   We immediately set up an appointment with Xpress and I was seen less than two hours later.  They did not test, but assured me I was fine. Everyone was so friendly and supportive.  Thank you.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The actual covid test went fast, but waiting in line outside the building in the hot sun when you don’t feel well was terrible and having to wait outside for your results too. Total took about 2 hours, I thought this would be faster but just as long as drive thru covid tests. If they utilized the waiting patient rooms it would go so much faster.<//Review>< Pics>

Easy online registration and when we arrived at the facility, we were seen immediately and had the test taken promptly.  got the results in 20 minutes as promised.  This Xpress Urgent Care in Stanton should be the model for others.  My experience at the Xpress Urgent Care in Tustin was worse adn took over an hour.< /Text>

<review>I came here to take a rapid covid test a few weeks ago. The facility was clean. I had an appointment, and the process was smooth and easy. I waited in my car for my results, and within 20 minutes, I had the results. Staff was friendly. I would definitely come here again in the future if I need another covid test.< /review>< Date>

<Review>I want to extend a huge thank you to Stephanie at the Xpress Urgent Care facility, 12860 Beach Blvd, Stanton, CA, for graciously helping me on Wednesday, 8/17/20. I went to the facility thinking I had made an appointment, but my name was not on their schedule. Somehow I had messed up scheduling the appointment. Graciously, Stephanie was kind enough to assist me, a 79 year old senior and retired US Army Veteran, instead of turning me away. Many Thanks, TMP, Captain, US Army Medical Service Corps, Retired.</Review>< pics>

Making and appointment online was a bit of a hassle, but persistence and patience is key.. They have a system going on upon arriving to the appointment which is great and safe. All in all, it was a good 1st impression. 2-3 day for results if you're going for Covid testing. Don't account for weekends.. Unless it only includes weekends with holidays.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I made an appointment on line for a COVID test and was quickly checked in and asked to wait in my car. The technician came out promptly and swabbed be in the car through the window. The whole thing took less than 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend Xpress Urgent Care. By the way I was negative!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Anyways, the whole process was super easy, fast and most of safe! Only one person was allowed inside the lobby while the rest is required to wait outside. Once it is your turn, you head inside and let them know your reason for coming. Then they proceed with what you need to do - in my case it was a covid testing. The results came in quick and was emailed to me within 3 days! Overall Urgent Care made it quick and easy to get covid testing done!<//review>< user_id>

Reliable, safe, and simple - all things you want for a stressful thing as getting COVID-19 testing. I was able to schedule a test the same day I was worried I had symptoms. Definitely complete the forms online prior to going there and it didn't take me more than 10 minutes to be tested and got my results withint 48 hours. Strongly recommend.</text>

I already came here 2 times for the covid tests (nasal swab). It took around 15 mins for everything to be done. Then just 2-3 days for covid test result. It’s easy to book schedule online before coming. Staffs are nice and helpful.<//Text>

I got tested on a Monday and my results back on Wednesday afternoon:) It was a quick and easy process, the front desk girl was very helpful and the one that did my nose swab was too. It was not painful at all and the whole process took less than 5 minutes!</Review>

<Date>1597611891541<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>My family made 4 appointments to get the Covid test done at the Stanton location.  It was a little bit hard to make appointments for all four people at the same time, but I managed to get us all in.  On the day of the tests, we were instructed to wait in our car and someone will come out to do our swabbing.  It was very easy, quick, and painless.  It really shocked me that my 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son didn’t even cry nor they were scared.  The PA (Tram Anh) was very professional and gentle.  The test results came back quicker than promised, only 3 days to my email.
I would recommend this place to my family and friends.  And I definitely would come back here again if I need any urgent care.< /Text>< pics>

I went to Xpress Urgent Care after I had been sick and coughing so hard that it hurt to breath. The doctor was quick, efficient and gave me the things that I needed to kick the upper respiratory crud that I had. The doctor was nice, listened to me and tried to make me feel at ease because I came in looking absolutely pitiful.

My only warning with their office is their payment system. You are REQUIRED to pay the co-pay upfront and I was told that they could not bill it. Further, I was told that after I paid the co-pay and was seen, I would be responsible to pay for anything that the doctor does during my visit. Again, I would have to pay upfront at the end of my visit and they would not bill me. Thankfully, I was only responsible for the co-pay. Just be warned that if you go to this facility, you may be asked to pay more than just the regular co-pay fee and they will not bill you for it.< /review>

I had a last minute COVID19 test done A day before leaving for my trip. My appointment was at 7:45pm but the urgent care texted me hours before letting me know that I could come in sooner since there was availability around 7pm. So I went in before 7pm, nurse came to my car, explained the procedure, swabbed my nose and I was on my way within 10min! I was told that I would receive my results in 4 - 7 days. I actually received my results in 3 days. I appreciated that Xpress Urgent Care notified me of early openings and that they were quick and thorough with the testing.<//review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I needed a covid swab after a confirmed work related exposure. I was able to schedule a same day rapid antigen covid swab. There was still a good 15 minute wait outside even with the appointment which was a little disappointing. I had to wait outside in a line in order to check in for the swab. After checking in, I was told to wait in my car (another good 10minutes) before a PA came to swab me. After the swab, I needed to wait another 20 minutes for my results to process before I had to wait in line outside again just to go back into the building to pick up my results. I would say I spent nearly an hour. So if youre going to do this, keep that in mind. Good thing is that you will get your results the same day if you opt for the rapid antigen covid swab.
They will do a self temperature check during your check in. Hand sanitizing stations are set up. PA who swabbed me was friendly. No other complaints except the long wait.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

They were absolutely rude not accommodating at all never even tried to contact me when it came to my results for my test advertised one price For three days the test and then after I took the test informed me that they are booked for weeks forcing me to pay some thing that I didn’t agree to and never even called me with my results I had to call multiple times never ever go here. Basically could’ve had it and got over it by the time I got back to me don’t waste your money< /text>

< Review>
I had my covid test on October 12th.  I was told I would receive my results within 2 to 3 days(via email I provided them).  Called Xpress urgent care last Wednesday, was told they don't have the results, that they were sent to my employer.  We'll see.</Review>

<text>Awful experience. Front desk lacks common courtesy and the employees are unprofessional!! I did a covid test and the worker who took the swap did it the wrong  way. I never received my test results so i had to call them 4 times and each time i was placed on hold and never got back to. I had to drive back to their location to get my test result. In general, if you are looking for a professional team who knows what they are doing, this is not the place to go to!!! its a waste of money and time!!< /text><Response>None</Response>< Date>

I had a rapid antigen test for COVID done here and everything was seamless -- I was able to easily schedule the appointment online, took the test while I was in the car, and received results within 15 minutes. Super nice staff!</Review>

the lousy service, the secretaries or nursing assistants, are abusive pedants, with a discriminatory attitude.  It is persistent service, I do not recommend it to anyone.  better advice find a better place with professional staff

I recommend another laboratory in this they are very incompetent, they do not respect an appointment, they are rude and with a bad attitude, look for a good place, for their laboratories, except here lousy service< /Text>

Safety procedures were followed. Was very easy to make an appointment. It was not clear which type of covid test we should sign up for. And when we got there the various consent forms were not helpful either. The staff explaining the consent forms was rude. You could tell they were tired and probably overworked...at least thats my guess for the way we were treated.</review>

got my first Covid-19 test before travelling for work from Xpress Urgent Care.  I did all the paperwork online despite never having been there, drove up, got swabbed, and drove away.  I hope the quick check in and on time appointment is a new normal.</Review>

<text>I was exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19, and I had my COVID-19 test taken here, and opted for the rapid testing, with results within 30 minutes due to my need to return to my family. You need to at least have 4-5 days from exposure to test time.

So my review is only in relation to the COVID-19 rapid testing. The process is quick, the staff is friendly and courteous.

You MUST set an appointment online.

Check in at your appointment time, you will need your ID. You will fill out some quick forms, provide your phone number, then pay. You will then return to your car and await their phone call. It's best to move and park upfront so they can better locate you, they will be swabbing your nasal cavity in your car.

Afterwards, it takes about 30 minutes and they will come out to your car to deliver your results.

Good luck!<//text>< resp>

<review>got an allergic reaction my face was red and swollen I ran to this urgent care because it’s down the street from where I live. The receptionist was very friendly she answered all my questions and got me in right away. The provider explained everything to me. I was given a medical injection and was told to lay down for a few minutes. The young lady from the front desk gave me the injection. I didn’t feel a thing she was very gentle. I was in and out of the clinic in less than 30 mins. Excellent customer service! Great Staff! I’m glad I decided to go to this clinic and not another one. Doctor faxed my prescription right away to my nearest pharmacy. Thank you Xpress Urgent Care.<//review>< Pics>

Best urgent care experience I can recall. They are working around the clock to accommodate recent demand in COVID-19 testing, and Jahiro from Xpress Urgent Care, as well as the rest of the staff from the Stanton location, fit me into their busy schedule. Was in & out with results in under half an hour. Thank you!!</Text>

Dont bother coming here. They do not care to help you get the care or help you need.
My experience at Stanton was quick; however, their administration or those who handle billing are simply unhelpful in so many ways. Both my insurance and the clinic are making it very difficult for patients to be seen. I was told by my insurance that I do not need referral for an urgent care visit, which I never ever need a referral for any of my urgent care visits before. So I asked Xpress to call my insurance for confirmation, but they would not and my insurance would not call Xpress as well. They only make it difficult on us (THE PATIENTS). So if I have COVID and cannot get tested because of that then I will not only possibly be dead but also spreading to others.
Wow what a way to help the community. Not to mentioned that, the appointment only become available the day before, and they told me I cannot be seen if I dont get my referral 3-4 hours before my schedule time. What can I do when I am just simply a patient having no control over any of their demanding.

Another experience at Tustin, long wait time even with an appointment. But that is understandable since they are seeing a lot of patients.

PS: not everyone is like that and I do appreciated all health care workers for putting their life on the line but maybe also consider helping us out when we are in no power to do anything about it. You can just give my insurance a call and problem solved.<//text>

TERRBILE EXPERIENCE. We had probably the worst experience at healthcare facility with this Urgent Care office. My mother fractured 1 of her fingers from a door slamming into it. We came to the office by their recommendation so they could take some xrays. The PA confirmed the fracture and suggested we see an ortho within a week, and we should pick up her xrays in a few days. We scheduled an ortho visit a week after, and we came back to the urgent care office to get the xrays. After waiting for almost 25 minutes, the receptionist, who had a scowl on her face the entire time, gave us a piece of paper that says the radiologist confirms the fracture. We needed the actual XRAY SCANS for the ortho to look at, NOT a radiology report. We asked the receptionist for the scans and waited another 15 minutes, only for someone to tell us that they do not have the physical scans, and the "xray guy" just left the building. We had the ortho appointment in 30 minutes, and at this point I was furious. After an intense argument with a PA or nurse (i'm not sure), they finally gave me a LINK to the digital xray scans. Why did they not give us this in the first place?? Why did I need to argue loudly with a nurse to get our xray scans (that we paid out of pocket for as well)??
Fast forward a month (July 22) , my mother decided to go to another ortho office, and we tried accessing the LINK given by Xpress urgent care, but it has EXPIRED 4 days after it was given to me. Once again, we went to the office to get the link and waited for 30 minutes, only to hear that no one there could provide the link again and the "xray guy" is out of the building... AGAIN. They said they would try to contact the main office in Tustin to figure this out. 15 minutes later, we would told there was NOTHING they could do. NOTHING. They told us to go on to our ortho appointment and they'll send the link when they figure it out. We honestly lost all hope at this point and left with no xray scans for our ortho. He was not happy because he needed the records to see how my mother's finger has healed. We finally received that link 3 hours later. At which point, we already finished the visit with our ortho. I normally never write reviews, let alone bad reviews. But our experience with this office was so incredibly stressful, dissapointing and frustrating that I had to.<//Text>

This place was a lifesaver. The professionals who were there the Sunday morning I came in do not know how much I appreciate them! I was in and out and provided the best care possible. They even offered a steroid shot to get me through a wedding I had to attend that evening in which assisted with my extreme pain level from a horrible sinus infection. This place is clean and new and I would recommend to anyone in the area.<//review>

BEWARE- Westminister location (now closed) was unable to draw blood after 2 visits. Given a phone number at their Huntington Beach location since no one could reach a supervisor. Accounting department was contacted FOUR times, always to voicemail.  To this day I haven't received a return call nor refund. Poor service bordering on fraud.</Text>

I recommend this place, they are very fast in handling cases. Sometimes they have a doctor and sometimes physician assistant, but they will help in diagnosing your problem and give you medication until you can see your primary physician</Review>

Awful experience my husband went to get a civid 19 test and they took for ever to get back to us and every time we called, no answer and the voice mail was always full. No matter what time we called always busy. On top of all we find out that other paces places were charging $119 for the test here they charge $200, and it’s it’s not worth it at all,  waist your money.<//Review>

<Text>Me and my 2 baby girls got sick after Christmas before New Years. Their dr and mine were both closed for the holidays. New Year’s Day I decided we need to get in to see someone and urgent cares were closed or extremely busy. Found Xpress and because they were still new they weren’t busy so we figured why not try them out. I’m glad we did because it was quick and easy, except for filling out paperwork for 3 of us. Lol. I would definitely go back. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. My girls are 1 and 2 so that age is not easy when they are sick. The dr was awesome with them and understanding with all of us in one room.< /Text><Date>1581372400949</Date>< user_id>

They have the ruddest and most unprofessional nurse of any urgent care .no matter how sick you are ,that nurse will diagnose a cold even with a fever of 102 and diarrhea, you will end up in the emergency room . I would avoid them at all cost.  I am 70 years old and the young punk nurse blew me away .< /text>
