<review>Went here to get some bagels.  Overall they seem to follow the Covid measures and it was clean location.  The server at the register seemed pretty confused,  I ordered for bagel with hummus and they didn’t know much about different veggie options available there.  I took my takeout order and as I was about to eat I noticed the hummus was missing.  So I went back to the store and asked, the person at the register said we don’t have hummus.  I wish they can be pretty more active while taking the orders and save the hassle for customer to go back to the store.<//review>< gmapID>

I got a BLT this morning. I specified clearly that “no bacon” and 1 egg. Gave me a BLT with bacon. Called up to ask about this. The lady put me on hold twice.
So rude and ruthless staff including the manager. Please save your money and stay away from this Noah’s Bagel.< /text>

Good, it's not in Willow Glenn so there is none of that snobbery you find over there. Decent, fast service. It caters to the tech industry serfs, and they don't make lattes, that's why there's a Starbucks next door. Nice bagels and the flavored cream cheese is good too.< /Review>

Nothing against this store, but I suggest going instead to the larger Noah’s Bagels across from Westgate Mall/Target about 2 miles away. The manager at that other location is really good, often on-site, and the higher quality is obvious. (August 2020)</text>

<text>Being from New York, bagels are something i'm always skeptical of outside that area of the country. We got breakfast sandwiches from here and they were delicious. The bagels were unique and flavorful while the rest of ingredients were fresh and complimenting. The decor of the place is cool too, looking like the subway. Highly recommend for all your bagel needs.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>The bagles are great with many variety of choices. But more than the food, the service there is one if a kind. I have been there in Tuesday after noon and the two gentlemen there helped me so much! If the owner of this review reads this I want him to know that his employees are the best!!!</review>< Pics>

The only one I did not like was blueberry, but everyone else in the office seemed to vacuum up as soon as I sat them and the Double-Whipped Shmear down.

<text>It's your average bagel shop - not bad but not impressive either. It is good for a quick lunch if you need to run to a meeting, however, by lunch time a lot of their bagels are sold out. Go early if you want a wide selection!

On a side note, their spreads are awesome! The almond spread is great with sweet or fruit bagels and the garden veggies spread is great with everything else.<//text>< Pictures>

They have Ruben on rye on the menu. Then the male at the cash register says they do not have rye bread, and have not for weeks. They also do not know when they will be getting more. He offered Ruben on a bagel.... Okay, so I ask, Can I get a discount of you're going to serve me a Ruben on a bagel, because I feel like it would be degrading to the Ruben to do so.  A skinny man who took charge of the conversation, who I assume was acting manager...Said sorry no. The manufacturer is not sending us rye so we can't do that....  bad customer severe. One star for competency. If you can't serve it take it off the menu.
I have worked customer service for a number of years. This is not how you grow a brand. I do not come to Noah's often. And it will be very unlikely that I will choose to do so again. I left hungry and disappointed. I most likely will not come back, and if asked about this chain I  will tell this story. I will stick to a real deli for my meal thanks.</text>

Fast service, bagel was soft, and the flavor was great! It was our first time here and the staff was willing to walk us through a couple menu options. The coffee I chose (the Chelsea) was very flavorful, but lukewarm in temperature<//Text>

Usually eat @ this location once a month to  order the breakfast sandwiches. We tried most of them but our favorite is the 2 scrambled eggs, sausage and cheddar on a cheesy bacon bagel It's so delicious!!

The service is quick and the staff are friendly.< /Review>

The biggest reason I gave gave this 5 star review is because of Hayley the cashier. The food is good, love the Nova lox, but Hayley is genuinely sweet and happy to help every time I come in. Even if the food is only ok, a great customer service experience makes all the difference in the world.

She is patient with me while I wrangle my toddler to order food. She smiles at  everyone. She never seems to be in a rush to get you through the line, but she is not slow either. Thanks Hayley for being so sweet!< /review>

I love the people working there. I love their coffee. They are always freshly brewed at any time of the day and their bagels are great. Thanks to all of them working hard in that store.  Keep up the good work. :)

Ordered a Turkey club on a wheat bagel because they were out of my first 2 choices. Staff was not very friendly or helpful. Waited 15 min (there was no one in front of me) for an incorrect order. Missing the bacon and the tomato spread. The fresh tomato was so unripe it was white in the center, there was a pathetically small smear of avocado, and the deli meat was nothing special. Disappointed and will not return.</review>

I'd really love to give them five stars but they always run out of coffee. What a great problem to have. Customers love your coffee. Why is Chelsea always in the smallest container?! Sometimes you are in and out and others it could be a 15min wait. Over the years I have seen an increase in customer service, much more friendly. My other issue is the bathroom, always dirty. Get rid of the clutter/cabinet, clean, paint, recaulk..</Text>

I walked out of the place as I couldn't believe how filthy everything was. Floors/Windows/bathroom all looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a long time. Bagels might be great, but I could only imagine how dirty it was behind the counter and in the kitchen and left before buying.</review>

< Review>
I went to the Noah's Bagel by Oakridge Mall and had the most amazing service and bagel yesterday so decided to go again today only went to one closer to my home. So disappointed. Will never come here again. Ricardo the person who helped me was very rude, when I asked a question he simply ignored me and repeated what he said even louder with disgust on his face. The wait time for my sandwich was about 15 minutes although there was only one person in front of me, everyone else already seated I guess. There was only one girl making sandwiches and three young men doing nothing but entertaining themselves. My sandwich was made incorrectly twice and had maybe a tablespoon of shmear total. If you want a good bagel and great service, go to the other Noah's!< /Review>

< Review>
I don't know why I keep coming back here.  Service is terrible and the bagels taste like garbage.   Most of the time I can only eat so much of it before giving it up.   Most likely won't be coming back here, the only times I did was because it is right next to the Starbucks I normally go to in the mornings.< /Review>

I've gone to Dr. Hamilton and Shayna for over 10 years now. I even bring my 8 year old son to them! Now that's trust! Their facilities are clean, office staff is friendly and helpful, and they never oversell you on anything! They are my one stop for dermatological /cosmetic needs.  Thank you Dr. Hamilton and Shayna for the warm touch, making me look my best NATURALLY!< /review>

Doctor Hamilton displayed vast knowledge of his profession.

My only wish is that the Beverly Hills office would offer the patient facials at least weekly. The service is provided in the Woodland Hills office only.

The staff appears to be informative, friendly, and professional.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

He is the one the FDA goes to for product study and he is the first to have access to the important findings.  He is actually wanted all over the world but he loves his practice.  I hope he stays in practice for years to come, a true gem. He is passionate about what he does and loves to share the research with you.  Want to know what product ingredients really work?  They are listed on his web site.  I would not let anyone touch my face with a filler but him, especially lips, he repairs all the messes other doctors make because of their  lack of skill and a greed for money.

Best dermatology services! I got taking care of my wart. It was completely gone after 3 shots treatment. Also I was dealing with extremely dry and irritated face skin. Shanah was very helpful. She have recommended me few facial products and gave me other practical tips. My skin have normalized within a month and I can't be more happier!< /Review>

Two times the doctor was out for a vacation for  more than  2 weeks without giving any  appropriate alternative to the doctor except an assistant! Which if the doctor failed I don't see how the assistant gonna be able to accomplish to give the right treatment
Plus the stuff are pretty much don't care ! If you read this pls do yourself a fav and keep googling for 5 more minutes and find someone that actually will be worth your time and money!

He just happen to find a suspicious mole on my back, and performed the biopsy. Turns out it was a malignant Melonoma. He removed and and got it all! He and his staff are amazing.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1452613787769< /Date><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c29c2112845ca9:0x1a9fa903e81a19e3< /gmap_id><Name>Bob Anderson</Name></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Hamilton did an amazing job with my little nose problem. I used to look so awkward trying to cover it up in broad daylight but now my nose looks normal. Thanks Dr. Hamilton.</text>

I always believed that a plastic surgeon must be sensitive towards the insecurities of their patients. He is definitely a must when it comes to these sorts of things.</text>

Pizza is awesome. The lemon pepper wings are better than wing stop. The meatball sub tastes amazing.< /text>

Small greek salad was enough for both my husband and I to have some-- very impressed with the quality and size.  Ravioli was amazing, as was the pizza.  Fast delivery!!  Thanks, Mike.< /Review>

< Review>
I found this place just by driving around and the 🍕 is the best. I chatted with the owner and they have some history in the area and the building.  When I walked in it was like walking into cozy, comfortable and unique place. I felt at home when I had dinner at the restaurant.  They have what I think is a very very very giant pizza perfect for parties.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>They often deliver when no one else does, I know I made an order on Christmas Eve and they were still open. It takes a pretty long time for the pizza to be delivered no matter when you order it, up to an hour and a half. I do think that the pizza is pretty good, but the ranch is super tasty. So if you are a pizza dipper like me, then this may be the place for you! Just don't order for delivery if you are in a huge hurry.

Edit* to five stars. They have really sped up their delivery time. Nowadays it doesn't take them an hour to deliver and the pizza is great, so I'm bumping it up to five stars!<//review>< Pictures>

Very good pizza, has a lot of cheese however so if you are not into super cheesy pizza’s then ask it with light cheese.

Had the Mexican Pizza and a good old pepperoni pie. I will definitely be going back.</Review>

Great pizza and friendly service!
My only complaint is how small it is, other than that Mike's awesome.

Keep in mind that their Works pizza comes with jalapeños and pineapples. I personally love it, but that may not be for everyone.</Text>

I'm from the  New York, new Jersey area.  This pizza sucks. Definitely not east coast style pizza. If you're from the east coast and want real pizza.... Search else were.  Way to much cheese, no garlic, salt, pepper, or anything to add to it</Review>

Door was locked and a guy came out and said they'd open in 30 more minutes. So I went elsewhere. Poor 1st impression.< /Text>< Rate>

<rate>5</rate><review>Phill's Drills was held at this park. Today.. Lots of space for.the kids to run around in and do some great exercise with Coach Phill. He is so awesome for trainings for either adults or kids. Highly recommend him. Look him.up on IG. He is based out of Carson. The park was very clean and great playground too.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVXWylqCxMCp1FcV3bm5qsRYLSI-3R6e-ScQ6H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5Wj4UAhObTV_OIE32a6e0Rt021kOy9CVwi2aD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0EPFc0bWxMZQhGziypcn5kFBVzZVxtgpvicCL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd352f85832a2d:0x851edfa69c4ad067</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Alfonso is the man! He towed our broken down Camper from Idyllwild to Phoenix on very short notice. He sent pictures to us from pickup to delivery and made the process very easy and pain free. We would recommend Alfonso to all our friends in a second. Very personal service from beginning to end! He saved the day... and change a stressful situation into a nice interaction.
Thanks so Much Alfonso!!!! A Job well done!!<//Text>

I just used Alfonso Towing to move my 1974 VW on a flat bed truck from Palm Springs to get it serviced at a shop in Yucca Valley.   They had a vacant slot so collected it 30 minutes after I called.  The driver (Luis) was very friendly and efficient.  Charged $150 which i think is pretty reasonable.   Very satisfied.<//text>

When my roadside service towing company left me waiting over 1.5hours, canceled with them. Googled nearby tow companies and Alfonso towing popped up. Called and they arrived within the time limit stated. Luis was very pleasant and efficient! We went from Whitewater to Cathedral City, price was very reasonable. Would definitely recommend! Ask for Luis!< /text>

I called Alfonso after another tow truck driver showed up and started demanding way more money then he'd quoted.  Alfonso offered me a flat rate that was even cheaper than the other guy's original quote.  Luis and Alfonso showed up very quickly.  So fast, actually, that they beat me getting back to the car.  When I arrived I was so happy to find that they had already solved the problem, and were just waiting to greet me.  It was obviously a difficult task but they made short work of it, and they did not charge me any more than they'd quoted (even though both of them came just to get it done!)  I'm so happy that I ended up finding them, and I highly recommend Alfonso to anyone who needs a tow!< /Review>

I called to see about buying a vehicle they told me to show up at 230. I called at 2 to let them know I was on my way. I drove 30 miles to come see this truck they had for sale. I get there and the gate is locked. No big deal so I call to let them know I am there. I get told that no one is there and I have to wait at least an hour and a half to see the vehicle. Vehicle wasn't what they had described and had a bunch more miles than conveyed. They said there was no issues but when I finally get to drive the car the transmission is slipping like crazy. Worst experience of my life trying to buy a car and I have had some bad experiences. After all is said and done my car bottomed out on the road out and I was backed into by someone who lived down the same road. I don't recommend using this company ever.<//review>

0 stars!!!!Called to get a tow for my RV from one location to another. I spoke with Alfonso and he gave me a price of $350 flat from one location to the other with no additional rate. Once we got to our destination his worker told him he was going to charge us an additional $190 for the hour he spent taking the hitch off his truck and wouldn't leave until he got the money! My husband called Alfonso to settle the matter by saying we were not told there was additional payment for them to hook up and unhook the RV. Alfonso the owner then proceeded to cuss out my husband over the phone! Very rude very disrespectful and very unprofessional. I would not use this service again. They are not honest about their prices.< /text>

<text>Called and they quoted me $70 from DHS to PD. Never said cash or Credit price difference. And once I got to the destination and gave them my credit card the drive said our machine is 'broken'. And the 'owner' (over the phone) said bank of America sent us a new machine. And I fought it saying yeah no, you never said that, and eventually their machine 'started' working. And then they go on and say it's  $70 for cash and $80 for credit card. Never told me that over the phone. And I was charged from Clover not Bank of the America. Yeah okay...< /text>< Pics>

They are very knowledgeable about the beers and their flavors and how to pair them with food. Make sure you tell Dave my beer guy hello. They also have other other liquor and wine.

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Stopped by for something to eat.  While the snack selection left a lot to be desired, the gent that was on duty was more than pleasant enough to make up for it.  Surprising, actually, since I'm fairly certain most liquor stores include "Brusque?" as an application question in the hiring process.

The place always smells of weed, because the cashier guy with a beard is always in the back getting high. I went there the other day and had to call the guy over from the back because he was out back smoking with his friends . cash only because the card reader doesn't work. And the prices aren't that great. I won't be going back.< /review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>The customer service at this location can not get any better, I had my vehicle painted here and they made sure it was flawless when I picked it up.  Anything you want fixed or improved they never question, this is the type of service that is missing in other collision shops.   I would highly recommend this place and never go anywhere else.  Ask for Kevin if you have any issues he is the best customer service General Manager in the business.< /text>< rating>

I was visiting the area and needed help with a minor scrape in a tight time frame..  Jesse provided exceptional assistance in getting the damage repaired and getting me on my way.  If I lived in this area, I'd come back to this body shop in a heart beat the next time I needed their services.  Top marks for professionalism, customer service, and compassion.  This is a great auto body shop!!<//text>

The best thing that can be said about a business is that they back up their work and that's exactly what they did here.  I had a tough repair and they fixed it to my satisfaction, and they repaired the alarm system and gave me a new battery.  Joe was in touch all the time and so was the manager< /text>

<date>1515561271624<//date><review>I think this Caliber Collision should have 5 stars.  I've never written a Yelp review before.  I had to write one for this shop because the service I got from Joe was just incredible.  Not only was my car perfect after their work, but Joe kept me informed on a daily basis and delivered a day early. And the HUGE plus was that the car was delivered to me cleaner inside and out than it had been since the day I drove it off the new car lot 12 years ago. And thank you Margaret for your always friendly, helpful replies to all of my questions.  Thank you! Mary Robinson< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Name>Carrie McClish<//Name><review>This is one of my happy places based solely on my love of sweet potato pie. I realize that love of sweet potato pie is a very selective thing. Some folks like their pie with nuts or made with lots of butter or sugar or both or maybe neither. I come here because the sweet potato pie is closest to the way my mom made her sweet potato pie. And since my mom is now in heaven I get another happy memory of my mom in every slice of sweet potato pie I purchase here. For the record there are other marvelous looking offerings as well - pecan pie, cakes and even peach cobbler and - but none interest me as much as the sweet potato pie.</review>< GmapID>

I bought the lemon tart. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. The amount of lemon flavor was just right. Also, the whipped cream topping added an extra something that I wasn't expecting. Definitely will visit here again.< /review>

Had to get me a slice of pound cake for my diet cheat. I didn't want to bake a whole cake but this is the place to please your palate when you want to please your southern sweet tooth, especially if you're cheating on your diet. Do it right and make it worth that pound.</review>

<review>Went for a walk on one of the worst weeks of my life in a city I know nothing about. On the hunt for a book store and came across “Its all good Bakery” imagine my surprise “it’s all good” when it felt like absolutely nothing was. (my infant son is currently being treated at UCSF and it’s been rough) I was met with a pair of kind eyes 👀 peeking over a mask 😷 and I walked in to see. Is it all good? I was met with beautiful cakes and pies and sweets that would fill up the emptiness building inside of me for the last week! I ordered a slice of coconut cake and a sweet potato pie.
They were delicious and I highly recommend stopping by to cure your sweet tooth 🦷
Cause at the end of the day we’re alive and for the moment It’s all good!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Googled, called the evening before still has voicemail greeting from Thanksgiving. Website states hours are 8:00am to 7:00pm, closed Monday December 14th reopening Tuesday December 15th, great friends birthday is 15th! We live in Vallejo. Up early there by 9:30, deem lights, looks closed, but I see employee(female) inside. No sign on doors or windows stating Closed. New business hours posted due to pandemic (same on VM greeting) before I could get out man walks up pulls door, locked. Man waves to employee nothing, man waits nothing, he knocks on door again , waits, a few minutes later male employee opens door they have a conversation man walks off. I yell from car (parked right in front) are you open? No, we will open Thursday.  I don't know what to tell you to do if you live out of town and want to go 😕.</Review>

Good bakery, but they often run out of items during the holidays. I would think they would prepare more of the popular items to ensure shortages don't occur. I continue to support them because their bakery items are delicious and it's a Black owned business!!👍🏾<//review>

<user>108721012908510707798< /user><review>I start to crave certain desserts and flavors at different times of year. Luckily, It’s All Good, is nearby. I missed eating a slice of Peach cobbler during the Summer and Thanksgiving because no one made or brought one. German chocolate cake is the staple dessert during my family’s Christmas holiday parties and birthdays, I could not locate even a slice until today. Now I know for parties in 2020 it is best to pre-order. I am so happy there was an abundance of peach cobbler and slices of German chocolate cake.<//review>< date>

I heard so many good things about this bakery over the years. However my experience was a terrible one. My friend went on and on about the wonderful deserts here so I couldn’t wait to finally try them. We went on a Saturday afternoon about an hour before closing so that may be why they had such a limited number of options. He loves their German chocolate cake but since  allergic to coconut I would never attempt to try it. The customer service was horrible. The young lady who helped us was clearly unhappy to be there and even less happy to help people. Not only was she far from friendly but she put my banana pudding in a paper bag with no lid which I clearly saw they had so when I tried it once I came home it was a mess. I also ordered a slice of red velvet cake which was dry and tasted like box cake. I would never recommend this place and have no desire to return. 😞<//review>

Amazing tasting food with pictures of Black Panthers all over one of the walls. Really a reminder of the history of the area and the soul of resistance against being stamped out. Gone a few times with friends, always enjoyed it. They did pump up the prices a bit but you’re supporting a local business so hey why not drop an extra few bucks?< /Text>< Pics>

The Sweet Potato Pie Cake does not taste like Sweet Potato at all.  It taste like white cake with cream cheese frosting.  Buyer beware.  Go in and test your cake before you buy.  There are better Sweet Potato Pie Cakes out there.

This is not accurate:  Sweet Potato Pie Cake—Sweet Moist cake that "tastes just like Sweet Potato Pie" with cream cheese cake.  You can’t find this signature cake anywhere.  Often imitated but never duplicated.< /Review>

<rate>3</rate><text>The desserts are awesome and always were when I lived here many years ago. They are really the very best. I was in the bay area this weekend for a funeral. I was ranting and raving over It's all good bakery in my home town in Texas for many years. I really wanted a slice of coconut pineapple cake. They had whole cakes and would not sell me a slice of cake. I was really disappointed in them. I explained to the owner why I was in town and how I loved her cakes. Well I'm flying back to Texas tomorrow and will never get the experience of eating that fabulous coconut pineapple cake again. Even if I come back to visit. I think that was very poor customer service. The rest of the cake would have been sold if they had sliced it. Because, It's all good! It really is! God bess y'all.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

After catching a UC Berkeley basketball game ... I was just driving by and decided to stop in this wonderful place... I ordered a sweet potato pie... and after meeting the owner "T" she was so kind that she gave me a sample of a sweet potato cake .....probably the best piece of cake I've had in my life.....⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❤🏀</Review>

The sweet potato pies are real good but a little doughy. The peanut butter cookies Simply Delicious. The oatmeal raisin cookies I have to try again the first time I had them they were delicious but this last time not so good. During the holiday season you can't get those meal cookies 😁.< /Text>

The sweet potato pie was prize-winning, and unusual taste that I didn't recognize it was wonderful and again was outstanding. With whipped  cream and a little ice cream both the peach cobbler and sweet potato pie won the day.< /review>< pics>

Wonderful sweet potato pies and yellow cake with chocolate icing.  Delicous, light and moist.  Go early in the day, otherwise you might be disappointed because they are sold out.  I went at 2:00 pm and they were sold out of two cakes that interested me.  Luckily, I  got the last two sweet potato pies with the only remaining yellow cake.</text>

<review>We ordered a red velvet cake on short notice for my wife's birthday. Not only was it ready for pickup earlier than they said it would be, but I'm not a big cake eater, but I must admit that I put a hurting on this one. Moist, days later, and delicious. Didn't get the picture fast enough sorry.</review><Date>1530422656557<//Date>< userid>

Highly overpriced for the size of the cake ($6.75 + 1.00 for plastic container) and the condition of the facility which was pretty messy. Customer service was slacking as well. It's all good though. It's important to support our culturally based local businesses as much as possible but this was a bit much!<//Text>

<text>The cakes are good. Customer service over the phone was terrible today. The person who answered the phone hung up  before I could ask a second question. I had to call back more than once. I called for the hours on New Year's Eve and then again to ask about the availability of one of their cakes. She hung up on me both times after giving one word answers..<//text><date>1451581937440</date>< resp>

No way. I worked on the property next door for two days. All these people did was glare at me. I'm a huge fan of baked goods. They didn't say hello, encourage me to come in, or at the very least smile. There are posters of Black Panther party history all over one wall so you can get a heaping spoon of racial politics while you get your baked goods.<//text>

The pizza is delicious. Everything I've tried has tasted great. The potatoes go well with the pizza and the cinnamon square things and the cookie are so good. The staff is friendly. The price is a little high but it is so good so if you're willing to pay the full price or if a local organization is doing a fundraiser with them, get their food. Definitely.<//review>

<review>We love to try different pizza from different places other than the ordinary ones  (Dom, PH, Papa). We decided to give this place a shot. The pizza was delicious!!! Perfectly cooked!!! The service/attitude of the employees could have been better....that's the only reason why they didn't get that last star.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>I'm not a fan of pizza at all. But I came here to catch the game with some friends. It was nice and cozy inside with a lot of local baseball and basketball decor.
My friends ordered pizza and some wings and pitchers of beer.
So I'm writing this review for the California pizza I had. ADDICTED. I loved it!! I'm kind of a health nut so avocado is my favorite. On a cheat day this will be my pizza go-to.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THE
CALIFORNIA PIZZA.
It was soft, not a thin crust but not super deep dish styled either. It was just perfect.

One thing, if you sit on the inside of the table away from where you order you can't get out unless everyone else gets up. I wanted water but I was trapped! At least my friends were nice enough to grab me a cup. The fountain is accessible for refills (I think...)</text><gmapID>0x80dd2aaf7329c653:0xf8d6db6121604f9a< /gmapID>< name>

Ordered pizza and salad which was more than enough to satisfy my wife, son and I. I would say food and service was above average on a Thursday at lunch which is slow. Over ten  TV's so you probably won't miss your sport. My kind of pizza joint for sure.<//Review>

<Date>1474474714533<//Date><rate>4<//rate><Text>We order for delivery here maybe once a month or so. We have tried a few different pizzas, wings, sandwiches, and the Pepz nachos (which are potatoes and very very delicious). I haven't had anything I didn't like. The people answering the phone/taking orders have always been friendly, which now I expect, however the first few times I ordered, I was caught off guard by the friendly staff; friendly phone order staff is just not typical when ordering pizza.
We've been ordering from here for about a year and a half. This is our go to pizza place!
I wish they would put notes in the system for how to find my condo as the complex itself is complicated with a lot of buildings. I wish the drivers would put in notes on customers files to find repeat customers easily considering they do have me on file already.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd2aaf7329c653:0xf8d6db6121604f9a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is my favorite place to buy pizza hanfs down!! Their crust is full and thick and theirbtoppings are premium. Their is a price tag that comes with this greatness as well but its reasonable when u realize how good the food it.

The only reason why i dont give this place a full 5 stars is because the actual sit down expirence is underwhelming. When you walk inside it just look like you want to stay there. Half of the arcade games for kids dont work and sone of there specials just are not worth it.

Overall the food is great but dont eat there take it home.<//text>

Good local yogurt shop better than most in the area. Flavors are ok but not really developed. A bit more intensity and they would have something. Like this it is a fine afternoon stop, definitively not a destination.< /text>

Very friendly service, but prices have gone up ($3.75 for a cone now).  Their original fro-yo has a good balance of tartness/sweetness - quite refreshing.  If I want cheaper or more flavors, I'd drive to Yogurtland.  If I want richer/creamier, it's Flavor Brigade's frozen custard, without a doubt.  But if I'm lazy and don't want to drive an extra 5-10 minutes to either location, I'd drop by Blush.</Review>

<Text>This is a great little yogurt place located inside a shopping center. Their blush flavored frozen yogurt is amazing. The decor is simple and modern which I like. However, parking there isn't the easiest because it's also surrounded by Pete's Coffee, Safeway, and several restaurants. There is an underground parking a little past the store which is where I like to park in the summer so my car doesn't sit in the sun.<//Text>< Resp>

I love their original. It's perfectly balanced between tangy and sweet, it tastes like yogurt rather than a yogurt-like food product, and it feels good to eat.<//Text>

Really enjoy their "blush" and "original" flavor yogurts--tangy, smooth, flavorful. Cute interior. I like that they have mochi balls/chunks as a topping. I usually get the parfait and I'm pretty full afterwards.<//Text>

Overall, Blush Organic Frozen Yogurt does have solid flavors but between the poor experience, limited service, and average textures, I'll opt for one of the other ice cream shops in the city.</review>

I would have had a great experience if the store shelves would have cat food  on them. No merchandise very limited to the expensive ones. Fancy feast no selection.</Text>

Lots of inventory! Fun experience just to walk around here.
They have a great cat rescue with multiple kitties to choose from!

The Doggie Day Care did not appear to be reopened yet but I could be wrong. Call first if you want to bring your dog to the doggie day care.

Nice employees. Lines got a little long when the store got suddenly crowed but it wasnt too bad.</Review>

<text>I brought my adopted dog Siscily, her owner passed away,  to be groomed at PetSmart. Her body needed to be shaved because of the matt's. Her facial hair was fine and I combed it every day and used barrett's, hair ties and bobby pins to add some style. When I went to pick her up I saw her on the table, but thought to myself that can't be my dog. The body was shaved, but there were random long pieces on still left on parts of her body and her face had been unevenly cut. She is a Cocker Spaniel Mix, ( Cockapoo ), but not anymore. She looks like a Poodle and then I I saw on her profile, that I created my groomer, ( Araceli ) , changed her breed to Poodle Miniature can you believe that, but I changed it back. There will be no more styling the front bangs for now and I AM SAD ! I will say the store manager was very kind to me when I went back to addresses my concerns and even gave Siscily a Dog Sweater at no charge and refunded the the $82.00 that I paid and for what I am not sure because no report card was given 😣<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIGFMbp-wURWyNvJ9pvASlXareAUh2JIn_hQxi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_HjVsMkAz44wcviL2-CQOCI-Tf22CF4H5BEcK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPv8VWIf8kt14wUx1FCLLPgqpYBBedyG1H-JQs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2dc9de6f9179d:0x36aa1bab1ee9df1b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Petsmart on Huntington Dr in Pasadena is located in a Mall. Plenty of parking and easy access. This place is larger than most I've visited in the past.  They have a grooming area, a small pet clinic and adoption station as well as everything else you'd expect. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. This was the neatest, best stocked and cleanest store I've ever seen.  Well done to the management and the team.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Super clean store with friendly employees! I was able to pick-up my cat's sensitive stomach food in store. Very satisfied with their selection of cat food; however, they didn't have any birds or rodents in-stock. Really wanted a hamster, maybe next time!</review>

Here's an idea petsmart, stock your shelves before you open so you stop wasting customers time and gas money. I'll take my $70 a month elsewhere I'm not coming back here.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Good to see what you want. Kinda pricey. If youre a new pet owner they have all the answers. If you know what youre doing and dont need help make sure to shop around for pricing.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

They won’t pricematch chewy, yet the Hawthorne, Compton, Long Beach locations and even el segundo and Torrance, Costa Mesa, Irvine, seal beach and Santa Ana have all price matched me in the last year this location claims to not price match.</Text>

<text>Manager in this store assisted me quickly and honestly. He was very helpful even when he was busy doing work related stuff. It was very nice to have gotten help from someone like that. I will definitely comeback here again and again.</text>< time>

We love the Pasadena Petsmart. And during this trying time, they are doing on-line ordering and curb-side pick-up, and they are doing a great job with it!< /Text>

Tanks full of dead fish and employees roll their eyes when you point this out. I thought it was due to the lockdown, but they informed me they never closed, so they just come to work and allow their fush to remain in tanks sharing water with other tanks. Go to a real pet store, not a capitalist money grab. This is Pasadena. There are independent fish, bird, and feed stores EVERYWHERE! Resist corporate takeovers of our lives.< /text>

Very low stock. Often they are out of what I need. Prices on website are lower than in store. They should order and ship for free to your home like other stores do if they are going to continue to keep their stock low. Also prices are high compared to Amazon or target. Personnel is nice and store is clean.< /Review>

<text>This store is always clean and usually well stocked.
Just an FYI:
Currently, Purina/ Friskies canned cat food batch #s 1157, 1159, 1161 are very possibly tainted. Many cats have come up sick and or dead because of that food.
Be warned!</text>< Rate>

We come in regularly for a "Paw-D-Cure" (nail grind, teeth brushing & ear cleaning) and we (me and both dogs) love the grooming staff.  Although one of us doesn't like getting her toenails done.  :-)</text>

<review>The older white haired associate(I regret not remembering his name) was AMAZING! He was very informative in regards to grain free dog food and ingredients and made sure we got a food that perfectly fit our pups needs. This led us to purchase a new brand - the pet smart brand! Our pit bull LOVES it. Not only are we now saving money and getting our girl the nutrients she needs, but our pup is acting like this is her fav food! A big thank you to the associate that helped us. Truly a great asset to your team.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I wouldn’t even put one star after what happen to my dog at the groomers on 1/11/20... My experience with PetSmart grooming was the worst... the older man who was supposed to cut my dogs nails was very untrained. He had my dog up on the table with the leash to high and to tight.... when I went to go tell the groomers that it was to tight someone rushed in and unhooked her by that time she had passed out and when I told them what happen to my dog they wouldn’t tell me what happen they just took her to Bandfield and I waited 10min until they took her out and the excuse they gave me that her heart is week and that’s why she passed out.... weird thing that’s her doctor who I’ve been taking her to for the past 10yr and he’s never told me her heart was week...</Text>

<Review>I used to like this place until what I experienced today. I work literally across the street and came in wearing my uniform after work. Nothing unusual there, that's a part of my normal routine. I was in the area where the guinea pigs are kept (makes sense since I have one and I got her from this location!) and went to the bedding. I was comparing the prices of bedding when I noticed a store associate come towards me. He was squinting at me mad hard. I used to work retail, I KNOW the drill. He did the usual polite question of asking if I needed help. I kindly responded that I was fine and was just browsing. I went back to what I was doing. About 5 or 10 minutes later, HE CAME BACK. Same thing. He would squint really hard at ne, stare at my cart as if he was checking to see what I was putting in it. This continued the whole time I was there and I'm disappointed beyond belief.

The whole ordeal was uncomfortable and unnecessary. Who would shoplift and steal, while wearing their WORK UNIFORM!?

Do better, PetSmart.

For fellow shoppers, avoid this location. They have an issue with profiling. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>The store is so organized that it's easy to find what you're looking for. And if you can't find it, there's staff around to help you. Staff has been friendly & so helpful. And if you come in with your dog, you might end up buying more than you intended to! Lol<//review>< response>

<text>Terrible customer service. Came in on a Sunday afternoon looking to buy a starter fish kit and some fish. After waiting for help for about 10 minutes I went up to the front and requested help. The cashier told me to go back to fish dept. and someone would come help me. Even though I saw the cashier call for an associate over the PA no one ever came.

Headed back to cashier, repeated process. No one came.  By this point there were several families waiting for help with fish. After about 10 minutes a young lady finally showed up but instead of asking around she helped the first person in her line of sight. At this point (I had been there about 45 min) I got in my car and headed to Petco in La Cañada. The store is smaller and they don't have as much variety but, as soon as I came in, the store manager asked if I needed help and then spent about 30 min explaining the different types of fish and procedures necessary to start a new tank.

This was all probably for the best.<//text>< Pictures>

This is a very large and well-equipped pet store almost a super store where you can find virtually anything including animal companionship. The staff i dealt with were very nice, friendly and knowledgeable. They also have a pet clinic on the premises as well as pet grooming, and dog boarding. Plenty of parking in the large parking lot that serves other super stores.</Review>

<text>Great location and staff.  Stay away from the Moneovia pet hotel.  Day care staff is the best!  Jasmine and Terrence are always a pleasure.   The dog trainer is great, huge shout out to Armando!

Weekends are an event because of the adoption charities that come in.  Not unshoppable though and if you're looking to adopt a cat or dog, come here first.</text>< pics>

Walked by the doggy day camp area with my dog, and the lady behind the glass started yelling at me because one of the dogs inside started barking.
Seeing how they treated that dog I wouldn't dare leave mine< /review>

It's so much easier to order online and then pick up in store. No walking through the store and standing in line.</text>

Used to be a 4 star review but updating today.  I just experienced one of the most outrageous examples of unprofessional behavior by a "manager" of a retail store.   I went into Petsmart today to buy crickets.  When I walked in the person who stands there greeting people said hello and if I needed anything.  I was talking to someone on the phone and I indicated I was OK. at that moment.  Eventually I would need crickets but I had other shopping to do first.   When I returned to the area where the Crickets were I stood there for quite some time. Other people were also walking up and down the aisles looking for assistance and one person had to go up to the registers to get someone to come back and help him near the turtle supplies.  I stood there for over 10 minutes and not one person showed up or check the area at all. I was not the only person waiting for assistance.

I got disgusted and decided to leave the store.  I have been shopping at this store for years.  As I was leaving the "manager" who I didn't know was the manager was near the entrance with other employees and I overheard him giving some direction to the employees.  I commented to him as I walked by without stopping, "maybe you should have someone come back and check on people standing around for over 10 minutes waiting to buy crickets"

I was walking at a brisk pace because now I had to drive another 7 miles to find somewhere that would be able to sell me crickets.   The manager came literally running out of the store to argue with me stating that "we tried to help you and when you came in you said you didn't need help".   I then told him that I didn't need help as I was walking through the doors and that doesn't excuse standing in a location for 10 minutes and being ignored.  For clarity I talk loudly as a baseline.  I am a veteran, and I have a fairly significant hearing loss so I tend to talk loud.  As I'm walking to my car this "manager" "Juan" continues to argue with me telling me that I'm yelling.  Which is irrelevant because I can yell all I want.  I'm outside walking to my car. There are no laws stating I can't yell.  I then turned around to him and stated that he hasn't heard me yell and than put on foghorn blast to make a point.   I was born and raised in New Jersey and worked with Adolescents for nearly 15 years.  I can be loud if necessary.

"Juan" continues to follow me to my car, literally trying to antagonize me and when I gave him a demonstration of yelling to provide clarity that my normal tone of voice is far from yelling he then starts telling me that he is calling the police and follows me to my car and starts taking pictures of my license plate.   I told him he can call anyone he wants.  There are no laws on the books that say I can't yell at "Juan".  This is part of the California entitled snowflake mentality.   Someone needs to put his big boy pants on and grow up.  I actually hope that he did call the police because his actions to which I have a witness were clearly intentional and  antagonistic. For him to follow me out of the store trying to create a conflict is outrageous.

As long as Petsmart employes him I will no longer be a customer. There are too many other places where I can shop to put up with childish unprofessional antics of a bruised ego of an incompetent manager.   In fact when I called the store from the parking lot before I left asking for the name of the manager it wasn't him at all.  He is not the manager.  He is the assistant manager.  I will absolutely be taking this to their corporate office on Monday.   I've dealt with a lot of nonsense from insurance companies and other organizations that think they have you over the barrel  I have never been confronted with a "manager" who conducted himself in such an unprofessional manner.

Juan is going to learn a lesson about conducting himself appropriately because I am going to make sure that this is broadcast from end of the planet to another.< /Text>

PetSmart is merchandizing Friskies canned cat food in a most inconvenient manner now.  Instead of offering sealed cases, well-organized, they now haphazardly stuff the shelves with open cases, and the sealed cases are off in a corner with zero organization - everything stacked every which-way.  It is now quite difficult to select specific cases of cat food.  This brand only - the other brands remain well-merchandized and organized.  I would use the online-order with store-pickup service but, for the Pasadena store at least, getting the order right is challenging and after trying this with them a half-dozen times, I have given up and decided to come in to the store to make my selections and then check out the normal way.</Review>

<text>I love this location and the staff is always friendly. We started going to PetSmart when we got our first dog. Angela is one of the best trainers we've worked with over the years. She taught our stubborn French Bulldog to listen and learn skills in a positive, safe and fun environment.  We did every training level with Angela. When we got our second Frenchy four years later, we brought him to be trained with Angela as well.  We plan to complete all training levels with our second dog.  We've gone in from time to time to get food or more toys and the staff always remembers our dogs names.  I don't know what we would have done without Angela over the years!

<Review>I saw an employee WALKING after a loose dog that was running through the busy parking lot. This employee was so unmotivated to catch this dog it was gross. The employee was holding the dogs leash and attached collar, and the dogs owner was crying at the front entrance as she watches her dog almost be hit by two different cars.

I felt compelled to tell the employee that he will never catch the dog if he doesn't walk over to it. Luckily another customer was willing to go after the dog since this employee couldn't be bothered.

<review>Staff is friendly. Store is well stocked and maintained.  Used the groomers for the first time. Maybe it was because it was a weekend, but it took longer than it should have. 3 1/2 hours for the basic grooming service, no extras.<//review>< Name>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>I had taken a video of the dog daycare to show a friend who is looking for a place to take her dog a few days a week. Here is a conversation that happened as I put my phone away.

Dog daycare employee:
“Excuse me mam, we don’t mind you snapping a few photos but these are people’s pets.”

Me:
“Ok, they are animals its not human trafficking. Lets not get into a freak out.”

Btw-
Petsmart dog daycare is an entire wall that is a window so customers can look at the dogs. I’ll bet when the dog owner drops them off they are aware that dog privacy is not a part of the service.
Dogs pee, poop and sniff each other’s butts in public. I’m sure they will be fine if they get their picture taken.<//Text>< Pics>

PetSmart hosts dog and cat adoptions on the weekend.  This Friday was also a pet adoption day.  There were a host of cats and dogs from puppies and kittens to older dogs and cats.  Donations were as little as $150 for adoption.<//Text>

<Text>I would put ZERO starts if I could.   My husband was falsely accused of stealing something today.  My husband attempted to return something (with a receipt) and the Manager accused him of either being an idiot (because my husband didn't notice the item was missing from the closed box) or of stealing because the manager found it unbelievable that somebody, including his staff, would miss that the box was empty.    We have been customers there for years (as should have been evident by looking at our purchasing history - which the manager claimed to have looked up).  This type of treatment is unacceptable.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
You don't want to go to this petsmart .... You will be falsely accused of stealing and the worst of all you will not get an apology.  You'll just get is the employees being defensive and making you look like you committed a crime.  I do have witness's... I've already called petsmart three times to file a complaint and I still haven't been called back... I told the manager if I don't get a public apology I'm going to sue and he said you can't do that.  My friends .. You can sue for falsely being accused of stealing.  Petco has been around a lot longer and I will make sure I go to Petco again .  If you look into Facebook page... I'm actually not the only one falsely accused.. There is another customer that has been falsely accused.  I dare you to put down something you don't want after all.... the employees will assume you took it.< /Review>

If you go to all the trouble of dressing up your dog, going to the store and waiting in line for a picture with Santa, stand there until you receive the emailed photo because ours never came and they don't resend them.  Bah humbug.</Text>
