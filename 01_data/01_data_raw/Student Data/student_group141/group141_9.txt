< review>
Came in wanting to switch first of all manager was extremely nice asked what service we needed and told us an estimate time on how long was the wait so we went to Starbucks next door came back and it still wasn’t our turn which is understandable it was extremely busy so if you’re thinking of stopping by plan to be in there for some time . The girl who helped us out was really nice gave us an amazing deal on the iPhones that me and my husband wanted offered us a case and screen protector at first I told her no because they are super pricey !! But then she told us the benefits on why we should get them there , her and her co worker with long hair even showed us how well the life proof cases are ! The environment in the store is amazing seems like everyone there is enjoying their job there and not like those other stores u go to where the workers just don’t even care about ur questions . The amazing part is that she helped us set up our T-Mobile account most workers just tell you to do it yourself , thank you Kimberly you were so helpful !!< /review>

Amazing customer service! I was helped by Carlos and William. They were amazing, I recently switch to Tmobile. They explained the plans and the promotions. Tmobile should be happy they have people like them working for them. Store manager should be proud as well!<//review>

Called ahead of time to make sure the phone I want to purchase was in stock. The associate named "David" reassured me they do indeed have it in stock. Came in prepared to purchase phone, but when they brought the phone out, it was a totally different model phone!!! Wasted my time, my gas, with no apology. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL AS WELL AS UNAPOLOGETIC!!!! #TMOBILE YOU NEED TO RETRAIN YOUR ASSOCIATES!!!
You'd think it would be easy to check if there's a certain phone in stock! But no, they are too busy chit chatting how they have it the worst, working on July 4th.

Great customer service Maribel and Jesse went above and beyond with getting me the phone that I wanted; which is the 64gb iPhone in rose gold, they didn't have it in stock at their store so Maribel located it for me at an east la store and Jesse went out of his way on his time to pick it up and have it ready for me the next day! Thank you so much guys! 😁😁<//Review>

<review>I purchased two IPhones the rep put my cellphones under someone else's name instead of mine. I provided my driver's license and i verified my full information with someone over the phone. Now, I have no service because I'm under investigation with T-Mobile department for 2 IPhones. I have a sheriff report looking at me as a criminal. I did everything accordingly to the law. Please do not go there they steal people's identity and you get stuck with charges without using them.<//review><response>None</response>< Name>

< review>
If I could give this location no stars I would. They have very bad customer service instead of helping out with my  issue they just told me to call customer service. I asked simple questions about my bill which the representative didn't want to look back at the memos to help me with my questions. I think they are very lazy. The only time the representatives want to help some one out is when they are selling u a phone other than that they really dont care< /review>

<review>My rating is based on my experience with Alex, i've been going to this tmobile for about a year now and i prefer if Alex helps me out because i've gotten all my family members' phones from him, he does things quickly and gives you the necessary info you need to make a good purchase and has always addressed any of my questions or concerns readily. the store is a few blocks from my house so it's super convenient for me!<//review>< pictures>

<Name>Nancy Macario< /Name><Review>They are usually helpful but I went in and this time I got Alex. He was unhelpful. For an issue I had on my phone he said "you have to call it in. We don't do that." When I mentioned they have done the warrentee exchange before at the store he told me NO. I asked if he was tired he said "no, I'm just bord."
Then I asked is this job borning? (As a joke)
He said "yes, sometimes".
Wow! This was such bad experience and I was trying to be nice and this dude was just so negative and unhelpful! And my sister was so excited to get a new phone! And we wanted to kill 2 birds with one stone but this Alex guy he was so negative and really rude! We just went to another store where they were so helpful and just did the warrentee exchange on the spot!</Review>< Date>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Not a star deserves this store, they are despots, rude, poorly ordered and they never help you, nor do they mess with your account. I recommend you go better to the one on Pacific Street, there if they serve you with desire, with courtesy and kindness

(Original)
Ni una estrella se merece está tienda, son unos déspotas, grosero, mal encargados y nunca te ayudan, ni a tu cuenta se meten. Les recomiendo vallan mejor al que está en calle Pacific, ahí si te atienden con ganas, con cortesía y amabilidad</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Great park! Beautiful grass. Dog fun zone is bark dust but larger than Crystal Cove and Heritage Park dog areas.
Lovely area with picnic tables and a playground.
Individual outdoor restroom stalls with outdoor hand washing station with soap and paper towels.
Not very busy on weekdays usually, as you can see from the photos.
Plenty of free street parking.<//Review>

Very nice park but it is full of kids at the playground. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a quiet walk.</text>

My first walk through it resulted in a walk through dog poo as the grass was do high I couldn't see it.  I later watched a mid 70s gentleman with three small dogs park, walk the dogs around and not pick up after them.  Some people don't get it.</Text>< pics>

We went to the park to use the enclosed dog park. It's a great facility to play catch(sic) with you're furry friend. There are several water bowls and water stations at the enclosure and doggie bags. The #1 reason for the 2 Stars is that it is mostly dirt or powdered wood chips (70%), as they have not replenished or refreshed the wood chips in quite some time. There is never anybody else using the dog park, probably due to the dirt. If you dont mind having to give your dog a bath afterwards its 5 Stars.<//Text>

Nice playground, restrooms, and picnic tables up top.  Large slightly sloping green space and the dog park at the bottom of the park.</review>

< Review>
Sea canyon is never crowded love it for my kids and there's a big grass area if you need it, dog park at the other end, plenty of parking on the streets, public bathrooms, I like coming here when my kids want to use bikes or skateboards, sidewalk goes around in a circle. ^-^< /Review>

I asked to sit outside but it was cold and changed my mind. The host accommodated my request with no problem, greatly appreciated it.</review>< Pictures>

Saturday visit for dinner, their vents must have been down because the place was smoky, my eyes were tearing. The food was still good, although I feel sanitation and cross contamination training needs to be reviewed.</text>

<text>The food is fairly diverse but often times not quite Spanish. Some dishes are better than other but overall just okay. A lot of the food was overly salty in my opinion. I wish it were more Spanish (charcuterie) and removed items like fried chicken or burgers in place of more traditional tapas.</text></record>

Phlight had a great atmosphere and the food was delicious! Nice place to have a light dinner and a glass of wine with friends or significant other.  I recommend the Bacon wrapped dates (amazing!) and the cheese platter. I also had a phlight of wine. They give you 3 to 6 3oz servings. Great way to try out the different wines they serve. Oh, let me not forget, the Pork Belly tacos.... wow! Must try!<//Text>

One of my favorite local restaurants. They're tapas style food and have something for everyone. The drinks are equally as outstanding. The only thing wrong with this place is that it's always full, so we have to order pick up.< /Text>

Always a come back for me...I'm no expert on Spanish food but I like the flavors of all the different foods I've had here... I Very nice restaurant service is excellent (very attentive) all dish orders are delicious- small portions so you can order a variety of tasty plates and not feel to full for the next one
My favorite is the lamb sliders ❤</Text>

I loved it. The food was delicious, full of flavor! We got the pork belly taco, chile relleno (not like your traditional Mexican style that is fried with breading but still tasty with that walnut cream sauce), paella and asparagus. I loved it all and can't wait to go back and try more of their items because it was seriously a struggle to decide what to order since everything on the menu sounded so good.</text>

Really delicious food and a lot to choose from. My girlfriend and I had trouble picking items to eat because everything sounded amazing but I will say that everything we ended up ordering was amazing. The staff was very friendly. I will be coming back here</review>

First time here...went for a retirement celebration lunch.  OMG!  This place is great!  All small portions...tapas! Everything that was served was really  delicious. Try the taco with pickles-surprising and delicious.  Or the warm kale salad-if kale was served like this every where I would be eating a LOT more kale.  The wine list has some wonderful items...try the Alberino!< /review>

Great place, great food, and a nice atmosphere. It's been years since I've been to a good tapas bar and phlight was a great place to go to after such a long hiatus. The bacon wrapped dates are a must, the elote was delicious, and the pork belly tacos were very tasty. We went with friends so we all picked off each other's dishes.</review>

Best tapas in the Whittier area.  Always busy that’s a clue.  Food to share, great variety and super nice people.   We’ve been eating here for years and recommend it highly.   It’s not super authentic Spanish style it’s more nouveau and we prefer this California feel.  Great wine list too.<//Review>

Nice hidden little gem serving small plates of typical Spanish fare.  The service was quick and the waiter was helpful in suggestions on number of plates to order.  Some of my family had never had tapas and loved the experience of being able to try different things.  The space can get a little loud, but I think it could also be an intimate environment for a date night.<//Review>

<review>The food is amazing, the wine list is perfect, the food comes out at the perfect speed, and the service is very good. I always sit at the bar and talk with the chefs and sometimes the people sitting next to me. The owner is friendly and personable, and sometimes his son is the host at the front door. Phlight is a gem.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Followed chief Julio from his previous restaurant. Hope he never moves to the 'end of the earth' as we will have to follow him there as well. Wonderful, interesting and tasty dishes. Thanks Chief!</Text>

<Review>I love the cozy yet place to be atmosphere. The food is great. Familiar but with a unique twist on flavor. I like that the portions are perfect for sharingou so try a variety of dishes.  My favorite were the fried lentils with Serrano ham and the bacon wrapped dates. The one thing that sticks out in my mind was the service. The wait staff were courtesy, knowledgeable, and very attentive.</Review>< gmap_id>

Food was absolutely delicious. The flavors amazing! I would recommend the "roasted brussels sprouts" and the "arugula salad" with any of their main dishes. Good variety of wines to choose from. The service was great, very friendly. The  atmosphere was very warm & pleasant. My Mom-n-law & I went there for a mom's night out. A great "date night" place. Casual w/  hint of elegance. Makes for a very comfortable & relaxed  experience.  Looking forward to going next with my husband.</Text>

We always over order but never regret it. Bacon wrapped dates it's a must, paella is always perfectly cooked. Wine and beer is always flowing. Oh don't forget the lamb, it has this dark molasses sweet sauce that is paired perfectly.< /text>< Pics>

We went to a restaurant half a block from Phlight (Seats) . To have dinner. The service was terrible and the menu and wine list were Limited. We just had a glass of wine and left. Walked to Phlight and what a difference. Great service, amazing food and the wine list was not that big, but they had a few good wines at a great price. AAA service</Text>

A great dinner spot! I came on a Thursday and was surprised to find it a little empty. The decor was friendly, and it held a very open layout. The service was prompt and amusing. We started off with bacon wrapped dates (amazing) and finished off with the paella. Another great restaurant in Uptown!</Text>

Enjoyed several $3 beers and had a chance to hang out and listen to music. Phlight is a pretty nice space and service didn't get in the way. Didn't have much food but their crab cakes, which weren't bad, so overall a pretty nice place.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Personally my favorite restaurant in town. It's a Tapas place so the plates are small, great for going with friends, sharing, and tasting a little bit of everything. I recommend sharing a pitcher of Sangria.</text>

The food was good but the service was not great. The servers were polite but we were left unattended for long periods of time making us fetch servers on 3 ocassions.

Nice restaurant but I really wish the owners cared more about good service to the there customers.< /Review>

Food was fantastic. They're not always at the top of their game, but even when they're not, it's still very good. Staff is a little inattentive when busy, but they're still quite friendly and helpful.<//review>

<Review>Great food, but  they only take reservations for 6 or more. It's kind of cramped for that many people and if there's more, you won't get to talk to most of them due to the long  seating arrangements. As Yogi Berra once said, "No one goes there anymore.....it's too crowded."   Great food and nice staff.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

This place is great for dinner! Great for date night, GNO, birthdays, catching up with friends ect. Service here is incredible! All the staff here is very nice and on point with services.

Bacon wrapped dates and pork belly taco is excellent!! Two MUST order item when coming here.
Price is very reasonable and everything is so tasty.

Love the ambiance here. Classy and trendy. Definitely coming back!< /review>

Small little place with small plates but the bacon wrapped dates were my favorite,  beers were pretty good here a bit pricy for my budget but well worth it. Good for first time dates.< /Text>

So good! I came back to give this another star because this place just fails to disappoint. Quality house sangri, bacon wrapped dates, and that almond-olive snack are all a must have - every time! Also, had a bday celeb here late 2016 w/ a dozen people... it worked out fine.</Text>

<Text>Disappointed by the plate size for the price . Maybe .... if people try the larger plates it's worth it , but  for being a Tapas Menu it was more like an appetizer menu. I don't exaggerate when I say I have had appetizer plates bigger than their regular plates. In one plate I literally had four pieces of cheese filled bacon with honey . It tasted good, but this should be categorized as an appetizer that feeds one person and should not be 9 dollars. My recommendation from brief observation  is hire more cooks  and less waiters ; they were all nice , but stood around at times and it's not their fault because they're waiting for the food to come out. I would also say change up the menu or appetizer section and explain the portions. In addition, they served us a wrong plate and we let somone know ( the guy cleaning up) really nice and attentive and he let the waiter know ...they took our plate and then gave it to other table , it just not a good view... I would say the service was the only good thing about this place.<//Text>< time>

Today was my mom's birthday & myself my brother & nephew where really excited to have dinner there because of the experience from family & other friends that have gone there . Well the place is really nice with good music very nice cleaned  but, when we ordered our dinner my brother & my mom's food was served in about 10 mins that's fine. But my order of paella & my nephews  hamburger wasn't served until over 30 mins. Actually I cancelled my paella because my brother & my mom.where just about finished with there dinner. Also my nephews hamburger was served 40 mins later so my brother just took it to go. This is the first time for me ever in any resturant  to wait that long for dinner. I've heard how good this resturant is  from alot of people especially my brother but I guess I'll never no because I will never go there to ever again. If our waiter would of told me that my dinner was going to take a little longer to serve I would of ordered something else from there menu.< /review>

I had read the reviews, both positive and not positive, yet I came with an open mind.

Let's start with the menu. The menu has a very simple and pragmatic approach to fine cuisine. The menu doesn't overwhelm you with complex combo platters like Chilis, BJ's, the YardHouse or the Olive Garden. More than often these large national restaurant chains try to fill you up with the main course item, complimented with a "side of something". Often the side of something is rice, potatoes or some sort of carb based food item to fill you. Phlights menu is a very a la carte offering; you order exactly what you see and will have made fresh to order.

The menu has a nice well rounded assortment of seafood, steaks and chicken. The wine list was neatly organized too. There was California wines and Spanish wines as well.

Service. My wife and I opted for counter top service on the bar. The server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. He took our order, and brought our meals in stages. Service was impeccable. We gave the server a 10.

Cooking and preparation. As we sat on the counter top area,we could see our ala carte meals being prepared. Every meal was prepared exactly how I liked my food. Our meals were not massed prepared with other customers orders.

Our order: Diablo Spicey Shrimp, Empanadas, Flank Steak and parsley yellow rice.I spend 2-3 months in Europe every year and I'll spend a few days in Spain. All the meals had the look and taste of Spanish Mediterranean cuisine that I had previously enjoyed in times before. The meals were absolutely delicious. The shrimp could have used a pinch of salt and fresh roasted garlic, but that is more of my personal taste.

Environment. The setting is perfect. It's nice and classy with a large open room of tables that neatly are aligned in such a way were you and your guests are able to enjoy super and friendly conversations without the people sitting next not eavesdropping. So there is a sense of privacy.  Another big plus is this restaurant is not loud with blaring TV'splaying sporting events, where the TV is so loud that you have to speak over the TV volume.

If you are looking for quiet and romantic setting for two or small group gathering getting together for a night out or special occasion - this is the place.

Phlight restaurant has Spanish Mediterranean look and feel with meals that will compliment the setting.

When you walk out of Phlight - I guarantee you you would have enjoyed a memorable experience.

< review>
Came here with my best friend and the ambience was lovely, the service was very friendly and alert, but the food was okay. It was a new place we wanted to try out so we ordered the Brussel sprouts, the ahi tuna tostada, and the lengua tacos. We wanted to order a couple more things, but they were 86'd, we didn't mind. They only had enough lengua for one taco, so half an order, so we asked if we could do one lengua and one pork belly. The lengua taco was on point, it was so well cooked and flavored that I would go back just for that.  The pork belly, not so much. It had a mild flavor and it was too charred for my taste. The sauces that came with both tacos were delicious and paired well with the tacos. The roasted brussel sprouts came next,  the flavor of the dish was very cohesive and flavorful, but it got boring halfway through and the balsamic sauce became too powerful. The ahi tuna tostada was a big disappointment. The tuna was finely minced, or grinded, but there was not much flavorful except for the pico.

We finished our shared dishes and moved onto dessert. We had the chocolate soufflé and the banana pudding. The soufflé was lackluster, it didn't scream this was well executed. The bread pudding as well, the ice cream they used for both plates were delicious, only because they were Tillamook ice cream.

I won't write off this place just yet, will come back and I feel like they will change my opinion.< /review>

<review>This was the 2nd time I had stopped here,  this I was with an older friend and my son.  The owner said I had 9 people ahead of me and offered my son something to drink but not I it my friend.  This lady/owner had the rudest customer service. I'm sorry to say but I never felt like skin color  mattered.  She sure made me feel this way!</review><Gmap_id>0x54cfcb0e1453cbaf:0x87446a0c39256217< /Gmap_id>< date>

The food is delicious, friends staff and patrons. The prices are great and there's a shop right next door if you need anything. Would recommend for anyone traveling to visit this cafe.

Don't forget to try the pancake challenge! They are great!< /Text><GmapID>0x54cfcb0e1453cbaf:0x87446a0c39256217<//GmapID><user>106147733551310450818< /user>< Response>

<text>Breakfast is offered until 11am, but you can do the pancake challenge all day long (open until 2pm), but you may have to wait for the griddle to be free. The challenge is to eat 5 giant pancakes, each being 1 inch thick and 18 inches in diameter.

The operator said that only 4 people have completed the challenge in ten years. That says something about the huge amount of food you are trying to consume, since a lot of hungry PCT hikers come through the restaurant.</text></record>

Source tufa area is a federal property. It is free for the holder of the U.S. National Park Annual Pass, otherwise you pay $3 per adult. It is free for children under 16. There are national park rangers patrolling the area.

This vista point is located south of the Mono Lake. If you drive from yosemite park, turn right on hwy 390 at Tioga pass for couple of miles, then make a left turn on 120 East for another mile or two, make a left turn again on Test Station road. There is a half mile unpaved road that will finally lead you to the parking lot.  As many folks pointed out, there is constant traffic enforcement on highway 395, the car before us was moving at 80 miles per hour and got a ticket, it looks like a speed trap to me. Just drive slowly!

This place is one of the most famous photography spots near Yosemite Nation Park. We arrived in the afternoon, which is not usually a good time for taking pictures. But there was a summer thunder storm around the lake. Park ranger told us it is rare to have thunder storm at this time of the year. In July, the temperature can easily go to upper 90 Fahr. But we are lucky, the weather is cool, and scattered rains drove away the flies and the water did not smell as said by others.

Do not climb the Tufa tower, I happened to see a park ranger warned a couple who climbed to the Tufa Tower for a better selfie, bad idea.
Due to Covid-19,  there are no more naturalist guided canoe tour this summer.< /text>

<Date>1552451773474</Date><rating>5</rating><Review>The amazing to come especially around the sunset time. It’s at the south of mono lake. You can see lots of tufa, a rare Glacier relic. In Banff, they just show off their only tufa there, but here, hundreds of tufa you can see. They look like army. Under sunset, sky and lake turn yellow, the red. It let you feel the end of life. So pretty but sad.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn1MNNTifpy3w_eBwBgrpnFEgj2lbbNZ9vw8LE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBu_02QNNC9B4MoDwNGPvM-23So-4yrAudB8Tq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0BRqbIWkYP2f_4nNpjWpPmlh3sxWCi7N_6Und=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxM7cTStPtLqw1WB7-rfdWZcv4bPpWo4LeVB2G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCBC572kYuGS69pkwhebnfJMcz7NKMrq1EYtVD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuNu6OHre-qyVAqPyEqPC6Ao-51GyI0eXB73p2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt8GcbwSN4BdM4Tik6VtzkbDn_I_Jry9hpgz8x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBnGPHnJI5PK8XYO1KJ0L25jZpLZrG8GDBw88p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr-Rdtlw2SmKs2WYzUPOELalNMPQmT5zzch5zx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnpB2GWUyAL7e8kE5QyjZFaldOpZyNUcJQg5_W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1x6xT6BJiNCmVNyB-muzBKlMBWCbOZGbrv2i-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOC-Xva12kPs0nCb9nxfZwo7iV24NZwDRqVo6Wy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZCsnK-QuuJnmN0Nb0ueIltUjmH9lL4_DCp6UA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf2k6Z47g-IctxcQFYun6onhxf4uo-G65T9WJd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhOTEL8osIBdoh6nep7D5WjrtFOq5bZTFxLVKl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

It's not very common to get exceptional service these days. A lot of employees are not taken care of very well so that shows when it is time to provide service to the client. But when it does happen it is more than just a little noticeable . It is truly amazing. That is what my experience was like with Brandon Anderson he was courteous but firm when he told me what the policies were. However I needed a special exception and it was declined by Management. I tried to solve the issue on my own but it was more than I could handle you see because I am disabled. When I came back to Brandon he went the extra mile for me and I am so impressed with his people skills. He made it important to help an old man who needed help.  Unfortunately most people wouldn't take the time. He told me in eleven years he had not had to do what I needed. Even with the task of managing his regular task he went out of his way to help me and I will be forever grateful.

This man is a true "Champion" . Brandon Thank you so much. I appreciate you going the extra mile and I want everyone to know the kind of person you are. They say Character is the person you are when nobody is looking. I am sure your Parent's would be proud to know the Man you have become.

God Bless you Thank you for going the extra mile for me

Regards

I was looking for a good deal for a short term storage solution and StorQuest had a really good deal of first month free and discounted rates.  The place is spotless clean!  Staff is very professional and payment system is easy to pay online.  Pretty straight forward for a storage, highly recommend if this area is good for you!</text>

Excellent property manager at the Ranch Cucamonga, CA location. Super professional and fast guy. He truly made the difference when it comes to customer service. He keeps the property in mint condition and takes care of the customers.< /Text>

Place is very clean and organized.
Great safe location with 24 hour surveillance.
Storage prices are reasonable.
Couldn't ask for a better, and very dependable spot.
I'd definitely recommend storquest to close family and friends.<//review>< date>

It all worked out better than expected. I got lucky and received a first month discount. The guy at the front was super friendly and showed me a couple options. Price was right where I wanted. Secure place. Gate code in and to get out. Highly recommend.< /Review>

I happened upon this storage facility by accident, but it ws a great experience. The whole experience was great. The staff was friendly and  knowledgeable.  I was able to find the right size storage unit I needed the same day. Prices were competitive.< /Review>

I needed a storage unit and after seeing all the positive Reviews for StorQuest Rancho, Cucamonga, it was no wonder why people continue to come here.

I was helped by Brandon. He is very knowledgeable and hospitable. The facilities are clean and well kept.

I recommend you stop by StorQuest Rancho Cucamong first before looking elsewhere (if possible).<//text>

I was glad he did because I had to use the restroom and he took me  and  he gave us ice cold water again and he took me back. I really appreciated his care and concern. I would recommend StorQuest to all my family and friends, especially the RANCHO CUCAMONGA location!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Less than helpful been shopping with this storage service for years only to be prompted to enroll in this or that when calling to see my storage hours. Furthermore telling me inaccurate information about my storage. Many storage options might be time for me to change up and others to avoid<//text>

This place was fantastic. The girl up front was suuuuper helpful! She made sure I was happy with the sizing and location of the storage before purchasing. She also helped me out with a lock and to get the special hours for setting up auto pay. The gentleman there was also super helpful as well in letting me know my emergency contact I put down will also have access to the garage. Let’s just say this place pays attention to the finite details and they were absolutely amazing! Thanks guys!< /text>

Brandon was very helpful he went above and beyond assisting me. During this time of covid 19 things are very uncertain. So during this time I really appreciate how he worked with us and showed ginuwine concern in trying to help. He was very professional and showed compassion in a time like this. I would highly recommend store quest  for your storage needs particularly this location because of his management.<//Review>

Jasmine helped me out and she is very nice and did such a good job and answered any question I asked. She’s very patient as well. When I arrived she was dealing with a very rude customer and his family and she handled it very professionally despite the man and his family being incompetent.< /Text>< user>

<review>Friday May 29th 2020.
I had stopped by to drop off and pick up a few things from storage. I had a few questions and headed inside. I spoke to a young girl named Jasmine. She was very polite, friendly and professional. She answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable. She made my experience with StorQuest not only a good one but a great one. I think her customer service skills are outstanding! You guys would do well to take good care of her, treat her wel and promote her and of course give her a raise. She's definitely an asset to StorQuest and I look forward to continuing to do business with you guys now and in the future because of her.

Sincerely,
Randy H.</review>< UserId.>

My wife and I really appreciate the time Alexis spent answering our questions and concerns!  In the past we've had less than favorable experiences dealing with other storage facilities, but we were very pleased with the level of professionalism and customer service at StorQuest.  We look forward to future business with them!<//Review>

<Text>StorQuest Self Storage is one of the best storage facilities i've ever rented from. The facility premises was extra clean, well maintained and the customer service is superb. The office manager, Tyrone was there for my move in and move out period. He made  sure my relocation move went smooth. I highly recommend this storage facility On (Arrow). Thanks StorQuest Self Storage!< /Text></record>

I have been and continue to be a very HAPPY CUSTOMER of StorQuest Self Storage on Arrow Highway near Rochester in Rancho Cucamonga. Every member of the staff that I have come in contact with now and in the past has always been so friendly, helpful and compassionate with a listening ear. And, I just want to say THANK YOU!. This location is so pleasant, very quiet and peaceful. Sometimes I would just go there to clean in my unit and listen to the radio and enjoy the mountain scenery. I never had to worry about my personal belongings in the unit if the weather was very rainy, everything is always just fine. I always recommend my family, friends and anyone I know who needs a storage facility to this location, THANK YOU again StorQuest!</Text>

After reading various reviews of the other local storage options, I decided to go with StorQuest for my storage needs. When I entered the business I was professionally and happily greeted by Tyrone. I told him my needs and specified the size of the unit I was looking for. He quickly found a unit and setup my account. He easily explained the terms and conditions, insurance, payment options, and got me situated. Once that was complete, Tyrone also took me out to show me where the unit was located and explained the key code process. He went the extra mile to provide excellent customer service. If you're going to do business with StorQuest, you MUST do it when Tyrone is available!</review>

When I first started looking for a storage a lot of other places times to access after hours were not open during the times I could make it, and the pricing for the size was expensive. Until I came across StorQuest. Their hours are very convenient to fit my schedule during the week and weekends and the price I paid monthly was a decent amount to fit my pockets monthly! Not to mention they have the best customer service and are very friendly! I would highly recommend this place if you’re needing somewhere to store your belongings for a short or long period of time.</Review>

Alexis was great when myself and my daughter came in to request information about renting a unit.
Tyrone followed up the next day to make sure if I needed any other Information.
I received excellent customer service from Alexis and Tyrone.

When I walked in, Christiane was calmly dealing with a difficult situation over the phone. Some people would let that affect how they react to other customers, but she didn’t.
She was kind, helpful and utterly professional.
She explained everything to me, showed me my storage unit and made sure my access code worked before wishing me a good day.
I’m very pleased I chose this location and had Christiane help me.</text>

<text>I’ve only ever had good experiences at Storequest in the almost year that I’ve been renting there. Access is secure, but comfortable and the facilities are at a great location. Best of all, the customer service is always top notch, with people who answer your questions promptly and with a great sense of humor. Tatiana helped me the other day and she answered my every concern with time left for great conversation. Would recommend.</text><user>111985533007026709476<//user>< pictures>

<text>Alexis at the Rancho Cucamonga StorQuest made it very easy to transition from our old storage unit. She was also helpful with information that the people at the old storage unit did not provide.

This is a great storage location. Tyrone, the facility manager, is outstanding - polite, professional and warm. We had not problem in checking out stuff, this in spite of the fact that our stuff came early am on Monday. The facility is clean, secured, nicely located people are warm.

<text>I've ony been renting here for a few months, but I can honestly say that I have had nothing but wonderful customer service. I have spoken to Ty the manager there, several times with questions and he has always been very helpful and very patient. He took the time to fit me with the best option for a storage unit based on my needs. I had called on several other storage places in the area and StorQuest was able to accommodate me and make my very stressful moving situation stress free. I would highly recommend this place to anyone needing storage< /text>< Rating>

The StorQuest we are using is located in Rancho Cucamonga.

I went in to get a guote and came out with an offer I couldn’t refuse!

Manager and Assistant Manager Tyrone and Alexis just went above and beyond to meet my expectations. And in very little time

Clean facility and perfect location for us

You couldn’t ask for better people then these two that I had the opportunity to get to meet and get acquainted  with

Great hours to come and go to your storage at your convenience!

Glad I stopped in!

<Text>The assistant manager Tatiana is AMAZING! We have had horrible experiences with other storage facilities that left use skeptical and unsure about using any type of storage facilities. Tatiana honestly has gone over and beyond for me and my family. Her level of service stands out from the rest. I have worked in customer service management  for over 15 years so my expectations are usually extremely HIGH!!! Tatiana has surpassed them with flying colors.</Text>< Name>

I have been with storquest for almost three years now, and there services has not changed in a negative way, but in a postive way. There customer service is excellent; they have the free automatic payment, and every time I speak with one of the employees either by phone or in person, they are very professional, well spoken and polite. Choose storquest for your storage 😀< /Text>

Friendly environment. Tatianna is amazing very sweet and helpful. Nice clean and safe place to store your property.  I highly recommend Storquest Self Storage for your storage needs.

Update: I closed out my storage contract last week with StorQuest because I moved out of state and no longer needed their service. It was such a wonderful experience with this facility. Tyrone & Tatiana are the sweetest people you cld ever meet. The facility is well managed, clean and safe. I also believe they are more affordable than other storage companies that I researched. I wld recommend this facility hands down to all my friends and family.👍😊< /Text>

The best hand wax around! The owner waxed my skis himself and spent a good 15 minutes cleaning and waxing. Very friendly and helpful, highly recommend this outdoors store. Will be coming back here in the future!< /review>

Privately owned and operated business for forty years.  Have bought boots here twice in the last 15 years.  Best quality and reasonable prices.  Would recommend visiting if you're serious about outdoor gear.  Great shopping environment and service. Owner is musician and of highest integrity.< /Review>

Provided what we needed. Snow park passes are sold cash only. Female at the counter was downright rude. Seems to be not a people person. I wouldn't deal with her if you can avoid it. Gentleman was quite lovely. I'd talk to him instead if you can manage it.< /text>

Met Bill for the first time tonight. He was under the weather and still took the time to answer all of my questions and get me outfitted properly. I believe locals should support locals and I look forward to many more trips to Ebbetts Pass Sporting Goods and learning from Bill’s vast fishing experience.<//text>

This is the BEST PLACE IN TOWN!
Weather you're going skiing in the Winter or fishing and swimming in the Summer, Boulder Bill and his lovely family have ALL items for Fun Year Round, and is ALWAYS served with a smile, and sometimes even a big hug.

Good place for your hunting and fishing information and bait and stuff. Also great place to get your disc golfing information. The owners are great, too. I stop there everytime I'm in the area just to talk and brag about the fish I caught.< /Text>

< Review>
Great, old fashioned friendly service. Good supply of equipment for a group of half a dozen for beginner ski rentals, including jackets and pants.

One thing to mention is that while the woman behind the counter is helpful, as other reviewers have written she can come across a bit condescending. I was fine, especially since I tended to agree with her useful advice for managing a group of first time skiers and ensuring they were well protected and warm, but if you have thin skin you may not find it tolerable. She should work on her communication style. Making the customer feel stupid, especially tourists likely to write a 1 star review after having their egos bruised, is generally not a good thing for your business.

That said, thank you to all the owners and staff for taking care of us all on our Christmas vacation. A warm Merry Christmas to you all.</Review>

<Text>Bill the owner is amazing. He took his time to pick out a rod and reel to meet my budget and then showed me how to put together the rig for lake fishing. Genuine guy who didn't make me feel embarrassed to ask rookie questions.
Stores like this hardly exist anymore, but when you find one it is a joy.</Text>< Pics>

Bill is a great guy who is always ready to provide information and coaching. His prices are fair, he has a wide array of products in all price ranges, and his attitude is extraordinarily helpful and humble. If you are looking for sporting goods stores in the Western Sierra around Arnold, Ca, this is the place to go.< /Text>

<text>Solid small business that has been holding down the fort for Arnold & Bear Valley in terms of sporting goods for a long time.

They have a knack carrying those items you seem to have forgotten, which makes them indispensable. Also, while their prices are not going to beat walmart/amazon etc., they are fair priced for a small shop up the hill, and you will save greatly in lieu of high ski resort prices

My family built cabin in Arnold since '69.  Many businesses have come and gone with good and bad snow years, and recession.  This business has been here for close to 20 years I believe,  they do a great job for their size.  They always help with whatever they can.  This includes  walking in for fishing advice, even if you didn't need to purchase anything.

A great small business I recommend patronizing if you have the opportunity.</text>< user>

As with other reviews on Yelp, the woman working the counter is very condescending. When we asked for help finding a fly fishing class to take, she said they don't offer them and that they will only do a class for people who buy their gear from them. She then continued to give rude remarks about how we should go back to where we bought our gear. seriously, who turns away paying customers just because we bought our gear at bass pro 3 hrs away? you lost quite a bit of business honey.</text>

Something I'll never forget was when one night, I took three dancers into the VIP  : ) : ) : )

It's just a wonderful place, I have been going here for years and the dancers are just gorgeous. The stage show is awesome and it never stops, the topless dances are fantastic and the VIP is spectacular. I have never been disappointed here.

I've checked out a few other places over the years, but by far, Tropical Lei wins hands down. I look forward to going back many more times.</Review>

Obviously, people reviewing this place are upset that a service business is actively trying to solicit their business. I only rated it 4 stars because like others, I go there to unwind, not be propositioned for my money. That said, the ladies are super sweet and worth every penny. Best VIP I've had so far in my limited experience in strip clubs. I would like to see a standard price for a half hour VIP session, as 3 songs can go by quickly. I especially enjoy spending time with Ayden<//text>

<Text>15 bucks to get in and you have to buy a drink every hour (its a non alcoholic drink). I did not mind the entrance fee but the drink needs to  be alcoholic!

This place also has crusty fat chicks.</Text>< username>

< Review>
I went in tonight around 7 (on New Years eve) to buy a bowl. The girl who was working (she was the only one there) was unfriendly and seemed to rush me out of the store as if it would help her go home faster. I’m sure her shift didn’t end until 8/9? If she didn’t want the job maybe she shouldn’t work there? Def not the service expected of I’m paying $12 for a poke bowl.< /Review>

<Review>Fresh and tasty! Like sushi but better, with a choice of brown or white rice, chips, salad or a mix of any two. They have a ton of fish choices, too. Salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, seared tuna, etc. Then you do the toppings. You can pick from all kinds of veg, seaweed salad, fried garlic, all types of sauces and avocado for an extra buck. They have Hawaiian juices to pick from. It was very delicious and the staff was so nice!<//Review>< userid>

Best Thing is they have Seared Ahi... Not too Many Places have this and it's plain and simple the best fish.< /Text>

<text>Yummy! I don't normally try something new but I am glad I did! I had a small bowl with tofu on rice and a few fresh ingredients including the seaweed salad ( 1 dollar upcharge) totally worth it and so yummy! Its a build your own bowl ( either salad or rice) and the small was so much so had half left over! It has a very small dining area, maybe 7 or 8 tables and 1 highchair. They also had free cucumber lemon water out with cups! Will totally be back!</text>< Pics>

I used to go here 4 days a week for lunch and it was great, not so much anymore. This place is going downhill fast by cutting costs. They used to have a punch card that was a great system and now its gone, the bowls they use have changed to a cheap cardboard (that changes the way your food tastes) when they were plastic before, the prices have gone up and im pretty sure the portions and quality have gone down. I'm not happy at all about these changes and I miss the old Poki Poki.

To the owner, stop getting cheap to make a quick buck.. you had loyal customers that are now going to the competition.< /Review>

First time trying this place and I'm pleased with the food and the service. The probs are adequate and the flavors are good. I had a lot of questions for the server as it was my first time trying poke but sure was helpful and accommodating.
The place is clean and we'll lit, the seafood looks fresh and tastes good.< /text>

<Review>Generally, I really like poke. It's hard to get wrong, it's fresh, it's fast, it's tasty. Of the many poke places I've dined, I think I'm giving this a 4 star rating maybe because of the ingredient combo I chose. I dunno. I may try again with a different mix, but I'm finding that it's often the sauce that can make or break a good poke. Stay tuned.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Honestly the food here isn't great. Since this place has a 4.5 stars and after reading everyone's reviews I figured okay, let's give this place a shot. Yah well I was definitely misinformed. I paid 15 dollars for a small bowl of poke and a drink.... that's insane!!!
Definitely a rip off considering I only got small portion of salmon.
If you really want a REAL poke place to go in Temecula, check out Poke n Salad. Now that place is truly up to standard. Not only can
2 people eat for less than 25 dollars but the food is amazingly delicious!!! Oh and not to mention the customer service is excellent too!</text>< pics>

Ask the community
Since when does Poki Poki start to charge extra for a topping without notifying anyone. Wow. !!! Why not move the crab meat to the side of the raw sushi if your going to cry about how EXPENSIVE it is. Not happy with the change in policy without notification. !!! Won't be coming for your hoki poki anymore. Love Boat Sushi all day .. at least their advertising is honest.< /text>

<Text>This is only the third time I've visited Poki poki. I love eating here: it's very fast, clean, fresh and tasty. Maybe I'm out of touch with pricing but I think the prices could be a tad lower. I order the small portion and it's just about enough to get rid of my hunger pangs. Wish there could be more given for the price or else drop the price a little for what's serced. But overall, a nuce place to ge something to just fill you up till yiur bext, real meal.< /Text><UserId.>101564198940646700930</UserId.>< Response>

I went here for the first time on 12/21/18 and the young lady helping me was super rude. The place had 2 patrons sitting and eating and I felt like the lady was rushing me to hurry up and pick the scoops of meat, sauces, etc. There was no one behind me and I even stated “sorry it’s my first time here”. She didn’t once smile at me which should’ve been the first sign of disappointment. Lucky there was another young man working who was much nicer when checking me out. He smiled, thanked me and had a much better attitude than the young lady that looked as though she’d rather get hit by a car than help me. I felt the prices were a little steep, but I love and was craving poki. I took my meal to go, and the second I headed toward the door the young lady started chatting it up with the young man, laughing and seemingly much better than she was moments before when serving me. (so rude!) nonetheless I figured maybe she had been working all day or had a rough day or something so I tried to chalk it up to nothing. But when I went home the poki bowl was just ok. The sauces weren’t really adding to the dish and I’ve had much tastier poki elsewhere. I won’t be back, sadly. I was let down and would much rather take my business to Poki N Salad. Their poki is delicious, fresh, their sauces are super flavorful, they have larger servings with a cheaper price, AND the employees smile and are nice to you when ordering.< /text>

Staff is very courteous and they have a decent collection of stuff. Fitting rooms off-limits ay present due to some kind of overhead water leak. Parking lot is another train wreck courtesy of early 1960s design myopia.</Text>< pics>

Almost new and very usable which I am sure they will sell for over $200. Then I went back inside to get a boiling pot not for food but for a hobby work. There were a pot set that seemed would do the job so I picked it up, it had another pot sticking inside it, didn't need the smaller one but picked it up anyway. When I went to the counter to pay had to wait for half an hour coz they only open 1line and 1 lady runs the transactions, the lady up front seemed rude and badly behaved, she tore out the small pot from inside the big pot and told me that's not together! And looked at me like I was trying to get 2 for price of 1. I told her that's just how it was on the racks anyway don't need the smaller pot. She then called another older guy (this person just took donations from me) who told her no I didn't do that and looked at me rudely like I was wanting to take both?! I mean that's just how it was on the shelves and I don't care about the small pot but these people are less than thankful for the donations and they are greedy and ill behaved at this location. Such a shame for a store that calls itself GoodWill!

AVOID this location. I will not be bringing my donations to this disgusting place from now on.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Told me to take my donation across the street to Salvation Army
After waiting 45 minutes for them to open, and another ten minutes to be belittled.

This Goodwill is always full of great gems! Helpful and mostly happy crew, they have working here. Pricing has gotten almost the same as retail prices in all the Goodwill's around this area, which makes It especially hard to commit to buying jeans without being able to try them on first!!? Just saying.... Not going to happen!!< /Text>

<Review>pulled up to donation station at 3:55pm. only had two small boxes of toddler clothes to donate, really good quality stuff. the rude worker said "no more donations today, we close at 4" and walked away. seriously? you're actually still open! i cant just hand you two boxes??

Update - tried again last week, this time went around 1pm. Was again turned away, but this time the reason was "no donations while we're loading the truck." SMH, you're open for donations at this time!

Update #2 - The same older guy there tried to turn me away again. I advised him that it says online they're open until 6. He said no they close at 2. I said okay but it's only 1:50.  He said 'yeah but there are two cars ahead of you..." I said no problem and just rolled up my window and got in line, and was able to donate. You just need to ignore that guy, he tries to turn people away so that he has less work to do. He's probably there for mandated community service.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<rate>3< /rate><Resp>None<//Resp><text>I've been going to this store for 11 years. This is a small footprint store that has some of the best donations of any second-hand store I've visited. The quality of goods is easily it's main draw. After that, it's downhill. Often you are charged more than the signage dictates. You often don't know the price as staff doesn't follow its own pricing policy. Very frustrating. I've seen people urinating directly in front of the store in broad daylight, seen attacks, assaults, people snorting cocaine while sitting up against the stores veneer. I've personally removed grafitti of male appendages from the stores side brickwork. Not a fun shopping experience, not structured pricing, but very good donations indeed...although the best now gets put online in auctions. Police frequent the store. Be prepared.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This is a critique of the donation station:
Just tried to donate a rug to Goodwill. It has no stains and came from a house with no animals, no smoking, wood flooring (the pictures show carpeting under the rug, I took these photos when I arrived at another house, perturbed that I still had it), and a very low traffic room. I have been to this location numerous times to donate items that are still in good condition with no stains or tears and have been turned away because it would not blend in with the other items on the sales floor. I have finally learned my lesson and have decided to stop wasting my time sorting between items that have tears and/or stains and items that do not. I am going to throw everything away. When I return home, I will be cutting the rug up and dumping it in my trash to be picked up on Tuesday morning.

Fifteen years ago this store accepted anything that was still in sale condition, now they pick and choose depending on how it will look in their store. I guess donating to Goodwill is not for me. I am saying good riddance to donating and hello to land fills. (Do not suggest the two others in walking distance of my house, they are even more critical of donations).

The attached photos have horrendous lighting (They were deleted the first time I tried to post them, if they are not attached, it's because they were deleted again in the upload process). The rug has two shades of green, two shades of brown, and one cream, and one grey.</text>

I dropped off some donations here recently. They only take a maximum of six bags of clothing. So I ended up giving a couple of extra bags I had to another person that was dropping off stuff so I wouldn't have to come back on a later date.<//review>

I dropped off some donations and found it to be well staffed with easy parking and extended hours. They have a dedicated side door on the side street (Doris Drive) to receive donations during receiving hours: please *do not* drop stuff off after their generous schedule! They keep the area tidy.< /Text>

<review>Walked into the front to ask the guy if we could donate a desk, and he said yes, just go around back. Drove around to the back and tried to donate the office desk since it says on their website they accept furniture, the guy in the back just goes "no furniture" and walks away.  If you're going to be the exception to your non profits rule then post a sign so I don't waste my time.< /review>< Pics>

The people were friendly but there was a long line of cars. Also one day they were only taking clothes and the next day they were taking everything but clothes. So beware. I think this is more of an issue in the afternoon.</Review>

They rejected duplos legos on their original container as a donation. Also rejected 1/2 full box of brand new shot glasses- about a dozen. They started picking through my stuff and making me take it back without the Box.< /Review>

Don't waste your time taking donations here. There is a very rude man working there and apparently they don't need any donations.<//review>

ONE DOLLA MAKES ME HOLLA

Whether or not the higher-ups of this not-for-profit business are making a lot of money, I support Goodwill because 1) I like discounted items, 2) its important to reuse, 3) the company hires people who may otherwise face challenges with employment.

This Goodwill in particular can be disorganized at times, mostly due to its rather large size. For the most part, houseware and clothing are kept separate, so I can't complain if slacks are mixed in with jeans. I'm more likely to shop for clothes in Walnut Creek or Danville thrift stores anyhow, unless I'm looking for new Burning Man outfits; but those usually find me without much searching.

On that note, I've scored some amazing and fun pieces of desert clothing in this store. And I have fun walking around it, even when I leave empty-handed.<//Text><name>Amy Palmer<//name><resp>None< /resp><Rating>3< /Rating>< Pics>

<Text>Its OK. Prices seem higher than other thrift stores. Customer service (for lack of a better word) sucks, if it is anywhere near closing time. Maybe I just happen to be there when every employee was over tired and hated to be there. I walk out ,even if I had planned on purchasing things ,because of that type of behavior. Its OK, saves me money.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Greg was friendly, up front and honest.  He discussed our options with us and was very knowledgeable and informative.  He added refrigerant and replaced the capacitor. We had cold air immediately! I am thrilled with Hyde’s & I will definitely request Greg as our technician for future service calls!</review>< user_id>

Great customer service until I called to complain about the fact that the technician repaired my unit without my authorization. I was told that the technician would call me with diagnostic and cost before any work was completed on my unit. I received a call from the technician after the fact and ready with my credit card. When I called to complain, the person on the phone said she would have paid for the service either way. She would have paid up to $300 to have cool air to sleep which leads me to believe that this may be a common practice of theirs. The service manager called me back, Berry Hyde. He tried to explain that I must have misunderstood. I know that I did not and I know this because the customer service representative stated that the information was in the notes to the technician. Mysteriously the phone disconnected and Berry never bothered to call me back. They are brushing me away. I mean if you go anywhere for repairs, common practice is to explain to the customer what the issue is and then provide the cost...i don't know why it would be different here. Like I said, it seems to be the practice. Please beware of your interactions with this company.<//Text>

<text>After too many ripoffs over a lifetime to ever fully trust repair or replacement services, we were leery of getting our water heater replaced. A friend introduced us to HYDE who sent Israel over to assess and estimate. O. M. G what a wonderful young man! He correctly established the best option for replacement... And as of today we have a beautiful new 40 gallon energy efficient heater. Israel is so polite, genuinely gentle, and proud to be part of Hyde for its high values and ethics. His work is meticulous. We HIGHLY appreciate Israel and the whole team...THUMBS UP!!</text><GmapID>0x80dafbeb644242cd:0xd3a7f71b45fcdc4< /GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<text>Ok so I have waited to do this rating AGAIN. Hyde's is a very good company BUT there are lots of very good air-conditioning companies.
They will tell you OVER and OVER how they really care about customer service.. But so does everyone else and every where you go. The difference is IF a company delivers on great company service. For Hydes I would say NO ! Did they do a good job in selling  (yes) did they do a good job installing (yes) but all the little things the things that are important to ME and i would assume other they FAILED. Examples when they did my instal they never replaced my air filters. When I asked why they said they should have… But NEVER sent someone over to take care of it. Only when they had to come to complete inspection PRIOR to the city coming and I complained again and they sent someone over. Well they had the wrong size. SO they replaced on (of three) I happen to find an old one in my garage so they used that. But the third one they did not have. So they wanted to bend one in half and put that in there. I said NO . Now GREAT customer service would mean the next day TODAY they would be here with a new one to replace it (or at least call me to set an appointment) Nothing. The city has to come to sign off on final permit so they told me the city would be here today. and the city would call me in the morning. I told Hydes I would be out in the morning and back at 10 am. Hyde's said well you can call the city and tell them that. GREAT customer service would have said what time would you like them there and I will work with the city to try to meet your time. NOT offered.
The final item that really upset me today is the city came and had to go up to the attic area. When they lifted up the access door it seems Hydes maintenance person painted it closed so it chipped when they pushed on. That is when I noticed that when Hydes first came to do the job it had a frame around the inside of the panel to hide any areas that did not sit properly. They never replaced it back to how it was before they started. Again GREAT customer service would have taken pictures and made sure it was done the way it was prior to the start. (see Photo) so are the well priced YES are the quick YES did they do good work (it works and is better then my old one) would I say they have great or even good customer service NO even though they will tell you HOW IMPORTANT it is over and over again. To do it is more then saying it. Now I have to start the conversation with them to fix this. I'll report back how that goes.
Just honest feedback and info for those who care to read it.<//text>< response>

My AC quit on me and I called several companies. Hyde's was the ONLY company that responded promptly. The tech came promptly and took care of business. I can't tell you how many times I blessed these people!!!</text>

<Name>Jonni Bash<//Name><text>Hyde's Air Conditioning is simply the best!  Whether it's just regular servicing, a problem or needing a whole replacement. The service and follow up from the front desk to all the service staff is beyond reproach.  They are honest, hard working and truly want you to be happy with their quality of service.  There isn't another company in the valley that I could ever recommend higher than Hyde's.  Thanks Guys!< /text><Response>None<//Response><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

<Text>It's great working with a family business like Hyde's. Everyone there has skin in the game and their responsiveness, professionalism and quality of work reflects this. They were recommended by a neighbor. I called and got great info over the phone without the pressure of a salesperson trying to get me to use them. When I finally decided to have them do maintenance on my AC they scheduled quickly, arrived on time, gave a clear report on the condition of my system, did the necessary maintenance (replace filter, etc.), and gave me options on how to improve my system without having to buy a new unit. It's such a breath of fresh air to work with a company that takes care of you in every step of the process. I highly recommend them!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
My elderly mom is a resident in Palm Desert and recently widowed. She has had a service agreement in place with Hyde for her HVAC system for the past several years. During that time, they have done a great job to keep her ancient HVAC system working properly. During the last inspection, the service person noted that the furnace is at the end of it's life and suggested that it be replaced. This proposition was a bit overwhelming for her but the team at Hyde walked her through the options, payment plans, etc. and found the proper equipment at a price she could afford. Hyde does such a great job of servicing seniors. They are kind, compassionate, trustworthy, and really care about their customers. They went above and beyond in this case and as her son living many miles away, I could not thank them enough for taking such great care of my mom during this time.< /Review>

<review>Excellent customer service. The technician was professional and courteous. Took his time looking  thoroughly at my air conditioner unit. Thank goodness he didn’t find a problem. Made no effort to “over sell” something I didn’t need. Will definitely use Hyde’s again for my air conditioning needs.
I’m happy to support a local , family run business in the valley. I highly recommend this company.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>As having just purchased a 2nd home in the Valley, I wanted to better understand our HVAC systems.  Greg DeFondes of Hydes was timely, efficient, professional, friendly and, in addition to providing full maintenance on our two systems, took the time to explain each of our system, their operation and status.  In a nutshell, Greg was an excellent representative of Hydes.

Additionally, we have ordered extra equipment from Hydes, and we will make every effort to schedule our availability around that of Greg's so he can do the installations.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><username>luke boi</username></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Our heating & A/C system was at the end of it's expected life. We had called for a service to get the A/C working and Johnathon did so. He was very thorough and gave us all details regarding future maintenance vs. installation of a new system. We felt very comfortable with the way the facts were presented to us & we concluded the best idea was to replace an aging system that appeared to need continued maintenance & or repair. Hyde's has been consistently on time, professional, price competitive & trustworthy. That's all you can expect a service provider to do!</Review>

<text>I was having a problem with my remote and the serviceman checked out what the problem was.  Due to a unique positioning of the hideaway bed the fan was not positioned to blow out into the room.  He explained how to adjust the fans so the problem would not occur.  The serviceman was very professional and prompt.  As always a great experience with Hyde's.</text>< gmap_id>

<Review>From the receptionist to the service tech that came to our home, everything was amazing. Very professional and knowledgeable. The service tech was great with my young children that followed him around and he was even good with our large puppy. He provided maintenance on our ac system, cleaned and replaced the filter. He filled us in on every step as he went. We definitely reccomend Hyde's for all your AC and electrical needs. Truly a great company with high family values and standards.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Taylor from Hyde's was AWESOME!!!  He called me prior to arriving for the bi-yearly maintenance on my HVAC system to let me know he was on his way.  He was very attentive and let me know exactly what maintenance he performed on the system.  He answered every question I had and offered advice on how to save energy costs in my home.  He is EXTREMELY professional, and there is no doubt he really cares about his customers.  I highly recommend Hyde's!<//text>

As usual, tech was on time, wore covers  for his work shoes and a maskmom. He of course checked my air Conditioning unit on the roof and left.  I was busy tending to my I'll husband so when he was done I thanked him and he left.  I later noticed he didn't change the filter so I called Hydes and was told he would return before 5pm.  He did return and with great pride in his work showed me he did change the filter. I apologized and thanked him for returning rather then just calling. He was gracious and told me it was his pleasure. Armando is a great tech that works for a great company.</text>

He had the replacement part on the truck, but the motor was rusted in place. He removed the housing & took it back to the shop to machine out. No additional cost. Brought it all back the next day & installed. Works better than it did before. Really happy with their service & their expertise.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Hydes installers are technical experts and they effectively installed the system without any delay or issues.

Used Hyde’s as they are a family owned business, always very polite and prompt service.  However I don’t recommend them for electrical services as that service is ridiculously overpriced. Had them replace a simple outlet with a GFI and they charged us almost $300 for the GFI and 5 minutes of work involving putting 3 screws back in the outlet! Very disappointed and will forever think I was robbed.< /text>

<Review>Our A/C just stopped working. We had a very narrow window on short notice to get cooled down and Hyde was able to squeeze us in on a Saturday. Our unit is 20+ years old and we expected to be advised to get a new unit. James tested a few things and determined it was just a capacitor that needed to be replaced, not the compressor or the whole unit. James and his apprentice were on time (including a text notification when they were on the way), friendly, professional, efficient and took all Covid precautions inside and out. Highly recommend this family owned business and signed up for their reasonable maintenance program, which also got us a discount on this service call.< /Review>< userid>

<time>1598990343833<//time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I am so disappointed with this company.   They came out to repair a five year old AC unit.  Filled the system with 5 gallons of Freon, only to have that freon depleted in two days.  Came out again to do a leak detection and advised that my AC Unit had a problem with the coils and the unit needed to be replaced.  I was suspect at this diagnosis and called another company out (thankfully), who performed their own leak check and determined it was the Reversing Valve that was causing the leak and that was the only item that needed replacing.  I watched the second tech as they showed me the leak.  This type of service by Hyde's is unacceptable and they clearly wanted to up sell me an entire AC unit, as it was easier and made more money for them.  Shame on you!   It took a second company to perform an thorough analysis of my problem to come up with a more reasonable solution.   Will never consider Hyde's again.  Buyer beware!< /Text>< Pics>

We are thrilled with the quick installation of our new HVAC unit. Of course our old unit went out when it was 111 degrees outside and guests on the way. Hyde’s quickly diagnosed the problem with our 18 year old unit and had a new unit installed in less than 48 hours. The technicians were on-time, extremely professional and knowledgeable and also very neat and clean. We are so impressed with everyone we’ve encountered with the company and highly recommend them.

Jonathan explained everything about my system which, as a new homeowner, was invaluable. Now I know how to take care of it and what to expect going forward. I appreciate his transparency, sincerity and professionalism. I look forward to seeing him on my next service visit already! :-)

Update: Johnny was here (different technician) to install a whole house surge protector. He was informative, helpful and patient in terms of answering all my questions.

Hydes is a great company with happy employees. That is the real test of a good company. Happy to be a customer!<//Review>

<text>The technician was very professional and helpful in explaining over the phone the issue with the AC unit at our rental property. He also took time with the tenant to educate him on ways to maintain the unit to prevent future issues.  Very happy with the professionalism of this company from start to finish.<//text></record></dataset><record>

After purchasing a home in Palm Springs, we called Hyde's for maintenance of the AC system, which the company had installed about 2 1/2 years ago.  The $149 a year maintenance package seemed reasonable to me, and it was a simple process to set up an appointment.  The lady who helped me on the phone was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Then the appointment arrived, and Casey was early and ready to go on a hot afternoon.  He navigated the floor and room renovations that a were going on in the house, working around the crew with ease.  From first conversation with him, I knew we were in good hands.  Casey took his time , changed out filters, checked ducts, and drainage pipes, all the while explaining things to me in easy-to-understand terms.  We also asked about options to help distribute the air more evenly throughout the house, and he explained considerations in clear, honest communication.  I like that he detailed the benefits of each option.  Anyway, we decided to go with zone cooling but decided a few days later to cancel because we entered a solar panel agreement with a company that we had been considering for quite some time.  Then the more we thought about it, we think a mini-split would serve our purposes better, and we can find one much cheaper.  (The desert experience is all new to us. ..so our heads have been "swimming" with options.)  Anyway, the Hyde's representative was nice and very understanding when I called to cancel.  (By the way, they wanted $500 for move three ducts, and I ended up getting a handyman to do it for $90.)  I will stick with them for the maintenance but will continue to explore other options.  Very nice people all the way around!<//text>

Greg Defontes repaired our air con unit and as always, he did it in a very efficient and timely manner.  We have used Hydes and Greg to service our heating and air units for the last few years and he has always been excellent in everyway in addition to being totally reliable and trust worthy.  Thank you Greg and Hydes. Cheers, Rich Johnston<//Text>

The service man arrived at the scheduled time. He checked with me to see what the problem was and went straight to work. He figured out what the problem was and got it corrected. Something about wiring shorting out in the new condenser.< /Text>

<Review>We had signed up for the Family Service Plan and had Johnathan come out today to service the AC units and replace filters. Awesome and polite technician. He showed us where all the filters were located, showed us where the attic access was and verified a couple questions we had about a 3rd smaller AC unit. Great company! Want to mention that it's nice to get an email alert when the technician is "in route" to your house. :)< /Review><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

Our technician showed up on time and, masked and gloved.  Very polite and knowledgeable he took right to work inspecting out AC system.  He provided me with a detailed explanation of the service performed and the system is working quietly and trouble free.  We're glad we purchased maintenance with Hydes Air.<//Text>

Called Hyde to come look at our AC Because it shut off a few times during the heatwave. We called a few techs before hyde who all said different things. One even took out the filter and said it was dirty but didn't have a replacement! One said the whole system needed to be replaced. Hyde tech came over fixed the
Unit. Was very professional, knowledgeable,  and fair. We signed up for the yearly maintenance program and that $ goes to an eventual new machine. Thanks hyde!< /text>

Danny Hyde came out today to service our air and heating system (which they installed a few years ago) and, as always was very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable.  He is a pleasure to work with as all of the family are.  We highly recommend Hyde's Air Conditioning.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We have used Hyde's for years and have the utmost trust in their technicians. They arrive on time, are very professional and efficient. They installed a new heating and AC unit for us last year and everything went quickly, smoothly and at a very reasonable price. It's nice to have a local, service business that you can depend on and trust.</Text>

Secured the drain line that came out, buttoned up the cover for the line set with some screws, and put in a strap to hold the drain line in place better.

Using HYDES for over 40 years.  ALWAYS the best in products/service.  totally replaced HVAC this year without a hitch.  They're always on top of the most current in the field, provide options.  Are there at the drop of a hat should we need prompt service.  They're true partners in caring for our midcentury modern home out here in Palm Springs</Text>

Hyde's was timely in arriving, very responsive leading up to the appointment and on time.  Price/value was also very good.  Quality assessment is something that needs "time to tell".  Based on what I saw, however, I'm sure I won't be disappointed with the quality!!<//text>

I had a great experience with Amador.  Super polite and very thorough.
He did a super job and showed up earlier for my appointment as someone else rescheduled.  Great for me.
He took his time to insure my system was in perfect working order.
Summer is coming and I really like to know  that I will have good A/C when needed.  Sincerely, Robin Arlin<//Text>

The most unprofessional and disorganized group of service providers I’ve ever worked with.

We needed TWO Nest thermostats installed, but there was no existing wiring. They told us that they could wiring AND install the thermostats, so we scheduled the service.

And then:
1) The sales rep gave us a quote, but either misspoke or failed to tell us that it was only for one of the thermostats. So the day the tech showed up, they told us the price was double the original quote.

2) the tech realized that one of the thermostats couldn’t be installed the way we asked. So instead of installing one, he left the property without installing either.

3) we finally spoke to the owner, and he said that the quote didn’t include running the wires, which is why we even used them in the first place!!

4) and then he proceeded to tell me that I didn’t understand what I was talking about, and that his sales rep didn’t tell me the wiring was included, as if he knew what was discussed in the call. Instead of owning up to the mistake his sales rep made.

Altogether, I spoke to 4 people in the company. None of them had any idea what was going on, and no one was on the same page.< /Review>

{'time': 1597439481228, 'text': 'Hi Tyler I think the part you are forgetting in your review is about how this is a short term rental that our tech waited at for 30 minutes for the guests to vacate.  The quote you got over the phone was for one thermostat and the tech was sure to explain all the costs before starting any work.  After a lot of wasted time you decided NOT to approve the cost of the work so he left.  I am sorry that this was confusing for you. All of our calls are recorded and everything is noted in the account so I am not sure why you felt that we were not on the same page.  Obviously this is not the type of interaction we work so hard to achieve with our customers so we will take this as a lessons learned for our intital call with you.'}<//Resp>

Exceptional service. Hyde's installed a new a/c system within two days of our old system failing.  They even managed to band aid the old system so our renter was not without a/c in the interim. I would highly recommend Hyde's Air Conditioning.<//Review>

<Review>Hyde's was quick to respond and very professional. Their advice was solid and I am sure they would have done an excellent job. My only criticism is that their bid included items (having to do with the electrical hook-up) that were not necessary since the wiring was already in place. Ultimately we went with another company due to price. In other words, they are a Cadiillac service and we only needed a Chevy...</Review>< Pictures>

Maintenance experience was very good. Technician was very knowledgeable, thorough with the maintenance process and explained, to me, all processes he performed and their status, upon completing the semi-annual (Winter) review.. Also liked the fact that the technician worked in a very clean manner, placing paper “booties” over his shoes upon entering my home…Nice touch.<//text>

I called Hydes because they had rec'd good ratings on the web. My AC had gone out and I needed someone to come out and assess the problem quickly. They set up an appt. for the same day, within 2 hrs of when I called.  Jonathan, the tech, made the assessment and gave me several options for addressing my problem.  Because I was looking for a cost effective option (not the cheapest or the most expensive), we went with an option that should fix the problem, even if not a long term solution. Now, I am waiting for the scheduling of the install.  All-in-all, Hyde was very responsive, arrived on time, and gave me several options with clear explanations for each.< /Text>

i’ve had nothing but issues with almost every company i’ve used for heat and AC—it’s a sketchy industry. These guys came an hour after I called them and fixed the unit in 30 minutes—$320 and the house is already cold an hour later. very professional and easy! highly recommend.<//review>

<text>Hyde's is SO GREAT.  I called them with an emergency and they were there within a couple of hours.  Greg is super knowledgeable and has an awesome work ethic.  he got the job done really efficiently.  really thankful for Greg and Hyde's!  UPDATE: I just had Taylor come to my residence, and he was also AWESOME.  such thorough work, and so capable, carrying on the family tradition like a champ! UPDATE AGAIN!  In the past 2 days I have had Danny come out to inspect an HVAC for a client of mine's condo in Palm Springs, and today I had Casey come over to talk the thru options for installing new HVAC in my home.  I am so THRILLED I use Hyde's.  Every single person has been really really good at their job, and so personable and helpful and honest.  What a relief!   highly recommend.  UPDATE AGAIN -- I just had Jesus and Scott do my new HVAC system and water heater and they were also really awesome (on time, super thorough and careful).  LAST UPDATE:  Casey came back to install a new Nest on my new mini split and he did an awesome job modifying a few things.  Hyde's rocks.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Hydes was very professional and courteous. I needed two ac units installed because I have a two story home. I was told it would be a day and a half job. Two crews showed up and they knocked it out in five hours. I am thrilled at the service. I have used their confort plan for six years now and will continue to use them. Thanks Hydes!< /text>< Pictures>

The heating and air conditioning conversion to the new system went flawlessly and as planned. The task was performed on time and with little disruption for us. The team had a good plan and executed it professionally.
Well done 👍<//text>

Once again Hyde’s came through and fixed my failing AC unit.  Their service technician Jonathan was very courteous and immediately got to work to diagnose the problem.  He determined the problem and fixed it within 20 minutes.  We now have AC again.  Thank you Hyde’s.< /text>

< Review>
A pre-purchase visit with the owner, Barry Hyde, answered all of our questions and got the process started. We understood exactly what we were paying for and what we could expect from the company.
Every employee we encountered was well-trained, from techs to office staff, and they are happy in their jobs, which speaks to the company's treatment of them.
The installers were pleasant, neat, quiet, and efficient. We were not without cool air long enough to have to leave the house.
Follow-up issues have been handled promptly and satisfactorily, and we are confident that responsiveness will continue.
We would recommend this family-owned, highly experienced company without reservation.< /Review>

<Text>The noise or rumble as I described it, was a piece of installation that fell from the inside of the unit; and was rubbing against the blower.
He did a great job, very polite, and consous of covid 19 virus; wearing mask and footies. I said I would do the clean up from his trip out of the attic.  very pleases on a whole.< /Text>< GmapID>

Jeff is a great technician with Hyde Air-conditioning. He was fast and efficient! Our AC stopped working and they were out to the house, had it fixed and working within an hour! Very happy and will continue to use them for all of  my air conditioning needs!<//text>

I’ve been using Hyde’s for a couple of years after  being dissatisfied with one of their competitors.
My perception of why I’ve been so happy with Hyde’s is that everyone I’ve interacted with in their organization takes pride in what they do and each has taken ownership in providing great customer service.< /text>

My compliments to Michael Hydes Son Danny, he is very professional but also extremely polite, there was a situation that none of had the answer until Danny came back today and found that the power was off and all he did was pull the plug next to the furnace and put the plug back in and the power came back on so the AC came back on.
My thanks to Danny for coming back and resolving the problem.
Hyde's has always been dependable, I am that is why I have been a customer for the past 25 years.
We had an issue last evening where both AC were not working ( 9-24-2020 ) and your repairman Casey
came out ( we were not home at time so do not know exactly what he did but got the AC's working again until this evening, they went out again at about 5:00PM so I called and was told someone will be here tomorrow between 8 and 10.00 AM.
A new AC unit was just installed May 2020 and the other unit was checked in July this year.
I believe when your installer did the new unit he switched the wiring around so the existing unit that was servicing the rear part of the house got switched to the front of the house. there may be some issues there, I hope they can be resolved. I do not know why that was done, you will have to ask whoever did the installation.
Not a good time to be without a/c.
Look forward to getting these issues resolved soon!!

This morning We were not happy with  whoever covered the clothes in the closet before they did the installation. When I pulled clothes this morning they were dirty. They did not cover from the wall  he only covered the front half of the clothes from the shelf but the shelf was a wire rack and all kinds of debris fell through. So there was a lot of dirt and debris on the back half of the hanging clothes.

The installers were efficient and got everything accomplished in a timeley manner.</text>

We are part of their family plan, a few weeks back on the hottest day of the year, our a/c was blowing hot air. They came out at 8:30pm no hesitation, an hour later all was fixed and running like new. They are our goto team, we are very fortunate too be a part of the Hyde's family plan. Every service tech is knowledgeable and professional, they make you feel it's about you. They are definitely service oriented</Review>

<review>We (my daughter Susan and I) think that Hyde's is one of the best-run companies we have seen in many years.  Your technicians are polite, considerate, highly-skilled, knowledgeable; it is reassuring that they are backed up by a family that takes pride in their employees and gives them what they need to help the customers.   A fleet of trucks, parts on hand, responsive customer service.  Not a "fly-by-night"operation by any means!  When you have something that can become so expensive and yet we cannot do without in our hot weather, it has been good for us that we know about Hyde's.  Most recently Greg DeFontes was our technician (he was here in 2019 as well); he is very nice as are all of your people - just the best!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Professional and exceptionally knowledgeable. Contacted Hyde’s about replacing HVAC unit and improving airflow in my home. Spent the time to understand the problem and develop a sound solution. Installation staff was courteous, efficient and executed the installation to perfection.

<review>Installation was halted tiday until proper equipment is confirned.

5/6/20  equipment was installer today.  A professionalità, clean non.

5/15/20  condensation from the installed air conditioner was leaking in my garage.  The technicians returned to address the leak.  They left, thinking they had fixed the leak.  Subsequently, the leak continued in the same place.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dafbeb644242cd:0xd3a7f71b45fcdc4<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We scheduled maintenance for our 10 year old AC system with Hydes' Air conditioning after doing our due diligence research for a reputable company. Hyde's showed up on time for the appointment and performed the service.  During the maintenance a restriction was indicated in the system.  A salesman came and gave us three options to address our system issue.  We elected to have a new coil and condenser installed.  Hyde's installation showed up on the appointment date on time and professionally worked to install our new American Standard system within four hours.  I highly recommend Hyde's for their  professional service and value.  I did due diligence research on AC systems and American Standard is recommended by Consumer Reports.  We are very pleased with the service and value received. Thank you Jesus and Scott for the excellent quality installation and testing of our system and cleanliness.  Thank you Danny for the excellent maintenance service and Mike for the three options on our system allowing us to select the best to fit our needs.< /Review>< Pictures>

It is not often that you do business with a Company that exhibits a culture of Customer Satisfaction across the board.  I had a mini-split AC system installed in my garage and it was executed in 4 hours (arrived on time, completed on time).  Over the entire process I dealt with 6 employees of Hyde's AC and all made me feel that my satisfaction was paramount to them.  Now, Hyde's is My AC company.

Seasonal service today 5/23, This company is awesome.

7/14/20 service today was exceptional.  These people hold themselves to a higher standard!</text>

The technician was on time and seemed pleasant. I liked the detail of wearing protective paper booties over his shoes. At first, I thought it was nice that he asked for a broom to clean up the mess of lint and dust he made in my hallway although perhaps that's something he should carry with him. It took me awhile to find my dustpan and broom and when I finally did he'd already picked it up by hand and tossed it on my front patio. That was weird and unprofessional. He could have asked to throw it in the trash. I had to pick it up from my patio.

As for the work, it was a summer service only. He said everything checked out good except we were low on freon which meant we have a leak. He said we need to pay for a $385 leak check. That's a bit expensive so we said we'd reach out to our home warranty insurance company. He said ok and that the leak was all that needed to be done. Once he left and provided the inspection report, we saw it says there is something called a superheat which came up as "Red- requires attention/failed". I don't know what this is and if it's a problem. The word failed insinuates a problem, but because he didn't mention it I just don't know.

Overall, we joined their maintenance plan today with this service and I'm thinking maybe it wasn't a good idea. We will see.

Well fast forward to May 21st and my warranty company inspected my unit and says there is no sign of a leak, freon levels are normal and unit is functioning well. That was an unnecessary $80 copay but at least I didn't pay Hyde's $385. Not happy. Will cancel service plan after fall inspection.

Nov 16. Just had fall inspection.  Technician was nice.  Good experience.  Happy with service today.  I've increased my stars to 3 based on today's experience.  I like having someone come out and service the equipment but the first technician in the spring kind of put me off.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Casey came over to give pricing for a new system.  He checked the old one first to make sure it wasn't something small. I appreciate that. He checked all system parts, including the attic. He then gave us specific pricing choices and made suggestions for our house.  Told me exactly what would be included in the job, and what wouldn't be.  Both appreciated.  Told us about special pricing options and financing options.  All in all, we accomplished our goal.  Now the discussion begins. 😀😀<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Chris identified the problem quickly and replaced the old, shorting breakers with new ones on the spot. Afterwards the initial problem (non-working fridge electrical outlet) was still not solved. More investigation and the loose wire was detected. Promptly repaired and problem solved. All done with a smile. We received the call ahead making it easy to prepare for Chris' arrival. We called in the morning hoping to get service that day, and indeed we did. All in all very pleased.<//Text><user>114011728941902923075</user><rating>5< /rating><Gmap_id>0x80dafbeb644242cd:0xd3a7f71b45fcdc4<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Unfortunately, not a good experience.  Started with poor follow through.  A tech came out very quickly and diagnosed the problem.  I was to get a call back next day to schedule a time for repair.  Still No call back.  I then called at 4pm to follow up and the part had to be ordered.  Tech came out two days later and the part wasn’t correct.  Had to re-order.  Then got my bill and it was $150 more than what I was quoted plus they charged me twice for the $85 service fee in addition to me writing a check on the first visit.  Not impressed and having a contract with them didn’t seem to help.  Customer service and techs were courteous.</Text><rate>1<//rate>< userid>

Had a summer air conditioning service visit by technician Taylor, July 8th.  He was very knowledgeable and shared with me each step and why he was doing what he was doing ... service visits are educational for me.  He made a recommendation that will make my unit run more efficient and lengthen it's life.  I always enjoy visits from the Hyde Family business.</review>

The A/C on my vacation rental stopped working while I had guests staying over. This particular day the temperature outside was 120 degrees. When I called Hyde’s with this emergency they sent James one of their technicians right away and the problem was fixed is less than 30 minutes. Hyde’s A/C is the company to call when you need you A/C repaired.< /text>

I have been a loyal customer for sixteen years and have always been satisfied with their service.  However, at the moment I am not pleased with the service techs that arrived this morning to install a new A/C system. At about 11:30 am  we were told they were finished with the install and were just doing cleanup.  So we told them we were going to check out of our hotel.  When we returned at 12:30 pm,  the techs were gone and the house was at 91 degrees.  No phone call, no text, to advise us of any difficulties so that we would not check out of our hotel room.  Now it’s 2 pm, another tech arrived after our frantic call to the office, and is checking why the system doesn’t work.   It’s a holiday weekend and hotel rooms are difficult to find here in the desert, and if this isn’t solved by the end of the day, we will have to wait til next Tuesday to get resolution.  Not sure where we can go.

UPDATE AS  OF 4 PM:  The new tech was able to troubleshoot the problem.  It was caused by our remote Honeywell thermostat.  He removed it and put a generic thermostat in and the system works fine.  I did leave my review with 5 stars because we really appreciated the quick response time to our original call for help.</Text>

Michael Hyde came and measured the air pressure differentials across the furnace and the ducts and found the  return air was insufficient, so we added a return duct and modified another. Once the system was installed he came back to ensure we had achieved the modification to ensure we could make maximum efficiency. The American Standard units installed are rated No 1 by Consumer Reports so we have a reliable system that is very efficient.. Great service by a family run business.</text>

<text>We moved into a home without AC in April 2017.  It was unseasonably warm and my husband was experiencing chronic heart problems.  We moved from Chicago where it was 40 degrees to the desert where it was 107.  Despite it being peak season, they kept us in mind for earlier installation which we very much appreciated.  Chris, the sales person we met with was extremely professional, knowlegable and helpful.  He explained multiple options and the benefits of each.  He explained that the unit we were most interested in was able to access parts locally, in the event that we needed service.  We have not needed service however we appreciated knowing that if we do, the parts should be readily available which is a comfort.  Hyde’s also installed AC into our 55 and over community’s clubhouse.  Everyone raves about how well it works!  We purchased 2 split units, one for our bedroom and one for our living space- they work incredibly well in cooling our home quickly, efficiently and for an affordable price.  The technicians who installed our system were also very professional.  We love our system and Hyde’s so much that we suggest it to everyone we know looking for new AC.  We even invite new neighbors over to demonstrate how our units work!!!< /text>< Pictures>

Called for service on a AC unit, service tech said there was a restriction in the system and he could not fix it, said I needed to spend $7,200 on as new unit. I then call Barry Hyde, he agreed with the service tech. So I called another company and they came out and fixed the unit by replacing a part. Cost was $ 400.00. Unit is working great. I'm not happy with Hyde's .  Milo Holte< /review>

I had a new, full HVAC system installed in this oppressive desert heat, and now I am living the cool life. The Hyde's team was efficient and thorough. I particularly was impressed by the follow-up visit to explain the system, its warranty and to tweak a problem with my smart thermostat and the new two-stage system. I felt in good hands with Hyde's.</Text>

<text>The entire Hyde's Team is extraordinary!  From sales, through administration to the field techs!!  Thank you all!!

Just had another experience with Hyde's...they NEVER disappoint.  Greg came to service my mini-split system. Attentive to my home (he had mask, booties and gloves)...and exhibiting expertise answered my questions.  Hyde's truly takes the extra time to insure all is well and the units/equipment are working at optimum.

<Review>James is efficient, professional and knowledgeable.
My dog likes him too!

Chris Schultz is just exceptional.  That would be the word that characterizes this company and its employees!! Thank you, Chris!

When Johnny arrived he was immediately professional, yet displaying warmth.  He went above and beyond in customer care and job well done.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>First class service from first inquiry to completion. Everyone in this organization is top notch. Lisa at the administration desk is courteous, knowledgeable, very responsive and professional. To the technicians Frank and Jesus and everyone else on the job servicing, replacing and installation of my new a/c. This is an extremely busy time for all a/c servicing and installation businesses in the area and Hyde completed the job within 3 days. We called for service Tuesday, Technician assessed the problem Wednesday and a new unit was installed Thursday. I signed annual servicing contracts for my other properties right away - first year servicing for my new unit was free. I highly recommend Hyde's Air Conditioning. My advice, don't even shop for price comparisons, you get what you pay for and the service Hyde's A/C provides is priceless<//review>< Pictures>

Hyde's Air Conditioning installed the AC unit in the home my wife and I purchased in December.  It was a natural for us to choose Hyde's to service our unit since they had installed it, at least for this first time.  We will definitely choose Hyde's again when its time for the next service.  I was impressed from the initial phone call when setting up the appointment with Janelle in the office.  She was helpful, friendly and accommodating.  We received a reminder email of our appointment the day before, and another email to notify us that the technician, Jonathan, was on his way.  Jonathan arrived when promised, was thorough and helpful and possessed a lot of knowledge about our AC system.  He went above the call of duty by reinstalling a vent cover I had had difficulty with and offered insight about increasing airflow in the upstairs bedroom.  I was very pleased and impressed with Hyde's quality of customer service and will most certainly call on them from here on in as my AC service company of choice.   Thank you!</text>

Hyde A/C repair provides unmatched customer service. The few times we have used them they have been consistent in ensuring all expectations are exceeded. Repair techs are always friendly and efficient. Our tech, Johnathon, was here maybe 20 minutes and the job was complete. He took the time to explain the issue and what it would take to repair. So, now my 95 degree house will be comfortable soon!  You probably pay a little more with these guys but it's worth it. Out here in the desert you want to make sure it's fixed right the first time!  Highly recommended.< /Review>

Yes, yes, yes, don't hesitate to select Hydes. From start to finish professional high quality reasonably priced local business with long time roots in the valley. They were so good I almost want to keep them to myself. But to be fair to Mike and his team I have to shout about this outstanding family owned business. I've had the rest Hyde's is the best. #6 STARS!
High praise to Joe, Frank, Lisa, Juan, and Danny.< /Review>

<Text>We tried installing wifi thermostats and couldn't get power to the thermostats. Thought we shorted something out and had a different local A/C company come out and they told me my main furnace board needed replaced. They ordered a new board and then installed it and found out it wasn't the board that was bad. They had 3 service techs here and spent an hour trying to find the Zone Control Board figuring the problem had to be there. They finally gave up and told me to call another company. I was referred to Hyde and called them. The sent Chris, their service tech out and immediately I knew I was in good hands. Chris was very professional as well as very personable. Chris found the problem and Zone Control Board in 15 MINUTES when the 3 other guys couldn't find it after looking for almost an hour. Chris correctly wired the Zone Board and we were up and running. Hyde A/C is awesome and I highly recommend them.

Hyde’s replaced my entire HVAC system. The management and customer service couldn’t have been better. The installation team consisted of two of the nicest young men I have encountered in a very long time. They were completely respectful of my property, and answered all of my questions.

This was a tough job for Greg, I'm sure, having to work on a 41-year-old blower fan, but he handled it with true professionalism and skill. I couldn't have wished for a more competent person to solve my A/C problem.  Kudos to Hyde's for having Greg on their team!</review>

< Review>
Casey did a great job. We were having problems with our thermostat. It would go into a reset mode if we touched it to adjust the temp, etc., flicker and then eventually reset itself, but by the next time we walked by, it was going through this reboot process again. At first Casey thought it might be a loose connection and attempted to fix that problem, but after he left, we checked and it was still having problems. We called back to Hyde's and Casey came out and installed a new thermostat. It works great. We had quick response and follow through until the problem was resolved.<//Review>

Jeff is thorough, very knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with. He not only identified a problem with our A/C disconnect box but was also able to repair it while he was here, which was really convenient. I’m impressed with Hyde’s overall professionalism, and especially with their embrace of technology. I got both a text and an email the day before our appointment, I received an email - with Jeff’s photo - when he was on his way and I was given a link to a map which provided me with his truck’s real-time location. I unhesitatingly recommend Hyde’s for any of your HVAC needs, and since they also do electrical work, I’ll be contacting them for several projects and some maintenance.<//Review>< pics>

Everyone at Hyde's has been really great to work with and very professional ! Your electric Dept. gave us an estimate to fix the exhaust fan in our bathroom and we thought the estimate was to high for us. So we purchased the parts, and had our handyman install them for half the price. We are retired and keep a close eye on our expenses. Our experience with your heating and air conditioning yearly services in years past have been excellent.</review>

< Review>
Quick, personable, and informative. Trustworthy.  I had to call them when I realized my AC was failing (on a 120 degree day).  They came out four hours later, presented my options to me, and didn't pressure me for an immediate decision.  After interviewing two other companies and asking a lot of questions, I went with Hyde's .  Why?  They had the best prices, the best warranty, and the best reputation.  They even came out and added refrigerant to my AC Unit so my home would stay cool until they did the work a couple of days later.<//Review>

Greg, as scheduled arrived at the designated time to service our 4 separate Heating units to get them ready for use during the winter season at our home in  La Quinta, Ca. The service he provided was OUTSTANDING.
He is experienced, personable and explained all that he was to do and accomplish. Whenever I need service from Hydes Heatng and Airconditioning Co. I always request Greg for service. I am requesting that this company reward Greg with a BIG Thank You and a "Holiday" Bonus. You are the Best and Deserve the Very Best!!!</review>

We purchased 2 A/C units from Hyde's. Every interaction we have had with them from installation to our twice yearly maintenance visits have great. They are on time, professional, knowledgeable, friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. We really enjoy dealing with a family owned company. Danny, our tech, was polite, took time to answer all our questions and explained everything he had checked out on the roof. We would definitely recommend them to our friends.</review>

Our Hyde's service was smooth and efficient.  Both of the techs were friendly and courteous.  They gave a clear explanation of the results of their testing.  We are very satisfied.

Chris Schultz was our technician today.  He is very professional, very personable, and represents Hyde's quite well.  He was thorough and efficient.  We are very satisfied with his service.< /text>

Daniel was excellent, on time, friendly and he explained everything thoroughly. It is great to do business with such an outstanding company.

Jonathan Ruiz was just here and did an excellent job.  He showed me where all the gas lines were and was extremely helpful.

Another great service call performed by Taylor. Hydes Air Conditioning team is the very best!<//review>

Thor, didn't bring his hammer but he did bring all the right tools and knowledge. This is the second time Thor has been my service technician and I have not been disappointed. He is very thorough and will take the time to explain anything I ask about. I like this guy a lot. But I have have also had three other techs from Hyde's that I was happy with their service.< /review>

Did the install today. They were very courteous, cleaned everything up perfectly, made sure we understand how to use the system, and we couldn’t be happier with the experience.</text>

<Text>We started with this company and they have been good so far, except our last service call. We called them due to a non working brand new unit in our garage. We received a confirm that it had a leak, hence not working. The service fellow (who came out the next day, so quick service)said he couldn't find the leak and just filled it with solution (new freeon) and this time next year, he says, we can get two fellows to come out and find the leak!  Next year? This is a brand new unit, you would think he would have called for backup and gotten the leak solved now!  We will be calling and speaking to someone regarding this situation.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Hyde's was responsive to our A/C issues, always within their promised time frame.  I had them install my new HVAC system eight years ago, and have been pleased with their ongoing maintenance.
I have found their annual service agreement program to be very cost effective.
All of their technicians are knowledgeable and courteous and provide detail about their visit.< /Text>

UPDATE: We called Hyde as soon as we we got to the area and Mike came over the next day to finalize our options. Again, he was totally thorough and thoughtful about what we needed and what would work best. We chose a Daiken system and the installers arrived just 2 days later. It required electrical work and that was done first, then the installation. Because we went with a dual system it took slightly longer than a day but the crew was fantastic - fast, efficient, tidy and very professional. One unit had a defective part and a technician arrived the next day to replace it. We were very pleased with all of our dealings with Hyde and highly recommend them!

EARLIER: Even though he knew we will not be installing a new cooling system until fall, Micheal spend over an hour with us discussing our options, reviewing different possible plans and products and explaining the work that had to be done beforehand. He was thorough and clear and that helped us make the decision about what type of system to install. We were very impressed and pleased. Looking forward to working with this company for your new system in the fall.< /review>

We are very pleased with everything. The tech was very professional, friendly, and kept us informed on progress. The service was provided as scheduled and was completed as scheduled. We made several calls to friends to ask whom they would recommend. They all recommended Hydes. We will do the same. Thank you all for getting us back up under air.

I have been satisfied with Hyde's from the beginning of my experience with the company. Very nice employees,clean, nest, polite. In the past have asked questions and have gotten.satisfactory answers. Never a problem with scheduling plus they are here on time unless there is an emergency. This happened once I believe but not a long waiit.
Very impressed with the Hyde's Co.</Text>

Casey is a professional, informed and excellent communicator about the very complicated Air Conditioning business.  We need 3 units replaced and received information from 4 other businesses before we finally felt comfortable selecting Hyde Air Conditioning.  We give Casey and team 5/5!  Kirsten and office staff as well as Adrian and installation team were professional and helpful.  What a relief to trust Hydes as Our Air Conditioning company going forward too.  Thanks!! (;</Review>

<Text>They were lifesavers - through my senior stupidity, I had blown a fuse - it wasn't an emergency, but I called and made an appointment for the following day, but the more I Thought about it (senior apprehension - I visualized tearing out the walls to get the problem).
However Chris arrived today and diagnosed the problem - the breaker had to be replaced. It has made my day!

Greg from Hydes came out to do our normal before summer check up and noticed that the new thermostat that I had installed according to what the manufacturer of the thermostat said, was not hooked up right. He fixed it and then completed our service in a timely manner and great attitude. His expertise was greatly appreciated and made out experience a great one. The only reason I gave 4 stars was the guy before Greg did not notice this and said nothing about the thermostat not being hooked up right and also he said nothing about how only 1 of the 2 stages of our ac unit was being used because of the incorrectly hooked up thermostat. All well in the end though.</Review>

Very efficient,  good communication & follow-up between all Hyde personel.  Family owned & quoted fair price. Highly confident with their work & will definitely use them again without hesitation.</Text>

I was having a problem with my air conditioning. Michael Hyde came out and diagnosed the problem. He said that he would research the problem and get back to me with an answer. He was very professional and did a quick fix to get the air conditioner running again until he can ascertain the solution. I really appreciated his concern for our comfort.

Greg came out today to address a problem with my heating. He called in advance and said while he was on the roof, he would shut the gate so I could let my dogs out if needed. I find Greg to be very professional.  He asks pointed questions to make sure that we were happy with the HVAC they installed. I would not hesitate in recommending this company.</review>

<review>Best HVAC experience ever!

I called Hyde’s looking for a quote to replace an ancient package unit. They were able to send a technician (owner) within the hour and after an honest discussion, we agreed on a unit and thought the price was fair. The unexpected and unbelievable part is that Hyde’s was able to install the unit the NEXT morning, before our family came home fore the weekend with temperatures expected to be in the 100s. The day of the installation, the technicians arrived on time and within several hours had the old unit off the roof (with a crane) and the new one installed and connected to our thermostat. Throughout the process, everyone at the office and in the field was more than professional and very friendly. Communication was on point too. Hyde’s truly saved the day and I would highly recommend them for all your HVAC needs.</review><Response>None</Response>< rate>

We just arrived to our home in La Quinta to find out our A/C was not working. House temp was 100 degrees. We searched yelp and called several places. Most didn’t answer phone or weren’t available until next week! Got a hold of Hyde and they were able to send someone out within 2 hours. Frank was excellent! Fixed A/C and we are also signed up for maintenance twice yearly. A lifesaver!</review>

Great service, from the time I called to the time they were finished with the job.  They troubleshooted the issue and repaired it within minutes.  Also had a system tune-up.  They are reasonably priced and perform the best service.  And Frank the technician was the BEST!< /Text>

As always, Hyde comes through and solves the problem! Thank you Greg for getting more air to my bedroom and bathroom! Even though our house was not built correctly and the wrong vents were installed, Greg still managed to make things better. As always, Hyde saves the day! They’re the best and that’s that!<//text>

Steve was great -- friendly, informative, & respectful.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was due to the 30 min. notification call that Hydes said they would give.  There was no tel. call; instead, they sent an email, which I was not looking for; therefore, did not see it.  Joanne<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Bought a place in Palm Desert with a 2yo 4 ton American Standard AC.  Called Hyde's a çouple weeks ago to see if I could transfer the warranty to me, the new owner.  I could and I did. I then arranged for annual service #1 and it was the owner's son that showed up.  I was impressed with his knowledge and professionalism.

Also they just added electrical services to the company so having a few things (new circuit breakers and a couple new dedicated circuits) And yes, I feel very comfortable with giving this family-owned business 5 stars.

4/14/20 Update
Hyde's remains our go to sevice on our AC/Heater.  Maintenance runs like clock work.  Couldn't be happier.  5 star remains.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Thinking the worst and hearing the worst was very alarming however the services provided by Hydes and their excellent repairman, Frank, made the experience a positive rather than a negative.  Frank's ability to diagnosis and explain the diagnosis to us was exceptional as was the communication and flexibility of the administration.  We are beyond impressed, will use their services from now on, and certainly recommend them to all we know! Thank you Hydes!<//text>< pics>

<text>We have had our air conditioning and heating serviced by Hydes for the last 8 years and have been very happy with their service. Today, their service rep, Steve Martin, came to our home as our bedroom a/c unit was not preforming properly. Steve diagnosed the issue quickly and took the time to explain in layman terms what was causing the problem. He explained our options to fix the system and helped us reach an educated decision to the best solution for our system. I really appreciated the time and education he provided on the service call today and he fixed our problem in a short amount of time and now we are enjoying the system working properly again.</text></record>

I contacted Hyde's Air Conditioning (as well as 2 other companies) to see if it would be feasible to replace a 12 year old 2 ton AC system that was slowly leaking refrigerant and needed to be repaired or replaced. Barry Hyde came to the house the next day, reviewed our entire existing HVAC solutions. He subsequently made recommendations, gave us proposals,  answered all our concerns and  gave us the space necessary to adequately evaluate the equipment and pricing proposals and make decisions that were best for our family. The American Standard Platinum variable speed product line was installed 2 days ago. The crew was very professional and efficient. The equipment operates exactly as promised, quiet, efficient and very effective. We can barely tell the system is on while it maintains the exact set temperature. This has been the perfect experience so far and I highly recommend both American Standard and Hyde's AC as the sales, customer service, installation and equipment repair company. Thank you for your help, fairness and service. I look forward to doing the next portion of the project asap.

Thanks to Gregg DeFontes for the quality service on our four air conditioners this week.  All checked out, refrigerant fluid topped up, coils cleaned and two marginal condensers replaced and we are good to go for the summer.  Appreciated the care, the explanations and advice re options.  Please send Gregg the next time we call.  He is a gem!</Review>

Hydes has been reliable over the years and has great customer service. I have participated in their preventative maintenence program after my AC/Heater unit was installed almost 10 years ago. They honored my warrantly recently and fixed a small leak in the system for free. Grateful for this honest and reliable service!<//Review>

Tremendous service!  We arrived in the desert to find our AC was out.  It was 113 outside.  Hydes sent someone out that day to help.  Chris did all he could, but determined it was time for a replacement.  He was so professional and kind and truly cared about us!  Our new go to company!<//Review>

<Review>The owner came out and spent a good amount of time going through all the details of the A/C systems and the ones he sells and installs.  He is very friendly and knowledgable about A/C and heating, among other things.

I admit to a little bit of sticker shock, but I am sure that the quality of product and service will be top notch.</Review><user_id>109443109766202961112<//user_id><date>1532460474001< /date></record>

Chris Schultz was the Hydes Technician sent to our home for our semi-annual service on Jul 10, 18.  His confidence and knowledge reassured our trust in your company.  He did an excellent job for us and we enjoyed his friendliness and personality.</text>

<review>Greg was very friendly. He kept me informed every step of the way on his findings. Once the problem was discovered, he explained thoroughly the problem and the solution. He was very respectful of my home and applied shoe booties before being asked to. Part 2:  Installation of new parts to follow.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Hydes Air Conditioning is a wonderful company. We're on their regular maintenance program and they keep our AC and heater in tiptop shape.
Taylor was our technician yesterday, he went above and beyond the call of duty by climbing up and down the ladder multiple times to readjust our vents to my liking. He was cheerful and informative and took the time to explain why some of our rooms were warmer than others.
I would highly recommend the company to anyone who is looking for reliable, professional AC/Heating services.<//text>

We purchased our ac unit with Hyde's around 5 years ago and have participated in their ongoing maintenance plan and we have been exceedingly impressed with their customer service and the security we feel with knowing that we are well taken care of in the hottest months of the year and throughout, here in the desert!
Thank You Hyde's!< /Review>

Our technician was kind and on time after we had yo reschedule twice (calls ran over on the previously scheduled days). When the tech came out,  I pointed our concerns out to him,  he wrote up a quote and asked me for the $85 diagnostic fee.  I wrote him a check,  then later that evening,  when my husband came home,  he asked what the diagnosis was and how they were planning to fix it. I didn't have an answer... I never actually received a diagnosis and did not know what the issue's were.  I promptly called the office,  where they then explained that I would have to speak with the tech again because the indi was not in his notes either. It was not a great first- time experience addend we will not be recommending Hyde's to friends and family.</text>

<text>I had water coming out of my ceiling and my immediate thought was....here we go. An AC company will come out and say I need a new evaporator and a big expensive bill will follow. Casey from Hydes Air Conditioning came out, diagnosed the problem, cut out and repaired seriously clogged out a condensate line and gave recommendations that I took. Casey and Hydes is a company that I would recommend to everyone. They are honest, prompt, keep you informed and professional. Most importantly, they could have easily told me I need a whole new system or at least an evaporator for thousands and I wouldn't be the wiser. Many companies would do exactly that and I thank Casey and Hydes for their honesty. I will recommend them to any homeowner that needs AC service.<//text>< pics>

Casey is always prompt and efficient. He does a very nice job.  He also reminded us of the age of our equipment and suggested we think about replacements in the future.  Nobody ever touches our heating and air conditioning systems but Hyde's.  Have enjoyed working with them for more than 14 years.</Text>

Casey showed up on time and after an inspection clearly explained the remedy. His price was quite a bit less than General's for the equal product.  Very happy with his representation. will recommend to others if the ugly realty of a kaput compressor hits them.</Text>

Have been using this company for 17 years and are very happy with everything they do- they just seem to get better all the time.  I have recommended them to at least 10 different people and so far have not heard one complaint .  Great family owned company< /Review>

<user_name>Roslyn Markman</user_name><Text>Frank showed up as scheduled and was very professional. He was very careful as he serviced my a/c.
I really liked that Hyde's sent me an email on the technician who was coming to my home and the time he would be there.
The reason I gave Hyde's 4 stars is because the check off form that has been used in the past was no longer used. The form gave me all the details of the service and condition of my a/c.
Other than that, I would still highly recommend Hydes for a/c and heating service.<//Text>< Response>

<Response>None</Response><text>My parents used Hyde for years. Not sure if it's under new ownership, but we recently had a couple very unpleasant experiences with them. Came to our Mom's house in the spring to fix an air conditioner. Gave her an estimate of $5500. Luckily, my brother was there & called me. I told him to call another service I used that had saved me a lot of money. He came over & repaired the problem for $280 & it's been fine ever since. Even in the extreme summer heat. My brother called Hyde & they were extremely rude. Said they have been to our Mom's house several times cause the unit would blow a fuse. Completely untrue. They did the maintenance on her HVAC twice a year. Never again. Also, when I sold my Palm Desert condo the unit they installed did not pass the home inspection because of the wrong number of amps being put in. A shame long term customers are treated this way. Now ex-customers.</text>< UserId.>

Amazing customer service and better help.  Our AC went out and he fixed it within the week.  Really, really happy with their customer service and attention to detail  Will definitely use again and suggest to friends in the dessert!  *** Also, got a quote from another company and it was really bad.  They did a minimum/good/best option and did not fully disclose everything.  These guys were honest and great!< /Review>

Excellent service.  I called on Saturday, desperate, as my air conditioner went out and it got up to 88 degrees in my house.  I expected to either have to wait for several hours and I was even prepared for next day service since it was late Saturday evening. Much to my surprise, the technician was at my home within 20 minutes of calling and my A/C was back working in another 20 minutes!   I highly recommend them. Great service!<//review>

This morning my AC quit working. I immediately call Hydes because of my confidence in their work from past experience with them. Their quick response time, notification of when their service technician is on the way, and even online tracking of the tech's location is amazing. The reality is sooner or later everyone in the Valley has a problem with their AC. Hydes should be your first call.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>jesus, your technician was very pleasant to work with; he was delightful and extremely knowledgeable, and has been to my home on another occasion. He did a masterful job yet again! And, again! Hyde’s is the best most HONEST air conditioning service in the valley!

Jonathan was very personable, kept me apprised of the a.c. Issues, and will return to complete the problem. Highly recommend.<//Text>< Pictures>

Frank was professional, courteous, on-time, and well-groomed.  He explained what he was doing and explained the reason why I needed a surge protector installed.  He didn't leave any mess in the work area either.</Review>

Nothing but the best.  Casey carefully and completely explained my options when I was preparing to replace my a/c.  The two women, Christine and Kirstie, were courteous and helpful.  The two installers were outstanding.  It is so nice to have excellent, courteous and and efficient service.  I have traded with Hyde's many, many years and have never been disappointed.</review>

HVAC System Installation completed in thorough and professional manner.  The Company's philosophy is clearly "Get it Right", not just "get it in".  When they were done with the job, you knew that it was a solid work-product.  We also appreciated knowing that our installation would go through an additional review, just to make certain it's done right.  If you're comparing HVAC systems and service providers - don't lose sight of the labor portion of those warranties.  Hyde's A/C stands behind the products they sell, and their work.  It's been a great experience so far.  Thanks!<//Text>

<Text>We had such a pleasant experience with Hyde's. Greg D. was our technician and was very upfront and honest with what he was doing with our system and with suggestions as to what he thought were things we needed to take care of right away or things that could be put on hold. One of the things that my husband noticed was Greg putting shoe covers on before he entered our house. That was honestly something that stood out to my husband and he found it to be respectful of our house as well. My husband also appreciated the way that Greg explained everything to him that he was doing and definitely seemed like an expert in his field. We signed up for a service contract that day, and are looking forward to seeing Greg again for our future services!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

James came out the same day we called.  It was an emergency and we really appreciated the same day service.  He worked very diligently on both of our air conditioners.  One unit he was able to fix, the other, unfortunately had some extra issues that he was not able to complete.  I will finish my review after he comes back with his supervisor to determine the answers to our problem! However my husband and I were very impressed with James cleanliness and expertise.< /text>

Casey was amazing! Warm friendly, However this time Hydes wanted to over Charge me for simply charging me for a job  that the service tech was at my house for less than 30 min...which the service tech took off my panels and let the coils defrost told me what the issue was and left!  I feel the charges wasn't really fair...I'll definitely be looking for a new A/C company<//Review>

<Text>Jeff Sproul is, in my opinion, "A technician's technician."  That means he is the Tech anyone should want when their A/C system fails.

Jeff is an apex troubleshooter and knows his job inside and out. After he finishes, the customer can note the many small but important things he takes care of when servicing or repairing the A/C, like ensuring it is exactly the way the customer wants it set, the clock is accurate, etc.

Jeff tests everything before he departs and always tells the customer what is going on so they are not in the dark.

He answers all questions fully and in a way the average person can comprehend.

Hyde's definitely is Number One in my book for A/C and heating services, and Jeff Sproul, Taylor Hyde, and the other professional and knowledgeable technicians at Hyde's are a huge part of it.

Thank you, Hyde's, for keeping us cool in Summer and warm in Winter; you're much appreciated!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dafbeb644242cd:0xd3a7f71b45fcdc4<//Gmap_id></record>

We were out of the country when our air conditioner decided to quit and we had house guests staying during triple digits.  They put our needs on a fast track and got the job done quickly.  Hydes could not have been more pleasant or professional from beginning to end.  Our guests thank you and we thank you and you can bet we will be giving you references whenever we can.

Always honest, polite and informative.
I have never had a bad experience with Hyde Air Conditioning and Heating.
Greg came out at 10:00 PM last night.  Our system had shut down.  After a few phone calls to Mike Hyde and some input from myself about what was taking place he was able to diagnose the problem to a blocked drain line causing the auto drain line shut off valve to turn the system off.
Greg was patient, he listened to me and he solved the problem.  Slept in air conditioned comfort last night.  This is a company that really cares about their customers.  Thank you for the excellent service.</Text>

Came home from traveling 20 days and my house was 101 inside.  Batteries had died on thermostat control which caused A/C not to kick on.  Called Hyde A/C immediately and the woman answering the phone could not of been nicer.  I got scheduled for service right away with Steve.  He arrived when they said he would and fixed the problem quickly with a new air compactor.  Will most definitely schedule a yearly maintenance service with them.< /text>

<Review>Steve was on-time and explained what he was doing along the way.  He made suggestions on energy conservation and about our old a/c unit that needs replacement, but wasn't overly pushy.  Their billing/invoicing process is also high-tech--it's paperless and involves an iPad instead of signing paper contracts!  Thanks.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dafbeb644242cd:0xd3a7f71b45fcdc4<//gmap_id></record>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Service on our A/C System.
We had our system installed by Hydes in 2015, and it has been working well, I like the notification by e-mail and text that Hydes gives for the Service Call, they even tell you the technicians name. The technician was very polite and put shoe covers on before he entered the house, he asked how the system was working, it had not been as efficient recently, and I was hoping the service would correct this.
He carried out the service, changed the filters, ran a diagnostic check on the main panel and cleaned the outside unit. He said he could not find anything significant that would have reduced the performance of the system and asked that we keep an eye on it and if it was still not working properly then to make a service call.
Technician was clean/polite and efficient, the only reason that I did not give 5 stars was that after the diagnostic check, it had stopped the wireless part of the system working, so I had to reboot the panel to get the wireless working again, no biggy, but I am glad I checked though as if we had been away from property I could not have remotely accessed system.<//review><Time>1528830930485< /Time></record>

He asked if I had any issues, "no." So regular service was performed. Between this service call and the last routine maintenance I did have a problem with my AC. Hyde responded promptly, identified the problem and fixed it. It turned out to be a minor issue and the charge, basically just for a service call, was not inflated.
I recommend Hyde for AC work and AC system maintenance.</review>< Pictures>

Juan did an excellent job. Very thorough, very efficient, very friendly, and informative. He identified an issue, order the part and will return next week to complete the repair. I ALWAYS recommend Hyde's to all my friends, family and anyone else who happens to be in need of A/C help.

I am disputing my service contract with them now for the $145.00 I paid 7 days before. I suggest you look elsewhere for service. They charged me $165.00 for a capacitor you can buy for $38.00 and watch several videos on YouTube as to how simple they are to install. BTW the price for the capacitor was $194.00 before my discount. I am 81 and I feel like I’ve been ripped off as a senior, I hope they are not taking advantage of elderly people. I am going to contact AARP & BBB and give my review about this company.< /review><time>1540681775337</time>< Gmap_id>

Today, our 7yr-old dishwasher stopped working, causing a need to replace it.  After purchasing a new one, we returned home to find the temperature in our house at 86 degrees.  We purchased the air conditioner 9 yrs ago from Hyde's and called for help once during that time.  In less than 30 minutes Greg arrived, checked and replaced a faulty contactor.  It has been a trying day, but I couldn't be more pleased with your service from the moment my phone call was answered to the completion of the repair.  The air conditioner appears to be working and, hopefully, you will not hear from us soon. Thank you.</review>

Great was courteous and efficient. He explained in detail what needed to be done. I am ver knowledgeable in anything electric so I understood all he told me. But if I were a layman and had no knowledge of the inner runnings of an AC/Heater...I still would have understood what he needed to do. Trust is important with me and I have always felt that trust with HYDES ad especially with Greg.  Thank you<//Text>

Chris and his assistant were right on time and very efficientlly proceeded with the installation of the AC. This would have been great at any time but today July 6, 208 the heat went from 90 degrees at 9AM to 117 degrees at 1PM on the ground and up to 140 degrees on the roof by 3 PM when  Chris completed the installation. In spite of the hostile environment Chis did in my observation an outstanding job. Well done Chris

I feel extremely taken advantage of by this company.  Earlier I gave it high marks, but after an ongoing saga of expensive repairs by them within one single month, I feel totally taken advantage of.  My story is far too long to go into in a review.  They came and did a service yesterday (service prepaid) but I discovered a $335 charge on my credit card by them late in the day.  After many large bills in the summer, they managed to come up with something else to bill me for.  I feel totally ripped off.</text>

We know we want a new a/c unit and Hyde's came highly recommended so we set an appt.  Michael spent a great deal of time with us, presenting not only price options but explaining the "science" of what would be best for our particular home.  We sense true honesty and work integrity with him.< /review>

We returned home at 6pm on a 113 degree Friday evening to find that our AC unit was not working.  Hydes had a technician named Greg onsite within 2 hours.  Greg was professional, skilled, and communicative.  He had us up and the house cooling in a very short time.  What might have been a very uncomfortable experience was avoided with minimal fuss.  Hydes and Greg are the only number we need.  Highest recommendation from us.</text>

I  had an AC malfunction early evenving on a triple digit day. I called Hyde's on the recommendation of a friend expecting to hear that I'd be lucky to get an appointment the following day. To my surprise, I was a given a two hour window for that evening. James, my technician, arrived earlier than expected. (He had called to let me know he was on his way. )James was very pleasant and most professional.  He diagnosed the problem, fixed it in no time, and answered all my questions. I felt very confident that he knew his trade  well. This was my first experience with this company and I was very impressed.< /review>

When I showed technician Frank Velarde the Hepa Filter I use in my bedroom to help with allergies, he told me about the Honeywell UV Air Purifier.  He installed one in the furnace.  He also recommended I spray the garden hose on Air Conditioner to keep the filters clean and did that for me.  I am a satisfied first-time client and have requested Frank as my regular technician.< /review>

Daniel was on time, very polite and made sure to use his booties each time he entered the house. He explained what he did as part of the spring check up and told us we had a wire that was just coming loose.  Thank goodness we had him here to fix it or we might have been very unhappy if the fan broke in the hot weather!  This is exactly why the fall and spring check ups are a great idea!</Text>

Daniel came in response to our call when our heat pump failed to turn on.
Turned out to be because of a loose breaker contact at the condensing unit which Danny fixed in about one minute with NO CHARGE because we are system maintenance customers.  We only need to use our heat pump about half a dozen times a year but when we need it it is nice to have.<//review>

I just had a new system installed on 6/2/14.  I upgraded to a 3 ton 18 SEER 2 stage system and I can honestly say that I already feel a difference in my home.  I had my thermostat set at 78 and it felt so much cooler than that!  Hyde's also installed a new thermostat so now, I can change the temperature from my iPhone and it will also notify me if my home reaches an extremely cold or hot temperature. They also did some additional work to the plenum due to some unnecessary holes from when my home was built.  They did a great job! I finally feel like my home is getting all the cool air that it should!   I love it!! Thank you Hydes!</Review>

Jonathan arrived promptly and professionally attacked our AC problem.  He identified a defect and corrected it while warning that it might have compromised the system's fan.  While the AC operated before he left it later suffered the failure he predicted.  The problem was repaired within a few hours and now seems to be functioning properly.  Very impressed with  Hyde's quick response and service.</text>

We have had Daniel Hyde before and he is very professional.  I am very please with Hyde and recommend you to anyone that needs service maintenance or a new system.  My neighbor Carole Breard got a new unit from you and also another neighbor across the street has used you.  Their name is Charlene and Willie White.  So you can see I referred you to them.

Thank you,

He worked hard to get us partial cooling so we could sleep in the house. He called for an emergency replacement of the unit and by noon the next day we had cold air. Chris was friendly, polite and knowledgeable. The whole install was very efficient: one team worked on the outside unit and another team worked on the attic unit.  They protected my floors and cleaned up afterwards. They are sending a finishing carpenter to repair the drywall around the attic hatch. All employees were friendly and polite. I felt comfortable being alone in the house with them.< /Review>< Response>

When my air conditioning stopped working, I called Hydes. The friendly receptionist sent a technician who found the problem and got the parts needed to get my Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning system back in working order fast. The cost was reasonable and I even got an extended service plan. Great Job Casey Harrison and thanks Hydes Air Conditioning!<//Text>

I was really happy with the Casey, the technician that came by....
He was very thorough explained what he was going to do. We talked about a variety of options to improve my air conditioning needs. I am familiar with air conditioning and he treated me with respect and filled in the holes of my knowledge where I needed it. I would definitely recommend hyde's air conditioning to anyone.

So it's been a month since Casey's come out for first time and this time we were fearing the worst?
Was there was something more wrong?
As it turns out our compressor was just overheated need to be cooled off and restarted.
I want to thank Hyde's A/C Casey for doing the right thing and making us Believers in Hyde's A/C company.</Text>

James Burrell is top notch! He's been servicing our HVAC system for years, after installing it several years ago. He is technically proficient, personable and knows his stuff. I recommend him and Hyde's without hesitation.<//Review>

Casey made semi-annual service call and found that some parts needed replacement.  He thoroughly explained the function of the parts and how they would affect our cooling.  Made the repairs in a very professional way.

I couldn't be happier with the service Hyde's delivers.  Wouldn't have anyone else touch our heating and cooling needs.

<Review>Chris arrived apologetically that he had a very long appt that morning, but he still came within the scheduled time frame. Chris came to do a seasonal maintenance on my A/C. He was friendly, professional and knowledgeable. Unexpectedly I asked if he could fix some dead outlets. He needed to get some parts at his office and returned 15 minutes later, finishing the job before I needed to leave for an appt. Thanks, Chris for the great service!<//Review>< gmapID>

Called for an estimate for repair/replacement.  He looked at the outside unit, and recommended replacement.  We had another tech coming out from another vendor that afternoon, so we turned the unit on for him...

Nothing happened on the outside unit!

Opened up electrical compartment, and noticed wires hanging loose!  Found that breaker had popped on connection box.  Realized that wiring diagram was now missing.  Pulled breaker, and it was now BURNT!  Needed to now replace breaker.  Canceling check for  the service call!< /text>

<text>Oct.2017: Hyde's technician, Steve Martin, diagnosed our failed master bedroom HVAC unit and completed maintenance servicing on the other two HVAC units.  We were very happy with his service.  We chose this company because of its long time in business and good online reviews.  We ended up having them install a new AC system.
Sept/2019: Chris Schultz came to do maintenance servicing and trouble shoot the new AC system - not cooling.  He quickly identified the reason - loss of refrigerant, and the source of the leak, and fixed it under warranty.  Like Steve, he is very informative and doesn't mind answering questions, which gives one confidence dealing with him.</text>< response>

<text>Added a new outdoor generator connection,  new 100 AMP sub-panel, new 100 AMP switch, and rewired main panel. They also installed a 50 AMP receptacle for my car charger. Aside from the receptacle for the generator, which of course is outside the home, all other additions are professionally laid-out inside the garage. Excellent professional workmanship and all highest grade equipment was used throughout. I also use Hydes for all my A/C work (I have two A/C units) and have their annual maintenance plan which includes two preventive maintenance services per year and discounted repair costs.

Jonnie, Surgio and especially Chris, who did the layout and planning as well as led the installation,  worked as a team and were a pleasure to work with. A Job Well Done!< /text>< Rating>

Casey arrived at my home around 8:30 AM. For the next 3 1/2 hours, he examined my AC,s, and heating. He went up in my attic to inspect my ductwork, took pictures, assessed my insulation, suggested various  options for me to consider. Explained patiently how everything works. He left me with two estimates for work they would do to correct my problems. Casey was professional, knowledgeable, personable,respectfull,neat and kind. Was a total pleasure to meet him. Will highly consider doing business with Hydes Air Conditioning. They are very prompt and Professional from first call, to last good-bye and Thank  you. Glenn< /text>

< Review>
Jeff is my favorite by far. Not that I'm not satisfied with my past service but here a few of the reason I gave him 5 stars.  He didn't make me feel as if he was on time crunch. I had a few questions about my system and because of his excellence in customer service and attention to detail I felt comfortable in making the decision to have a compressor saver installed. He even let me watch and stopped to explain how it worked while he attached it.
Thank you Hyde for being of service. I will continue to recommend your company to all I run into as I've done with my sister and her new home here in the Coachella Valley.
Sincerely, Linda Clavin< /Review>

Hyde's service man ,Jeff Sproul,  came immediately when we found leakage onto a wall from A/C condensate. He found the problem to be gutter and downspout rotting and took pictures that we sent to our HOA. Jeff is a terrific technician  and very responsive. We have had him for service before.< /Review>

I came home from work to a hot house and called Hydes right away. They sent Casey out in less than an hour! He was very professional and kind. He diagnosed the problem right away and got it running again! He even checked the air flow in my kids rooms and made some adjustments to their vents. This is the only company I use and I have lived in the Coachella valley for 45 years.<//Text>

Pleasant, cordial, and professional telephone etiquette when making appointments, and when providing reminders, etc. Technicians also are very professional and courteous and "seemingly" efficient while servicing our A/C  System(s). The score I am submitting has more to do with my questioning the competence, professionalism, and followup as related to my recent experience with this company which until now I considered reliable and responsible.

After Hydes' bi-annual servicing per our contract agreement, I reported a "new noise" very audible around one of the return air ducts.  Hydes was informed of the issue and advised that the return appointment would be for late afternoon the following day. A different technician arrived, and agreed that there was an unusual "whining" noise. The technician's explanation was that the newly installed  filter as part of the servicing, was creating a "metallic" interaction with the metal grill; that this can be a normal occurrence, is not that unusual; and that he would return the next day to install an "adhesive" border/band around the opening which is the normal procedure and which would solve the problem.

The technician did not return the following day so growing a little "tired" of hearing this whining throughout the day, I decided to simply replace the filter with one of my own. The noise immediately went away.  While replacing the filter however, I discovered that rather than insert the filter in the recessed part of the grill designed for that purpose,  the filter was forced in above the recess into the larger actual duct opening.  Pieces of rubber/foam wedges (apparently pieces of rubberized piping insulation) had been placed around the edges of the filter to make it fit the opening, the result of which was a more pronounced continuation of the whining noise we were experiencing. This was the approach of the second Hydes technician in an attempt to quell the noise.

Even I am aware that the recess is designed to fit the exact size of the intended filter and does not require rubber wedges,  nor does it require an advanced degree to see or at least figure out the obvious. Quite baffling to say the least, not to mention my disappointment at the lack of efficiency and heretofore perceived competence of Hydes' technical staff.

Hydes otherwise has been quite prompt, courteous and professional in their demeanor.  I am just not sure why this happened particularly while performing such a basic procedure as changing out filters.  Two days later and no word from Hydes.  The technician still has not returned nor bothered to make contact to explain why, apologize, or to reschedule.

After several years of annual service contracts with Hydes, should I now be forced to lower my expectations or just not renew what I thought was a "professional services" contractual arrangement?<//review>

<Review>We had our heating and air conditioning system (2) replaced by Hyde after one of our air conditioners broke (compressor).  I initially gave them a three star review right after they finished installing the systems because there were four issues that were a problem.  Mr. Hyde came out with my review in hand and talked with us and came up with solutions to the issues by correcting them or giving us a credit.  We are very happy and satisfied with their promptness, professionalism, courtesy and our new system.  The temperature in the house stays very steady and we don't even know when the system is running (18 seer, variable speed).  Looking forward to seeing the savings in energy costs in the coming years.  We had three different quotes when we were in the decision making process for the new heating/ac systems.  We recommend Hyde for your heating and air conditioning needs.< /Review><user_name>David Taratuta</user_name><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>If there were a possible 10 stars available for me to use in my evaluation of Hydes AC, the 10 would still not be enough!  Today was my first introduction to this A+ family run business, and, it promises just to be the beginning!  From the moment that Daniel walked into my home until the minute Daniel said that he had finished, all was perfect.  He explained what he would do, he did what he had to do, and, Daniel gave me his thoughts on what he could do with my existing system!  Hydes should be very proud of this family member.  He is definitely an asset to your already well-known HVAC business!!!!!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dafbeb644242cd:0xd3a7f71b45fcdc4< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5< /rating><text>That was unbelievable! I was so busy out of town and one call to Hydes A/C  and all my problems melted away. They were polite people who cared on my phone. Chris showed up on time overcame a few stumbling blocks and climbed into my attic at 7:00pm. After a short trip to get the correct fuses he replaced them and reset my thermostats. I have a new friend in the desert who I won't forget. Everyone I talked to at Hydes A/C was so polite I knew management treated their associates like family.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>If you or know of someone that needs AC in Indio, Palm Desert or Coachella Valley CA areas, call the best, the only ones I trust...Hydes Air Conditioning. They are honest, dependable, extremely knowledgeable & the most likable people you'll ever meet!
I do business with people I like & trust, never the low price leaders. The value of quality/likability/trust always far outweighs low price.
I recommend Hydes Air Conditioning to everyone I know!</review>< pictures>

AMAZING!!!!!! Amazing and consistent customer experience with a trusted Hyde's team member Chris S. I absolutely love, love, love Hyde's. As a retired Marine, I expect the best. Hyde's always exceeds my expectations. If you want a team that you can trust, Hyde's Air Conditioning is the one that you want.
Semper Fidelis!< /review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Frank did a good job of advising me the results of his service today. He advised me of the need for (4)surge protectors. He advised me he would discuss (as I suggested) with Barry Hyde the need for these on our new A/C system to prevent a possibility of burning out the circuit board in the event of a electrical surge. Having just spent $24,000 on a new systems last June I would think that surge protectors would have been installed at that time, if needed. If they burned out they would end up having to pay for replacing the burned out circuit boards under our warranty. Please  have Barry respond regarding this issue. I am also concerned with the fire danger in the attic also if this were to happen,             Robert Fouyer<//text>< pics>

<Text>Steve came over on time, checked out my system and fixed all issues very quickly and professionally.   He made sure not to dirty my home and also reset my auto thermostat to sync it with the weather updates and alerts.   Steve was very friendly even though our dog wanted to protect her home.   Steve became her friend after 2 minutes of talk and petting.   We have been with Hydes for 3 years since they installed our new A/C System and we love it and Hydes maintains it extremely well.   We have been extremely satisfied with Hydes since day one!< /Text>< pics>

<text>Great service from Hydes Air Conditioning Company. I purchased a home in 2017 with a one year old unit which Hydes had installed in 2016. My utility bill have been very low compared to friends of mine in my area with older units from other companies. I highly recommend Hydes Company. Just Great Service.<//text>< Response>

<Review>The company I represent was experiencing a leaky roof so we suspected it had something to do with the air conditioning. We called Hyde's Air Conditioning, Heating, Appliance Repair and they sent out a tech crew. I talked to head tech Taylor about the situation and he was very helpful and professional as well as expeditious. Before I knew it, the leak was repaired. Taylor clearly explained the problem how it was remedied. I appreciate Taylor and his Hyde crew for their help!</Review>< pictures>

<text>It is hot and humid in early August in the desert and my air conditioner decided to stop working one evening.   Called Hyde's Heating and A/C before 8:00 AM and a tech was scheduled to come that afternoon and by 2:30 Danny  knocked on the door.  By 2:45 the problem was solved and the A/C was in working order.  What a relief.  Thank you, Hydes..< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This morning Chris Schultz serviced my 2 A/C's,  Chris checked out my air conditioners thoroughly as I stood there with him in the heat.  Chris assured me both of my units were in good condition, the compressors were in good working condition and by purchasing new compacitors and Compressor savers for both units my A/C's would last for years to come.  Chris also advised I purchase an extended service contract I would be just fine.  This afternoon my living room, kitchen and dining room went up to 90 degrees.  I called Hyde's about the problem and they said a technician would be out between 8 and 10 PM.  Frank Velarde arrived and evaluated my system and told me I had a bad compressor, then he told me, no, the motor was bad and then he said no it was the Circuit Breaker.  I am seriously confused.  I was so PLEASED with Chris this morning and happy with his service and professionalism but tonight I am upset, confused and out a lot of money.  I spent over $875 today based on the fact that I was told my A/C's were GOOD and by buying a couple of parts they would last for years.  After 24 hours that is not the case.  Last night Barry Hyde personally came out and re-evaluated my A/C problem.  I continue to work with Hyde's because they are such an honest and reputable company.  I have gotten my Home Protection Company/Policy to agree to Hyde's doing the work necessary on my home air conditioners.  I continue in this saga of getting the work done so I once again can enjoy my home and my health is not compromised.  I am a Disabled Veteran.  I have confidence in Hyde's based on past experience with them they installed two air conditioners in my last home.  7/11/2017 I am happy to say that I now have A/C restored and I thank Barry Hyde for  personally going to bat for me and getting my A/C fixed.  You have a customer for life in me Hyde's!<//Text>

Casey was great.  He was knowledgeable and took the time to explain why the air conditioner that the General installed, 5 ton, was causing such unbelievable electric bills.  Seems that the manufacturer, Lynex, wants you to use 5 ton ducts, not 4 ton.  The pressure that builds up is twice what it should be,.and the air conditioner runs 24/7 trying to get the air through the small ducts.   The General's oversell was bad enough, but $700 a month for Electric?  Should have gone with Hyde to begin with.  However, the salesman for the General was a friend, We thought.  It is nice to know that there is such a thing as a family owned business in this valley, one that operates with a strong sense of ethics. I would recommend Hyde to any and everyone.

Simply the Best !

The 2nd of our bi-annual service check up went without a hitch. Not only great peace-of-mind, but extends my warranty. Paying monthly locks me in from any future price increases too.

May, 2018

Top-of-the-line HVAC for the price of a basic level

As our desert temperatures rise now in May, I am so grateful we addressed our HVAC problems in February.

While I can agree with others who have said any brand of HVAC equipment properly installed and maintained will provide excellent service.  My research proved, however, there is a difference …

Comparing cost, unit efficiency, and features, here is my story.

A $2,700 estimate to repair my existing system seemed like a bad investment as so far, the 7-year old 13-seer system has  required $900 in repairs and replacement parts.  The furnace has been trouble-free despite its 22 year age.   To that end, I solicited prices on an entire HVAC system, Furnace and A/C with equipment from American Standard, Carrier, Lennox and York from several desert vendors, including one displaying at our area membership warehouse.  All were first class in their representation of their products, but one company and one vendor stood out.

HYDES and AMERICAN STANDARD

For the price of a low-end Lennox system via Costco, I was able to acquire a HIGH-END, HIGH-EFFECIENCY model superior to anything the others provide.

Although American Standard is commonly associated with bathroom fittings, a corporate break-up in 2007 resulted in the selling of their plumbing division and a corporate name change to TRANE, who produce HVAC systems under both Trane and American Standard.  You may also be familiar with their parent company Ingersoll-Rand.

American Standard – better warranty 12 year compressor

HYDES provides Parts AND Labor for 10 YEARS with their bi-annual maintenance contract.  A typical 2 hour service call would far exceed the maintenance subscription.

On offer was a Zero percent financing option for 36 months making this deal extremely attractive.

Unbelievably QUIET with variable speed compressor, variable speed outdoor condenser fan and variable speed indoor blower.  Talk about COMFORT !

Some local firms have Climate System Representatives who are sales people that evaluate and provide estimates.  HYDES sends out a technician and follow up is provided by company owner, Mike Hyde, who along with his brothers  operate an extremely well-run family organization providing 5-Star Customer Service.  Not surprising that so many of their employees have worked there for years.

A MILLION THANKS, MIKE and to ALL THE CREW AT HYDES.< /Text>< Rating>

<review>The original technician was backed up so I was serviced by another person. He didn't have the correct filter by size but I had a filtrete filter that was the correct size so he installed it. He was on time though ill-pepared. Other than that the service lasted about 15minutes and he was done.< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>Outstanding quality professional and courteous service! Called on a hot  Friday morning for AC repair- given a 2-5  pm timeframe for that same day. Master Technician Jeff Sproul sent a message when he was on his way and arrived right before 2 pm done by 3pm and this included having to go to their main shop to get a motor for the AC. Fair and honest price and repair. I was impressed enough to sign up for their annual maintenance program and received a discount on the present bill.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>The office staff are very caring and helpful. I called at 3:00 P M and had a repair specialist arrive by 6:00 P M. Barry corrected the issue. It was a low fan revlovotion whuch did not allow the compressor to function as it should. This company bends over backwards to product wonderful cutomer service. Thank you very much.

Thank God, because it was really getting hot inside, approaching 90 degrees. He explained the problem, solution, cost, and additional preventive options available to prevent this problem in the future. He wore shoe covers in the house which I much appreciated. I would recommend Hydes to anyone. As a previous C-16 contractor and business owner in the Valley, I have used four different A.C. companies. Hydes is definitely number one in my books. Great job Hydes, keep it up and you will go far.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmap_id>

Casey did a great job troubleshooting that the previous A/C company had either "overloaded" the coolant by 5 lbs., or didn't realize it was "overloaded".  Casey removed 5 lbs. of coolant and the A/C unit sprung back to life.</review>

<Text>The technician was prompt and got to work checking out the A/C system to make sure it was working correctly and to determine if there were any potential problems.  He was thorough  and experienced.  After his lengthy maintenance check, all of the system were working properly.  He explained what he did, such as checking the system for leaks, etc and everything was great.  A couple years ago, the A/C went out in the summer.  Needed someone quick because of my tropical fish, so I picked Hyde from the internet.  That serviceman came within a couple hours and fixed the burned out condenser or capacitor or whatever.  Been working like a charm ever since.  So I chose Hyde to do anymore work if needed.  About a year ago, I had a problem with the A/C.  Apparently the builder put in a 10" intake ducting.  It eventually collapsed.  Hyde came out and found that the builders from Lennar put in the wrong size intake duct.  Should have been 12" diameter.  Hyde came out and replaced it with the proper size.  It was a big, heavy, insulated and awkward piece to drag up into the attic but the technicians did it and solved that problem.  But too bad the warranty ran out from Lennar but it was worth the cost to have it done right.  Got a heating/AC problem.  Call Hyde.<//Text>< Pictures>

Just friendly enough , polite, attentive & so professional as well !They sell the coolest AC's in the whole Coachella Valley, no kidding !!! My Ac is so great , like a refrigerator in here & that  is how  I like it this time of year , i bought from then & only do business with them !!  Frank Velarde was the one who serviced my AC today , he is very knowledgeable & very nice guy . he was very thorough   in his work & did a good job ...Hydes is the only way to go ..If you are with someone else , you need to change to Hydes , trust me , you will be happy & COOL ! Today , July 8 th 2019, I had Chris Schultz, do maintenance  on my fabulous AC, once again  such a polite & good technician ... Thank You Chris ! Hydes has never sent any bad technicians to my house , they are always excellent .....</review>< pictures>

It was 109 degrees outside yesterday when our A/C stopped working. In a panic, we called Hydes A/C and spoke with a cheerful CSR named Janelle. She quickly set up an inspection & within 2 hours a really nice tech named Jeff Sproul showed up at our door eager to help. Fearful of having to come up with the cash to afford a brand new A/C unit, Jeff quickly diagnosed our problem - just a broken fan motor. The news got even better when he said he had a new one in his truck. Bam, done deal! Within 30 minutes, he had that baby installed and the cool air was flowing! At the time, the temp inside our home was 86 and rising, so their quick, efficient service  literally saved our lives!  Thank you Hydes for exceeding all our expectations!
Stay Blest (Blessed + Best),
Lee K.
P.S. When our A/C unit does finally conk-out for good, you'll have our business!<//review>

Great twice-a-year service plan to tune-up our furnace in the Fall and our air
conditioner in the Sping...truly economical.   Have had the pleasure and comfort
of the same tech, Greg Defontes, for five years now....there is no certified tech
who does his/her job any better than Greg.  Thanks, Hydes, for taking care of
us so consistently well.

Again and again; the Hydes service was what I've come to expect: straight to the point, resolved the problem, cleaned up, presented the invoice, got paid and was gone!  Great family-run company!<//Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1480446670204, 'text': "Hi Patti, I am the office manager that just spoke with you.  As I explained, we consider our employees as well as our customers to be family.  We feel that our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who can't treat them with common courtesy.  Even after our conversation I still offered to have someone come during the scheduled appointment time which you refused.  I apologize that we were not able to work together and I wish you luck with your repair.  Duct Pros are another great company that we would recommend for your ducting needs.  Thanks, Janelle"}<//Resp>< UserId.>

poor customer service and employees that are rude. They also do not honor appointments if they feel the job is too small, canceling hours before they are to show up with insulting phone calls.< /text>

<response>{'time': 1507845605907, 'text': 'Hi Joyce, I am so sorry about your leak.  Think of it like having a small leak in your car tire. If left untreated, it can easily turn into a much larger problem.  We will definitely take your feedback seriously and be sure to do a better job explaining this next time and with other customers.  Thank you for trusting us with your repair and we will be sure to pass along your feedback to our technicians.'}<//response><UserId.>106379639369314813671<//UserId.>< Text>
Had Hydes A/C discovered the large leak in my coil on the Sept. 5, 2017, I would have been spared several hundred dollars.  I was told it was a small leak.  Out again on October 6th, out of Freon again and told it was a large leak and coil needed to be replaced to a tune of $2100.  Sorry, not happy about the earlier diagnosis.< /Text>

{'time': 1508183796441, 'text': 'Hi Michael, I tried to look up your account to see if there was a mistake but I did not find anyone with a recent service with your name. Can you give us a call or send me your address so we can resolve the issue?\nI\'m sure that if there is a price discrepancy it was a mistake and not because we are "shady".  We haven\'t been in business for 45 years by charging more than the estimates we give our customers. We are proud that our motto is to "always do the right thing" and would love to have the oppotunity to do that with you today. We are open until 6pm so please give us a call.'}<//Resp>
