Any bad reviews and you guys talk down to the person. Telling people they are uneducated, they need God, they are liars sorry to tell you but your shop is very unprofessional you may have been open over 10 yrs but your attitudes are not polite, you need to work on your professionalism before the BBB is contacted</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>This place seemed nice at first. I went in for a pedicure. Nice designs. Service was appealing to keep coming back. So I decided to go there again for a manicure this time not really listening to the reviews that I had read on here about manicures(when I should have). I just didn't like how as soon as I came in and asked for the price I was ignored I asked a couple times...nothing. I had acrylic nails done. The lady painting my nails screamed at me and got mad when I said I didn't want the gold glitter instead wanted the silver and she exclaimed "Then you go get it!" Like three times I didn't say anything. And just went to go get it. A day later the nail on my right ring finger broke without excessive force. I went back in so it can be fixed they did little to no effort to make them exactly like the others. She clearly did an effortless quick fix and as soon as she showed me saying that she was done I corrected her mistakes and as always they start to all talk crap about it in their language. Very uncomfortable. She kept getting mad because I was pointing out what was wrong. Like I'm paying for this service it's not like it's free. A week later the pinky nail on my left hand broke off and again without excessive force. The nails feel so fragile. I had never had acrylic nails that break off within a week that's just absurd. These women are rude and don't care about giving you good service but the money they're getting from you beware coming to this place at your own risk. I also think they are too expensive for their cheap material and service, rude boss and employees.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The last time i came here is going to be my last time the lady did my nails all lumpy and fat. But just there is one specific lady i did like because on my birthday she did give me flat short white nails they were perfect. She carries her iphone x with earbuds in her cart</Review>

< Review>
My wife went in for a manicure and no matter how many times you ask them how much for something they don't tell you. keep you in the dark and even though their prices are listed on a board they secretly add more stuff on purpose to have you pay more at the end. Pedis are listed at a 17 ended up paying 21. me and my wife were wondering why turned out that just because they scrubbed her feet they added 4 more dollars they didn't even ask. Anyone wanting to come here BEWARE!!! Bad service and really rude, and their nails don't last long, a week tops!!!!< /Review>

You and your wife may open or have friends/relatives who open a similar service nearby. It is fine. Do your business and focus on service rather than go to other business and telling lie. We always tell price for customers, no hidden fee. 1000% sure consistenly. Our basic pedicure is $13. Where you get $17 from unless a lie? Callus treatment is always being asked before apply. If customer agrees, they will be informed the price of $5 extra. Where you get $4 from unless your lie. Amigo, we do not recognize your face and your wife's face as one of  our recent customers from the carema system. If l telling lie can make your soul better, we pray peace be with you.

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>QUICK TIP: IF YOU DON'T READ MY FULL REVIEW, AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK AT MY POOR PINKIE THAT WAS BUFFED RAW FROM MY MANICURE.

Let me start off by saying how awfully deceiving these reviews are! Since I'm from SF, I don't have all my "go to" spots anymore...so I took a risk on this place. I rarely get my nails "professionally" done, so this time I was "treating" myself out. Boy did that take a wrong turn!

So basically, if you haven't looked at my pic that I uploaded yet, PLEASE DO. This is how my 3 star experience went for the wrong turn. So as I was getting my pedicure, which was pretty crappy too (the polish chipped within 4 days and she did not make the skin on my feet smooth at all), the manicurist was prepping me for my gel manicure. I guess I have a high tolerance for pain because I didn't notice she had completely buffed a whole section of my skin off while she haphazardly decided to use the buffer with the really rough, crystallized texture. I actually didn't even notice until she stopped and tried to secretly blot the blood that was gushing out of my finger. Yes, I said blood. So then the girls wouldn't let me wash my hands because I was highly paranoid about getting an infection and said that they would just spray alcohol on it--which is great but I just like to know I've washed ALL the gunk off my hands. So with the alcohol, she didn't even completely clean off the remaining blood on my nail, so yes, my manicure has this ugly brown stain at the bottom of my nail. Eww! Not to mention, my nail was stinging and in pain for the next day--pamper session gone totally wrong!!

Ugh, needless to say, I'm NEVER going back and I hope I save at least some people from going through such an awful experience. It's one thing to get something done inexpensively and to go into it not expecting OUTSTANDING quality, but it's another to walk out with $40 less and with a raw finger.</review>< Pics>

The room was lovely. The shower pressure was great. The breakfast food was good and the service was excellent! I would definitely stay here again.<//Review>

The Atrium Garden Inn is a wonderful place to stay. My husband and I stayed three nights to celebrate our anniversary, and although we first came as guests at the inn, we left feeling like family. There are so many intricate details in the way the inn has been remodeled and decorated that it feels like a home away from home. The owner Beth puts her heart into all that she does at the inn, which definitely includes the breakfast! She arrives at 4:30am every day to ensure that a warm and delicious homemade meal is made with the freshest ingredients and is available for guests by 7:30am. My husband and I chose to sit at the table closest to the kitchen, and as a result were able to enjoy many intellectual conversations with Beth as we ate our breakfast. Beth wants every person to feel comfortable at the inn, so if guests need anything they are welcome to ask for it. The innkeeper Michael was very helpful and thoroughly explained self check-in procedures when I called to let him know we would be running late and arrive after 8:00pm. In person he is kind and always smiling and has many stories to tell. When we forgot one of our travel pillows in the room after leaving, Helena promptly messaged us and asked us what we would like them to do with it. The inn even has a very sweet cat called Ru that greeted us when we arrived and Beth brings her dog Choco, making the place very pet friendly. Overall the experience was magnificent and we look forward to returning soon!</text>

It’s never easy to repair a place’s reputation but the new management of the B&B are doing an excellent job! The room was spacious enough for my boyfriend and I, the bathroom was very clean and the check in and out process were quick and easy. Breakfast that came with the room was incredible, everything we could have wanted from fresh bread, bacon, eggs, sausage, quiche, muffins and pastries....this is definitely where I will stay when I’m up here from now on. Great job to the new management.<//review>

<text>I showed up at the tail end of a destructive winter storm that had downed trees and broken doors.  Despite the chaos, Beth and Helena went well out of their way to ensure my family's comfort.  Breakfast was above and beyond, their guidance was on point, and they were even hospitable to my dogs.  Wouldn't stay anywhere else!<//text>< pictures>

My husband and I stayed at the Atrium for two days and loved every minute of it. The two ladies that run the place are very kind and patient, and they had great recommendations for things to do in town. The room we wrre in was called the quilt room and was very clean and cozy. The breakfast was delicious! Fresh fruit, great coffee, and good home style cooking. The atrium is in a great location and withing walking distance of whatever you may be interested in. Overall, it felt like staying with family you haven't seen in a while. We will definitely be back.</text>

Nice large room, great bed. Walls paper thin, so slept very little. Ultimately depends on who is staying there, so bit of a gamble. No one in office, so you just pick up key from lockbox. No breakfast, so technically not a B&B. Nice location, close to beach, and plenty of parking in back. Nice sitting area outside, but may want to bring something to block sunlight out from windows that have only see through blinds. Liked the place overall, just not great if you want to sleep.< /Text>

Great location, extremely pedestrian accessible. Not great accommodations, unless you're looking for bare minimum. Do not come here if you're unable to navigate narrow and high staircases. The space itself varies based on what room you request to be in, some being WAY nicer than others, so expect the unexpected. We sure were surprised.< /review>

<text>Really cute place, but they need to fix a couple of things in the room... for instance, we are unable to close one of the window blinds. The staff was really nice, and the hotel is located in a good spot, lots of places to eat around.  The brewery nearby is a great place to have dinner in the weekend, they have live jazz.  There is also a nearby ice cream place that serves really yummy home made ice cream.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>Such a cute space & perfect for our little escape from the city. Located close to the beach & downtown. Walking distance or enjoy a little ride on one of the bikes they provide for their guests. We can't wait to visit again.< /Review><time>1490664803035</time><pics>None<//pics>< username>

<Time>1491004919063</Time><Text>We visited for a quick weekend getaway and could not imagine staying in a better location! We were walking distance to trails, restaurants, shops, etc., which was extremely convenient. The room itself was very cozy, the bed was comfortable, and the hosts were extremely gracious when it came to reccommendations. The only shortcoming was the lack of access to a refrigerator. Being from out of town, we were able to enjoy the amazing restaurants but our leftovers had to be left behind. We enjoyed our stay and wish to visit again in the future!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80803537bce0ca81:0xca5f27291620433d<//Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>105855777145581153285</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Clean, comfortable room. Friendly staff. Warm breakfast (frittata, sausage, granola and yogurt) was nice in the morning. In the afternoon, they also served us tea and brownies. Walking distance to a few restaurants and the North Coast Brewery. It's a good bed and breakfast. We'd go back again.< /Text>

<Text>Really not worth the money. The location doesn't even serve breakfast any more. (We weren't told this until we arrived after booking.) Not to mention we were told breakfast across the street (Cafe 1, great place by the way.) was comped up to $30. They did not honor that statement. The room was tiny, the traffic on the street was annoying and loud. It's next to a run down auto body shop, and the shared bathroom had only two towels. If you're coming to explore Fort Bragg do NOT stay at the Atrium. If this place was $75/night I'd consider it. But not for the prices they charge.< /Text>< resp>

The Atrium Bed & Breakfast is cute, clean, and cozy. It has a great location for local shopping, glass beach, the botanical garden, and other hot spots in the area. The hosts were very nice and responsive to questions.< /text>

Their new stationery identifies the property as a Bed and Bike (a B&B, just not the kind you might think). I booked a preferred room ("Lodge") over the phone with the owner, but upon arrival 4 months later found that the property had changed hands, breakfast was no longer served, and the new management  claimed ignorance of my very traditional booking arrangement. The preferred room that I arranged had been given to another party. Complaining that I was "out two breakfasts" promised to me by the previous owner  the manager arranged to have two continental breakfasts (muffin and berries) left at our door both days. This WAS done. Also in apology for losing our reservation the owner had management deliver a nice bottle of cabernet to us. So there's that. I regard what happened to us as an unique deal and would not be repeated. Nevertheless, the accomodations are comfortable and each room is unique. Also if you can wangle a reservation in the room named "Lodge" you should probably stay there.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

<review>The Atrium B&B was a wonderful place to stay. The room was nice and clean, they had great customer service and it was within a short walking distance to all the downtown stores and restaurants. We would definitely recommend the Atrium B&B to anyone looking for a place to stay in Fort Bragg.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>If you just want a bed with few amenities close to town, this is the place. The room is nice but there was a major miscommunication with the owners and we were put in the wrong room. There are no coffee makers in the rooms, just pour overs, and a tiny refrigerator. The WiFi is not strong and has issues if more than one person is using it.< /review><Time>1500049113844<//Time><Pics>None< /Pics>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We had a great stay in Fort Bragg at the Atrium. We came here to go to the sea glass beach which was totally worth the 4 hour drive from Palo Alto, Ca. We chose the Atrium because it looked nice on the pictures, was close to the glass beach and they allow dogs. We didn't wanna stay at a motel 6 or something. We paid $305 for 2 nights for 2 people plus dog incl. breakfast and tax. It was totally reasonable. The room was clean, the bed was very comfy! The bathroom was on the floor but 2 steps from our room. The service was very nice. Great breakfast with egg soufles, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, coffee, oj, tea.... it was yummy and they have a very pretty relaxing backyard/garden area! We had a great stay and would come back.<//Text>< Pics>

I was received an email saying they want to do a phone interview they kelp asking if Hispanic because of my last name but I didn’t think anything of it. After the phone interview they said we will forward your application to the store and they should call you back for an interview which would be the second part of the interview. I never got a call back instead I got an email 2 weeks later saying they are not moving forward with my application which was all based off the color of skin.</text>

Manager is rude and dismissive. Then there is the issue I ran into with them placing misleading signs around certain items around the store then once you get them up to the register its a different price. They're hoping people won't notice and will just get the mispriced items, and they do. It's happened to me a couple times.< /review>

The customer service rep said it could take between a few hours and a few days to be returned. I'm optimistic but it is most likely going to be a headache. Don't use the atm lol.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>if i could give this place a no star or half star i would.. i went in before closing so i wouldn't have to wait in the heat during the day.. standing outside just to get something that would take 5 mins at the most.. anyway i grab my 3 items.. wait in line at check out.. 2 people ahead of me with over flowing carts probably due to panic buying... cashier decides to close down.. no one is behind me.. so why close down before me... only other line there was, was down the middle of the isle...never shopping at this place again...this place should at least let the instacart shoppers a head of the lines..<//review>< pics>

Because if u go too early they have stuff out that they are trying to put away and if you go in the evening they are really busy. So far no complaints and i go here for all my groceries 1 to 2xs a wk. I will have to say they could use more vegetables.</Text>< pictures>

We had a late evening pen chant to engage in the consumption of some adult beverages and did not want to break the bank. We found a large and reasonably priced selection of spirits at Foodsco. The hours made this even more attractive and we will gladly refer our friends to this place of business.< /Review>

<username>MSM MSM<//username><date>1546798870867<//date><rating>4< /rating><review>Foodsco is my go to local grocery store. Prices are way better than Safeway or Raleys but a little higher than big box Winco. There is nothing super fancy about this store but they always have specials on some type of beef chicken or pork. When they do I always load up. Over all their everyday prices are Fair and reasonable. A couple years ago they put in a new freezer section so everything is easy to find. For 95% of the things you need I would go there. Generally the lines are shorter than any place else unless you foolishly decided to go at 5 p.m. on a work day. I know several of the checkers and they are always friendly and happy to see you< /review>< pics>

Interior can be either chilly cold or uneasily warm depending on weather so dress accordingly. Watch yourself and belonging when walking out to car. Employees are friendly enough.<//Text>< Response>

Great prices, well-trained and informed staff, an all around great store! They have a huge produce section full of fresh, undamaged goods for ridiculously low prices. Their store brand "Kroger" is high-quality and hugely inexpensive. This store is a haven for an EBT budget.<//text>

Inexpensive
I went to your store the other day and went to the cashier says 15 items only. The one in front of me had 30 items. The employee told her she should have go to the regular cashier but still he scan her groceries anyway. All the people behind me and complaining. This customer knows she's on the express lane but just ignored the sign. Please let your employee how to say NO</Review>

This store is only nice to shop at if you only need little things. Because they never have what you want here! It's like they never restock their shelfs.</Review>

This place is like the anus of food stores. Foods Co puts the gross into grocery stores. Its looks and feels like it was decorated and built with all the warmth and charm of San Quentin. The checkers give you that same warm fuzzy feeling you would expect from a dark alley drug deal. Trying to find anything is like a scavenger hunt without the fun and the vultures who work there being the buzzards who are circling around their own dead hopes and dreams as they feed off of whatever misery they are able to glean off the poor souls who wander in to this dump. The clerks are indifferent at best and do not inspire confidence in their "fresh" food.<//Text>

<Text>Prices are always low, however, theres always a price to pay for low prices...the store is not the cleanest of grocery stores, people in the parking lot are sketchy...all the time. For those of you who like to use coupons...go somewhere else, this store does not accept manufactures coupons. However, if your looking for something quick and cheap...this is it.< /Text><username>Pamela Smith< /username><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

It wasn't terrible customer service. A cashier gave my elderly grandma that barely speaks english the wrong change whether it was on accident or not and the receipt was half printed so we couldn't even see the total of the prices. So we head back and asked for a full receipt to see if my grandma gave the right amount of money & we were right they gave the wrong change the cashier was being rude and so was the manager they gave us terrible customer service and didn't even apologize about it. Horrible place to shop & if this is the only place you have available to you I suggest you check your change every time no matter what store it is<//Review>

<Text>Bad day at work today for everyone there?
Checker rang up 21 cans of dog food even though I clearly went over 20 cans with her all while she leaned on the couner the entire time. Went to custimer service desk was told by passing employee to go back in line (long line!) Asked for a manager. Said same thing "go back in line." Refused to get back in line for their mistake. No resolution so I left. Cart wheels locked as soon as I walked out the door. Called for a manager. Told her what happened. She said didnt hear alarm so she didnt know cart locked. I told her thats why I called.  She unlocked wheels and rudely said "your welcome!" Sorry but I'm  not about to thank you for problems your store caused! No apologies-nothing!  Customer service non-existent at this store. I am pretty sure no one forced anyone to take a job there so don5t blame customers if you're nit happy!< /Text>< Pics>

After noticing one of my “all day running lamps” were burnt out, I dropped in to see if they had time to fix and replace the bulb. Of course they did! The were able to get my replacement bulb delivered and work was done in a timely manner. As an Uber and Lyft driver of Redding I am very grateful for their awesome service and I’ll definitely be coming back to them. Thanks guys for everything !!</review>

I was traveling on I 5 when my car stopped running. AAA towed me to Bryant automotive. My car had to spend the night there. So they called got me a room reservation for me and my dog. Next morning they called told me my problem was mass air flow sensor. Nice and inexpensive they didn't try to sell me anything else. If I lived there they would be my only shop to go. Great people.< /Review>

Bryants Automotive is the only place to get your car fixed! Honest and trustworthy mechanics/tecs. They kept me u to date every step of the way. Our jeep was so messed up after the dealership we bought it from lied to us that we needed a place to take it that would be willing to go thru every single detail and fix everything. Not an easy job. We had to keep it there almost 2 months and they documented every detail for us for our future court proceedings with the dealership and updated us every week. Since we picked it up it has ran like a champ! I cant express my gratitude to Bryant Automotive enough! They made my husbands dream jeep into a reality and their business ethic, professionalism and level of knowledge is beyond words. Thank to them! They are the only mechanics i will ever trust with my vehicles ever again.<//text>

I went to Bryant Automotive, first week of July in 2020, after experiencing a brake light, low fluid warning on my dashboard and after an oil change service rep saw brake fluid slowly leaking from my rear brake caliper. I was worried about losing my brakes.

I took the vehicle to Bryant and they charged approximately $25.00 to diagnose the problem. They pretty much said brake fluid was leaking from the caliper and recommended  both rear calipers be replaced, along with the brake pads. They quoted me approximately $750.00 for the job (replace rear calipers and brake pads).

I was worried about having my brakes go out on me so I reluctantly agreed for the job. I felt like this was a high price for the job. They did say it was a slow leak and I could probably drive on it, but it would eventually cause low break fluid levels. I asked if they could lower the price to $500.00 and I got an immediate no.

I'm not certain, but I remember the gentleman saying my brake fluid was dark, but afterwards I asked if the fluid was flushed and he said it wasn't. This confused me, but I could have misunderstood. Overall, they were nice, but I feel like the price was way too high. I called Les Schwab today  in Redding and they quoted me a price of approximately $525.00 for the same job, but even including putting new rotors along with the pads.

While the service was nice and Bryant was able to service me the same day, on a very busy day for them - I waited around for at least 4+ hours plus - I live out of town and was in a pickle. I would recommend Les Schwab as they have better prices if you need to get brake work done. Bryant did waive the $25.00 diagnostic fee.

I can't speak for other type of work they perform. Only what is referenced in this review. I feel somewhat buyers remorse as the offer I countered of $500 was more in line with what Schwab quoted. Anyways, I think it is important to have price transparency for customers as this is what matters, along with service, so I hope this write up helps. I'll give two stars for service, and it appears they did good work, though its only been a few days. But the price was not almost 45%-50% percent more than Schwab.< /text>

Also they did things like reduce the brake labor because they would be in there anyway for the ball joints. They gave me good, detailed estimates and kept me informed about problems and details. They use good quality parts, they're straight forward and they're HONEST!  What more can ya ask of a shop?

<text>I love Bryant! They are fair to me and never take advantage of me because I'm female.  Bob at the desk always takes the time to explain what is wrong and how it can be fixed. I have been their customer since 2004. If they don't do it (such as body repair), they always recommend another business that is also a good deal. I highly recommend them.  They are truly concerned about the customer.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Definitely not worth your time or money. It's hard to believe they have certified technicians.

Last October I brought my truck in for a diagnosis on why my truck was misfiring. After dropping it off I was called not two hours later to tell me they were done. Instead of a real diagnosis I was simply told I needed a new engine, that I had low compression in a cylinder.

After tearing into the engine myself I found the problem, a blown AFM lifter. I replaced all of the AFM components myself and my engine has ran like new since.

Fast forward to today, I bring my vehicle in for a smog inspection. They didn't complete the inspection because I do not have CA legal catalytic converter, understandable. However when I return to pick up my truck, my driver's side door will not open. When I ask which mechanic worked on my truck they simply tell me that the mechanic is on lunch and that there is no possible way they could have broken my driver's door. My door opened and closed just fine when I dropped it off, interesting that it no longer worked when I picked it up.

Don't waste your time here.<//review>

Had a few great experiences with them where they were able to take care of both of our cars without any hassle. Today the person who answered the phone (Craig) seemed pretty short and kind of rude without really helping us at all when we got in a tough spot with our car. Probably wont be going back again, try to find a different place that you trust.< /text>

<Review>For the last 10+ years we only take our cars to Bryant Automotive.  They are exceptional in quality, knowledge and service.  If you live anywhere in the Redding CA area I highly recommend that you try this up to date business!  If you are traveling in the North State of California area and need help go to Bryant Automotive!

In addition to their outstanding service and knowledge, they are efficient, honest and have the cleanest shop I ever seen.  They are also very kind, patient and totally customer friendly.

We will not go anywhere else for regular service, minor or major issues; we will call them first if we are out of the area before doing anything!  Please consider this shop as your "go to" shop!< /Review><user_name>Annarae Luevano< /user_name><UserId.>110742484637940701301< /UserId.>< Resp>

< review>
I brought my son in for a hair cut. I explained how I wanted it. The girl that cut his hair seemed bothered and very rushed. As I was explaining his hair cut she spoke right over me to another customer like she could care less what I was saying. When my son was done, I looked at his cut and she did a horrible job. It was not clean and tight, she didn't trim around his face or neck. So, I brought it to her attention and asked her to please trim around his ears, neck and face. She responded by telling me that if that is what I wanted then I should of told her. In the 11 years my son has been getting hair cuts, I have never had to tell a stylist to clean up around his face, ears and neck. She was flat out rude and extremely unprofessional. I will never go back or take anyone in my family there.</review>

She took her time giving me a beautiful style. I left feeling like a queen. When shopping for the wig I now wear, I brought pictures of the soft curls Liz gave me and based my choice on matching her beautiful work. I am grateful to Liz for putting joy into my day at a time when kindness means more to me than it ever has.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I have been to alot of different hair salons in Redding. Typically whichever part of town ill be in I find one to get my haircut. That's until I tried Xpert Cuts by Target. They truly have professional stylists working there. Always friendly and be sure to let you know what kind of wait your looking at if any at all. Most i've ever waited was 10 mnts and it was from the convience of my car. I have had my hair cut by three different stylists and it's always the same excellent results. That is really hard to find, especially in redding. Last few times was Liz, highly reccomend her or any of the stylists at the Xpert cuts by Target.< /Text>

I have an infant who cannot wear a mask and was asked to leave because he wasn’t wearing one. Per CDC guidelines infants and children aged 2 and under are not to wear masks due to them feeling like they cannot breath because there is something over their face. My older child and I were wearing masks. As a nurse I am aware of this, please (management) take time to educate yourselves as well as your employees on COVID 19 guidelines. Anyways, we gave our business to Supercuts and are very happy with the haircut!</Text>

I used to love this place before they got rid of all the most experienced stylists. Now it feels impersonal and just get them in and get them out. I wish they would have kept some of talented people they had before. They would not even tell me where my favorite hair stylist went. After many calls to different salons, I finally found Amy, she is working at C & C Hair in Cottonwood, if any one else is trying to find her. I would have appreciated it if they just let me know.</text>

Took my daughter in to get her haircut and they said that she had head lice.  After spending $100 at the doctor and having her looked at she never had head lice or nits.  Taking and washing all of her clothes bedding and ripping everything out of the room and clean it over there the weekend while we're waiting for a doctor.  Plus to add insult to injury they did not cut her hair and did charges for the visit.

We called them back after the doctor visit they said a manager would be getting back to us regarding a compensation and they never did call back

People of Redding do not get your haircut here this is a poor place of business</Review>

<Review>I went in yesterday, asked for a very simple trim to my very simple A-line, and the girl chopped all of my hair off :( at first i thought it wasnt too horrible- i enjoyed her conversation and even tipped her- but i went home and washed my hair and it sits even SHORTER naturally  AND it is not even at all!!!!! I don't want to go out in public for another year and a half, because that's how long it took to grow it out the last time it was chopped off somewhere else. Yay depression and severely lacking self confidence!

It was even more upsetting because another hairstylist walked in halfway through my cut, and was being SO attentive and polite and helpful for another family. I wish i had arrived 30 minutes later and maybe i wouldnt look or feel so stupid.

Yes, i could call or go back in, beg for my money back.... but 16 bucks honestly doesnt make a difference. Keep it. It can't buy me my hair back or a wig or extenstions or any solution to this. Just know i was crying for hours after i went home yesterday. 👍

UPDATE: i went back today and the other hairstylist from yesterday fixed my cut. I didnt think i could feel better with it being so short, but she took the time to even it out and fix it completely. Not want i wanted but i feel cuter. Thank you guys for making it right.<//Review><Name>Elizabeth< /Name><Rate>3<//Rate>< GmapID>

<Text>Almost choked from the chemical smelling perfume that was being sprayed in the store. When I said how strong the smell was and that  my throat was closing up the employee snipped we have to spray fragrance, it is what it is’  basically deal with it.  Really?? Well whoever corporate is. Please stop telling your employees to spray. It’s offensive.< /Text><rating>1<//rating><gmap_id>0x80c2c0f8b87ebc09:0x8903bd8c1afef79c<//gmap_id>< time>

<Text>I enjoyed my sandwich with lots of sprouts on it. It was a pretty good veggie sandwich. They dont have a huge variety of toppings to choose from but I still enjoyed my food. My husband wasnt as pleased with his sandwich. There wasnt anything specific he didnt like, he just didnt enjoy the sandwich either time he visited this sandwich place.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I know you're thinking 1 star is a bit harsh... but I will explain my rating, and maybe you'll agree with me, maybe you won't.... but here it is.

I walked into this particular location at 10:30 in the morning, with an extremely full bladder. Noticing that I was the ONLY person in the restuaunt, I waited 129 seconds for her to finish whatever task she was doing before asking "how can I help you?"

Finally I was able to very politely ask her; "I know it's against policy, but would you possibly do me a favor and let me use your restroom just this once? It's kind of an emergency.."

To which she responded, verbatim; "Actuaaalllllyyyyyyyyy, the bathrooms are for customers only...so...yeah...."

I thought about reiterating the fact that I had prefaced my request with "I know it's against your policy..."
...that's why I was asking for the favor...

But I kept my cool, and seeing as my bladder was at critical mass, I countered her rejection with a new compromise;
"Okay that's fine... can I buy a fountain drink to solidify my status as 'Customer', and then use the restroom? How much is a small soda?"
"2.50"
"Okay no problem, can I get a small Dew and the key for the restroom?"
"Actuaaalllllyyyyyyyyy I won't be able to do that..."
"May I ask why not?"
"We don't open until 11 o' clock."
I looked at my watch and it was about 10:45.

Trying desperately to locate the smallest shred of humanity in her heart I ask:
"Can I please just buy something from you? Anything? I really need to use the restroom.."
"Actuaaalllllyyyyyyyyy no..."

I incredulously asked her why she seemed so ready to help me when I walked in, if she was going to refuse the business I was offering her in exchange for the use of her restroom.
She replied to this with: "Yeah... I'm sorry but the restrooms are only for customers."

....as if she hadnt already gotten that point across..

I finally guessed that I wasn't going to recieve any semblance of customer service from her. So I mentioned to her that if she didn't want people walking in and buying things that she should probably keep the front door locked and turn off the OPEN sign in the front window... and as I was walking towards the exit SHE STARTED MIMICKING WHAT I JUST SAID UNDER HER BREATH! LIKE A 5 YEAR OLD!
When I asked for her name to include in this review, she refused to tell me.
"I'm not obligated to share that information with you, sir"
I called her again once I got back to the car and politely asked for her name and the name of her supervisor. AND SHE HUNG UP THE PHONE ON ME.

I understand adhering to your workplace policy... I even respect her diligence.... but when I offered to be a customer, I did so very politely.. despite my rising state of discomfort... just to get turned down for no reason and mocked for giving her  advice that might help people not be as confused as I was... and then refused to take responsibility for her actions by not giving me her name.

After this upsetting encounter, I went to the car to tell my girlfriend about it. I had her pose as a prospective applicant so that she could go inside and get the name of the employee in question for me...

She came back with 2 things:
1. a complaint about the way she was received. [Apparently I'm not the only one who thought she lacked manners]
and 2. a business card with the employee's name & number.....
I was extremely surprised to learn that the incredibly rude employee was none other than Jacqueline Cherry THE GENERAL MANAGER!
If this is how management treats their customers, I can't even imagine what cretins the rest of the staff must be.

I for one have had enough of this particular JJ location to last me forever. I will never EVER spend my money here. Even if I was starving and it was the last restuaunt on the planet.... purely out of principle.

You've just lost a customer for life, South- Coast Jimmy John's..... and now Google users know the exact dimensions of the pole you have jammed up your respective  anus's. I sincerely hope you lose business. You should not be managing anything with that attitude.<//Text>

<Name>Walter Macalma< /Name><text>Jersey Who? Cappriotti's what?

Being a Socal native we always hear about the east coast regional foods that "supposedly" make our 'California" lifestyle food taste like bunk. This is only from transplants who really just miss home and their comfort foods. Most will not disagree with them because most people don't travel like me, haven't been where I've been or eaten where/what I've eaten.

Their commercials may suck and their app might glitch, their site may be slow, but I'm about to get real fat up in here with OC now having 5 locations and 1 less than 10 minutes from my office. Thought they aren't open as late they do deliver and you can, call, online or app order ahead. Having done both online ordering for immediate pickup and mobile ordering en route I can say it's convenient. Pretty straight forward and easy once you've signed up online. I'm still unsure what their delivery radius is, but at any given time you'll see 4-5 cars in the lot ready. Not sure about minimum delivery either.

It's small, the décor is traditional if you've been to JJ's before. If not it's got the marble fake grain looking tile all around with white one's up the ceiling. Nostaligic pictures and a very sterile almost Firehouse subs ness to it (if you're only from here and are into subs, you'll know what I mean). It's always got a ton of people working. It should garner quite a bit of attention from the yuppy crowd as I gets good exposure. Historically the places here didn't get much, but I really think having a mixed use shopping and food court options here stifle both. It is too small and compact to compete with the Target, Chase lots down the way. Parking is pretty bad. Service is excellent, though having only been here 3 times I can't say about their latenight. Prices are good because of value and I'll elaborate on that below.

The biggest complaint about any sandwich is going to be how soggy the bread is or did it fall apart. Neither is applicable here. The bread has a nice crust, almost French baguette-esque, It doesn't fold or break like others so holds all the fresh ingredients together. Not too much lettuce and tomatoes. Mayo isn't too heavy or too lite, but you can customize that. The club sandwhiches are a whole different story. Thick bread, but not overwhelming as all their sandwiches are pretty hefty fillings. It's really more if people want a roll or slices. The Turkey 8 inch is super solid, hearty, but light, forget about the calories because you'll probably be shocked either way. The Vito with peppers and dressing on the side is much heavier and bold, but worth it as cappicola, my favorite of the non European charcutterie, is abundant. Forget the slims it's just bread, meat and cheese, basically 90% of the whole calorie intake, not enough variance in flavors and textures to keep you interested. Do not eat the gargantuan, it's the equivalent of 2-3 sandwiches in 1, literally. It loses something in terms of flavor because it's not cohesive, just a ton of flavors.

If you learn to like this place you'll love the fact that where the JJ's originated many are open till 4am and deliver till 4am and for a solid sandwich you can see why it's got such a following. I regularly use them as a fall back when I can't find anything else near my hotel when I travel so it's an absolutely convenient pleasure to have something I consider comfort food as a traveler near my work and hopefully creeping down to my home in SD.</text><user_id>109815267831202318650<//user_id><Time>1449567728487</Time>< Gmap_id>

Then just recently had an employee there hit me in there car as I was riding my bike just past there business. The man offered me $20 and cigarettes, He moved my bike away from his car and drove off didn’t give me any of his info just pulled a hit and run. Have a lot of friends and family that will never go there again and will put the word out.< /review>< Pics>

Me and my dad came here for a hot shave and it was such a chill atmosphere. Pop got free whiskey and I loaded up on water while waiting. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and knew what they were doing. It was my first straight razor shave, so I was a bit nervous, but everything went very well. Prices are on par with the service. It's great to treat yourself every so often!<//Review>

OMG! Third times a charm... I have finally found my SF barber and spot. I love my cut, and the whole entire experience. The vibes at People's on Valencia are awesome. Grateful for my cut and already booking a future appointment.< /review>

<text>Wonderful experience for a post-pandemic haircut and shave. Pre-pandemic, I went to Supercuts or Great Clips simply because I've never experienced a difference between a $20 haircut/shave/trim and a $100 haircut/shave/trim. This time, I experienced the difference. My next appointment has already been scheduled, but it isn't for post-pandemic hair and beard, so we'll see if the experience remains the same.

<text>Refused to give hair cut to female friend because barber ‘didn’t feel comfortable’ to cut their hair in a ‘masculine way’. Worst service because their job is to cut hair and she refused to do so. MAKES NO SENSE!<//text>< Pictures>

I had an appointment for 5:30. Was told to wait outside in the cold. I was fine with that and decided to give some grace time. By 5:40 there was no word and no one checked on me. Please respect people’s time!!

(I was using a zip car so time was crucial).</Text>

<Text>When it comes down to my hair and especially getting my haircut  i can be rather picky and a tad bit nervous as i usually let my hair grow out to the so called bieber haircut even though i may be older apparently he wore it best. However that being said I finally came to the realization that i was in need of a haircut, so on a recommendation from a good friend and the fact of him paying I made my way to people's Barber shop and i can say i could not have been happier with the outcome! Even though i gave the lovely woman who was cutting my hair literally no information on what i wanted other than a new hairstyle. She worked her magic and gave me by far my favorite hair cut i have ever received. The entire time i was a nervous wreck yet i knew she was the expert and she fully blew away my expectations. The level of care and attention she paid to my haircut was astounding. You really get the sense that everyone working here loves their job and it's almost as an art for them. As soon as you walk through the door you are greeted promptly and offered a beverage of your choice. luckily they were not booked up and I had absolutely no wait time at all for a walk in. I will be honest the price that we paid i would have gladly paid double if not triple for the haircut i recieved. I only wish i could remember her name but she was very personable and friendly but you could tell her focus was on that of my haircut which i respect and appreciate! I will not get my hair cut any other place than in this location as from the beginning to end i had an amazing experience. Hands down the absolute best overall experience as well as best results i have ever had with a barber shop! If you need a trim or a full new style try peoples you won't be let down! Thank you for taking the time to read my review this was Jonathan E. i hope you enjoy your day and stop in to check out People's it's surely for the people!<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< username>

<Text>They accept walks ins or you can easily book on their website. I’ve done both and had great cuts both times. If you’re a drinker, they offer an alcoholic beverage upon arrival (free of course), and staff are friendly but not too intrusive. You’ll leave styling for sure.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The best Barbershop I've found in San Francisco!

I've been going to People's Barber for about a year now and it's always a great experience. Haircuts to suit any style, amazing staff, relaxing environment and a welcome selection of beers or drinks for guests.

5/5 would recommend to a friend.< /Review>

This place will be around for a long time because the service and skills are out of this world. Ask for Jae! She has hands of gold and she is an expert in her field. I am always impressed with my results. I have been to many people to do my hair but Jae is the most consistent and the most trusted and she can do all types of hair and styles! If you’ve never tried this place before you should hurry because you are missing out!</text>< rate>

This place has the whole package. Ambiance is great, they offer you a drink upon checking in and they give good haircuts. It might be a tad on the pricey side but hey if you want a god haircut you cant complain. Book with Gabrielle B, shes super cool and nice and gives great haircuts.</review>

Jae Concepcion (barber) hooks me up every time. People's is a nice barbershop, complimentary beer and whisky, wifi, they have a beautiful dog running around, and overall nice people. I get my hair washed and a hot towel on my face, it's restorative.

Jae Concepcion is great, thanks for holding me down.</Review>

I had been getting used to that one week period after getting a haircut where your hair had to "settle in" before looking normal again. People's Barber completely eliminates this period and has me comfortable with my hair immediately.

I've mostly gone to Stephanie for the 6-8 months that I've been coming here, but she was booked last week and got a cut with Amy. New barber, exact same attentiveness and precision. I recommend People's to as many of my friends as I can.<//text>< Response>

Dissappinted service - bad communication, no restroom, I was forced to go to the cafe nearby, and when I came back after 10mins. They said they cannot give the full service because each customer only has 30mins time assigned. I ended up leaving.</Text>

<Review>I never plan a haircut more than a day in advance, so I always get someone random, but whoever People's has on staff never disappoints.  Much more chill and accessible than Fellows.

When on time this is a quality service.

Unfortunately for the second time now I have wasted time and money(Parking meter, gas, etc) by making an appointment with peoples on Valencia only to wait until 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment and eventually had to leave without a haircut. When I approached the receptionist with this complaint they said "sorry".

On to the next one.</text>

20mins in and out, very uneven haircut my first time going here. Barber turned me away from the mirror so I could not really see what he was doing, turned the chair back after a bit and for some reason he cut one side of my hair way shorter than the other side, something I did not ask for... also he did not wash or even blow dry my hair after he was done, something I would expect for 50 dollars...

Didn’t fully realize how bad it was until I got home, immediately called to come back in. The person who cut my hair the next day did do a good job and I have been back a few times since, always good. Quality seems to differ among the barbers here.<//Review>

Barber was rushed, got a very short and very uneven haircut. He noticed my hair was uneven and offered to add "product to my hair".  I said "No thanks". he forgets 2 seconds later and adds a bunch if product to my hair.

*** Notices its still uneven and cuts more after adding product.  ***

After washing my hair I've noticed it's a Completely butchered and botched job.  I'll have to wait for this to grow back before I can possibly get it corrected.  Asked to keep long sideburns ended up with almost no sideburns.<//review>

Good vibe and digs in both locations in SF. Stop by the Valencia shop and schedule with David -- great haircut and zero fuss!< /Text>

<Text>Meh. It is all about the stylist. Gina is not good.  Jake is not good. Horgueda is good.  Skeleton crew feeding on the B players not able to get an appointment at fellow.  Robert is great.< /Text>< Response>

<review>My haircut was nice but expensive. The price said $25 for a haircut but it turns out that is for only using a razor and it's $45 if they use scissors. Then after my haircut the guy didn't offer to wash my hair... it probably cost extra<//review><Name>Neil M< /Name>< Resp>

Great vibe, good prices (including the brew or whiskey). Staff turnover might make it hard to get a dependable barber though (thus minus 1 star).<//Review>

Asked for a fairly basic men's haircut and the barber insisted on doing something "less boring". Turned out to be a haircut that didn't really suit me and was a lot more expensive than I wanted to pay.< /text>

Trendy cuts but poor quality customer service. Some of the barbers are rude/pretentious and make it a bad experience.</Text>

The owner/manager was helpful, seemed upfront and honest.  Their prices are reasonable. I got an oil change and smog done in about 45 minutes with no hassles.<//Review>

I highly recommend this locally owned Auto Repair Shop!!! Danny the owner was super helpful and was able to accommodate my needs in less than a day! He originally estimated a $450 repair.... but lucky for me he is an HONEST Mechanic!!! And I only needed a $165 repair! It shows a lot about this place character especially during this pandemic when small businesses are having to close for him NOT to raise the prices! And he wouldn’t accept a tip! Just asked for me to come back for any repair needs!!! Please everyone make this shop your go to repair shop! You won’t be disappointed! Thank you Danny!< /text>

This place was excellent in helping me in a critical situation. I was from out of town and my starter had went out. I needed to get to San Diego. I have a 2010 Mercedes S class and the nearest dealership was in Los Angeles. They were able to return my car to me same day. They even warned me about a leak I had on my car and were genuinely concerned about my being able to make the trip back home. The work was affordable, quick, and efficient. If I lived in the Lancaster/Palmdale area, this would definitely be my goto for auto repairs!</review>

What a great service shop! The owner is super knowledgeable and his shop is super clean! Shop is brand new and the waiting are and garage are all remodeled so it's a breathe of fresh air to bring my car somewhere modern and clean. Brought my car In for an oil change and some maintenance work, highly recommended!< /text>

From error analysis to repairs, simply great.
Danny dealt with my problem quickly.
He even took me for a test drive after he finished work to make sure everything was correct.
Thanks Danny<//Text>

I just needed a simple brake jib done but because I have a 94 Honda accord  they won't work on it cause they won't work on anything before 1996 so if you have an older car dont bother going here<//Review>

<Text>I called today to see if they could look at my 2016Honda Civic because the ac wasn't working. They said go ahead and bring it in. Once I got there they looked it over and refilled the ac and I was out in  about 30mins. My car needs the new R-123 ac refill and no one else was able to do it. They all said I had to take it to the dealer. They made everything simple and easy. They also gave me a great price. I recommend this place for anyone that needs the new R-123 refill on their cars.< /Text><resp>None</resp>< rating>

<response>None< /response><Text>I am a truck driver who had an issue early one morning. I am based in Georgia and had no close resource available to help me. I looked online for anyone with some form of auto/truck repair knowledge. I know that automobiles are their business but they took the time to hear my issue, look it over and yes fix it. I was so relieved. I was able to continue working and not forced to find an alternate course of action. I was pleased with not just the work but the price as well. It's one thing to get good work done, that's hard enough to find, but to get it done by good people is a blessing. If you need auto work done don't hesitate to use Danny and his company. You will see from the way he maintains the repair bays to the hospitality he offers you couldn't have made a better or wiser choice.</Text></record>

Danny from Auto Services was very polite and he knows his stuff. Very responsive, Told me the issue and how much it would be to fix it at a reasonable price. The positive reviews brought me to the shop and there’s a reason why. Thank you everyone from Auto services. Don’t hesitate to call them up.</Text>

<date>1581229331395< /date><text>Danny is by far the best mechanic in town. We have used him throughout the years to service our cars. He is always honest and has never tried to up sell us. Infiniti gave us a $1600 invoice and Danny was able to do the same job for less than half of what we were quoted and my car drives amazing. His shop is also very nice and clean. I would definitely recommend his services if you are looking for an honest mechanic!<//text>< Response>

These guys saved our lives on a coast to coast car trip. They were swift, efficient, polite, and very affordable. They solved the problem and had us on the road inside 6 hours. I was very pleasantly surprised at the final bill.< /Text>

Needed a new mechanic as my car was having issues. These guys are very professional and have a clean shop. They had my car back to me very quickly by the time stated. I could definitely trust my car here and recommend this shop to anyone. It’s good to have a high quality mechanic shop here in the AV.</Text>

Even brought me a cool drink from their fridge while I was waiting. Shop is brand new, new equipment, even the floors are new. Gave me a grest deal on labor costs as well. Definitely recommend them.

Our first time coming here and absolutely loved it. Very clean place and delicious food. I’m not sure which plate was my favorite! I definitely recommend trying the chocolate dessert. The staff was super friendly and Covid compliant. We will 100% be back.< /text>

Very poor service, very rude talking.
If you want to have a good time, this is not the place.
Very long service time.
The food is good, traditional.

<text>Not a long wait on a Fri night. Server was very helpful in explaining everything. Food was good. I would have found some of the dishes rather bland but they do supply you with soy, vinegar and chili oil to flavor it the way you want. Decent selection of non alcoholic beverages and boba. Didn't try the desserts but did have a good selection of traditional bao.<//text>< rating>

<gmapID>0x80dd4b2bbcf466fb:0x5b772d325bf8610e</gmapID><review>** Review based on Outside Dinning **

overall i do not have good experience with outside dinning at this location.  But it won' t be fair to give them "" 2 "" stars, because of the pandemic.  The food is still decent; just the surrounding is horrible.

Firstly, you have to make reservation on Yelp; i guess you can't just walk-in and wait for available table.  Once you have checked in at your time slot; staff will walk you to your table; and explained to you, no cash is accepted.  Then,  "waiting" is part of package.
we sat about 10min until our server came to greet us; because he so busy from bring dishes to other customer from the kitchen; which its about 5 min walk away from the outdoor dinning area.
after we have placed the order, we have received clean bowl, plate and utensil, less than drinking cup.  waited another good 5 min for "water jug", plus another 5 min for clean glass.
the server is way too busy "travelling" between "kitchen" & serve.  some dishes were cold by the time gets to our table.

next time i would rather just "pick up" the food, instead dine at the ourdoor seating.<//review>< pictures>

I love Din Tai Fung. The food is always good. And the service is always great too. Of all the locations, Del Amo is my favorite. The wait times are reasonable; unlike the hours of waiting at the South Coast location. My favorite dish is the sesame noodles – with a bit of the spicy sauce added on top.< /Review>

<Review>This place is overall AMAZING the prices were cheap meanwhile the food was esquisite.  You would think it was hundreds of dollars but it was only a few for the such amazing food.  And the servings were realistic.  The customer service was soooooo nice and sweet.  Plus there is to-go.  This place was MIND BLOWING.  Trust me there is a reason for the wait it's home-made.  The greenbeans and dumpling are a must-have.  The greenbeans are perfectly seasoned and after we ate dumplings we were so happy and soothed.  Amazing expierince.  Will come here again.  DEFINITLEY RECOMEND< /Review>< Rating>

Surprisingly, well organized separate ordering line and pickup line within the mall. The only thing is NO CASH, credit only; not even Samsung, Google, or Apple Pay available. If you spend $125 or more, you get a nice reusable Din Tai Fung bag. I only spent $80, but man, I feel like that was enough to get one of those bags! The food was delicious as always.<//review>

< Review>
Totally worth it! We went in just before the dinner rush and man we were happy we did. We came to celebrate my brother's promotion for his work. The staff were all incredibly friendly and super understanding. We had 3 kids and a large party so we got a special room. We loved it, private affair for us. I will be coming back soon. If you have never been here just follow the server's instructions and don't be afraid to try new things. We pretty much ordered a little bit of everything on the menu and we were amazed. The only thing we didn't order were soups which looked super good by the way. I recommend their popular dishes that are the first items on the menu. They have a full bar as well so don't be hesitate on the drinks. Loved it, great place overall.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This is the best place for dumplings. The fried rice is really simple, but tasty. The pork dumplings in the “spicy” sauce are not spice at all; however, you cannot get enough because their flavor is mouthwatering.
Yelp can help you to reserve a table and avoid the waiting. In weekends it’s extremely crowded, you might need to wait.
The green tea is weird. I don’t find it good at all because it’s a mixture of green and jasmine tea.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmM7GmrCs_LauWjSCWJ1AWC4SJU5yMfvSam9aP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1EAz5wVa3P5hkzU5ujpW8xoweUXeIv3vP57fR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgXjnCTwxvKcox5EBrl5H8RUKje_Tkltd8A2Cx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPcHTjv66rzpSsASEdG_RnFYJrXmkkpA3W4B7P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgEFjV2MqR9vKEQkYf68YLqkxI-DW_eig7huay=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuQQhqiLRjSYWQfoWvt9NT7-FeNL0vhGJ492a0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLGyThX5umuzD0-1xj4PjQFtVLi2Q-5j9RruuL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8-tZNPmRafOiYnyJ43VTliiLXBZqQmEEhM8Hd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZQdenZOkDqBQJx_EjeevcGT7Jjo-hbG_R_iIH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOXYuqRg3blJ_3tmggaq4_gVUmukGjOg0ZizYG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>I ordered the shrimp and pork wonton soup. It was only wontons, broth and green onion. I asked where are the vegetables. They said no that is a different soup. The noodle soup I had to order, if I wanted vegetables. I asked for the wonton soup with the veggies that come in the shrimp noodle soup. They said no, they can’t do that. Then I said well I want the shrimp noodle soup without the noodles and a side of wontons. They  said no. They said they  can’t give me veggies in my wonton soup or wonton in my veggie soup. This makes no sense to me and I still don’t understand it. I mean they can put wontons and or noodles on the side and not in the soup, so U don’t understand their logic for not letting me get at least wontons on the side, especially since they are a famous dumping place. Whatever, I can’t wrap my head around it. So I had to order 2 soups one without the noodles, just to get create 1 normal soup. Although it was tasty, it still wasn’t a typical wonton soup flavor. The broth was clean and that was good,. The broth didn’t taste like a eal wonton soup broth. The noodles, I am glad I ordered them in the side, because they have no flavor and just taste like raw dough. The soups combined made a good wonton soup, but nothing was authentic and it cost too much, to combination 2 soups in order to experience  one semi close match to what I wanted. The flavors were good, but nothing was authentic. Nothing blew me away. The broth tasted more like my chicken noodle soup broth, than an authentic wonton soup  broth. Yes good, not authentic, too pricey, just not very exciting or great. It was very average and nothing above average.I am not impressed and will not go back.< /Text>< pictures>

Absolutely love this place! First time here for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My table for 3 was at the windows into the mall making it fun for people watching while munching. We started with find drinks - slushees and milk teas with boba and they were all delicious. We had several dishes including the one pictured here which was our favorite - spicy pork and shrimp dumplings. Would definitely recommend and am looking forward to returning again!<//Review>

Why I didn’t know about this place earlier? It’s a gem ❤️ loved their menu. I’ll most definitely be back and keep on discovering more items. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. They have some amazing food! The staff was very friendly and attentive. Explained all the processes and was there to answer any questions. Eugenia was the lady in charge of me ;) thank you once again for great experience!</review>

<Text>Online ordering and curbside pickup super seamless. The takeaway soup dumplings are definitely not the same as eating in person, but given the circumstances, they did a pretty great job still! Pickup feels super safe and all the packaged food were tidy and clean. Spicy wontons always 👌🏻.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Took my family here for my father's birthday and they loved it.  I would suggest to make a reservation like we did because we came for dinner on a friday and there was what looked like an hour long line. The quality of the food was exceptional and the service was as well. Our server was barryl and she provided excellent service.< /review>

<Review>Honestly I think the foods were good but overrated. The crab meat dumplings were good and have a very neat presentation, but they tasted a bit “fishy”, barely warm and dried. The dumplings looked and tasted like they  had been sitting in the kitchen for a while. The sticky rice with pork was tasty but small. The beef noodle soup was a disappointment due to its poor presentation and water down soup. The beef was ok, definitely I have had better. The beef noodle was just average. The service was great, very friendly staff.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrldPR1CUYW3izOEf_Do6kpAOjfLWXpJCRoPo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkh8jXnaMdrT7iyldhCHJ4bx5P9WseIyacOZ4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4GM1Q8-r39ABswsV-SzCOvJZ44x_bDzBisr0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsCBY7EG6IDW1v6ZWbh7FD-H6zpqtcX_B9rXM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4n0ZVYGhXeoGYYDUGe1VO9Gs3a9pZUB-u3eY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5i3JMlFijPkTh-H2VY9kjI4Rsxzx-4-m_GrY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC2bG4Se2o9mEQV5QmD2wMEOXFYr-M20Nyl4k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Their food is good but the reservations are horrible all they have are 645-745pm reservations available nothing in the afternoon. No flexibility at all. Would rate it less but gave it 2 stars because their food is worth the hype.</Review>

They appear to have a steady flow of customers, so highly unlikely to get a table unless you arrive to start the line before they open or find a seat at the bar. Service is consistent throughout the entire chain of restaurants and they are always efficient.<//Review>< Rate>

Always have a great time at Din Tai Fung at Del Amo. Make sure to reserve a place in line on Yelp first - if not, you can get some shopping done while you wait.  The chocolate bao are the best.  Very toddler friendly too.<//Text>

THE BEST Taiwanese Restaurant EVER! Saw the huge line night before and decided to eat here for lunch today. I'm not usually a big fan of Asian cuisine, but I am after eating here!

Was greeted by every staff member while being seated and our server, Anh, explained everything from the menu to how to make the dumpling sauce. Her favorite menu items became mine as well. When in town, you MUST come here. Highly suggest making reservations.<//text>

Absolutely love this place, from the experience of watching them make the dumplings fresh to their variety of appetizers, vegetarian and meat entrees and mouth watering desserts. Been here so many times, its a little pricey but worth it for an unforgettable night out.<//Review>

What a great place! Conveniently located in the mall. They do tend to have a wait, but that's ok.. Just shop while you wait! (use Yelp nowait to be added on the list and skip the line) They have Boba drinks and tasty Asian food! A must try when you are at the mall.</Review>

Nice setting inside the mall. You need to place your order yourself on a slip. Huge percentage of plates are pork or have pork components in them.< /text>

If you’ve never eaten here you’ve already wasted time. Go now. They have the most delicious food, especially dumplings. Sometimes there’s a wait- do yourself a favor and wait it out. There’s plenty of shopping or browsing to do in the meantime. Last time I was there they were opening a japanese cheesecake place across the way. Try that too.</Review>

If you love dumplings you won't be disappoint.  Went there to meet my family members I have not seen in awhile.  You definitely have to wait for awhile before they sell seat you.  Once you are call they direct you to the windows where the kitchen staffs are making dumplings.  You just can't wait to be seated after watching them making dumplings through the window.  Once we sat down we just order a dozen here and dozen there.  Noodles are very tasty also.  Next I'm in LA I will definitely go back again.<//text>

I thought the food here was quite amazing. With my sister we tried the Pork & Crab Xiao Long Bao. They were great! Out of the two I recommend the Pork. Also had the pork wonton with spicy sauce and that one took the show for me. Can't go wrong here!< /review>

<text>I think that it's a bit overpriced.
But I love the foods. Dumplings are so good. Beef soup is interesting but great after all.
Staffs are nice and kind.
This restaurant is so popular. It's stressful to wait a lot.
So I prefer TO GO.</text>< pics>

The food was good, and the service was exceptional. I had the pork and crab dumplings, veggie fried rice, and chicken noodles. I'll definitely come back, but only when it's not so busy.<//text>

<review>$95 before tips. Three people. Dim Sum. Sunday.

Go to place for brunch with the family. Lots of other toddlers dining out here.

The acoustics have room for improvement. It tends to get loud.

Love this location.  Good shopping. Uniqlo and Co. In case, you need to change your clothing size after all the yummy food at DTF.

Ping me for any additional questions. I am happy to help.

<review>Haven't been back in almost a year and the quality and customer service are still as top notch as I remember! Very impressed with how they're handling the new guidelines we all have to follow now. The paper on the table with dinning instructions was easy to follow and neat to use. The food was to die for, everything we ordered came in a timely fashion and all the necessary sauces/condiments were provided either beforehand at the table or arrived quickly at special request. The dumplings were delicious and came in large portions which are great for person partys. The only downsides I can think of is you have to make a reservation though Yelp since they no longer allow walk ups, but even that is quick and easy, and that it is a pricey meal. However, I do believe the quality of the food makes up for that.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b2bbcf466fb:0x5b772d325bf8610e</Gmap_id><rating>5<//rating><Name>Mariana Padilla<//Name>< Time>

<Text>The food was amazing! The flavors were delicate and the portion sizes were decent for the price. The dumplings did not disappoint and the pork chops were crispy and moist and the rice being nice and fluffy. The staff really adhered to the Covid regulations. They were constantly cleaning and making sure they stayed a fair distance away from you except for when serving and even then they were quick to drop off your food and leave.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>Couldn't believe that there was already a line with an hour long wait just after 11am. It's pretty sweet that you receive a text when your table is ready. Went shopping for a bit and our wait time was just a tad shy of 1 hour. Once we ordered, the food started to come out fast and furious! The servers were friendly and they all worked as a team. I enjoyed everything we ordered. I will definitely be back!</Text>< Rating>

Still the best place for soup dumplings and related food!!  Service is friendly and efficient.  Sometimes the wait seems to be excessively long for items to come out as they bring them as they are ready, but overall it is a great experience from food to service to atmosphere.< /review>

Waiters know how to accommodate parties even our first visit; knowledgeable. Not a dim sum person but was actually good. Dim sum is always expensive though so I wouldn’t say this place is far from other pricings ($11-14 a plate).< /review>

Authentic Chinese cuisine. My first time was at the Arcadia location and I enjoyed their Dumplings. Today my fiancee & I sampled their sauteed kale, pork/kimchee, and vegetable dumplings, shrimp fried rice, finally fried noodles with chicken (lo-mein style). Everything was delicious.
Service was great, atmosphere superb, very organized and professional. We even suggested a few items on the menu to a couple guests that had arrived just as we were departing. I gave a five star rating.<//Text>

<Date>1584671255599< /Date><text>This place has a special place in my foodie heart because it's technically my first Michelin-rated restaurant and I got to share it with my close friends that have never had dim sum before. When I first told them about it and that it was at the Del Amo Mall, they looked at me with an odd look, but trusted my judgement and are now hooked on dim sum. What I like about this place is that you're able to get some high quality dim sum without having to break the bank. It's a little bit of wait, but it's affordable and delicious! I recommend making reservations or using the Yelp app to secure your place in line.

They are known for their soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), but everything else is also done very well too. If you never had dim sum before, I recommend getting a variety of dumplings including wontons in spicy sauce, pot stickers, steamed buns, and their soup dumplings of course. It's easy to share and you'll figure out what you will like best. Dim sum is kind of like the Asian version of tapas, but is geared towards morning/afternoon and is usually accompanied with hot tea. Hope you like this place as much as I do!</text><userid>110545043251394065521< /userid>< Rate>

The service here is very good and the interior is very cozy and neat.
Of course the food here is very yummy with low price.
Beef noodle is really yummy here.
But definitely Pork XiaoLongBao in Taiwan is much more delicious than here.
Anyway it’s worth to the price.< /Review>

Food is good. But I thought It would have more flavor. But it was good. Their spicy sauce is actually not spicy. Staff is great.

Best service I've ever received at any DTF and I've received consistent good service before. If you're eating here you have to order the pork soup dumplings (Xao Long Bao) it's what they're famous for. Other notable favorites are the wontons in spicy sauce, beef noodle soup, pork chop, try fried rice or rice cakes. Can't go wrong with anything on this menunreally.< /Review>

<Text>The pork dumplings for the best and our what this place is famous for, and it's well deserved. I thought the beef stew was a really great surprise, and it's rarely done well. The broth was rich without being oily, the beef was super tender. The spicy dumplings we're great and the rice cake with chicken is perfect for kids.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b2bbcf466fb:0x5b772d325bf8610e< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I was a huge fan of Din Tai Fung back in Asia and still am. This place is one of the best Din Tai Fung in terms of service, food and location. From the time my friend and i arrived, i felt good vibe already cos the hostess was super nice explaining how the table reservation work and answering my questions. It was about less than 30 min i got text message to go back to restaurant. There was a friendly guy who greeted us when we were back for the table. Our server, Nick + Stephan, and others were attentive, nice and fast.
Let’s talk about the food, here’s what we had...
- Xiao Long Bao/Soup Dumplings, it’s a must :)
- Shrimp & Pork Wonton Soup + additional egg noodles (so yummy if you add chili oil from table)
- Shrimp Pork Pot Stickers (Crispy & tasty)
- Noodles with Mince Pork.
- Red Bean Bun & Sesame Bun (they’re so good but you need to order earlier cos it takes 15 min to be ready).
I definitely will be back soon :)</Review>

Believe the hype. It's real. This sleek, contemporary dumpling house serves delicious Pork Xiao Long Bao, vinegary Cucumber Salad, and fresh noodles with their signature spicy sauce that I can never get enough of. Don't come too hungry, it takes a loooooooong time to get a table (minus one star) although we had no wait for brunch hour (11-11:45 am) on week days.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Din Tai Fung is a must have for people visiting the area. I have been here twice now as I live in the SF Bay Area and each time it does not dissappoint.  I have tried most everything on the menu, each item comes with tons of flavor.  The shredded pork fried rice is tastes very lite.  The dumplings are epic and juicy.  If you haven't tried you need too - highly reccommend!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-juLFgeZFJJzRlzaB6W4VddfOzWF8IFIx7awh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJvnum_cd8R6RxX3LENSeTon1qNfz-BunJ5903=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPgOpdv2dAgC-tpdCU-9heNKhZdSGxoKZXWA2Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I visit this outstanding restaurant from time to time since I love the ambiance that is exist in this place. The crew is highly friendly and experienced. The service is very efficient. Also, the food they cook is first-rate. I frequent often and I was always joyful. The payment is modest. I recommend this place to to all.< /Review>

The best pork soup dumplings in LA, if not the world. Din Yai Fung is famous, with a Michelin star to their name, and rightfully so. Their dumplings are phenomenal. We had a variety of dumplings this time and all of them were great. My favorite will always be the soup dumplings. So much flavor and great tasting meat inside.<//review>

Hidden gem inside a mall. If you go during dinner time there is a wait we were quoted a 45-65 min wait but actual time was about 35. You check in to get your name on the list and you give your phone number. You receive one text letting you know your in the system and the second text they send you check in get a menu and are seated within 10ish minutes. Even though there was a wait you can tell that they have a system down to move people along.<//review>

Still the best place for soup dumplings and related food!!  Service is friendly and efficient.  Sometimes the wait seems to be excessively long for items to come out as they bring them as they are ready, but overall it is a great experience from food to service to atmosphere.<//Text>

Absolutely lives up to the hype! Stop wandering around town for dumplings and come here for the fresh, authentic, good stuff! The parking is ample and free. It's centrally located in the mall on the second level. Usually long lines during peak hours but that's what you would expect considering the tasty flavors served here. Very good service as well. Enjoy!<//Text>

The food was incredible. I had never been here before, but we ordered a big spread and all 5 of us were content! The dumplings were the star of the show, but nothing we ordered disappointed us! However, we had very clear instructions at check out that we needed extra utensils and extra sauces, and none were provided.<//Review>

Great food & very good service. Only downside is it's very busy & you can't reserve a table & don't forget to wear sweatpants, you will need them or just unbutton your tight jeans.</Text>

< Review>
Venue - Modern and clean.

Service - Great service from our waiter during lunch time and friendly staff.

Food - Very fresh but small portions if your hungry.

Prices - A tad bit higher than other places, but the taste and freshness is worth it.

Parking - At the mall so its a pain.

Overall great experience will be back and recommend it.<//Review>

My girlfriend and I will come to the mall two-three times a month specifically to eat here. We've yet to find something on the menu that we don't enjoy. The ribs were the dish that surprised us the most. If there's a line, just wait. It's worth it.<//Text>

Love that Din Tai Fung opened at my local mall 4/5 years ago. Having this location definitely helped me convert some of the trips that I usually make to South Coast Plaza. And definitely makes Del Amo Fashion Center a must-stop destination for travelers to the Los Angeles area.</review>

My friend hyped this place up, and it was worth the experience. The decor was really cool. The wait wasn't bad, but there were two of us, and they wouldn't let me sit until my friend showed.

The service was great, but the food could have been better. The Veggie and Pork Dumplings with the Spicy Sauce and the Wood Ear Mushrooms were the best things that we had.</Review>

Great dumplings and noodles. The chocolate dumplings sound odd but definitely get them!</Text>

Yes it is a bit pricey and there are other places where you can get similar dishes but the consistent quality, good dishes beyond the soup dumplings, and high quality staff service makes Din Tai Fung a definite must try for soup dumplings, especially if you've never tried. Set in the new wing of del amo mall, DTF is centrally located with a lot of space out front... Because there are long lines. It is very popular and gets very crowded, so get there early and reserve your spot!</Review>

<Review>If you haven't heard about this, please check it out.  Asian dumplings pushed farther than I've ever seen! Even a dumpling with soup on the inside (lord knows how). Dishes that you've never seen before can be hard to choose from, but the helpful staff guides you through the menu and makes suggestions--even when eating at the bar.  Tip: if you are a small party with no children, skip the wait list like business travelers do: ask the hostess if you can eat at the bar.< /Review>< Pics>

I always see long lines for this restaurant and now I know why. Food execution is superb, everything tasted good. I had very high expectations for their Xiao long bao since that is what they are known for but to be honest, despite it being good I've had better elsewhere hence the 1 star deduction. Other than that, the spicy wonton was amazing, green bean with garlic was great, porkchop fried rice was delicious. Service was excellent and the restaurant ambiance was perfect. I would definitely come back here for more.< /text>

Things here are good. Only difference this one from the Taipei one is the amount of salt they use here. Stick to the dumplings. The noodles are way too salty.<//text>

You will never see Chinese food at the mall the same ever again after eating here.

There are no heat lamps, chaffing trays, or a worker passing out free samples here. Din Tai Fung as a corporate chain now brings to the mall gourmet fine dining delicacies at fine dining prices to boot.

Famous are the juicy pork/soup dumplings that have claimed fame. Xie Long Bao is what we are talking about and Din Tai Fung does it the best in the market right now at an astonishing pace with teams of workers in behind a fishbowl. Of course, there are many other very tasty items on the menu also. Actually, this location like all others carries the same menu and consistency of quality and taste reign the land.

You really can't go wrong with almost all their dumpling selections, but I do tend to stay away from the seafood. Pair your meal with some noodles and string beans and you'll be satisfied.

Unfortunately, the wait times at this popular location is staggering. Expect a possible one hour wait on weekends and maybe more during certain popular hours. Also, if you aren't already aware, this is fine dining even though it is at the mall. Do expect a $30 ticket for each person if you're visiting casually, and $40 per person if you're hungry.< /Text>

Din Tai Fung is one of those crave-worthy restaurants. Every dish that is served tastes fresh, with clean flavors and the right amount of filling in each dumpling. Being high volume, the restaurant is run extremely efficitently, and the staff is extremely friendly. Because of the volume, there are times that you might get lost in the crowd and if might take a few minutes to find your server if you need something, but once you do, they are prompt in getting you anything you might need.</text>

Everything was so yummy and fresh! One of the cleanest dumpling houses I have ever been to. The attention to detail was superb  and the seasoning of the food was perfect - not too salty, or bland.<//Text>

<Review>PARKING: very limited, mostly bank parking. I wouldn't drive all the wait out here for theses.

FOOD:
Dumplings - Not all the dumplings are fully cooked, the buns are still...doughy. I was excited to try the taro dumplings, and that what happened to me. I only liked the pork dumplings, one order = ten dumplings
Fried rice - Tasteless
Chinese broccoli- Same as any dim sum place

SERVICE: Took 15 minutes to even put our order in. And server spilled drinks ... *thumbs down* The wait itself was so long, being that the food sucks, NOT WORTH IT.</Review>< Pics>

Amazing dumplings and rice cakes. Also all the green veggies are delicious. I always go for the vegetarian options, which can be bland in some places, but here you can not go wrong.</Text>

Amazing food. Try the soup dumplings, pork fried rice, any of the vegetables, they won't disappoint. The wait takes a while so go at opening or you may have to wait a while. it's worth the wait and there's a wait for a reason.</Text>

Pandemic UPDATE: 9-1-20 Order curbside pickup or, starting today, they have a tent in the parking lot on the west (Hawthorne) side of the mall to dine in (see pics). Curbside pickup is the small white tent next to the dine-in tent. Place your order directly on the restaurant website since the other services take part of the restaurant's money. End Update.
Best Dim Sum in the south Bay. Arrive before you are hungry and plan on a minimum of 30-45 min wait. Can be up to 2 hours.

They will text when your table is ready so just wait in the que for the hostess in the middle. Return to the podium on the right when you get your page. Expect 10-15 min more of a wait when you return.

Hot Tip: grab an open chair at the full service bar if one is available. No wait list, just stand-up for an opening.< /Text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>Nice and elegant dinner. I was not wowed by some of the dumplings. But I'm a salt and acid lover. These celebrate the ingredients as they are. I also ordered noodles in spicy sauce and wontons in spicy sauce and loved them. We also tried the shrimp fried noodles and those where good. Either way I will try again to get some more variety.< /Text>< Pictures>

Such a treat to always stop by Din Tai Fung. This restaurant tends to be a crowdpleaser when I bring my out-of-town guests here because I've never had a bad experience and the food is always top quality. The wholesome family style eating environment is comfortable and preferred over many other similar dining spaces. The interior design of this place is really chic and interesting because the sleek black and tan design seems to be a fusion of traditional and modern Taiwanese culture. Retrofitted with a bar area, there's plenty of seating and they can host large groups easily.< /Review>

Although I was initially feeling a lot of guilt when I saw the food prep people working at a fevered pitch in the window; that quickly turned into gratitude when we enjoyed the fruits of their labor.   The restaurant manager actually sat with us to walk us through the menu,  add this was our first visit.   Phenomenal food and much appreciated service.</review>

Expect a wait. If you have a small party that's all over 21, then sit at the bar to avoid the wait. Dumplings so good and worth the hype.  I'm all about the pork soup dumplings, the pork and kimchi dumplings, and any of the wontons in spicy sauce. Surprisingly good cocktail menu with some unique choices. Overall worth the hype. Will ruin other dumplings for you.< /Text>

As other location does they have great selection of chinese food. Especially this location has nice interior with lots of skylights.

As I always do we ordered dim sum, sesame noodle and xialongbao, and they were all great</Text>

<Review>Lots and lots of crowds all time, because its sooooo yummy. Dumplings are their thing, but nearly everything on the menu is tasty. Service is quick, food is hot and turnover is constant...they need the tables for the next group....no leisurely lunches here!!! That's ok, the food is too yummy, that you'll eat to much and then get up to walk it off around the mall.<//Review><name>Helen DeArmon</name>< response>

The best ever!! If you're in Oahu this place is a must! The service was impeccable.  Our server was Emily and she was phenomenal!!! She helped to describe the dishes we inquired about and went on to make her own suggestions.  The food was so on point,  so many different flavors,  it was phenomenal.  Loved every minute of it!</text>

<Text>We always enjoy coming here. The wait can be long but they send you a text message when your table is ready.  Food is excellent. Haven't had a bad or even an average dish here. Service is good. I like that the tables are not jammed together.</Text>< pics>

The amount of combinations of different types of delicious food is amazing, and the speed at which food reaches you is great.

Very delicious food. There is always a wait. You have to get there early or just put your name down and go shop. The food is very good but very very very expensive compared to similar items at different restaurants. Be prepared to pay a lot. The food portions could be a little bigger. But overall very delicious!< /Review>

<Text>Not our favorite Din Tai Fung, we came in with expectation of a lot better quality and flavor. We got their famous soup dumplings and even that was mediocre. The rice cakes stir fry was also an option and for some reason it just tasted really doughy.. I know they can be better because I've had better. But this was a bit disappointing.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Came here at noon on a Wednesday, so there was no wait. We had: regular pork xiao long bao, shrimp and pork wontons with spicy sauce, tofu puff and glass noodle soup with pork, and truffle and pork xiao long bao! The wontons in spicy sauce were the best of the 4 dishes.<//Review>

Other than the wait it's always a great fast experience. The new ribs and the cold noodle salad are exceptional.  Of course you can't pass up the soup dumplings,  they are very delicious. If you can call in and just make a reservation to be able to just walk right in then everything is golden.</Text>

Not cheap. But worth it. Small plates. Between myself and the wife we had five plates.  The Pork steamed bun and the dessert target black sesame bun were the usual hit of the show. The garlic steamed  spinach, Woodear mushroom and shrimp/pork spicy wonton finished the lunch</review>

<text>This place is always crowded for a reason. Delicious xiao long bao and food in general. The wait can be awhile, but they have a system where they can text you when your table is ready. You can also RSVP in advance online as well. It's moderate to high for prices... party of 2 for dinner for me would run $50+ so I don't come as often as I would like to.< /text>< pics>

We tried the noodles, several different dumplings and a bun. Everything was good, but the dumplings are definitely the way to go. They are hot, juicy, delicious treats. Oh and we had the steamed veggies, while they are good, they are extremely overpriced. Small portion for a hefty price for simple steamed veggies.</review></record>

First time here after going to the mall every weekend I go, Passing by I always wondered how good it is it's always busy. So I gave it a chance today with my wife & kids. I'm Hispanic not does that matter just something different to eat. Waited about 20 min But the service was A+. Food was really good I'll be back soon we had a great time there. Always good to eat new things.< /review>

Who doesn't love soup dumplings? The food here is good, but I do feel that it's become more "Americanized".<//text>

<Review>Do not give this place money!! Checked in at 4:30ish to see if they could accommodate a party of 10 and asked about the private room for dinner later. They said sure no problem just let us know when everyone is here. Checked back in (new hostess) at 5:30pm and she checked with her people and again confirmed that we could have the room as soon as everyone was there. Cut to 15-20 minutes later and they are seating us but walked us to the main room. I asked if the private room was no longer available? She said oh, there was another party asking for it but they didn't put a deposit down so technically it's 1st come 1st served so sure. They can seat us in there in 5 minutes. We said if it was just 5 minutes, we could wait but if it was a problem we would just sit and eat since we had hungry kids that had been waiting over an hour. She said no worries, 5 minutes. We patiently waited 15-20 minutes at the front before a manager came to talk to us saying he was sorry for any miscommunication but he was going to give the room to another party that had called. By this time the restaurant was full! We had to find somewhere else. Please, please don't patronize this business!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Very nice upscale looking location. Servers were well trained, very friendly, informative. Food was great. Since it's in the mall, plenty of parking spots. Maybe little hard for elderly people since you need to walk some diatance to get there. My only complain was that they don't do "half and half", but other than that, I liked this place. will go back again.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

<Text>When we dined in here, it felt like it was my first time eating soup dumplings. Everything was amazing! We tried pork, pork and shrimp, and the truffles and they are all so good. I must say though that I don;t think that the truffle is worth the price. It's 5 for $22.50 (if I remember correctly). But if it's your first time here, you should go and get it. IMO, I think all the other soup dumplings are just equally as delicious! And as your resident boba milk tea girl, I have to say that their milk teas is on my top 10. It was so creamy.< /Text><date>1490111104584<//date>< response>

Hot and sour soup. Lost one star. Did not have a classic taste, bland, and not enjoyable.

Pork and shrimp pot stickers- Great with sauce.
Pork Bun- the pork was delicious and flavorful.
Fried noodles with chicken. Great with a touch of pepper.

I will definitely return.</Review>< pics>

really a solid place.  there is hype, but it is deserved.  would i go out of my way to eat here again?  yes, but only if there weren't some insane wait.

happened to go to this location when i was on a break doing two shifts in the area, so i tried it with a coworker.  the dumplings are great, and the sauteed string beans are out of this world.

if you don't know the menu, ask the server and they will guide you.<//text>

<Review>For my first time here, it took me forever to be taken care of and by the time my family got their food the server forgot to put my order in and I had to remind her where was my plate and still had to wait. I got my plate right when everyone was almost done eating & she didn't apologize she acted like it wasn't her mistake. Bad Service.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>I'm a big dumplings fan and I was not disappointed! Had a great variety and all we're pretty solid. The kimchee pork one was probably my least favorite as the kimchee definitely over powered the flavor. Also the chicken soup was very weak. Stick to the dumplings and I doubt you will walk out unhappy. Pretty big place but I hear the wait can be quite long. We went early for dinner on a Tuesday and got straight in. I will definitely be looking out for these guys again.<//Review>< userid>

I’ve been to this Din Tai Fung twice now, and both times the service was absolutely outstanding. The food matched the service as well. I️ suggest going with a large group of people if possible, and ordering a variety of dumplings, rice, and vegetable sides to share. This way you get to sample all the incredible flavors and get the most bang for your buck. I️ had never eaten dumplings prior to my first visit, but both times I️ left completely satisfied and looking forward to my next visit to Din Tai Fung.</Review>

The service here is quick and the food is to die for. I said to my mom "if I had all the money in the world and am always empty stomach, I'd spend the rest of my life here."
The inside is modern and beautiful, the ambiance is kept up with amazing music and helpful servers. Everyone is so nice and the meals are total heaven.<//text>

Ding Tai Feng is really for carb lovers, almost everything here is carbs! And that's why we never eat at any Ding Tai Feng restaurants because of gluten sensitivities and I am on low carb very often. Hubby really wanted to try this location at Del Amo in Torrance so I went along with him just this time!

We came in for a late lunch, had a couple drinks at the full bar while waiting for sister and her bf. The Hendrick's soda water and lime was a bit weak, but hubby's Grey Goose dry martini was very yummy. Menu was huge with almost all Chinese carbs items like dumplings, buns, dry noodles, wontons, noodle soups, fried rice, pot stickers, shao mai and more. They even had sweet dumplings as desserts. They do have limited vegetarian, vegan and gluten free items but they are just veggies and some rice items so they are supposed to be naturally gluten free?

After our waitress' detailed introduction of the menus, we decided on a few orders of their famous juicy kurobuta pork dumpling / xiao long bao, cod fish dumplings, kimchi & pork dumplings, shrimp & kurobuta pork pot stickers, spicy chicken wonton, sautéed mustard greens with shredded ginger, braised beef soup, chicken wonton soup, shrimp fried rice and chocolate & mochi XLB. The food was really delicious without MSG and not greasy at all. Everybody loved xiao long bao so we got more orders of just those. The other dumplings were yummy but not nearly as good as juicy pork XLB. Shrimp fried rice was the best I've ever had. I think it's better to just order XLB with soup, veggies and fried rice. That way you can have a more balanced meal than a whole bunch of different dumplings in my opinion. We had San Pellegrino and a few more Grey Goose martinis as beverages.

The service was top notch which was what we expected from an upscale Chinese restaurant. If you love dumplings you should really try Ding Tai Feng and you will enjoy it very much. For me it's a once in a long time thing cause I am still having headaches from all the gluten I ignored for this meal!</text>

Saw this restaurant on a video on social media and had to try it. The wait was less than 10 minutes and the food was delicious. Highly recommend spending the money and trying the truffle xiaolongbao it was incredible! The staff was friendly and explained the menu to us since it was our first time. They also have amazing boba tea</review>

Great dumplings! Came for lunch and ordered string beans/garlic, shrimp & pork dumplings, pork fried rice and for dessert chocolate mochi dumpling. Everything was delicious and fresh. Get there early if not you will be waiting for a seat.</text>

The food was good, but there were a few things that kept it from being great. The spicy sauce for wontons in spicy sauce wasn't actually spicy. The soup dumplings themselves were just shy of being salted enough, and the skins tasted a bit too much of flour. The broth for the beef noodle soup wasn't spiced assertively enough; it was as if someone took plain beef broth and added extra flavors right before serving. On the whole, the meal was good, but it definitely doesn't merit the Michelin star its menu brags its other location earned.<//review>

Food was great, servers were great but the wait was insane. We were told 30 minutes, an hour later we got a text. Then waited in one line about 7 minutes, and then another line to be seated for 15-20 minutes. Finally got to the table and my kid falls asleep.

Side note, apparently they allow dogs in the bar area at least. So, if your trying to drink inside the mall with your dog, they didn't make them leave... so....</text>

<review>I've eaten at three or four DTF locations at least, both in and out of California.  The Santa Anita Mall and Torrance locations are my local haunts.   In each location the food is always exceptional.  The staff are well-trained and always are pleasant and efficient.   The management do a fine job keeping service and food quality to high standards.

When you order try to balance your meal with one of the lighter dishes at the front of the menu.  And order a green (they're great).  The soups are all quite good, and the dumplings ... well that's why one goes.  The xiao lin bao and spicy shrimp abd pork dumplings are musts if it's your first time.

This is a very successful chain and they are unfailingly busy.  You might have to wait if you try to dine at peak times.<//review>< pics>

Great place for traditional dumplings and some of the best I have had. Also, really loved the cucumber salad appetizer at this restaurant and would highly recommend that and all of the dumplings along with anything else on the menu except those that follow: hot and sour, braised beef noodle soups, shrimp & kurobuta pork pot stickers, shredded pork fried rice, and vegetable & kurobuta pork wontons with spicy sauce were lacking in flavor and definitely avoid those.< /review>

<Review>I LOVE!

Get all the food. The greens the noodles the buns the dumplings the everything.

You make the sauce with soy sauce and vigager get a good ratio going and then add that spicy sauce. Mmmmmm I’m drooling thinking about it

This location is great. We waited 15-20 minutes. You have to arrive and put your name in. you can’t call ahead and make a reservation. Well worth it tho. The one at the south coast plaza is an easy 2 hour wait. Your whole party has to be there by the time you get to sit down.</Review><Name>Melissa Gilleard< /Name></record>

Food is not as good as before, service was horrible, wrong item delivered, veggie dish came in too late with the dessert!! Really! Also we were waiting for red bean dumpling for more than 15 minutes!!  They have this order from the beginning why can't serve it on time!!!< /Review>

<Review>Let's put aside the fact that this place is inside a ginormous mall... because that in and of itself is annoying.  However, considering the wait is usually around an hour, its quite clever of them to put their restaurant in a place where you can do things while you wait.

In any case, what's not to love? The food is delicious, fast, and reasonably priced. I can't complain.  I make any excuse to go there if I'm passing by.  Seriously.<//Review>< pics>

The flavor of soup dumplings were good but there were no soup.  The soup dumpling is too dry.  Disappointed.</text>

Delicious place. I love that they text you when your table is ready so that means you can walk around the mall while you wait. Downside is the wait and the price. Look to spend at least $25 a person if you want to be full. 4.5 stars.<//Text>

Not the best version of Din Tai Fung (the original location in Artesia is probably the best), but for those craving soup dumplings, highly recommended. The wait can be a bit long, so plan to be waiting for up an hour or more.< /text>

Beat the line! Eat at the bar. Always open seating at the bar. There is a small waiting area next to the entrance. This is great for small groups. 2-3 (21+ older) although two is best. Full menu and drinks.</Review>

Finally after a month of being open, we had tried to come 4 times and every time was like 2-1/2 hour wait...  but this time we managed to come at the right time. A good time to come is during the week as soon as they open or before dinner rush. We only had to wait 5 minutes. We had spicy wontons with pork and shrimp by far my favorite dish. I could drink The flavorful sauce they serve it in mmm. Also we had bok choy and cabbage, chicken dumplings, kimchi and pork dumplings. We also had Shang high rice cakes with chicken that was my least favorite item we had ordered. This dish lacked in flavor. Love this place and can't wait to come back. Make sure every one in your party is there before you try to sit down. Store policy that every member of your party is present if you want to be seated.< /text>

Everything was okay, except the menu in Chinese says 蟹黃小笼包， but on the ordering menu, it says snow crab, instead of 蟹黃.  So we ordered it anyway, and the snow crab version came out.

We have visited at least 6 different Din Tai Feng restaurants in different parts of the world, (three of them in Taipei).  But this is the very first time we experienced this.   Disappointing for such a nice restaurant.</Review>

He introduced himself and was very polite. At first we didn't know how to fill out the order card, but Vince made it clear. He gave us great service and asked how we were and how the food was a couple times. It was also very easy to wave him down when we were ready to order. The food was amazing, we ordered things that were all different and unique from one another and they were all equally tasty! Not one thing stood out, it all did!! Overall amazing experience, I would definitely  recommend and go back. I really liked how they provided comment cards as well.

And most of my friends are not all Asian.  We’re mix group.  So they all wanted to go to try food at ding tai fung.  And I don’t like their dumplings.    Or any of their dishes. If you like real Asian food, go to Asian area like Alhambra, San Gabriel , roiling Heights or Monterey Park.  They serve real authentic Asian food.

We came here on a super busy day (the weekend before Christmas), so the mall was very crowded, but we were seated within 10 minutes. We spent that time looking through the window in the front of the restaurant where you can watch the staff prepare fresh dumplings! It's definitely a little mesmerizing since they have a little dumpling assembly line going on, so it's nice to pass the time.

After we got seated, our server Jedi (FYI, it's not pronounced the Star Wars way) walked us through the menu and ordering process since we haven't been there before. It's basically a list of all the menu items on a sheet of paper where you indicate how many of each item you want, similar to a sushi restaurant. For anyone new to the dumpling scene, they have a menu with descriptions and photos of each item, so it makes it really easy to order.

Most of the plates come in portions that are shareable, so I would recommend trying a little bit of everything if you're there with a group. Family style worked really well for us since we all wanted to order almost everything on the menu.

I would highly recommend the Pork XiaoLongBao (steamed dumplings with a little soup in each), Sauteed String Beans with Garlic, Vegetable & Pork Wontons with Spicy Sauce, and Noodles with Sesame Sauce. YUM!

We also ordered drinks and I had what I think was called the Golden Emporer, it was an Old Fashioned type drink and was just as delicious.

Jedi was great to us and we all really enjoyed our dinner. The only reason I docked a star was because the bar was super backed up and we didn't receive our drinks until we were pretty much finished with dinner. But next time I'm in town, I'll definitely be back.< /review>

This is my favorite Chinese food place. The dumpling are made daily and you can even see them making it. There is usually a very long line, you can wait up to one hour and a half. The vegetables and fresh and my favorites are the green beans.</text>

To be seated after they texted took a long time. We had a smaller party and watched many people who came after us be seated first. When we finally were seated we got really uncomfortable seats. The waitress although nice took a while to come by. Definitely felt like we were being ignored/forgotten. The food was good, pricy but still good. We hope it was more negligence than racism in ignoring the black girls.<//Review>

The shao lung bao is very good. The other dumpling is OK. We ordered a preserved cabbage lomein is very good. The chow nien goh is excellent. Price is on the steep side. But we will eat there again. The service is also very good.< /text>

Great food. Happy that there are now so many locations in L.A/O.C. I remember their original location in Arcadia. Even though the wait time is usually about an hour, since it's inside Del Amo mall, it's easy to pass the time.< /text>

New locations are good besides the first 2 locations. The best one should be that one in Taipei.</text>

When you want some Xiao Long Bao you no longer have to drive all the way to Arcadia or Orange County!  Service is always excellent!</review>

<Text>Food is pretty tasty, staff is friendly, good service, though portion wise is questionable. The Shrimp Noodle soup, as told by our server, is family style (2-3 ppl) yet it was barely enough for 1. Otherwise, good place< /Text>< Name>

Din Tai Fung makes me cry of happiness. I've been here twice and both times I think I went to heaven. Every bite is like a chorus of angels caressing your tongue. This is ambrosia. This is God's food. My girlfriend has dreams about the spicy chicken wontons. The soup xiao long bao is perfection. The memory of the taste of the chocolate xiao long bao haunts my tongue whenever i eat inferior sweets (read: all sweets). If you love yourself, go to din tai fung. This location has almost NO wait usually, which is unheard of. at the Glendale location, you can wait up to four hours, but the most I've waited here is about 20 minutes. The staff is always INCREDIBLE, friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. No one there looks like they hate their job (it's probably because they're having lunch there, too). Anyway, self care is going to din tai fung. it has a Michelin star for a reason, and this is the best location in terms of wait time by far.<//text>

Great xiao long bao, sauteed kale, beef braised noodle soup, shu mai, pork chop and fried rice.  Din Tai Fung is more expensive than your typical dim sum restaurant but you are paying for the quality of the food ,exceptional service ( which is non existent in most Chinese resturants) and ambiance. If you despise an extensive wait time like I do,  go during off peak hours early lunch or early dinner.</Text>

<response>None</response><Text>It was 3:45pm on march 25, 2016 and we placed our 3 person table request at reception. After waited for 15 minutes and seeing they were seating 3 people tables arrived after us, we found out they did not even enter our names for table request on their system!

Ok, human error, but no apologies? After they found out their mistake, they were still seating 4 more small tables before us and it took them 5 more minutes before they seated us. When we got into the dinning area, their house was not busy and there were 4 other 3-ppl tables open. So they simply took their time to set our table even they knew they made the mistake and with no apologies.

After we got seated we gave our server Jane our order sheet right away. Great. 15 minutes later, we thought we will get our food to stuff my starving toddler. And we saw people who came in later already eating. Apparently she didn't enter our order into the system until 17 minutes after we handed her our order sheet.

Almost everything went wrong with our order. We asked for less salt in our veggie, and they ended up with no salt instead. We asked for half sugar in the Boba milk tea, and ended up with full sugar. We added a couple of dishes and it took them another 15 minutes for them to show up, of course our dear Jane forgot to enter the order again.

Food was good but very disappointed with their reception service today. We have been to this same location multiple times and was pretty good, until today, very disappointed. If it was rush hour, we would understand, but it was 4pm in the afternoon. Come on!< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>Delivers every time. Excellent variety. Our family favorites are the house chichen bonenin soup, sweet and sour soup as well as the pork soup dumplings. If I could be critical would be on the timing from requesting the check to leave the restaurant. Besides that these guys are a spot on operation. I first ate this type of food in New York China Town. Then googled it and was surprised they had it in LA in the San Gabriel vally. I waited on the o9ng lines there prior to 2006 when they expanded and now are huge all over LA. Tried them and same quality and organization is in their Taipei restaurants. It's an iconic and must try place and for some of us now a casual spot to grab food with the entire family.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRZKvvACd3diQbGu5MLSQ0BxfbBrkH1ztyLUgv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><gmap_id>0x80dd4b2bbcf466fb:0x5b772d325bf8610e</gmap_id><Name>Nikolay Ivanov< /Name>< Resp>

Another location for a famous chain. Din Tai Fung has a lot of locations in Southern California but at last we have a convenient location for the South Bay.

Their Xao Lin Bao (Shanghai Dumplings) are what they are famous for but everything is good. My server was very attentive and friendly. I ordered Xao Lin Bao and the Shrimp with rice cakes. Too much for one person but I was by myself and finished it anyway. I just sat there and sipped Jasmine tea to finish things off.

Hint: they are usually very crowded but I went around 4 on a Saturday and only had to wait for ten minutes to get seated.< /Review>

I first went here in February and most recently yesterday. There was virtually no wait time for a party of 6. We just walked in and since all 6 were present, we were seated immediately. Booths were comfortable and service was friendly, attentive, and fast. Of course the food was superb as well. We ordered xiao long bao, pork and shrimp shiu mai, green beans, cucumber salad, shrimp fried rice, and hot and sour soup. Everything tasted on point. Love this location!<//Text>

<text>Food was OK, nothing to rave about. Service seemed very rushed. Prices are super high for what you get. I can get the same food that tastes much better in the SGV at a hole in the wall.

Came here for lunch with a friend recently, it's located inside the mall which is kind of irritating. I have to walk through a bunch of shops to get to the restaurant. The interior Decour is very nice, but that is also reflected in the high prices. We ordered the XLB obviously, and the garlic green beans to start. The garlic green beans actually tasted pretty good. However their signature XLB was super tiny, and very bland, didn't taste good at all. In addition they were lukewarm which means they have been sitting out for a while before being brought to the table.

Truthfully, I can get bigger, better tasting, better quality XLB at many different locations in the SGV for literally half of the price. I feel like this place is way too hyped up and not worth the price or the hassle.

Service was extremely rushed, it seems like they were really trying to get us out of there as soon as possible. Parking was a total nightmare near the mall. Even on a weekday at lunchtime.

I really don't like this place. Will not be returning!</text>< Resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Pork XiaoLongBao soup dumplings:  Don't worry about the pronunciation, they give you a sheet to order from by quantifying the items you'd like and handing it to your server.  Pork filled dumplings with  warm broth.  Be careful!  Give time for dumplings to cool, eat in one bite because the broth will squirt out everywhere.  Perfect ratio of pork and dough with a delicious broth.   I can understand some reviewers critiquing the dumplings as "plain" but just dip in soy sauce and problem solved.

Shrimp and Pork Wontons:  This is the only reason for deduction.  The wonton dough was perfection, but the shrimp and Pork combination were not harmonious to the palate.   The design of the wonton, with the shrimp on top and pork at the bottom of dough,  just didn't mesh at all.  I would skip ordering this dish next time, but you never know until you try.

Vegetable and Pork Dumplings with Spicy Sauce:  Not even by my "white girl" terms is this spicy.  But the spicy/sweet sauce is divine.   I even smothered my other dumplings into that goodness, you may get looks, but do it!

Pear and Lychee Martini:  I am always blown away at restaurants that can craft exquisite cocktails to enjoy with their food.  The bartenders are very knowledgeful and really take the time to craft your drinks (rubbing orange peel on rim of glass and using fresh ingredients). Yes, the place does get packed but stand in line for the bar area if 21 and over to expedite your wait time.

The restaurant is huge but definitely gets filled quickly especially during peak hours of happy hour and weekends.  Received top service from everyone from the hostess, bartender,  and our server.  Clean, oh my goodness, so clean!

Price wise, I thought all of the items were reasonably priced.  I don't understand people that expect 5 star food on a 1 star budget.  I will be back without a doubt!</Review>< pics>

I will strongly suggest your management invest on the quality of the food instead of fancy togo boxs and bags..What a bad experience!   Its absolutelly not worth the money and time of the wait...GOOD LUCK!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b2bbcf466fb:0x5b772d325bf8610e<//Gmap_id></record>

<Response>None</Response><Review>I dined here this past Tuesday night with a party of 5, got a # a little before 6pm and was seated at 8pm. No problem, I knew there'd be a wait, I even ate a snack before heading to the mall. I love that DTF efficiently uses technology of texting you when it's time. However, I felt slightly cheated that upon checking in, I had to wait another 15 minutes before actually getting seated. What a tease!

I had their XLB pork, XLB crab/pork, seafood stir fry noodles, fried rice, spicy wontons, green beans, and veggie bun.

I was disappointed with the lack of soup inside the XLB and the pork was bland. The XLB crab/pork was actually more on the dry side.

Seafood stir fry noodles were bland and on the greasy side that lacked seafood. The fried rice was pretty tasty and not too oily as were their signature green beans. I think the spicy wontons were my favorite part of this meal. The sauce they use was so good, that I drizzled the sauce onto the stir fry noodles.

The pork bun and veggie bun were marked incorrectly. Green dot on top stood for veggie while the red for pork. After biting into this mistake, my friend and I traded since I ordered veggie and he ordered pork. The veggie bun itself was pretty good and filled with an abundance of minced green veggies. However, I've had stomach issues since after this meal and the only thing that I ate that no one else in my group ate was the veggie bun. That may be the culprit for my frequent restroom use.

Service was so-so, the server forgot a few items on the original print-out, but later remembered and added them. The pork and veggie buns were added later. He didn't check up on us as much as we'd liked and it was difficult to wave him down.

Since this DTF location just opened about 2 weeks ago, I think they need to have a pep talk with the cooks. I'm not impressed with this location compared to their Costa Mesa, Arcadia, and Glendale locations.</Review>< username>

(Translated by Google) Enjoy your meal in a super Chinese restaurant !! Good and everything is very fresh. You can admire the dumplings made on the spot! The impeccable service. Large and welcoming restaurant. They advise you to take 2 dishes each because in fact the portions are small. Value for money: slightly expensive for a Chinese ... but everything is handmade and fresh. So justified. I haven't tried the desserts.

(Original)
Buon appetito in un super ristorante cinese!! Buono e tutto è freschissimo. Potrete ammirare i dumpling fatti sul momento! Il servizio impeccabile. Ristorante grande ed accogliente. Ti consigliano di prendere 2 piatti a testa perché in effetti le porzioni sono piccole. Rapporto qualità/prezzo: leggermente caro per un cinese...ma è tutto fatto a mano e fresco. Quindi giustificato. Non ho provato i dolci.< /review>

Braised noodle soup 는   살짝 얼큰한 맛이 좋았어요. 체인점이라  여기저기 몇 군데 있더라구요<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlM90C05ewOsXa_OQwSPOKgyhIFoZ2DYRz8lI0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRRxIvHM_P1VtsGxW830TvnawmGXRB7vC0Rl_v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dd4b2bbcf466fb:0x5b772d325bf8610e<//GmapID></record>

<review>(Translated by Google) I think that you will eat even if you ask a lot because it is not the size and amount of America size.
The small buns made in the restaurant are delicious.
Wonton was also delicious.
We went early at around 5pm but were already in line.
It ’s better to be prepared to line up.

(Original)
アメリカサイズではない大きさや量なのでたくさん頼んでも食べると思います。
そのお店内で作ってる小籠包とかは美味しい。
ワンタンも美味しかった。
早めの夕ご飯5時ごろに行ったけどすでに並んでました。
並ぶのを覚悟して行った方がいいです。< /review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Well worth the michellin star. This Taiwanese restaurant has been awarded a michellin star. In the middle of the largest shopping center in the United States, this restaurant has all kinds of dim sum, buns and other Taiwanese dishes. These dishes are very tasty and well worth going to. Some people may find it too expensive, but a dish costs between 5 and 25 dollars but on average about 10 dollars. The interior is very chic and certainly adds to the atmosphere. It is always busy in this restaurant and sometimes there is a queue. You can then draw a number and you will receive an email when there is a table. By the way, there is always a queue in L.A. The staff are nice and know almost everything about the menu. Our waitress knew it all and could recommend good dishes. The portions are not very large, but certainly filling and it is nice to combine different things. In short, this chain is a hit and anyone who likes good quality food will love this. Super!

De michellin ster zeker waard. Dit Taiwanese restaurant is bekroont met een michellin ster. Midden in het grootste winkelcentrum van de Verenigde Staten staat dit restaurant wat allemaal soorten dim sum, buns en andere Taiwanese gerechten. Deze gerechten zijn erg lekker en zeker de moeite waard om naar toe te gaan. Sommige mensen zullen het misschien te duur vinden maar een gerecht kost tussen de 5 en 25 dollar maar gemiddeld zo'n 10 dollar. Het interieur is zeer shique en zeker een goede toevoeging aan de sfeer. Het is altijd druk in dit restaurant en soms is er een wachtrij. Je kan dan een nummertje trekken en je krijgt een e-mail als er een tafel is. Overigens is er in L.A. altijd een wachtrij. Het personeel is aardig en weet bijna alles van de kaart. Onze serveerster wist het allemaal en kon goede gerechten aanraden. De porties zijn niet heel groot maar zeker vullend en het is lekker om verschillende dingen te combineren. Kortom deze keten is een hit en iedereen die van kwalitatief goed eten houd zal dit geweldig vinden. Super!< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have to wait a long time on the weekend.......(I have been waiting for an hour, continue)
Unlike Taiwan, which uses a public number plate, you can clearly know that you have to wait for several groups.... This is more open.
Mr. went to see if there were some vacancies in the room, but he still had to wait for the counter.... I don’t understand why this is the process.

(Original)
週末要等很久.......（已等了一小時了，持續中）
不像台灣是用公開的號碼牌，可以明確知道還要再等幾組.....這樣比較公開化。
先生去看裡面有一些空位，詢問櫃檯卻還要等.....不理解為何是這樣的流程<//Review>< user>

(Translated by Google) It's very complicated on weekends and evenings. You have to wait or make a reservation. It is a restaurant famous for chains, but take out is light. The taste of dim sum disappears and only the dumpling taste is cooled. The packaging never shines

(Original)
주말이나 저녁시간에는 많이 복잡합니다. 예약을 하시던지 기다리셔야합니다. 체인으로 유명한 식당인데 take out은 비추입니다. 딤섬 고유맛이 다 사라지고 식은 만두맛만 납니다. 포장은 절대비추</Review>
