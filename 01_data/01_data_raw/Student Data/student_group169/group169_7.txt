<Text>So I went for just a simple medium fade and that was all. I am in the military and I have gone to many barber shops and haircut establishments, and have had bad haircuts before but nothing really tops the one that they just gave me. There was a younger girl who was cutting my hair and she just seemed very inexperienced and the haircut took only ten minutes. Within that ten minutes she had to have the other lady come and assist twice. When it was all said and done I saw what my hair looked like and I asked her to blend in my fade which took another five minutes and the end result was a worst one then the first. So after losing my patience but remaining polite I said It was done and went to pay. I was expecting there to be a 10-13 dollar price for my “fade” (which it wasn’t even worth five dollars) but it was $19 without a tip. When I went to sign the receipt and crossed out the tip portion the lady seemed to get upset with me and just walked away. Military be wary of this place bc they don’t know how to do a proper military cut. Don’t make my mistake. Here is the view of the back and you don’t want to see the front...< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWccuENX_247JJHArBErv6gBu1H6NEzIXow8t7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAVdW6ZletSbT98RIfoifTR9tC4LITreY71WRK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<Review>While the girl who did my hair was nice and the trim I go is decent, I felt like everything was rushed. I’ve never had a place not finish blow drying my hair. I was so shocked that I ended up telling her I was fine with her not finishing. I won’t be coming back.<//Review><Response>None<//Response><Time>1606167231667<//Time><UserId.>106284729930667384276</UserId.><Rate>2<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>This place is great. Anna and Teresa are the best. My son wont sit still for anyone else but Teresa. We have tried other people and he always complains that they hurt him. Anna is the only person I trust with my hair. She is very detailed and amazingly patient. I'm very picky with hair cuts sometimes I'm seriously asking her to get a single hair or two and she always seems happy to help. You can really tell they take pride in their work. I feel like we get a fancy salon quality haircut but at supercuts price.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>I had a great experience and the gentleman next to me was a mess and Melissa did a perfect fade and he looked excellent.  All the ladies were a hoot and the music was perfect. My stylist Megan did exactly what other salons were unable to achieve. I love my hair! I will be back.<//Review>< Resp>

The  haircut was rushed. I wasn't asked if I was satisfied with it or wanted it shorter. When I was paying and she said 6 dollars I was surprised.  But, when I got home. , I over paid caused I tipped her a ten. I still need someone to fix my hair. The staff sounds so full of themselves,  I mean , conversation wise. Nope, avoid.....< /Review>

I guess I went during the busiest time of the day. Even though I put my name on the list and others after me on the list kept getting picked before me not sure why. The cut was good and the lady was nice. I’m sure I’ll be back.<//text>

Horrible service to the customer. Waited over an hour for no reason. They had plenty of chairs but only 2 people working. Won't be returning. Twice the price as a regular shop, half the people and bad service...Not worth the trouble.< /Text>

Great food; Vietnamese sandwiches, snacks, desserts, and all sorts of delicious baked goods. Cheap prices. But the place is always packed with people waiting to get in.< /text>

The food isn’t bad, and will satisfy your craving for banh mi and a variety of snacks at cheap prices . But the poor service, poor covid safety, and long wait is enough to stop me from coming back (at least to this location). Would recommend the cleaner THH restaurant chain instead.

Food:
Grilled pork Banh mi was tasty with generous portion of meat. The egg rolls were nicely fried, and peppery. Also got some chicken pate chaud at really cheap prices. Good but a bit salty, and could use more meat. They sell their baguettes too which is nice to bring home to snack on.

Downsides:
- Covid measures are not being enforced well here. The sign says no more than 10 customers inside and there were definitely at least 30 customers crammed inside when I got there.
-Workers are eating inside maskless on lunch breaks. Also the workers are inside yelling a lot so that can’t be great even with masks.
- service is below average. While I was trying to order the cashier was having an entire side conversation with another customer and interrupted me 4x to the point I was laughing in disbelief. Then got impatient with us  as we ordered with the language barrier.
- wait times are really long when there’s a line. We waited in line for 10min, then another 20min for food. Not the “quick” snack we thought it would be.<//Review>

<text>For the price, I definitely can't complain. My favorite is the shredded chicken banh mí. I don't speak Vietnamese but thankfully they understand English. I need to learn how to say "extra patè" for next time 😂< /text>< gmapID>

I went there on Saturday just to buy a baguette and the line was long but I decided to wait.... it wasn't worth it! the baguette was cold and hard I asked the lady to give me a warm one (fresh one) which she refused and said "no no no" waiving her hand she didn't care because I had already paid for it...
Rude staff and a very dirty place never going back!!</Text>

<Date>1556976667953<//Date><rate>4<//rate><text>This is a perfect one stop for all of your meals and snacks when you’re on a budget.  Buy 2 bánh mì, get 1 free and the same for those yummy sweet coconut chè desserts.  There’s always a line to order and pay for food but it moves pretty fast.

There’s a small area on the side for sitting down but it could really use a little sprucing up to make it more inviting to sit down and enjoy your drinks.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQo2JtKgQiyCI61cQ9Zy1fisI_Iy-sS3kFt7ds=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMujRm6kgfIbSMAUKUkxYOBJ46q6vUN7yt4fsTm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4zeE89jamLf8oUIWPZiDS051nkwB_zVCCdx01=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXOH-lkwC7jsWR5MqdmyVmezP4aubUabVpKu1j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoSzvSzIp_5lagtOm1ea_ELaOoZPVG2jG4VYBr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCwU3MriBI3xadjK_X9J9XbliPwI41xgDiFnYI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORBNHU18G1xQRDeVB6NhlkZLC-Xzx8FGQojd37=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5klYUvc-viP-8rcdLib7TY44bagO3q5Vmg3nx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDZKHiaVinyTKksEMhMqO6xcdDg-iXPidsfa7U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtJ5qowSXQ1KW-ZMbxsg8_X50TqtQhfGKeD3w4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

My favorite place for Vietnamese sandwiches. They also have great pate and I get that to add to the sandwiches at home. Anytime I go, I pick up three for my neighbor as well. I have had these sandwiches other places, but they are never as good as here.</Review>

5-STAR RECOMMENDATION: The Banh Mi Che Cali Bakery is located on Brookhurst Street in Garden Grove, California. The Banh Mi sandwiches are delicious! The French bread is delicious! There is plenty of parking. Be advised of the peak hours as parking may be difficult to find.<//review>

<Review>Absolutely a horrible place to anyone who doesn't understand Vietnamese bakeries/shops. Wait for fresh baguette bread; its buttery heaven. I personally love the pork roll pate.

<Review>I like this place but it was very confusing. I stood in line ordered my sandwiches and I told the cashier I wanted egg rolls and she told me I had to get it myself and stand in line again . So I assumed she canceled my sandwich order cause she just ignored me. So I ordered the sandwiches again and got lectured about how I reordered. How would I know what they placed to order or not when they never said anything. They pretty much have blamed me, and I just paid for it since I wanted to get out. The place has good food but need better customer service and communication.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
This place was okay. They have a big selection of food, especially to-go and sandwiches. They have good deals like buy 2 sandwiches get 1 free and buy one dessert (specific ones) get one free.

The place is cash only though. It is very fast paced you need to know what you're doing when you come here. Certain items you get yourself, other items you order. Tip: know your order before you go up because they get frustrated easily if you try to figure it out as you go up there.</Review>

This place was packed on Saturday afternoon. Not sure why they were so busy. They offer banh mi(vietnamese sandwich) , che (desserts) , waffles, egg rolls, ready to eat banh cuon, xoi ( sticky rice), banh bao (steamed buns), banh bò (steamed rice cake), and more. Their prices are not any better than other places. Their food are not the best either. A convenient place to pickup different kinds of Vietnamese food at once.< /review>

Called and asked, "Do you have bahn mi?" Lady says, "What kind?" I say, "Like, a tofu bahn mi sandwich." She replies with, "What kind?" three more times as I try to rephrase my original sentence, as if it was too confusing for her... anyway, after the 5th time she said, "What kind?" I said, "Well, what kind do you have?" (assuming this might be an easier route for the conversation). She then said (arrogantly) "Okay you come here, you check menu." And then she hung up. Lady I'm NEVER coming to your restaurant 😂😂😂</Review>

<Text>I am totally addicted to this place. They have fresh baked items everyday. The earlier you go the better and fresher. It seems no matter what time I go, there is a line, but it is well worth the wait. The offer baguettes, pho, chicken wings, bahn mi sandwiches (I highly recommend with the veggies INSIDE for the full experience of this glorious sandwich. They also have some desserts I haven't tried yet and I'm still exploring all they have to offer.

When you go, you have to get the BOBA milk, green, or thai tea. The also offer more than just boba to add to your drinks.  Just get in there and try it.  Oh and did I mention the teas are BOGO FREE? $3.00 for the regular size, $3.50 for the large. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $.50 for the large because with the size of the straws to suck up the BOBAs, the tea will be gone quickly.

Happy eating!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I like the Sandwiches here, but the customer service people are not very friendly, I would like to see that improved.  Onto another issue, the homeless have the tendency to be overly aggressive at this shop, I have observed a homeless person stood at the doorway inside the shop, asking for hand out, this is not acceptable.  The problem lies solely on the management team at this shop, they need to protect the customer from issues such as this.<//text>

<Text>As a Vietnamese American this is the place I always need to go with visiting SoCal.  This hits all the comfort food if you are truly VIET for life.  They have great banh mi, coffee with Boba, che and that raisin bread.

I wish more non Vietnamese people knew about this place cause it truly tastes like Vietnam.  Get anything here and you won't be disappointed.</Text>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>My favorite banh mi place! I usually order the grilled pork and they give you a huge bag of the ingredients so you can put whatever you like in your banh mi. I've heard the special combo is really good too.

From my experience, The bread is perfect, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, and it has buy 2 get 1 free meaning you can get 3 banh mi for $5! It's the best value and the store is always extremely busy, so I feel pretty good for supporting the little Asian ladies that work their butts off. My family always orders banh mi in bulk here for events and a lot of the times we get baguettes too. They also have cheap boba and other goods, which I have yet to try. Definitely the place to go for banh mi!<//Text>< Pictures>

# 3- meat sandwich "dry hard overnight bread"
# 4 - the person who charges "ant woman" needs to check attitude 🤔
# 5- need to have the Department of Food Protection come check

#1- giò cháo quẩy chai và cứng
#2- chè và nước dừa rất mau thiu
#3- bánh mì thịt "bánh mì qua đêm cứng khô"
#4- người tính tiền"cô mang kiến" cần coi lại thái độ 🤔
#5- cần có sở bảo vệ thực phẩm đến kiểm tra
#6- nên đi qua tiệm khác ủng hộ thay vì ở đây
#7- vì cách cư xử với khách hàng đó là quyền của họ chọn
**Tôi đã đã ủng hộ tiệm mấy chục năm qua, vài năm trở lại đây có nhiều thái độ không thể chấp nhận được để tiếp tục ủng hộ nữa!**<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>(Translated by Google) I would like to share with you today. I like Tea and the porridge of Cali tea and bread shop. But today I bought 2 Tô, please come back to the cafeteria and 3 corn tea. I bought it at 6:30 in the afternoon. I brought porridge to the cafeteria. 2 my wife and I ate. After eating about half an hour later, my wife and I ran away in time to meet the toilet house. 2 My wife and I thought that Going to Cau Bridge Once was ok. After half an hour and a half, I can't run halfway into the Stubborn half. And half an hour and a half makes us go 1 more time !!! We are afraid to take the medicine to prevent diarrhea. After We Drink Medications That Prevent Diarrhea Also, Let My Background Share With You. If You Season The Food That The Weather Is Hot. Mostly Summer Don't Never Buy NON-STANDARD CHAIRS AIR-CONDITIONER STAY IN THE COOLING PARTY AT THE FALLED CHARTER AND THE BUYER ON EATING AFTER BEING !!!!!!!!!!!! I WOULD COMPLETE THE MANAGER OF CALCULATING CAKE WHICH SHOULD BE FOR THIS MISSION. AND RETURN TO THE STAFF OF THE STAFF.

I am happy I decided to come to breakthrough tattoo. I got my first tattoo and Ernie did an awesome job. Even though it was a small and simple tattoo, Ernie took his time in making sure he understood what i wanted. I love the way it came out and that makes me want to get more😁 Great experience and will be back in the future!<//review>< Date>

Artist are talented and professional-Very clean shop-Treat me like family and work with me on design. I've never had a infection or blown out tattoo. They know what they are doing. Chris designed my 4 designs to satisfy what I wanted.

I've been getting tattooed by Chris since I was 18. 19 years ago.</Text>

Been to four different tattoo shops and after going to breakthrough tattoo, this one stood out from them all. Best experience I’ve had at a tattoo shop, I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get ink done!</review>

<text>Gabe is amazing! He has been my tattoo artist for 7 years now and I will have many more years to come with him! I just beat cancer not long ago and I have an awesome wonder woman he did on my right forearm so he came up with this amazing piece to symbolize a strong woman beating cancer and I love it and this is very "me" he takes ur personality and incorporates it into his work! His pricing is great and honestly I would now only go to him I've seen other people's work and what can happen and what has happened and u are in AMAZING hands with him!<//text></record>

Very clean shop. And the artist are polite and do awesome work. Stopped by to talk with them and gave Elijah an idea what we wanted. Made an appt date and when he showed us what he came up with was beyond our expectation, and it's looks awesome. Half on my arm and the other have on the wifes. Will definitely be cimi g back and having Elijah do more work.</review>

<review>Repeat customer for a few years now, I keep going back because I trust my artist Gabe. He’s direct and confident about his artwork. You can take breaks if you need to or not.  Either way he’s right there with you keeping everything clean and making sure your tattoo is wrapped/covered and secured before you head out the door. Thank you Gabe!<//review>< Pics>

<text>My experience with tattoos have not been good AT ALL....Until I walked through the doors at Breakthrough Tattoo. I wanted to get a tattoo before I left to go back to Colorado, It was very short notice. Bryan (The artist there) said that he would do the tattoo. He basically worked a double shift to fit me in his schedule even though he was booked into the middle of August. He stayed until 11 pm to complete the tattoo. The tattoo is AMAZING!!!!! I would like to say that you should ignore any negative reviews about Breakthrough because I can recommend them without any hesitation at all. They are a legit shop with an awesome vibe and chill artists who are willing to go out of their way to make sure you are happy with your art. They pride themselves in their artwork and it is more than just a business to them. It is their passion they have for the Tattoo culture that "Breakthroughs" any negative ideologies or beliefs one may have about the Tattoo industry. If you don't know where to get work done it's SIMPLE.....GO TO BREAKTHROUGH and you will walk out with AMAZING art that you won't hesitate to show off to everyone!!!! Thanks Bryan for FINALLY giving me an AWESOME tattoo experience and a piece that my entire family and I absolutely LOVE!!! I will come here all the way from Colorado to get my work done ONLY by Breakthrough tattoo...that's over a 1000 miles to go to get a tattoo....if that doesn't say something about how AWESOME Breakthrough Tattoo is then I don't know what will!!!! Keep killin' it Breakthrough Tattoo...you will be seeing me again!!!!

REVIEW PART 2!!!!

So I was so stoked about my tattoo I just got from Bryan M. that I really wanted to get another tattoo but this one for my daughter (since the dirt bike one is for my son). However I knew that he was booked and there was no way he would be able to do another tattoo for me (since he had to work a double just to do my tattoo for my son. My wife FINALLY talked me into asking him if he could do another tattoo..This was at midnight!! So I texted him and asked him if he could do another tattoo...he texted me back immediately and said he would do whatever he could to fit me in. He texted me at 7 the next morning and asked me if I could be there at noon. I said definitely. I showed up and he did another INSANELY AWESOME TATTOO. I told him I really appreciated him fitting me in  and he said “when you texted me I had to find a way to fit you in before you went back to Colorado.....he did just that. Reviews about Breakthrough Tattoo that day they don’t answer the phone or do bad work simply is NOT TRUE. I have witnessed personally on two different occasions them going out of their way to get the ink done that I wanted with little or no notice!! Breakthrough Tattoo is a shop that can be trusted. I can’t express enough my gratitude and satisfaction that I have for Breakthrough Tattoo. If you go somewhere else that could be a mistake. They are booked for a reason. Don’t go anywhere else but to Breakthrough Tattoo!!!!! Thanks again Bryan M. for everything you have done for me. You have COMPLETELY changed the way I feel about tattoos! I actually have ink I LOVE looking at instead of trying to find a way to hide them! My son and daughter could not be more pleased about the art you did.....YOU DID....your art brought a smile to their face that is simply priceless!!!! Thanks Bro I will be forever grateful!! I will be seeing you again!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

My mom and I got mother daughter tattoos, it was my first and her second, both of hers have been from Gabe and my one was by Gabe. He did an amazing job at both of our tattoos and gave us exactly what we asked for! He helped calm me down when I was nervous about the pain and it ended up being not bad at all! He was very kind and was great at making conversation through the whole process! We love our tattoos and will continue to go to him for more in the future!</Text>

All artists have their proper licensing, they check I.D. and you must sign liability forms before you get work done. I really appreciate this kind of atmosphere, I like knowing that my health, well being, and perfect tattoo are of utmost importance. Gabe was my tattoo artist an he does amazing work and my 4 hour session went by quick. Hes really funny and he makes you feel comfortable, most importantly his work is sick. I had a great experience I can't wait to go back<//text></record>

<Review>This was my first tattoo. I meet with Gabe and told him what I wanted. He put together a truly beautiful design. The day of the tattoo I was nervous. I picked a hard place(ankle)for my first tattoo but, he was very patient and encouraging. I'm happy with my tattoo it is exactly what I wanted.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I just got my first tattoo done at Breakthrough and I don't see myself going anywhere else. Gabe is an amazing artist and an extremely down to earth individual. You honestly get more than what you pay for with the quality of work these guys put into their art here. Any time I am in the southern California area from now on I will be sure to come back here for another one.<//review>

Breakthrough is the spot. And Gabe Cervantes is the man. I found breakthrough by doing a Google maps search, and I chose them because they had a five star rating. I had an idea for a tat bouncing around my head for some years now and was finally ready to go talk to an artist to make it happen. My first consultation with Gabe was bad ass. Within a half hour the idea I had problems picturing was already done in his mind.

That's a bad ass dude! I've had 2 sessions now for a total of about 7 hours needle time and I am stoked. Gabes shading is unreal, and his attention to detail is far from impressive. I know a lot of people swear they have the best tattoo guy ever. They haven't met Gabe or been to breakthrough yet.. If you have an idea and want a legit artist. You'd be well served to go see Gabe.< /Review>

Found them on google and decided to give them a try. Actually just got mine today. Chris did my tattoo and he was pretty booked til June but his wife politely squeezed me in before then! they are very nice, professional, and chill !!! and he did my tattoo FAST, faster than I expected !! of course its going to hurt, but it only took 2 hours or less so it wasn't too bad at all. He said he usually doesn't do the kind of tattoo he did on me, but he did a PERFECT JOB. could not be happier !!! if there is any piece, send em a pic and they should be able to do it and do a really good job on it! THANKS AGAIN !! VERY HAPPY !!!<//text>

I am visiting my sister from Houston, TX and we have always wanted to get tattoos together so I looked at places in the area and decided to check out breakthrough! We met with Fernando and I had already read great reviews about him but he completely exceeded the high expectations I already had set for him! He was so patient with us as we discussed our ideas. His attention to detail was on point and he went above and beyond to enure we had the best experience! When I get another tattoo it won't be until I'm visiting from Texas again! Great artist and great shop!<//text>

<review>Walked it for my tattoo. The guy was very helpful, taking the time making sure the tattoo was just the way I liked it (even when I kept asking to make it smaller it was not a problem). Franando did a great job designing the perfect tattoo. Even the other guys around were nice. Highly recommend them. Will be going back for my next tattoo</review>< Pictures>

Travel over 5000 miles.
Go to metal festival.
Google tattoo shops.
Walk in off the street and get an awesome piece done by Jake, who totally got what I was after and put a sticker on my arm, I'd happily go again if I'm ever back in that part of the world, couldn't recommend this place enough< /Text>

Make an appointment, otherwise they will over charge walk-ins late at night. "Over time prices."
Good work from the shop, just don't get ripped off.< /review>

< Review>
Breakthrough tattoo is the best shop around!!! Chris (the owner) is a great guy with an amazing group of artists on his team. Whoever you choose as your artist, you won’t be disappointed! They do excellent quality work and all the guys are really nice, professional and exceed the expectations of all the clients! The shop is clean, amd the atmosphere is amazing! I wouldn’t let anyone else tattoo me except one of the breakthrough team! Chris has done all my work over the last 15 years and I’ve followed him thru his career (and the different shops he’s worked at thru the years) and I’m so proud of him being such a successful shop OWNER! If you choose Breakthrough for your next tattoo, I’m confident you won’t ever wanna go anywhere else! Call today and make your appt!</Review>

<review>Researched most of the tattoo shops in the local area, most were out of control expensive as you pay for the name.  I walked in to Breakthrough tattoo on Foothill and Grove in Upland and asked for help. The owner Chris MacCharles was happy to answer my questions and take the time to have a real conversation unlike the other shops I had looked into.  I'm 54 and recently lost my husband and wanted a tattoo in memory of him but if you see it you would never know it's a memorial.  I had 5 sessions for my half sleeve and my older skin wouldn't handle the process without all the time that was given to me from Chris MacCharles.  He has a lot of pride in his work and I would recommend him to anyone who wants a high end tattoo from someone who is a true professional.  If your a first timer or want another tattoo take a look at his work, go in and see his pictures he will be glad to give you the time....Thank you Chris, your the man!!!!  Will post pics when i heal...thanks  Khristie< /review><user_name>Khristine Brown<//user_name>< response>

I have been tattooed over the years at a lot of socal tattoo shops. this shop got a new owner and a lot of new artists this year and changed from king spades to breakthrough tattoo. this location has been a tattoo shop for over 10 years and it has really turned around since my last visit. I think their prices are fair and i got helped right away when i came in to get a price on some background for my sleeve. ive had 2 appointments there and i will be returning soon to get more ink. i suggest this shop to anyone whos had a bad experience elsewhere. Overall, good service, clean, fair prices, and relaxing vibe. lots of cute girls come through too so its a nice way to take my mind off the pain.<//text>

They have a piercing sign yet no piercer. Maybe you guys should turn off the piercing sign or take it down.</Review>

Dr. Cheng is an excellent and caring dentist. He’s professional and conscientious with his work. Tina does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth. She points out things to help improve my dental care. Everyone is personable and very pleasant. Highly recommend.< /text>

Very thorough!  My co-worker recommended me to Dr. Chen and the team after a couple sub-par past experiences I've had with other dentists and I have been very impressed with everything so far.  I feel comfortable after my treatments because of  the attention to detail.< /review>

The dentist and his team are wonderful.

The next time I go in for a cleaning, I will no lounger  feel dread and anxiousness beforehand.

I used to go to Stacey Lowman which is also wonderful, but unfortunately had to switch practices due to insurance. I tried out Marina Smiles, which was the worst experience ever!

Thankfully I chose to go to Beach Plaza Dental. Could not be more pleased.

Everyone is very friendly and professional. Prompt and caring. This was my third visit and the dentist actually comes to see you every six months. Honest and very welcoming. Can’t say enough good things about this very gentle team.< /Text>

Today I visited Dr Cheng for the first time. I am terrified of going to the dentist, and was so anxious to go today. But to my complete and utter surprise, it was a wonderful, relaxed and pleasant experience. I didn’t feel pressured to do a lot of work, and got a practical and factual overview.  I’m going back for a cleaning followed by a crown replacement.
So far, so good!!</Review>

Professional service from all staff as well as Dr.Cheng. Gentle yet thorough, and great explanations/recommendations were given.  My husband and I are new to the area and we’re greatly impressed.< /text>

<Text>My husband and I both came to Dr. Cheng after not being able to get into the dentist for quite some time due to the pandemic. The entire staff were so kind and knowledgeable and helped take care of me and my husband. I have to give a special shout out to Nina--I felt like I had known her my entire life! Not only is she an expert and the best dental hygienist I've ever been to (not an exaggeration), but she is so kind and our talks about Hawaii made me feel right at home. Thank you to Erin, Nina, Dr. Cheng and all of the other staff for a wonderful experience!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>First-class people and first-rate care!  Dr Cheng, Leah, Erin, Melinda, Ben and anybody else I might have overlooked deserve my highest regards for the work they do and for how pleasant and professional they all are.  For well over 20 years I have had no reason to look elsewhere for dental care.<//review>< Pictures>

My visit at Beach Plaza Dental was, like always, the best. I have a tooth ache so I want to get it taken care of as quick as possible. I called Monday and I got an appointment to see Dr. Cheng Tuesday, the next day.  Malinda is the best receptionist, she make you feel welcome the moment you arrive. To tell you the truth the whole staff there at Beach Plaza Dental is  great, friendly and professional. I highly recommend Beach Plaza Dental.< /Text>

<userid>106522570406905823890< /userid><review>Dr. Cheng is a fantastic dentist (and I've unfortunately had to see many dentists over the past 40 years).  He is very thorough and very careful (and extremely good) at keeping you comfortable and pain free.  However, if you aren't doing a decent job keeping your teeth clean he's going to let you know!  Personally, I greatly appreciate this.  He is very honest and has a very good sense of humor.  He also takes great pride in his work and spends the extra time to try and make things as perfect as possible.  Dr. Cheng is the best!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>My wife and I are new to California.  We were recommended to Dr. Cheng and are we glad!  He is amazing...a true professional and a most caring Dentist.  My wife had a huge problem with an infected tooth, right around Christmas.  Dr. Cheng came into the office after hours and took care of the problem and ensured she would have a pain free Christmas.  The office staff is friendly and welcoming.  Love, Love, Love Aricely (I hope I spelled that right) the hygienist and Ben.  Great, Great, Great office.</review>< Rating>

<Text>There is no better Dentist than Beach Plaza! Melinda is always friendly, courteous
and efficient. Jan, my dental hygenist, is always cheerful, friendly, efficient and painless. Dr. Cheng is the most pain free dentist I have ever known. When he gives injections, rather than jam the needle in, he takes the time to slowly deaden the injection site. Being retired and living on a fixed budget, I have found that he is very considerate about not performing work that does not need to be done.

I give Beach Dental my highest recommendation without reservation!</Text>< pictures>

My husband and I met Dr. Cheng about ten years ago, and for the first time in our lives, we actually look forward to our dental appointments. Dr. Cheng has done an outstanding job of creating a welcoming environment and selecting highly professional staffers who serve each client with the utmost care and respect. He has gone out of his way to help us when we have had unexpected dental problems; even apart from the normal work day hours. Our decision to select Dr. Cheng as our dentist is one of the best decisions in our life. We know we can always trust his recommendations and rely on his highly skilled work.

< review>
I found this dental office to be professional, friendly and efficient.  Dr. Cheng was thorough with my evaluation and took time to explain any recommendations that he had.

Jan, the hygienist took care of my cleaning without causing me bleeding as other hygienist have done so it the past.  She was supportive of my care and offered a suggestion to improve my hygiene.

Ben was excellent and friendly while taking my xrays.
Melinda, the front office gal who keeps everything running smoothing, was friendly, helpful and professional.

Overall, I found everything to be satisfactory including the wonderful pictures of significant icons from around the world.  I also appreciated the fact that as a 5'3" woman,  the dental chair fit my stature and was quite comfortable.  Although my appointment was 10:40, a glass of champagne would have been nice :)

Sincerely,
Dr. Jeanne Haislett Pontac< /review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>unprofessional,  bad service!!!!!
My sister and I came here last week and will not be returning. I had my eyebrows waxed and a manicure. As I was getting my brows done the lady was on her phone and only using one hand. She then stopped in the middle of the service and used her phone for a long time, having me wait until she felt like resuming her work. As for my sister, another lady was doing her manicure. While doing her nails the lady called another two co-workers making comments about her hands. I perceived that the conversation was about negative comments. To top this Non-professional/ poor quality service at the end when it came time to pay the lady took the money out of my hand without my consent as I was looking inside my bag for the remaining cash.
Overall it was bad service and unprofessional. I won't be returning.</Text><Name>Mirian Rojas< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>Very RUDE staff, VERY BAD service. Me and my mom went to go get our eyebrows done, and were pushy to get our upper lip waxed as well. My mom does not know english very well, yet in the middle of my eyebrow waxing, they take my mom into a different room to get her eyebrows waxed and waxed her upper lip without her consent. I can hear my mom telling them "No! Stop!" and they did not stop. After, they wanted to charge us for upper lip although we did not want it. We started arguing, and the worker named Luna started to call me and my mom "Men" Never going back!!</review>< pictures>

She does a great job with minimal instruction leaves your nails looking perfect and the best part is that they last with all the work I do with my hands these nails take a punishment at keep looking great. Red is my color and if you look carefully at these days are ruby red.

I got a full set, I showed them what I wanted and asked if they could help me find a nail color close to the one I want, the guy ended up being rude and just kind of threw the basket with the swatches of gel nails at the table and told me to pick one. He didn't take the time to property prep my nail. I asked for coffin shape and he gave me half coffin and half square. when I was done and paying (paid with debit) the lady who was charging me asked me if I wanted to give him a tip WHY WOULD I TIP SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T DO WHAT I PAID FOR!!!! Never going there again. Defiantly would not recommend getting a set there<//Text>

Most of all the nail polish wasn't so nice neither was the design. Usually when you come out of a nail spa your nails look fresh. Not this place. Plus the lady seemed to be in a bad mood.

Good work, just be careful with hidden fees. They offer to do things, but don’t mention the extra fees, they try make it seem if it is part of what you asked for.< /Review>

I came in here to get a pedicure I asked if I had to wait a long time they told me no and that up waiting 30 minutes what they did was sent me down in one of the chairs put my feet in the water and then after that day I had to wait until they actually finished with one of the customers and that's basically something I didn't want to do so I think they're very deceiving in the way they try to get you to stay instead of being honest and telling you that there is a 10-minute wait 20 minute wait 30 minute wait that's one of the things that I don't like about this place.<//Text>

Wasn't satisfied with the outcome of the service. My nail tech was very friendly and polite but, the nails started popping off 4 days later. To top it off the price was way too much especially since they did pop off way to fast.< /text>

Manager is very disrespectful. Made me wait to fix my nails that were poorly done by them. When manager was fixing them she was looking at a show on her phone instead of paying attention to my nails.  Nails came out worse then what they already were. Not only did I go back to get them fixed but 2 other ladies showed up with complaints about their nails while I was there.<//review>

I swear I will NEVER come here again I got a guy name Paul who was ok at first, but then when it came to making my nails matte he couldn't do it, he kept putting layer after layer of matte coat and it kept coming out shiny/matte so he spent another 20 minutes wasting my time, and at the end for him to just say oh you can leave it will turn matte later... I told him no just take it off and just make it regular gel and he gave me a hard time and he didn't even offer a dam discount and told me next time I come not to get matte.. who says that ! NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN.</Text>

<text>They're always close when I go!  -_-*

It's claims to be 9:30pm on Google,  but they really are only open till 8. Waste of my time!  They need 2 learn to update their stuff,  not just in the store, but online too if they plan on making and not losing out on clients.< /text>< Pics>

Although everyone is entitled to their own review and many of them are true, this is just a convenient place to go to after you've shopped and pick up your feet for an hour or 30 minutes & have a little pampering. It's NOT the best place to go to when you expect Alot but its just Ok. P.s. I refuse to let ANY of the men do my nails. TOO many mistakes😡
FYI if you have a fav person, Stick with her 0nly!! And you should be ok!<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>To clarify, this is the nail salon in walmart.

Now, im not the one to put up bad reviews but, i have to give you guys what i have experienced in the past few months.
I've been coming here since i was 13. Now turning 23 and i have to say, this is by far the worst year of manicure/full set service. They are now working to get as many clients as possible and not focusing on the quality of nails. They rush me almost every time even tho they know me and my family. They dont fix any mistakes unless you speak up the 3rd time. they are to aggressive when it comes to filing. I have went home with cuts in almost every finger and will be bruised for days. they nitpick any kind of service to earn extra money. For example, if you accidentally ruin the polished nail, they charge 2 bucks. Its so sad how i use to tell my friends to go here for great nails ... but they show mediocre work.

I will say tho, the only person i can trust to do my toes is Moon♡ she is so cute and amazing and she can take care of you

Its not the same Nail Salon i use to love. They rush for money and free time, not to make you happy. Thats what i see at least< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I called around to different nail salons in my area and they were all more then I wanted to pay for a full acrylic set and I tried calling one more salon before giving up and I found Nailport Express for $15 and after I left I wasn't pleased. I had alot of the powder needed to be filed so I went back 30 minutes later and the guy who did my nails complained and was doing a fast fix and I had to tell him a second time alot weren't right and still needed fixing and he said this is the last finger and I am done and you go. How rude and unprofessional. I was so unhappy. So I waited two weeks and went to another salon. When I went to another salon the women noticed my nails weren't right and were ugly so she asked where I went and I told her and she told me alot of people complain about the men who work at the Walmart nail salon and that they keep changing management. So please DONT go to Nailport Express inside Walmart on Washington and Paramount in Pico Rivera. They may be cheap in price but they aren't worth the work and service they do. TERRIBLE.<//Text>< pictures>

I went with my daughter and we both got full sets. The nail tec cut me 7 time's and my daughter's nail's were uneven. We went there because it was a place that was referred to me that they do a good job.. Never again will I go there. One star was being nice. Then the nail tec wanted a tip. I laughed.</Review>

I went to do my eye brows the and they came out horrible. She did not take her time due to her being worried about other customers. Being in a rush and worrying more about money she ended up losing money because she lost a customer. The service was horrrible !!! By the way her name was Tammy</Review>

These guys do it with class and at a affordable price. Don't judge a book by it's cover, might seem like a questionable establishment to the judgement eye. But if my pup is willing to walts on in with no objection, these guys are doing there job.</Review><Rating>5</Rating><time>1554784263008</time></record>

Took our really fluffy and nervous pup for a day at the spa. It was seamless and efficient. I love that this place is a family business and has the mom and pop feel, they really care about the animals and you can tell by the happy and friendly dogs that are on standby to get groomed or are waiting to be picked up. The staff was really kind and down to earth. We will definitely be returning here.</review>

<review>Groomers are very kind, even after my 3rd visit the service and attention to my dog has been very consistent.

I am so grateful to have their service throughout the quarantine. Highly suggest this groomer within the SSF area.<//review>< rate>

<Review>Nothing fancy but gets the job done. $70 for a grooming ( ouch!) is kinda peppy for this hood. Right around corner from other stores so you could waste some time while waiting..or drive to nearby Tanforan Mall.<//Review>< Pictures>

NO LIABILITY INSURANCE + NO CAMERAS.  This is what I learned after I took my dog there and picked her up with a $7k surgery bill for a torn ACL.  Most times your dog should be fine...but if you're unlucky like me, you've been warned.  I simply don't understand why they wouldn't "protect" themselves from no fault "accidents" by having a $100 camera system...oh yea, they specifically DECLINED liability insurance when working with live animals...makes sense now.</text>

Very friendly, knowledgeable staff. They are always so nice to all the animals I see there. My long haired chihuahua had never had a haircut in 10 years and she knew exactly what to do!< /text>

They do a great job, nice people, convenient location, and my doggy got an excellent hairdo 😍 They also did a great job trimming her face, and removing the hair from the ear canals as the vet recommended. She was in good spirits when I picked her up 1 1/2 hours later. It took a couple weeks to get an appointment but it was worth it.</Text>

I have never brought our dog to a groomers before so this was our first experience. Our dogs hair grows took a particular length and doesn't need trimming. They just gave him a bath and brushing. He came back so soft and smelling so good. It was definitely more expensive than I expected.<//review>

Amazing to say the least! All the people who work here went out of their way to make my dog Kobie my Samoyed beautiful. From the whitening shampoo to the anal glands cleaned. Even cut and shaved him correctly. I was surprised when I call the day before Thanksgiving and I was despite because my dog ran at the beach through the puddles. And he was so knotted in his coat. They did a beautiful job...I highly recommend them 100%! Better than Pet Co at Tanforan by far and Pet Smart too! I am impressed.... because if you know this or not...a Samoyed has a double coat and their hair locks up in dreadlocks. They really did an amazing job. Oh did I say they even put a Thanksgiving scarf around his neck! Thank you for giving me a beautiful salon job on my dog! He was gorgeous. I will bring my other Samoyed to you next!<//text>

< Review>
Bruce And Jose Are Amazing!

Please, please, give this particular Boomerang's food and service a try, you won't regret it at all! The fried zucchini was the biggest portion for an appetizer I've ever had, the fresh garlic in the mashed potatoes, just perfect, and the chicken wings were very generous in portion size.

The service was something I haven't been given since the 1970's or 80's; so personalized, friendly, and, they just made our short stay like being at home.  And, for me, that means a lot.

I'm going to make Boomerang's a regular stop!<//Review>

They have build your own burgers that you can even add ingredients to the burger itself before cooking. The sauces, so good. Their drinks are the best! So yummy and quality, definitely strong though so be warned :D
They even have an extensive whiskey collection.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Very very good burgers. Make your own with 3 ingredients or select from a tasty chef choice. Very good selection of side dishes.. You pay for them but they are worth it. Small place but nice atmosphere.  Just wish it was a little cleaner especially in the current health climate. Bathroom was a germ/ filth factory. Service was polite courteous and productive. If you are out for a BIG elite burger this is the place. Maybe just get it to go.< /Review>

<Review>Outstanding! Must go!! The owners are simply wonderful, friendly,  and genuinely concerned for your safety and comfort.  We asked about eating outside as my husband is an ER nurse and they set up and prepared  a table for us that was separate!! They will be having more outside seating when restrictions are in place so this is a safe place to come eat.  And the food! My gosh,  what a selection!! Huge menu with so many fabulous and unique items. Love the build your own burger or mac n cheese options.  We ordered the kitchen sink burger and the chicken and bacon Mac and cheese.  Everything was very fresh, tasty and hot.  They don't salt everything so the subtle flavors of the food are just delicious. We will be back to try more, next time - the meatloaf!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

A very unique restaurant. It’s actually very large, with two floors, but all the customers and staff were upstairs, where there is a small bar and a handful of tables.

We ordered a couple of burgers, with fries and onion rings. Everything was quite good. The buns were thin and crisp, and the lettuce and tomatoes were extremely fresh. I especially liked the pickles.

The staff was awesome. Very helpful and friendly.< /Text>

<Text>This place is a hidden, eclectic gem, literally. Tucked away, behind another restaurant and upstairs. The food was great and the service was fun. They love their regulars and definitely appreciate new visitors such as me and my family. It's not for everyone, but I recommend giving the place a try.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLI9xwkdJyazwj5FvlXCmzlVvxVpy2jb1QZ4YQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Name>

Boomerang was invented in Philippines or was it in Australia!

Gourmet hamburger called Boomerang!  Sure, customers will return!

Well, if this place serves excellent food then it will stay open!

Eat meat!

I do not recall visiting a year ago so I give 5 stars since every man and woman was intended to be created perfect in the beginning!

Let me start by qualifying my review. We had our ordered delivered during the shelter-in-place and that certainly impacted the quality of burger we received.

I ordered the ABC Burger. I love burgers and have been eyeing Boomerang's for a while. However, when it arrived, the food was lukewarm and the lettuce was wilted. I barely ate half the burger before hitting a point where I didn't want to eat anymore (because of the flavor/texture). I am willing to give this place another shot when we are able to dine in.

My wife got the Grilled Blackened Chicken Mac N Cheese. This was also a bit cold but the flavor was great. I would eat this dish again for sure.<//Text>

<Review>I was a little leery when we arrived, it was quiet and I thought nobody was here because it was not so good. NOT THE CASE. I ordered an Angus Beef Burger and twice baked mashed potatoes, IT WAS DELISH! Food was amazing atmosphere matched, very lively shortly after we arrived the place filled up and happy sounds filled the air. We have lived in SD for five and a half years, the burger was the best I’ve eaten since moving here.
Thank you for good food, atmosphere and service...
Definitely a spot to repeat, classic hidden treasure!</Review>< pictures>

I am totally shocked and can NOT believe the way these people spoke to me on the phone. I ordered a grub hub order at 6:30pm. It was scheduled to be delivered between 7:25-7:35. A driver never came to pick up my order from the restaurant if it’s 7:50-8:00 am a driver hasn’t picked up the order then you should be calling grub hub. When I called the restaurant I asked how far they were from Mira Mesa Blvd as I am not here from here from. I am from out of state. Two different males on the phone argued with me called me a snot and were extremely rude! I work in customer service! If you guys are 5 miles from this hotel the right thing to do would be to bring me my order. And I was willing to take tip off grub hub order and give to them! He insisted I cancel and did not want to make my order. I have NEVER been spoke to by anyone in the restaurant industry.<//review>

Wonderful portions! Exceedingly nice and friendly staff. Good sides. Meat cooked to the actual temperature you request and served hot. Child-friendly. Really good tasting food. Not too crowded. Do you want to really good hamburger? Really good appetizers and sides? Make the trip over there, you will not go wrong! 😊😊 Kiss, kiss!</text>

They gave my gf the wrong burger and since it was a to go order we didn't know until we were on the road. Wirh that being said the to go order also has my chili cheese fries but the chili came in a separate container to prevent them from getting soggy. It was ok but I would have preferred it to just be made. It created more confused.<//review>

Holy smokes this place is incredible. When you pull up outside you aren't really sure what to expect, but it was by far the best burger I have had. To top it off, the service is fantastic. The owners/waiters are friendly and so willing to take care of you. I will definitely be going back!< /Review>

One of San Diego’s truly hidden gems. Been visiting for years and look forward to coming back. The staff are all amazing and polite people that treat you like family. The decor has a San Diego vibe that chain restaurants cannot replicate. Local art, cool decor, and friendly staff.. why are you still reading this and not pressing start directions!?< /Review>

This place is great!  Went here prior to going to the movies with friends.  The staff is very friendly and warm with great service.  The food is wonderful.  Burger's are the best, homemade potato chips were the bomb!  The drinks were amazing, even the coffee was good.  We will be returning again.< /text>

Best hamburger in town hands down! At first you think is this place upstairs? Yep it sure is. Then you think is this a real waiter? Yep it is you should have seen him at Christmas! Then you slowly meet everyone working there and it's like a great feeling of home in a weird way cause you feel like you've stepped into another realm. Anyways the food choices are outstanding and wait til you try the burgers! The best superbly the best! Who would have thought this place existed tucked away upstairs!!<//Review>

<Review>This was such a fun place to discover. The service was fantastic, the food was good, and the atmosphere was spot on. They also had a large menu with lots of options. The burger was perfectly cooked and my lemon garlic shrimp was so fresh and delicious. Many choices of beers and a cider on tap! Plus, a great happy hour. They checked every box.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Such a great place. My date took me there for the first time. My burger was amazing and so flavorful. I ordered the bad breath burger and garlic herb fries. My date ordered the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries. The appetizer was fried calamari.

The food was delicious and I was super full. The owners are really nice and very hospitable. Will for sure go back again.<//Review>

Wow, this place is phenomenal. The burgers were large, flavorful, unique, and well made. The onion rings, fries, and Mac n cheese were equally delicious. Staff was super friendly. Go here!</text>

They have a bar, as well as table seating. Quite a variety of menu options. I tried a burger and some grilled vegetables for lunch...they were delicious. Definitely will visit again when I'm nearby.<//Text>< Pictures>

Your go-to neighborhood burger joint! I love this place. The staff is extremely friendly and will cater to whatever you want. They have a pretty cool bar as well.  They always have a few options on tap and the mixed drinks are huge. I usually walk here and enjoy a few drinks, eat a nice juicy burger, and watch whatever game they happen to be showing on TV.< /text>

Not gonna lie, I was a little skeptical at first but I am a big fan of SD dive joints. The food and service are amazing. The burgers are fresh and actually cooked the way you order it. Hands down to the staff here and the best part my 6 year old cleared his plate. Whoot whoot!<//Review>

This is a cool and laid back restaurant that is tucked away and easily missed from the street. They have a good selection of craft beers on tap, and their burgers at top-notch. Boomerangs lets you customize your burgers with mix in, toppers, sauces, and seasoning. Worth the visit for good food, beer, and atmosphere.</Review>

I met Bruce and Jose  , the owners,  a couple years ago when friend Eileen brought me there. I immediately felt like part of their family. They are the kindest guys you could ever know. The food they have on their menu is warm and family friendly that you would rival anybody's moms cooking.
I really love all the burgers..Especially the BAD BREATH.  LOL
ALSO....best Fish and Chips, and the Boom boom Shrimp.
I always order the Ceasar Salad because it sooo Fresh.
I have many more things on their menu I still wanna try. Love you guys 😎<//review>

If you love hamburgers, you MUST try this place! They have every topping, spice, sauce combination for your burger and a good selection of ales.  I enjoyed the roasted garlic parmesan fries!  I came here at 3 in the afternoon, so no counting for Grace under fire, but the burger tasted great.</Text>

The atmosphere is great, its not what you would expect for how good it is though. They have TVs displaying sports or news or whatever else, which doesn't really bother me one way or the other. The owners are the nicest people. They love to come and talk to you like you were a close friend, which is amazing. They are down to earth, and love to hear your honest feedback. They are always thinking up new ideas to make the customers happier.

Their location is a bit strange, and its easy to miss where you pull in. I am a new driver though, and I could do it easily. The location has a very homey feel to it, which I adore.

So! The food. Their menu, which I heard that they are freshening up a bit, looks a little daunting. It isn't. It is in big font, which makes it easy to read, but makes it look kinda like the menu is bigger than it is. What I got this last time was the make your own burger. You get to choose your meat, cheese, toppings, insides of the burger, your side, the works. I got my burger medium rare, and it was delicious. I have leftovers waiting for me in the fridge it filled me up so well! (They've even won awards as far as I know!)

These wonderful people need to see some more love. They are incredible, and so very sweet. We need to get the news out there about them.

I hope my review helped with the decision to eat there!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Looking for great food, friendly atmosphere and drinks worth your time and money. This is a the place for just you, a family dinner or a party. My favorite, a 1/2 lb buffalo burger with all the trimmings and a side of hot corn with mexican cheese. The menu alone is great reading with bring you back choices.< /Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Boomerang's is a unique burger joint in the Clairemont Mesa area. It's not very noticeable from the main road, and even from the parking lot, the entrance is hidden away in a little courtyard. First, the criticisms: The building seems older and not well taken care of. This is emphasized by the hodgepodge decorations (but not in a good way). There was also no music (though I did notice ceiling speakers), which contributed to making the ambiance awkwardly quiet since there were few guests when we went and the restaurant is surprisingly large. On the positive side, our waiter (Jose) was very friendly and attentive. I had a 1/2lb Bad Breath Burger with Chilli Pepper Onion Rings. I love garlic; so, having garlic mixed into the Patty was amazing. Staying true to it's name, the cheese of choice is gorgonzola, and it is slathers with just enough fresh horseradish. Grilled onions galore top the creation, and on the side comes a creamy garlic-horseradish mayo. The Chilli Pepper Onion Rings have a wonderful crunch and get an added kick by the jalapeno topping. It comes with habanero ketchup which is good, though not as spicy as I hoped for, given the name. Overall, it's a delicious meal in an okay space. But, I think it's worth a shot!</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc0058556d6483:0xc63269d1910bc67e< /gmap_id></record>

The hamburger menu is too complicated. Not just for the guests, but for the server and the cook too. The bacon on the burger was excellent  even still, the order did not come out right, but they fixed it. The food looked great, but not seasoned enough, it was kind of bland. But there was a lot of food, they did not skimp on the serving!</review>

Clever idea. Very "creatively" decorated, and even more creatively staffed. It's not Red Robin, it's not Island's. it's a mix of both burger styles with a smidge of neighborhood flair.< /Text>

Tastiest burger I've ever had! I got the 1/2 lb angus burger with bacon, mushrooms, and garlic cooked into it. Absolutely delicious! The mac n cheese was homemade and great! Staff was very friendly and explained everything and made suggestions. I'm definitely going back for more. Next time with friends< /Text>

Sooooo many different things on the menu it's a bit overwhelming!

The sides we had were both great, especially the onion rings!

Two negatives that knock it down to 4 stars - the beer was warm :-( maybe it was due to it being 100 degrees out, but still unacceptable. Second there was no one on the first floor to greet us so we just kind of wandered around until we figured out we had to go upstairs.

Super weird dive place. Love the drinks, atmosphere, funkiness. Food is way bad and overpriced though. Too bad.<//Text>

My burger tasted great but it was showed to be tasting like garlic horseradish and gorgonzola which was difficult to detect. The garlic cries were very garlicky. Our other burger didn't taste like the blue cheese that it was supposed to be stuffed with. The onion rings were good service prompt and friendly<//review>

<Text>Just walked out after my misunderstanding that their burgers were stuffed (rather than placing your additions on top). Both gentlemen at the counter immediately wanted to help and we're all positivity. I appreciate the patience and the deliciousness! Thank you Boomerangs crew on Sunday evening, July 10th :)</Text>< Pictures>

Service was always SLOOOW. We went here a couple of times (mainly since it’s close) and the food was meh, until the last time when I found dirt on the lettuce of my burger. Bigger than my thumb and thick enough you couldn’t see through it. Yuck. When we finally found the manager he shrugged like it was normal and didn’t even apologize. Eater beware.<//text>

Fairly good food. Seems as though most food was from scratch including some of the best mozz sticks I've tried. Server was friendly and efficient if not exactly knowledgable.  Decor was some nice original art that was also for sale.< /review>

The food was horrible. The service was lacking and inattentive.

-Cold hot wings
-Cold, old-frozen-food-tasting cheesesticks
-Cold jalapeno poppers
-The driest burger you've ever had
-Flat soda to drink
-The beer cheese soup looked like they dumped feta cheese in it and tasted like stale bread

The owner was apologetic and comped my appetizer, entree and soup and took 1/2 price off my wife meal because we did not eat any of it nor did we want to take it home.

Never ever coming back here again.<//Review>

The angus burgers (halal) are pretty much the only thing i tried. Kinda dry tbh, maybe cause im not choosing something right. The 3/4 pound will fill u up though.<//text>

We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees with salads. Approx 68 bucks with 15% tip.
The salads were ok. The rest of the food was awful.
I called the restaurant to see if the chef had a stroke or something, and let them know the food was well below expectations.
The man who answered the phone interrupted me repeatedly and said I was being "mean" when I told him the mac and cheese was a soggy old inedible mess with separated cheese sauce- totally microwaved.
He declared that all was "made to order" and when I suggested he hire a new chef (I have to now assume I was speaking to the sensitive chef?) he tried to blame the yelp eat24 driver on the poor quality food.
I'll post pics of the Philly cheesesteak- lettuce and tomatoes- whyyy?? And a big ole hunk of overdone steak, apparently couldn't be bothered to slice it thin- or at all.
Burger- super soggy bun. When an order is going out for delivery you should know how to package it.
And the worst offender- which made me put down my fork and start this review- the mac and cheese. Disgusting. Mushy, greasy, separated sauce and pasta was cooked to death.
Calamari- frozen strips. I want rings and tentacles, you know- real food.
All of it was flavorless and overdone. Huge portions of low quality product. Oh boy!<//text>

Didnt even eat there. I walked in with my wife and two children. They greeted us and showed us to a table. We looked on floor and there was dog poop all over the floor. Thats is un sanitary and un sat for a restraunt. I will never even consider going back there!!!</Review>

Linh is by far the best nail expert I have ever had! There is no design or nail job too complicated for her. Prices are very reasonable compared to her quality of work. This is the place to go if your looking for quality top nails without the high prices!!</text>

<review>They have the MOST horrible customer service. Took my daughter to get her nails and feet done for her birthday the lady they asked to do her feet walked up and frowned at my daughter so I politely asked her is she ok with doing children because of the look on her face. I told them it was ok we will wait for someone else and all of a sudden NO ONE else is available to do any perdicures because all of a sudden they all have “APPOINTMENTS” for the rest of the day. Smfh. Total waste of time<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1625695793129, 'text': 'Dear Lady! First of all I’m apologize for your time .

< review>
Got a fill done with a lady that sits in the far back of the salon, next to the toilet. She was really rough with my hands and told me my hands were tense and that I needed to put my phone away and focus. Focus on what? Focus on you twisting my wrists and fingers all kinds of directions and hurting me? Or focus on you throwing my hands left and right, or perhaps focus on the terrible job you did on my nails? By the time my nails were done, my nails were bubbly, wrinkled, uneven and hideous. The bumpy, thick clear coat was smeared on unevenly. I showed the manager and she said "those are bubbles." It's shameful that the manager didn't offer to redo my nails or at least give me the cash that I had already paid. By the way they ask for payment before they start the paint job on your nails here. It's most likely because they know they are going behave grotesquely and want the money up front.< /review>

After reading some of the good reviews, i decided to come here.  I absolutely fell in love with Lee.  She's amazing at what she does.   Granted its a small place but ill take that over a cheap work place anytime.  Top it off, she takes her time on you, is not rude and is patient to tell you to pay.  Love it</text>

Had nails done by Lee  the manager She worked fast and feverishly on my nails and was complaining  about her workers taking too much time on  their customers My nails came out horrible and bumpy. Will not be returning. Prices are also not competitive with nail salons that give better service and pay attention to what they are doing.< /Review>

I was very happy with this salon. A couple of day prior I got my nails done at a different place and they were so ugly. I went it to Super Nail and asked if they can fix it the lady said she will try. I also got a pedicure. My pedicure was amazing. When it came down to fixing my nails I was very nervous. Once I told the lady what I wanted she was shocked how bad my nails looked. She did an amazing job and made my bad looking nails look exactly the way I wanted!! I was so happy and will definitely be returning back to this salon! Also they are very funny and not rude at all. Ignore all the other reviews.</review>

<name>Samantha Carothers<//name><review>Took my daughter in to get our nails done for her 8th birthday. One of the ladies started on my pedicure and said someone else would come do my daughter after she finished with the client she was working on. Well, when the other lady finished the first person she then took another, meanwhile my pedicure was finished and I was told my daughters would start soon and to move for my mani. The other lady ended up taking yet another person, and the girl that did my mani and pedi did my daughters after she finished mine. I was so tempted to walk out before my daughters nails were started, except it would not have been fair to her to sit so patiently for me, and not have her nails done as well. I felt as if my daughter was not seen as a priority because she is a child, and because of that will not be returning.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

The worst dip nail job I have ever received.  I was near the area thought how different can a nail salon really be? Wow! Very different!!!!! Its all gloppy uneven she even didnt want to clean the cuticles! When I insisted she said that's extra 3.00. Fine but I need clean then dip.  Worst experience ever! Even the worker agreed but it was the owner who did my nails so she just gave me a look like I'm sorry.   When I mentioned it to the owner she said it looks fine! So bad I stopped my pedicure and said I'm going somewhere else to have it removed! Looks like a 5 year old dud it! Horrible work and horrible customer service! If your want a dip manicure dont go here and dont let Lee the one touch it.  Waisted 35 dollars!!!!!!!< /text>

Not so great. My polish was old and dried up while the tech was applying it. It didn’t dry all that smooth and shiny afterwards. The sea salt stuff is in old used recycled containers like Vaseline grease containers and old ice cream container... uber ghetto if you ask me. The chairs are the least comfortable as are the water basins for pedi’s. The place is pretty small. There aren’t any fans to speed up the drying process. My feet aren’t rough but even after the pedi it felt no different from washing my feet in the shower... so the callous treatment was mediocre. Idk. Not used to this at all. I expected better considering I love our local canyon crest plaza. Oh well.

Oh. And my tech kept answering phones while doing my pedi. And not like the shop phone...her cell phone. Unprofessional.

I have to keep coming back to add to the review. They don’t have the little sandals for you to where after a pedi either. My goodness.< /text>

I absolutely love Lee! She is the most amazinh nail technician I have been to, and I have been to nail salons all over riverside county. Definately a hidden gem! I came in with holes from acrylics from a prior nail salon and she fixed everything! I am never disappointed with her work! I trust her 100% she always does an amazing job!< /review>

The prices are wayyy to high ! 45 for gel?? I’ve been getting my nails done for 4 years and I usually only pay 35. I got them done anyways bc she said she does them good but she was so rough and my finger nails were sore for days!</Review>

Worst customer service ever.
I had a gift card for a gel manicure and pedicure. I had to return to work so I only had time to do my manicure. The two girls there didn't know how to charge the gift card when it came time to pay. Thus we were at a stand still and I was on a time crunch. I felt bad for the girls so I said I would leave the gift card with them and at a later point to pick it up.

When I returned another day the manager (Lee) was there and not the girl I dealt with primarily (Kim). She said Kim was in Texas, didn't know anything about a gift card and would return the following Monday so I can deal with it then. Come Monday Kim claims she returned the card to me after charging me. A complete lie. She couldn't get a hold of her manager that day to know how to charge it but now claimed she did.

I feel so appalled that they would have the audacity to lie to my face and be as petty to hold onto the gift card because at this point I could care less about the money but simply about the principal of the matter. I'm sure if I were to return to inquire proof about the charge they supposedly made that day to the card, the truth would lie there.

I explained to them what they were doing was essentially stealing from me and that I would make a claim with the Better Business Bureau as minuscule the amount was.<//text>

<Review>This salon is:
1)  Dirty---needs an update
2)  Has poor air quality.  There appears to be be very poor air cirulation/ventilation and with the use of certain nail chemicals it is impossible to stay in here without feeling nauseous. The health affects on the customer and the workers long term must be dangerous!
3)  The owner appears to be cheap when it comes to using air conditioning. It has been stifling in there on warm days.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcafb16f09c7cd:0xf5eed351e2bdf8bc< /Gmap_id></record>

I've been here 3 separate times, 2 full sets and one spa pedi.  I've always had great work done.  It's a small salon so it may not be as spacious as other places but they do great work every time and they don't over price! :-)</review>

Very disappointed. Came in 2 weeks ago with nails in bad shape from another salon. Was told that my nails were paper thin, which they were. Proceeded to get a gel mani which was very painful, causing 3 of my fingers to bleed due to a tough cuticle cleaning. Pointed it out to manicurist. Went home and applied hydrogen peroxide to prevent infection.  Did not notice instruments coming out of sterile packages. Went back 2 weeks later. Was challenged by manicurist about when I was last there. I gave the exact date and was told I did not come in then. I had receipt to prove it. Then I asked that my cuticle grooming be gentle as last time I was cut. Manicurist became argumentative and defensive stating she didn't cut me last time and blamed the previous salon which had never cut my cuticles. Asked if I could try 2 colors prior to getting the gel color on. Was told rudely not to open the bottles. Did not even honor my request to try the colors out. Then began to speak in foreign language to another manicurist about my nails. Can only imagine what was being said. I almost walked out in the middle. There is no excuse for rudeness especially when you're at fault. This place is not cheap. Just apologize and maybe you won't lose customers. I gave it a second try because that's the kind of person I am but when I'm treated so badly I wont be back. I also won't recommend this place to my friends.</review>

<Review>Just came in as a walk in, my nails were a complete mess from another nail salon. I showed a picture of the shape I wanted my nails to the nail technician, Lee. I explained to her that my nails had been put on crooked, and had started to lift around the edges and snack on things. I had only had them done a week and a half and was slightly upset at the previous job since I had paid for three other mani-pedis, and they didn't fix what was wrong. Lee was professional and fast. She did a wonderful job and my nails look absolutely beautiful. I ended up going with an opaque coat on top of my stiletto nails, because they look so amazing. If you get the chance please go to this spot and get your nails done<//Review>< Pictures>

<name>Lukas George<//name><resp>None< /resp><review>Heiden, a sales specialist at Beverly Hills, is the worst sales person you can meet in a car dealership. Very rude, unprofessional, lack of knowledge, full of bluff, and more. I am going to buy several cars for my car collection, but I will go other dealerships now because of this one person. Good luck guys< /review>< Gmap_id>

My daughter and I walked into the showroom about 4pm 11/22/17 and not one person welcomed us nor looked up from their computers. They did however yell at my 11 year old for opening a car door, unacceptable to a prospective buyer! At that moment I decided even if they made the effort to speak with me they already lost a sale. After about 20 minutes in the showroom and still no contact with anyone, we left. Shame on you for such rude and inconsiderate behavior! I will make sure to give you as much bad publicity as possible for your rude treatment!<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Name>Livio Cacace</Name><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1522562754267<//time><Review>They let me step inside my favorite Lamborghini of all time and they are INSANELY NICE and I note them as "THE BEST LAMBORGHINI DEALERSHIP IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!" They are so nice! Big parking lot, tons of Lambos and Bentleys, but it was just epic. I HIGHLY recommend anyone who loves Lambos to go there since I have experience with the brand and all the specs. This is perfect! They have a GT3 Super Trofeo Evo, tons of AVENTADORS, 1 GALLARDO, 5 or 6 HURCANS, AVENTADOR PIRELLI EDITION, SV and that's it. SHOWROOM IS EXCELLENT! PERFECT CARS, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT! EVERYONE THERE IS EXTREMELY NICE AND FRIENDLY AND SOCIABLE AND THEY ARE THE BEST DEALERSHIP IF YOU EVER WANT TO STEP INSIDE YOUR FAVORITE LAMBO OR BENTLEY. IT'S YOU GO THERE EVERY INCE IN A WHILE. ON SATURDAY, MARCH 31,2018, I WENT THERE AND I TOLD THEM WHICH LAMBO I ALWAYS WANTED TO STEP INSIDE AND THEY HAD IT AND THEY OPENED THE DOORS FOR ME BUT I CLOSED IT AND OPENED IT MYSELF BECAUSE I KNIW HOW TO OPEN THE DOORS AND TOLD THEM EVERYTHING I NOTICE THAT IS NEW TO THE CAR AND THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT I KNEW THIS STUFF. TRUST ME,THE BEST LAMBO DEALERSHIP IN THE WORLD IS HERE. IF YOU LIKE NICE,FRIENDLY AND COOL DEALERS, THIS PLACE SUITS YOU ABSOLUTELY WELL AND IT'S GOOD FOR 11 YEAR OLDS WHO RIDE THEIR BIKES TO DEALERSHIPS THAT THEY LOVE. IT WAS SUCH A GOOD DAY BECAUSE OF THEM. LAMBORGHINI. YOU AWESOME DEALERS. KEEP DOING THIS TO OTHER CAR ENTHUSIASTS WHO LOVE LAMBOS AS MUCH AS I DO!!!!!!!

Thank you, Lamborghini, for being such great people and for letting me step inside a TRACK FOCUSED CAR. You guys really made my day. I hope you enjoyed this INSANELY EPIC REVIEW IN THIS EPIC DEALERSHIP. I HOPE TO COME BACK AGAIN.

Your true Lambo Enthusiast,

On May 11, 2017 at 4:45 I appeared at Service with an issue.  I was scheduled to run the Goldrush rally as car 01 the next day.  This dealership and service manager Michael Cosaert went far out of their way to say open into Friday evening and cool down my car... work on it... and fix it.  I cant tell you how happy I was.  The service they performed stuck.. the car performed perfectly for another 3000 miles, and its working now.  They impressed me with their customer service and their knowledge.  Lots of car dealerships use words like "family" and "loyalty" but this dealership means it.  I highly recommend them and I have a vast amount of experience in the Brand.

Our “Go to” for Mexican food in Simi.  Best chicken & tri-tip, so flavorful & moist. I stop by for a couple breasts all the time to have at home for lunch, snacks, & salads. They are lovely & great to deal with, fast service great food! Trying the pork chops tomorrow & catering for our grandsons birthday party!<//Text>

The Tri tip is the best in town!  The meat is juicy and tender!! We get a pound of it to go when I don't want to cook. Also, the rice, chips and salsa are great!!!</Review>

It's known for their Trip Tip burritos but they got other food food items as well. It's not exactly authentic Mexican Food but better than going to El Pollo Loco. They adapted their food for the general area in Simi Valley, which isn't a bad thing. Fast service and food customer experience.< /text>

Very tasty grilled chicken and tri-tip.  The employees are friendly and provide good customer service.  Definitely top choice for times when you don't feel like cooking, but still want the taste of a good home cooked meal.<//text>

I have been going to Pollo Corona for a while. Everytime I have gone it's been nothing but delicious.

The staff there are fast and friendly. They have not ever gotten my order wrong; even phone orders!</Review>

<Text>Best Mexican food in Simi Valley! It’s always packed but there’s never a long wait. They have Tri Tip, Chicken, veggies plates or you can get any of those options in one of the best burritos around. If you haven’t tried it you won’t be disappointed!</Text>< rating>

Great grilled meat.  Good salsa.  Tortillas were good if you want to make tacos with the meat and salsa.  Beans didn't look appetizing so i didnt touch.
Good prices. Good service.< /Review>

Great food, service was a little slow. Called an order in for pick up, I still ended up waiting 20 min. ( still, I was not that unhappy. Because the Tri Tip Quesadilla was so good!)< /text>

<Date>1513636139535</Date><Review>the place was clean, I'll give it that. the food wasn't good. they didn't have a good selection. and what Mexican place doesn't have cilantro?? no refried beans, the cheese in burrito wasn't melted. to top it off, the salsa was over powered by water tomato taste. I saw the good reviews and was extremely disappointed.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80e8292d3eac457d:0xe3737f599d7c97c7<//Gmap_id><user_id>101785422670261378548< /user_id><Pics>None</Pics></record>

This place is the best. It's hard to find authentic Mexican food in Simi Valley but here it is. The tri-tip is to die for! The burrito is good like a carne asada burrito but lately the sauce has been spicy so watch out! Also great homemade salsa. Good selection of Mexican bottled drinks as well as Fountain drinks. I love the spanish music, it's just like being at my Grandma's house. It doesn't get more authentic than this. I like the decor it's kind of Southwestern. Check it out you won't be disappointed.</text>

The chicken is very good. The burritos are huge and very good as well. If you have a few people get one of the combos with chicken, steak, and sides.< /Review>

The burrito was different, but in a good way. They have a very small menu. It's basically a couple of barbecue plates or burritos. I'd eat there again. The salsa was very good.<//review>

The burrito was different, but in a good way. They have a very small menu. It's basically a couple of barbecue plates or burritos. I'd eat there again. The salsa was very good.< /Text>
