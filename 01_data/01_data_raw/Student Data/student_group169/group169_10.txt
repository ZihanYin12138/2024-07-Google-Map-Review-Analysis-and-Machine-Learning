<text>I had a great experience here yesterday! This is a very clean gated facility. The property manager, Mike, was so courteous, professional, and pleasant to be around! He answered a ton of my questions, showed me a storage unit, and helped me fill out the paperwork to rent it. I was there for about an hour, but it felt more like 15 minutes. His customer service was superb!< /text>< Pictures>

I have rented public storages numerous times before and this facility is the one that highly recommend. Location and the facility is so perfect for people who reside in the radius of about 20miles. Also, the property manager, Mike, is very professional, helpful, and always willing to accodate your needs. For example, i had lost my keys to my storage lock and next day it was taken care of. I remember renting a space in La habra and it took about 2weeks and this was way before covid. I mean i have asked for the gate access for couple times and he was able to help without a hesitation. By far the best experience. Thats why i keep my space for over 2years. Affordable, clean, professional, great location, and zero complaints. Thanks</Text>

I don’t know why but I was kind of nervous because I never had a storage unit of my own, I’m always helping everyone else with there’s. Today at the facility off of Alondra, Mike in the front office was very helpful, friendly and polite. I came nervous and left at ease knowing Mike was who would be in the office if I ever needed help.< /Review>

<text>Your property WILL be stolen here... 2 weeks after we moved our stuff in it was stolen. They couldn't care less, actually said the person/people who were responsible were caught but no police report was filed by them. We still have no answers from Public Storage or Police. They asked if we had insurance which is laughable considering theft is not covered by them. No evidence was given to us... They did refund the lock that was compromised but forced us to buy another useless lock that we couldn't get a refund on. Place is a scam and it was probably an inside job BEWARE!!!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Today was my first time ever getting a rental storage and Diamond made everything go really smoothly not only was he helpful he was polite with GREAT costumer service. Im going on my 2nd month here and even though Diamond is not here Mike is doing an excellent job at maintaining a friendly yet helpful atmosphere here. I truly appreciate customer service such as Mike's. Not to many people have the ability to work with the public so with that being said I truly appreciate Mike's time and patience but most of all his professionalism and kindness.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Great customer service Regina was helpful and explained every detail of the paperwork, Regina answered all my questions and didn’t bother to take a second to think of the answer she surely knew the answer to all my questions instantly so sad there is only an option of 5 stars this location and it’s personal deserves at least 10 stars. I have to drive near 10 miles to get to my unit but it’s nothing to worry about when you know your personal belongings are in a safe place they have a great surveillance system and it gives me great peace of mind thanks guys and looking forward to see you guys around when I go visit 😊</review>< Pictures>

Cleared out my storage space and Regina was very helpful.  Although she wasn't very busy, she stopped her paperwork and immediately walked with me to my unit to ensure everything was alright and checked me out as soon as possible.  She gave me a hard copy of my receipt as well as an email copy.  The whole process was about 5 minutes.  Thank you for such speedy service!</Review>

Andrew and Regina were awesome!  I originally obtained a smaller storage unit, but when I went back to get my stuff, I realized it was way too small.  I had to get a larger one and Regina was able to find me the perfect fit! Thanks to both Andrew and Regina!  I'm sure I'll be very happy at La Mirada Public Storage!</text>

I called the 800 number and they were not helpful.

I came in to cancel my service and move my stuff because of the frustration from CSRep Chase at the 800 number but Alexis not only helped me but kept me as a client. She was on her way to lunch and got out of her car and delayed her lunch to help me❤👏👏👏

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Andrew is a very competent employee who seems to really care about the customers.  The facility is very clean and climate controlled. I would of giving them a 4+ star except the gate unit can only be accessed on foot which is no big deal except every single time you enter and exit. The other issue is the fact that they have had multiple break-ins recently. I know of at least 4 or 5 times (and probably more) in the last 6 months. That is not what you want from a place where you are storing your belongings.</review>

Public storage makes it easy. I didn't know what size I need until I spoke to John the manager at this public storage. he showed me the perfect size with a freak awesome prices and it gets better with a $1 for the first month. its really clean and the temperature inside is perfect as well. Come down here asap if you need a storage<//review>

I just want to thank John the manager at this public Storage. He took the time with me to show me three units and I was glad to say that purchase a unit. He also shown me some great products to help protect my belongings from dust and stuff. Great place and perfect location to storage my belongings. Highly recommended. Thanks John</Review>

This was my first time renting a storage space. The minute I spoke to Eric on the phone, hearing his friendly and professional voice put me at ease. I had many questions and he was able to answer them all and even offered his advice. I reserved a space, went down to the location to check it out and Eric introduced himself and before I paid he made sure to see if the space I was renting was big enough for my stuff and he even took me to the space just so that I can see it for myself. He showed me how to lock it, what other products I may need and so forth. He made sure all my answers and concerns were answered and cleared before renting and before leaving, That's how I knew I picked the right place to store my stuff. Eric has impeccable customer service skills, he's attentive to his customer's needs and wants, and a very reliable person. He calls me when he has concerns or just to check up on me to see if I am satisfied with storage space and experience. Heck yeah I am! Thank you Eric for everything. I will recommend family, friends and coworkers to your store if they're ever in need of a storage space.</text>

Andrew arranged my storage unit and was very accommodating for the space I needed. He showed me a few different spaces as I expressed a need to have a cheap space with easy access to the parking lot.  Andrew gave me the best space for an even better price while also placing my unit right next to the doorway to the parking lot. Thank you Andrew!<//Text>

The manager John. Was very helpful. I already have a unit and I just came inside to get some stuff to help protect my stuff from the rain today. He suggested some tarps and rope to help secure the tarps down to our truck. To not get things wet. Thanks John for patients.<//Text>

<Review>I showed up here this morning in need of a unit last minute. Lynne was in the office at this time to assist me. I had stressed the urgency and the fact I had a moving truck and movers with me waiting to unload the truck and she told me she would do everything in her power to complete the registration process quickly. That's exactly what it was, a speedy process! Lynne offers great customer service and was able to pretty much answer all of the questions I had before I even had the chance to ask!

Thanks Lynne!
Hope you have a great day!< /Review>< Rate>

I enjoyed public storage. Friendly staff, clean establishment, very well price unit for the sizes.  Sucks to be leaving but once you by a big enough house there is no need for a storage. But I do recommend coming here to La Mirada.<//Review>

Extra Cost of insurance and lock was unexpected, the only downside. Ps bring your own lock if you can since it’s $20 per lock. Insurance is mandatory but not bad, lowest is $11. Worker was friendly, answered all my questions, and offered a cart to use during my move, environment is clean. Recommended to anyone around the area looking for storage place!</Text>< Pics>

I love this place! Even tho it’s not a home, it still makes me feel like I can trust my stuff here. Lisa is one of the sweetest person you could ever talk with. I remember it was raining and the systems were running a little slow, totally understandable. There was this man who was being very rude to worker and just the way that they continued the transaction with a smile on there face. They keep a close eye on the traffic flow moving in and out to ensure our stuff safety. This is the place you wanna be for any storage or even to purchase moving supplies, because man do they got some killer deals.

Just stopped in to pay my bill and I know that the workers switch stores so they see new faces everyday. Denise was there again with a smile on her face and even remembered me from last time. You guys always find the best staff in the world. Thank you Denise for being so special and making people feel good about them self’s.<//text>

<review>I love this place! Even tho it’s not a home, it still makes me feel like I can trust my stuff here. Lisa is one of the sweetest person you could ever talk with. I remember it was raining and the systems were running a little slow, totally understandable. There was this man who was being very rude to worker and just the way that they continued the transaction with a smile on there face. They keep a close eye on the traffic flow moving in and out to ensure our stuff safety. This is the place you wanna be for any storage or even to purchase moving supplies, because man do they got some killer deals.

Just stopped in to pay my bill and I know that the workers switch stores so they see new faces everyday. Denise was there again with a smile on her face and even remembered me from last time. You guys always find the best staff in the world. Thank you Denise for being so special and making people feel good about them self’s.< /review>< pics>

I have rented a unit three years in a row here and have never had an issue. Lisa is AMAZING! She is super, super, super helpful, and very friendly. My lock fell into the door and she helped me to unscrew the door and get it out! What a gem. The facility is so clean, and well kept. 11/10, would highly recommend!<//text>

Had an amazing experience at public storage. I was helped by Mike who was very friendly and helpful. Gave me all the Resources I needed to be able to pack and store my belongings. This was most definitely a memorable experience. He put my mind at ease by showing me the high-tech security system and I'm so glad this is my public storage location. I get awesome customer service and a perfect place to store my stuff.</text>

Andrew, is absolutely AMAZING!  I cannot begin to convey how patient, kind, thoughtful, caring, and professional Andrew was at a difficult time!  My husband and I had some difficulty with our storage unit and Andrew was the hero of the hour!  He made us feel very reassured and comfortable, all the while doing everything he could for us.  I feel so blessed that he was there to help when we truly needed him.  Andrew, thank you for being wonderful!</review>

< Review>
I have been using this facility for several years. The staff has always been very nice and easy to work with. Elissa helped me with my current unit (I've had 3 so far) and she did a great job. The facility is all above ground and the main building is three levels high. You can have outside or inside units. The inside ones in the main building are air conditioned, and my unit on the 1st floor runs about 75 F. I used to have a 3rd floor unit and it was hotter - around 85 F, so try to get a 1st or 2nd floor unit if that matters to you.

When I first started renting, the prices were reasonable and comparable to other locations in the area. I started out with a small 10 x 10 unit until I needed more room, then moved to a 10 x 19. That was fine until the rent increases started. My rent went from $227 to $294 in about 18 months. There were no extra services, the air conditioning wasn't any better, they just raised the rent. I understand the District manager has changed and apparently likes to raise rents. In response, I downsized to a 10 x 15 for under $190. I hope the rent stays down, otherwise I will have either downsize again or move out.

For the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the location, I am giving 4 stars, but not 5 because of the rent increases.<//Review>

I just want to say that moving is a very stressful event.  Mike from this facility made this a little less stressful.  He was working alone the day I went in to rent a unit.  The computer system kept going down,  there were customers in there closing out their unit, others wanting to rent units and other customers that needed to pay.  Mike kept things under control and managed to get me the best price and unit for my needs.  Thank you Mike for going above and beyond.  Your kind knowledgable assistance was greatly appreciated.  Everyone at this facility is very friendly and ready to assist.</Text>

<review>Public storage is the best quality storage option in the La Mirada area. It is clean and secure, along with being convenient. Especially good for students, as it is right down the street from the university. My only complaint would be the price is a little on the high side, but the quality and security offered by this facility is by far worth it.< /review>< rate>

<text>I've had a storage here for ten years. Super clean, convenient. I recently split my unit into two smaller units. Mike helped me get two units side by side, which is no small feat. He made the process go smoothly and was very helpful.

If you need a storage I recommend this location.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>We were helped by Lisa at the front desk. She was extremely nice and helpful and we enjoyed working with her. She helped us find the right size storage place for us, and we were really impressed with her kindness.

Highly suggest going and talking to her and using their storage places. We have stored there for two years now and they are clean and well taken care of.</Text>< UserId.>

I set up a unit online and the next day the manager called to confirm everything.  When I showed up with my movers, Tiana was really helpful and accommodating.  My family has had storage units in this Public Storage on and off for years.  It's definitely a good one.  Very safe and quiet and the staff is extremely nice.<//Review>

My brother and sister in-law needed a place to put thier things since they were moving from one house to the other. I gotta say wow! Akamie made everything easy for them and answered every question we all had. She even let us know we can use the dollies they had there to help with moving my brothers things. I recomend this public storage to any one who needs storage.</text>

I was needing to inquire about a storage space and i choose to go to this location because it was not far from me. As i walked into this location lisa was the girl at the counter, after going through what i was storing she referred me to a 10x10 i believe it was but the pricing was to much for me. she went out of her way go check other propeties for me but i liked this facility and the location. i asked her when the prices drop to please give me a call because i do need to rent within this next month. Her caring and warm welcoming is the reason i want to store here in the future and i hope i get her when i go in to get a storage. Great customer service, its unfortunate of these ridculous prices from the company though.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This is not my first time using Public Storage, nor will it be the last. I rented a storage unit here a couple of months ago, I'm still here and I'm still happy. The La Mirada facility is always clean, I feel safe, and has great customer service. There is always someone there to help me with anything I need help with. I was just at the facility on 10/31/2013 to pay my November rent. There was a young woman working there by the name of Tiana. I was a little worried I was going to get the typical young person negative attitude and disregard for everything life has to offer. I was completely shocked with how positive and professional she was. I wanted my account switched to automatic payment. She not only remedied all my account issues, she answered all of my questions as well. It's not very often that I walk into a place to pay a bill, and leave in a better mood than before I came. I would like to personally thank Tiana for all her help and insight. With employees like that your business should never fail.</review>< pics>

Don't pay these disreputable people a penny more than you actually owe them -- they won't give you a refund. We paid our monthly bill in advance each month, as they required. We gave notice in September and moved out of our storage unit on the 6th of the month, but they refused to prorate and refund us the unused portion of the month. I read the contract fine print -- there is nothing about refunds one way or the other. But these unethical people have decided to keep people's money instead of doing the right thing. I called Bryan Yatabe, the district manager, twice to discuss this, and he didn't have the courtesy to return my calls. Bad business practices -- buyer beware.<//review>

This is second time I'm using this storage.  It is very clean and has air conditioned unit through out the building.  Most of all Lisa and Tiana is very helful and friendly.  I shopped the other public storage near the area and none of them is as clean and new as Public storage at La Mirada!!<//Review>

THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My wife's ex-husband had two 10x10 units rented at this location. He passed away and my wife was going through them before they locked us out on the 10th of january 2015. The management then noticed my wife on the 9th of jan. organizing the property in the 2 units with the intent of having them emptied by the end of day  january tenth 2015. When the management confronted my wife she told them that her ex-husband had passed away they told her to stop whatever she was doing and escorted her off the property, changed our gate code so that we no longer had access to our personal things.. ...instead of being civil about our loss they locked her out and are holding an auction sometime tomorrow march 6 2015 the are attempting to sell them at auction. does anyone know with whom they contract to auction of their delinquent units?</text>

< Review>
The worst don’t use auto pay , when you close unit and they confirm auto pay is turned off and you owe nothing a few days later they will Charge you another full month that you don’t want and refuse to refund.  So if you want to pay more than you should go here very unfair company.  I’m am never using this business again.  They must be desperate having to rip off customers</Review>

<Review>Tiny spot that is hard to find in an unassuming location. The selection isn't large, however, this place is METAL. I think given where it is (Downey) makes it even more metal than metal. Cool spot that is dimly lit and blasting tunes. I was hoping they had goat heads on  spikes but I guess I was asking for too much.<//Review>< Pics>

The store's smaller than I expected and the parking minimal,  but the atmosphere bleeds METAL!  There selection of clothing and music items are really well curated,  you can tell this shop is operated by experts in the underground metal genre.  Highly recommended for any purveyor of Metal,  can't praise them enough.<//Text>

<text>Good selection of well-known and obscure metal on vinyl, CD, and a small cassette tape section. I found Decline of Western Civilization: The Metal Years on DVD and a Halloween movie shirt, items I've been searching around online for but wasn't willing to pay for the prices I saw for them. Bay is a knowledgeable and helpful guy and we talked a bit about the old days of our well spent youth seeing metal and punk bands. This place is a must stop for any metal fan.<//text><username>Chris Harjo<//username>< gmapID>

<text>Friendly staff and great idea, but damn: where's all the selection? Were there even two dozen records in the entire place? Adequate CD inventory for the Metal section of a theoretical other store that covers multiple genres, but if that's your one & only, I think you need to offer more. But hey, probably the best patch selection I've seen in a while.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Nice workers and great music, regularly updated stock. I didn't find the exact band I was looking for but that's okay because I found many others. I'm definitely going to be a regular customer.</Text>

A destination during my vacation. They have and good amount of CDs, some vinyl, and plenty of great merchandise.They have some cassette tapes. Most of the stuff that they have is extremely obscure which is great because you don't have to go through CDs that you already have. I got some CDs and shirts. They didn't have a shirt that I wanted right then, but within the next hour the dude made it happen and I had my shirt before I left. Superior customer service, personable and professional staff.< /review>

I take my 95 eg hatch to get serviced there as well as all my friends who have imports for mods as well as regular tune ups performed. The cost is right here and well under for the amount of care they put into their work. Great job Rspec!<//text>

<Review>I cannot express enough how much I love this store!! If I could give it more stars I would. We have been going here for the last four years and plan on coming for at least the next 4. These ladies are incredibly nice, helpful and have weathered covid so well adapting to the new rules. From baby furniture, clothing, toys, bottles and diapers to my toddler’s toys, clothing and books. I wish I would have known about this store when I pregnant - their maternity clothes, strollers, nursery prep and even newborn baby gifts both brand new and used have been appreciated by all recipients.

When my kids outgrow things we trade them in and buy the next sizes up. I wish there was a teen and adult version of this store! Thank you ladies!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I'll be back! The store was more than I expected, I was only looking for nursing tops. I had to come from Antioch since there aren't any maternity stores anymore in my area. The ladies who run it are very nice and helpful. Thank you! :)<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPft0oOVLzRbRJLsLLJNOsVWEA3tMYz1nwU7D5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Love love love this place. The owners are angels. I consign here, buy online, and buy in store. Their second hand clothes have plenty of wear left in them. Stroller city. Buy things second hand! It's SO much more affordable and is environmentally friendly. Tell all of your friends!!!!<//Text>

<Text>I love this place! Been coming since I was pregnant now my daughter is 2.5. They are so helpful and have a large selection of very reasonably priced items. I live in sf and try to make it out every couple months. Its way better than second hand children's stores in sf. Its clean and organized. Selling items are also very easy.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Wow is all I can say!  I brought my 7 year old bug a boo (for baby number 3) to stroller spa and they made it look absolutely brand new, roll smoothly and fold easily!  Thank you stroller spa!  And only $99!  What a deal. Jamie was a pleasure to meet and work with too!!<//review>

Wonderful, very complete offerings. The store is clean and bright - not dusty, hot, and dark like so many other children's consignment shops - and the owner is very nice too. I have never had a bad experience here.< /Review>

I've been to other consignment stores in Oakland/Berkeley area looking for baby clothing and was always disappointed in what they had (also some were still too expensive). I would say this is a great place with lots and lots and lots of great baby clothes for a great price!

(they have other stuff too, but I just went here for the clothes)</review>

Part of our mission is to help reduce the waste that comes with raising children so we sometimes do have items that are well loved but still have life in them but we try to price them accordingly. We try to price fairly and in line with market rates for used items. Ideally, we want to provide a good deal for both our buyers and sellers, as well as being able to cover our business expenses. I definitely welcome specific feedback and suggestions. If you stop by again I'd love to hear your thoughts. Naomi"}<//resp>

My auntie works here and she works so hard and gets no days off she wanted to work here and get her teachers degree. But she never has time to start that and she has no time to spend with me (11 year old girl). She works hard and all she wants is a day off. If your planning on working here rethink your decision. Thank you for reading!</review>

This office has some lazy carriers. They lie when they say a package cannot be delivered. My regular mail came today. But the small package that was supposed to be left at the door was not. The mail carrier was too lazy to get out of the truck and leave so they lied about the delivery and said that the driveway was blocked and they couldn't deliver the package. It was perfectly clear and I was home. I saw the carrier and waved and they drove off without leaving the package. Even though they saw me walking out to get it! and now with all the cutbacks you can't get any customer service to even complain.<//text>

3 packages said delivered, 2 were delivered to the wrong door. Third one is as of now nonexistent, not been delivered or may have been delivered to the wrong parcel locker. The mail lady needs to get better at their job, having multiple packages delivered to the wrong parcel.</text>

Want to know about your package that has a status as delivered? Good luck... 6 or more people in line only 1 staff attending. Maybe this facility is under staffed?

Most post offices are good. But the staff here needs more training, in my opinion.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80db50fc6aee2171:0x23ae0a637ffb5232< /Gmap_id></record>

By far the most awful Post Office in the country.  I had a pkg that needed my signature. I waited all day. The tracking said they could not access my property? I called the next day and they could not find my item.  Somehow the destroyed box with an odd note written on it showed up in my mail box a day later. The tracking said nothing. Today, "weeks later" I got a tracking update saying my item was being mailed back to sender.  Ummm - what item is that since I received mine in a suspicious way.  I went in to the Yucaipa branch. Asked for a manager. Showed them the mess and I was kicked out.  Lovely, and they wonder why the Postal service is going out of business.
Oh, and I did figure out what was going on. It's extremely disappointing. They should be ashamed.<//Text>

There have been multiple times that I have been waiting for an important letter/package only to have a note in my mailbox saying that they attempted delivery and no one was home.  Happened again today, and like other times, there were people home and no USPS employee came to the door. All the carrier does is put the note in the mailbox without coming to the door, then I have to go to the Post Office on the next day that they are open. When I try to call the Post Office, the phone rings until someone picks it up and immediately hangs up the phone without speaking.<//Review>

<time>1495579195358<//time><rating>1</rating><text>I'm SOL. Carrier delivered to wrong address. There's nothing I can do about it. Won't release address where package got delivered. Since I didn't have insurance, I can't be reimbursed. I purchased through eBay so I didn't have a choice. But I didn't know I needed insurance to protect against a carrier doing the ONE THING THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO - deliver to the address on the box.

Go FedEx or UPS and put these guys out of business.... what a joke.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< review>
Of all the places I have lived in these United States, Yucaipa has consistently delivered the worst postal service I have ever experienced. The counter is always short staffed, especially during peak times. There have been way too many issues to list here, but I will say this: Every issue I have brought to the attention of every postmaster on duty at this post office has been flippantly dismissed without any attempt at a resolution. There have been three incidents (so far) that were so egregious that I have filed formal complaints.</review>

HORRIBLE.. The mail carriers constantly putting our mail into others boxes.. Some neighbors are good about re-delivering to us.. Some are not.. MULTIPLE packages have gone miss delivered! Over 6 months worth of horrible delivery!! You call the post office, and they always say someone will look into this problem and call back.. NEVER have I got a call back!!< /review>

Our mail delivery service also constantly mixes up our mail with other neighbors on our block and sometimes the block below us for the last 13 years. Good thing our neighbors all get along and return our mail to us and vice versa.<//Review>

<text>tired of the bull and new temp. carriers with attitudes. I am listed as disabled and my mail need to be delivered on my porch, as I can't go to the street box. The new asian man carrier is extremely rude and has a personal problem with getting out of his truck and picking up and delivering the mail on my porch, so he will purposely skip my house, even if I am waiving at him that I have a pick up. He'll look straight at me, and drive away. I have a feeling it's time to contact the ADA. I've never had issues with anyone else except him. Three of our neighbors have officially placed complains about him, and he continues to get away with it. This is definitely a discrimination problem, and I have tried calling our local post office with no luck.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80db50fc6aee2171:0x23ae0a637ffb5232< /Gmap_id></record>

My Mom has fallen and can't walk across the street so her Doctor wrote a letter to have post box moved to are side of thr street everyone on are sides box is on our side.  Did not get ok and again she fell and broke the other hip ,  This time letter from MD to have it next to door, we moved it put it at the 5 foot high they wanted now instead of coming up to the post box they are putting mail in the bright orange Sun box says Sun on box in black and Orange. Come on can' t they read.  Each time we call they say they will talk to person that delivers so far this week has been in sun box twice and it's only Thursday.< /Text>

<Text>The government sucks at everything, especially the postal service. A recurring problem is when I need to sign forsomething, instead of checking if I'm home the courier just leaves the letter in the mailbox. Seriously  the government is just wasting our tax dollars with this garbage.</Text>< Rate>

Avoid this place if you can. Pay the extra for UPS if possible. My products were destroyed by USPS and the supervisor/manager was super rude insisted its not his problem and there's nothing he can do. Terrible business with terrible people working here.</Text>

Tracking said package was out for delivery and mailman failed to deliver a package with the mail. Then later after the post office closed tracking said it was ready to be picked up locally. Went the next day for them to tell me they can't find it. Why do these people keep their jobs?</Text>

The place is really small and cute!
There is indoor and outdoor dining available.
We ordered two chicken dolce paninis and two matcha green tea lattes (substituted the milk for oat milk).
I didn't catch the name of the person working the counter but they were nice and constantly checked on us.
I plan on returning soon! 😊<//text><date>1620677831900< /date><resp>None< /resp><username>Daney Gonzalez< /username>< pics>

<review>The Green House Cafe is a cozy spot for breakfast and brunch/lunch. The food here is amazing, and the service is quick and friendly. Our server stopped to chat with us, and made us feel very welcome. The decor within the restaurant is very cheerful and the restaurant as a whole is well maintained and kept clean. Prices are reasonable, and the food seems to be that of an American diner, but with an awesome flair. I highly recommend.<//review>< username>

<text>I've come here several times so I should probably finally review it since it obviously keeps me coming back for more. I've had lunch here a lot but this was my first time trying it for breakfast. Unfortunately for me it was so good my wallet will be very unhappy because I might come back here for breakfast everyday.
I got the Korean Pork Breakfast Burrito and it was incredible. I love breakfast burritos, and I love Korean BBQ, but I never considered combining them before. I'm so glad this place did that because the spicy pork with egg and mozzarella wrapped up in a tortilla was mouth watering. I ate it very slowly to savor and each bite was better than the last as I dread the final bite which meant the end of my delicious journey. I can't wait to go back and get it again!<//text>< rating>

<review>Greenhouse Cafe is a family owned restaurant. They offer a great breakfast and lunch menu. Also check out their specials as you walk in, I've had the Cuban Sandwich and the pulled pork Sandwich. They are delicious, also recommend getting the broccoli salad. It's amazing! The owner is extremely friendly, which makes you feel right at home. Oh try their smoothies, they are bomb!</review><Gmap_id>0x80dd2a13faa6286d:0xb56f5f853ba47c6f<//Gmap_id>< rate>

I really like the ambience, all painted green with a bonsai tree and not too crowded for a Saturday breakfast. 5 stars for a cute place for breakfast. There was one male server who also seemed to be a cook as he was gone for long periods. Despite not being around much he seemed like a nice guy and have the guest a lot of space. 4 stars for service. The omelette was good but didn't have a southwest type omelette which is my favorite. The waffle plate was pretty average. 4 stars for food.<//text>

Good food.  Mostly lunch items.  The restaurant is a converted home, so it's pretty small.  One room is for larger groups (8+).  Staff were cordial and efficient.< /review>

<Review>I drove by this place a few times when I was on my way to the Barnes & Noble in Fullerton. I am all about trying out new restaurants. One day I decided to stop by on my way to Barnes and Noble and I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually pretty good. It's quaint and quiet spot. Perfect if you're a student and need a place to study without loud noises of coffee making and people chattering.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

We come here for the breakfast burritos, which are incredible! The ambiance is great, there's a really cute outdoor patio that is dog-friendly, and the owners are warm, wonderful people! The food is complex and delicious. This is the place to go to if you're looking for a quiet, non hectic place to have an excellent brunch.< /Text>

Wow!!! This place is freaking adorable and has the best ambiance. This feels like having, breakfast/lunch/dinner or whatever it maybe you are there for, at a very close relatives house, like that one aunt who can cook everything and anything. The food is delicious!!! This place is a must!!! If you are considering of trying it, just do it, you'll thank yourself later.< /Review>

This is a great restaurant, not Sure why they're not packed all the time! The service is friendly and though the menu is small, the food is delicious and complexed! The Lox & Waffles is amazing!!!! This place is ran by a couple and, often, it's just them working. So, this is not the place to come to if you're in a hurry.</Text>

<Text>If I could give this place ZERO STARS I would!!
The WORST customer service I have ever experienced. We left in a state of shock from one of the most aggressive dirty mouthed insulting staff I have ever experienced. Straight out of a Jerry Springer show!!!! I almost feel sorry for the extremely upsetting female worker who's mission is to bring down others into whatever terrible life she is going through.
DO NOT GO HERE!!! DON'T BE FOOLED!!! The reviews are false! In fact, pretty sure they were done by family or theirselves.<//Text><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd2a13faa6286d:0xb56f5f853ba47c6f< /gmapID>< time>

<Text>I rated 5 stars because of the way my car looked from the most recent visit which was about 30 minutes ago today. I was in a rush so I washed it and rinsed it really quick. I usually use the spot free rinse after so it dries itself as I drive. I though today would have water spots and it didn’t! I hate water spot on my car and it was none. Whatever they’ve done since a month ago to now has my car looking great for just 10 bucks!! My go to spot now.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I enjoyed the first I came here, so I’m back again. I was fortunate enough to meet an owner of the car cash. During my vacuum process, there was an issue with how the switch on the vacuum might have been in the wrong setting. He quickly fixed the problem, which I found amazing. Very active with the customer. It’s a strong vacuum. The car wash itself is also great. Very soapy and I got a great clean. He mentioned that there will be more improvements soon. I can’t wait to see them. I will be back again.<//Review></record>

I know it used to be 6 or 7 mins with single swipe and shut off when timer is done. Now the clock goes backwards. It doesnt stop until you press the button. They charge $1 per extra minutes. it's little tricky now.< /Review>< pics>

What a deal! I can wash my car in less than 4 minutes using their super easy equipment. They have an awesome high pressure water system and they definitely don't scrimp on the soap! As a female I'm always a little nervous about going to self-serve car washes but Cypress feels safe and is very well lit! Will definitely make this my go to car wash from now on. Thanks for the awesome tunes while I'm washing ;)<//Text>

Equipment always working, clean wash bays, & friendly new owners. I come here at least twice a week, great place for self car wash

1 - I love the brighter lights in the was bays
2 - I love the pink foam when using the foam brush (it smells awesome too!)
3 - aside from the few idiots that tagged on the walls, you’ve turned this place around.
Thanks for making a chick feel it’s safer to wash a car after the sun sets

Good job!</Review>

<Review>I hadn’t stopped by in a long time because the car wash was become rundown. However, i’m glad i stopped by today to wash my car, everything worked and looked new. I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, real standout dude who was constantly checking in with his customers you have to love that. Definitely will be coming back.</Review>< Pics>

Easy peezy! Great water pressure and being able to use the credit card instead of dealing with coins helps a lot. Vacuum was easy to use and has shampoo options( I’ll do that next time). So
much easier than washing it in my driveway and making a mess of things. Definitely recommend coming here.</Review>

One of the rarer self serve wash locations that takes cash, card and change. Spot free rinse is actually spot free and the soap isn’t diluted to the point it’s useless. Haven’t been to a better self serve car wash.< /Text>

Great lighting and I personally have  had no issues with any of the machines. My God did have an issue with one of the vacuums but she got a quick response and no hassles for a quick refund by the owner ( who is often at the car wash making sure everything is working properly).< /Text>

One of the new owners Josh happened to be there the day I routinely wash my car st Cypress Car Wash. I explained to him about the amount of money I have lost in the machines there and he was more than happy to reimburse me along with an extra token for 2 car washes plus a free air freshener!!
I have been going to this car wash for approximately 8 years now and will continue to do so.
The Cypress Car Wash will take on a whole new makeover soon so check it out..!!!<//review>

I decided to give this place a 2nd chance, what a difference  a few improvements can make.  They now take credit cards, all the equipment works and it's much cleaner.  I'll return more often now that it's running like a first class car wash.<//review>

A dependable and helpful pharmacy. All should use them, in my opinion. They provide excellent service and are fast to respond. They're all excellent pharmacists to collaborate with. They grinned as they cheerfully welcomed everyone. Thank you for going above and beyond to meet the expectations of your customers.<//text>

Thank you so much! I greatly love the service that I received from the staff working in this shop. He was very accommodating, nice, and helpful. Honestly, he was the one to help me find the best pet, and I loved it. Their shop was clean, comfortable, and pets were well-arranged. Eventually, I came to realize that I will come back from time to time here. Again, thank you for the service!<//Text>

<review>A week ago, I decided to buy two hamsters for my cousin. I was so glad that I found your shop with the help of my sister.

I went to your pet shop the Last Monday afternoon and I met Ella. I bought some goods for my pets and Ella was very helpful if ever I have any questions. I was so happy because your staff gave me some tips on how to take good care of my pets. Thank you so much to all of you, especially to Ella! Highly recommended pet shop!</text>

<text>I bought my puppy here for his grooming. I like how their groomer did the grooming of my puppy. She did a great job doing it. The pet shop was so cleaned and spacious as well. The staff was so friendly and accommodating as well. The owner was so courteous as well. I will bring my puppy here again.</text>< pictures>

One of the worst pet shops I have ever been to. Dozens of animals stuffed into disgustingly tiny tanks. No heaters or enrichment for any of the tropical birds. No air pumps, sumps, or any equipment for the fish tanks (which were all completely FULL of gigantic goldfish). The tanks were egredgiously overstocked and underfiltered. The reptiles had no heat source, many had no hides and were being cohabbed, which is a major NO for animals like leopard geckos, ball pythons, and others that were crammed together when I visited. There were around 10 red slider turtles left in a 3 foot long tank with less than an inch of water in it. There was only one dry area for them, all of the turtles were struggling to sit on the one dry rock under the (I'm hoping it was a heat lamp) heat lamp. No source of temperature control or filter in their tank either. The finches all had overgrown toenails and could hardly move in their cages. Around 6 rats were in each of the 3 tanks for them -these tanks couldn't have been more than 10 gallons each. ALL of the rats had scabs and bloody patches from fighting with one another. The "baby rats" cage (as it was labelled) was completely covered in newspaper, and one of the owners yelled at me when I tried to look inside.

There's signs saying "No pictures!!! No videos!!!" in every corner of the store. If the owners were really taking good care of the animals they have in stock, they wouldn't feel the need to hide what's inside their store. Not to mention, many of the animals have questionable origins. Some of the birds for sale are listed as illegal to own in the state of California, I'm doubtful as to if the owners know this. I'd say it's safe to assume so, unless they're so ashamed of their husbandry that they have to put signs up everywhere saying not to share pictures of their store.

I spent some time talking to and petting their Amazonian blue faced parrot through the cage she was in. When the lady (one of the owners) saw this, she ran over and yelled at me, claiming this bird bites. I'm not trying to call into question the treatment of these animals, but I've worked with very agressive birds before, and this animal nuzzled his face into my hand upon meeting me for the very first time. I really don't see a bird this friendly biting anyone without provocation.

After she yelled at me to stop, the lady ran around the corner of one of the aisles in the store and said something to her husband, who then came around the corner and followed me the rest of the time I was inside. Which wasn't very long, because as soon as I started to look through the goldfish tanks, he told me that the store was closing and that I needed to leave immediately. I asked why, since it was a few hours earlier than the listed closing time on their door. He just said, "No, you need to get out now."

I went across the street (where my bus stop was) and watched as they proceeded to... Not close the store. And let other customers in. For the full 30+ minutes I waited for the bus. Funny how they were so eager to close when I was looking around, but didn't seem to be in a rush once I was gone.

Needless to say, I will not be going back to their location for business. I will do my best to document what I saw and add the photos to my review.

If you've read this far and are looking for a good place to get fish, birds, and other animals, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Age of Aquariums in Long Beach, Reptile Factory in Long Beach and Garden Grove, Hong Kong Tropical Fish in Norwalk, Atlantic Tropical Fish in Norwalk (which sells various fish, birds, and some reptiles), and ESPECIALLY Tiki's Tropical Fish in Bellflower (which sells nearly every animal and all you'd need to care for them). These shops have exemplary quality animal care and stocking, and the owners are knowledgeable when it comes to the animals they sell and how to care for them. Please consider doing a little extra driving to support one of these businesses, they really do care about their line of work. I went into the Ramirez pet shop expecting the same, and left dismayed.< /Text>

The best and only place of it's kind in the entire San Francisco bay which is very surprising, but at least it exists. Friendly and pleasant, they are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Simply put, if you want and/or need a telescope, this is your only place! Thabk God they don't take advantage of that fact! The pricing is AMAZING!!!<//Text>

The assistant there was very helpful. Even though I told him I'm not going to buy immediately, he gave me pointers about astronomy meetings I should attend before deciding what I should buy. He even proposed a cheaper alternative to a telescope I thought would be my ideal choice. I highly recommend this place for any amateur astronomer looking to buy their first scope.</text>

Super friendly staff at this location. They're willing to geek with you, even if your knowledge is marginal. If you have NO CLUE what is the type of scope you're looking for - please listen to the folks working the floor. Patrick was especially helpful in helping me locate the type of telescope for my needs, educating me on on some beginner tips to improve my experience, and ensuring I wasn't engaging in many beginner's mistakes (you don't get this experience online, and it matters). You can tell these guys have a passion for the art and want others to get hooked too. Def plan on being a return customer!

Thanks ya'll!< /Text>

<Text>Very knowledgeable staff. This is my home away from home. Sadly I live in the North Bay but anytime I'm in the South Bay for work I stop in and get everything I need. It never feels like they are trying to sell me anything. They are just as happy to talk telescope and the stars as they are to help you find exactly what you need. Orion is great, and their own brand is top notch and reasonably priced.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fb5074b6a64fb:0x666b1410afc29436</GmapID></record>

<Text>Very lucky to have a brick and mortar telescope store nearby.

Their friendly staff and expertise helps make sense of what can be a bewildering hobby, and their excellent return policy is great insurance against the customer's stupidity.

When I first did business here it was to go through four relatively cheap telescopes in quick succession as I figured out what I really wanted - almost certainly costing Orion more than they profited.  They never once made me feel like the nuisance I certainly was.  This excellent experience has made me return time and time again.

If you are near enough to do your astronomy shopping in person instead of over the internet then I highly recommend visiting.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Last time I checked (has been a while), this was "the" telescope store in the Bay Area.  They carry good amateur telescopes (not the junk you see elsewhere) with a reasonable selection of name brands, though not so much high-end and specialty gear.  Staff is  knowledgeable.  If you are getting started and want good advice along with equipment that will actually work in a useful way, you owe yourself a trip here.

(I can't really speak to their service level, but G+ makes me pick something).< /review>

Great place to buy astronomy gadgets. Very helpful staff and offer great discounts or offers. I have got a telescope, books, eye pieces, binoculars and other accessories here.

Good place to start shopping for your astronomy hobby. They have an informative website with videos and also conduct free/paid events for public.<//Text>

Helpful staff who are more concerned about meeting your need than selling you something that won't do what you want.  Orion Telescopes has a very long history in the Bay Area, they're good folks interested in the long haul as well as long optics.  And their products are carefully selected by a staff who know what they're doing, I'd trust their house brand as much as the big name scopes (Celestron or Meade), and their bang for buck is superior.< /Review>

BEWARE - Orion will not sell you replacement parts for your telescope.  They expect you to purchase an entirely new telescope.  I have an XT10i and need a replacement base.  They will not SELL me a base.  To quote Debbie Woodward at Orion Telescope "we do not sell replacement parts – I appreciate that there is a market for selling parts and supporting used telescopes – over the years we have focused our business and efforts in selling and supporting complete telescopes and bringing new products and solutions to consumers"

We would love to sell you hundreds if not thousands of dollars in equipment, but why would you expect us to sell you replacement parts for it?<//text>

Outrageous shipping cost
I bought a copy of the Orion Deep Map 600, which is a great map. The map cost $12.99. Then they charged me $9.95 to ship it! The map weighs less than 2 oz and could be mailed for less than a dollar (70 cents!). I emailed Orion and complained.  Leanne V. from Orion Customer Service replied will several paragraphs of corporate boilerplate, and said, “Our philosophy is not to make a profit on shipping and handling charges”. But they made a profit of $9.25 on their shipping to me.</text>

We’re sorry that your experience with one of our store associates was less than ideal. Our official return policy is that if, for any reason, you are not completely satisfied with your purchase from us, you can return the item to us in new condition within 30 days of your original purchase.\n\nPlease give us a call at (408) 255-8770 during our store hours (Monday thru Saturday from 10:00AM – 5:30PM and Sunday from 10:00AM – 5:00PM) and ask for our store manager Ken so that he can offer further assistance, either with arranging for a return of the telescope under our official policy or by answering any questions that you may have about the telescope. It's very possible that Ken can help you solve the problems you are experiencing with blurry views.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOrion Telescopes & Binoculars"}</resp>< gmapID>

<text>Be careful, nice costumer attention before  but forget about any costumer support after, they only want and care to sell more and more pretending to be acknowledgeable to convince people that they have what you need. The seller were beyond rude and not able to guide me as he did before we bought a telescope. I set it up fairly easily, but concur that the knobs are cheap and not well made. Here is the problem I have with the telescope: It is very large taking up a good amount of floor space, but it does NOT perform well. We tested the performance against a pair of expensive binoculars and the binoculars performed better. This is basically a big tube with a mirror at one end and like all telescopes you see everything upside down. But do you really see the stars, the moon and the planets? Yes, but it's blurry and not what I expected for more than $1000 USD. After I called to explain I want to return it, the seller said that if I didn´t unpacked it all I had to do is to come back BUT if I already opened it I must talk with the manager on Monday because he isn´t able to tell me anything else and hanged me off...< /text>< pictures>

I have known of Orion products since starting astronomy in my teens back in Malaysia in the early 80's. Back then Orion shipped products and catalogs worldwide. They have always been known for their superb after sales service, and this tradition continues to this day. They also offer an extremely wide range of scopes to suit enthusiast of all levels. Since moving to Los Angeles in CA, I have made frequent trips up to both their display store and warehouse. They go out of their way to help you get the scope you want, even if it is not in stock (got my showroom StarBlast for a lower price cause they did not have it in stock when I visited way back in 2007 from Australia!). Now that I live in NorCal, I frequent their Cupertino showroom quite a bit, sometimes just to chat to their friendly and knowledgeable staff. I also personally have a couple of their scopes and accessories and can attest to their unflinching commitment to QC. Even though their prices are no longer the lowest, the fact that they stand by their product speaks volumns. Oh and they produce fantastic full color catalogs packed with all sorts of useful information. Highly recommended!<//text>

So I have almost been hesitant to give Serranos Barbershop a review because I wanted to keep this hidden gem to myself! Lol.  My boys and I have been coming here for about 2 months now and I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the quality haircuts and super friendly atmosphere that the owner Annai creates.  I was so tired going from shop to shop being disappointed from careless work and horrible language around my kids.  Serranos is the complete opposite, its so nice to always be greeted by a smiling face and knowing that you are going to get a quality cut.  And I have to honor the bravery that Annai had to make that decision and leave her comfort zone to start her own business, she truly deserves success.</review>

Delmi is the friendliest person that has ever cut my hair. She's also very professional and did an excellent job. This was my 2nd time there and it will be my go to place every time I'm in town. I live in Sacramento and I will be visiting every couple of months to see family and get a haircut. I usually only visit 2 or 3 times a year. But thanks to Serrano's and Delmi, my family will see more of me.😁< /review>

< review>
With the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak, the shop I've been going to every two weeks for the last six years went under.  Permanently closed.  I'm in Visalia from out of town this weekend and with a little research took a chance on this little shop around the corner from my Mother's house.  My hair really looks great.  I am very particular about my hair, and I am thoroughly satisfied with the result.  I would absolutely return if I'm in the area.  I would reccomend this shop to anyone.</review>

<text>Love it here. My kids are very picky with who cuts there hair and so far both barbers do a great job. 1 of my boys will only get his hair cut by Annai (not sure if I got that right) but she is amazing and gives her honest opinion as to what may look good. My son finally found someone who can line him up right.
Eddy i think is the Male barber and my son just got a fresh cut from him. I am so happy I found these 2.
By the way Annai also cuts girls hair and does an amazing job. My daughter was so happy with her cut and now my other daughter wants to start going to her instead of the salon. Great job and friendly, welcoming atmosphere.....<//text>< username>

<Text>Annai, will tell you to call her Annie because it's a bit tough to pronounce her name haha. But she is one of the best people to cut my hair before. I followed her from her previous place and got a hair cut and I feel born again.

She is really sweet and kind, she likes to smile and laugh so always expect for her chipper self.

Ok so down to business about the hair cut. I am
Super picky about who and how my hair is cut not a jerk but still lol. I like a high and tight fade almost military style haircut but a little more blending and a squared back but still taper all the back and sides so a 0 to taper.

She cleans it up nicely and I can't complain so whenever I am in town I try and stop to get a fade from my favorite barber. So go in and get ready to feel born again.

Oh and cash only</Text>< Pics>

Delicious, best in area. They accept debit/credit. Conchas are made throughout day since they sell quickly. Croissants are savory and sweet. They also have good carrot bread and bolillo. Basically every bread is good. Great prices. Don’t go or you’ll become an addict and have to talk yourself out of going every day like my husband and I have to do.< /review>

Great Mexican sweet bread, fresh and good variety but they run out of stuff occasionally and sometimes there is a line so be patient and try something new if they run out of your favorite.</text>

I'm going to say it THE BEST PAN DULCE I have ever had. Fresh, soft tasty. No wonder they sell out so fast.
The conchas (I prefer the mini conchas, but both regularand mini are delicious), the croissants, empanadas, cookies, just everything is great!
Be prepared to wait in line, it's that busy.
The ladies at the register are always sweet, no matter how busy this place is.<//text>

I've been to lots of panaderías.  This place has excellent breads.  Make sure you ask for some of the goodies behind the counter out of sight.  It doesn't all fit in the front.<//Review>

<Review>The 🍞 is fresh there's always a lot of people that it gets sold out soon that they have to put out more but what I see is that once they have a lot of clients they don't put their heart in the things they sell that happens every where you go. I like the bread better before they had a lot of customers< /Review>< user>

The bread is soft and warm. The price of a concha ain't too bad either $.50 and $.30 for the small.  Bolillos are $.40 each and plastic bags are $.25 each
Delicious bread!!<//review>

<Review>Lack of parking its messy , sadly lots of homeless  people by the entrance,  and outside of the front door its dirty , and smelly , otherwise  inside some good ladies attending  the place are very nice , the owner is never to be found or greet visitors the good ladies attending the place are overworked and underpaid God bless them , the owner sells Costco milk for over 5 dollars a gallon , while both gallons are the same price , what a thief<//Review>< Pictures>

Their pan dulce is ALWAYS fresh and good. I see a lot of people buying their coffee there. I love very strong coffee so I wasn't a fan of theirs. Their tamales are better than some of the other local places. Not great but good so I still buy them< /review>

< Review>
Arriving on a Saturday evening you get what's left....but what's left is delicious soft bread.  Bay Area needs to get a franchise out there.  I don't wonder why people r lined up n the parking lot.  It's worth the wait!  I'm going to try early morning .  It will be heaven😇 to taste bread warm from the oven.< /Review>

Great pan dulce and prices are amazing! 5 star!!

I give this place a 3 star rating only because of customer service... if you dont speak spanish fluently the ladies kind of give you attitude and dirty looks... Parking is terrible since its in a very small plaza....but other than that great place for a sweet Mexican treat!< /Text>

The pan dulce is fresh straight out of the oven!  People are encouraged to grab a tray and tongs and select the pan dulce of their choice and wow, there is quite a selection!  And what a line of faithful customers!!< /Review>

<review>Best sweet bread and bolillo!! Period. Expect to wait in line at peak hours, between 4 to 8pm. But its so worth it. The quality of the bread and bolillo is unbeatable. Definitely recommend Pan de agua🤤🥐< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Unfortunately I had the worse experience we just came and asked for 100 little conchas for my uncles funeral today the cashier was very rude i was in shock ! she said we dont have any! in a bad way, the Baker heard and he said I will have them in 1 hour I said thank you to the Baker but the rude cashier said I cant take the order you have to come in 1 hour and see if we have some left!! I told her it's not hard for her to take my money and when thet are done I will pick them up, she said no if they are some left you can buy them ! shock! I asked for the manager in charge and no one was in charge i asked for the owner's number she ignored me ! If you dont want to be treated like this DO NOT SHOP THERE no matter what my mother says the bread is good but not good enough to get abused by the cashier its 10:30am on Friday June 14 I hope the owner reads this and either train the staff to be respectful to his customers or loose customers like us.< /text>

<Review>Came here at 7am and was very disappointed that the bread was not stocked up.  There were no more conchas or much of anything.  I would think that you would have bread frsh and ready in the morning since thats when it gets busy.  Plus the bread they did have out looked old.  Won't be coming back here...will go back to my favorite El Gallo Bakery.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cfcca8197f69:0x3b57e489c6da9b90< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They're bread is FANTASTIC! One of my gavorite places in all of ELA. And I've had bread from alot of places in my 50 years+ living in the area. The bread is always fresh. I love the lil conchitas, the cup cakes, and the elotes, and they have the softest bolillos.<//Review>

Best pan dulce around, hands down!  Their elotes arr my favorite, I'd buy more but I try to leave some for others, lol.  My son loves the chocolate conchas as well.  Our family will continue to buy our pan from here for as long as they're open!<//text>

When it comes to pan dulce...mexican sweet bread, this is the only bakery in all of Montebello or surrounding area to have the best. I'm picky when it comes to pan dulce, not just anyone will due.</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The attention is the worst, those who attend only spend in the gossip, I went to buy a thread of Kings and only had medium and large and told me that the girls left in half an hour, I waited half an hour to be told which were medium, this was a mockery for those of us who were waiting, besides that the prices were a bit exaggerated, 36 the median and 50 the big

(Original)
La atención es de lo peor, las que atienden solo se la pasan en el chisme, fui a comprar una rosca de Reyes y solo tenían mediana y grande y me dijeron que las chicas salian en media hora, esperé la media hora para que me dijeran que eran medianas, esto fue una burla para los que estábamos esperando, además que los precios eran un poco exagerados, 36 la mediana y 50 la grande< /Review>
