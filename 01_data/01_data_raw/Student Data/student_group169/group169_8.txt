<Review>SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
Super disappointing and horrible customer service. Their sales assistant are there to get money on commission, they could care less about the car they’re giving you. We bought a car recently, used, and once they sold it to us they didn’t bother to fix the damages we were told would be fixed before getting it. Their workers are young, high on the job, and are unprofessional. Please go elsewhere, do not waste your time here, management is horrible.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1621299422760, 'text': 'Hi Alyssa, my name is Brandon in our Customer Service Department.

<name>sean Ilejay<//name><time>1614334285377< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>not even 5k miles later after buying my car, the cylinder head has gone bad, and i will need to rebuild the head. (~2500$)

when i asked to them to replace the tires upon delivery of the vehicle, they replaced two tires w no alignment- two rear tires lasted less than thousand miles.

when filling out the paperwork for the car, the employees here add so much ‘fluff’/unnecessary paperwork to obscure the buyer & prevent them from noticing any of their shady business:

example: my trade-in paperwork from oc auto exchange was a joke. ‘N/A’ was put under each blank for year make model and vin.

Steven Ramirez youre slick.

stay away from oc auto exchange.</Text>< Pics>

We were looking for a car for our teen daughters and have been researching options in our price range for months.  We were working with another dealer on the same vehicle and they gave us ridiculous pricing due to 'accessories' that weren't transparent.  After a failed deal, we worked with Miguel at OC Auto Exchange.  Within an hour, he had picked up the vehicle we needed from another location, offered to fix a dent on the front passenger door and kept the cost in our price range.  Miguel was efficient and provided excellent customer service.  It was a positive car buying experience and a great example to show our kids. Thank you so much!<//Text>

I came into the dealership with an already approved loan from my bank. They had a good selection of cars online and saw one I liked. I spoke with Eden and he made my buying experience extremely easy. We decided on a time that worked best for both of us in which I could come in and test drive the car. After test driving the car I knew it was for me. We talked pricing and got the paperwork signed. He got the car washed and fully detailed before I drove home with it. If you go here speak with Eden he’s straight forward and makes buying easy.</review>

<text>Horrible experience, bought the extended warranty, after one year the car needed service while in Texas, took it ti a Nissan dealership and oh surprise!!!!! O C auto exchange did not purchase the coverage but charged me more than $2000.00.
Calling back and forth, O C, warranty company, Nissan dealership and no coverage.
Warranty company said my car has never been covered, Nissan said the same.
Clearly O C was trying to keep the money hoping I would never need the coverage. They even wanted me to bring my car to them so they could look at it, of course I said no to that.
Finally they purchased the coverage today, 3 days short of one year from purchase date.
BE CAREFUL! Really shady business going on. I will be contacting The Better business Bureu.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Tbh I made a mistake by choice them. They really are super slow, and please my car agency was Iden Rodriguez. He likes to waste your time. He act like he's doing something but literally he just looking at the screen. Another thing whenever you go with him make sure you read the papers because these people can't thrust them. They will tell you one thing but whenever you are going to sings it says another thing</text>

I did the on line application, got a call from Peter. I told him what I could afford to pay monthly. I chose a 2015 kia optima.  He said okay but when I came today he  tried to shark me by trying to get me to  finance a $8,000 car for $16,000 for 6 years. That is highway robbery! I am a child of God and seen right through his BS. Peter had me under the impression that I was approved for the car already. I specifically asked him yesterday if I was good on the monthly payment and everything because I was bringing my kid with me.  My child was excited to get a car but left the dealership crying.

They false advertise what they put on the sites like autotrader, and cargurus which was the search engine I used. It states the vehicle I was looking at is covered with extended warranty when in fact it was not. Places like this should not advertise lies because there are others that look at it and are interested only to be told the same thing lies. What a waste of our time.< /review>< pics>

However,  in response,  a significant extra enhancement was added at no charge.   Conclusion: These guys know how to make things right.  A place where you get great value.  They work hard and go the extra mile to gsin your trust.</text>

After many "back and forth" emails asking for pricing and trying to make a deal I just sent this email to dealer - thanks Eric for whatever efforts you've put into this. I think I'm going to move onto a dealer that actually gets me information and wants to sell cars. The turnaround time for your company is so very poor. Not reliable at all. I wish you well. At this point I would not recommend your services. But that doesn't mean I don't wish you better luck.

They simply don't want to get the deal done, i suppose. I am unsure why there is such a lack of response. No phone calls. No email with promised information. No OTD pricing as requested several several times. I am a ready to buy customers and they just don't get back to me. Time to cut my loses and  move on from this dealer. Hope they can develop better service and a desire to actually serve the customer rather that just say they want to.<//Text>

Money > Customer Service
I was in the market for a vehicle for awhile and finally found a vehicle that I like and was in my price range. I contacted the dealership which was originally the LA Auto Exchange. I asked them for the out the door price which was $11,162.85 including state tax and DMV fees and I had other people confirm that amount. I told them that I could come in with a cashier's check the following week to purchase the vehicle in full. The days leading up to the appointment, I received numerous phone calls, texts and emails from different dealerships about the same car and started making appointments for me without asking what day and time works best for me so I started getting even more messages confirming my appointments that I never made. They were like vultures. One individual stated that they could bring the vehicle to a closer dealership and I agreed since the drive would've taken close to an hour and the closer location was about 15 minutes closer. The day of my appointment, I called the Fullerton location, OC Auto Exchange, and they said that the price of the vehicle out the door was over $11,500 and they said they had no idea who quoted me my number and I told them who. They refused to honor that number as I sat in the bank parking lot for close to an hour waiting to make the cashier's check. They then began haggling the price lower and lower and said that I HAVE to pay for their theft protection that they installed. The dealers stated that it was mandatory and I know that it's not legally required to purchase that and when I told the dealer that I knew then he dropped the price a little more. Then they gave me their "absolute lowest" price which was a few hundred dollars more than the original quote. I then called the other dealership and they said to cancel my appointment with OC Auto Exchange because they would honor the price. I called OC Auto back and then they said they would honor the price and they said they already sent someone to that location to pick up the vehicle for my appointment that was supposed to be at 10 a.m. I arrived at that time but the vehicle wasn't even there and it took about an hour for it to arrive. The salesman just kept saying it's on it's way. When the vehicle arrived, it had unmentioned defects such as the vehicle's engine thermostat broken off which they reattached but doesn't even move and cosmetic defects such as scratched plastic and vinyl tearing and the 12V cigarette charging ports weren't working. Plus the vehicle being about 700 miles over what it was being listed at. Regardless, I needed a car and felt as though the minor defects could be manageable. The salesman said that he had to get the vehicle taken in for the smog test and then washed and detailed and ot would take an hour or two. I had my brother who was my ride go back home since it's a long drive back and forth and I decided to wait. After a few hours of walking around the area, the salesman texted me that the car was back and that I had to fill out some more paperwork. I walked back, filled out a few forms and then he said it'll be about an hour for the vehicle to finish being cleaned. I went back out for about an hour, came back and waited at the dealership for about hour. I texted him and he said to come back to his desk to fill out more paperwork. Then they finally brought the vehicle out but it took him about 20 minutes to out air in the tire as I waited inside not knowing what was going on. Finally, everything was finished and I was so excited to leave but he came rushing back out with a giant red bow and wanted to waste more of my time for a picture. Then I drove off the lot and noticed that the gas light was on. The vehicle was completely on empty. I was just glad to get out of there because I was there at the dealership for about 7 hours. The salesman definitely could've been more honest about the wait times and more communicative as I just sat there waiting for him to say something to me as he just kept running back and forth and disappearing. This was a terrible experience.< /text>

Miguel was very helpful at first but became lazy after the deal was made and the cash was handed over. We asked they replace the missing floor mat and they gave me smaller cheapy Mats (99¢ store quality) that does not even cover the floor! When confronted, Miguel was "I can see if I can order the mats." If you paid $12,100 in cash for a vehicle, wouldn't you at least expect stock floor mat? Then after a very unsettling and unresolved conversation, backing out of the driveway into very unsafe traffic conditions, I accidentally scrapped my new car on a pole. Needless to say without much help from Miguel I drove off the lot in a damaged vehicle after they claimed they could do nothing for me.

Extremely stress that you do not shop for cars here. Would not go back

Everything was going well until I brought my car into the dealership. Big surprise they Sold me a car with bent frame. I read reviews about it people with the same issue they explained to me that the gram wasn’t bent at all and showed me a diagram saying everything was perfect. I called to get some help from them with this issue and they said since I bought my car 3 months ago they can’t help me... and that I probably bent the gram within the time after they sold it to be lmaoo. But all I do is commute to and from work and stay home because of Covid. :/ I wouldnt recommend to anyone anymore</text>

after seating with Cristian and discuss the price, we came to an agreement to proceed with purchasing the car (pay full in cash) we left at 12:30pm looking for a Bank before they close to withdraw the $$$. As all the banks had a long waiting line outside and we knew we were going to take a long time, I called Cristian and explain the situation... he said then that the price provided wasn’t good no more and the price went up, because whatever excuse or reason was that the owner didn’t approve the first deal after we were given the deal price by Christian and revised by manager who he went to ask every 5 mins..  you know how this things are played!
Well, I’m glad we didn’t do the long waiting line in the sun on the bank for nothing and I’m glad I called.
Resumed, no professional at all. Once you do a deal you maintain the deal no matter what, I don’t recommend this place but of course it is up to you, just letting you know our experience. I honestly will pay more to another honest dealer and a professional sales person. I don’t need a meet and greet sales person who his word is not worth anything.</Review>< Pictures>

Apparently  age plays a factor  in the seriousness of purchasing  a V8. Test drive in a Camaro SS was refused at the dealer, which resulted, needless to say, in a walkaway.
I ended up buying a brand new Camaro SS from a new car dealer. It's not that the customer service is bad, it's that for some reason they do not trust someone young with 455 hp at the foot print. Times have changed, but this dealership has not kept up.</Review>

<text>Recently bough a Mitsubishi Lancer, really enjoy it. I worked with Nathan, and I would say, if you go here, work with Nathan. He helped me every step of the way. He was upfront and honest, even helped me getting some cosmetic damage taken care of post sale. And made what could have been a stressful and hectic process very smooth.

<Review>I had left Chrysler Jeep Dodge in Huntington angry because they can’t comprehend the basics of auto financing and attempted to add 6k of random Add-Ons.

When I arrived at OC Auto Exchange Fahim Set me up at his desk and we went through everything.  We did a test drive and processed paperwork.  It took some time because I have a credit lock on my account (I am one of the thousands of veterans whose information was stolen plus some other issues with an ex).

When capitol one called the application process and we were good to go.

Fahim was transparent and honest throughout the process.  I highly recommend him as your salesperson.

I love my new car!<//Review>< pics>

Omg..don't do it..the car we were to see said no accidents on the Carfax BUT the front bumper was off the hinges and a big bump in the front. The interior was dirty and moldy, No effort to make it look nice..I don't know what's going on at this place..all the customers waiting inside looked upset and annoyed. WELL NOW I KNOW WHY...don't waste your time..we ended up going to Carmax and we got a car with a great salesperson..< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>PLEASE READ, I had been shopping around for my Q50  for about a month. I had visited multiple dealerships and websites. Still couldn't find anything in my budget.Came across the O.C auto exchange and happen to find the exact one I wanted with in my budget. I did read the reviews and was somewhat concerned, but than after comparing them to other dealerships it was all about the same, Including INFINITI dealers. My advice is to do your research on the vehicle. With that being said, I went in and was extremely satisfied on the courtesy and non-pressure salesman that were there. So PLEASE, ask for PABLO he was the salesman I dealt with direct. No haggling or hustling I let him know exactly what I can pay and what I had as far as a down payment. NO PROBLEM. He also met all my request as far as new tires on the vehicle, any minor scratches that needed to be painted and a new passenger mirror and put it all down in the contract. I was extremely satisfied. I will be taking my daughter in next month to purchase her first vehicle.</review><user>103243249099829390161< /user></record>

Harassed me to make an appointment to come test drive a car by texting me and sending me 8 emails. Made the appointment only for them to sell the car earlier in the day and failed to communicate that with me before I drove all the way down there. Real scummy move if you ask me. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.< /text>

<review>Ok I am going to begin with the positives then discuss some negatives about this dealership. First of all, My husband and I were shopping online for a 2016-2018 models. We found one but the car was destroyed when we got there in person. Justin was patient and helpful as we looked at other cars. They have pretty good inventory although yes they have been in slight collisions or have structural damage so look carefully at the car. They show you a car fax history report and Justin was upfront and honest about the car. We decided to get it. The negative, we waited several hours and yes he did try to tack on very expensive additional fees. We were going to walk away when he gave us lower price, but no warranty. We found that to be very strange. Evidently there is an odometer issue so it cannot be covered in warranty. It  took another 2 hours to finally drive car off lot. Justin was very professional and apologetic during the process.<//review><UserId.>101547519703454537656<//UserId.><username>Luann Harris< /username><GmapID>0x80dd2a1c2963919f:0x86858236f56ea335< /GmapID><rating>3</rating><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

THE worst customer service I have experienced in a car dealer. No one acknowledged I was there, no one said, “we’ll be right with you” or anything at all. I stood there standing for a good 20 min. Walked around the car lot to see if I find what I’m looking for, no one approached me. Horrible service! I just left and went straight Corona Motors Direct where they really helped me and gave me the best customer service ever!! These sales people really love their job. left home in a new Mercedes Cls 550. I truly do not recommend OC AuTo ExCHange!<//text>

Wanted to buy a Mercedes S class, was told that it was available, set up a test drive same day , drove an hour to get there. When I arrived place was like a zoo, asked 4 different sales people for help, each one said they will be right with me waited 45 minutes no one came out to help no one cared. I looked all over their lot , could not find the car i called about . Very disappointed , very upset   , have to drive back Home in traffic for another 2 hours. The worst customer ever . Deserve a zero for lying to me .</text>

Here’s my experience. Returning as a customer in which I purchased a car 4.5 years ago and was looking to trade in. Christian, then a sales rep who sold me the car, has now been promoted to manager. Decided to give them business again. This time around it didn’t go well. Miles was helpful with having me send documents in for trade in. However I did. Not get a call back the next with an appraisal. I called to learn he had the day off. I felt that should had been communicated beforehand. I decided to stop in that next day and Ivan took over the sales process. The Chrysler 300 I wanted that they had on the website was not on the lot. It was sitting at their mechanic waiting to be fixed while it’s being advertised. Couldn’t see the car however we did credit info to see if the deal would be possible. I was approved no money down and they would pay my old loan off and told to wait like a couple days for them to fix the Chrysler. Ivan had a set date and time and told me the car would be detailed and ready. I showed up and the car was sitting in the back not even detailed. I had to waste 2.5 hrs of my time waiting for them to get around to it. Once they rolled the car out I was disappointed. It had running glue like streak covering the entire passenger front door. Cracked windshield and body damage. Side note all their cars had body or frame damage at one point. I was disappointed yet again as I had wasted all that time and was told the car would be ready and yet again it wasn’t ready. Why would they think that would be acceptable. I left and had them fix said repairs requiring me to return in two more days. Third attempt to buy a car and I asked them to communicate to me when it’s completely ready. I had to keep calling to find out if it was ready. Eventually I picked up my car everything was fixed and I asked them to fill the gas tank for wasting my time twice. Ivan confirmed it would be filled. Guess what, it wasn’t filled and I wasted more time having to follow him to a gas station to then fill my tank. How hard was it to verify these things!? The final straw for this one star review is due to payoff of my loan. They lied. They told me I was approved by cap one with a certain interest rate come to find out after a month it was then approved by Well Fargo and I had a different interest rate. Although it was lower why can’t they communicate these changes to me? 3 weeks pass and I’m calling to see if they sent the check out and was told by Ivan that accounts payable sends them out within 7-10 days. Calling my lender to see if they received the check and nothing. They finally give me a tracking number of a piece of mail sent to what would be the wrong address. So now approaching a month post sale and I relate the news to them to send it to the correct address. How as a dealer would they not know where to send a payoff check? They told me they sent another check out and I requested to have the manager call me with the tracking when they send it out. The tracking they provided had a date of being sent out 2 days before I called about a wrong address to the correct address. I was hit with a late fee on my loan due to their non communicating and forgetfulness. I would not recommend people doing business with them and I would not return to this location as you will receive poor service and nobody ever said sorry for wasting my time over and over again. Read the other reviews as do what’s best for you. My car is now making a ticking noise but with the warranty I will have that checked out. Not happy with my entire sale experience.<//review>

<response>None< /response><Text>Purchased a car from here recently, the whole prcess was going perfectly, and the salesman was transparent until the dreaded moment of signing.

Pros: Quick customer service, noticeable patience, test driving without appointments, somewhat-knowledgeable "number talk" estimates, Detail work and aesthetic fixes done to my new car, most recent reports offerre, 80% KBB value dealer buy-back guarantee.

Neutral: Conflicting credit score determination. In my case, my credit score on my expedian-supported bank app was significantly higher than the one they were reporting during signing. They claim it to be due to "in depth credit history", however I still believe their info given to me was still false and for their benefit.

Cons: longer than expected to get my hands on my "new" car with constant miscommunication on accurate handling times, car had issues les than a month post-sale and they refused to give assistance (classic case of "you bought it, not our problem anymore!") the majority of the time I would have to remind them that I am still waiting for the damn car, a MANDATORY $750 dollar upcharge for an unnecessary "security" service that offers little-to-no consolation in the event of grand theft auto, fees that the dealer should be in charge of are passed down to the buyer, even though I called them out on it (in my case: Smog check $50, "document processing" (which is basically carfax and paperwork) ~$75), a thorough walkthrough and inspection of the vehicle was not offerred, very stubborn and reluctant with price, credit, and doc terms negotiations. They don't even give your damn car a full tank of gas. I barely managed to drive mines down to the next fillup station. Tires seemed to have been in mid-wear condition. Some stock features/parts of the vehicle were missing (in my case a tire lug nut, and a trunk safety item net.)

The majority of the cons listed above took place during the moment of signing. Aka, at the very last minute!

The only reason I give a 2 star rating is because they offered customer service relatively quickly, fixed up the interior upholstery, touched up the headlights a bit, buffed out some tire rim damage and claimed to have touched up some paint blemishes (but even then I am still finding some paint chips, paint scratches, etc. that need more working on.)<//Text>< gmapID>

I had been shopping for a specific car for quite a while, and I found one that I wanted to look at here. Miguel took care of me and worked hard to put me in the car, it had a few very small issues but they were kind enough to let me take the car that day after we had finished paperwork. I brought the car back roughly a month later for the work to get done and they really went the extra mile. They fixed everything I had asked for AND more. Highly recommend this dealership and Miguel if you’re looking to purchase a vehicle.</text>

Their advertised price doesn't include over $1500 in extra "fees".  Only after I walked out did the manager want to try to "make a deal" they had some nice cars, but I think there more interested in getting your money than giving you a deal. I liked Pablo, the guy I was working with, but his manager was holding out on making the deal I wanted until after I was gone. Their loss.</Review>

<Review>Salesman Ivan led me on all day, saying multiple times that they’d get back to me in 10 minutes, which ended up being 6 hours. He also had me test drive a more expensive model of the specific car I requested without telling me. Very manipulative. Then when I asked to work with a different salesman I was told that customers “fall through the cracks sometimes.” Sorry I wasn’t one of the more important customers. CarMax treated me like I was a priority.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Sold us a car and told us we would be able to bring it back if there were any issues. The car isn't a bad car, but Of course there were issues. Somewhat serious issues. Expensive issues.  None of them have been able to be fixed by oc auto. The guy who serviced us, ROY, was polite initially of course to sell is the vehicle, but since then has never able to be reached, always "busy" the other workers and salesmen there have absolutely no idea what's going on between each other and the mechanics have no idea what they are doing...first time we came for a service nobody even addressed us as we came in. Sat for five minutes then I decided to ask someone for help. Of course Roy wasn't there. They "fixed our car" (not really) then we had to come back another time months later for the same issue. last time we went to get a "service" they left oil all over our car under the hood, didn't fix the leak they were looking for and ultimately just told us that everything was fine and they couldn't find an issue with the car. We took it to another shop to find the mess they had left us. Unfortunately even though we like our vehicle (which doesn't really have anything to do with oc auto, they didn't make the car) we can't recommend this place as a place with good customer service. Stay far away trust me.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I purchased a vehicle from them and it was stated in the contract that they would repair the items that were damaged, it took 3 months before they did the work, the salesman kept giving me excuses, and when they finally ordered the parts they kept the car 8 days, I missed 4 days of work, and when they said it was ready and they just needed to wash it, it was filthy when I picked it up<//Review>

< review>
I live outside of California. Been shopping for cars online.  Found one I like on AutoTrader.  Call up OC Auth Exchange.  Their sales guy sales he'll call me back.  Never does.  I call again.  I'm told I can't buy the car unless I'm physically there. I want to pay cash. We can do all of the paperwork through fax.  I can verify any info they need. There is no reason I shouldn't be able to buy the car and have it shipped.  I'm told they won't do that because of "company policy."  I'm never given a valid reason.  I'm flabbergasted at the idiocy of it all. The manager calls me small-minded.

When someone says "company policy," it really means they can't or won't find a way.  They're lazy or incompetent or both.< /review>

They advertise low prices online and then when you get there, they add $995 Dealer Fee and a $982 fee for a pre-registered service that you cannot waive.

I spoke with multiple people saying the car was detailed and ready so I drove 2 hours to see the car, it was very dirty and obviously had not been washed nor cleaned.

<Review>Went to check out a car that had nice aftermarket wheels on it but when I drove an hour and a half to see it. They put rashed stock wheels on the car with flat tires. Car was dirty too when they said they had just washed it. Wouldn't recommend.</Review>< response>

<Text>No prices on the cars, Booo! Actually watched an employee repeatedly back into another car while he was moving a vehicle out of the lot. This is a high pressure car lot that tries to sell you on a payment rather than a purchase price, should be illegal.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Where do I start? Worst customer service experience of our lives hands down, not to mention they are DISHONEST. If you google this place you will see Better Business reports, and lawsuits against the company.

Initially when we called about the vehicle we were interested in I specifically asked whoever answered the phone if there was any STRUCTURAL damage to the vehicle (as we had just visited another one of their dealerships in Fontana for the same vehicle and it had structural damage… hmm starting to see a trend?!!). I was told that there was but it was only to the bumper and was purely cosmetic.

So we get there, and had to sit and wait for god knows how long for the salesman to move all the cars around to get ours out. We should have left at this point (big regret) The car HAD NOT BEEN DETAILED. There was literally melted ice cream or something in the cupholder, and food wrappers (REALLY?) Nobody seemed concerned about this in the slightest and if we didn’t have an issue with it would have happily let us drive off the lot with it like that.

We were literally at this establishment for 6.5 hours!!!!! 5.5 to 6 of these hours was the salesmen and the “manager” doing god knows what behind the giant one way mirror. Again we were told the structural damage was purely cosmetic (just the back bumper). We should have walked away from this awful place, but at this point its like you’ve spend SO much time there you don’t want to leave empty handed.

The car (which is a luxury vehicle, only a few years old) smelled and needed cleaned. We were so upset about this experience we weren’t even excited about the vehicle. We were also upset about how dirty it was and that it needed detailed, which can be costly.

So we called the dealership hoping to speak with a manager and maybe they would chip in or offer to pay to get the car detailed. You don’t spend 20+ GRAND to leave with a dirty car… Well RANDY, was awful. He told us we could drive back to the dealership (2.5 hours from us) to get it detailed.. or we could “simly do it ourselves” and then he said it costs what $30? And “If we are calling over 30 dollars…” (it cost us $120 our of own pocket to get it detailed) I’ve never experienced such awful customer service in my life. We called to give them a chance to make it right before we wrote a review and he told us we were threatening and to go ahead and write it… He also kept saying he didn’t understand why we had such a bad experience and tried to blame it on us why we were there so long (Ok Randy, that WASN’T the case at all) And threatened to hangup on us because I was "interrupting him". We were calling hoping they would do the right thing! and were treated like absolute dirt.

Also we had to pay out of pocket for an oil change, air filters, and the one tire was missing lug nut.

Honestly the whole experience was the worst thing ever, this place is J O K E. We were going to find out who the owner was and write a letter but after doing some googling you find out he’s worthless too.

I hope this review can help someone avoid this place, and have a better experience elsewhere!!!<//review></record>

Just like all the other reviews stated, shady business, hidden fees, typical used car salesman techniques. I should have researched them before driving from San Diego to find a very specific truck for my business. I rarely post reviews but please either take your business somewhere else or get a carfax, and an out the door pricing before you spend your time driving to their lot.

I think if you are looking for a luxury car with less than 80k miles for around $12k this is the place to go! I bought a beautiful car here with only 56k miles for $12k!! Steve is a wonderful salesman - does not harass you to buy a car. The prices are so low already that there really is no reason that you would feel you need a lower price.

I would recommend this place to ANY of my family and friends and with CERTAINLY be buying my next car from here.</Review>

<review>Talk about sleezy salesmen. David wasn't knowledgeable at all about the car I was interested in and failed to tell me the car I had bought was missing two bars from the battery life. Something that anyone selling should be honest about. He also didn't know that I needed a membership to charging station companies and said charging was free at the charging stations. Which is true very rarely, you have to pay to charge. It's very sad that people like him are out there selling cars and don't care about the customers .</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>1<//Rate><username>Angie Hernandez<//username>< gmap_id>

This place has the best Sales Rep ever! Find Adam. He definitely has the best knowledge and expertise to sell you an Audi.

OMG, best test drive experience ever. He's also very friendly.

Dealership is clean and organized (as expected). Lots of cars to choose from. But if you want specific design with options, you may need to verify availability in advance

Awesome place to visit.< /text>

<Review>I bought a car here in 2014, never made a review. To keep it simple, they buy cars that have been in accidents (still under clean title), and find the cheapest way to make it look as if it never was in an accident from the outside. I was getting my car completely re-painted and the body shop notified me if I knew my car had been in an accident. I argued and told them I've never been in an accident. Then and there I remember reading reviews of this place. Here I am adding to those reviews. They are all true. If it wasn't for the fact that I have plenty connections (body shops, mechanical shops etc) I would have taken extra measures and get a lawyer. Also my old trade in which the representative Isaac agreed had valued 1,500. I didn't notice til after, he valued it at 1,000. To whomever is planning on purchasing an auto from here. Another thing is like to add, when I bought my car my mother co-signed with me. Keep in mind the car was for me. The dealership told the insurance company the car was for her so she was only in the insurance policy, when I got my insurance card I called at complained to them. They said that was on the insurance company (believe the reviews, happy customers don't make this up) If you decide to ignore these reviews and still plan to make a purchase. Bring a trusted mechanic test and inspect the car closely. Speed and gas it in the car if you have too. Makes sure our investment is up to standard. Lastly, look closely to those "5 star reviews", it's they themselves with fake profiles. Exercise caution when purchasing here.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>They were trying to buy my rating, I had a problem with my car within the month and they didn’t want to fix the issue kept going around it, till they said they would cover me 100 bucks to help me with the costs of the car, and if only I can give a good rating. Well I didn’t take the money and didn’t give them the satisfaction of a fake rating. I had to change the battery and the control arms were in real bad shape and took it to there inspection place and tried to charge for something that wasn’t even the issue the struts. Never again. Be careful<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Poor customer service, management is rude. A "No Haggle" dealership is not a car dealership,  it's a car store, and it's a car store that rips you off. Don't be a sucker, do not shop here. It's a sled lot. The people that work there are dishonest punks.  Go to a branded, Real car DEALERSHIP with a trusted name. Like McCoy Mills Ford, or Hardin Honda. Those are car dealerships with great customer service, and reputation. This place is about as low as you can get. End of story.<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Name>

Bought my car here (2008 Nissan Xterra with low mileage) & within a few months literally everything went wrong. I just kept getting things fixed here & there but we couldn’t figure out what was wrong with it. Then about 6 months in, the engine finally blew. Once I got a new engine (cost more than half of what I paid for the car) then the problems stopped & it’s been a great car. But for what I paid in repairs I could have just gotten a new one. Do not buy a car from here.<//text>

The majority of their vehicles come from out of state. They buy wrecked cars from Arizona at the auction. They get the wrecked car for much cheaper than a car that has not been in a accident. Mind you the car is not a salvaged title but they buy it in it's wrecked condition getting it at a incredible price because other dealers would rather not have issues after  the sale. OC auto sales/Auto Exchange repair the car (using the absolute cheapest aftermarket parts and shoddy cut corners repair methods possible) then sell the car with an average $4,000 - $5,000 mark up. Now please know the story doesn't end here. They do they're best to steal the trade (give you $1,500 - $2,900 under your actual value) for you vehicle and that is 100% PROFIT. Now they get you to commit to the purchase using a payment...a payment where you are happy because the payment is all that matters at that very moment lets say ($347 per mo) and that dictates the finance rate 13.8% so you bought the car and drove off. Next they sell your financing (Selling paper) to a different bank for 6.9% and they pocket the difference in the financed money. Example the car cost with tax and licence $15.000 they give you (they're best rate based on your credit) 13.8% financing total amount of the car after being paid off $20,848.
In reality they sell your financing/car loan to another lender and they buy your contract (based on your FICO Score) for 6.9% the difference is the actual payment should have been $296 and the total of payments at the end of the contract $17,779 the net result is they ripped you off for $3,069. To summarize they make $3,800 - $5,400 in the actual price of the car...then steal your car for another $1,800 - $3,400 and after selling your contract another $3,069. Not a bad profit on selling one car to the right customer. WARNING THIS DEALERSHIP IS PART OF A DEALER GROUP OF SCAM ARTIST CAR DEALERS...((OC AUTO SALES)) ((AUTO EXCHANGE)) ((CALIFORNIA MOTORS DIRECT)) ((IE MOTORS DIRECT))

Please keep your eyes open as they will alter thee company name after it is burnt online..DON'T GET RAPED AND VIOLATED BY THESE SCUMBAGS!!< /Text>

From rereturn phone call to the test drive he signing of the contract, we really struck gold. Jessie was professional. Thorough and went in my opinion above and beyond. This dealership has my respect and will be always a point of referral for me and everyone & I know and next. Good works in the most beautiful & mysterious ways. I hope everyone here is blessed as they made us feel today!</Text>

I was having a terrible day and wasn't the nicest person and he took everything in stride and went above and beyond to get me into my beautiful Infiniti. If more places had customer service and reliable products things would roll much smoother. This place is amazing and Johnny is absoultely not your typical salesman who tries to get over.

I told them I was not going to pay an extra $1000 and why didn't they tell me when I told them I was gonna use my own financing before making me drive 80 miles. When I told them they where wrong for charging all these fees Raul said they could charge anything they wanted. there was also this other goofy looking employee individual who was hearing our conversation and decided to butt in our conversation and say they where not going to take away the dealer fee. My advice is stay away, very shady business and unprofessional individuals.<//review>< Pics>

These are some sleazy guys. Do NOT buy from them. They got me. The undercarriage guard fell off when I was on the highway. Looked under the car and there was frame damage that prevented the guard from fastening properly. Somehow there was nothing in the Carfax.< /review>

<Review>On Memorial Day Weekend 5-26-2018 we went to see an 07 Dodge Charger SRT8 color black at this dealer. We dealt with Raul. They told us nothing was wrong with the vehicle they had never had been in an accident there was no damage and that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle and that it had passed all safety dealer inspections. We purchased the vehicle...a few days after that we took it to a Certified mechanic because of car did not feel right. Come to find out it had frame damage, ball joints were hanging on by a few screws which put us in danger. Thank goodness nothing happened to us.the vehicle literally had plaster on the catalytic converter to cover a hole it had. The exhaust was bent and damaged. We returned with the vehicle and they were very hostile. Christian the sales manager was. They refused to let me speak to the owner. Christian said owner was not interested in speaking to us. They were trying to tell us that we had to take another vehicle from their lot when we were not Financed through them. we were financed through another credit company, we had been pre-approved at the end they knew they were wrong. they still made us pay a restocking fee for them to take the car back and unwind the contract on a vehicle that they knew and were aware that it was damaged.  I will never do business with these people again they took about 3 weeks to refund the money to the Creditor that we were approved from. They didn't even offer us a way home or a ride to the train station. We had to travel 3 hours back home in a train. BE AWARE OF THIS DEALER!<//Review><username>Sandra B</username>< Resp>

< review>
I don't know where these other people who wrote positive reviews went but it must have been a different dealer. Horrible service. Went with my wife and kid to check out a 2015 Ford Focus ST. We had an appointment but showed up about 30min early. We were walking around the dealer until we spotted the car and then we seated ourselves inside since no one acknowledged us outside. No one acknowledged us inside either. We waited for almost an hour before anyone spoke to us. Finally got helped out by Christian. He let us look at the interior of the car and let us start it up but didn't let us test drive it. All he wanted to do is talk numbers. Ended up buying the same year, make, model car at Autonation Ford Tustin. They actually let me test drive 2 cars I was interested in without needing anything other than my driver's license. OC Auto Exchange might have made a sale if I would have gotten to test drive the car to see how much I liked it.<//review>

Awful. Do not buy from OC Auto. I am so disappointed. They are dishonest and the cars are inferior. I should have went to CarMax. They will not be helpful when you go back to them with the problems with the car you bought from them. BEWARE!< /review>

<time>1416859708603< /time><Review>Before spending any money or traveling to OC Auto Exchange from Sacramento, I was informed by Jacob A. via email that the General Manager had authorized inspections (that I would arrange and pay for but they would take car to) and "... not only that, if you do decide to purchase the vehicle after the inspection, we would be willing to give you a 7-day return policy in writing." Relying upon that, I had the inspections done (I paid) and spent a couple days in travel and over $700 to see the car. I had the cashier's check for the full amount and placed it on Jacob's desk. While signing papers, Jacob informed me the 7-day return policy was changed. It was now 24 hours. I got up to leave. He talked with the General Manager and changed it to two days. I got up to leave. Then the policy was changed to four days. I got up to leave. Then the policy was changed to seven days after talking with the General Manager. Then I asked to see the written policy. The written policy had all kinds of restrictions like only for a major reason not reasonably obtained from the inspections or test drive. I got up to leave. After a discussion with the General Manager, he agreed to give me the 7-day return policy originally offered and accepted. During the paper signing, the General Manager came to Jacob's desk and said the "owners" wanted to add a 500 mile restriction to the 7-day return policy. The General Manager was totally aware that I was from Sacramento and the 500 mile restriction would barely get me home. What is the definition of "fraud"?<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Good cars but bought one from here 4 months ago and i have to many problems. Radiator is messed up brakes were trash i had to do an oil change bearlly 2months i had it. One of the windo switches was broken i had to fix it and more to add to this long list of fixing. I called and all they said i cant do nothing about it but can recommend a good car shop... recommend?! A car shop?! How about fix my car. They said maybe because i dont take car of my car. Really? Who would trash a new car? I treat this car like my second child trust me. Dont come here they NEVER tell you the truth about the cars. Only half of the truth. They didnt even let me apply for the car i wanted to i had to go for my second choice because i apparently cant afford the car i wanted or had enough credit. Theres alot more better dealers might as get a new car instead.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>We bought a car here less than a year ago.  Found out there was frame damage that wasn't disclosed and the car had been auctioned. NEVER buy here. We went over the car fax and had it inspected by another mechanic thinking we were doing our hometown. You won't be able to find out what the real history is behind the car you may be interested in. Go somewhere else!!!

These guys are sleazy salesman all they care about is how much money they can get from you. They tried giving me a 12.9 apr when I have flawless credit and bought the same vehicle from another dealership with the same down payment and got a 10.9 apr from them, mind you that was my first car I ever bought. NO CO-SIGNER. Now I’m trying to get a new vehicle same make model just less miles and they want to give me 12.9% because “high miles on the vehicle.” Oh really? My first car had 95k miles on it when I bought it. Their vehicle has 67k on it. But “high miles is why the apr would be 12.9”

These guys are sleezey. They don’t car about how much they screw you over they just want your money. The “salesman” more like “saleshack” I was working with was named Francisco and victor.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I bought a car for them, and a few days go by and boom everything went wrong with the car, I had to replace the battery, all 4 tires and it needed new break pads along with the center Console of my car where the AC comes out of needs to be completely replaced something that I did not want to take on at that moment. I called them and asked if there was anything they could do to help me they pretty much said it’s my problem now that I need to deal with it. It’s been over two months since I’ve had the car and I still have not yet received my licenses plates I actually called in a little while ago to ask someone, what is going on? and no one has any idea what’s going on over there, I could not get any direct answers. I have been transferred from person to person and I still have not received any answers about my license plates so I’m illegally driving around I was told they would give me a call back within about a half an hour and it’s been over an hour now. I’m writing this review because I feel as though I was completely taken advantage of and I don’t want that to happen to anyone else I very strongly recommend that you do not go here to look at a car or buy a car because they not only will take advantage of you, take your money but they will leave you to feel helpless and as though you made a huge mistake. I strongly, strongly, strongly suggest you do not buy a car here just don’t do it.< /text></record>

The OC Auto Exchange has a large selection of cars to choose from with affordable prices in the whole area. Their website is also up to date, which made it super easy for me to view which cars they had in stock and for what price. Jesse was quick to let me view the inside of 8 different cars they had in their lot and he was fast at retrieving carfax's and background information. There was NO hidden agendas. The VIN numbers are on the carfax. Nothing sketchy. The best thing I liked about Jesse was that he was not salesy whatsoever. He did not try to push for a sale. He allowed me some time to browse the lot and make my own decision on which car I liked the most. I even test drove several cars. Once I purchased my 2015 Hyundai Elantra in August 2018, it was a done deal. Jesse had my car cleaned and washed with a complimentary air freshener and he had filled up my car with gas before he gave me the keys to my car. They also provide new license plates, without you needing to go to the DMV yourself. This is customer service. The only thing I wanted to make sure I had was a spare key. I had to reach out to Jesse again for this, but it wasn't a hassle at all. My car still runs like brand new, no problems 4 months later. Thank you Jesse for being patient, professional, honest, and not salesy with me. I would recommend and come back to OC Auto Exchange.</text>

<Review>This place was a big disappointment. I came to this dealership with intentions to buy a particular vehicle and they happened to have a couple I was interested in. I called a day ahead and spoke with a “Tony” with the hopes that they would have the vehicles somewhat ready for a test drive and/or a purchase. Well to my surprise not only did they not have the vehicles ready, neither vehicle could be test driven if I even wanted to. The first car looked like it was in an accident. It looked nothing like the pictures advertised. The front bumper had extensive damage and was missing the grill insert. The fuel door was also missing. Taking a look inside the vehicle only brought more disappointment when I noticed the excessive amount of trash in the back seat.  Fast food, empty cups, etc. “Tony” left me out in the lot with the keys and went back inside. Very unprofessional but then who would take this POS. So I returned the keys once I found “Tony” and figured I’ll go look at the other car. Well that was gonna be a short viewing being that as I walked towards the vehicle I can see a very flat rear tire that I’m sure is still very flat. At this point I was not surprised being that I had just wasted a 45 min drive.  But I do want to say THANK YOU to this sad excuse of a dealership bc I was not going to let this trip be a waste. Thanks to modern technology I was able to find a dealership, that not only showed professionalism during my visit, but was able to get me into a car that night. If you are in the market to buy a car I say stop by this place, then go somewhere else after your disappointment. You will appreciate the vehicle you buy elsewhere that much more.<//Review>< Pics>

<time>1529116651303</time><Rate>1</Rate><review>My mom bought a 2013 Ford escape from this dealer. Jesse helped her find the car and we thought we everythig was great, until 2 days ago when she entered the car and the door wouldn’t close. She had to tie it down with a belt, just so that it wouldn’t stay open, and she had to drive home with the car this way. We come to find out that there were 5 recalls on the car starting from 2016, it wouldn’t have cost the dealership anything to get it fixed, all they had to do was take it to a ford dealer. Instead they chose to sell my mother an unsafe car, which could have caused a major accident. The car needs to get the computer, the locks, and the airbags changed, which means that we won’t have access to it for a few more days. A major inconvenience as her job requires that she travel constantly. So thanks for the car Jesse, I don’t we will be seeing or recommending you anytime soon.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Do your research, and don't shop here. I purchased a 2013 Honda Civic here and 2 months later the car needed both a new battery, and a radiator ($400 down the drain). The worst car purchase ever, they overprice the cars in order to maximize their profits. And they don't even invest in fixing the cars before selling them. There's not a day that I don't regret purchasing the car. I wish I would've read these reviews before purchasing.<//text>< pics>

Called about a new car they "just got in the lot."  Chris said it's at the mechanic for smog and it'll be ready tomorrow.  1.5 weeks later it was still not ready.  Chris had poor communication too. Couldn't answer simple questions about the car like what trim it is.  Turns out it took so long because they were trying to repair the damaged car. and hide it.  Story seems to be similar to the other stories from here.  AVOID this place.</Review><userid>104393144676594285587<//userid>< pics>

Do not buy vehicles from this dealer. They sold me a car with a normal Carfax and only 6000 miles BUT THE WARRANTY WAS BLOCKED. They did not inform me and sold it for full price. Now I have an expensive car with no warranty. They are DISHONEST AND SHADY.</Review>

I saw a car on cargurus. I e_mail them, I called them and confirm the car. I took the two and a half hours bus ride to get their. I spoke to a few sales men, they were ver nice. I made the contact with Chris, he showed me the car the price was right, I inspected the car I liked it, I ask to test drive it. I drove great. I had things to replace: like the tires and fix my A/C, Chris is on it. So I bought my car.  Thanks Chris. Thank you OC auto Exchange.<//review>

<Text>So I recently got a Lexus IS from here a few months back and thought I'd give my insight. I looked for a few weeks not too extensively, but came across these guys and they had what I was looking for. So I checked em out, and the car was what they posted in the ad, which is a good start now an days. It went pretty smooth during the test drive, the salesman wasn't too pushy and seemed genuine, we talked about mileage and pricing etc and by the end of the day I was still undecided. They left me their card and told me to give them a call, he wasnt too persistant which was nice.
I gave it some thought for about a week, went back there and decided to take it if they negotiated the price a little. I didn't get exactly what I ask but they we're fair at a meeting point. We filled out all the papers and contracts, and didn't have really any problems with the terms! So over all it was pretty smooth and the salesman was decent, he didn't nag or persist at me. And till this day my car is running great, so I can say it's a success<//Text>< rating>

Worst experience I have ever had with a car dealership.  Sales Rep, Sales Manager and General Manger all very dishonest, arrogant and incredibly condescending.  They treated me as if I was stupid. They do their best to rip you off.  I ended up walking out and getting a better deal somewhere else.  Do not buy a car from these people.<//text>

!!!HIDDEN FEES!!! went in early Jan for a used Accord. Andrew was nice. we agreed on my trade in value & 750$ discount on their accord. left 50$ cash deposit. would come back the next business day with check in hand to finish the deal (i live 90 miles away). noticed before got too far from dealership theres a 300$ theft device fee on there. called andrew & he apologized saying he & his manager forgot to mention it. asked to speak to manager but said manager is gone. looped back there & saw manager was standing 20 feet from him at the door. went home & noticed they were also charging me about 570$ for license/reg fees when it should have cost less than 200$. did the math & realized they had basically rolled back the 750$ discount. Nice! waited a few weeks & went back & got my deposit. Spent About 100$ in gas not to buy a Car. True Story but your results may Vary.< /text>

I just found out this dealership ripped off a relative of mine out of $5,000. They sold him a Mercedes that had a bad suspension. He tool k it to the dealership to get it fixed and told them they needed to pay since he had it towed to the dealership the same day he bought it. Instead of stepping up and fixing the lies they repossessed the vehicle cancelled his contract and kept his $5,000 down payment. For everyone reading this stay away from this rip off dealership at any cost and under no no circumstances should you ever buy anything from them unless you get it inspected by a third party inspection facility. Save yourself the time, money and headaches. Also this dealership will not be in business for much longer the relative of mine happens to be an attorney he is currently suing them, filed a formal complaint with the depart of motor vehicle and better business bureau.<//text>

<text>This was a very bad experience. Salesman were vey shady and dishonest, because they sold me a car that had a door that was a different color, and I didn't find out till I left the dealer because they stalled and kept me waiting so they wouldn't have to wash the car and could not tell that it was two shades of silver. These people think we are stupid and try to con us out of our money. All they would do for me is send it to a shop where o would have to pay to get it painted. It also had other defects that were not pointed out to me.i called and left several messages and they would not return my call. Finall he called back and said there was nothing he could do..I do not recommend by one buying a car here<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

For sure scam artists the car I was looking at was $8999 but somehow when they did the math for a 5 year loan it came out to $234 a month....it took me all of a minute to walk out on the deal, all the good reviews are definitely paid for or themselves it's a shame that companies can boost themselves like that.< /review>

Andrew was the gentleman that helped me . Maybe this guys is the golden ticket here . From all the reviews I feel bad for their experiences and cannot speak for them but my experience with Andrew was very good he was very helpful and honest he gave me the price cut I wanted (pay cash) and was forthcoming and didn't deny the flaws the car had that I had mentioned . To me that meant a lot . Theres nothing worse than a car salesman trying to play you for an idiot . Andrew also told me to bring car back when I had a chance to get window fixed (got stuck rolling up ) and gas gauge looked at (does not work) . But Andrew was Awesome and put me in an affordable car that I liked LIKE and runs good . He was VERY nice and NOT fake nice either you know salesmen they can sometimes leave a bad tainted cheap impression . Not this time . Thank You Andrew for the experience memory and Camaro ! CHEERS to you.< /text>

< review>
These guys are total slimeballs. I was honestly willing and ready to purchase a car from them out of state and called the dealership. Never once was the phone answered in a pleasant manner, it was more as though
I was inconveniencing them by calling, a matter of fact "ya what do you want" attitude. Then I scheduled a pre-purchase inspection. They not only did not deliver the car on time but they didn't even remember the appointment I set up with them the day before. After 3 hours they still had not been able to produce the car, and they assured me multiple times that the car was within minutes of arriving. Never panned out. This is not the kind of place you want to take your money. They cannot be trusted and will not deliver on your requests nor will they be respectful to you as a customer.< /review>

Those guys are shady like a dark cloud. Told me the DMV fees were a $1000 on a SUV I wanted to buy. Oddly enough that was the trade in value of my car. I checked with the DMV and the fees were less than $200. The salesman said n I qoute,
If you pay to much for the DMV fees
they will refund you. While that statement is true, the fee amount I was told was a straight out Lie.
Just Another Bunch of Shady Car Salermen.</text>

I had a pleasent experience buying my car here. There is a rather large dealer fee and other typical expenses attatched to the internet price so be ready for about 1,500 - 2,000 above what the car is listed at. I payed cash for my vehical and got a fair price.
I was sent a 2$ check because they estimated my registration fee at the DMV too high 😂 I thought it was funny and it pushed me to right a review.
I was able to test drive the car and they fixed the things I wanted them to. I found gum in one of the cigarette power ports which was annoying and didn't really think they cleaned the vehical inside too much when I bought it but it was already very clean anyway.</Review>

<Text>Do not buy a car here. They specialize in selling junk titles and ripping people off. Also they know they can make more money off you through high interest financing avoid they financing option if possible.  Horrible experience!

Do not buy cars at these dealerships unless you're looking for issues!! I also bought a car back in 2014, not only did car have bald tires, one of the tires rim was cracked, no shift knob they placed a so called spare knob just to drive me back to Las Vegas and replaced 2 of the tires and the rim cracked. The car I bought there was 07 Honda Si which seemed in good condition taking aside the mention items. I had problems getting refunded for my registration from them who assured I would not be charged again in Nevada for registering since I had paid when buying car. After arguing with them few times in phone I had to mention I was getting an attorney & that's when they proceeded sending me back my $500 I paid them for registering! Few weeks after driving car I started noticing a little noise coming from my left front tire, i then took off tire & noticed so much corrosion all over pads rotors and noticed plenty more throughout the car. Like if the car was junked for some time!! I then took it to my buddy shop & he said noise was due to tie rod and bad axle. Then it flash to me, that's what happens when you buy a used car & not having much mechanical experience. Problem didn't ended there, as my buddy told me the car must of been in an accident and they welded the left suspension instead of replacing it. I was disbelief until I saw for myself the suspension welded!!  It's been 2 years and the car's paint is fastly fading and after reading the previous reviews I had to share my review and umpleasant experience.  I'm left to assure that these people are nothing but scum bags & buy cars from auctions, re paint them and keep them under a clean title to only rip off needed customers!! Please be very careful if your thinking of buying car from these people.< /review>

Horrible experiance at this dealer, I bought a genesis coupe a while back, there was no negotiating on the price, I checked it out the best I could on the floor but once I bought it and had a chance to lift the car I. the air I found it was sold to me missing suspension components, it was missing a sway bar end link. also it had the tire threads showing on the inner edge of both front tires, the alarm didn't work and they said it was just the battery but that didn't fix it. I then found the interior dome lights didn't work, I removed them to see if the bulb was out and found the entire harness above the headliner causing the rear window defroster to not work either. I'm pretty sure it is illegal to sell a car like those. brand new off the lot and already a unsafe to drive. they also said it passed smog yet it had an eBay special 30 dollar intake that will fail visual inspection.

<Review>These scumbags try to boost their rating by posting 5 Star reviews anonymously! Take a look for yourself! Here's my story.

Their prices may seem reasonable but they are still over priced for the vehicle you are receiving. About a year ago I went there to look at a  Dodge Ram. The tires looked like slicks and truck was in need of some serious work. I wondered the dealership and office for 25min with no one to be seen so I left. Maybe just an off day? I wish.

Recently (3 weeks ago) I purchased a 2008 Nissan Titan with 88,xxx miles with the trade in of my current vehicle (2007 Nissan Xterra). The truck was in some serious need for attention but that is with any used car close to 88-thousand miles. The tires were bald, the battery was flat-lined, and the wheels looked sub $20. The price was hard to beat though. Before the time of purchase, I took the vehicle to get inspected and the car checked out clean of frame damage and leaks. I went back and asked if they could give me some new tires for the price, they answered no. They assured me no, frame damage, all electrics worked, and all fluids were topped. The first night I had it I got pulled over for one of the headlights being out. So car was not legally street worthy. Last week I went in for a more detailed inspection. The shop found that the car only had half of a quart of oil and was bone dry on coolant. So no leaks and yet the car magically lost 6 quarts of oil and all of it's coolant? I don't think so.

A few days ago I attempted to take off the wheels to clean the calipers and change the brake pads. First wheel came off no problem. Second wheel the first lug nut wasn't fully on! So I tried to take it off by hand only to discover that the lug stud its self had broken off! I called the dealership immediately and addressed all of my concerns in a calm manner. The manager said it's not their fault and that I should have brought it up when I bought the car. I mentioned that the fluids were empty he replied by saying that he had proof that they topped it off and did a full inspection including replacing the tires. Yeah. No they did not. I asked if they could simply fix the lug because I was unable to remove the lug nut and he said there was nothing he could do. I even said I didn't mind the headlights or fluids and all I wanted was the lug stud to be fixed. I mentioned that I would like to solve this peacefully but I know the law states he can not sell a car that is not road worthy and that I don't mind going to court to fight it. He said he has an attorney and he'll see me there; and then proceeded to hang up. Customer service? Nonexistent.

But enough about the vehicle, lets talk about them personally.

The day after I bought the truck I noticed that I had left my parking permit in the car I had traded in. I called and asked if they could get it out so i could pick it up. They said yes. I drove over there (30miles) the next day and asked for the permit. They said they hadn't had a chance to get it yet so i asked if i could go get it. They politely said yes but could not find the keys. I was there for two hours when I decided to get up and leave and asked them to mail it to me. Two hours! Lastly. I checked their website earlier tonight to look at the vehicle that I traded in. The details are so false! I did not have heated seats, dual zone climate control, or a sunroof! Whom ever decides to go see that car is going to be disappointed. PLEASE spend your money else where. I have purchased 3 vehicles and this was the most unpleasant dealership there is. They don't deserve your business and you deserve someone who will treat you right during the car buying process!</Review>< user>

This place is very UNPROFESSIONAL. I haven't even driven off the lot yet and I'm already dissatisfied with the customer service. The very first car I test drove had empty Taco bell cups and bags from someone's lunch. Once all paperwork was done and completed (should just have to grab the keys and leave right) two guys run in and grab the keys and take the car for about 30 mins. After time goes by I ask where my car is and the salesman (no clue of his name...sad right) tells me that they went to check the Vin numbers with the bank. I'm like it's 645 at night and MLK day so where are they going to get the number ran at? Mr. No name car guy...I think Christian maybe... tells me some random thought and goes to see how long before they are back. Minutes pass and he comes back and tell me that they went to have the car smogged. My first question is why wait until now when I'm ready to drive off and once again he has no clue. The paperwork was super easy. Of course the price fluctuated quite a bit but what else to expect from these places. My experience was horrible. No I ne greeted us that actually worked there ever. There was even a guy that came in and addressed our salesman directly and didn't address us. When I'm spending my money everybody better say "hey". Bottom line don't look for good service just credit approval here. Credit approval only. The car better have no problems or my next complaint will be lengthy-errrrr!<//Review>

I have bought a car from LA Auto Exchange, the sister company of OC Auto Exchange. My sales experience was not awesome except for the sales person John. However, LA Auto Exchange gave me a lot of run around for weeks on getting my car title although the car was paid in full at the spot. Needless, it was a nightmare not being able to drive the car without the title in my name.

When it was finally escalated to Adrian, the title and registration manager, it was magically done. He single handed saved all my issues in under 2 days. He was professional, helpful and was very sympathetic of my situation. He sped up all the documents and overnighted to me as he promised. He took pictures of the documents and texted them to me before he sent the documents to me. He also gave me the Fedex tracking number. He also gave me step by step instruction so I could get it done in the DMV with a different state. I could not be more thankful to him. Without him, I would still be in the same predicament of not able to drive the car around.

I simply want to write a review on Adrian. He is really an outstanding professional.< /text>

Save the headache, buy from a dealership. Not a bad salesman, he was cool, just the aftermath of the sale was a mess.</text>

I dislike this dealership, looking online they had a lot of the cars i was looking for so it was defently a one stop shop, after getting there and parking by the front office no one came out, i saw a one of the cars i liked so i  walk to it and a worker walk in my derection after 5 minutes had passed, he got into a car avoided eye contact and drove off, i was on their lot about 35  to 40 minutes multiple people walk by and didn't say a word to me. Maybe its because im young but guess what my 20 grand is a good a the 50 year old 20 grand. I left the lot after looking at all the cars i was interested in, you could see paint brushes and scratches being covered with horrible body work and paint work. I will never buy a car from these place. Instead i drove a fee miles and got a brand new car at weir canyon honda, where i was greeted and treat correctly. They would have gotten an easy self if they got their heads out of their ass. Stay away from this place.</text>

You know I waited about 3 months to write a review for this company. Im glad it took me this long at first I would've been a promoter for this "company" now I am a defactor. Do not invest with this company their work ethics are absurd . I purchased a 2004 infiniti G35 from them they probably saw me as a young guy so they will take advantage. When I left the Dealsership I noticed in the freeway my breaks where gone ! What kind of crap is that? What if I gotten into a accident that could've been my life their for some defaulty breaks. 2 months later my car starts over heating crazy they used water instead of anti-freeze so most of my system was oxidized like come on its general chemistry 101. They didn't want to do anything about that I was carless for 2 weeks and I am a college student and work. One last thing my plates and regrestation did not come for about 3 months.  So I advise you do not buy from this company PLEASE DO NOT !!!!!!!!!! The cars look nice outside but they're crappy inside. This comany does not handle its business professinally its complete ludicrous.<//Text>

My first option was to buy a 2016 Chevy truck they had for sale but the sales guy said I didn't qualify for that truck with out running my credit (I think because the way I look) thanks to him I ended up buying a new 2017 from Martin Chevrolet which was my second option.</Text>

We called USA Electric on a Sunday afternoon to repair some lighting in our playhouse. The girl that answered the phone was very nice and told me that someone will call me back in a short while. I got a returned phone call in less then 5 minutes and was able to get an electrician to come over and take care of the issue before the doors opened for the show. Kenny, the electrician was very knowledgable and repaired the problem quickly. I am very happy with their service and will call them again from now on.< /text>

<review>I recently had my microwave go out so I looked online and found USA Electric. From the initial call to make an appointment everything about this experience has been perfect! Jeremy was out service repairman and he was extremely knowledgeable and very polite and absolutely on time! I would use this company and recommend it to anyone with electrical problems.

Jeremy upgraded a 50 amp breaker for a new steam generator and hooked up an attic fan.

My service window was 11:30 to 1:30 - he arrived promptly at 11:30.

Great communication via text and good attitude. He had all of the parts with him in his sizable service truck.  Was done in one hour.

Highly recommend and will use them again.< /Text>

The whole process from coming out to my home for a quote, planning with LADWP the specifications of the project and then the final execution of installing a new electric panel was done with seamless professionalism. They came in and got the job done on time and left everything clean and ready to go. I would definitely recommend USA ELECTRIC to anyone looking for a experienced electrician.<//review>< rate>

A 100% professional in any way! They are fast in identifying the problem, proposing and communicating the best solution and getting it done. This company is in any way worth the money they charge and therefore a shining example of a 5 star electrician company!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1601923863357, 'text': 'Thank you Marco for your business.

Jeremy was professional, knowledgeable and courteous. He was able to answer questions I had about future upgrades and made the fixture's wiring more convenient to do so. The service was fast, friendly and competitively priced.</Review>

I received a cost and time estimate for installing a ceiling fan in a bedroom with no existing fan and changing the light switch.
They were very professional, kept to their cost and time estimate and cleaned up well before leaving.  They were very friendly, too.  I've used them before to problem solve a severed pool equipment wire.  Prices are reasonable.  I will use USA Electric in the future.<//Text>

<Text>Due to the current pandemic, I was scared to invite anyone into my home because my husband is at a higher risk, but USA Electric came prepared. I called them to do some emergency repairs and they were not only very professional, but very safe and cleanly. They wore gloves, masks, and did everything they could to keep clean. They also maintained their distance wherever they could. I am very happy with their work and I have some peace of mind now. Thank you very much USA Electric!!

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Top notch service! Called USA Electric to come out to my rental building and give me a quote for replacing the old sub-panels in the apartments. My insurance company required the replacement in order to renew my policy, so I had to do the work within a short time period. Kenny and USA Electric gave me the best price for the work needed, and was very easy to work with. They did a very nice job with very minimal damage to the walls. The power for the apartments was turned off for a short time, and the entire building was completed in 4 days. These guys know their work. They are professional, efficient, and competitive. Thanks to USA Electric, my insurance company is off my back.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1588639962726, 'text': 'Hello Christian.

These guys were great! The estimate and the work were both spot on. Jeremy came, looked at the scope of work, gave us a quote right away and the work was scheduled and performed. They installed new recessed lights, ceiling fans and a brand new electrical panel. All of the work was finished in two days and we were more that’s pleased!! We will definitely use USA Electric again!</text>

I am an interior designer and have been struggling for years to find a reliable electrician. That is until I found USA Electric and the wonderful crew that works there.
They always go above and beyond in order to make sure I am happy with the work. The work was done in a very professional and clean way, at a fair price. They are the only company I can trust with my high end projects.<//Text>

I have been referred to USA Electric by my handyman. I had random flickering lights in my condo and my handyman told me that he could not fix it, and recommended that I call USA electric. I was very happy with the entire service. I was able to get a tech out in 3.5 hours from the time I’ve called, Kenny the technician was very nice and knowledgeable. He gave me a reasonable price for the repair and explained to me the cause of the problem. I have been worried that my home will catch on fire, but thanks to USA Electric, I feel safe again.</review>

<time>1563606944549</time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Terrible service I asked to get some pricing for two big remodels they said they were not interested and hung up on me. All called  a different location to hopefully talk to somebody else same guy picked up. And was really rude would not give me a reason and hung up.
I been a Contractor for 30 years never has anyone of my subs or trades been so rude with first contact.
I will pass with there services as first impression says a lot.

Thanks for the response The dispatcher was not courteous at all he could have simple said that you do not provide  bids for new contractual agreements that have not been awarded, I did call another location thinking I would get some one who could give us a quote for two projects. I simply  asked why ( maybe to busy, or maybe out of work area, but no explanation just stated was not interested in a very rude way.
I had thought USA Electrical was a big enough company to handle two medium size remodels from the ads that are posted in four different areas.
So calling around to your different ad listing they all go to the same individual. As I got the same individual with the same bad attitude. If any of our employees answered the phone that way they would not work for my company as the first rule is to be respectful and courteous to all clients.
Perhaps just say on your ad we do not provide bids only for contractors who have been awarded the project. Not to worry we were rewarded both contracts and found a curious and respectful electrical company to work with.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1563500352403, 'text': "Hello Kevin. We are sorry to hear about your phone experience. Following a brief investigation of your recorded phone calls, we have not found any fault in the way our dispatcher responded to your call. The dispatcher was courteous and expressed to you that our company is not interested in bidding your project, (which you haven't won yet). You have called multiple times and insisted to know why. The dispatcher has explained numerous times that he only follows our company's policy, but you have refused to accept that answer.\n\nSince USA Electric follows very strict work ethics and all ethical and trade rules and regulations, and in order to keep our pricing competitive, we have decide to save our resources, and not bid on contractor projects that have not been won.\n\nWe wish you all the best, and hope that we will be able to help on your next won projects in the future."}<//response>

<Time>1559676077245<//Time><Name>gene oster</Name><Review>We had a new 200 amp panel installed a few days ago.  It was a wonderful experience from start to finish.  Communication with the office staff was outstanding; we were notified when conformation was needed, and ahead of time a day before work was scheduled, and again 30 minutes before workers were to arrive.  USA is one of the most professional companies we have ever done business with.  Jeremy and Brian were a delight to work with; not only was the work performed with expertise, but both men were cheerful and made us feel like we were the most important people in the world.  The work was done when scheduled and finished on time and within budget; the job site was left neat and clean.  We will use USA Electric  any time we have future needs and highly recommend them to all who need electrical service.</Review>< resp>

<review>Technician was very knowledgeable and very helpful in trying to find a solution.  Company was a referral from a Hard Rock Handyman as he said they were honest and hard working and a family owned company.  Def agree and would refer them anytime.<//review>< username>

I cannot say enough good things about USA Electric! I purchased an old house (built in 1946)and needed to have the entire home rewired since it was knob & tube. Kenny Ron and the entire crew did a phenomenal job, finished on time and under budget!! Would I call them again? You bet.< /Review>

Kenny and his team are knowledgeable, professional, and they do A+ work.  They rewired our entire house and their level of attention to detail was amazing. They were extremely affordable for the amount of work and quality of work they did - and we will never use any other electrical companies.

Jeremy and Bryan were very quick and efficient with rehanging our chandelier that had come lose from the ceiling. They were very careful with the chandelier and cleaning it afterwards. We are very happy with their work and are getting quotes for additional electrical work at our house. Would definitely recommend USA Electric.< /review>

Excellent work by Kenny, Ron and the helpers. I highly recommend this company and will use them again at any time. They came out and gave a very fair estimate to install an EV charger and rewire my garage. Job was done quickly and they kept it within budget. We pass inspection first time. Their bid was the lowest out of 4 other contractors and they are the only one that offers lifetime warrenty. This company has it all no need to look anywhere else.<//review>

Mike showed upon time and was completely professional.  After describing the repair, he got to work immediately and completed the job that included moving a socket downward about 12 inches and repairing a small hole to the wall and the cleaning of the area where he worked.  I have had many contractors in my home lately because of my kitchen remodel and Mike with USA Electric has been the most polite and professional of them all.  I found them on Google and I'm glad I did.< /text>

<Text>I would Agee 100% with the review given by another lady customer (I couldn't have said it better myself)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there a way to give 100 stars? USA Electric is seriously the best electrical company in Los Angeles. Kenny and his team are knowledgeable, professional, and they do A+ work. They rewired our entire house and their level of attention to detail was amazing. They were extremely affordable for the amount of work and quality of work they did - and we will never use any other electrical companies. Best of all, they are a family operated business and they are very honest, decent, and ethical people. We are so happy they helped us and I would highly recommend them to anyone.</Text>< Name>

We contracted for installation of a NEST Doorbell.  They were unsuccessful and our NEST still does not work.  They clearly did not have experience with NEST doorbells. They wanted additional fees for coming out to problem solve.  Be careful when you contract them to install a NEST device.< /review>

{'time': 1547500684647, 'text': "Hello Mr. Schneider, we are sorry to learn that you are unhappy with our service. We have installed hundreds of Nest and similar doorbell devices with great success. Our contract was to install power to your Nest device only and that is what we have done. As we have explained before the service started, for liability reasons, we do not provide device configuration to devices supplied by the client. Although our contract was to install power to your Nest doorbell only, we have complimentary spent over an hour to try and help with the configuration of your Nest doorbell. Our technician downloaded the Nest app to your cell phone, and began the configuration process, but unfortunately the device did not connect to your WIFI network. Before leaving, the technician guided you of the configuration process and advised to retry it after checking your WIFI signal and compatibility with Nest. We have also offered to provide Nest's tech support phone number to continue troubleshooting the connection issue with them. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions. We thank you for your business."}< /Resp>

Gail, Kenny, and their entire team really know what they are doing. We had many electricians out to try and solve our problems, but no one could figure it out. Kenny kept trying until he found the right solution. He always kept us in the loop and explained everything thoroughly. Beyond professional!< /review>

I WOULD GIVE 0 STARS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE but i had to select 1 otherwise this wouldn't post!
My goodness I cant believe these people as pushy as they are they certainly do not keep appointments! Nor do they value my time. I took the time off work to have them come out to my house. They stated they had offices everywhere, 1 being just a few blocks from me. 15 minutes after our scheduled time I called and they told me they'd be here within 30 minutes. 40 minutes went by to have them tell me the technician got hung up at the last job. They needed to reschedule. I understand things happen but this was totally unprofessional!<//review>

Great overall service! Had USA Electric come to my restaurant to repair power issue after 2 other electricians told me that I have to rewire my place up, and left without fixing it. Kenny and his helper were able to diagnose the problem within an hour and a half, and fixed up the problem. The price was fair and the service was professional. My only regret is that I didn’t call them earlier. Now I know where to call for any other future electrical issues. I recommand this business for any one who wants quick and reliable service with honost pricing.</text>

I called these guys on a Friday and they were on site Monday to bid the job. They came back the next day to completed the job. It was a little on the expensive side but the fact it was done so quickly and the quality was excellent so the value was worth it. I'll definitely be using them in the future.</text>

WATCH OUT! These people are rip offs ! They came out to my house and the quote for installing a small chandelier was $650.00! I told them I had to think about it. They became extremely rude and told me I owe them $49 for (pretty much a handshake)coming out.  I thought the quote was a little steep so I called 2 other electricians. Got a quote for $250.00 and $300.00 this company is ridiculous and I don't know how the  can sleep at night !< /text>

Best service in West Hollywood. They answear the phone promptly and schedule an appointment for the next morning. I got a call and a text when the tech was 30 min away. He walked with me around the house and gave detailed and professional consultation. I got an affordable estimate same day and I was happy to hire this company to do the job.  I was extremley satisfied with the resault . Professional clean and high quality.
I would hire again any time and highly recommend. Give them a call and you will be happy .< /Text>

Usa Electric sent Kenny to repair an electrical problem that 2 other electricians I called before did’nt know how to deal with. He is knowledgeable and experienced and was able to solve the problem quickly. I am so happy to finally find a professional electrician as honest as Kenny.
I will call him again to install some LED recessed lights in my kitchen and strongly recommend his electrical services. Life time labor warrenty was highly appreciated.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b94b2c6731ad:0x21fd6962453bb951< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

USA Electric is fantastic. I appriciate how Kenny kept me updated and informed the entire time he and his crew rewired our house. He is extremley knowledgable and friendly and met my requirements and budget. Easy to do business with and clean work. I alreday reffered USA Electric to my mother for a panel upgrade.
Highly recommend.<//text>

< Review>
Interesting historically.  Enjoyed the Mission State Park, and the mission plaza is a nice park with the oldest wooden home in Santa Cruz facing it.  Historical district.</Review>

My favorite vampiric like church. Actually, it's the only one i know of personally. Has a warm inviting feel with all the prayer candles glowing yet a nice creepy dark vibe with the statues and centuries old woodwork.<//Text>

Nice little Park located in front of the Holy Cross Church. This, together with Mission Santa Cruz, makes the area very interesting.<//Review>

< Review>
Don't use this guy. I had a problem with my heating core and he claimed he would fix it. 1200 dollars later everything seemed fine for about two years, then it gave out again. I went to a dealership this time and had it fixed for real. When I called him to check the warranty on the part he kept giving me the same old song and dance he did before. He then proceeds to offer me 100 dollars for it almost two years later. IT may seem a nice gesture but it is apparent to me its because he know its his fault. Don''t listen to this guy, just go somewhere else.< /Review>

my lexus engine was misfiring. I called Emad to check it and he had it ready for a very reasonable price the next day. After some engine work my car is running  very smooth and no issue since then already 3 months. Same job at the local dealership would have ended adding up more and more in repairs. Having found this place is one of my best move.<//review>

<text>Always have a good experience. I chose them because of reviews like the one I'm writing. And, they did not disappoint. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Car serviced in a timely manner.

Emad and his team at J&E Auto Service have kept our family's cars running well for more than a decade. I can't imagine trusting the maintenance of our cars to anyone else. I highly recommend Emad as a man you can trust to do what's right for you and your autos, with integrity, with reliable results, at a fair price. Thanks, Emad!< /text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>It has been 3 weeks since I visited. I waited to write my review until I drove my car a bit. I am very happy with the service that was performed. I had a high pressure power steering hose replaced and both lower control arms. The work was done to the quoted price and was completed when they said. They may not be the least expensive compared to a few other shops, but they are far less expensive than a dealer and the work was done properly. I do wish they had cleaned up some of the power steering fluid  from the under carriage as it continued to drip for a few days following the work. The best review I can give is: I will return to these guys the next time I need work done and felt as though I was treated with honesty and integrity. I would recommend this shop.<//Text>< pics>

<time>1605290562772< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I've been in and out of this place several times throughout my years in Los Angeles. I must say they are one of the ONLY places where I got an honest opinion. The Chevy Dealership in Burbank completely screws up diagnosing my vehicle, but J&E Complete has always been honest and up front and told me the actual issues. They even said that certain things should be under warranty and take it back and tell them this or that about that issue I've had. They're very knowledgeable and good people. I cannot recommend this place enough.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c102edfda151:0x39171d37f36c5d8a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the best place in Los Angeles County to get your car repaired! I took my car to three other shops and they couldn't figure it out. Took my car here once and they fixed it immediately and my car has run fantastic ever since! Fantastic auto shop!!</Text>

My Toyota 1999 4Runner needed an engine rebuild. Emad did a great job my car is like new. He went above and beyond. The price was perfect. He made this look easy. I truly appreciate it will do business again. I highly recommend him if you need an engine rebuild he knows what he is doing. Simply great job!< /Review>

The best place in town. The guys were so kind and professional. They did the breaks on my Jeep for a great price. They gave me and my son a ride home while they worked on it and they gave us a ride back to the shop when it was all done. I’m going there for all my vehicles needs. Thanks guys!< /Text>

J&E is great! I had a flat tire and brought my car in super last minute. Emad helped assess my car's needs within about 15 minutes of my arrival even though his lot was pretty busy. He helped me determine that I needed all four tires (they were so bald!!) and was able to get the job done in under two hours. He also offered hand sanitizing wipes for any time I needed to sign anything or be at the front desk. Overall a great experience and a really nice team of people.</Review>

<Text>I am a very happy customer. I've now taken 3 vehicles to J & E over the last several years. First of all, Emad is very personable- he remembers me, my vehicles & what precise service I want. Second, he always provides me with an accurate estimate of cost & time. Third- the crucial things we all want from a mechanic- EXPERIENCE, HONESTY & the ability the TRUST. I can say with confidence that Emad has these qualities. He won't try to sell me on service I don't need or ask for. He will tell me if there's a safety concern I'm not aware of. If there is an issue that doesn't have to be fixed right away or the use of the vehicle doesn't require everything to be in top-notch condition, Emad will let me know. If you've been trying to find a reliable mechanic, look no further!</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c102edfda151:0x39171d37f36c5d8a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Have taken my truck here twice. This place is honest and always does a great job. The owner Emad cares about your car problems and makes them his and ensures the problems are fixed and checks with you after you get your car back that your happy with everything.  I definitely recommend this place.< /Review>

J&E is fantastic!  They really took care of me (twice).  They are honest and down to earth.  They were quick and efficient.  They even sent me a text message to check in a few days after I picked up my car.

Before taking my car in the first time, I had a mechanic friend of mine check the error codes, labor estimate and pricing for parts.  Unfortunately his shop was too busy to fix my car within the timeline I needed.   I then went to J&E and sure enough their diagnoses lined up exactly with what my friend reported.  Even the pricing was spot on.

This is a great place!< /review>

They’ve helped me get my 95 Bronco running like a dime, after I struggled with electrical issues for months.

This is an excellent, no-nonsense mechanic. I was traveling from out of town and got an honest opinion on my truck from which helped me make the long journey home safely. They gave me a thorough diagnosis and road test and were extremely punctual and generous about it. I was very lucky to have found them and would recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

Brought my car in for smaller repairs, and the team at J&E did everything with great professionalism. They were always upfront about what they were about to do with the car. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the repairs of my car, but they didn't even charge me for an extra inspection I asked for, and I left with a very fair price.

I needed replace the transfer bar on my Subaru Forester. The dealership wanted $1,600 for parts and labor.
J&E did an excellent job replacing the transfer bar and because the price difference was so drastically lower than the dealership, I replaced the struts (which were on their last legs) too. All this cost me almost $500 less than the dealership wanted for just the transfer bar.
In addition to a very fair price, everyone there was friendly and welcoming. Every time I communicated with them, they all addressed me by my name, which to me, shows respect enough to know with whom you are doing business.
Lastly, I don’t think I needed to wait more than 5 minutes for anything; I dropped off and picked up, but was always serviced promptly.
I will be returning for any future needs and will be recommending them to everyone I can.</text>

This is a great Auto Service. Emad is kind and honest. My Twenty year old daughter was diving to LA from Utah when her Honda broke down. As you can imagine both my daughter and myself was freaking out and did not know what to do. I read the reviews to J&E and decided to take her car there. Emad was wonderful and assure us he could fix the problem and gave us a good price. I felt a relief to find some one honest. Thank you for taken care of my daughters car and for reliving my stress.</review>

I went to this place because of the good reviews. Had my belt tensor replaced. They did a great job at a good price.

Completely satisfied, will definitely be back. They seem like very honest hardworking folks here</review>

These guys are great. Prices are unbeatable and they go above and beyond for the customer.  I got a transmission service, oil change, tire rotation, and car wash for the same price that a quick lube place wanted to charge for just the transmission service.<//Text>

< Review>
Just do yourself a favor and go here. I have an older car and all of the repairs cost about half of the price of my other quotes. Plus they did a much better job fixing and replacing different parts and wires in my car than who I originally paid to fix it. They were really friendly and worked with my school schedule. I definitely wish I had come here first instead of the issues and hassle of pep boys or hauling my car around to different shops.< /Review>

Coool place car service /shop
Nice place to leave your car for service and any repair you need.
If you're looking for a mechanic you can trust, try this shop and you'll be glad you did.
Thanks to Emad, Robert & the J&E crew.<//Text>

These guys are great! Solid, honest folks. Over the past months they have given me advice that saved me money and potentially costed them short-term business. Drove off multiple times without handing over a cent. But they earned my loyalty in the long run.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Emad & Jason do a fantastic job with my cars every time. They are honest & helpful guys who are always available to provide assistance, no matter what kind of car I bring in. Very reasonable prices. Once, they even checked my brakes upon my request and assured me that there was no problem and didn't take a single penny from me. They often go above and beyond what is required of them and I'm completely comfortable to trust them implicitly when it comes to car maintenance.

I would highly recommend this business for your car maintenance needs.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This little shop is busy, and for good reason!

Emad had the clutch replaced in my Subaru in less than 24 hours, and for a price right in the range of everything I found in my research. When I picked up my car, we went for test drive around the block to make sure everything checked out, and Emad texted me 2 days later to make sure I was satisfied with the work.

Great, honest mechanic.<//review>

<review>You can truly trust this mechanic shop. They WON'T try to take advantage of you. Their prices are beyond fair. Emad provides excellent customer service. Even if you have to drop off your car and wait for it until the next day, trust me, it's worth the wait. You'll get quality work on your car that's guaranteed.
Being a woman, I'm glad I know that I have a place I can go where I can trust. Thanks Emad.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great group of guys.  Needed to replace a Catalytic Converter on a 2012 Hyundai Accent and asked for the manager, Emad, to find us the best possible pricing option.  Went out of his way to get us the best deal.   Got the work done in a reasonable amount of time with no upsell.  Really appreciated that.  Definitely will be my Auto Mechanic of choice while I'm in Glendale.<//text>

instantly diagnosed my issue in front of me! raised my car on the machine lift and gave me details, discussed problem and solutions,, direct quote, and a quick turn around time. im usually distrusting or worried once i take my car to the mechanic because i dont want to be taken advantage of. Here, i felt comfortable and confidence to trust them with ny car and they did an amazing job. honest service. so grateful, i will be back!<//text>

Claims there was missing equipment/damage to the uHaul truck when there was none. When I dropped off the truck, he didnt bother to look at it to even see if it was there and then later tried to steal $65 from me in additional damage charges. It is nothing more than theft. If zero stars was an option, that's what this place would get.

Updated: uHaul says they found the missing equipment there. Proven thief or incompetent.<//review>

< Review>
THANK YOU!

My SO and I had our battery die on the drive from Las Vegas to Hollywood.  After calling AAA, we only waited for about 15 minutes before a wonderful man named Jorge came to save the day.  He helped us assess our situation/test our battery, told us what he thought it might be, and told us about a place that he goes to that is cheaper than the one AAA had suggested for us.  It ended up being great, because the other shop (RPM) called shortly after we were picked up, and the guy on the phone was very rude before hanging up on me.

I'd say "long story short" before wrapping up, but it's really not a long story - friendly mechanic (thanks Emad!), fair prices, and doesn't bend you over backwards in labor (he didn't charge us a full hour of labor for less than an hour of work).  Additionally, we were back on the road again within 10 minutes of pulling up to the shop.

Can't thank them enough!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Marissa at August barbershop has been cutting my hair for about 3 years now and she always does a fantastic job.
The shop is clean, has a really cool old school vibe, and all of the barbers are friendly and professional.
They take Covid precautions seriously which I appreciated.
It isn't the cheapest place to get a haircut, but you definitely get what you pay for: a high quality haircut by professionals who know what they are doing. Try them out once and you'll never want to go anywhere else.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>They have early appointments which was a huge plus for me because I needed my son's hair cut before his class. Was really easy steps on their online website. I really appreciate their business and hair cut for my son. Thank you for taking us so early and on time. It helped us make it to his class on time as well and with a nice haircut.< /Review>< Rating>

The young lady that cut my hair last weekend, did an amazing job. I was making somewhat specific yet vague requests about how I wanted my hair to look and somehow she not only cut it exactly how I wanted it, but it looked better than I could have imagined. Honestly I think this was the best haircut I've ever had. Shout out to that young lady, I wish I remembered her name, she has the second chair though on the left when you walk in. Looking around at the other barbers cutting while there, they all looked like they really knew what they were doing. Would highly recommend this place both for quality and price.</text>

Great place to work or do homework before the haircut. Get your coffee while you wait for the haircut or have the coffee done by when you are finished getting your haircut. Shop is very welcoming with great music and space to start your day. I highly recommend it to anyone<//Review>

I originally picked August because it was close to my work. Even though I'm working from home now, I still take the 30 min drive to continue going. Love the vibe of the shop and Ruby's skill with the clippers is phenomenal.</review>

There are very few places left to get a man's haircut and shave.
This one is at the top of any list for service and personality of employees and owner.
P.S. I went to the OTHER barbershop in Redwood City and was not happy or impressed...

<date>1594423672549< /date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>After moving to the Bay Area, I struggled to find a reasonably priced, but knowledgable barbershop. Around the Stanford area, I found that many did not cut my hair right - blending was super choppy, hair was cut way shorter than I asked, style was completely off, or it took more than an hour to cut. To top it off, some places were charging 50$ for a men's hair cut, which coming from the midwest, seems like a crime.

I recently got my haircut by Marissa. She was extremely kind, super detailed, and communicated with me to make sure I was getting the right cut. I am incredibly happy with the result and feel more confident now that I have my go-to place to get my hair cut. Plus, at $35 I thought the service was fantastic.

Also, they have an adorable puppy named Moose. Make sure to give him chin scratches on your way out!< /review>< pictures>

The shop was kept very clean, and both of us had our masks on the whole time. Would highly recommend to anyone in need of a lockdown cut.</text>< pictures>

I have a long, coarse, and curly beard. Marissa did an excellent job cleaning it up after about 5 months of growth since my last beard trim. If you have a curly beard and are in the market for a new barbershop I highly recommend Marissa for a trim that will grow out well!</text>

The single best haircut I've found since I moved here. Reasonably priced (for the area), quick, top notch scores on quality-of-work, atmosphere, and friendliness. This is now the only place I'll go to when I'm in the area. Just be sure to book as far in advance as you can<//review>

I walk in every 6 months to 10 months with a vague description or complete indifference of what I want done with my shaggy hair and out of control beard. Marissa cuts and buzzes away for 20 minutes and I walk out looking like I belong in a fashion catalog out of Portland instead of looking like a homeless person.
Marissa is also very friendly, but like being in an Uber, I'm not one for small talk and she seems happy to quietly make me look good.
Cash only. Would definitely recommend.<//review>

<Review>Fun hike. Always bring a gallon of water at the least. Make sure to have a hat, there is little shade.

Sure it's close to the city, but there is no water, toilets or help that is accessable other than walking, riding, or flying in.

Do not become a local news story.< /Review></record>

READ ON FOR A CAUTIONARY ADVICE : first things first , the good : the trail offers scenic beauty and depending on your fitness level you will be at the bishop peak in about 24-30 mins , as this trail merges with the bishop peak trail. The bad : there are lot thorns on the trail so beware. The ugly : you can find shadow spots very rare as the vegetation is pretty sparse and you could expose yourself to extreme heat, so please be advised : to get a LOT of water , proper hiking shoes , bug repeallant (there are lot of bugs at the very top) and a hat. All in all its really beautiful and there are many spots which are total picture worthy and makes you wonder how beautiful and wild can mother nature get - better respect her and as always I add to my every review : please take out what you get in, let's preserve the beauty. Adding pictures , have fun and be safe y'all.</text>

<review>I recommend NOT taking/using this trailhead. Use a different trailhead such as Bishop Peak Trailhead. This trail is steep both in the foothill section and further up where you will basically start to rock climb up the side of Bishop Peak until to reach the main Bishop Peak trailhead. Only for experienced hikers and would recommend to be in decent shape if you plan on taking this trail to the summit.< /review>< pics>

<review>Pretty straight up,  strenuous trail.  Great hike from this entrance though. Probably not best trailhead for small kids but it's doable.  Took me about 40 minutes at slow comfortable pace.<//review>< Pics>

Have to jump across the fence to enter the trailhead from the parking lot.  Get prepared for climbing through huge rocks.</text>

Kyza is absolutely amazing!!!! She has completely brought me back to life not only on the outside but on the inside!
I want to personally thank her and Blonde/Blond for such a wonderful corrective experience. I have struggled with attaining a descent shade of blonde throughout the years and in one careful and meticulous session Kyza was able to correct years and years of color fails and difficulties with finding a salon that understood and delivered the look I wanted to attain. I am so happy to share this experience you all. Kyza made me feel at ease and was very reassuring the entire time by carefully explaining the process and answering questions as they came up for me. She is very kind,  professional, and a is great listener. Her keen attention to detail, quality in her work, experience in the field and overall care for your wellbeing as a client is unmatched!  Thank you again for everything. I wish I had found Kyza and Blonde/Blond years ago! I am looking forward to continue being a loyal client.
Thank you!!!!!!!< /Review></record>

Calling all "Blondes" - You MUST see Lauren here! She is incredible - kind, professional, relatable and AMAZING at all things BLONDE! I came in with many inches of gray/mousy growth, more inches of bad box dye, and leftover salon color from pre-pandemic days. After a carefully curated consultation Lauren got to work and clearly loves what she's doing. I showed her a picture of the shade I wanted and the end product was exactly that. Plus the Olaplex treatment made my hair shiny and soft from root to tip. The color correction blended beautifully with the fresh highlights and I couldn't be happier. I've never been more pleased on a first visit. So don't hesitate - get thee to the Home for Wayward Blondes :-)< /review>

There is no other salon in Los Angeles that does hair like this Blonde Blond. When I say icy blonde that’s exactly what happens and it’s magic. Not only are the results amazing, but it’s a very clean facility and up to all covid standards for sanitation and capacity which made me feel great about going.</review>

Caitlin & the Blonde Blond are the BESTTT !! I just went from a mucky dark color (self dyed) to the coolest blonde in a day and I’m so excited it looks so good. Seriously thanks. I’ve tried a LOT of hair places everywhere (Nashville/minnesota/NYC) with my curly hair and going blonde and this place is hands down the best</review>

I went from brunette to blond and I LOVE IT.
I worked along with Kyza for this and we talked about it first, we did a consult to see if my hair was healthy enough and also of what I wanted and what would look good for my skin tone. I loved how she took me step by step and explained everything and how she took care of my hair so it wouldn’t be damaged during the whole process. It was long but so worth it!!
If you’re thinking of going blonde do it with her 100% recommend her I’m so happy with the result!!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Hello,
I must say Kyza is the only person who's done my hair and her work is phenomenal shes my #1 and yes shes the best in every type of hair coloring, styling, extensions, and treatments she knows it all. I came in feeling so unhappy with how another salon ruined my hair but in short words Kyza worked a miracle with her magic brush, also being that I am pregnant i was able to rock the look she gave me for about 3 moths. Price is a bit high but I'll choose her over and over specially when you know your in great hands.

<Review>This salon is full of quality stylists!  And great music :)  I've worked with Kyza for about a year now and 100% confident in her.  I came in with some serious hair damage, and she was able to repair it AND get me back to blond hair in the meantime.  I highly recommend Blonde/Blond!<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
Kyza has been doing my hair for over a year now and to say she is amazing is an understatement. Her blonding skills are pure magic: she miraculously corrected my oddly toned, chunky highlights and transformed it a gorgeous blonde color.

Kyza's also incredibly professional and makes sure I'm happy, which I always am! I could never imagine anyone else touching my hair. And despite all the work that goes into going blonde, my hair has never been healthier (seriously) thanks to Kyza's product recommendations.

Aside from the uber talented blondetourage, the salon is super clean and quiet - even on the weekend. (It's the complete opposite of all the other salons in LA where you have to yell at the top of your lungs just to have a conversation.) Price-wise, I think Blonde/Blond is about the same as other salons, maybe a little more, but you get what you pay for and I think it's worth every penny.<//review>

<Review>I have been seeing Kyza for years and she is now the only stylist I will let touch my hair. Beyond being a genuinely kind-hearted and sweet person, she is smart as hell. She knows the science behind the hair that she does, which is why she can perfect any shade of blonde. She always takes her time to ensure that my color and extensions match-she is meticulous! For anyone looking to go blonde, I highly recommend asking for her by name. I am platinum blonde and I have never once walked out yellow (or really any other color than I directly asked for) after one of her services. She's patient and welcoming on top of skillful. This salon is lucky to have her!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

But everyday I look at my hair, I'm reminded as to why I really need to share my experience here. BEWARE of what you're getting yourself into at this salon. My hair is so beyond damaged. First, I called to make my appointment and was super excited be going here- because their Instagram really makes it look like they'll be able to give you what you want. I sent pictures of the color I wanted to achieve and the stylist said no problem. I also mentioned that I have clip in extensions that I would need matched as well. She said no problem. To make a long story short she had me in foils for 6 hours. I have no idea how they have girls sit for even longer. My hair can hardly take a brush through it now. The breakage is next level. There's actually so much breakage that I look like I have poorly layered hair now. Pictures attached below. Girls- taking your hair blonder is most of the time not a one and done appointment. I now know this. To keep your hair healthy, you have to do 2-3 appointments.

Further, in the MIDDLE of my appointment my stylist told me she didn't know if she'd be able to match my hair extensions! After she had me in foils for 3 hours, she decided to tell me that "the extensions that most girls bring are usually lighter than yours". I had shown her the extensions at the beginning of the appointment. She was very rude and I felt so uncomfortable for the rest of the appointment. I made it clear that if she couldn't match the extensions then I didn't want to continue with the color because I wear the extensions every weekend. After all this, the color is not even close to what I asked for. (Pictures below). It's yellow and poorly done. It's going to take probably close to a year to repair the damage that's been done to my hair. And for $500, I felt that I needed to share my experience at this salon so that others won't have to go through the same thing.</Review>< resp>

I took my mom here after a hugely botched job done at a previous location. I was consulted by Caitlin who was able to get her booked in the following week. I am so impressed at the color these ladies are able to pull off. Simply the best. If I didn’t have dark hair, I would go here myself. I am so impressed with the work they did for my mom and she has been ecstatic ever since.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Every blonde struggling to maintain their blonde in LA needs to come to Kyza at Blonde/Blond; she’s an expert artist — a master of her craft. After coming to LA, it took me over 3 years of trial and error with other colorists to finally serendipitously find Kyza. I will never go elsewhere. Like any master artist, Kyza’s attention to detail is impeccable; she’s a perfectionist. She listens extremely well and consistently nails it, whether it’s the initial color correction I needed from the past botched jobs of previous colorists, or getting the detailed layers of varied blonde colors that I desired. My hair is thin and Kyza was able to create a lot of dimension and make it appear thicker. Thank you Kyza!!!</review>< pics>

I have been going to Kyza many times and I cannot say enough good things about the beautiful work she does.  She always achieves the perfect icy shade of blonde and is meticulous in her work.

<review>I’ve always wanted to take my hair to a silver blond, but was afraid it would ruin the texture & condition of my hair. After researching salons in LA, I luckily came upon this absolute gem of a place. I’ve been getting my hair done here for around 2 years now, and have always been really impressed with the outcome. I get compliments almost on a daily basis about my hair- the color, how it looks so natural and shiny, etc. But the best part is that it still feels like my hair before it was ever bleached! I’ve never been happier with my hair, not to mention that I actually enjoy going to the salon because the staff always makes it feel like I’m hanging out with old friends. The atmosphere is chill and relaxed, and the women that have been working there for the past 2 years (Caitlin the owner, Brittany, Vanessa) are so knowledgeable about the dying process and are super detail oriented. I 100% recommend this place to any person that wants to become a blond, or simply become an even better blond. You will not find a better place! X<//review>< Pics>

I never write reviews, but I'm so glad I found this place, I feel like others should know about it...
I've been to so many salons in LA, trying to get that perfect shade of blonde and every time I was disappointed with the quality– either my hair was orangey or the highlights were uneven or the colorist was meh. Finally found this mecca for 'wayward blondes' and I couldn't be happier. Kyza walked me through the process of exactly how to achieve the blonde I wanted and then did exactly that. It was like magic. She evened out my old highlights with my roots and blended it to be the perfect, natural shade. Finally, after all my failed attempts, my hair was the blonde I'd been dreaming of.
I've been back several times since, and can honestly say it was not a fluke–the quality of service is consistently tops. Kyza is a true artist, not to mention a kind, considerate person that is fun to be in a conversation with for the 2 hours you're getting your hair done (which is so important). If you're looking for a smart, savvy colorist you can trust, go to to Kyza at blonde/ blond.< /text>

Hair is a very sensitive and important subject of your entire look so it's hard finding someone you trust. And let me tell you that Kyza is the only person I trust with my hair!!!!! I have dark Asian hair but wether I'm getting a touch up or fixed up, I always walk out with amazing blonde hair!</review>

Kyza understands blondes! Even if you can’t put into words exactly what you want, she is amazing at showing you options and figuring out exactly what you are looking for. I’ve been getting blonde highlights for more than ten years of my life and it looks the best it has ever looked since I started going to Kyza. So lucky i found her</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>KYZA IS A MIRACLE WORKER. I came in this morning with basically a dead ombre raccoon for hair and after a few short hours with Kyza I'm rocking Jules from HBO's Euphoria episode 1 hair. 10/10 would recommend. Also, if you're down to invest in yourself and subsequently your happiness, their pricing is MORE than reasonable! So happy I found this place and thank you Kyza!!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Kyza is amazing! My previous hair dresser could not get my hair to the blonde I wanted so I came to see Kyza and she nailed it! My hair is the shade of blonde I wanted and very healthy. She has also put in extensions for me that looked great and no damage to my hair. She gives great tips on maintenance and products.< /text>

<review>I’m not 1 to normally write reviews but I have to rave about this newfound treasure of mine! The past year I’ve had awful experiences with my hair and was about to give up on blonde until I came across this salon. I showed Kyza the shade of blonde I’d been attempting without success, and she knew exactly what to do. I was so impressed by her technique in adding the smallest amounts of hair to multiple foils which I think made such a difference. Not only is her attention to detail phenomenal, but she is an absolute gem of a person! Today I was greeted by her with a genuine hug as well as greeted with a warm welcome by the fellow stylists. I totally feel at home here and actually enjoy my time! Blonde Blond exclusively does BLONDE hair ONLY, which tells you they are 100% blonde experts! I’ve honestly never received so many compliments on my hair and it feels absolutely amazing. So if you are looking to get the perfect blonde results tailored to you and your desire, as well as exceptional customer service, look no further. I am ecstatic to say I have finally found a permanent hair home. Thank you Kyza & Blonde Blond for my incredible transformation, and making me feel beautiful!!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2bec1958167b5:0x9b5b4bfe5c6ea0b9</GmapID></record>

I used to bleach and tone all of my hair to have blonde hair and the grow out was shocking, not to mention the breakage. Now, Caitlin makes me blonde and when my hair grows out it looks so good, more natural and I don't notice any breakage. I love my hair so much and love spending time at the salon!< /Review>

Gigi saved my hair!!!!!

I have spent the last 3 months in the sun and ocean. No matter how much I tried to protect my out-grown winter white hair, the ocean fried it! No amount of product seemed to bring the straw back to life.

Enter Gigi at Blonde/Blond. Gigi, herself, has gorgeous long honey blonde hair. When I sat in her chair I expected her to tell me we would need to cut most of it off. As that morning, it truly looked beyond repair. However, she did not. She had so much confidence that she could save it!

We sat and discussed a better blonde for my olive skin and dark brown eyes. Much more golden multi-tonal shade. She also assured me that she would add protein back into damage.

While doing my hair, we chatted. Gigi is beyond hip. She is so cool and plugged into LA. Regaling me with hilarious stories of Night Life and the fabulous eccentricities found in West Hollywood.

When the process was finished. I was astonished. Not only did the new color suit my skin so much more than platinum blonde. It looked and felt like healthy hair. Amazing!!!!

I will be back to see Gigi because the whole experience was Ace! I cant stop telling anyone who will listen!</text>

Caitlin is a definite experienced artist with hair and getting you the right color blonde. Vanessa who works with her is also wonderful. They have both worked on my hair. I never though I would find anyone that could make my brunette hair the perfect blonde. You will never find better!!!</Text>

I’ve been Caitlin’s client for over 8 years!!! Nothing but perfection every time I get my hair done! It’s been a godsend considering no one knows how to correctly work with blonde color. I love Caitlin and my blonde color always looks amazing!!! Blonde blond is the best salon for blondes!<//review>

If you want to be blonde, this is the ONLY place to go.

After going to Caitlin for about 3 years now, I would never trust my hair to anyone else.  I've been blonde for most of my adult life and have tried many salons and colorists all over the country.  When I first went to Caitlin, it was because I was very unhappy with the health of my hair.  As much as I loved being blonde, I was seriously contemplating going dark because of how damaged my hair was.  Since I've been a client of Caitlin's, my hair has completely transformed...it is healthy, full and is growing again! Somehow she is able to bring my naturally dark brown hair to a beautiful, non-brassy shade of blonde while keeping my hair HEALTHY and LONG.

In addition to the amazing job she does with my hair, I always look forward to seeing her.  The time spent in the salon chair flies by and I feel like I am spending time with a dear friend.</text>

She is unbelievable. She is never working on more than 1 person at a time and pays so much attention to my hair! My hair has not only been the perfect shade of blonde but has become healthier and healthier! I am so happy and get compliments on my hair all the time.

Caitlin is the most talented and best hair stylist that I have ever been to. She specialize in blonde hair color and color correction and if you see some of the before and after photos she has online you will be amazed!!!

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Caitlin Richardson is a master blonde color specialist and does perfectly placed, natural looking extensions! Her talent is truly unreal.

Until I met Caitlin, I honestly thought my hair would just never be the shade of blonde I wanted it to be. Turns out it, my hair wasn't the issue, it was the colorist!

Besides all the other terrible colorist I've had work on my hair for years, one guy took it to another level of disaster. Knowing I am super picky about my blonde hair and had always been looking for "the best", someone referred me to a colorist who was supposedly the "best of the best celebrity colorist in Beverly Hills". Not sure who gave him his title but I left his salon with my hair looking like yellow snow!!!

After crying for hours, I couldn't stand to look at the yellow snow any longer and googled "best blonde specialist Los Angeles" and there she was! Thank god for Caitlin. She was the only one who was able to not only fix it but continue to make it even more amazing. That was almost 5 years ago and I have never turned back!

I recently moved to Dallas and still fly in to Los Angeles to get my hair done. If Caitlin moved to the moon I would just have to invest in Virgin Galactic to get my hair done by her!

In conclusion - She is a blonde and love blondes! She is a total perfectionist which is very rare. She knows color, because she is an artist, not just a colorist and she will love and take care of your hair better than you will!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Very nice, quiet & well maintained park, probably the best in the area for 55 & older folks. Very well managed. Managed by a very caring & informative wife & husband team. Pool, workout area with several new workout machines. Very nice club house, upgrading the kitchen area now. Improvements are constantly being done to upgrade the area & make it safe & enjoyable for residents. Many fun activities are constantly being planned for the enjoyment of the residents.  Holiday  celebrations, monthly dinners w/entertainment for a reasonable price, Food Truck Day once a week, the 'book mobile stops by once or twice a month, breakfasts about once a month, and other fun activities are examples of things done to interest & engage the residents. Small inside pets are allowed on approval by management.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Very good atmosphere. Employees are friendly and get to know you by name. Equipment is maintained in order and clean. The heated pool is always a nice touch and the classes offered are friendly enough for beginners while not letting down the more advanced members. Great little gym.<//Review>< pictures>

Prefer this one compared to the other ones, older machines but they all work the same. Staff is fine with me as long as they let me in when I give them my member numbers. You have to figure out what times that are not the busiest which is a con. I hope they expand the gyms. Those big ass fans are cool and circulate quite a bit. Other than that it's a great gym overall.<//review>

<Review>Daniel G Hughes says, we have been going to this gym since 2001. Enjoyed the many years working out and going to the pool with my kids. Health and Fitness is my priority. There's about five gyms with another one opening soon all in Fresno and Clovis. Each one keeps getting better and better.</Review><userid>111334166429630843164< /userid>< Date>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Bad environment for women.  The men/boys who work out here are a bunch of dogs and they don't even try to hide it.  I've been wearing the same workout shirt for 3 years and never had a problem at my 24 hour fitness gym in Hollywood.   Here these guys do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING they can to stare down your shirt.  They walk past with their eyes down to see my cleavage or stand waiting for me to bend over so they can look down my shirt.  It's disgusting.  I never even knew my shirt showed anything but arms until I came to this gym.  These boys (I won't even say men because real men know not to do that crap) are so obvious and everyone in the gym can see what they are doing but I get the feeling it's considered "normal".  GB could do something to the environment to make it more centered on respecting women, there's business research out there that gives this information.  But GB doesn't seem to care about that. It's probably owned by some pig who gets a kick out of disrespecting women himself.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>It's one of the better gyms in town, but they don't have equipment that is good for advanced or elite athletes.  No glute-ham, no reverse hypers, no monolift, the bars are bent out of shape, and the swimming pool is freezing.  But, the gyms in Fresno just aren't up to the standards in most cities.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I am reviewing this agian on 2/5/2018. They build new gb3 and it's beautiful place to go. Maybe above incidence happened once but no more. New GB3,, good coustomer service,  no health safety risk, new equipment, it's like going to new energetic place. Too many improvements.<//review>< gmapID>

Truth is, I've given this location several chances, the staff is nice enough and its in jogging distance of my apartment , however the whole decore and gym set up just makes me feel like I've stepped into a garish 80's work out video, complete with gaudy colorful everything... And old equipment makes it hard for one to enjoy themselves .< /text>

My local gym where I come to work out but when I hop in the pool to do some lap swim, all the lanes are gone and there are close to a dozen kids playing around with a few parents in the water. I don't mind open swim and since there isn't a pool for these kids, I really don't mind but if I have to spend my whole time dodging then inform the front desk that they may want to put in a lane for other patrons. But am told to go to another location. Politely however still a go somewhere else. Alittle annoyed with it and wish policy changes so their answer can be ok sir, we will go add a lane now and not go try any other gym location.< /review>

I'm visiting from Texas and needed a gym for three days. I saw the bad scores in Google for reviews here, but had no good alternatives. I showed up, paid ten bucks for a day pass, and used the elliptical machines.

Things I thought were cool: signs hanging from the ceiling telling you how the weight machines are laid out; iPod/iPhone docs (pre-iPhone 5 jack), USB and headphone ports; Individual tv screens; free wi-fi.

No towel service though.

I rate it four stars, but I'm giving it 5 to overcome those unfair reviews.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They overcharge you as adding a extra soda you didn't even have  it's not the first time they do that. 3rd time and I decide to say something,and she quickly apologized. People make sure you pay for what you bought. Do the math before paying with your Visa.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Great selections and hard to beat their prices for fresh meat and also produce. They're located on Main St. Their parking is kinda janky so just be careful! They also have a resturant attached facing main and it taste really good and authentic or as well as super affordable. Once again, prices are hard to beat.</Text>< gmap_id>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I always take out loans with oportun, I think it is fast, safe and easy. I don’t normally write reviews but I felt like I had to. The  first time I applied to oportun the lady who was helping me was very rude, I just let her be and towards the end she started acting nice and told me to rate them 5 stars. This is the second time I come to oportun in this location and this time I came with my mom. The same lady (Karen) was helping us. I asked her a question and she corrected me, she didn’t even let me finish explaining, she just interrupted me. We came in 20 mins before closing. We were waiting for our call and right  before 6 we were done and she said she couldn't help us anymore to come back tomorrow. My mom left the store unsatisfied and i left the store upset. I don’t think I will be comfortable taking another loan out from that location. I will not be coming If I need another loan. I had a bad experience twice so I’ll  just look somewhere else.< /text>< Pics>
