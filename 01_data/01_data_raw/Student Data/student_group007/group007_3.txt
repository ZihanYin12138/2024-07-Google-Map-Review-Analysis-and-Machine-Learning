Exactly what you would expect in a poke bo. Nothing super amazing but good. The staff wasn't overly nice but not rude. The fish tasted fresh and lots of options. I will go back but it won't be my favorite spot. The bathroom definitely needs to be cleaned.< /text>

Love it. I come just for the help noodles and grilled salmon bowl. All toppings are fresh and delish. First time I've gotten the Macarons ice cream sandwiches. Will get again.<//text>

I ordered from DoorDash, and the food came in the BEST delivery packaging I've ever seen, hands-down. My toppings were kept cool on a bed of ice, and my rice was steamy warm. Not to mention the food tasted AMAZING 🙌 definitely coming back to this place!< /review>

Now this is what I call a poke bowl 👏👏👏 I've tried many poke spots around town and most are flavorless, bland, and priced too high for what the quality of ingredients they use.

Great food. Found this place door dashing and wanted to try it out. Would have given five stars but after we told the young lady behind the counter that it was our first time, she wasn’t very helpful and did not explain the food options at all. We had to keep asking what all of the different food options were. Also we asked for passion fruit juice at least four times and she still gave us guava juice. The guava was great though.</Text>

The kelp noodles are great.  Always fresh and great choices. More options than most poke places. I will always make a special trip for this place.</review>

We have been eating here since they opened.  There's a couple poke places closer to our house but this place is much better so we make the drive.

Our last visit was a bit disappointing as the girl behind the counter was not at all friendly and was rushing to the point of making mistakes.  There was no need to rush as there was no line behind us.

The second issue is related to COVID limited seating.  I get that they need to block off seating for compliance but they do it in a terrible way.  First, they should block off the seat closest to the line.  They also should spread out the seating throughout the entire restaurant instead of cramming everyone into the closest area near the counter.

These deficiencies weren't enough to keep me from returning but simply observations for them to improve.<//Text>

This place will deny you service if you are not wearing a mask. They will not provide you one either. So if you came and forgot your mask, they will rather loose your $40 order then spending $2 on a mask. 🙄
They are extremely rude as well.< /Text>

This place is awesome. The fish is good quality and so are all of the other ingredients. Great food made the way you ask for it, and you get to choose your own adventure so to speak. Lots of different options for fish and many different options for toppings. Awesome experience. Will be back.<//text>

<time>1565559116215<//time><Rate>4<//Rate><text>This place is like a Subway for sushi topped bowls.  You pick brown or white rice and then pick your toppings.  You can pick 2 or 3 toppings sushi type toppings base in the size you pay for.  You can add on as many other toppings like seaweed, thin sliced ginger, etc as you like.  I really liked the combination I selected.  All the toppings tasted good and liked that I was able to pick them as I wanted.

This place is great if you like sushi.  Most of the toppings have raw fish in them so not a place for people that don't like raw fish though.  They do offer a chicken teriyaki chicken bowl for those that really just don't like raw fish but that is pretty much the only option if for non-sushi eaters.

The staff was friendly and very helpful helping us with recommendations when we asked for their favorites.

The interior was clean and very comfortable.  Tables were spaced out nicely so did not feel crowded.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809b1fd761ff0163:0xa94955a7335c03e1</gmapID></record>

< Review>
Coming from the lake, we stopped by to get food and since we didn’t have masks we used shirts as face coverings. The employee was rude the moment we walked in and denied service because we are “suppose to wear face masks not face coverings”. She walked off ignoring us, how unprofessional!<//Review>

When my family and I got there, there was only one employee working and there was a long line. They did bring out a couple more employees and the line started moving quickly. I like their selections compared to other Poki places in the area. They have a decent selection of most things. Their prices are comparable or better than the others also. I always enjoy their food. I will definitely go back there again.</text>

<text>I love the food when they don't run out! I have been 8 times and 4 times they are out of "Tuna Luau" or "Blazing Salmon" their 2 specialties. The employees then say "it's late in the day and we ran out"...it was 6pm on a Friday night. We went there saying, "let's go there before they go out of business", because there are never many people there.
We're done...no more.<//text><rating>1<//rating>< Date>

<username>Ernest Cook</username><text>Another place where you walk thru cafeteria style to  make your own recipe of what might taste good in a bowl. This one focuses on raw fish, and other items found in a Japanese specialty market. They serve fairly small portions (think tablespoons of meat) over a bed of rice.

I suggest they use their expertise to build out a couple of bowls that people can order when they aren’t familiar with the ingredients.</text>< resp>

<review>Very unprofessional!! I got food poisoning from this place. Called in to politely inform them what was going on and I was told the main manager was not in but they would be more than happy to pass along my number to them. It has been 4 days and I still have not received a call!!! I am very unsatisfied with their customer service. This place not only made me sick and have to leave work but they didn't even bother to follow up. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

We love AhiPoki! They have a large selection to choose from. They have a good drink selection from bottled drinks, fountain and specialty drinks. The dining area is pretty big you never feel like you are sitting right on top of strangers. Every time we have been there the fiid prep area and dining room are clean. They do have some busy times, if it is busy,  the line can get to the door pretty quickly.  The music is never to loud, you can have a conversation without yelling to the person across from you.

Today was the first time we ordered an Macaron icecream sandwich.  My daughter loved it. They had a great selection.</review>

I was sorely disappointed by this place on a Friday at 4:00. They had no edamame, no seaweed salad, old cucumber and barely any sprouts. They don’t even carry unagi sauce. Apologies aren’t enough when you come desiring the seaweed salad and they’re out. It’s like saying, “Oops, we ran out of rice and beans” at Chipotle. Unacceptable. There are so many other places that have better and fresher items that are actually in stock. Not coming back.</Review>

< Review>
Do not waste your time or money. If you have ever been to Delilah's market or Make Fish, you will be extremely disappointed.
I ordered a Ahirrito and was very dissatisfied with the amount of food get for for your money. For $9.50 before taxes, you get a poke burrito that has two scoops of poke, and five scoops of toppings. Sounds like a good amount until you see the tea spoon size scoopers used and that they scrape off the top of the scooper to level/lessen the amount you get in the burrito. They also took a long time to actually role the burrito after all of the options were picked. I waited over 10 minutes after paying for the burrito before it was finally rolled and given to me. Three other people had ordered poke bowls, paid, and sat down to eat before my burrito was completed and I paid before them.  Do not waste your time or money.</Review>

Raw 🎏, but upon request the chef will cook it for you. Extra charge for avacado. 'Scoops' mean spoon-full-of meat/tofu. To get  your 💰 s  worth get everything in your bowl, otherwise it looks like an empty bowl with white rice and u feel ripped off.

There's an area for a patio with no tables or chairs, so if u want to eat outside with your pet, u have to cross the street to eat at Chipotle.

They don't label their food. I'd like to know if the fish is farm raised, wild caught, sustainable, and where it came from. Even if it was something simple like Rubio's menu description.<//review>

Thank you El Cajon Animal Control. We were able to to reunite with our family dog that ran away but was found and brought to the shelter. When we got him back we could tell he was cared for lovingly. they examined him and took all the precautionary measures to ensure that he would be safe. Every penny was worth paying for and reasonable. If you have lost your pet and is at the shelter be prepared to take your ID a picture of your pets and money.<//review>

Adoption process is overly complicated, people are litterally walking away from this shelter empty handed because of the unnecessary hoops they have to jump through to give a cute animal a home. And to add to that you can’t see the animal until you pay out money and you come to pick him/her up. They also offer a “return policy” for adopted pets and with that being said I think it’s safe to say that they run this shelter like it’s a sketchy used car dealership and the animals are the product being sold.<//review>
<Response>{'time': 1614814634258, 'text': 'Miki, Thank you so much for considering adopting a pet. Due to COVID-19, we temporarily adjusted some of our services, including adoptions, which are now by appointment only. These changes were made to protect the health and well-being of animals in our care, our staff, volunteers and the community we serve.\n\nInformation about our adoption process can be found here: https://www.sdhumane.org/adopt/adoption-process/. While adoptions are currently by appointment only, you can see our available pets here:\nhttps://www.sdhumane.org/adopt/available-pets/.\n\nWe implemented an “Adoption Guarantee” because we know not every adoption goes the way we hope. We want our adopters to know, with no judgment, we’ll take that pet back and refund the fee. For us, and our animals, that adventure outside of the shelter was priceless—we’re able to learn so much more about them by what the family observed in their home, and the pet had a much-deserved adventure outside the shelter!\n\nWe hope we can help you find your new family member soon. If we can answer any additional questions, please email info@sdhumane.org or call 619-299-7012. Thank you!'}<//Response></record>

There comes a time when you have to do the inevitable and say good bye to your dearly loved pets.
It is VERY devastating to see them suffer due to old age complications and seeing their quality of life is diminished.

SPCA of El Cajon's staff were very helpful, campationate and sensitive to our needs in this difficult time.

Regardless of the negative ratings on the El Cajon Animal Shelter this facility runs on contributions and donations. I have adopted 2 animals from here, and NOT ONCE have I had negative assistance. It is because of this local facilities that animals are saved and protected.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM GO PAY THE EXORBIDANT ADOPTION FEES AT HELEN WOODWARD AND IF PERHAPS YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.</Review>

I just dont see the point of not allowing people to view the animals. They have this bs rule about not wanting to get the pets sick with covid or vice versa but that's obviously ludicrous(because there are sooooo many pets infecting humans with the coronavirus).< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Some of the reviews on this place are comical.  You can't take your dog to a kill shelter because it's out of control and expect them to rehabilitate it, or not euthanize it after the prescribed amount of time.  You can't expect it to be a pet hotel.  If your animal escapes, is not chipped, and is brought to this shelter, it will be labeled a stray and subject to all the same requirements as any other random animal that is brought in.  That means if it bites someone, it may get euthanized.  I understand this is upsetting, but these are just the facts of life.

That said, this has been the shelter from which my family adopted almost all of our pets when I was growing up.  I've been coming here since I was a little kid, selecting dogs and cats as needed for our rural property.  I've got some amazing pets from this shelter over the years.  It's my go-to shelter when I'm ready to have a pet.  I just recently lost the mini poodle mix I adopted from this shelter almost 13 years ago, and she was absolutely the best dog.</Text>< pics>

My son an I went in a week ago to look at cats, he found one he liked but it wasn't going to be available for adoption until the following week. We were told we were first on the list and we made an appointment to adopt him when he was available. We go in on the day and time our appointment was for only to find out that they already adopted him out. They had no documentation that we were first on the list and tried to argue with me about the information I received. They didn't seem to care too much.

They clearly have NO ORGANIZATION and their front desk is run by a staff that has no idea what they are doing. No one wanted to take responsibility for this mishap, they kept blaming people that weren't there to defend themselves. My son and I went home disappointed and without a cat.

I'm all for adopt don't shop, but if you choose to adopt here make sure they have all their sh*t together and contact them like crazy to make sure they have all of the correct information.</Text>

They are SUPER rude and disrespectful. The worse thing is when you need help and then you try and talk to them and they start giving you attitude. It is your JOB to help me when needed, you are getting PAYED to work here and help people when they need it. I would rather die than recommend this place to anyone. My kid saw this adorable cat and he asked the lady if it’s okay to see him and she literally started being rude to a 7 year old, like what the hell. My kid stormed out of the place and got inside the car crying to his father saying, “She was so rude, I wanted a cat and she yelled at me for no reason”. You guys are not professionals and you guys are far more disrespectful than I thought people at an animal shelter can be.<//review>

<review>Courtney was extremely rude. She had been helping me kept putting me on hold without telling me then coming back to the phone and saying “what do you need what do you need me to do for you there’s a lot going on here what is it that you need from me” with such a horrible tone. I repeated myself to her about my issue and she then transfers me to SDPD dispatch. WITHOUT TELLING ME! They had no idea why I wasn’t calling them for this matter.

It wasn't the Hilton for animals but clean enough and the staff were friendly and accommodating.  To the majority of the people complaining,  please realize that these staff are doing a pretty good job while overworked and underpaid. They deal with people constantly wanting to adopt dogs that aren't good fits for certain homes and then end up returning the dog to the pound.  Be realistic. If you live in an apartment, don't try and adopt a 100lb dog. And if you have other dogs in the home,  ALWAYS bring them for a meet and greet with your potential dog. Staff has attitude for a reason. Too many people adopting out of emotion and not logic so they have to play police a lot because people are dumb.< /Review>< pictures>

They adopted out my dog of 4 years within days of being stolen and turned in outside of our jurisdiction.  Even though we correctly identified him, they would not work with is at all and were beyond disrespectful. A lack of a microchip DOES NOT relinquish my rights to my own dog. They are unprofessional, unethical, and care more about the money in turnover than pets' well being.</text>

<Review>We adopted our puppy (a 1 year old mutt) in June 2017. She's sweet & happy & a blessing!
I agree there isn't a lot of help. There was one awesome "Everything" lady. She was the only one helping 4 families meet & visit pets. I wish I could remember her name. She was working as quickly as able and didnt make us feel rushed when it was our turn.
We love our pup & will start there if we decide to adopt again.<//Review>< pics>

This was the first result that popped up on google for animal shelters in El Cajon  and I called in a panic looking for two pit bulls that escaped. Initially,  The receptionist was very helpful but my dogs were not there there.  I then called other shelters and one was under ACES Foundation when I called it was in fact  the El Cajon animal control. She was very rude the second time saying, “yeah you just called” and I said you’re number is listed twice under a different name and she responded “ we’re really not” and hung up. Very rude and  unnecessary. It’s a wonder this place has such low ratings!<//Text>

These people are committed, tireless and work against all odds. Try working there day after day and get a true sense of what they deal with daily, including customers who need to think more about the animals and less about their delicate customer service needs. Seriously, walk a mile in their shoes. I honestly think you will change your mind quickly.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>I’ve adopted four dogs from here. Was not informed on ANY of their behaviorial issues (aggression towards humans and dogs, resource guarding etc) the most recent dog we adopted we had to return sadly. We were told he was a GSD mix but we had found out he was a Belgian Malinois mix(big difference between the breeds). We took him back and gave them all the  information we got while the dog was in our care. When we went back to check on the dog we were informed that he was adopted back out and none of the information that we gave them was taken into consideration. We had highlighted some  important things about this dog that the next owner should’ve known about but the lady with the red hair had told us that what we wrote doesn’t matter and was not passed to the new owner of this dog. I’m sorry but this place is poorly ran and the staff barely have any knowledge on dog behavior, dog training, or dog breeds in general I saw multiple miss labeled breeds. The outside of the facility is nice though< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I feel bad for the animals here. There is no AC for the dogs and it can get hot in El Cajon in the summer. The adoption prices are cheap here compared to other Humane Societies in San Diego County. They are also closed on Mondays.</text>

Cats are kept in a warm area and if you think its cold read the sign of the door "Keep door closed".. so... Dogs are in open but DO IN FACT have heated floors. I have donated $40 worth of toys and i know they need more so donate. I HIGHLY recomend this shelter, i have brought home 2 dogs: a puppy and a elderly dog. Please do not complain about their prices- it includes all the shots that cost more than the actual animal. Be thankful please. When or if you go there here is what you will see: Behind the shelter is a firemen practice area. 3 rows of dogs, at the end a dog run. Right at the beginning, is a cat door, please close it after you! They have a large back part to hold un able to adopt pets- do not try to go back there. They 2 or 3 areas you can play with the dogs if you are interested in adopting. DO NOT go there to rant or be rude to them. They are very nice and DO NOT open dog doors and do NOT try to pet animals. DO NOT open cat doors, are do not try to even pet cats- they bite and scratch. Please do not be rude. Thank you would be nice.< /review>< pics>

Well you as a shelter certainly have your trials from theses comments yet. I wanted to let you know if you are still there. I was wanting to give money to San Diego Animal Shelter on Gaines Ave to save animals and not out then done they wouldn't guarantee it</Text>

The most depressing shelter I've ever been to. I cried when I left! The poor animals are not treated well at all. The facilities, cages, rooms, and litter boxes are a mess. The animals are not kept in good conditions (not enough padding, sitting directly on the wire cages, no AC, filthy) and the workers there don't even seem to care or give the pets any attention. It's so sad! Actually....please GO here and adopt a pet. Get them out!< /Review>

I literally made an account JUST TO RATE THEM 1 STAR. I wish I could give them less.
I'm an extreme animal lover and have never had a bad experience at a shelter until here. One woman cleaning out the kennels was so RUDE and sarcastic. She just seemed like such a miserable person. The animals seemed hot and miserable. What kind of shelter doesn't help people that are trying to adopt a dog.</text>

I visited this shelter with a dog we found wondering on the side of a busy street and the lady at the front desk was zero help, rude, and the place was a mess.  I would not place a dog there for any reason and we ended up taking the dog home.  I highly doubt they will be of any assistance in finding this poor animal's owner.  I highly doubt they care for the dogs in their shelter.  If you need to give up your dog, please take it to a different shelter in another city.  I complained to the supervisor of this shelter to no avail.<//review>

I took my cat here to put her up for adoption because certain circumstances made it so I could no longer keep her. Not only did she somehow escape from this dreadful excuse of a *Shelter*. She found her way home to me and when she got home she was pregnant. I felt terrible in the first place about having to give up my baby, then these people let her escape and get pregnant. Absolutely terrible place. They need to be shut down.< /review>

I went there about a week ago to adopt a new dog. I get there and got a 4 yr old male chihuahua. I got him home he showed signs of needing to go potty. I took him outside to use the bathroom and waited all most an hour for him to go potty. He didn't go we go back inside not even 5 mins he use the bathroom inside on my floor. How can they their house broken when clearly they are not. Why can't they be honest at the shelter. Turns out he doesn't even respond to his name which is very weird. He does not even know any commands.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely unprofessional, went in to adopt a dog and was told to come back the next day and was first on the list. Upon arriving the next day, a lady came out and told us we could not have it because we didnt have a big yard, after being told the day before it wouldnt be an issue. She was short and didnt even give us time to say a word before turning her back and walking away. So they would rather leave their dogs in cages then give them a loving home.

I have worked with and trained dogs most of my adult life. I have even been a k9 handler for over 10 years with usar... the staff is rude and in my opinion should not be near animals since the do appear to have the temperament for this kind of work.... the animals are in ok condition but they could be in so much better condition being taken care of by anyone who cares. I will never recommend  this place to anyone and I believe aspca should come and take over this place<//Review>< pictures>

The woman at the front desk who waited on me was sweet and kind. I was so upset as my dog ran away over a week ago.  My dog wasnt there but her positivity was contagious. I walked into the place in tears and left feeling encouraged.</text>

<Time>1406847238399< /Time><rating>1</rating><Text>Awful service, awful surroundings, and rude people. We walked in hoping to adopt a larger dog even though we live in an apartment. Now I knew we would probably get questioned about it but I still expected they'd at least hear us out and let us explain at least that we still had plenty of space to keep a large dog happy. Call me naive I guess. So still under the pretense I could get a large dog we went to look at the kennels well here is surprise number one. Awful living conditions. I mean this was appalling.  I felt so awful for the poor dogs and came across this 8 year old german shepherd. When I went to ask if we could see him they immediately told us no as we lived in an apartment and that'd be unfair to the dog so we go and look at this other dog that is smaller. Medium sized and 3 years old. They again tell us no as it'll grow. Okay at 3? It's medium and will remain medium but they apparently felt we should only have a small dog even though I wanted a guard dog. We left and came across the Chula Vista Animal Facility. They were so sweet. They let us explain that my husband is deploying and I want a guard dog. We were led to the kennels that were so much nicer and were allowed to socialize with an adorable 1 year old German Shepherd. We adopted him with no trouble. They explained how to live in an apartment with a large dog and were very helpful. And they charge less than El Cajon too! I'd recommend forget El Cajon and go to Chula Vista as El Cajon is prejudiced against anyone that doesn't own their own house. Catch that I said OWN. Not rent. The only good thing I found at El Cajon was the directions to Chula Vista. Thank you Chula Vista for caring for it's dogs and customers!<//Text>< gmapID>

<Text>I was pretty upset when I visited this Friday, I purchased an AKC registered AMSTAFF puppy and I want to be a good owner, so I figure while she is young I should get her a playmate so I don't have to worry about under socializing her to dogs.   I was told that I couldn't adopt a small to a medium size dog from them because I have a "Staffy" and they were bred for one thing "fighting" they suggested I get another puppy of the same breed or build to be able to with stand my puppy's likely urge to shake things....

I would assume with the majority of their dogs being of bully decent they would try to encourage people to fall in love with these dogs. I have owned PitBulls and on my 2nd AMSTAFF my last one was very lovable and was great with other animals.. to include my cats... and friends small dogs... and even better with children.  I do not intend on going back to this shelter because of their breed biases.  It is very unfair to a breed!< /Text>< date>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Come on, you can communicate with the city down town, three complaints is all it takes and thier asked for ?ing. Most of anything they are there for the animals not people. If you have a challenge with the system try volunteer and see how easy it is.
Its not arrogant people you meet, it's those employee's who go through a lot of pain you and i dont see. Bad service hardly if you work there you would know, " SORRY".
Im just saying thanx Sportdog :)< /text>< pics>

<Review>I purchased some items including a puzzle. I started with putting together the frame of the puzzle and found a couple of pieces missing. I went through each individual piece twice to see if I missed them somehow. I didn’t. Then asked my husband to do the same. Couldn’t find the missing puzzle pieces. We don’t have kids that could have taken off with them... so I reached out to the company and they asked for pics. I sent pics and because the puzzle is unfinished, they refuse to replace saying the pieces are likely among the others. I explained that I’m a 1000% sure they aren’t. They won’t replace the puzzle until it’s finished but what’s the point??? I’m not going to complete a puzzle that I know has missing pieces and prove it to them just to get a replacement. I don’t do puzzles more than once. I’ll never buy from here again.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I purchased these books for my own little hip-hop fan. He is only 1 year old, but I was so excited to buy these. In fact, I cannot wait to share these books with other friends and their kiddos. I know they will love it also.  Going to make this a go to gift!! Also, I did contact customer service and they were very helpful in resolving my issue.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWNJ-2nkjFYwh38xSEFNAvyH6iohXTyIEQ3WSS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1529597508965, 'text': 'We appreciate the great feedback, Brandy!

<user_id>103162735427821350844</user_id><review>It has almost been a month and I have yet to receive my order. I have contacted the company multiple times. And finally after fighting a complaint on Facebook I heard back from them with a tracking number. The only thing is the tracking number shows the package is still with them and hasn’t made it to the post office yet. It has shown this for 4 days now. Also the phone numbers on Facebook in is no longer connected and the one on there website is not a valid number. This has been a horrible experience. And I am not the only one that has had this happen too. Extremely disappointed and the said part is I had planned on purchasing a bunch more of there books had things gone well. I do not recommend that anyone purchases from this company. They are a scam!!!<//review>< Pictures>

Came here for a book reading and signing and it was well laid out and left a lot of room for questions in the timing. Pricing was on par with other places and the staff were nice.< /Text>

My godson (and his parents) loved the ABC to Jay-Z and 123 Biggie and Me books!The quality is great. The cartoon work is engaging. And the books keep the interest of both the big and little homies. I'm definitely godmom of the year!</Text>

I went looking for a post op faja & I was blown away by Rosy’s selection. She has hands down the best customer service skills & truly cares about your experience. I highly recommend this place in comparison to all the other faja places in the IE! I will be telling everyone about this place.< /Review>

<Review>Its decent. To be honest, if you are a big girl you are better off shopping at ross for shapers. Much more comfy. I speak from experience.  I purchased a shaper for my wedding  ,paid 100 and couldn't use it. I bought a ross shaper and wore it under my dress....so comfy and it did its thing!</Review>< Pictures>

I went in to find a faja since I just had lipo done a week ago. Rosy greeted my husband and I and was beyond helpful. She knew exactly what I needed and even helped me put it on! Will definitely be coming back for my next faja!< /Text>

Great prices!

This place is great! They helped me with my faja, going in there I had no idea what I was doing and they took their time to explain and show me different fajas! The place is so nice and clean and very organized! And they have variety of things as well.. I took my faja to my nurse to make sure I had gotten the correct one and she was amazed on how good the quality was and was surprised! I most definitely recommend this place as a go to!< /Review>

Best experience ever. I came in from class and I was treated like royalty. The customer service in this place is extraordinary. I was helped by a gentleman and he patiently sized me and answered my many questions about my needs. Finally he found me exactly what I was looking for. I cannot wait to return. This is an investment in your beauty and health. I wish I would of known about this store after my c section. They carry a post-surgery line.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>I would like to take the time out of my morning to let everyone out there in the world know that this location is an amazing place to go for men and women who need shapewear to help with contouring their bodies and feeling A million times better about themselves. The owner was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable, he knew exactly what size shapewear my wife needed just by looking at her. He took the time to put pads over certain areas of the garments to protect my wife from other people who have tried on these products previously and he was extremely helpful and kind to my children as well. I will be having surgery next month and I will absolutely, most definitely be returning to purchase shapewear for myself and more than likely, for my wife again LOL. Thank you so much for your wealth of knowledge and amazing customer service. my wife and I thank you very much.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c34d2562e33695:0xbc2e670faa03f182</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Mrs. Rosy is very kind and very patient and gives a lot of information when one is not very sure of what she wants or needs, I already bought three strips with her and I go for the fourth one. Their prices are very good if you compare with those around. I highly recommend Rosys shapewear. I'm sure you will not be sorry. Tell him that I, Sylvia, recommends you. May God take care of us and have an excellent day.

The tortas Ahogadas are really good here. I went for the first time before going to a Maná concert. I had the torta, which came with a taco. The sauce is not too hot, but still good. It is served in a plastic basket with a plastic bag over it. Not the first I've seen served this way. Maybe this is the traditional way?

I also had jericaya, the traditional desert from Guadalajara. The Jericaya was great! The best I tasted so far around this area (San Jose).

The only downside I can think of is the price. I thought it was a bit pricey. Is it worth the price? Hmmm tough to say in my books, thus the reason I only gave it 4 ⭐.</Review>

The tortas ahogadas are deliciosas! It can't get more authentic Mexican than that! The lonche tortas were equally bomb.   The tortas had a freshly-made look and taste.  The outside patio is spacious and festively decorated with multi- colored umbrellas and "papel picado!" There are also lots of TVs for game watching as well.  Definitely, becoming a SJ favorite. Don't miss this tortareria! ¡Provecho!🌯<//Review>

There is a reason that this place has such a high rating.  While the location is unassuming, it is also clean and nicely decorated with a large outdoor patio area.  Their beer is fantastic.  I love how they serve the beers in a 5oz, most for $3.  A flight of 4, 4oz beers is usually $12-$15 most places.</review>

Good beers! Wish they had more porter options. Their Cocoa Milk Stout is really good though.< /Review>

They uniquely specialize in sours, but they have all the regular IPAs and lagers too. Located in a industrial warehouse but they have done a nice job creating a fun space to hangout and sip delicious brews. Try the funkadelic and the bourbon-aged stout.</Review>< user_id>

<time>1464151270486<//time><rate>5< /rate><Text>I was referred to Dionysis Brewing from a guy at Temblor Brewing after expressing my interest in sour ales. I tried calling several times on Monday (8:30ish) to see if they could fill 2 growlers of sour ale. They close at 9pm. It's about 10 miles from my house and I couldn't reach them by phone. I decided to drive there anyway figuring that A) they would be open when I got there and B) that they had sour ale in stock. I arrived and learned from the bartender that I couldn't get the growlers filled with sour ale because I wasn't a member. I spoke with Kyle (co-owner) and he filled the growlers and informed me that they actually have a sour ale on tap that non-members can purchase at all times. He also filled one of the growlers with a 'member only' sour ale as a courtesy. All is well that ends well, the beer is excellent. It's really hard to find sour ales on tap so I'm stoked. Cheers and thanks!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I worked with these guys on a recent DIY front yard project that required 2 cubic yards of decomposed granite and they were FANTASTIC. Prices were the same or better than others, and SWB&S had more delivery options and could accommodate the access challenges in my urban North Park neighborhood. Everyone I spoke with, from asking questions to placing the order to the delivery people — everyone was friendly, courteous and provided top-notch service. This will be my go-to source for future projects.</Review>

<Review>This is the best customer service if you want to dig for your stones. They are kind, helpful, and most importantly they let you look for want you need and then take it to your car. It’s a small location but of all locations most accommodating.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dc004ba57f1e63:0x7279caf8514005bb</gmap_id>< rating>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I own a landscape design and contracting firm and I have to say that the people at this company are incredible. As a female in this business, I've found it can be a very unfriendly business and your team at the Pacific Beach location has always made me feel so welcome.  James, Illusion, and Shauna are an incredible team at the front, and Matt and Lalo have been the most killer yard crew I have worked with.  I have to write a special shout out to James. I am going to miss this kid at the front so much!  There is nothing better than coming into your PB Store during a stressful day and James has a huge smile on his face.  I have worked with James for years and you can tell that he genuinely cares about people and making customers happy.  Talk about going above and beyond, any time I call, I get a call back from James once things have calmed down to see what I need.  I have never encountered service like this.  I honestly will say, I really have never met anyone in my field as nice as James and the rest of your team in PB.  Illusions leadership and sense of humor are contagious.  Shauna you are the sweetest and calmest person I know, and I know how crazy it gets in there!  Matt, you always seemed to have eyes in the back of your head and knew what what was going on and needed to be done, a contractors dream!   Lalo, always hustling out there!  Your team, their chemistry and work ethic have made Southwest my #1 pick since I started my business.  I can't recommend this team enough.  I hope y'all carry on the legacy.</review></record>

The staff at this location have excellent customer service!
Each interaction (phone calls & in-person) was pleasant and with the kind of people I like to do business with.  There was even a mixup on my purchase- when I arrived home I realized they loaded the incorrect size of stones purchased.  Although it did cause inconvenience for me, the staff politely made it right with a great sense of urgency & care.  They completely fixed the problem & my inconvenience - Shawna, Tiana, manager Mike, and others were super friendly & helpful.  I'll definitely go back to this location for future project needs!!</Review>

<text>Unexpectedly helpful, friendly, and efficient.  I called Southwest after having a hard time trying to buy just a small amount of travertine coping and pavers at another materials supplier.  Shawna answered my questions right away, and helped me find samples and then placed the order for me.  If you are a home owner needing materials for a small job, or a large job, this is the place to go!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I love this place!  I've been to this location several times and always get great, friendly service but this weekend topped the others. I decided to install some synthetic turf in my back yard and do it myself. I've had a couple material deliveries from Southwest (delivered the day and time promised) and on Saturday I was finalizing the top layer of decomposed granite before laying the turf.
Well, I realized I was about two yards short and headed to SW Boulder. My truck can handle 1/2 yard at-a-time, so I was hurrying. They were quick and efficient each time but my last trip was going to have me arrive a couple minutes after closing.
I called to see if they could help and the manager, Christian, said "come on down and I'll help you out".  I was so stoked to have that kind of service in today's world.
With the new world of Amazon instant delivery and so many stores closing, I want to make sure we'll run, customer oriented businesses like Southwest remain open.
This place is the top of my recommendation list.< /text>

I strongly disagree with MC. I use Southwest pretty often, and I am always impressed. They have very good customer service and an amazing selection. Make sure you go up to their big yard in Rainbow if you want to see all of your choices, though. The PB yard is just a small selection of what they can get for you. I love picking boulders from them because they have about 20 different kinds, way more than anyone else, and they let you climb all over the piles and pick any specific boulder you want. They also have a big display garden area with a huge pond, worth seeing. You'll get some good ideas to take home with you from it. These guys function like a family owned business (which I think they are) and really go the extra mile.<//text>

Dont know if this place is under new management since re-opening the PB location but quality of service has gone way down since the re opening. Went there today and the sold me 300 lbs of crushed granite when I got home it felt light and small so I weighed it 240 lbs. When I called to see if I could pick up remaking 60 lbs they told me they sell by volume....  I've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. And they would rather lose a customer than fill up a 60 lb bag of material. Their never getting my business again!< /Review>

<text>We have used them for many projects and they are very close to where we live.

I don't mind paying a little more to not have to drive for an hour or two.

The products they have (and can get you) are nice.

Only interested in maximum profit, no real care to home customers.  Lousy attitude from the yard workers to the counter staff.  I need 1 ton of flagstone, and chose the $800/ton Autumn Flame select.  Nice looking stuff.  The pallets ready to ship are 2 tons, and the pick your own had 5 pieces in it, 2 of which were definitely not select.  Asked to get a new pallet to choose from and "Oh we can't we'd have to break down the pallet and then we have a ton left over".  So you're not going to take an $800 sale so you can get $1600?  GFY.  Good For You.  You lost my business and anyone else that cares about just good business for good people.  Shame on these guys. Especially the effort to break down a pallet when the 3 yard workers were gazing longingly at their rocks and DG.  So SORRY to make them work!  GFY.< /Text>

I thought everyone at SWB was very professional and helpful, from the sales staff to the guys out in the yard.  They helped us find the best pieces for our project, stacked them onto a pallet, and did a great job loading. The sales staff explained their pricing which I thought was competitive. Of course if you are buying small amounts, eg. DG and they have to measure on demand, you will pay a premium, but that's the nature of buying in 50 lb bags  versus bulk.</text>

YES, finally it is open. The food tastes mostly pretty good and so with the soup base. But the downside is that the service is way to slow and people there are very forgetful. Oh yeah, NEVER be after 6 because then the 15% will be gone and you will need to wait in a long line. Always eat all you can eat expect when u only eat one plate of food. Hope u enjoy.<//text>

I have been here a few times and usually never have a problem, the food is great. However this occurrence was of the less pleasant. Our order was messed up and we got the other tables food and they got our food. We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come back out and ate all the appetizers and were to full to eat anymore.</review>

So, I visit this place a week ago, and it wasn't as good as the other times I've been to in the original San Francisco location. I was surprised, as this location had just opened, but we were going in the low part of the week and the staff seem to be having difficulty prioritizing certain things, like getting us menus, getting our order, refilling our soup. my wife does really like this restaurant, and her other experience here with her friends was better. I hope that when I come back, I can improve my assessment.< /text>

<Review>It just open and is busy as heck. Been there three times already. Good food and service. All you can drink is awesome. I wish there were more meat, broth and sauce options though.< /Review>< Pictures>

Expensive (as to be expected for all you can eat shabu) and delicious! Good meat quality, yummy fresh veggies and soup broths (we had spicy miso and chicken ginger). The table favorites were the kobe beef and the shitaki mushrooms. Fast for the day so you have a big appetite when you checkout this treat yourself spot for an early dinner (happy hour is 5-6pm). Dont forget to save enough room for the red bean and green tea ice cream at the end.</review>

<time>1526878760128< /time><Review>I took my family here and we had a great time. We were seated toward the back. The table had 2 burners and so we figured we would do the ginger chicken broth and the spicy miso. It turned out they had dividers for the pots so we did half and half for both. It turns out we all liked the spicy miso the best. They had great prices and we did all you can eat so didn't have to worry about portion sizes. We also tried the gyoza which was really good as well. I definitely recommend this place and will be back.< /Review>< Rating>

No thanks. Quite pricey, as well.< /Text>

< Review>
I stopped in for lunch when I was in the area. My friend and I placed an order them went outside and sat down at some tables. They brought out our food and were very nice and friendly. I got the patty melt sandwich and a soda. I asked for it on sourdough bread and it was very good. Hot and fresh tasting. My friend got a Ruben sandwich and he liked his very much also. I highly recommend Farid Restaurant. We both had a great lunch.</Review>

This place is amazing. Honestly some of the best Mediterranean food I have ever had!! The menu is extremely varied, and the deserts are unreal. They ship in sweets from turkey and have house made baklava that is so so good. The service is excellent and the owner is such a nice guy. If I could give it ten stars I would.</text>

This is a great addition to the Bernal/Noe/La Lengua corridor. We splurged and ordered both the mixed grill plate and the mixed platter of falafel, hummus, baba ghanoush, etc. Everything was phenomenal - we both agreed this was the best Turkish food we have ever eaten in the US. We were generously comped a portion (two pieces) of baklava for being seated late, but it was not really necessary for the owners to do so - the baklava was also delicious, by the way. Highly recommended!<//Text>

Pretty sure this is the best Persian food anywhere in downtown. There are Mediterranean and Persian restaurants skittle throughout downtown LA, but this one serves the best koobideh I've ever had. The texture of the meat is so tender, so moist, and well seasoned. This will be a regular lunch spot for me!< /review>

As a big Mediterranean, Greek and all that kind of food fan, I was very impressed with the Persian style done up here.

My buddy Carlos recommended it as a place he had frequented back in the days when his lunch hour could pass like a couple good episodes of Seinfeld would have surly done to anyone in 1997.

It provided a place to find refuge and solace from trying to keep up with the street preaching gig he had on the same block.
It is in

"Goddamn" I said. "Lets check this place out!."

We were. both silently eager to see if it holds up after all these years and. without anything to retreat from.

Guess what?

It did!

I had the beef sandwich which was basically a donor kebab but with a little Persian twist I can't really explain other than to tell you to give it a shot in the mouth and see what comes of it.<//text>

Juicy, petfectly grilled and delicious chicken kabob with cranberry rice!  With side sald - and only $8 bicks. Filling and delicious.  Classic hole-in-the wall place. Parking is terrible.</Text>

I'm really hesitant to give them 5 stars only because it's my first time coming here and 5 stars are earned with repeat visits or spectacular experiences. But goodness, I almost gave them 5 stars.

I really am picky with Persian food. I grew up eating it a lot.
My husband and I were at the Jewelry District hunting around and it was time to eat. I had seen another Persian food place down the street first and had my heart set on Persian food. We showed up to the place and, god, they were so rude about being closed (even though we were able to go in and sit before realizing they were closed). But this isn't about them.
Ended up finding this place on chance, walking back to browse for another place.

Happy find! First off, we didn't realize they were on the last hour of closing. We didn't realize it because we didn't feel rushed! We weren't the only ones there, but still, the employees were AWESOME with the hospitality and service.

The food, omg, that basmati was so delicious! Took me back to my childhood. Mom will love this place when I bring her! The meat, omg, the meat, I'm salivating just remembering how juicy and tender this meat was. Bravo!

You gotta come here. But come early. I think they close early (look at the hours I suppose lol)

You know what, i'm changing my rating. 5 stars it is!< /text>

I had to go to Santee Alley to buy some stuff so that's why i stop by in this restaurant,  My experience as a first time customer is horrible, Food was not 100% cooked, Service was pretty slow, Table was almost half clean, I really wanted to enjoy this experience but it didn't happen, I do not recomended ... and I Will never go back in that hell....<//Review>

Farid is a wonderful hole-in-the wall restaurant downtown.  They have great lunch specials.  The shish-kabob is amazing.  It's strange though, it seems they only have three looping tapes for their VCR - it's always Whitney Houston, Beyonce, or Shakira.<//Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Food was amazing, burgers were cooked perfectly and the amount of food you get is worth going for. Service was a little off, we got sat in one of the first booths and were basically ignored after we got our food. Whoever was running the show was barking orders at staff in front of the patrons which was bitter sweet because it showed they run a tight ship, but at the same time I'm trying to enjoy my meal, not hear the supervisor yell orders at the staff while she's standing right next to both of our empty drinks that were never refilled. Still worth going, not many places can make a better burger in town.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Time>1623271689476<//Time><Text>Sorry to say, not the best. I bought a avocado cheese burger & soda. My friend bought a veggie burger. Both burgers seemed at best room temp. However, my avocado was so hard I had to take a piece out of my mouth as not to break a tooth!! Lol
The manager came over and asked if I would like another burger or refund. I said refund, but still got billed for the soda... $3.21
I hadn't see my friend I was with for years so the embarrassment and damage was already done, when I had to take the whole piece out of my mouth
I will not go to that Red Robin again!!<//Text></record>

I almost didn't post, but had to. My Mom, son, and I went to Red Robin around 6:00 last night. We had completely forgotten that it was grad night for many local schools. When we were told 30 mins, we decided to wait. During our wait, we witnessed verbal assaults towards staff, people asking staff to make other people leave so they could have a table, and just overall examples of extreme rudeness towards staff. There was one party of over 10 that insisted they be seated in the 75 minutes they were quoted. 85 minutes in, they were threatening to call "corporate" if they weren't seated. They also called the other party that they were waiting to leave, "disrespectful of others time". I was honestly shocked by the lack of understanding. It was grad night and parties were celebrating. I honestly couldn't even imagine dealing with the nastiness that those hosts/managers experienced in the 27 minutes that we waited for a table. Even with all that was going on, our food came out fast/delicious, and our server was amazing admist all the chaos. The Red Robin staff handled pressure and rudeness like trained pros. They will always have our business.</text>

<review>They've had a three-star up until this post,
Our waitress was fantastic and worked from start to finish, her name was Heidi ! And for the first time, I had the fish and chips, the cod was huge and flaky and cooked to perfection,  it was a real delight : )
My eating partner, she had the
whiskey bacon cheeseburger medium rare and it was again fabulously cooked and smelt terrific, onion rings are always something to gorge on with large glasses of sweet tea : ))</review>< UserId.>

I eat here about 3 times a week. Never any problems so i tip good.
Maybe its the way i look or because im native but i really felt that the waiters disrespected me and my girl. For no reason. We dont feel like we want to ever go back.
My family has been fighting for this land for 100s of years and we still are to this day as military/army/navy ect. Its sad just because im not dressed up all the time i should be disrespected. After all we offer our lives so America can sleep good and safe or can eat good.
Just dont go around 3pm. On a Sunday very bad service or no service at all. Our appetizers came dry and no ranch waiter did not ask if we needed anything but they kept walking by. Also my drink was spilling over on the table as another waiter put it there expecting me to clean the mess up my self. With the one napkin that was added to my menu. After me and my girl waite for help on the ranch and the drink mess. No help was offered but waiters did walk by and look at us as if we were not wanted or welcome. So i decided i did not like the way were where treated i offered to pay for the bad service i received and left after i canceled the rest of my order.<//Text>

Okay, so I really like Red Robin, because of their sides like mac and cheese and garlic steak fries. Next time I go there, I will try the mac and cheese burger. That sounds awesome. The mac and cheese is actually made from a homemade roux and cheddar sauce. I thought the first time I was there that the burgers were super good. They were. But the crazy thing is that they don't top Denny's burger TO ME. Blasphemy, I know...The patty was definitely way thicker than nasty ol' McDonald's and Burger King, but I wasn't sure if it was a patty pre-made, or a hand-patted out one.... Not that impressive. I'm giving five stars for the menu, service and choices of cheese and bread alone. It was a bit thin for a $12 burger. There are visual signs of the obvious hand patting of the that I like to see, like the uneven edges where it splits and you tried to shape it right🤭 I don't know if I saw that on my RR, but the burgers ARE super good and they come with this really great seasoning you can put on them. I'm def goin back! Yuuuuummmmm!< /review>

The selection was good & the service was quick, considering how busy they were & the number in our party. I was trying to be diet conscious, so ordered the chicken tortilla soup, which was delicious, but the bowl was too small. However, it did help maintain my diet.

Service was great! "Forced" outside dining is one the the unnecessary covid outrages which is why I cant give a fifth star here. Food was good for what you expect from this restaurant, gets picked  by my kids when its their turn to choose :)<//text>

<Review>I am very impressed with their COVID procedures, everyone was in masks and taking precautions. I also always appreciate their special attention to allergies as I have several. The food hits the spot, the service is great, and all the gluten-free options are really flavourful. Thank you guys for working so hard to provide a safe environment for eating 👍🏻</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Ordered ours for pickup. They got the order 100% correct, were ready on time, were very fast, and they gave us more fries than we expected! Can't go wrong with that! Best of all, food was EXCELLENT! Overall a 5-star experience. My only suggestion: request more fries dip! At least 3x what they would normally give you. It goes fast!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

There is no indoor dining in Redding and so I showed up and they immediately took my order. I waited about 15 minutes and I was able to get my food. It was nice and hot and fresh.< /review>

Today was the day i first tried it. I had no idea you get unlimited fries that's so cool! I freaking love fries! Theyre pretty good to! Staff were very friendly and the place is very clean. The burger is alright its not super fancy. Their rewards is pretty cool i think is 10 visits you get something free. Oh and on your birthday you'll get a free burger! They also will sing you a happy birthday song! That place is best to go for the unlimited fries!!!</review></record></dataset><record>

Shockingly impressed. Service was fast and friendly. Food was very good. fish and chips tasted fresh and we're cooked to perfection.

I was also surprised to be happy with the covid-19 safety procedures. Redding California can be very hit-and-miss with covid-19 safety. But this place seem to be doing a really good job.</review>

<text>It was wonderful! From the pretzel bites to the bottomless mandarin oranges. Helk, I didn't even mind them singing me the birthday song.

Got the "gourmet" bacon cheeseburger, but it was surprisingly lacking flavor thereby negating the gourmet description. Ordered the cheeseburger with pink in the middle and it was lacking any pink at all. Frankly, I can get a better burger at half the cost from McDonald's or Carl's Jr. Fries and onion rings were good. The Freckled Lemonade was horribly watered down, tasting more like water with lemon, and had only two freckles in the two slices of strawberry. The Poppin' Purple Lemonade was dangerously awesome!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I love red Robin! But.... some how some way I can tell them I want my burger DEAD, burnt, non mooing and it always comes out first not dead, pink or medium rare.. then I do the whole send it back but I never end up eating it after that.... seeing blood or even pink in my food grosses me out and I lose my appetite. I know weird but the manager does always make up for it in one way or another. Just wish it would come out right the first time!< /Review>

< Review>
I love Red Robin. Always have and always will. I do have a small “karen“ rant though. Around 9:40 pm a few days ago, after my table had finished paying and we were chatting, our server came up to us and asked to bus our table and said “I’m about to hit overtime here so I need to get this cleaned up.” We were all confused because Red Robin closes at 10 Or 11 usually. Then as we left we saw a sign on the door stating new covid hours meant closing was at 9pm. First of all, when we arrived your doors were wide open, so no one is reading your signs. Secondly, just tell people you close at 9 rather than waiting 40 minutes for us to leave and then passive aggressively begin clearing our table. And third, how does closing an hour or two earlier prevent the virus? Seriously? I still love Red Robin but businesses changing their hours because of the pandemic is just so stupid. And hey, notifying people properly of your new hours is key 👍🏻</Review>

<text>I’m giving one star because I want this message to flag the management.  I enjoy this Red Robin for the atmosphere and the food, but today I left.  I wish that we could all live together and find the balance between the differences we all have and not keep infringing on ones rights to support another’s. They had a guest come for lunch with their large long  haired dog,.  Now I understand this is very common today and is supposed to be accepted and tolerated without question or complaint.  But I had to exercise my only remaining freedom after the host sat these guests just on the other side of the kitchen wall.   I had a long haired cat and I know those hairs travel, and human traffic and ceiling fans are great mixers.  Why can’t the balance be seating the pets away from the kitchen?!.<//text>< Pics>

Much more variety on the menu than I expected. Excellent burgers done to the proper medium rare without having to ask. Staff is super friendly and attentive, and they really belted out that birthday song for my wife. Chili is way better than most chains. Next trip I'm trying the fish & chips and the clam chowder (which is on the daily menu, not just Fridays!).< /review>

<Text>I love their food, it is delicious!!!! But one time on my sister’s birthday, they lost our order and we waited and waited for about 2 hours before our food came, and they gave us our dinner for half off and apologized several times. I know this happens rarely, but it still was frustrating, and they should’ve given us the meal for free. I’m giving it a four because I really do enjoy their food, but one star was taken off because of this mishap. Sorry Red Robin!< /Text>< Pictures>

We placed our order, and we received both appetizer and main dishes at the same time. The waitress apologized and the manager came by and apologized as well. He also made it right by giving us a discount for the inconvenience. The food was hot and delicious. The service made the experience for sure. We will definately return.<//text>< Pics>

The food is usually pretty good, and the services is great. But we went to the Redding Ca. location a few days ago and the place was so dirty. Starting with the glass doors and window! Then as we were seated there was food and napkins all over the floor. Then the table we were sat at was dirty. As we sat waiting for our order we noticed the blinds were covered in dust. And then noticed the lamp above our table (and all others we could see) were also covered in dust. Come on...clean this place up...or we will not be back!!!< /Text>

<text>First off I’d like to say My family loves Red Robin, and I chose Red Robin over other restaurants for dinner because I “THOUGHT” we could expect quality out them, being that they are an established chain and carry deep similarities throughout their locations.

My first impression of the restaurant was “Man, they have lots of entertainment for kids here.” They have personal chalk boards and a big chalkboard on the wall for them to draw on while you wait to be seated.

We arrived at 7:15 and was seated by 7:22 (not a long wait, which was nice).

The hostess was friendly and he brought us to our table. It went downhill from there.

7:35 hits and we finally meet our server who brought some silver wear.. , then our server mumbles... “would you like something to drink” we said just water.. and she said okay. Brought us water... and we were so ready to order after waiting 15min before even being acknowledged.

It then took about 35 minutes to get our food.. keep in mind we have a 4 year old toddler who can’t sit still that long! Normally a good server at Red Robin would notice this and say, “I’ll bring some French Fries right out for her”.

....We didn’t even get offered any fries ourselves...

After speaking with the manager he kinda stumbled on his words, then said well... “We don’t bring them out before your food unless you ask... we arnt really following that bread before dinner approach” which in my find is so totally poor service. I have noticed the last couple times we’ve visited any Red Robin they have not brought them out unless we stated we wanted them in advance, and when they do bring them out there’s only like 8 fries lol. Then your food comes out with a few... and when your all finished.. they ask if you want more! “Okay sure you say”.. then they bring out more than you have received with the two servings prior... don’t you think it should be the opposite? More first and less later? Seems like better service to me...

So anyway, it didn’t end with the service being slow. The first impression of our server was not great. She had a resting “b***h face, and frowned as soon as she thought you weren’t looking. Didn’t have a great energy or vibe. To top things off I customized my burger adding onion straws and grilled pineapple. The onion straws showed up on the burger, but not the pineapple... the manager was nice and comped is $10 for the wait and burger goof. I am very appreciative of that. Shortly  after I spoke with the manager, I learned our server was new, which is fine, but I’d recommend she drink a Red Bull or soda on her next shift.

Lastly, this Red Robin appears to be very busy with groups. I’m not sure they have the staffing to keep up with all their tasks... the floors were disgusting... there was a piece of broccoli on the floor next to me the entire time.<//text>< pics>

First off you can't beat the bottomless fries! They have a great selection of burgers that are amazing not to mention huge. I was able to finish my burger just barely but when I did there was no room for my fries. Our waitress was very attentive. Although I do think they are a little overpriced for a burger joint. I get it is a restaurant but I have a hard time paying that much money for a burger and fries. I will definitely go back just not as often as I would like due to the prices.</Text>

All our food was great. Service was super quick and they never let our drinks go empty. Server was super friendly and helpful, both he and the kitchen accommodated our dietary needs and double checked to make sure everything we got was up to standards. It is a regular go to for us and our friends.<//Text>

Atmosphere...average, service...average, food...really good! Service is mostly automated. You will get your own menu from a menu stand on the table and pay your own bill on a table top computer. Maybe next time I can cook and serve my own food?< /Text>

<review>Called red robin to place our order for pick up my son went to pickup the order of 3 burgers 2 of which only had cheese bacon and mushrooms how hard is that? I guess pretty hard because they. Left 1 totally Missing and one missing the mushrooms. Then Ally the women helping my son copt a major attitude the management was going to comp my burger and Ally stared my son down and shook her head about it like my son was some sort of tight wad so he paid for the whole order even though he shouldn't have in my opinion. Poor service all the way around will NOT BE BACK EVER!!!!!! So if you chance it and go to red robin in Redding make sure and check your order before leaving!!!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Ordered on-line for curbside pick-up, even though I had signed in, my reward offer was not taken off my bill. It's supposed happen automatically. I called the restaurant and they were very helpful in getting the credit back on my card. Food was ready when they said it would be. The online menu says the fish, shrimp, & chips comes with coleslaw and chips, but i did not get the coleslaw.  Also the fish pieces were much smaller than the regular fish & chips. My wife ordered grilled onions on her cal chicken sandwich,  but the onions were not grilled. Other than that the food tasted great.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>The price benefit ratio here is exceptional. The gourmet burgers here would cost you much more at another place.

I hope no one tells them. I don't want them to raise the price.</review>< pics>

Food as always was good. Service was  kinda slow but they were slammed tonight. Server forgot dipping sauce and it took awhile to actually get it. All in all not bad. Price was even decent. Better burgers and prices at red Robin compared to Logan's Roadhouse.< /text>

Went in Saturday July 5th. My sister's burger was good, my chicken breast was the smallest I've ever gotten at a Red Robin and had to hack at it with a steak knife to try to cut it. Fries delicious as always but didn't get asked if we wanted more. I am afraid I left hungry because of the small portions. Been going to Red Robin in Salem, Oregon for years, moved down here and surprised at the service, higher prices and smaller portions. Maybe it was just an off day, still disappointed. First time this has happened at a Red Robin.</Text>

Food was great. they were really busy though and we had to sit at the bar. The bar tender got slammed and so our food sat a while. He got it to us though and I understand there wasn't much he could do. Still friendly and a good experience with good food<//Text>

I am a truck driver from Wisconsin and I have a buddy with, we team drove it since it's a 32 hour drive without adding fuel stops and restroom break, we have a delivery in the morning so we found Red Robin was offering togo orders, and who doesnt love RED ROBIN YUMMM,lol. We walked in and sanitizer available immediately and they even sanitized menu after each person looked at it... Awesome... They were wearing gloves and while talking I was telling them my buddy and I are truck drivers from Wisconsin... just want a burger and gonna go to bed, we were tired, and decided to get a hotel for one night, you know shower, shave a good comfortable  nite sleep, the manager working thanked us for our service and paid for half are meal and gave us a soda, while thanking us for keeping things moving... I am very grateful and will recommend this restaurant to every trucker I know that comes to the west, again ty so much we love your hospitality  and will definitely tell my friends family and social network of friends about this great experience... #WEAREAMERICANSTRONG<//Text>

<review>Slow service.  Greasy food.  Looks nothing like the photo.  Taste nothing like discribed.  $16.00  for a thin burnt hamburger patty.
100% better at

for a little over $3.

This place is always really busy, and loud, but that's because it's all around a really great place to eat! All that stuff is to be expected at a great restaurant! The food is wonderful, and the drinks are strong! The staff is awsome, happy, friendly, and get you enjoying your meal, in reasonably good amount of time! Great deals, and their new machines that you pay with and order from on each table are totally neat and convenient!! Love this place and their bottomless steak fries!!</review>

<review>Food is good. But waits are hit or miss. Sometimes it's 15 minutes for food. Sometimes it's 55. Also, well done is a hit and miss (most of the time I've asked by for well done on a hamburger and still gotten pink.)< /review></record></dataset><record>

They were taking orders to-go only during the Carr Fire while many of their team were being evacuated. We had been camping without service for several days and didn't know about the fire and evacuations. We were still hours from home and had to take a longer route because the fire blocked Hwy 299. We were VERY grateful Red Robin was still taking orders, we needed to eat and the food was just as good as it normally is. Good job for taking care of your team members and also taking care of us!</Text>

Was dirty and the staff would rather converse with themselves than make sure their customers were happy. Had to send back my burger because it was insanely dry. Fortunately the second one was fantastic and the fries are bottomless< /review>

<Review>This place is always really busy, and loud, but that's because it's all around a really great place to eat! All that stuff is to be expected at a great restaurant! The food is wonderful, and the drinks are strong! The staff is awsome, happy, friendly, and get you enjoying your meal, in reasonably good amount of time! Great deals, and their new machines that you pay with and order from on each table are totally neat and convenient!! Love this place and their bottomless steak fries!!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Rude. Waiter was trying to flirt with the table across the way and did not have time for my table. They have 12 clean open tables and put us next to the kitchen. Back of house people was having fun and playing loud music that I dont want to listen to. When I asked to move it was a big deal. Even though they had tables.  If we did not drive an hour to get here because my child wanted to eat here for her special occasion we would have eaten at in and out. The food was wrong. Drinks was not filled just over all badly ran. Maybe the manager just doesn't know or care what is going on.< /text>< Name>

Our waitress spent majority of the time gossiping with the bartender. When she did come to our table every once in a great while, she was rude and appeared to be in a bad mood. My burger came without the barbeque sauce that was listed on the menu as an ingredient for the sandwich, and was not served on their "black plate" that they push so much for their "gourmet" burgers. Fries were old and dry as if they had been sitting out in the kitchen all day. My salad was served alongside my burger on a HOT plate instead of in a cold salad bowl. Will definitely NOT be returning. Waste of money & time.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>My wife and I went there for dinner a few nights ago, we were asked if we would be okay with seating ourselves in the bar which we were totally okay with. We both got a different one of their burgers, and I tried their garlic fries. Our server continuously kept my fries full and didn't let my plate go empty until we were leaving. Neither did either of our Cups ever run dry<//Review>< date>

<text>Very fun atmosphere. We ate at the bar they were very busy at 2:00 on a Sunday. Our waitress was friendly and expressed what a great place to work!
The guys had  the guacamole and taco burgers. I enjoyed the delicious fried cod strips with the great frys. A

<Review>Great food, great people, great prices- an excellent place for a great meal!  The know gluten-free here, they have an easy-to-understand food allergy menu, and they're a test store so there are menu items and processes (like the grey "gluten-free" markers) that other Red Robin locations don't have.  Overall, an hour excellent dining experience even for folks who go to other Red Robin's regularly.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>It's not mind blowing but definitely decent. Good variety of options beyond burgers. It's kid friendly and festive. I prefer the more local and less franchise feeling Maxwell's to Red Robin when I want a burger... But if I'm meeting a group here it is good enough that I'm happy coming here.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Food very overpriced.  I had fish and chips for $14.29. The fish was not very good.  I have the one piece at The Light house and you get two pieces which is about the same amount of fish you get at Red Robin.  The quality of the fish, the batter is much better at Light House and only about , $7.50.  Red Robin is ridiculously noisy.  You can't hardly visit.  The waitresses were the best thing at Red Robin.  They are very good.< /Review>

< Review>
The place is always busy and hopping with activity. Great place to go with a group and/or birthday party, but loud for a date. Their burgers are getting a little more pricey, but with all the bottomless options, it’s worth it. Love the purple bottomless drink, I can’t remember what it’s called. And of course the bottomless fries. Right now, my favorite is the whiskey river chicken wrap. So delicious.< /Review>

I have been to Red Robin gourmet burgers several times over the last 18 years and though I do not always agree with their prices I have yet to get a bad burger from them I think their burgers are incredible I will tell you the trick though to the Red Robin burger don't ever order the extra large Burger because the meats no bigger only the bun is but then again they give you a free Burger on your birthday I would recommend Red Robin gourmet burgers to anybody with or without kids likes to enjoy a good burger and fries< /text>

Went there for the first time in a while. All remodeled. Looks great. Had swiss mushroom burger. Very good. Service was on top of his game. Sorry forgot name. Soda never went dry, fries were topped. Felt much better money spent/quality of food and service.<//review>

My and I had a great server. She was very quick to try to fix out food but all in all it was horrible food. I had ordered a chicken burger with grilled pine apple and teriyaki sauce. My mom had ordered a chicken mushroom Swiss burger and my father ordered a chicken salad. Our first batch of fries we had received was extremely over seasoned and inedible with the amount of salt on them. Our server then rushed to get us new ones after apologizing but the batch she had brought back had zero seasoning at all. Both my mom and I' s burgers were so soggy that we couldn't pick them up and had to eat with fork and knife. My chicken was smothered in sauce that was was very thick like syrup and unpleasant to eat. The pine apple had a metallic taste like it was stored in a can. My mom's burger tasted fine but was so soggy and runny from wet mushrooms. My father's salad came with blackened chicken and once again way over seasoned. It was a very unpleasant lunch but our server was great and made up for it.<//Text>

Service was great, polite and attentive. Decent beer selection. Burger wasn't quite worth the $15, as I asked for medium and it was cooked on the well done side of well done. Fries were kinda soggy but seasoned well. I would love to come back for dessert / adult beverages only as they all looked delicious. Overall, just not quite what I was hoping for. I don't know what I was expecting from a chain restaurant, and the idea is great, but the execution was sub par.< /Text>

The selection of burgers is great and they are all tasty. The bottomless fries is a winner but I seem to never get around to ordering too many. Milkshakes are nice and think and you get a little extra with an order. The bar here is acceptable but it's expensive and pretty basic. Service is always fast and friendly.< /Review>

I actually like this place a lot most of the time they're almost I would say very consistent and expects to either Burgers to A-1 and Southern Charm are by far my favorite and if I think of a type of Applebee's place that serves burgers this is at or just a simple date night plus there's hard alcohol so that's always a bonus it's just that the drinks are watered down and not worth what you're paying for them otherwise I like redrobin lot just don't order the onion rings and y'all have a good time I just hate city is blue with almost nothing but chains but also my girlfriend is gluten intolerant so she can't have wheat this is by far one of the only places I have found in Redding where you can actually get gluten-free buns so while i indulge in my gluten she can for once not have to get a burger protein style let alone if you order from the Hyatt menus get a good quality cotton beef and you can't argue with unlimited fries now if only they would do unlimited drinks....😄< /Review>

Their prices are what could be expected for a sit down restaurant, but you do get a great meal for your money. With most of their burgers you get bottomless steak fries. They will keep bringing them until you leave. (Don't be afraid to ask for them to be made to order though, they will accommodate you.)

Our server checked in with us, and made sure that we always had water and soda in our glasses. (Which was not an easy talk for a party of 12.) The manager even came and talked with us to see how everything was going.

Try the Campfire sauce with your fries and even on your burger. It's free, you just have to ask for it.</Review>

<text>We went for mothers bday dinner and were shocked at how fast the service was. We got in fast and our food served fast. The food was excellent also. The only complaint is the waitress didn't come to the table the whole time we were eating so we needed some things like refills of fries and water.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< user_name>

<Text>Loved it! Great food, and attentive staff. Although there was an older, non-uniformed lady (franchise owner, maybe?) who seemed to be interfering with what our waitress was doing for us even though she was doing a perfectly fine job. Older lady brought us our food and the waitress came to our table, flustered about where our food went. I've been that waitress and I know how much that sucks, so that was annoying. Otherwise everything was nice and the little tablet at the table for customers was really cool.< /Text>< name>

<Text>A nice Red Robin establishment, not super busy durning the lunch rush.  Unfortunately we had to ask for a table to be cleaned and noticed nearly every other patron had to do the same.  Food came out fairly timely and the burger was actually cooked through (exactly how I wanted it).  Waitress wasn't very attentive, but was nice nonetheless.< /Text><Time>1529529386525<//Time><response>None</response><user_name>Karyn Williams-Stanshaw<//user_name>< user_id>

<Text>Good service. The BlackBerry tea was refreshing and bottomless, and the blackberry cream soda was surprisingly good - not very sweet and plenty fizzy. We enjoyed the Avo-Cobb-O and Southwestern salads, and the Fajita burger was very tasty.

I thought for being a packed house on Saturday it wasn't bad I still got pretty good service. I like the pay and go feature. My bf didn't like how there was a big gap of bread between the meat and the edge of the bun but I think all and all it was good. I like that they have a veggie burger and salads for this vegetarian /vegan.<//review>

Decent place to get a bite to eat. Clucks N fries with Buzz sauce and ranch is good. Waitress was sarcastically fun. Still if you are used to how Red Robin was a while back when they would bring bottomless fries when you say and refilled then without asking, those were the good days, now they charge you if someone sits at your table and doesn't order any, a "seat" fee.<//review>

It has been a few years since I have eaten at this location.  I was extremely disappointed this visit.   I will say up front the manager did discount the meal but I still will not return.  Service was subpar at best.  Food was ice cold when served and the place was dirty.  The glassware had a film on it and I looked at others next to us and the glassware looked the same.  We requested new drinks along and the manager said they would bring them from the bar because other glasses were cleaner. Our food had to be recooked.  As we were waiting for our food tables around us were complaining about the time it took to get food and or the quality.  My daughter said she had a similar experience with the one in Roseville recently.  Sorry Red Robin I won’t be going back.</text>

It was pretty decent for how packed they were. Me and my boyfriend got our seats right when we came in and the food had some wait but there was birthdays going around the whole time so people were busy. But the customer service was great and so was timing. Thank you!! ❤️< /Text>

<Text>Their prices are what could be expected for a sit down restaurant, but you do get a great meal for your money. With most of their burgers you get bottomless steak fries. They will keep bringing them until you leave. (Don't be afraid to ask for them to be made to order though, they will accommodate you.)

Our server checked in with us, and made sure that we always had water and soda in our glasses. (Which was not an easy talk for a party of 12.) The manager even came and talked with us to see how everything was going.

Try the Campfire sauce with your fries and even on your burger. It's free, you just have to ask for it.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We sat in the bar area tables with great service.  We ordered burning love burger and southwest salad.  Food was so-so and I seem to remember it being much better quality at previous/other Red Robins.  Bottomless fries were excellent.</Review>

They have pretty good burgers for a chain restaurant.  $9-13 range.  Not a bad selection of beers/drinks.  Good place for birthdays or groups.  Loud and busy environment.</Review>

Red Robin has the best gluten free burgers anywhere and they have gluten free buns too...which makes them AWESOME! They also have a fryer just for gluten free fries. The staff is always polite and helpful and if they do screw up they are happy to fix their mistake and will even take it off the check if their screw up was bad enough. I go as often as I can...that's how good they are!<//review>

Great food. Love the wedge burger style, and bottomless steamed broccoli. Great service.  However it is definitely a family restaurant, very noisy and no curtains or carpeting to dull the noise.<//review>

Love Red Robin, but tonight our waitress thought I was going steel wine glass, I was so embarrassed when I wanted to buy one, she ignored me when I asked more bottom less fries, acted like I wasn't even their. I had to step out. My daughter fiance was there too Spoke to manager he was very nice. Just very disappointed how people make judgment when we spent over $120.00 on dinner, & it was my daughters birthday too.<//Text>

Last time we ate here, our waitress didn’t even greet us for over 45 minutes didn’t get drinks for over an hour and saw our waitress a total of 3 times and not once was she bringing us drinks, food or even asking us if we needed anything. Thank god for the server who noticed and took us on along with the rest of his own tables.<//Text>

Best place for burgers hands down. Never had a tastier burger in my life before. A lot better than Mcdonalds, Burger King, etc etc. If you want quality burger go to Red Robbins.<//text>

Went in couple days ago and only giving a 3 star because  waitress Was absolutely horrible. She never brought us are ranch when we asked  multiple times  For it then rolled her eyes when I asked for her name .  So if you get a waitress name Athena head to the door and run  . Or better yet ask for a different  waitress .</text>

Red Robin is an okey burger restaurant. But it is better than fast food restaurants. The best are the French fries. They are very thick and tasty. Some drinks are bottomless and the fries too.</Review>

The food is good, as always.  But the service was lacking. When we have to ask constantly to get more fries or refills on soda and still doesn't happen,  that's not service.  Bottom less fries actually did have a bottom,  and it was apparently after our FIRST serving.  Not impressed at all<//review>

The quality of food has really gone down hill, you used to get a great burger here. The last few times I've been there usually for a birthday I said we wouldn't go back. This was the last straw, I'm giving up on this place.< /Review>

<review>I love these burgers and they have gluten free buns! The service is pretty good, I always order online for carryout and the food always takes longer than the estimated pickup time, but it's worth the wait.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I have gone here many times throughout my life growing up in the area, and it has always been one of my favorites. However, when we went last week, the experience was not good. When the server brought the food out, we asked for a refill on our basket of fries. She said, “Sure,” but she never came back. We are all of our food, and still no more fries. There was a group of about 25 arriving, and it seemed every employee’s focus was on them and the rest of us were ignored. We used the kiosk thing to call the waiter. It blinks so they know you need something. Our table got walked passed 12 times by various employees before finally a manager acknowledged us. We almost debated not even asking for more fries and risk sitting there for an even longer time to finish up and get the bill. Kiosk wouldn’t take my rewards number so the manager had to run it manually. This is one of the ONLY bad experiences I’ve had here. It will not keep me from returning. This visit was a 1 Star, but I give it a 3 because of many positive experiences. Side note, food was excellent as always.</Text>

We arrived in town late so I figured RR was a safe bet.  Boy, was I wrong!  The chili cheese fries had zero flavor, the floor was so dirty it was slippery, AND the employees whined and complained about their job and other employees non-stop.   The horrible experience was tipped by wait staff cussing up a storm in the bar with a little boy waiting out front for his parent in the bathroom.  Unacceptable behavior RR!<//Text>

<Review>Still waiting for our food, over 30 minutes now. Simple order for family of four, placed at 12:02, before lunch rush hit. I can make my own burgers at home and have them grilled by now. My order better come out correct or I will file a much bigger complaint then just a bad review.<//Review>< Time>

The menu is much shorter than it used to be, the "cup" of chowder is more like a half-cup, the prices higher than ever before. Another good eatery gone "just-plain-average".< /Text>

< Review>
My son and I went for lunch. We were the first customers in the door and the second to order. While waiting the 45 min it took to get our food we watched several other patrons get served. In the end it was 2 drinks and 2 mediocre burgers for 30$... burgers were good but not 30$ good and were not cooked to order</Review>

The "bottomless fries"  is a joke. Not only did our server seem to avoid our table all together, we had to ask to get our fries back because she took the basket the first time to get more but never came back with any. We waited and waited as our server kept passing by our table serving guests around us.
More insulting that she acted as casual as possible, as if our visit wasn't taking forever with no food or drinks .
Terrible experience for mediocre food.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

<rate>4< /rate><text>4 stars cuz is cost a bit for me but if you got the money is worth it. I ate so many French fries so Good the hamburger I saved took home ate it while watching a movie. I really enjoyed their food so yummy . If you got a bit to spend go here food is super good, and if you drink they have a bar you can eat in there. I recamend to reserve if they do that cuz can be crowded, but is nice and service is very good</text>< Pictures>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Service was horrible I had to ask for a lemon for my water more than once, my husband ordered ice tea they brought raspberry tea, the wait to even get a waitress was close to 30 minutes. Then 15 minutes to get water and tea..another 15 waiting on lemon requested twice. Another 40 for food that looked like it had been tossed together and literally thrown at the plate. Oh and no silverware. My burger was messy and didn't even have a fork to eat it with. Ridiculous waste of $40.<//review><time>1527044158850</time>< GmapID>

<review>Noisy, overpriced, and nothing you can't make at home. I hadn't been in here for several years, and I was shocked by the increase in the prices. On top of that, I could barely get into the lobby with the number of people waiting for tables. I just don't understand the fascination with the place. Why would I pay $100 for burgers for a family of four? In the future, I won't.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Place has gone down hill. Used to be my favorite Berger place, now there servings are small the servers don't know the menu very well or the restaurant. They don't refill your drinks or fries unless you track them down and ask, even then it's another 10 minutes before you get it done.<//review>

The food is usually pretty good the service is usually better then it was this last time we went. The place wasnt really that busy I've seen it busier they did have quiet a few people in there but nothing crazy. Our waitress kept forgetting things and we had to ask multiple times and she just kinda seemed like she was sad or didnt want to be there. I didnt know what one it was but as a fellow waitress I know the job (waitressing) can have it's hard moments but you just have to put on a smile and keep going.< /Text>

Bartender was. Rude and unhelpful. My first visit to a red Robin restaurant. She did no make eye contact or ask questions. Not even said thank you. I ask about the choices I had witch she did not make any suggestions. She vanish from de bar area and o had to ask a server to refill my drink. Really bad service<//Text>

Good food, GREAT service!  We were there with family, 4 of the 5 of us had special requests due to diets and health issues.  All were accommodated and every order was right.  Our server was Katie.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  She kept my husband's water glass full(no easy task) and even made it seem like her not understanding my father was the fault of her hearing in a noisey room. He has a neorological issue that causes his speech to be garbled.  I could have hugged her for that.</review>

Poutine! Need I say more! They have really upped their game on burgers. The A-1 peppercorn burger was excellent. It's really hard to find a good burger these days. If you're going to be a bear, be a griz!<//Text>

<Review>I have eaten here 3 times and this is the worst experience. Im sorry to report but the waitress that servwd my table was very rude, she forgot our straws for our drinks and when I flagged her down after ignoring me saying Exscuse me several times, she pulled the straws from her apron and tossed them on the table. When she brought our food I asked for new silver ware because my fork was dirty, she gave me attitude for that. Then never came back to check our table. She walked by and sat our bill on the table and walked off. When we left we checked out at the front and the cashier gave her our credit card to run and she said it was denied so we paid cash. When we got to our car we check with our card company and their was plenty money on the card. She didn't show a receipt that she ran the card to show it was denied. I also used the rest room their and the place has really went down hill, the bathrooms were disgusting and soap dispencer didnt work, toilets filthy. I will never go here again!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Beefy looking waiter sucked. He hardly checked on us and when asked for a box, he forgot and was sitting down, chatting. We left without the rest of the food. Food took a long time to come out too. Very disappointed.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I have eaten here 3 times and this is the worst experience. Im sorry to report but the waitress that servwd my table was very rude, she forgot our straws for our drinks and when I flagged her down after ignoring me saying Exscuse me several times, she pulled the straws from her apron and tossed them on the table. When she brought our food I asked for new silver ware because my fork was dirty, she gave me attitude for that. Then never came back to check our table. She walked by and sat our bill on the table and walked off. When we left we checked out at the front and the cashier gave her our credit card to run and she said it was denied so we paid cash. When we got to our car we check with our card company and their was plenty money on the card. She didn't show a receipt that she ran the card to show it was denied. I also used the rest room their and the place has really went down hill, the bathrooms were disgusting and soap dispencer didnt work, toilets filthy. I will never go here again!< /text>< Pics>

<review>Busy and little noisey but what's that when youre celebrating birthdays with the family and got all the fries you can eat!  Probably an in frequent happening but it was embarrassing for our 17yr old g-daughter to have to ask replacement burger due to dressing being applied contrary to the order.< /review>< time>

Server knocked the sandwich off the plate when she delivered to table, did not offer to replace it. The sweet potato fries were cold, the BLT Croissant had very little crumbled bacon.</Review>

Had the blue cheese burger, husband had bacon cheeseburger. Tomato on burger more orange looking than red. Overall I would say this place is more hype than anything. Need to improve service and don't expect me to automatically give you a 20 percentage when I check out at my table. I couldn't believe that is what they suggested considering the fact 2 burger and ice tea< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Had the blue cheese burger, husband had bacon cheeseburger. Tomato on burger more orange looking than red. Overall I would say this place is more hype than anything. Need to improve service and don't expect me to automatically give you a 20 percentage when I check out at my table. I couldn't believe that is what they suggested considering the fact 2 burger and ice tea< /Review>< pictures>

If I could leave a zero I would. Floors were slimy and very dirty. Waitress was rude and forgot or food for almost an hr. Food was cold. I said something to manager and seemed like he didnt care. Never again. Not a good way to to treat a vet in veteran's day.<//text>
