<Text>I visited the one in Moreno Valley. Had a great experience. The staff is super nice and friendly. They were very helpful and explained everything very well. I’m not giving it five stars because it’s been two weeks and I still haven’t received my glasses other than that, I have no complaints from this place.</Text><user>112626697290941542631</user><date>1618420123052<//date></record></dataset><record>

My wife uses contacts so we came here to get heran extra pair. They were very helpful and friendly. This place is close to our house so that was nice. The prices are fair, not cheap but not too expensive either. My wife was happy with the pair of contacts that she got here. I would recommend this business</Text>

<Text>Went for a contact exam and prescription for my very first time using contacts.
The test consisted in two visit.
My first visit the ladies in the font office went ahead and place my order
with out explaining I had to await for my fallow up in case my prescription changed which it did.
When I try to get the right product I need turns out I cant,
that I have to pay again for the right prescription and wait for a mail in refund that can take up to two weeks !!!
I understand that is the way their system works but employees should be there to help people out not to put my bank account in negative!!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I don't want to hear "My sorry"  what does that mean anyway.. Update... the first order which was wrong took over two weeks, when I had them correct them...I am still waiting and it is now going on three weeks.  How can a national eyeglass corp  take three weeks to give you your glasses.  What kind of business sense is this?  I have waited FIVE WEEKS total for my glasses.  and I still don't have them.  ( I felt that it was a hard sell and when they advertised $69.00 it quickly turned to $400. plus.  Kept saying that was what you got last time.  I asked them to get the price down more than once  and kept saying I didn't need the add ons.  They got it down to low $300.00.  I asked them to clean my glasses I got a few months earlier and pointed out  the scratches on the non scratch expensive lenses.  Oh that's normal...  I got the $69.95 lenses for 2 pair which were clearly marked and they charged me $69.95 and $99.00 for the other.  Last time which they kept referring to it took 5 days to get glasses this time it takes two weeks or more.  I called to ask status and they wouldn't even check, told me it was not long enough and they would call me. I asked them to check number because it changed and she informed me that they checked everytime to make sure the number was the same... NOT...  I don't want attitude.  I want service...for an expensive product.  Came in contact with three workers and each had an attitude...  The more I thought about it the more it ticked me off.  Haven't even got the glasses yet.  OK COVID has made us grumpy.  Its clearly not an excuse to give substandard care for something you are paying for.]</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Lately with lock down I’ve been feeling down so decided to get contacts, normally I see a eye dr in Walmart but this time I wanted a different experience. The Walmart dr makes me feel rushed and the dr I had here was extremely polite let me take my time to answer to make sure I was sure on my sight. He also explained everything is detail and I’m grateful for that.  Upon getting contacts I also chose out a pair of glasses and never had so much fun. The ladies on the floor made me feel so comfortable ( I am Socially awkward ) and made me laugh quiet a bit. They deff got a customer for life with me.</Text>

<review>I absolutely give this America’s Best Store in Moreno Valley 5 + Stars.  Very professional and thorough.  First time without an appointment and everyone was extremely nice and helpful.  I was only going in for information and ended up getting a full exam.  Dr. Velasquez was excellent highly recommend him very professional and offered many options for me.  Regina needs a raise for her wonderful assistance and also the young lady who helped me when I first walked in.  They were busy but were able to take care of everyone without causing anyone to get upset.  They manage that office without error.  I will definitely be recommending my family and friends.  Prices are reasonabl.  After going to Costco which I regretted there is no comparison.<//review>< pics>

HORRIBLE. Doctor was terrible, didn't explain what he was doing. He kept pressuring me in understanding my vision when he changed it to a whole different prescription. He completely bashed on doing my eye exams out of state(laughed at it) , highly ignorant of him. He never figured out my vision, he kept changing it. Kept saying I didn't know how to explain. Treated me like I was 5yrs old. I payed for nothing because at the end of the day he gave me the wrong prescription and never gave me a chance to tell him I didn't see 100% with it.</Text>

I did like some of the staff, very friendly.  I've been wearing glasses for quite sometime and never had a problem adjusting to my glasses until I came here. I went in there a week later from receiving my glasses to let them know my prescription was off or the lenses were faulty and they sent me home because I had to adjust to the prescription. It's been over a month and I still can not use my glasses while driving or see far period. It's completely blurry and to top it off I was told I would only pay a certain amount because I brought in my own frames and still ended up paying over $200. I definitely will not be going back.</text>

<Text>Went in for an eye exam yesterday. The facility is very well kept and the staff are very courteous. I found the cost to be very competitive as well (significantly lower than Lenscrafters). Dr. Jong was very sincere and performed the exam thoroughly. This business does not provide glasses same day  as needed for me. Albeit I went elsewhere with my prescription and had the glasses made. Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for eye exams. My prescription is on the dot. I can see very well, no headaches (as experienced with new glasses always for me).<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

Do NOT recommend this place at all. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Luckily for them i have to give 1 star. They do not call you back at all when your glasses are ready. I placed an order for replacement under warranty and didnt get a call back at all. So I called almost a month later only to find out that there wasnt an order placed for my sons broken glasses. They give sorry excuses..  I was really upset so I spoke to  Vanessa and she reassured me that she would place the order then.. it's been about 2 weeks, haven't received a call so I called today and there is NO order in for my sons glasses!!! I spoke with Amanda today and "reassured" me she will place the order today. This is a joke. They have no idea what they are doing. I am only going to them this last time because my sons glasses are still under warranty. But this is my LAST time here. This place is a joke. Workers have no knowledge. This location is the one on  Frederick, moreno valley... do NOT go there!!</Text>

< Review>
Staff are great, get that out of the way first. Bought my 2 glasses and when they came in the reading glasses we're just fine but the seeing glasses had a faulty lense on the right side and I couldn't see clearly. They said you will get use to it and I came back a week later because I couldn't see. They cost $300 not $69. I told them the I wanted tri-focal lenses and paid even more and they are no good either. Never going there ever again and tell all my friends not to either.</Review>

Came here with my brother and Father to find a frame. My dad also got his eyes checked here but it felt rushed. I'd say get your eyes checked at a private practice. Anyways, the worker Jacqueline REALLY helped us alot when it came to choosing a frame. She even fixed the leg of my dad's old frame for free. The part where the metal met the rubber got unglued and she helped fix it.</Text>

Im planning to make an appointment  in this location, but reading some of the comments  about the prices they shown on tv commercial they said its way diffrent from  the actual price. Im confused  please give us more info about the "REAL PRICES" since im on a budget and $69 is really a big help. Hope you understand  we dont like being deceived  and we dont like surprises when we get our bill. We like honesty.  Thank you< /Text>

Uggh!!! This is a nightmare,  we came here because we saw the commercial on tv , 2 pairs for $104. So we thought it was a good deal. But they can't seem to get my husband's glasses right. Today is the third time trying to get the right glasses this is the second time the eye doctor checks my husband's eyes. He can't figure it out , I just don't understand why?</text>

(Translated by Google) I was not satisfied. The adjustment to one of the lenses did not work, they told me they only did it once, very bad at that. Very dissatisfied, I paid almost $ 500dlrs.

Initially, I was totally dissatisfied with the work done. They contacted me to find out how they could help me and be satisfied, and so it was, they gave the work and time to find a solution. Thank you to the folks at the Frederick Street location, Moreno Valley, CA, as well as at the headquarters. Very satisfied and in a position to recommend them.

No quedé satisfecho. El ajuste a uno de los lentes no dio resultado, me dijeron que solo lo hacían una vez, muy mal en eso. Muy insatisfecho, pagué casi $500dlrs.

This is a horrible station. So horrible I had to waste my time reviewing it. The cashiers are dull and boring. Makes me hate my life seeing them. It wouldnt hurt if they crack a smile or greet us with a fake one. I almost always have an issue with them. Only when I change my attitude to smile that they spark up. They need to change their mood to bring life to our community. Like really lady... We see each other once a week. Spark up and makes the best of it. Don't show your sadness to customers.</text>

<review>Let's just say it's better now. This place received a facelift, overhaul not too long ago and it is not too shabby. Prior to the facelift this place look like a f****** murder scene. Because of its location be prepared to see Street people. Just stay away from the train tracks, you'll be fine.< /review>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Gas stations STEAL A LOT + arc out of 20 gas they steal 5 from you
a 3 x gallon if your car is 10 with $ 30 it would fill it with $ 50 and the same ones that it takes and not even fill

Las gasolineras ROBAN MUCHO+ arco de cada 20 de  gas te roban 5

Flavor is pretty decent, but price is not inexpensive. At $28 for dinner for a large order of meat (not all you can eat) but unlimited vegetables is still pretty good and full out the door with leftovers to bring home.

First time seeing self-serve soup base sauce in a squeeze bottle. Come to think of it, I’m sure most Shabu Shabu places does exactly the same, except the chef in the kitchen does it on your behalf, out of sight, to make you feel it’s freshly cooked. I actually like controlling the salt and flavor level on demand.

Brown/red rice was too hard though. Not that good.
I like the sample sauce presentation to help you decide which you want.

Satisfying meal, no complaints, except definitely come in prepared to spending some $$.

Restroom was clean, restaurant well lit and well maintained.< /text>

<Text>I got the $20 Joon beef and the meat quality was good. I would give 5 stars for the meat quality but 2.5 stars for veggies (my carrots were so not fresh and only so little variety) and 0.5 star for the service (server never came to check on us.. ).
For the broth, they just give you water and that's it. They have two bottles of sauces on the table and the server said one is for meat flavor and the other is for spicy flavor.. didn't seem like they were real tho.. i like shabu with real broth, not just water with the "flavor" you add from a bottle..
Anyway they give you 4 options for the sauce and get to pick two.
I think there are so many better shabu places out there for what you can get.< /Text><rating>3</rating>< Name>

My husband and I were looking into eating something healthy and filling and came across Joon Shabu 2. We were first timers so we had lots of questions Lol!! The staff was super friendly and explain everything to us from meats, vegs, broths down to the sauces. Everything was so delicious and fresh, I highly recommend it. It definitely was a great end to our date night,  Thank you Joon Shabu 2 will definitely be back.<//review>

Tried this place a day after opening and it was excellent. We got the opening special which included 3 types of meat: wagyu, rib-eye and something else. All of them were excellent cuts, especially the rib-eye. Generous portions of vegetables. The sauces were all great and unique. Will definitely return!</review>

Definitely regretting coming here. It was my first time and you spend quite a bit of money for so little food. To top it off, you have to spend additional for the broth.
It truly isn't party friend here. Party of 6 with 2 shareable 14 oz ribeye plus the broth will come out to almost $100.
You can get more for your money at an all your can eat shabu place for a little less than this place.< /Text>

This restaurant has not only great food but amazing service. This was my first time ever coming and they helped me pick my food with a friendly attitude. The food is sooooo good, 10/10 would definitely recommend!!<//Text>

<text>Never giving my business to this place. We arrived at 9:15pm and the hours of operation listed on the website and the front door states open till 10pm. We walked in and noticed two employees standing at the back shaking their heads while looking  at us. One came over and and stated that they were "closed". When we confronted him about the listed hours he said that these were weekend hours....yeah ok sure, it's probably because you don't want to be working there and want to close early. Very rude, and the employees should want to work. Two paying customers who's repeat business has been lost.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

Great atmosphere but the quality of meat falls short for the price. Vegetables and black rice are nice. Place is clean and servers are great. Still rather go to slice or California shabu.< /text>

<date>1559928050702<//date><Rate>3</Rate><Review>Is Shabu Shabu worth $25? It's definitely not my everyday lunch budget but when the occasions come, that $25 should be worth a lot of excitement. I didn't feel like there was much to get excited about at Joon Shabu 2 - the food was good, service was okay, but nothing really stood out to make me want to come back. I would still default to my long-time favorite Dada for group lunches, where we can all drown our feelings in unlimited soup and devour all types of meats and seafoods for the same cost.

My boyfriend and I shared a Tonkotsu broth with 10oz Australian lamb.
We ordered a large one-person meal because we weren't hungry enough to get a Shared entree (14oz meat, 2 servings of vegetables, $40 price tag). I thought the Tonkotsu broth smelled better than it tasted because the flavor tasted pretty weak. The meat was good, and I really liked dipping it in the sesame/goma sauce which I wish was less diluted. My favorite part of the meal was the red rice. It was the perfect texture, and it was so good I could've just ate that alone and called it a day.

The service was friendly, although kind of slow. Since we had a large group, it's hard to get everyone served at the same time. It was also weird that half our table got our bills processed and we had to wait another few minutes for the rest of our party get their bills before we could leave.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>While the food was amazing the service was awful. We were a party of five and had to swap around the sauses and plates we got as they kept forgetting what we ordered, we had 4 different wait staff ask about the check, the metal chop sticks they had couldn't get even a slight grip on the foodand my stove top kept turning off. My food (raw meat) would stop cooking because the heat would turn off, luckily I saw all my friends pots boiling constantly so I realized something was wrong with mine. They ending up having me simply move my food to the side (3-6 inches) so they could literally cut the rubber epoxy away from the stove top, pull it up, and switch it back on. I'm not blaming anyone for the fact that the stove did not work, that's not the waiters fault, but I can tell you the little chunks of plastic all around boiling water is definitely not proper food safety.

There are plenty of other shabu shabu, don't go here.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

We walked in at 5:15pm and was told they open at 5:30pm. Asked if We could sit and wait since it was 110 degrees outside, and was told no they are still getting ready.  Walked next door to Luna Rosa.  First impression is everything, not sure if we will ever be back.<//Text>

Very nice and helpful desk clerk, but terrible carwash. DO NOT use this carwash. Arms seemed broken or had clogged ports for soaps and washes. Overall felt like I just paid money to waste water and my car windshield looks the same as when I arrived. Will not use this carwash again 😑</Text>

Most of the stalls were inoperable. $3.00 for 3 minutes. Quarter machine available. Barely worth your time.< /Review>

The port I was in didnt really work. Also, you better be in shape because for $3 in quarters, you only get like 4 minutes to do all the cleaning steps and then the soap brush didn't even work well. Not very accessible for someone with a physical disability to only get that much time for that much money</Text>

Old, run down, 3.00 for 3 mins of water.  If the clock runs out you have to use 3 more dollars to get it started again.  6.00 later I wish I had just spent the extra money to go to a real car wash.  Poor value and poorly maintained equipment.<//review>

Not the cleanest place to clean your car but it's not expensive to give your car a car wash and they have vacuums on the outside and if you don't have change they have a change machine I love its distance from my house and I can always wash my car as I please there is no automated car wash near you have to wash your own car but it's the convenience been there for years and nothing has changed.<//Text>

$3 for 4 minutes. Low pressure and no spot-free rinse. Looks like it got the dirt off, but my entire vehicle is now covered in water spots.</review>

Dope place to skate. Tons of ledges, some rails and a couple stair sets. Pretty much never busy and at max there's like 10 people. Went here with my friend yesterday and is a really good beginner street park, kinda dirty though.< /Text>

Wonderful facility and people. Very friendly.

Lunch is available for members at $1.25.

2 pool tables.

Big open spaces for dance groups, crafts, and meetings.

Mostly Irainian groups and speaker meetings including various 12 step groups.

Love this facility.

Small parking lot but street and nearby public metered parking.< /review>

< review>
We switched to Primary Care Vet after I fostered a rescue dog and learned of all the ways that Primary Care assists the rescue. Our first visit with my two older, large breed dogs was smooth as could be. Great communication, efficient visit, and their check up and optional care was explained in detail. Would definitely recommend!< /review>

<Review>My experience has always been good. The front desk receptionist are very nice, considerate, and easy to talk to. The doctors are very sweet and great at communication. It is a relief to be able to talk to them about your concerns about your fur babies as well as know that they care about them. I love how convenient it is to contact pets doctor through email. When my pet isn’t doing so well with the medication, a call to the vet helps you get immediate care. I usually email them a photo or video of my pet to show them what is going on before calling them.

Such a great place to go to! I’m always content with their service and care.</Review><user_name>Rechell Saravoth< /user_name>< Rate>

<text>This is the very best veterinary animal hospital I have ever been to. Both Dr Kate and Dr Prince are very personable, patient, understanding, and compassionate. The staffs are also very accommodating and professional as well. A special recognition to Melody, she is such an amazing person and makes me feel at ease when I’m anxious and stressed about my little guy. She goes above and beyond her job duty and is truly outstanding! I’m so thankful for each and everyone at Bixby Knolls Primary Care Animal Hospital—I know my pup is in the best care here.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

I had a friend refer me to one of the doctors at this location after a bad experience at another location. They got me in right away and gave me much better insight into what was wrong with my cat. Excellent bedside manner and communication. I always get a call back or email when they say I will. Great experiences so far! I will be taking all my animals here from now on. Thank you, Dr. Kate!<//Text>

<Text>I hate to give such a good review, because the more patients they have the harder it is to get an appointment! But Dr. Kate and the staff at both locations of Primary Care Animal Hospital are always friendly and go above and beyond to be helpful. I can't explain how much I appreciate everyone there. I've had experiences with a number of other vets, and none of them come close to the service that is offered by Primary Care.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>We have been coming to this Primary Care Hospital in Bixby Hills since it opened and we are are so happy with the care we receive. Every time we enter the building we are greeted by a friendly staff who take care of your pet instantly. Dr. Prince has been amazing with my dog. She takes so much time to go over the diagnosis and carefully explain any options. You can tell she cares a great deal about animals. My dog is actually happy when he walks into the building. I highly recommend this vet to anyone looking for great care and a really great value. They will not break your bank and are very affordable.</text>< Pics>

<Text>It was difficult for me to find a hospital that was taking on new clients but I am sure glad it did because it led me to here! Reception answered the phone in a timely manner and were a delight to talk to. Dr. Prince saw my dog, Kylo, and she was very understanding and caring toward his anxious behavior. The whole experience was just a delight and reasonably priced! I look forward to having them care for my pets again!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>As a new client I called them to check our dog for allergies since she was scratching like crazy.  They got me in with Dr.  Kate the next business day.  The office staff and Dr. Kate were simply fantastic!  And the rates were very reasonable.  My mortgage company will be thrilled to know we can still make our mortgage this month.  LOL  I can't always say that with some vets.<//review><user_name>Kim C1234</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80dd3394aed24fe3:0x89e17632a4314e30<//Gmap_id>< userid>

< Review>
The best experience I ever had at a veterinarian hospital from my first phone call to the time I left the visit. All the staff were friendly and professional.
Dr. K was excellent. She was so kind, understanding, caring, thorough and professional.
I felt the entire staff cared about my little dog more than trying to make money-which these days is hard to find.
I am so thankful I found Primary Care Animal Hospital in Bixby Knolls.<//Review>

There’s no way, the vets and front desk workers here are wonderful. I can tell they really care about the animals, and I love how transparent and collaborative they are about treatment options!<//Review>

<Text>I have been seeing this vet for years at the previous location. Had a few visits in the last couple weeks and it is amazing how well my pet and I are treated. Every staff member has been kind and efficient. The doctor is amazing and has helped me so much. Hands down the best place to go.< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>I called every exotic vet in Long Beach and I couldn’t get My Guinea pig seen right away. When I found primary care animal hospital, you squeezed my Pumpkin in same day and treated him. All I needed was some antibiotics and a follow up appointment and you made it happen. I appreciate the staff  and Dr. Kate so much. Thank you again!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< Review>
My dog King was extremely lethargic and weak when I came in to get him checked on. I had already visited my primary vet (Cats & Dogs on Redondo) and spent $350 with no answers. Cats & Dogs told me that they suggest X-rays ($270), Nausea Meds ($120), and IV Fluids ($80-90) on top of the $350 already spent. That would have been a total of $820 spent at Cats & Dogs. I didn't have that kind of money so I started a GoFundMe and raised $800.00. Luckily someone recommended Primary Care Animal Hospital to me and I tried them out. Immediately the experience there was a lot different. I could tell the vet really cared about King. She took a lot of time to talk to me and to exam him. He was there with the vet for about 3.5 hours instead of the 10 minutes that Cats & Dogs took to look at King. After examining him, talking to me about his health history, and looking at his medical records, the vet was able to find a UTI. I spent a total of $180 that day with Primary Care and they found the cause of the issue, also gave him IV Fluids/Vitamins, did blood test, urine test, and gave him antibiotics and digestion supplement. Night and Day experience and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves their animal.<//Review>

<text>WOW. Can’t believe the negative comments i’m seeing. This place gets busy, so if you go in and no one “smiles” at you try to understand that they are busy taking care of their customers! I love this place, my best friends and I go here a lot. I even got my husband hooked on this place.

I love their ice cream floats. It makes me like everything in the world is going to be alright when I am sitting in a booth and there is an ice cream float, a straw and a spoon in front of me. Can't beat the feeling for such a cheap price.</review>

<review>The burgers and fries here are amazing! They have great service but the only bad thing about it is that it's next to Turlock High which means a lot of kids hangout here, but during the weekends it's a nice time to go out with family and try there ice cream! I recommend Rocky road!<//review>< GmapID>

This place was really good and the kids loved it. They also had a little play area for our 2 year old. She was content and they also serve food here as well. The staff was friendly. Will definitely be going back to this place again. Definitely better than basken and Robin<//Review>

Ice cream is good, but don't even acknowledge National Ice Cream Day, not saying you should give out free ice cream, but at least acknowledge the day, you're an ICE CREAM parlor. Not even the employees were aware of the holiday. FAIL<//review>

We went here because it advertises gluten free food and preparation. It was celiac safe but the staff still needed some direction on cross contamination safety. The food was good but our orders got mixed up a little and had to be changed. The ice cream was delicious but again the staff had to pull out the tubs to see which ones were truly gluten free. They didn't have an ingredient list to look at made yet. The kids working there were nice and friendly and overall it was okay but  they need more training to protect customers health.</Text>

{'time': 1550863971681, 'text': "Thanks for the input.  We will definately address the issues of cross contamination and us making mistakes.  As far as the ice cream goes, we intentially do not have a ingredient list because the manufacturers change thier processes/recepies without any notification to us.  Because some peoples alergies are so severe, we would rather look each time.  We are sorry you didnt have a better experience at Lulu's.  Take care, Lulu's"}<//Response>

The food is really good (try their garlic fries 👌👌). Also their costumer service is really lovely. You might even see the the owner working as the cashier, which I think is nice. The wait time isn't bad depending on what time of day it is. It's really nice at later hours during the summer because not many people are there.<//text>

<Review>Lulu's is not just an ice cream parlor.  They also serve a variety of diner foods like burgers and sandwiches. Time after time, I am met with good food, good milkshakes, and great customer service.  I come here at least once a month and always enjoy the food.  You can even order online or by phone, which is great for when I have limited time for lunch.

The decor is nice and there are tons of ice cream flavors to choose from. They also have a wide variety of fries.  I usually go for their garlic fries, but I also frequent the curly fries or the nacho cheese and jalapeño fries.

If you haven't given this place a try, I highly recommend making it one of your lunch time stops.<//Review>< pictures>

Fun vibe with lots of treats to choose from, sundaes, banana splits, milk shakes, many different flavors.  Friendly staff, clean restrooms, and full menu of food as well.  Hamburgers, sandwiches, fries, and other finger foods.  Kids love it.<//Text>

<Text>Food was good, but I couldn't get passed the candy cigarettes for sale. Motivating kids to smoke by playing smoking is basically helping kids down a path to cancer. Irresponsible! The young man working there stated, "but it doesn't say cigarettes anywhere on the package ".  Sad. Lame excuse to say candy cigarettes are OK because the word cigarettes have been removed from packaging of what we all know what it is. Owner, do the honorable thing, and put the kids before your profits.<//Text>< Name>

Being a newcomer to Turlock, I was introduced to them thru a yearly function at Chevrolet. The moment I tasted the ice cream I was in love. The next day I was there for more. Very friendly atmosphere. I haven't tasted the food yet because I love the ice cream. Matter of fact, I am got to get some today.</Text>

Passing through Turlock and this place was at the top of the list in the Find Me GF app.  This was a fun place to visit! Not only did they have delicious ice cream treats with a lot of choices, but they also had burgers, fries, sandwiches, and salads plus candy and educational toys.  The dining area was comfortable with some nice retro seating options (booths and tables).  The staff members were cheerful, helpful, and engaged with each customer in a friendly, fun manner whether a regular or a first-timer.  The facility was clean throughout including the bathroom.  I highly recommend visiting Lulu's Ice Cream Parlor.  If I lived in Turlock I would be a regular here.< /Review>

Food is great! I recommend you order your food over the phone in advance! If you place your order inside you could always sit by the bar and drink while you wait. Beer only but at a reasonable price!<//text>

<review>From out side the restaurant looks terrible. And is kinda dirty the floors etc. I was little worried about the hygiene but it had A on the window.
I was surprised by their chicken tortas OMG the best tortas I have had. I am from vegas and the mexicans in Vegas make terrible tortasx soggy and disgusting. But this place was so good omg it was fresh and tasted awesome. The chicken was fresh and crispy it had such a good after taste didnt make you feel sick like most places do after your are full you feel like aaargh I should have not eaten that.
I definitly will go out of my way to eat their tortas again when I am here in town again.
I always thought that is how tortas must taste since I did not know any better eating them first time in vegas how disgusting they were compared to this place.
Dont know about the other foods in their menu but the tortas are amazing, at least they were the day we ate there.

< Review>
I've been a young executive member at this club for a few years and absolutely love it. The level of customer service you receive is beyond what you would expect. Everytime I walk in, I'm greeted by name, as are my guests. The staff is very friendly and are always mindful of when is a good time to interject in a conversation. This is especially important during business meetings. The food is great and the atmosphere is unlike anything else in San Jose.</Review>

<Text>I would definitely give this place another try.  We visited at a very odd hour and were the only ones sitting outside. But, we were forgotten several times and I never quite knew who was providing our service. In the day, this is a membership-based dining experience. Our drinks and food were both well-prepared. This is absolutely a handicap accessible space.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6ILXtVBMNBVhvEiC4AZdyLgnW4IveSLv6zlAO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP54VyNyV085LN63ZGJEJWl7nzK15kODRaNARQf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4teSd6hlWjMtLpeiuGua8tRhpdSHj1vMfJnHo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMenSTW8ZQ9ldZAQfPOU2EJq7Nn18tEJ5vtI-HA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrGa6TR700mXJaqHsuhwcH7CN85HIKfJ8GoDpB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7f3v7dbRXhrDBYOR84im9Yz01P0FOxjkE5Ws4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Great outdoor rooftop patio on the 17th floor with nice views of down town and the mountains. Food and drinks are great and the service is awesome. Will keep coming back.

If you are looking for entertainment or wedding venue, it's fantastic. If you are looking for social not beneficial gatherings definitely good. But if you are building business, looking for network or looking for good connections save your money and look for other business oriented club .
Most members are small biz, real estate agents, insurance agents etc.

The Silicon valley Capital Club is at the top floor of the Night Ridder building in DTSJ, the place is clean and the waiters/staff are professional, the views from deck look great.<//text>

<text>I have attended a number of business and networking meetings booked in their event halls (they call them ballrooms).  They really go for the high end vibe, with all sorts of new artsy decor surrounding a decent view of San Jose and the valley. The food catered there is pretty good but nothing spectacular.  One thing to be warned, the on site underground parking is not fully validated, just discounted.< /text>< pictures>

This is a great place right in the heart of downtown San Jose. The location provides easy access for many people as a meeting and social spot. Very good amenities and as always super nice and professional service from the staff</Text>

<Review>I am a member of this club. Great atmosphere and views on the 17th floor. Nice events & networking. Good food in the Vertex lounge and when you want to experience fine dining you will find outstanding cuisine in the Founder's Room. Some of the staff is long term and you get to know them and they you.< /Review>< Date>

<Review>Extremely good location for a meeting venue in San Jose, good front desk staff, good service in general but some ppl seem to be on a learning curve. The AV tech in the meeting rooms badly needs an upgrade and is of suspect reliability. The last two meetings I have had at this venue have suffered from fundamental failures of AV equipment or equipment preparation. In general the AV setup looks like early 2000s-vintage, and compares negatively to any modern, local office in and around San Jose.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>We had our company Christmas party here. Our staff and their family members really enjoyed the views, the spaciousness of the lounge, dining area, and the seating @ the bar.

The presentation of the appetizers and entree's was very elaborate. Everything was so delicious with tons of flavor. We had a wonderful experience, thank you Silicon Valley Capital Club!<//text>< gmap_id>

A place for a casual drink, or a formal meal. Generally unpretentious, with a business casual dress code. Their events are fantastic, especially New Years Eve. I’ve been a member for a few years.< /review>

Nice views, so so food, and unattended restrooms.

I attend a daylong meeting/private event at this location recently and was somewhat underwhelmed.    The physical location was nice, had a good view of downtown San José, our catered continental breakfast and buffet lunch had good plate presentation and variety (the salmon and the chicken were tough/overcooked) the flavors pretty mild and lacked depth I would hope for in such a facility.  I  used their restroom 3 times during my visit (once at the start of the day, middle, and end) and I was pretty frustrated to see that the sinks were not cleaned up, one was out of soap (someone had even pulled it out as a symbol), urine spray all over the floor (yes, men in general need to learn to use a urinal appropriately) , and just didn’t looked cared for the entire day.  Kind of sad that no employee is responsible for cleaning that entire time or that an employee using it wouldn’t note it and seek out assistance .

Maybe its different most days, but my experience wouldn't have me returning.</text>

Attended the Tree Lighting party as a guest of a member. They were very unorganized, they did not recognize their member as a private club should. The front desk gave instructions and then we went where instructed and waited 20 minutes only to find out they did not accept the drink tickets and the tickets were only for eggnog or bad wine however the front desk daid the tickets were for the full bar. Then we waited in line for food and found no place to sit or even stand at a bar table to eat. Not well planned and not well organized< /review>

Joined here a few years ago. Have generated commissions from referrals emanating from club 10x annual dues. Clubcorp is a class act. Always looking forward to visiting other properties in its collection, whether business/social clubs, country clubs, or health clubs. Some are nicer than others as they tend to buy turnaround assets. SVCC has a nice roof deck, unavailable at most sister locations. Major remodel several years ago. Overall, a bargain compared to Bay Area competitors.<//text>

The atmosphere and decor is sophisticated yet relaxing to watch a sports game on a large screen tv, along with smaller ones sprinkled throughout the club. The Happy Hour menu changes frequently - I'm hoping they will bring back the delicious well-seasoned homemade potato chips and remove the flavorless sliders.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The bartenders made solid drinks, and the fries were perfect (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside), but the snarky waiter was just too much to deal with.</text>

Don't come often, but they're consistently unable to staff for events. 3-4 People at entrance checking tickets, but one(!) bartender + his clueless supervisor making drinks for ~300 ppl. on July 4th Gala.< /review>

Enjoyed the stadium!  Food and drinks way overpriced...eat and drink before you arrive.   In-N-Out 🍔 is only 5 minutes away and free Ice Cream 🍨 from Kinecta bus before the game...get there early.  Delicious 😋. Go Galaxy ⚽️!< /review>

Great stadium with tons of food options (traditional and food trucks). All the seats seem great. Easy-ish in and out parking, but that might be the pandemic limited capacity.< /Text>

Not a soccer guy and didn't see a match, was working, but this place is sick!! So clean and modern with some really cool things to see. Makes me want to come watch a match or boxing sometime</Text>

< review>
My husband found the appointment site last evening and we immediately booked an appointment for 10am today. The location is only 10 miles from us and it only took about 15-20 minutes to get there. It was well organized and the staff was helpful and professional. I rate my experience 5 stars.</review>

Beautiful stadium. My parents got vaccinated there and it was so well organized. They even had doctors and had you wait in a parking lot to see if you had side effects from the vaccine shot.</Text>

<review>We went to an LA Galaxy game and had a great time! We loved the atmosphere and the ticket price was extremely reasonable for where we were sitting! We paid less than $100 each with taxes and fees and were sitting in the second row on the end in the middle of the stadium. It was very easy to find our seats. There were plenty of bathrooms and concessions so we never had to wait in a line. The only thing I wish that they’d made more clear was that you can only bring in a purse of a very small size or a bag made out of clear plastic. We had to run around the stadium to put my purse in a locker.<//review><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

AMAZING PARK!! I went to my first Giants game recently and it did not disappoint. Well it would have been nice had they won but the park itself was BEAUTIFUL! We were able to get club level seats. This was by far the best way to view the game. You can go from your seats to inside and get some great food to eat. They give a great wine pour.<//text>

< review>
If there is a small piece of baseball heaven on earth, it must be Dignity Health Sports Park. Those who love baseball may be amazed by the ferocity of winds on chilly nights. Then there are the one-off events that happen here. Last night was one of them when San Francisco Opera held a simulcast screening of Romeo & Juliet, Shakespeare's tragedy about doomed love. The mix of sports stadium and high culture fits very well. All the seats are good and the concessions were hopping. Next year try to catch this spectacular partnership. It works!</review>

Slick and charming sports stadium for watching soccer, football, and rugby.  Parking is plentiful (a little pricey depending on the event.. thirty dollars for a rugby tournament) and the amenities are modern.  The shaded overhangs are a life saver for the paler skin amongst us!  The playing surface is natural grass and super well maintained; the athletes seemed to be able to move well without slipping.<//Text>

I’m a frontliner  and a American citizen. I thought the goal was to get everyone vaccinated? But you turned me away with appointment and all . I take it as a sign from Jesus Christ I don’t need this in my body... This was more of a control and power situation than a helping and saving situation.</Review></record>

Great ballpark!  Parking is tough (and expensive) but that's public parking. Not the stadium. All types of Bay Area food choices. Great beers and other offerings. Neat stadium, downtown, right up against the water!  Picturesque as the lights come on and the sun sets. Even the cheap seats are great. Come see a game here!<//text>

< review>
We had a great experience at this stadium for a LA Galaxy night game in April 2019. The field was in pristine condition, the General Admission seats were a good view and comfortable and the stadium was clean. We did wish there were more food options but it did not subtract from the experience. Getting out of the stadium parking lot after the game was not too bad.<//review>

Parking is $20 depending on event, food and beer over priced as usual. So liquor up before entering the place. I went to a soccer event and it was cool, nice views as well. I recommend it, you'll enjoy it here.</Text>< pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Don't miss this baseball tour when visiting, if you are a fan or not. The stadium is newer and nicely set up for a game. The view of the bay is stunning!  The tour includes suites, locker rooms, museum like areas, and where the officials sit to watch the replays. The Giants have a lot of history in wins, and the championship rings are on display. Our guide was a home grown boy, and the ultimate fan who was way beyond retirement. He knew so much, and was a delight to listen to. Drive around to find free parking. Afterward, we had lunch across the street at The Polo Grounds.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is an amazing place to see a Charger game. We went to see the Steelers take on the Chargers and I’ll tell you based on the fact that it’s a much smaller stadium in comparison to other NFL stadiums there’s not a bad seat in the house. All the vendors we friendly and all the booths we new and well kept. I would do it again and recommend anyone who wants to enjoy the NFL up close and personal to grab a seat and enjoy!</text>

I was thinking that place is for soccer game. It's good for boxing game as well though a little too hot in a day time. The stadium has very strict policy for bags. Better make sure before you go.<//text>

Hands down, the best place to watch an NFL game.  Every seat in the house is close to the field and has a great view, and the outdoor beer garden sports bar type thing inside the gates is probably better than tailgating.  The Chargers should never move from here.</text>

The event venue itself is great. Awesome atmosphere during baseball games. The camera staff does a great job of making game goers feel involved with the entire mood. Baseballs are flying everywhere giving people a chance to catch them. Let's go Giants! Let's go!</review>

My friend has season tickets to the LA wildcat...claws out or up what ever!!! It’s like watching a high school team. A lot of turnovers and fumbles. But they still won?!?! Are they good or was Tampa that bad??? The stadium was nice the staff friendly. As for all events anywhere pricey! Good venue for a concert.<//Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>A nice venue for a sports game.  We watched the LA Sevens rugby matches and it was great.  Not to big so you can actually see the players well.  There are a lot of food stalls which offers not only hotdogs, pizza or hamburgers.  They had benihana, and other delicacies from other countries like Kenyan, fijian and Australian food as there were different teams from other countries.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfC1Hsbpg5N8Jdy48jnv38e59sG1tOhWIkOMRO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0j-Cc96TCLcZbQ-ExB5A7iQO0HvncTxrR3Foa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYq8WvVgD62sEYfvM7kHWmLVzl9T-ZdAdAP-_O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqPnfh2QRR7x5yjVhyY5Qr4711lLMfh70W0_LT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ-A_svCm1H1oZbjRnhssqy2R297VXCw-co5Zy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWpD0Ya9KMFDUoHPjGQmfm4iGXVSPp-jY9WOH9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNs65tOG8LHLIeZo_k2QtJlEUu_a7WSNWyvShkS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHQlfz_nCydmpIxs-OkPdeDkmQdNO48LSk-Q1F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwpvMl9jxaPjr9GRDI8UApBXefLGDCdIk94iXJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWgSghP4VK25hxNwT6BsB6gzHI-O_LUwhM4EF8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyEKM4bUw4_8Nv7RB6S0DBtsTBSf_IZ5nJXZSJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Attended 7/29/18 when the Galaxy played Orlando and won 4-3. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because the beer is overpriced,  but I guess that’s to be expected. The overall fan experience is great and the crowd is energetic. There are a couple of “cheer groups” within the stands that make sure to keep the energy up as they sing and cheer the team on.

We walked from the Hampton Inn a couple blocks away and it’s pedestrian friendly from there. Seats were decently priced and I would attend again for soccer and any other events.<//review>

< Review>
Very cool to go to a Chargers game here. The announcers were not the best. Half the time we couldn't tell what was happening on the field because the announcer didn't tell you. The camera work on the jumbotron was horrible. They were more focused on finding Chargers fans amongst the crowd than showing the play had started on field. The parking is minimum $50 & $100 for tail gating. Wow! Also you CANNOT take in a purse. Check the rules! Only clear bags. We ended up having to walk all the way to our car to put our stuff back because we had purses.</Review>

<time>1565150073933< /time><text>Great to see the venue but book early for the tour if it's on and the stadium isn't booked out for private advert filming, not many signs to highlight the venue and where to go when you arrive. Shop is smaller than thought (not a hyperstore) and had limited stock which was disappointing when the kids wanted a ball or a shirt (only sizes S or XL available at time when we attended). If just visiting there isn't much to see except the David Beckham statue.< /text><name>Mark Pooley<//name>< Rate>

Nice stadium, comfortable seats, easy parking for 20 dlls and all was clean.
The dark side is the price of the food and drinks... Also there is no enough bathrooms, you need to wait until 15 minutes on the half time.<//review>

Been going here for Galaxy games. Good stadium with lots of eating/drinking options and plenty of restrooms. There are really no bad seats in the whole place, so it just depends on how much closer to the field you want to be, what angle, and how much you want to pay. Would recommend checking out a Galaxy game.<//text>

Such a great experience last weekend!! Saw our beloved Broncos win, food was great, the energy from everyone was amazing, when attending a game always plan to arrive early and expect high prices on drinks and food and be patient at the end expecting traffic leaving the parking area. All in all the best experience,  seats were comfortable and we will be back next year!< /review>

Had a great time watching the team, the seats are much closer than the dodger stadium and there were good priced on the huge bacon wrapped hot dog. I believe they let you hangout and bbq while you wait outside. You need a clear backpack though, no big purses allowed.</Review>

<Review>Love this venue. Not too big, not too small. They have lots of food options, and alcohol is available for those who drink even though i dont. Its funny watching and listening to the drunk people at boxing matches acting like they can do better in the ring. LOL!!! Wait til you get punched in the face once by a professional and see if you still talk...<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>As a football (soccer) fan originally from England, my visit to StubHub Center was both intriguing and a different experience. Loved the fan pre-game entertainment including a concert, several food trucks and a good selection of food booths. Prices were expensive but similar to other SoCal venues. Amazed by the high number of female fans and the friendliness of the crowd. Took some time to get out of the car park after the game. Will go to another Galaxy game in the future.<//Review>< Pictures>

What a great location to watch a soccer game. Small enough to make you feel like a part of the action on the field. Staff is friendly, easy going and I always feel safe here.<//Text>

love it, all that over priced unhealthy food, and super fun with great games, could be more visitors, yes I enjoy my sins and the last game was a blast! UCLA VS. USC. Awesome. Thanks for the entertainment. At least visitors in a 27K stadium.< /Text>

<review>First time to this stadium, parking was a little interesting but security and parking attendants made it clear on where to park. The stadium is on the smaller size but that is one of the best perks about watching a professional game here. Plenty of vendor stands, bathrooms were clean. Depending on the season, the sun can be extremely hot in the non covered section. Did not have difficulties exiting out of the stadium like other stadiums. Looking forward to return.< /review><user_name>Laren Tan</user_name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFz8QaFm6DiQP6C8GTEBkDqo6Piwq-8J9UCgyK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsU3UB_ET48W5Ba8e-jzK_IUerjHPBIlNZ20JA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm8bfTJLSA6vXhHiFzdj40TVuRLLENusrdux5w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><user_id>111187102773899198906< /user_id><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9</Gmap_id></record>

StubHub is a great place to watch football. We have walked the entire stadium. Every seat seems good for viewing the field.</Text>

I have no idea how this place has good ratings... maybe paid ratings? My experience was horrible. I saw chargers vs. Seahawks game and the seats at this place where cheap plastic small hard seats. The redneck next to me must have been over 300LB and eating 2 bags of peanuts that he kept dropping shells on the ground and my shoes.... I got charged $40 for car parking and $28 for 2 Bud light beers. The seats I had where right under the speakers so the sound of announcement and music was crazy loud... I will never come here again....</text>

Love the stadium itself, love watching LA Galaxy games, but whole thing with purses is absolutely crazy. We had to walk around the stadium to rent a locker for a tiny clutch purse because it was a millimeter bigger than allowed. The parking staff did a poor job, too. We arrived over an hour early, but were almost late to the start of the game.< /review>

<text>Really enjoyed this stadium.  Might sway 30k- 40k.  I’ve only watch football games played here and I really enjoyed the view except when your down in the first 10 rows.  Players and cameras block your view if you sit down that low.  Other than that this place has pretty much what you need for a table game.  Screens are huge and new. Sound is great all around the stadium.  I highly recommend a vist to this place.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Nice small Stadium, when i say small i man just 27k people how fit in here. The atmosphere was amazing during LA FC against LA Galaxy. The whole time it went from right to left and then in the opposite direction. But only 4 Stars because when we were at the row from the security my wife were not allowed to take a small bag into the Stadium even nothing was in there. So we had to walk back to the car and had to go back in line. So we missed the first 15 min. so Plan 2.5 hours for finding a parking lot, go through the security and finding the seat.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

Dignity Health Sports Park was wonderful.  My brother and I went there to see the Packers play the Chargers in November of 2019.  The weather was sunny and beautiful which probably makes my memory of Dignity Health Sports Park even better.  Sean Fuerstenberg (from Milwaukee area).<//Text>

Love this stadium, there are no bad seats no matter where you sit! Parking is a little expensive @ $25 but you can park across the street for $10 bucks, short walk. Us won both games we went to see so that made it even better!<//text>

First time to this stadium, parking was a little interesting but security and parking attendants made it clear on where to park. The stadium is on the smaller size but that is one of the best perks about watching a professional game here. Plenty of vendor stands, bathrooms were clean. Depending on the season, the sun can be extremely hot in the non covered section. Did not have difficulties exiting out of the stadium like other stadiums. Looking forward to return.< /text>

Great venue. I went there for a boxing event. It dies get cold so be prepared to bring a blanket and dress warm as you will be exposed to the elements. They do not allow purses so leave them in the car.< /review>

<Text>I always go here for LA Galaxy games,  it's a great stadium. View from everywhere is good. It's clean, they let you bring in your own snacks & water,  etc. - don't force you to buy overpriced snacks from them. Usually ticket prices are reasonable as well<//Text></record>

<text>3.5 star review.  We did not get any drinks or food and can't review that.

Positives: The stadium was clean, no bad seat in the place to see the game (except the sun in our faces), security was significant and attentive, fans weren't too rowdy (XFL game).

Things I'd change: The sound system was really loud, and we aren't grumpy quiet people.  Also, the parking was weird - lot 16 is isolated, down the street and around the corner.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>Great stadium. Almost all seats are perfect viewing seats, no nosebleed. I suggest take a Lyft or Uber cuz parking is high.  Theres a free shuttle that picks up from the Metro station off Del Amo and Sta Fe. 2 hrs before and after game start/end.< /review>< gmapID>

I do very much like this Stadium. It is soon to be replaced by the new Stadium in Inglewood next to the Forum but this one will always be a good choice to go to...enough space to walk around (compared to Coliseum anyway) also a Tennis courts and Velodrome are available. Now if we can only figure out a good name for it!!<//Text>

Very clean and fun stadium. Three of the ushers I asked for help did not actually read my tickets carefully and directed me into general seating 116 to 127 despite the fact my ticket read 105 section. Isn't this their ONLY job? Thankfully, all of the scores by Galaxy were right in front of us! At half time, we hooked up with our team back in 105.< /review>

Love the stadium itself, love watching LA Galaxy games, but whole thing with purses is absolutely crazy. We had to walk around the stadium to rent a locker for a tiny clutch purse because it was a millimeter bigger than allowed. The parking staff did a poor job, too. We arrived over an hour early, but were almost late to the start of the game.<//review>

I always go here for LA Galaxy games,  it's a great stadium. View from everywhere is good. It's clean, they let you bring in your own snacks & water,  etc. - don't force you to buy overpriced snacks from them. Usually ticket prices are reasonable as well</Text>

Sat in section 234, and a great view of the whole field.  The fan experience was pretty good other then paying a premium for the seats.  It felt like the Chargers are trying to make up for missing revenue because they are  short about 40,000 seats.</Text>< Pics>

Went here to see the Raiders play the Chargers, just my son and me. Even though we lost we had the time of our life. Got there around 8:30 am and there was already a line of cars waiting to get into the parking lot that opened at 9am. We walked around and met lots of cool people out having fun with their hooked up low riders and badass trucks. Gates opened to the stadium at 10am. We got in and went straight to the players tunnel.  We got autographs from Mark Davis, Rodger Goodell, John Gruden,  Derrick Carr, and a bunch of other coaches and players. The atmosphere was super cool. No problems or fights.  Lots of cops and security.  Can't wait to do it again next yr<//Text>

Easy in and out of both the parking lot and the stadium. It's on the small side for a sports park so not a bad seat in all the stadium. Food, drink and beer prices are a complete RIP off.....but on par with the other stadium rip off prices. Staff really friendly too.</review>

As an LA Wildcats season ticket holder, I've been so impressed with this stadium and its staff. Every seat in the house is a good seat! Reasonable parking rates, tailgating, a good variety of food and drink choices.< /Review>

<text>Loved seeing the LA Wildcats game! So easy to park and enter the event.   Staff was very friendly.  Lots of concessions open as well as bathrooms.  We never had to wait in line.  Great experience.< /text><Name>Jaime Schaffer<//Name>< gmap_id>

Pretty average stadium.  I definitely don't drive there,  parking is hectic and expensive for area (guess all stadiums are)  Bring your own water,  don't forget only clear bags allowed.  📓🖋</Text>

We had a great time the only thing I would add is we got there early and they have you park far from the place I think if you are early they should have you park closer and people coming in late park in the parking lots that are closer to the street it just doesn't make any sense that you get there early and you walk got to walk about a mile to the stadium.< /Review>

StubHub is an awesome place to view a game, especially an NFL game of the Chargers. With only 28,000 seats if you make it in, there's not a bad view. Easy in to the game. Parking was 20$ and not a long walk to the stadium. If you sit in the end zone, your not sitting in an actual assigned seat. You will be sitting on bleachers that have a number painted on the back rest that isn't really assigned. You will be fighting for your space especially if large men over 300 pounds sit in your aisle. They will not move over and space will be tough to come by. I wish you the best as you navigate through that.</Review>

Beautiful arena for football games. This stadium is very nice and small. There is lota of plantations. The only bad about this place is that the ticketa for all the charger games are horrible and the parking is horribly priced.< /review>

If you are on the visitors side you are baked in the sun the entire game making it difficult to see the action on the field. Parking rates are ridiculous but it was easy to get to and plenty of parking.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>How easy is this place! Great parking (expensive), awesome view seats everywhere (expensive) and a fantastic food selection (expensive).  What I was most surprised about was how quickly we got in and out of the stadium. The game was no-bueno but it was still a really fun event and friendly crowd.</Review><userid>102194027949946058301</userid>< username>

A great family friendly stadium, access to the stadium is easy from the 405. Parking can take a long time (30+ minutes) if you arrive shortly before a game. Food is kind of expensive for what you get, but no more expensive than what other stadiums offer. The facilities (bathrooms, stores, etc.) are well kept and clean.<//Review>

<Review>Great place to watch the many soccer games that take place here. The seats were alright and comfortable enough to focus on the game. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star review is because of the price of the snacks and beverages. I know, every stadium has it's own food and prices but compared to others in the area like the Dodger stadium and the Angel stadium the prices were pretty steep here. $20 for beer and a hot dog? Not today.</Review><time>1526751190266<//time><response>None< /response>< user>

Clean stadium, parking is expensive regardless of how close you park. There is a clear bag policy for all events held here, look it up before visiting for a gathering or you'll be running back to your cars (which can sometimes be far!)<//Review>

Went here to see the Raiders play the Chargers, just my son and me. Even though we lost we had the time of our life. Got there around 8:30 am and there was already a line of cars waiting to get into the parking lot that opened at 9am. We walked around and met lots of cool people out having fun with their hooked up low riders and badass trucks. Gates opened to the stadium at 10am. We got in and went straight to the players tunnel.  We got autographs from Mark Davis, Rodger Goodell, John Gruden,  Derrick Carr, and a bunch of other coaches and players. The atmosphere was super cool. No problems or fights.  Lots of cops and security.  Can't wait to do it again next yr</review>

It's bittersweet that the Chargers are moving. Bitter because it's the stadium where they beat the Packers, sweet because it's a bigger stadium.< /Text>

It is good. The Galaxy won the soccer game. It seems that DHSP  is only interested in extracting as much cash from my wallet as possible. Parking $20 two beers $27 and a very anemic fireworks show. If the Galaxy lost this would be 2 stars.<//review>

Easy to find and off the freeway. Lots of parking but getting out can be hassle. Stadium is small but guarantees a good view from any seat.<//Text>

<text>The best place to see a NFL game. There are no bad seats in the house. The only sad thing is that the Chargers dont have a large fan base. 90% of the fans were Raider fans when we were there. Showing my 11 year old son tailgating was great. I enjoyed it so must I bought 2 season tickets. My son and I will enjoy going to this great venue next season.< /text><GmapID>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9< /GmapID>< resp>

A monkey can run a place better than these bums.  The parking is horrible to get in and out and they're clueless about traffic patterns before and after a game.  I've been to events with 100K plus that get traffic in and out faster than the 26K here.  They tarped off seats in the stadium and then harassed us about standing up.  A woman told my daughter we'd have to sit down and she said, "Where?"< /review>

Great place to see a soccer match or football game, even the nose bleeder seats have an excellent view if the field. There's plenty of parking and security.  The stadium is also in a perfect location, not too far from Orange county and central Los Angeles.< /review>

Great view of the field from any seats in the stadium and nice eateries along the walkways. Bathrooms were even nice and well maintained. Overall a great experience and will go again if something I like is there.</review>< pictures>

The worst sound quality at any venue. Ruined the Weenie Roast because of the poor audio. The highs drowned out the vocals and only the stage speakers were on. It sounded like a million miles away like a portable speaker was playing.</text>

I recently went for the chargers game woot woot! And this place if over all very nice clean restrooms and they have security and staff located at every direction you turn. The atmosphere is very friendly and they have top security and even the bomb squad with everything going on, my family and we felt secure and we had a good time. They also have a clear bag policy where they only allow clear purse, hand bag, and back packs inside the stadium!!!😊<//text>

This is in quite a random location, but there was hardly any traffic and the stadium is immaculate. I watched the LA Galaxy play and there was a live band, unique food vendors, wonderful staff and great seats. This is a very clean stadium and parking was a breeze. I would recommend the free shuttle for seniors or those with disabilities because the main lot is a 7 minute walk away!<//Text>

The staff was kind and helpful, but not very informed as to how to access digital tickets. I had a little hiccup when the AXS app didn't show I purchased the tickets. The answer was simple enough, but it took a while for the employee to find the solution which eventually came from a supervisor.  Other than that the staff was nice and helpful, the prices for food and drinks were as outrageously priced as expected.

A little tip:  Bring a clear bag for your belongings as purses are not allowed into the park.</text>< response>

<text>Nice place to watch soccer,too small for football. Restrooms are too small. Chargers do not belong in Los Angeles and need to go back to San Diego. I love the city of San Diego and I enjoyed going every year. The Rams own the city of LA, this is thier home!</text>< Pictures>

Aside from what’s on the pitch, Banc of California, Ross bowl stadium experience was much better.

Clearly the people running this place doesn’t care about it because the experience hasn’t change from years.</text>< user_name>

The park is beautiful  and games are fun. The atmosphere is electric.  However, don't drive.  Uber or use public transportation instead.  Traffic around the area is a nightmare  and parking is pricey.<//text>

OK, OK, OK, so I've only been here a few times (probably 2) but I have to say, the way that this stadium is laid out, is perfect. You wanna watch a game here? Go for it. Tickets may be pricy, but in the end, it's easily worth it. Would recommend bringing $50 for food, but what can you do about that?< /Review>

One of the biggest rip-offs in sports venues. The cocktails are outrageously priced and the booze is of the lowest quality. You can barely taste the tequila in the margaritas. The wine comes in plastic containers, and it is a poor quality.<//text>

<Text>Went here for a Chargers game. It was easily the most relaxed stadium experience I have had. The location is near many major freeways. Parking was a breeze. The place is very clean. They had reasonably priced beer and food options both inside and outside the stadium. Every seat has good sight lines. It was all around a fantastic game day experience and I would most definitely return.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Each member provided poor directions, pointing to a direction that lead to another attendy that lacked customer service after I requested to be escorted. Adequate training on visitor site locations and customer service solutions, escorts, and posting for special events.</review></record></dataset><record>

Dinner in the club was great. Went back for cookies and brownies at halftime - they picked them up so the focus would be on the cake. Huh? Made no sense. People want choices for dessert and paid a lot of money for said choice. That was disappointing.  Know for next time to stock up on cookies and brownies before the game.<//text>

Was in town for USA  v. Korea and this placed rocked!  The stadium reminds me of Toyota Park back home so that was cool. Place was clean and the bathroom were clean too.  Sat with the American Outlaws and that was cool.  Had a great time and I never exited a parking lot so fast in my life. Super impressive!< /Text>

<Text>I don’t travel south much. We ended up going to Carson for a Galaxy soccer match and we had a blast! Having never been to a soccer match before we barely knew what was going on in the game. But had so much fun attempting at getting involved and learning as we watched. Cheap beer and food made this night unforgettable. Another amazing evening that definitely surprised our expectations.<//Text>< Pics>

Great soccer venue. Let us in to handicapped parking without a placard because I have trouble walking very far. Major problem is no clock visible during stoppage time.<//Review>

<Text>I'm giving this a 2 star rating because the parking is so poorly done there. It took us 45 minutes to get into the parking lot and they charged us $20 to park way out in one of the outer parking lots so we were late getting into the game. They also should post how much the parking is so people are ready to pay and it might go a little bit faster. It was utter chaos and I felt very bad watching two different people who had a hard time walking all that way to the stadium. They should offer a shuttle service for some of the people. Once we were inside it was a great experience and we enjoyed ourselves.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Bag rules change everytime we walk through the security line.. today, we had this nasty security guard who wanted to control lives of others. My makeup bag didn't exactly fit the blue line...  I've been coming through the gate with the same bag for last 2 years..<//review>

This is in quite a random location, but there was hardly any traffic and the stadium is immaculate. I watched the LA Galaxy play and there was a live band, unique food vendors, wonderful staff and great seats. This is a very clean stadium and parking was a breeze. I would recommend the free shuttle for seniors or those with disabilities because the main lot is a 7 minute walk away!</Review>

LA...
Galaxy...

Love that they brought back tailgating, and considering you're in Carson... Not a bad facility. Clean, close by, and comfortable.

Just wish the parking Police would do a better job at arresting dope smoking in the parking lot... It's difficult enough to bring a family to an event when people are passing it around...

Otherwise, great soccer venue!< /Text>

That's right no buyer protection program here folks good luck on getting your money back soon or in general. Overall this place is perfect for any occasion. Plenty of parking you feel safe the grounds are very secure and clean ample parking. The people here are nice but anywhere else you will find a duck in the crowd. The restrooms are above average. ￼</review>

Small stadium that is easy to walk around. Great sphere with the supporters and nice staff. Only you have to be aware of the restrictions they have with what you can bring into the stadium, you can bring a very small handbag with you and no water bottles etc. you'll have to buy that once you're inside.< /Text>

<Text>I saw a Galaxy game the other weekend at the StubHub Center and I was impressed with how much it has been built up in the last couple of years.  I get seats in one of the supporters areas and they have made a whole full service bar next to my seats.  They have more restaurants than they used to have.  Bathrooms are close by everywhere and clean.  The lines weren't that long even though the stadium was packed.  The StubHub Center allows tailgating in some areas of the parking lot so find a seat on some grass and drink up!< /Text>< date>

Lifetime Charger fan and former season ticket holder here... I loved the venue! Yes, parking is expensive, but seriously, with only 27000 seats, it's an incredible experience to see an NFL game in such a compact and intimate setting. Every seat is a good seat and closer to the action than you can imagine!<//review>

<Review>Great event center, forewarned on the parking tho. For any event EXCEPT CHARGERS GAMES, they do not care so much about you parking in the residential area nearby. Just be curtious to the residents living there that actually want to park in front of their own homes, so don't be a dick and be loud and leave trash etc etc. But for chargers games, police patrol regularly EVERY HOUR and give out LOTS OF TICKETS to those that don't have residential passes.<//Review></record>

Great sporting venue, even if your favorite team is the bills and they get killed by the chargers. Easy parking and traffic isn't too bad around the stadium. The fly over before the game was awesome as well!<//Text>

Great Stadium / Venue for concerts! Cheap Parking best food in California for a stadium / venue and I have been to many venues. I went to see wango tango and the venue was amazing you could view the event live while sitting or getting food on TV's located everywhere in the venue. This is probably one of my top 5 venues in California. I highly recommend this venue and wango tango.< /Text>

Paid $100 for parking,which we didn't mind but then the lady who took the money directed us to go to the handicap area. Friend was driving his dad's truck and happened to have a handicap placard so I really can't blame her for directing us there. Parked, then the cops pulled up and surrounded the vehicle. The woman cop asked my friend if the handicap placard was registered to him. He said no,it was in his father's name. She asked a few more questions then proceeded to write him a ticket. He explained that the lady had directed him there to park but she wrote it anyways. While she proceeded to write the ticket, the cops continue to circle the vehicle like we had something to hide. They had already blocked us in and it was a simple misunderstanding but they made us feel uncomfortable.

Finally we we're dismissed and told to park somewhere else. The security had directed us to go a certain way, but not even 5 seconds after telling us where to go, the same guy, for some reason tells us we aren't allowed to go that way. I get into a back and fourth with him asking him where we need to go.

He could tell I was irritated because he had wintessed my friend receiving a ticket so he proceeded to lecture me about how he understands that I'm frustrated because we just got a ticket but I need to calm down. So we were issued a ticket and told not to go in a direction we we're directed to go to by the same person. It's your job to point us in the right direction and you're doing a poor job at it. Then we finally break free from his lecture and was instructed to park by a different guy. As soon as we we're show where to park, we park.then the guy who instructed us to park tells us that we couldn't park there. We exchanged a few words with the guy then we're told we're to park.
Once in the park, the experience wasn't bad. Every seat is pretty much a good seat. There was an obnoxious girl behind us that eventually threw up on my cousin's sweater and my brothers shoes. Luckily he wasn't wearing it when she did.<//Text>

I visited this place few years ago. Since then their policy has been completely changed: no more smoking areas, no reentry, no drinks you can bring in, and plenty of more "no-no-no". I was not even permitted to pickup a prescription medicine I forgot in my car (reentry - no!).
Really disappointed. Will never come back.</review>

<Review>The Sub Hub center is a great, modern, venue for field sports like Soccer and (now) Football. It is a small arena that is more intimate and engaging than other stadiums in the Los Angeles area such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl. It does, as a result, have a much smaller capacity and less of a heritage.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I enjoyed my first NFL game here today!!! My only complaint is the biased security team that harassed a fan of the opposing team. It was wrong that you interrupted our experience with your nonsense! You were far more of a disturbance. It's a football game, people are there to cheer and have fun. They paid for the ticket, let them enjoy themselves! Back off! Other than that... Great experience.</review>

<Text>Rude people working here. Overpriced food and exaggerated bag checks. I really liked the boxing event tho, that's why I give it  a star, everything else the seats and everything else is whack. I'd rather go to banc of California stadium a lot nicer, and friendly staff over there. I'm never coming here for a soccer event ever again, this experience makes me hate LA GALAXY<//Text>< pics>

<Review>My favorite place to visit. The Velo Sports Center is my favorite attraction, but there's also great soccer. And there's a fitness course that you can run/walk and stop at the stations to do strength exercises. There's something for everyone.</Review>< date>

I love going there with my kids to watch LA Galaxy play. Great family atmosphere. Why three stars? Because on my last visit (to watch LA Galaxy two) I was charged $20 for parking. This was because I was directed to park in the section that was for a different event being hosted on the same night (boxing match) instead of being asked which event I was there for. Very disappointing.<//review>

It is a cool place where u get to see the LA Galaxy plus other teams. Also their are separate soccer courses.  The only problem is after the game there is traffic but that's with every stadium.< /Text>< rate>

This is so clean and it's super easy to find your seats. The employees are friendly. Every seat is a good seat. Watching the Galaxy is always fun especially in section 138 with the Los Angeles Riot Squad.< /Text>

Great soccer venue. Every seat is a good seat.  Only issue are concession prices are ridiculously expensive and the workers are slow and incompetent. So if you don't need to eat or drink it's 5 stars.< /Review>

Just bought tickets from StubHub realized I made a mistake on dates called within 5 minutes of mistake and they told I'm an owner of the tickets but they'll relist them and then advised for me to sell them for about 40% of what I paid for them.......Have a son who loves baseball just got back to the states from doing a tour in Iraq and will be home Friday for a 2 week leave and wanted to go to Sundays game but I bought the tickets to Thursday's game. This was my 1st attempt to use this provider for tickets and not a very satisfied customer to say the least!!!!</review>

<Text>Watched a Los Angeles Chargers game vs New Orleans Saints. Nice facility to watch football games. Not a bad seat anywhere very close and intimate. Only down side are the overpriced concessions including alcohol. Also Stub Hub was charging $100 for tailgating parking which is outrageous considering this is a preseason game.< /Text>< Date>

Fantastic venue with multiple stages however if you have the better seats on the floor by the stages you will have to do a lot of climbing and descending stairs which is weird and the food is fantastic with big servings so you get what you pay for but it's not easy if you're handicapped!
Very clean friendly staff it's wonderful but the only reason not 5 stars is because it is not meant for anybody with a physical disability when you get the better seats close all the food is it the top< /Text>

This past Saturday, I hit up the International Champions Cup match with Leicester City v. PSG.  I was so amazed of the renovations to the stadium.  More food options, added bars and additional seating ares to hang out.  All changes for the better.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>The stadium is well managed and maintained. I've had great experiances here. Best feature has got to be the seating. The multiple times Ive been here, i haven't had a bad seat yet. All seats are awesome. Biggest detractor is the pricing of concessions, which is universal at pro sporting events.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9< /gmapID><UserId.>111523260664367592663</UserId.>< Resp>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Professionally​ run business. The staff is hard working, the venue is always kept clean and well maintained. Security it's tight. There's a mix of event security, LA County Sherff Deputy, and State University Police on site during large sporting and concert events.  Parking is pricey, the roads in campus need improving to handle the large volume of traffic.  It will be interesting to see how things work out when the LA Chargers start playing there.< /Review>< pictures>

Paid $100 for parking,which we didn't mind but then the lady who took the money directed us to go to the handicap area. Friend was driving his dad's truck and happened to have a handicap placard so I really can't blame her for directing us there. Parked, then the cops pulled up and surrounded the vehicle. The woman cop asked my friend if the handicap placard was registered to him. He said no,it was in his father's name. She asked a few more questions then proceeded to write him a ticket. He explained that the lady had directed him there to park but she wrote it anyways. While she proceeded to write the ticket, the cops continue to circle the vehicle like we had something to hide. They had already blocked us in and it was a simple misunderstanding but they made us feel uncomfortable.

Finally we we're dismissed and told to park somewhere else. The security had directed us to go a certain way, but not even 5 seconds after telling us where to go, the same guy, for some reason tells us we aren't allowed to go that way. I get into a back and fourth with him asking him where we need to go.

He could tell I was irritated because he had wintessed my friend receiving a ticket so he proceeded to lecture me about how he understands that I'm frustrated because we just got a ticket but I need to calm down. So we were issued a ticket and told not to go in a direction we we're directed to go to by the same person. It's your job to point us in the right direction and you're doing a poor job at it. Then we finally break free from his lecture and was instructed to park by a different guy. As soon as we we're show where to park, we park.then the guy who instructed us to park tells us that we couldn't park there. We exchanged a few words with the guy then we're told we're to park.
Once in the park, the experience wasn't bad. Every seat is pretty much a good seat. There was an obnoxious girl behind us that eventually threw up on my cousin's sweater and my brothers shoes. Luckily he wasn't wearing it when she did.</review>

Easy parking, clean and small stadium, great place to watch soccer. Feels a bit semi-pro for an NFL team. Men's room lines are unusually long (but no worse than women's room lines).</Review>

Great stadium. Family friendly atmosphere with plenty of (pricey) food and drink options inside, Stadium is a bit isolated all the way out in Carson so if you’re coming from the Westside, expect up to an hour’s crawl down the 405!< /Text>

<Review>Recently attended Arsenal vs Bayern Munich, whilst the game and the stadium was fine I lost my coat and with it my passport. It was left at my seat and when phoning up to speak with lost and found the level of service, care, understanding or any ounce of sympathy was completely lacking. They clearly dont have a system in place that is rigorous enough to be hosting such large events, being passed on to one person after another and not really trying to provide any level of support or help. They literally couldnt have cared less. Constant phone calls and they took my number 4 times, clearly not recording or logging anything. Good luck if anything unfortunate such as this happens to you on a visit as quite clearly they are either not doing their jobs or something esle is going on. PASSPORTS DO NOT JUST DISAPPEAR!...< /Review>< pics>

This place has a lot of energy. The food is on the pricey side and the parking is $60 in the sticks or $100 closer to the venue. You'll notice a lot of people walking from other neighborhoods to avoid parking in the parking lots.< /review>

Stub Hub will not be the home of the Chargers for long. However, as an NFL fan if you can get your hands on tickets you want to take advantage of it if you can. There's not a bad seat in the entire stadium of 28,000. $40 for parking. Not bad. Easy entrance into parking and fairly easy exit out. 1 of the best experiences in this regard. My Niners out numbered the Chargers so that was cool to see. My only complaints were the pot smoke was everywhere and in the heat it can be tough to breathe. That and the seats in the end zone are on bleachers. The #'s aren't very far apart and you will come across space issues if there is large men or women in the same row as you. Plenty of drunks and trash talkers around but that is to be expected.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd352cb6fcd333:0x4cdeacdd33be75e9<//Gmap_id></record>

I have season tickets to the LA Galaxy. So I come here quite a few times each season. The stadium is really nice. However they need to get some Wi-Fi. I attend a lot of sporting events and almost every stadium I go to has Wi-Fi except this one.< /text>

<Text>It's ok.

The crowd is average

The food is below average

The parking is expensive

The supporters are fairly weak

Ambience here for the home team seems below average.

The kicker is everyone wearing jerseys advertising for herbalife the MLM company. Lol

Go to the other soccer stadium for a better time

I'm not a fan of either la team as in a transplanted NYer<//Text>< name>

<Response>None</Response><Review>First time going to an event here other than the CrossFit Games. Attended Man U v. Galaxy. Plan ahead for their Clear Bag Policy. I didn't...during the CF Games I brought in a toddler sized backpack. Lucky for me I had a zip lock in my emergency bag in the truck. Drinks are EXPENSIVE. $12 for a beer $4.50 for a 12 oz water and $5.50 for a soda. Luckily soccer games don't last long. Love the facility though..state of the art and clean.</Review>< userid>

<Text>The stadium wasn't the issue - it's a nice venue BUT THE PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE.  We had to park .925 of a mile away.  How do I know it was .925?  Well.... that's the other issue.

The Stub Hub Center has a CLEAR PURSE POLICY.  What's that you ask?  Well, you can't take a regular purse into the stadium - it has to be transparent and no larger than the size they illustrate on the notices they have posted.... AT THE ENTRANCE.

There's nothing about the policy on the STUB HUB website or when you log into your account.  Most venues have policies on the stadium site but if the Stub Hub Center has it - it's hidden.  There's no mention of it on the e- ticket, or the confirmation e-mail.  They don't post it on signs in the parking lot or on the long long journey FROM the parking lot..... and if you think it would be fairly simple to hand out a little slip pf paper when they take your 20 bucks for parking YOU ARE WRONG.

So, I had to walk to the stadium - then back to the car - then back to the stadium - and then back to the car after the game.  A total of 3.7 miles.
Me and a bunch of other really annoyed women who missed most of the first half of the game.

I'm all about accountability and fine with security policies but when you have an unusual restriction POST IT!!!

<review>Food is expensive but it's obvious it would be expensive because of the nature of stadium food services. Regardless, the vibe that the stadium gives off during each sports match is fascinating.<//review>< pictures>

I liked it for the event itself but didn't like the environment around me saw a guy that was already drunk but somehow went to go get more beer like how did they even let you get more? He clearly couldn't hold himself up anymore and the food there is too over priced.</text>

$20 to park, $9 for a bottle of water. This place definitely has the art of ripping people off down to a T. The seats were pretty comfortable though as far as stadium seating goes. Prices definitely turned me off of returning though. (However if you're not a broke ass college kid attending a huge game and money isn't a factor, than you'll do fine!)< /Text>

<Text>The stadium wasn't the issue - it's a nice venue BUT THE PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE.  We had to park .925 of a mile away.  How do I know it was .925?  Well.... that's the other issue.

The Stub Hub Center has a CLEAR PURSE POLICY.  What's that you ask?  Well, you can't take a regular purse into the stadium - it has to be transparent and no larger than the size they illustrate on the notices they have posted.... AT THE ENTRANCE.

There's nothing about the policy on the STUB HUB website or when you log into your account.  Most venues have policies on the stadium site but if the Stub Hub Center has it - it's hidden.  There's no mention of it on the e- ticket, or the confirmation e-mail.  They don't post it on signs in the parking lot or on the long long journey FROM the parking lot..... and if you think it would be fairly simple to hand out a little slip pf paper when they take your 20 bucks for parking YOU ARE WRONG.

So, I had to walk to the stadium - then back to the car - then back to the stadium - and then back to the car after the game.  A total of 3.7 miles.
Me and a bunch of other really annoyed women who missed most of the first half of the game.

I'm all about accountability and fine with security policies but when you have an unusual restriction POST IT!!!

There isn’t a bad seat in the house, but the crowd is mixed about 50/50 for the home and away teams, so if you are a chargers fan you may be disappointed from being surrounded by so many away fans.</review><response>None<//response>< Date>

<Review>Simply the best place to watch your favorite team beat the chargers at the lowest price. We watched the Eagles beat the tar out of them. A sea of green inside the stadium and Philly cheese steaks all throughout the tailgate party.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>Parking is a joke and no one can tell you where you are supposed to go. Have they never heard of walkie talkies? Run by idiots. Won't be going there again. I'm not a lafc fan but my experience was getting into the stadium was way easier.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I have season tickets to the LA Galaxy. So I come here quite a few times each season. The stadium is really nice. However they need to get some Wi-Fi. I attend a lot of sporting events and almost every stadium I go to has Wi-Fi except this one.< /review>

Expensive food. The design for cars getting into the lot is absurd, so we parked about a mile away, at a strip mall. When we walked in, we saw the reason that  none of the cars were going in is because the cars  were waiting for pedestrians. Either a traffic light or pedestrian bridge could have  taken care of that problem. I then had to go back to the car, because they wouldn't allow my wife's purse in. I'm wasn't angry, just a little surprised. It's been a long while since I've been to any stadium.< /Review>< Pictures>

There is no designated ride share areas, you have to cross the street to businesses and causes chaos and congestion.  The employees know nothing.  Parking prices are outrageous.</review>

<Review>Place is huge. Security are sometimes overachievers. Grounds and venues are well kept. Heaps of parking.

There's a donut shop across the street from the entrance that has pretty good cronuts.</Review>< Pics>

I've been to several purpose-built US soccer stadiums and StubHub is really great. There is more space around the outside of the stadium proper (within the venue) than at either Avaya in San Jose or Toyota Park in Chicago. It also provides a more intimate venue than Redbull Stadium in New Jersey.

The only downside is parking. It's cheap, but can take a while to untangle after the game. Prepare to wait a bit.< /review>

Small concourse kind of crowded. Bench aluminum seats not real seats. Still a good venue to watch a game. Parking prices for football game is way overpriced not worth it to tailgate.</review>

<text>Saw the Chargers play here. Food/beverage prices are typical of these venues, but the size of the stadium is its selling point. It's so small that there is not a bad seat in the house. Our seats were in the last row on the visitor side and I couldnt believe how close we were. Definately a good venue becausenof the closeness. Parking is $40 which in my opinion is ridiculous and only two lots allow tailgating; I think it's because the other lots are in the college campus next to the stadium and they don't want people drinking there. But, again, not a bad seat in the house.< /text><response>None</response><Time>1544388784630<//Time>< userid>

<text>Totally didn't have my tickets.  Put me on hold for 45 minutes for what?  Just to come back and tell me, they're only "brokers", they can't stand behind the people offering the tickets up for sale, and that if I'm lucky, I might get a refund for an undetermined amount in about three or four weeks!!!!  REALLY  Where is the buyer protection?  They don't offer any<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Only one entrance open for graduation. Had to walk a long way, handicapped parking was pointless. Crazy hot day and the cocos sion stands ran out of water.</review>

Good Stadium, bad Experience. - There isn't a bad seat in the place to see a soccer game. However, the confessions are the SLOWEST in the world and the prices are TOO HIGH even for a stadium.  The walks to your car is outrageously long and poorly lit.</Review>

Great venue. However, mgm't has a nonsense policy about not allowing bags unless they are see thru and within a certain size. For those that used ride share be prepared to dish out some more money to store your things for a couple hours.

Post-9/11, it seems that we have accepted living in fear. In Making America Great Again, we have accepted these types of policies that only serve to squeeze consumers out of more of their hard earned money. #JustSayin<//text>

I do not owe you money. Quite the opposite. You owe me money.

I bought 4 tickets from YOU STUBHUB in good faith on the 11th August for $1,154 which I paid imediately. AGAIN I bought them from you and paid YOU not any one else the full amount.

I then did not need one ticket and sold it on YOUR STUBHUB website for 202.50 net of YOUR commission. HOWEVER YOU NEVER PAID ME THE $202.50 EVER

When I went with my family to the Stadium on the 18th August the three electronic tickets that We had bought from STUBHB DID NOT WORK. The ticket office asked us to call you which we did.  I called YOU from outside the stadium and you replaced the tickets with 3 inferior tickets. I then went back to the Barrier with the new tickets and AGAIN the tickets that you STUBHUB had sent to me also DID NOT WORK. Luckily a kind manager at the barrier that had been watching my family suffering from all of this decided at this point to simply open the gate to us even though BOTH sets of tickets that STUBHUB had sold to us were obviously FAKE.

The icing on the cake is that you STUBHUB is now demanding that I pay them ‘back’ the $202.50 THAT YOU STUBHUB DID NOT PAY ME in the first place.

I called the number on the email to explain and was abused by a rude women who told me it was a penalty for selling fake tickets THAT I BOUGHT FROM YOU STUBHUB. Needless to say I will never pay you as I have already paid you $1,154 for 4 fake tickets.

What I will do is absolutely warn everyone of how dishonest StubHub will s through yelp and all other platforms. The public needs to be warned that you are crooks

You will never see another cent from me, my family & friends< /review>

One of the best stadium experiences for the most part.  Would only complain about what they think is craft beer and traffic getting out.< /Review>

Horrible parking, its far away from the entrance and way to expensive
And I don't know what genius decided not to let most bags in now, or what genius wouldn't tell us until the front gate. So it's walk the half mile back to your car or pay 15 dollars for maybe a locker. All because someone got scared of purses... are you kidding me. Can I give 0 stars?< /Review>

Getting into the stadium was easy but paying $100 to park near the stadium is outrageous. I'm not sure if it's like this for every game but for the Oakland Raider game the prices seem to be overwhelming<//Review>

<review>We love the chargers and have traveled all season from San Diego. We enjoy the tailgate with one exception. We understand why the emergency lines need to be there but please be more realistic or offer more spacing. It is ridiculous to expect patrons to park their car, pull out chairs, grill their food and set out bean bag games within one parking space without crossing the emergency line. Also, their security really need to properly identify real threats from those simply having fun. Their priorities are out of wack. Pro? There are beer stands conveniently placed with unique options such a micheladas and food trucks. There's no shortage of bathrooms or portapotties and the smaller more intimate stadium almost makes up for the sub par security.</review>< GmapID>

But I only give it 4 stars because the parking circulation is horrible.  Do yourself a favor and just wait 30 minutes after the game if you drove to the game.  You're not getting out anytime soon.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

There's not a bad seat in the house and the atmosphere is very festive. However, you really feel the pack of the crowd, especially at the concessions and bathroom lines. As long and onerous as the worst, really not enjoyable concessions experience.</Text>

Hit up the Home Depot Center for my first event this weekend, and I've got to say it was a very, very cool venue. It's spread out over a huge lot of land right next to Cal-State Dominguez's campus, and is home to soccer fields (home of the MLS teams), the USTA Training Center, and the only indoor velodrome in the United States, which is the event I went to.

Granted, I haven't been for bigger events, but this weekend the parking was great, security was right there, and the staff inside the stadium was fantastic.

Definitely a great place to catch an event, and I look forward to going back soon!< /Text>

what was a jewel in the LA crown of sports facilities is now just another stadium. The Chargers moved in and StubHub made "improvements" for them. The grassy area under the score board is gone. In its place, empty aluminium seats. Below the grass area was a row of bougainvillea that when in bloom, provided a bright stripe of pink under the green grass area .  Gone. The  once grassy, picnic friendly pre-game area has been cemented over and fenced in for that new prison look. 4 stars because it is still home to the Galaxy but i cant wait for the roomies to get their own place.<//Review>

Stadium is on the smaller side so most seats offer good view of the action. Helpful and friendly staff at Galaxy games.</Review>

Come here often to watch the galaxy games and this stadium wipes out the coliseum, and being that I worked there for several years. I really like this stadium and prefer it over the coliseum.< /Review>

<text>Went here to watch a friend of mine compete in an MMA match.  Parking was expensive as already stated by previous posts.
My problem with the place is that they had no dome.   It was hot and the sun was in my eyes so I could barley see the fight.  Not sure it's the fault of the Stub Hub for this or for the fight promoter having it here.  I will not come here for another fight, at least not during the day time.< /text>< user_name>

Although a bit smaller than what you expect from a major sports venue in So Cal, its just the right size for soccer in the US.  Plenty of parking and vendors.</text>

Stadium is cool and more modern than the home stadium I've gone to (Qualcomm). Due to the size of it, basically any tickets you get are close to the field and you're not getting a nose bleed. However there are some faults, one being that I didn't see anywhere that it was ok to tailgate. That's a must for football games but it seemed to be banned at all parking spots. The second thing is the seats behind the endzone. They were bench seats and that caused some problem when it came to people getting their seats. If you're husky/stalky then it's a bit tight.</text>

Stubhub Center is actually incredibly clean from the bathrooms to the little rest stops with charging station.

What made my experince amazing was of course of the amazing Pit spot we were at. We were able to look directly right under the skirts of the performers and it was AMAZING!

Easy and quick to get in. We took an uber so i don't know about the parking. A lot of toilets and places to buy food and drinks in the stadium. Cold metal benches behind the endzone. They were also wet. Even the cheapest seats were expensive. But we had a great time here watching the chargers win. Quick exit also. But walking to the uber/lyft pickup was stupid. Our uber didn't even originate there. And long line to get out. We met him on the outside of the parkinglot. Prob saved us 40-60 min.</Text>

Horrible experience will never use them again, and I will post this all over my social media. We got our tickets for Bob Seger at the Palace in June. We had 10th row main floor. we had a confirmation number and were told to print tickets off on the 22nd. Night before the concert, only to try and print tickets and find out the confirmation number we were given was no good. Now here we are the night before having to purchase tickets at a higher price and getting seats 9 rows back and off to the right, this sucks. 700 dollars for 2 concert tickets. Maybe that's the way they make more money, very shady business. Never use Stub Hub unless you want to get cheated out of your tickets!</review>

<username>berightback18</username><date>1512773007595< /date><text>Easy and quick to get in. We took an uber so i don't know about the parking. A lot of toilets and places to buy food and drinks in the stadium. Cold metal benches behind the endzone. They were also wet. Even the cheapest seats were expensive. But we had a great time here watching the chargers win. Quick exit also. But walking to the uber/lyft pickup was stupid. Our uber didn't even originate there. And long line to get out. We met him on the outside of the parkinglot. Prob saved us 40-60 min.< /text>< Response>

First Time at Wango Tango!

Stubhub Center is actually incredibly clean from the bathrooms to the little rest stops with charging station.

What made my experince amazing was of course of the amazing Pit spot we were at. We were able to look directly right under the skirts of the performers and it was AMAZING!

def. a must go go !</Review>

my first professional soccer games were the world cup games (semi / final), so i wasn't really sure what to expect from mls games, but my first experience at the stubhub! center turned out to be a fun one!  considering we beat portland timbers  3-1.    reasons:

1)  seats:  there is really no such thing as a bad seat at the stadium, we got nosebleed bleacher seats and they were far from nosebleed.  we got the perfect elevated vantage point of the field and the awning really helped with the scorching hot day.
2)  opening ceremony:  there were firework boxes on the field that shot short distance firework out of them, it was definitely a surprise and delight.
3)  traffic control:  carson police dept were manning the traffic lights and making sure the traffic wasn't backed up and creating chaos, it was easy to get in and out of the stadium.
4)  gift shops:  plenty, but a lot of the popular jerseys ran out in smaller sizes, so if you want la galaxy gears, make sure you hit up the stores early.  i think because the la galaxy won they were offering 30% off tee shirts :)
5)  stadium:  lawn is perfectly manicured, but the grass wasn't lusciously green.  stadium overall was very well maintained and clean.

stadium food were meh, the usual hotdog, burgers, and chips, nothing to write home about though.  we opted out on parking at the stadium, it was $15/vehicle.  i'm looking forward to attending another la galaxy game in the near future :)< /Review>

Wango Tango 2014 Experience.

We had tickets in the 135 section, entrance is the North East gate.
Check-in was a breeze. They checked my bag and then I was good to go.

Seats  were pretty good. Lots of people stood up dancing (I participated) during Maroon 5, Paramore, Calvin Harris, Zedd, and Tiesto. Ed Sheeran was there rocking the guitar. Bummed that we missed One Republic but will be seeing them at Hollywood Bowl in June.

Venue was clean, there are TVs near the concession stands/ restroom area so you don't miss any action while waiting to get food/drinks.

Food selection is limited. We tried the carne asada nachos and was disappointed. The chips were stale and hardly any meat. Taco Bell is better!
They serve beer only, or at least that was all I saw.

Parking was free for this particular event but I hear they charge for other events.</review>

<Review>when you purchase tickets over the phone they have you purchase them on Ticketmaster download to your phone some phones don't accept it I lost my tickets they gave me other tickets cheaper and they will not refund the difference from the price they want to put it in a credit and I prefer my money back it sucks they tell me they're going to put it back into the account and they never do<//Review><Name>Leo Prieto< /Name>< GmapID>

This place is not Baby Friendly you can't take a diaper bag inside if it's not cleared and it could only be 12 in by 6 in. Any other Stadium let you take a diaper bag<//review>

<Time>1579115950413<//Time><Rate>3< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) It was not what I expected. We went to watch a football game to meet and we got many surprises. To start the expensive parking !! $ 100 and you can't park nearby. We leave the car with pa 3 km. We had brought a couple of backpacks with water sunscreen and documents. When arriving at the stadium not for a security person and tells us that we could not enter with the backpacks x security we had to leave them in the lockers that was a truck and left them lying on the grass 😱 with a tag and that is why they charged you $ 20 per backpack 😱. Nowhere were they telling you that you had to carry transparent bags 😡. The game was fine but the dirty horror baths a lot of people a lot of noise. To eat there was little and nothing. I would definitely not go back

No era lo que  esperaba. Fuimos a ver un partido de fútbol americano para conocer y nos llevamos muchas sorpresas. Para comenzar el parking carísimo !! u$s 100 y no podes estacionar cerca. Dejamos el auto con pa 3 km. Habíamos llevado un par de mochilas  con protector solar agua y documentos. Cuando llegando al estadio no para una persona de seguridad y nos dice que no podíamos entrar con las mochilas x seguridad que teníamos que dejarlas en los lockers que era un camión y te las dejaba tiradas en el pasto 😱 con un tag y por eso te cobraban 20 dólares por mochila 😱. En ningún lugar te decían que tenías que llevar bolsos transparentes 😡. El partido estuvo bien pero los baños de terror sucios mucha gente mucho ruido. Para comer había poco y nada. Definitivamente no volvería</Text>< Pics>

<rate>3<//rate><Text>(Translated by Google) It was not what I expected. We went to watch a football game to meet and we got many surprises. To start the expensive parking !! $ 100 and you can't park nearby. We leave the car with pa 3 km. We had brought a couple of backpacks with water sunscreen and documents. When arriving at the stadium not for a security person and tells us that we could not enter with the backpacks x security we had to leave them in the lockers that was a truck and left them lying on the grass 😱 with a tag and that is why they charged you $ 20 per backpack 😱. Nowhere were they telling you that you had to carry transparent bags 😡. The game was fine but the dirty horror baths a lot of people a lot of noise. To eat there was little and nothing. I would definitely not go back

No era lo que  esperaba. Fuimos a ver un partido de fútbol americano para conocer y nos llevamos muchas sorpresas. Para comenzar el parking carísimo !! u$s 100 y no podes estacionar cerca. Dejamos el auto con pa 3 km. Habíamos llevado un par de mochilas  con protector solar agua y documentos. Cuando llegando al estadio no para una persona de seguridad y nos dice que no podíamos entrar con las mochilas x seguridad que teníamos que dejarlas en los lockers que era un camión y te las dejaba tiradas en el pasto 😱 con un tag y por eso te cobraban 20 dólares por mochila 😱. En ningún lugar te decían que tenías que llevar bolsos transparentes 😡. El partido estuvo bien pero los baños de terror sucios mucha gente mucho ruido. Para comer había poco y nada.

(Translated by Google) Very good stadium, everything is very well organized, a lot of security in all aspects.
The atmosphere is purely sporty, the seats very comfortable, good view from any angle you are in.
The parking lot is very large and the access areas to the stadium are strategically located.
It is located in Carson cal. And it's the home of the Galaxy Angels.

Muy buen estadio, todo esta muy bien organizado, mucha seguridad en todos los aspectos.
El ambiente es meramente deportivo, los asientos muy cómodos buena vista de cualquier ángulo en el que te encuentres.
El estacionamiento está muy grande y las áreas de acceso al estadio están estrategicamente hubicadas.
Se encuentra en Carson cal. Y es la casa de los Angeles Galaxy.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The viewing experience is good, the venue sells a lot of food, there is a big parking lot, 20 yuan once, cash, close to the high speed, easy to drive, the bus is not too convenient, but the current level of the team is indeed not as good as LAFC, the fans of the scene The atmosphere is not as good as the LAFC fans.

(Original)
看台观赛体验不错，场地卖吃的也挺多，有大的停车场，20元一次，现金，紧邻高速，开车方便，公交不是太方便，不过球队现在的水平确实不如LAFC，现场球迷的氛围也不如LAFC的球迷组织的好。</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Goods for the Crossfit Games. The area is very big, but very clean. However, the staff was partly wrongly instructed: At certain entrances one was not allowed to take own food and cameras with big lenses, at others already.

(Original)
Waren für die Crossfit Games da. Die Anlage ist sehr gross, aber sehr sauber. Das Personal war jedoch teilweise falsch instruiert: An gewissen Eingängen durfte man eigenes Essen und Kameras mit grossen Objektiven nicht mitnehmen, an anderen schon.< /Review>
