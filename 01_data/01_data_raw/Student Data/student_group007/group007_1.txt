Friendly Staff both at reception and check in with nurse. Helena is so down to earth. She explains, answers questions and never makes me feel hurried because she has other patients. Not to mention the fact that so much has improved with me since I started coming here. Thank you Sleep Health.< /Text>

Dr. Masri  is a very caring doctor who addressed all of my concerns.  He listens very well to my concerns and at the end of the appointment I always feel he really cares about his patients.  He has helped me tremendously in giving me a better nights sleep.  Thank You for your care.< /Text>

Dr Morse cares. If you need extra time to address concerns or questions Dr Morse will take the time. So if they are running late it is no doubt that Dr is caring for another patient the same way he will care for you. Office staff very friendly..< /review>

<Review>Dr. Masri was very communicative and informative, discussing treatment/behavior options including specifically reduction of one or more meds (e.g. Ambien). His focus on identifying and treating any underlying disorder, rather than just medicating for insomnia and apnea, was encouraging.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I thought I was dreaming, but then I remembered that I was being seen for insomnia.  WOW!  After nearly a year, I've found some help in defining an overall plan to overcome my lack of sleep.  Dr. Tony Masri actually explained my problems and possible solutions rather than dictating a treatment plan.  And, he didn't run out the door after 10 minutes.  Dr. Masri deserves a 10, not just 5 stars.< /Review>

Good school. Graduated a year ago, class of 2012. It is great and the teachers are great. 5 different schools in one block because each one has a different point of interest and that is great. Depending what you want to do in life, the right academy can help you with your future goal.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Horrible school... the teachers are so rude. Go figures why the students attitudes are the same. They do not properly tell you what they are teaching nor do they help their students who struggle in the class. For a bunch of professionals who teach, they are pretty ignorant.< /review>< pictures>

Renaissance is the best Academy of all it has more academic classes. Specifically when it comes to leardship, because every year they have 2 blood drives without the help of the other leadership academies<//text>

This is not a dealer, they buy all cars from auction and cover up the negative flaws.  Whatever damage u see is actually more than what you think.  They have mechanics working around the clock to hide the damage to not make it look so bad.  No test drive,  you need to tow it once u buy, plus they will keep asking for u to pay in full and they will ship the vehicle from another state.  If you would like to see how much they raise the price without fixing,. Just Google the vin and u will see the real photos and how much money there making OFF YOU :) SHADY WAY TO DO BUSINESS RIGHT?</review>

<review>came for a test drive with Art (our sale rep.).  Environment was friendly, Art was very helpful and very knowledgeable.  Would definitely buy car here again.  Can't beat the price and services here.  Top of that you have 5 days or 200 miles to return the car should you have want to change your mind.< /review><user_id>116876102021838278070</user_id>< name>

I can't say enough great things about the Sur Motor Cars company! From start to finish, we were treated with respect and kindness and everyone we encountered there made it a great overall experience. We were under a tight budget and had run into a lot of Salvage dealerships/dealers that didn't even come close to treating us with the excellent customer service that we received here.

Must give a particular shout-out to Adam absolutely wonderful customer service! I can't recommend this group more highly, and will certainly be returning anytime I or someone I know is interested in buying a Salvage car. 5 stars and keep up the great work!</text>

<review>Alex was great! Very friendly, informative, and goes out of his way to please his customers. No push sales or pressures at all! Did us a great flavor which made us very happy, we need more salesperson like him! The negotiation process was quiet funny, it's not like we were arguing bargaining or anything, it's all fair and agreeable, I was quiet satisfied with the final price.< /review><user>115409642230362167369<//user>< gmapID>

I'm a student and this company took my money, while feeding lie after lie.
New 5 speed transmission $1500 labor $500
New clutch $400
New door latches and locks and main switch $300 labor $700
Two alignments and suspension adjustments $550
New Intercooler (hole in intercooler) $200
Broken bolt removal in turbo $100
Both Catalytic converters $1100 labor $175
Also had to pay $300 for transportation. The car was a 3 days late.

"GRAND TOTAL $5825 OF COLLEGE TUITION AFTER SELL OF CAR"

So before you think about buying a car from these folks. Ask yourself if you're a mechanic or have thousands of dollars to invest in a car.
I told both salesmen/liars that I was a student and was in need of a car that I could use for the next step in my education. Both salesmen/crooks told me and confirmed that the car was reliable just had a gear missing, and the missing gear could be fixed with a new clutch. Needless to say, the car didn't steer properly. The car wouldn't shift pass third. I give a basic list of parts and labor that I needed to fix the car and get it into operational condition. Do not buy from these individuals it is a chop shop and will put a car together in the cheapest Frankenstein way possible. I'm starting the process of looking into an attorney and CA statutes involved with buying cars from people like this. I have saved every email and text sent. Will move forward with the process. PLEASE DON'T THINK ABOUT BUYING A CAR FROM THIS SAD EXAMPLE OF A BUSINESS.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2caefaada1507:0xe0f39e7ed4a3d852< /GmapID></record>

<date>1619648277651< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Bought 2 cars from this location (Audi A4 and Honda HR-V) and the images are completely different than what I received. It's as if they did EVEN MORE damage to the car after the pictures were taken. The Audi had no damage on the front from the pictures on their site but when I got it the entire front end needed to be replaced in addition there were damages to the front reinforcement bar, braces, brackets, and more. They even hid damages in pictures, the Honda apparently had an alternator that completely broke off the engine and they taped it up with black tape so it couldn't be seen. Also several parts were missing that were on the car in the pictures. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed by how they misrepresented their products on their website. Never buying from these guys again, I feel I've been lied to and cheated.</text>< Pictures>

We just leased two Prius and had a great experience. Sammy was very patient explaining all the features and made us feel like we could call him anytime if we had questions. He was honest and a great communicator.  This is my second experience with Sur Motor Cars. I bought a Scion there in '05 and they couldn't have been more helpful. That's why I came back!<//Text>

<Text>Watch out people! I went to check out the Corvette ZO6 and not only are they asking for a ridiculous amount of money for a wrecked car, but the damages are worse in person than the pictures. Also it appears that parts were taken from the vehicle. You will wind up paying more.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2caefaada1507:0xe0f39e7ed4a3d852< /gmap_id>< name>

Car buying isn't something most people want to do. Its what people tread, probably more than anything.
But I'm glad I was able to get the car I wanted within my budget. It was certainly something I didn't think could really happen. But I'm so glad Walter helped me out from start to finish. He made sure that I left happy. I will certainly consider coming back for future vehicle purchases. Thank you Walter and Sur Motors!!</text>

<Review>Overall very satisfied with my experience at Sur Motors. Went looking at a 2016 Silverado they had for sale and was attended by Walter. Walter was very helpful about the repair process and let me know few places that carry parts for the vehicle. We had several things in common which helped with the overall buying experience. I Left immediate deposit and had my truck couple days later. Great Place overall and crazy amount of inventory they have!</Review><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

<Text>I recently purchased a 2014 BMW 5 series from sur motors, and it was a great transaction. They arranged transportation and the title paperwork quickly. The office staff answered all my questions promptly. The car was exactly as stated in the description. Will gladly shop again in the future. Highly recommended.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>A great experience buying a salvage car  cause of the salesman, Adam  was great! I had found a vehicle online and he contacted me & answered all the questions I had before I came down to see it in person.  Living 350 miles away I wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my time, and Adam saw to that.  He was very friendly and not pushy at all. I would buy another vehicle from him for sure.
Thanks again Adam</Text><Name>Ricardo Delgado<//Name>< pics>

I was so nervous to buy a salvaged car but I'm glad i didn't let that stop me from doing it. The guy that helped me, Jose, made it so easy and i got my car for much less than what i would have at a dealer. It took a little longer because i had to get a few things fixed but it was worth the wait.<//text>

Only positive things to say about my recent 2014 Jeep purchase.  Lessly, Maria, and Jose were all great people to work with and helped me through the transactional process. They quickly answered all my questions via email and/or phone, handled all the necessary transactions and even helped with negotiating and scheduling the vehicle transport.  If your in the market for a "bruised" vehicle, I would highly suggest visiting Sur Motor Cars.<//Review>

I’ve been working with Sur motors for over 8 years. They do an amazing job and always take care of their clients. Shop manager Walter Morales is a beast in their. He goes above and beyond to make sure your car is ready as promised.</Text>

This is an excellent company to do business with and in our past experience we have found them to be very accurate on descriptions of their vehicles. The do work to provide you with any detail you need for a vehicle and also help with parts purchases for those vehicles from their parts inventory. All in all a great place to do business with . They will keep our business.   Thanks Adam!!<//Text>

I just bought my third vehicle from Sur Motors.  It is a lot of work getting these vehicles back together correctly, but the work and ultimate savings are very rewarding.  I would rather buy a low mileage vehicle from Sur and KNOW that it is fixed correctly and runs great, rather than roll the dice at a used car lot.  I have put over 90,000 trouble-free miles on my Jetta purchased from Sur several years ago.  I am looking forward to my next project now.  Leslie at Sur Motors really makes these purchases and subsequent vehicle deliveries an easy process.  Thanks Again!!</text>

I highly recommend Wally at Sur Motors if you want to buy a project car. For 6 years I have personally been going to Wally to buy cars to restore for my family, and I have referred friends who have also bought numerous cars from Wally. I have nothing but good things to say about Wally and my experience with Sur Motors. If you want to drive a late model car and don't want to pay dealer prices there is no better way to do it. When I bought the first car for my wife 6 years ago (2012 Mercedes C250) I had no idea what I was doing, but Wally really helped me. My wife still drives that car, and all my children still drive their cars as well! We have never had a problem with any of the cars or getting them titled. If you're like me, once you buy your first car and restore it you will never buy from a dealer again. If you are skeptical--like I was--just go talk to Wally, he really helped me and I know he will help you too.< /Text>

<resp>None</resp><Text>This is a perfect business. Buying wrecked cars from auctions and selling them to the public that have no access to some auctions. The bad part of this business is the presentation of vehicles. When they receive the vehicles, they Work on them to make them look better than the original accident. In my opinion, they butcher them in order to make them look good. By doing this, some original parts are taken off and not replaced. They weld parts that are broken and hide severe damage areas. I understand the vehicle has been in an accident and I understand I’m buying a wrecked salvage car. But don’t make the illusion of light damage when in reality it’s been severely wrecked. I shouldn’t but I will compare this business to a mortuary. Fix a body to make a good presentation.</Text></record></dataset><record>

yeah these guy's hide the internal stuff make it seem as it is being sold as is but realistically they have people to mickey mouse the exterior to make it seem slightly damaged. Just advise to personally check the vehicle before buying not recommended for online buyers out of the state.</review>

< Review>
This place has a very annoying and nonsense policy that requires the transporter trucks to be in their miniature yard in order for them to release the vehicle. For a 7-9 car hauler entering that yard is beyond frustrating. To get out of that yard is whole another story. You will have to back into a busy traffic in 2 directions.</Review>

The car was patched together by what looks to be a mechanic with a 4th grade education, who in their right mind would sell a car with a screw forced into the brake hose so it doesnt leak?< /review>

<Text>These guys are scammers. They covered damaged under-niece framing with exterior fascia in front and back. They just hanged and strapped back with wires so I can't see in pictures what is there exactly. Also they will pulled back the framing in the back, so I couldn't open the deck-lid to inspected it.
All they do is just to full people, again they are just scammers. Stay away of them, or make sure you inspect very well what you buy, or you will write a review like mine too.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Good thing I read reviews before even considering buying from them a vehicle on eBay that when looked up by vin number has far greater damage but what they do is cover the damage with new body parts if they can't fix them with hammer and post the images where you can't tell what needs to be repaired and to what extent is it damaged. I got scammed before and hope no one gets scammed by these scammers</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Stay away. Usually salvage cars aren't a big deal. These guys hide the big damage just like the other reviewers say. Bought a run and drive truck, but it only ran for about 10 mins after leaving their yard<//Text>< Pics>

I send an odder on ebay for toyota corolla. And they send me an email with phone number to call.
When i called in they said that 2 airbags are deployed and that the car is run and drive and there is no problems other than what i can see in the picture.
When i saw the car i was surprised that 6 airbags were deployed and the car has many cracked parts other than what i saw in the picrure. Also the fuse box was destroyed.
I called customer survice to fix the problem but they said that they are not mechanics to know all the problens in the car.
I dont advise anyone to get a car online from them.
I live in michigan and the car cost me more than than buying a clear title car.<//Text>

These guys sell cars on ebay under the username WRECKEDCARSFORSALE. You do not have to believe the story I am about to tell you because you can simply call for yourself and find out its true because they have done it every time I have called over a period of months and different vehicles.

When they list cars on ebay they write very vague descriptions of the vehicle. A majority of the description is a generalized statement that they post for every car they sell. The vehicle I was looking at made no mention of it starting or not. I understand if the vehicle doesn't start that they aren't mechanics and cant tell me why that would take far too much of their time however it takes 2 seconds to turn a key and see if it starts. Knowing if a vehicle runs and drives is pretty crucial. So I called and said that I would have to fly into LAX and just wanted to know if the vehicle ran because if it didn't I would need to make towing arrangements in advance to which the employee replied "read the item description. I informed him that I had and it didn't say anything about it and he then told me "that's a ridiculous question read the description" and hung up the phone.

Here's my challenge to you. Take 5 minutes and log into ebay and search for the seller WRECKEDCARSFORSALE. Find a vehicle missing a crucial piece of information such as does the vehicle start. Trust me this will be easy. Then pick up your phone and call them and ask if the vehicle runs and watch how fast they tell you to check the description and then hang up. Then you wont have to take my word for it. And if they dont and actually provide good customer service well then I guess this post worked!<//Text>

Great shop with great service even if out of state. I'd been looking for some boots in shell cordovans with wingtips and have been fairly unsuccessful in finding them in my size. Until I found Alden of San Francisco's website with the exact design I wanted. I gave them a call and Jim assured me they had the size I wanted in stock and if needed they could exchange for different size. The process was smooth and easy, and after one exchange for different size I am happy as a clam. Thanks!< /Text>

I just bought new running sneakers here and will be back. My friend highly recommended this place and so glad I finally took her recommendation and hoofed it over to the Sunset. Well worth the trip and the time - Kim took the time to find the perfect fit in my hard-to-find size and suggested these amazing orthotics which I wore out of the store. The staff is a perfect combination of being knowledgeable and attentive, but not giving you a hard sell on anything. Fantastic place that takes even this very unserious athlete seriously.</Review>

Get some real shoes. Classic looks, well made by artisans. Buy a couple of shoes, take care of them, get them resoled (or rebuilt) when the time comes. It's how the "rich" - people who are able to pay $500 for a pair - stay rich (and comfortable).<//text>

How lucky are we to have some of the best things so close to us?
Fantastic shoes being one.  My boyfriend had been reading online about the comfort of the 403 boots.  When I saw what he was looking hearts shot out of my eyes!  Finally!  a REAL pair of shoes/boots.  Yes!  We are going!  I could not wait for Saturday to arrive when we had our first day off together.

We were promptly greeted when we walked in.  All questions answered and before I know it he's decided...those are the ones.

These are not shoes you will wear a few months and get rid of.  They are not cheap, they are meant to be long-lasting.

If you are unsure of what size to purchase, or...what size you actually wear they will help with that.  LISTEN TO THEM.
I think people often wear things they think fit but don't. Ultimately it is your call.  You purchase what feels good but if it doesn't feel comfortable, don't get it.

Great selection in store, outstanding customer service.</text>

<text>Placed an online order through their website.  Incredibly easy process with quick timely updates on my order.  Shoes arrived in immaculate condition and included a shoe horn and polish.  These small attentions to detail will ensure that I place ALL my future orders through Alden of San Francisco.  Thank you for exceptional service!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The service and knowledge of the staff is above and beyond. I would highly recommend not only Alden shoes but buying them from the Alden Shop. Unbelievably fast shipping and easy return process if they do not fit as planned.</review>< Rating>

I walked in at 5:25 on a Thursday to buy a pair of $500 shoes… Knew which ones I wanted, and being respectful of their time confirmed with the sale person there that they were closing at 6 o'clock. His response was we may close earlier, you need at least 20 minutes… And he never once looked up from computer.  They were rude as hell – I would rather walk barefoot than to ever put on a pair of their shoes< /review>

Alden makes high quality shoes and the shop offers a variety of sizes and width. However the service is unfortunately not professional. For such high price shoes you should expect the personal to be able to give you a better guidance to find the perfect size and with. This is not the case at all and quite disappointing, as they have a very strict return policy.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>When I read a bad review on this store it really makes me angry because they are phenomenal in every way. Robert Yocum has been there 14 years and he has helped me in person and for years over the phone. "A-PLUS" in every category.
By all means go and shop there. These are the best shoes on the planet hands down and I have worn them all. The only brand that almost compares is Santoni. That being said; the craftsmanship on Alden's surpasses even Santoni.
Read about Alden's process in making shoes. Read about their leathers. Know that your pride of ownership will skyrocket with a pair of Alden's on. On top of that, you can stand on them literally all day and every day and feel like a million bucks. ASK FOR ROBERT. He's such a nice man and so knowledgeable. Please don't be distracted by some lame rant or "keen observation" about the service there or them knowing how to fit you.

<Review>Alden shoes are expensive, so I view them as investments. I wanted to make sure of a proper fit because of the various lasts, so I waited to purchase a new pair until I visited the shop and could try on different sizes. The most important variable in obtaining the appropriate fit for Aldens is the particular last. I tried on several sizes of different shoes, and  Mr. Golden was very accommodating and helpful in answering my questions and helping with the fit. I ended up buying a pair of #8 color shell Cordovan wingtip boots. They shipped them to me  and added a tin of #8 polish. Everything about the transaction went very well. I just ordered a new pair of Cordovan boots from them.<//Review><Time>1446588633287<//Time>< Response>

The store manager Jim will not return my pair of shoes that were sent to him by mistake. I live in Ohio and I sent him the wrong pair. He says I have to return a pair of brown suede shoes in order to have my cordovan shoes sent back to me. I told him they were sent back, but he still will not
return my shell cordovan shoes.<//Review>

Customer service at The Alden Shop in San Francisco is impeccable. The store is beautiful, and they have a large selection of calf and shell cordovan shoes and boots. Alden's are one of the few old-school dress shoe makers making goodyear-welted footwear in the USA. Even though I don't earn "the big money" like a lot of people in the City, I appreciate a well-made shoe or boot, and I've dropped a significant amount of money there over the last few years - I think I've bought nearly 8 or 9 pieces at this point - and I have never been disappointed. I've made friendly personal connections with everyone on staff, and they always make me feel welcome when I stop in, and sometimes I just stop in to say "hi." I highly recommend them if you're looking to upgrade your footwear beyond Allen Edmonds or worse.< /Text>

Worth it!!

Amazing customer service (find Larry Lou- who comes on Saturdays)- knowledgable, professional, and dany employees! Beautiful store, and beautiful products.

Pricy, but if you would enjoy history, legacy, material, ambiance, quality, and style- you owe yourself a visit!</Review>

I was surprised to get a call from them even though I haven't done business in this particular store (I own around 8 Alden), the "shortage" of horse hide and popularity of certain shell colors (cigar, ravello and whiskey)  in a few internet forums.  Needless to say, they were very accommodating even switching my reserved size.

The price is higher by a few dollars than #8 but the shipping is free and they gave me some Alden branded shoe polish.

This and Alden of DC are my two favorite non local Alden dealers.<//Review>< user_name>

If you are coming to this store because you are expecting the type of shoes that are sold in DSW, you should look somewhere else.

The Alden Shop in San Francisco is a specialty shoe store devoted to selling Alden shoes. Aldens are one of the highest quality pair of shoes that are made here in the United States. This specialty shoe store contains one of the largest selections of Aldens on the West Coast. The shoes are beautiful, made with the type of construction that will last you your entire life.

If you're really looking to invest in a pair of quality shoes that will last you, I would highly recommend this store< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to visit and shop at the physical store, but on two occasions I needed accessories for my Alden and thanks to the help and professionalism of Jim S. I brilliantly solved the two different needs.
If and when I ever go to San Francisco the first thing I'll do is go personally thank Jim and hopefully buy another pair of Alden.

< Review>
Accompanied my wife to get her nails refilled, there was only 2 people, we were first on the list, waited patiently for about an hour and the person after us was attended before us and they were there for no more than 10mins! Talk about customer service,  never again. Highly wouldn't recommend to anyone.<//Review>

I showed them a picture with ombre nails and i walked out with only red nails ✌✌. The employees were nice but only before we payed then became really rude after when we were drying our nails post painting. They also had us waiting FOREVER and there were over 5 workers 😕😕.

Not a recommended place to come. You walk in and they tell you its only a 30 min wait and you end up waiting for 2 hours. They tell you to take a seat, you thinking they are going to work on you and you wait another 30 to 40 min. They have no social interaction with customers, very poor customer service and unprofessional. They need to hire more people ASAP!!!</Text>

Terrible customer service. Asked if the could make the water hotter and they looked and talked in their language as if they did not understand. Added more cold water instead. Refused to dump some oh the water so that hot water could be added. Needless to say, I left.< /Text>

Went in to get eyelash extensions for first time she said okay 1 hour so I waited 1 hour then I see that she's doing more nails and I ask her and then she says oh 40 more mins and I told her that I was next and she said oh it's because she's in a rush and we should all have rights because I was in a rush to and it was my turn waited 2 hours for nothing.<//Text>

<Review>we love going here! we take the boat out almost every weekend and we never fail to have a good time. there is so many places to anchor and swim. also super fun to tube and waterski! even if you dont have a boat its still fun just to sit on the beach and relax. the water is always the perfect temperature. during winter this part of the lake is closed but north shore is always open. def recommend :)<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOosKOch8eTAOOpjmXs9epw-q2L_xYdo5H3tYGN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtqE3xPoWACgfr0wHwacDZH-1Wgv8YLcTCKEL-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh8eV1khTFvdhDWSECUU6F4GI60_wDUwbP3Zi2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh9QDm9Pb8wZOfhCp1VFZP-_Cnfgy7_UihXwiD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809b40666ea97e93:0x27be5323cffce24f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I just spent the weekend here, and let me tell you, this has been the best place I've been to in a long time and I just felt that inner child again. The place was very well maintained and just let's you enjoy the importance in life and those are memories.<//review>

<review>The view was very peaceful. Forgot how quiet away from city it can be. Even though fishing was a bust enjoy getting out back into it. We did see few fish jumps. Talk to couple
People on south shore, fishing same,
One was getting ready for RC boat plane run. North shore had 1/2 dozen boaters trying their luck with wake boarding , fishing and jet ski . As the temperature warm up some we’ll be back and try it again.</review>< userid>

For years I have loved this lake, its close by and its warm, I have  visited with friends here and for family gatherings,launched boats, stayed for camping. Extremely sad to say this year was different.....😔As a dad I don't feel safe on this lake, nor do I feel safe bringing those I care about to this lake anymore. I have been a boat owner for over 15 years. Of all the lakes , rivers, reservoirs I have been to the hazards are marked (especially known hazards!!)  I was not aware there was a rock island in the middle of the lake. Why would a rock island be in the middle of a deep body of water and not be marked when its a known hazard? 🤔...negligence?! Apparently those who frequented the lake knew about this as we were informed after the fact by some boaters....so clearly the lake owners knew this. It is a private lake so they may not be required to mark hazards(I'm not sure what their regulations are). Long story short, we ended up in 4 inches of water with our boat while tubing in the middle of the lake,  with those loved aboard. After waving nearby boaters down to help us get the boat back into water, we slowly got the boat safely back on the trailer. Thank god no one was hurt and we had a shallow hull boat. If we had a  deep V boat the situation could have been catastrophic to not only the boat but to human life. I can't imagine having people being ejected from the boat if we had a wake board style boat.  On our way out we stopped by the south shore office and expressed our concerns that this is seriously dangerous and people can die from this unmarked hazard. My wife asked ,would you be willing to place some markers or 5mph warnings ⚠️ to save a life and prevent danger? The response from the lake owners representative in the office was this...... "when you sign in at the office you sign a paper that it's an at your own risk lake, so we aren't responsible" , there was zero regard for human wellbeing, safety ,or damage to property . So ask your self.... do you feel safe going on this lake? I know my answer.. If you value your life or those who may be on your vessel, I would not recommend this lake, which is owned and operated by negligent people who have no regard for safety. They (the lake owners and representatives) claim they have no responsibility for negligence because they make you "sign a paper"  😂😂 little do they know any good attorney would get that thrown out of the window in a heart beat. You can't be negligent and and get away with it. So when will they become concerned? When they are sued? I will not be visiting this lake any further as I value my life and the lives of my family. The owners will obviously see this review and then when the next person hits that rock island they can't claim they didn't know. (Personal note to owners , Mark your hazards!!! Don't be negligent!!!) You will thank me later when you  don't have to have a death on your conscious.< /Review>

< review>
For years I have loved this lake, its close by and its warm, I have  visited with friends here and for family gatherings,launched boats, stayed for camping. Extremely sad to say this year was different.....😔As a dad I don't feel safe on this lake, nor do I feel safe bringing those I care about to this lake anymore. I have been a boat owner for over 15 years. Of all the lakes , rivers, reservoirs I have been to the hazards are marked (especially known hazards!!)  I was not aware there was a rock island in the middle of the lake. Why would a rock island be in the middle of a deep body of water and not be marked when its a know hazard? 🤔...negligence?! Apparently those who frequented the lake knew about this as we were informed after the fact by some boaters....so clearly the lake owners knew this. It is a private lake so they may not be required to mark hazards(I'm not sure what their regulations are). Long story short, we ended up in 4 inches of water with out boat while tubing in the middle of the lake,  with those loved aboard. After waving nearby boaters down to help us get the boat back into water, we slowly got the boat safely back on the trailer. Thank god no one was hurt and we had a shallow hull boat. If we had a  deep V boat the situation could have been catastrophic to not only the boat but to human life. I can't imagine having people being ejected from the boat if we had a wake board style boat.  On our way out we stopped by the south shore office and expressed our concerns that this is seriously dangerous and people can die from this unmarked hazard. My wife asked ,would you be willing to place some markers or 5mph warnings ⚠️ to save a life and prevent danger? The response from the lake owners representative in the office was this...... "when you sign in at the office you sign a paper that it's an at your own risk lake, so we aren't responsible" , there was zero regard for human wellbeing or safety.

<Resp>None</Resp><review>We ordered three things and all were exceptionally bad. The pas see ew had the wrong type of noodles, they were almost like linguine pasta as opposed to flat rice noodles. The pumpkin curry was way too spicy and really not flavorful. The fried spring rolls were fine, just dripping with grease and oil.< /review>< Name>

<Review>This is definitely a Thai - Western fusion sort of restaurant, which is not really what I prefer, hence the three star rating, but if that's what you're going for you might rate it higher.

The menu had some fun history about the family that owns the restaurant and the staff were friendly and cheerful. It had a bit of a sports bar sort of feel to it, big TVs and all that.

They have a big menu with both Thai and western dishes. The Thai food that I tried wasn't bad, but was very much westernized. Lots of sugar. If you prefer a more muted Thai food experience you might really like that, but if you want something that reminds you of that time you lived in Thailand (what I was going for) you might be disappointed.

I wouldn't mind giving these guys a second chance, I feel bad giving them 3 stars and maybe I'll update it after a curry.< /Review>< Rate>

Had the Pad C Ew a couple of days ago. It is one of my favorites.  We have eaten there before, several times. The beef was like beef jerkey. Horribly tough and dry. There was little flavor on the noodles. Overall just a meal that was not worth eating. Threw most of it out. Maybe a new cook? Will try other places next time.</text>

Communication is sub par at best. What was supposed to be 2 minutes was 15minutes.
Which came from the fact that they did all of my order except one item, then started that after I'd already been standing there waiting after pick up time.
Really not sure it's worth another go.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085b464adfa1c1d:0xa15f5b469d9efdf4</Gmap_id></record>

Delicious.  Wife had the yellow curry, perfection.  Son had the long burger, cooked just right.  I had the French Dip special.  Possibly the best beef in a LONG time.  Something for everyone!< /Review>

Pongo's has the best Thai food in Petaluma! I have been to several other Thai spots around town and Pongo's is hands down my favorite. Although they are a bit pricey it is definitely worth the extra few bucks. Their portion size is reasonably large while still providing delicious and authentic flavors. It is a local spot, family owned, with great service and an inviting atmosphere. My personal favorite is the Yellow Curry, especially if you can get the Pad Thai and add some yellow curry sauce to it!! It sounds weird, but I promise it is DELICIOUS! Plus, they have takeout!<//review>

The food here is delicious! It is Thai fused with California. I had a chef special wide flat noodle dish with the tofu. The veggies were cooked just right still a bit crispy, the sauce was savory and the tofu was flavourful with a slight crispy skin. Tofu is difficult to cook and this was yummy. The price for three was a little high but we all had a Thai ice-tea which was 5$ a piece.
So I suggest if you have extra 15 spend it on the food and drink water.<//Review>

This place got high reviews from the local people, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed! I guess I have to go by the people in the area... Caucasian middle class demographic, so the restaurant dumbed down their spice level and thus took away from this extremely exotic and wonderfully ethnic food! I've eaten Thai food all over California, and this by far was the worst I've ever had! They had never heard of sticky rice, the Pad Thai was flavorless, and the Papaya Salad was borderline coleslaw! I'm not sure where you can go in this area to get a real Thai food experience... But it's not here!</review>

Yellow curry has a good flavor, though it’s boring and the beef was a bit too chewy.
Their Pad Thai is so stiff and thick, the noodles aren’t smooth or creamy.
Overall, it’s not the worst place, but their environment seems unenthusiastic and the decor/lighting is an afterthought.< /text>

< review>
Very interesting Thai-inspired restaurant in an out of the way strip mall next to Starbucks, well worth the effort to find it. Lots of great beers on tap, very vegetarian friendly menu, many items are or can be made vegan. Had the grapefruit sculpin on tap with satay salad (chicken on the side for my dining companion) and veg & brown rice wrap, a giant burrito served in a pool of delicious peanut sauce w/ cucumber salad on the side. Ask for additional hot sauce & they'll bring little cups of sriarcha, vingear chili sauce, hot chili sauce, and ground chili spice mix. Delicious. Very good food, friendly professional service, a lovely spot for lunch and live music at night as well.<//review>

When in to pick up an ice cream cake. Location is very clean and the woman that was there was extremely helpful and nice. Ended up getting ice cream and loved the variety of flowers they have. Will be definitely returning for more ice cream in the near future.< /Review>

Nice location and selection of the usual Baskin Robbins flavors. If you order two scoops, you can get a waffle cup.</review>

So, I went here with realistic expectations, its a chain, it does what chains do.
The problem is, that I noticed after eating their ice cream that there was a distinct mold taste to it.
I also have asthma and a severe mold allergy and started having an itchy throat after I stopped eating it. This is very disconcerting, and I am glad I did not eat more and have an asthma attack from mold exposure directly to my airways. I will never never go her again, but let this be a warning to allergy sufferers and anyone who does not enjoy their ice cream a'la mold. WHICH IS EVERYBODY BASKIN ROBBINS, EVERYBODY! I have never in my life had a moldy ice cream experience, and never would have imagined that it was possible for an ice cream place to make me unhappy, but this Baskin Robbins somehow managed to screw it up. I am seriously thinking of making a health department complaint.<//text>

You have to have cash in order to buy a gift card from them. That’s annoying.</Review>

Always a great solo hike. I love Mt Baldy. Especially, The devil's backbone. These photos are of baldy notch and just north of baldy notch, on the way to The D's Backbone.< /text>

<Review>Devils backbone looks scary but it’s not that scary cuz the road is quite wide. The most dangerous part is the trail after devils backbone. That trail is along the cliffs so it’s dangerous in the winter. Even without snow, you shouldn’t make any mistake there.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Amazing ridge trail over rough stones with epic views to both sides. East to rough Mojave Desert, Cajun junction and Hesperia city, west to the gorges until the cities of San Bernardino. 😃

I truly recommend the hike from Mount Baldy village to Mt San Antonio summit, Mount Baldy Notch and back down. 👍< /text>

<Review>Diamond is so gosh darn friendly and nice. Everytime I go to my storage she always smiles and says hi. But it's pretty convenient location off of 80 by the ice rink.

It's a just a tad pricey for what I got but  I'm ok with it.</Review></record></dataset><record>

They give TERRIBLE customer service! They don’t take responsibility for property they damage. My 9yr old granddaughter would be able to converse better than their office staff. Their office staff is lazy and they lie about what they can do when ending your contract. If I could give them “0” stars I would have.< /review>

After only a month I'm heavily considering not keeping this unit. There was a major hassle just obtaining it because management made a mistake, and insisted it was because their computer was broken(which didn't make sense for the kind of problem it was). I recently received a call from them telling me that one of my locks wasn't secure; so they CUT BOTH off and want me to pay $40 for the $10 locks they put on. I know I didn't put my lock on wrong and they didn't think to provide evidence that I allegedly did. I'm definitely not interested in working with a company that uses petty tactics like that just to get 40 extra dollars.</Review>

Location is convenient, however the "Free Truck use" is not really free. $40 admin fee plus you need to give them $100 cash for cleaning deposit, to be returned if you bring it back cleaned. i think they need to look up the meaning of FREE....<//Text>

This place is a scam. They raise your rates on your unit for absolutely no reason every six months and when I got the unit they assured me it wouldn’t (I have had that experience at another facility before) which was a total lie. Not only that but when I called to ask why my rate was going up with no notice, they said that they don’t have to keep my rate the same and that it’s “just the nature of the company”. The nature of the company is to scam people into staying? If I wasn’t moving in the next 2 months I would pull my things out now, but believe me once I do I will NEVER use cube smart again. I’m also going to make sure that everyone knows what a selfish company they are.</Text>

They raise their rates every six months no matter what. Even if you pay on time each month it doesn't matter, and they raise it so much that it is a hardship. I just moved out of here had two units and they wanted to raise my rent by $40.00 per month on each unit so $80.00 more a month for two 10x20' I left before having to pay the higher fee. The employees were nice but the units weren't that great and the prices are outrageous.<//text>

We went there for Ramadan iftar. The food took very long time to he ready. The menu doesn’t have many options it is mainly grilled or tagen. The food was tasty, the meet and cheese sandwich was little bit salty. The size of the meal is good. However it is overpriced. I tried other restaurants in San Diego and there is a big difference in the prices with same or better quality. All the meals are expensive they should have wider price range. The experience wasn’t bad but I don’t think will come again.<//Text>

The Aladdin Cafe has a cozy diner atmosphere and a variety of classic Mediterranean dishes.   I ordered their #4 which was 2 chicken kabobs, rice, hummus, tomato, Lebanese salad and pita.  They have many different kabobs and salads to choose from as well as pickled vegetables.  Dessert options include baklava and kunafa.  You can find plenty of filling and healthy options here for yourself and family.</Review>

<text>The best restaurant I've eaten at in San Diego.
You walk in and you just smell the deliciousness of this place. The service was great they knew their menu well and they made great recommendations. The salads, kebabs and boraks are amazing. Super fresh well seasoned will be back. Can't wait to try the lamb shanks</text>< Time>

The best lamb chops in town hands down. Even when everything is slow this place is busy. That's how good it is.  They have a good selection food always seems of quality and fresh. They are very friendly here.  I was a little surprised by the location since its not by very much , the parking lot can be a little crazy getting in and out of since its so small and busy. But its totally worth it. Definitely the best lamb. I love there salads too so delicious.  We eat here at least once a week luckily its close by to my kids school lol Definitely recommend this place especially since its a small mom n pop kind of place and not some chain restaurant< /review>

Wonderful. I’m an out of towner and the meat platter is to DIE for. It can easily feed three or four people. Here are two pics,  before and after.

Three lamb medallions, kebobs, two lamb
Keftas (sp)? And one beef.<//Text>

Delicious foods and large portions. Make sure you get some of the garlic sauce to eat with your food. This restaurant is particularly good for large groups since the food is designed to be shared. If you get food from the wood fire (you should), place the order right when you get to the table since it takes some time to cook (around 30-60 minutes).</review>

<text>What a wonderful place! Very friendly people and the customer service is excellent! The food is even better! One of the best places I’ve visited. Will definitely go back very soon to try more items from the menu. They did a wonderful job with keeping everyone safe in the middle of the pandemic. A must try! Trust me, you’ll leave feeling satisfied!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Very good food and generous portions. The books combo was tasty. We really liked the line balls. The koufta kebeb entree was flavorful. My wife had the chicken swarrma. This place was a bit busy. Not sure if it's always this way on Saturday nights. We'll be back for sure.<//Review>

two days ago was our first time we came to that place. But It is absolutely not the last. We had great time with the good service, with the great  food and wine and with the honest price. We will definitely go back there again.</Text>

I didn’t want to write this review but I am so disappointed. I work near by and we’ve ordered from here several times. The particular dish I’ve ordered now for the third time in hopes that it would be better, was not at all but in fact worse. I order the Turkish Koufta Tajine. It’s almost $20 for 16oz and takes at least 45 mins. I received just a large patty with 3 thinly sliced potatoes (one was rotten), 3 tomatoes, 3 peppers and several chunks of garlic. They have changed the recipe and don’t mention that on their website. You don’t receive anything like the picture. I called to ask for a refund and was told I would have to bring the item back in order to receive it. We won’t be ordering from here again because if you can’t take care of your repeated customers spending hundreds of dollars than I will take my business elsewhere.< /review>

Amazing and delicious Mediterranean restaurant! Aladdin has been here as long as I can remember, and it's always been great! My family decided spur of the moment to get our dinner here tonight. We're a family of 5, plus we love leftovers, so the order was rather big. I placed the order over the phone, the receiving employee was very quick and efficient -- everything came out perfectly and SUPER tasty.

Get #11 and the cheese borak :)< /Text>

We had our Wedding Day dinner at Aladdin Mediterranean Restaurant and couldn't be happier! The food was phenomenal and the service was top notch!
Mike made sure we had everything we needed.
We felt like we were at our favorite Uncle's house for dinner.
Thank you to Mike & all of the amazing staff at Aladdin's for making our Wedding Day even more special!< /Text>

Aladdin is my go-to for Greek and Mediterranean. Staff knows the menu very well if you want to ask for recommendations. Service is fast and friendly and the food is fantastic. Looks good, tastes good. They also do take out! 11/10 to Mike for being so awesome!<//Text>

<username>Sunny Kahn</username><Date>1598759185415<//Date><rate>5< /rate><text>10 stars if I could rate that high. Incredibly welcoming staff and the owner was an absolute sweetheart. It felt fantastic to find food that was just like I used to eat in Beer Sheva, and made a hard time that much better. Tea is phenomenal and you get free refills if you buy a whole teapot. Servings are HUGE so come extremely hungry. Pita is homemade and so soft and fluffy and delicious. Will definitely be coming back<//text>< pictures>

<review>We had very bad server, made many mistakes.. She was very slow, got 3 of our orders wrong and charged us 18% tip for a party of 4 even though she was terrible. Probably won't be dining there again. Food was good.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Experienced one of the Mediterranean cuisines in San Diego. The salad, Pita, hummus and fries that I had here were really fresh and tasty. The service here was great and quick. It was my first time here. Though it’s expensive, I think they have the best quality food here. Highly recommend the Turkish ice cream with Baklava for dessert!</Review>

<Text>Feels so good when you get amazing food in a patio restaurant amidst COVID situation. We ordered hummus plate, falafel and baklava. Lips smacking I must say! Tastes so authentic. Our server was Katie. She was really sweet to us and attentive as well. All in all, a place to come back to, again!!<//Text>< user>

Sooooooooooo good omg. The kefta kebabs are to die for. I grew up in the Middle East and have been to multiple Middle Eastern restaurants across the US. Believe me when I say Aladdin does their kebabs right. So so so good.</text>

<Text>Wonderful birthday dinner.  Dined al fresco,  and the service and food were amazing. We ordered the lamb chops and the mixed grill. Portions are huge. I have enough leftovers for lunch & dinner tomorrow.  Even the little things like the salad and pita were delicious.  Don't leave without trying the baklava!
*** One side note, the rack of lamb needs to be ordered 24 hours in advance. They should add that to their online menu.< /Text>< Pictures>

I usually come to this place once a month. We had the rudest service today. Her name was Katie.

The first time she came in said:
It will take me some time to get to you guys!! (with huge attitude)

Then she came in and asked: what kind of drinks you want (with an attitude). I said what kind of beer you guy carry. She replies: you know what.. I don't know... I probably repeated this 100 times today!!! (With an attitude). I grabbed my stuff and left.

You know what... if you wanna charge extra for middle easter food, you better provide a service that matches this price.<//review>

<Review>This is definitely my favorite Mediterranean food in the San Diego area. Their entire plates are huge (I'm a fan of the gyro), and the pizzas are really unique. For me though the highlight is definitely the hummus and baba ganoush. No where else will you find a creamier and more flavorful version of these two.< /Review><Date>1603432611582< /Date>< rating>

You can’t get better Mediterranean food than this place! Everything I’ve tried here (except the falafel which is good but not amazing because it’s kinda dry) is amazing. Love the chicken schwerma entree, the pita wraps are amazing. Hummus is the best ever - so creamy and light. We’re harsh critics and we’re huge fans of this place.<//text>

Update: new menu! I love their lamb shank. It’s the best around and it’s the best price! Their food somehow I felt for better too. No more booze tho, but you can bring in your own at no cost. The mixed combo is a must get. Their salad is the beat, get with any dish!!

Total fan of their chicken salad and their wraps. The food is good and delicious. My bf always order their salads and I always order their gyro. The food is legit! The naan and hummus is also good. Although they changed the way they cooked their naan. Which is okay, still really good. The patio is dog friendly.<//Text>

<Text>I have been here many times. Obviously, the food isn't as good as what you eat anywhere in mediterranean bu it is still good food. Pizzas are worth trying. Hummus and salads are always fresh. I'd expect better pita from a place that has a  fire wood oven but I'll still go ahead and recommend this place.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlNo49nmMER7ae_vdoz4cCQzQn_vVxZFG7otDr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

It was our first time here. Excellent service and great food. Our waiter recommended a platter for two. The platter came with 5 different kinds of kebab and rice plus tasty salad. Salad was very refreshing and fresh never had it like that before. We ordered Arabian mint tea. It was awesome. I'm going to see how to make that tea at home. Very clean place and busy. Definitely worth a try to visit .</review>

Huge portions of really high-quality meats marinated in delicious herbs and spices!  You can feed 4 people on one of their mix plates and everyone will love their meal and leave satisfied.  I really will look forward to come back here when I'm visiting San Diego!  Highly recommended!</text>

Ordered from this restaurant for the first time from ubereats. I was a little taken back by the price but my coworker said it’s a lot of food and it is worth it. I decided to go for it. Oh. My. Word. It is so good. It was enough food for 3 or 4 meals and was absolutely fresh and delicious. I have marked this place as a favorite and hope to visit it when the quarantine is over! Amazing!</review>

After seeing ads on YouTube, I had to try this restaurant out. It is worth the 2 hr drive from Imperial Valley. The atmosphere, the aromas, the music, and the personalities are a great mix and pleasant. Mike, my waiter, is attentive and friendly. I shall return to experience more. I am hoping that there would be live music and belly dancing there. I ask "you", please bring it there for the (full) Mediterranean experience.< /review>

<Review>My first visit here.  I love lamb, and the server suggested a dish of 2 lamb chops, 2 chicken and 1 beef kabob, and a dinner salad.  The price above the dinner she suggested was $19.50.  For me, that's a very expensive lunch, but it sounded special.  It was good.  When the tab came, it was $34.50!  I wouldn't spend that much for a good dinner!  When I questioned it, she said that selection she described wasn't the $19.50 selection, but a selection further up the menu.  As I said, I would never have spent $34.50 on lunch no matter how good it sounded.  It may have been an honest mistake, but for someone not familiar with the menu, I think some kind of discount should have been offered.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I am really surprised to see the fluctuations of consistency.
Recently, I visited the place for dinner with my friends who were travelling from other states.

We ordered the three mixed grill plate  and somehow one of the "Chicken Keema Kebabs" was smelly and stale. We informed our server and she discussed the same with the Chef/Cook. Later the waitresses explained the one of Kebab skewers was free and if I want, I can remove from my plate.

Both Chef and the Waitress ignored the main issue about bad food and asked us to eat remaining They should not have served that kebab in the first place no matter whether its free or not.

Note that, as I tried this place 3-4 times already; chicken Keema kebab always been served int he mixed grill platter. All the explanation was worthless and shocking to see the un-professionalism.</Text>< Pics>

Chicken Shawarma get in my mouth!! So been here a couple times and it is awesome. Great wait staff. Outside seating so you can hang out with your friends or family at the end of the world. Need a mask to go inside but outside is like face freedom central. Wait we still do that?.....yes we do friend. The garlicky mouthgazm that is in the chicken shawarma sandwich is a gift from the food gods. I would for sure recommend eating a ladle full. Big portions, fresh hummus, and just down right yum.<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I just had dinner with my husband and two couples of friends in Aladdin, and went through a horrible experience. I visited the restaurant many times before, since the food is good. But after what I went through today, I will never return to the place. We ordered a descent amount of food, which was all good. But then the waitress mistakenly brought out two portions of Mawashi, (despite the fact that we ordered only one) and the meat in it was raw. We immediately requested to return the dish, and then a young kid named Ali said the chef checked the Mawashi and the meat is fine. Therefore he'll charge us for one of the portions that we ordered, since we ordered only one portion and not two. We asked to speak with the manager, and Ali said that he already left. When we asked our waitress Sandra to call the manager, she said we just spoke to one... Surprisingly Ali happens to be the owner's son who's apparently ruining his dad's business by providing an awful customer service. If one of your loyal customers requests to return a dish you don't confront him and try to prove him wrong! You should simply apologize and give him a refund. Not one minute passed by and Sandra approached our table again asking if we'd like to order desert and offered boxes to go. We said we're good, but then she said that since this is a dangerous neighborhood the restaurant requests its customers to leave by 9pm, and handed us the bill. We told her we live down the street and we find it offensive that she considers Clairmont as a dangerous neighborhood. She replied "l know, me too". The restaurant was still filled with people. What a rude attempt to kick out your customers. When reviewing the bill we saw that not only they added the raw Mawashi as Ali said he would, but also added 18% gratuity charge to the bill. I happened to eat in many restaurants around the world, and never have I felt so unwanted and disrespected.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Awesome service, even though they were very busy. Food was delicious and large portions. Prices are only slightly higher than other places, but definitely worth the extra $. Large menu, there 8s something for everyone. I'll definitely be back.< /Review>

Aladdin's definitely has the market cornered on Mediterranean food in San Diego. It's often a favorite for a Sunday lunch with my family.

While the location is convenient to the 805 freeway, the parking can be a hassle. It shares the parking lot with other businesses, and while it looks large, it's surprisingly small. The restaurant is super casual, but it feels nice and open. It's always clean, and inviting.

You can't beat the food there. We usually get the Meza Platter - a dish that comes with 8 small dishes that includes hummus, babaganoush, chicken, lamb, and a bunch of other things, along with a pizza. The baklava is great too. Served with ice cream. These three things fed 5 hungry adults. Service is standard and prices are very reasonable.

This place could easily host large parties and kids are always welcomed there.

I always look forward to going to Aladdin's.<//text>

Wow!  Authentic cuisine, obviously made with passion.  And, service that's second to none.  Angie, my wife's and my new friend, is an angel.  Angie, has terrific taste as she recommended the Lamb Shank and it's simply a tremendous dish... fall off the bone tender, and savory and rich.< /review>

Always great food, great service, they never forget their customers.  Everytime we come here we have a great experience.  Food always fresh.  Plenty of seating especially with their expansion and outdoor seating.  Parking is tight but manageable.   Everything  is directly made on site.  Our kids enjoy dining here, we like the peaceful atmosphere. We always end up bringing home doggy bags there is so much food.  Everything on the menu is very good.  Next time you want a new experience come here you won't regret it!!</review>

<Review>We were visiting and came here for dinner. We ordered the mixed grill and felt that one of the kabobs was a bit stale. We complained about it to our server. She asked the chef and came back with a weird response. Completely ignoring our talking point, she said that it’s free and it doesn't typically come with that order. I don't know why you would put stale food in front of somebody regardless of that being free.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Today was suppose to be a happy day for my family and I . After my graduation ceremony, my sister called to make a reservation for 11 people and we drove to the restaurant to have my graduation dinner there. This waitress who I don’t recall her name was the most condescending and rude of them all.( I can provide more details upon request).   I will not spent a dime of my money in a place that doesn’t treat all its costumer with respect. When we pointed out her behavior she screamed at us and told us to get out.  I grow up in the Middle East and this is worst treatment I had in an Arabic restaurant.

Don’t come here if you want to have good time without being treated like trash.< /Review>

<Text>Decent place, great staff and customer service. The owner was very respectful. I was not satisfied with one of the dishes and they accommodated me with another dish with no question asked. I ended up having kofte kabob sandwich wrap, very tasty and juicy. Enjoyed it very much. Definitely going back on my next trip to San Diego.<//Text>< GmapID>

Mmmm, so good! Had the chicken shawarma and lentil soup, both worth having again. The hubby and I have kinda been on a shawarma kick lately and this place has the best out of the last four places we've tried. The decor is fun too. We'll definitely be headed back soon.</review>

The hummus and lentil soup was very delicious. Probably the best I've had in San Diego. I got my  wisdom teeth removed so I couldn't try a lot of items on the menu. From my team expressions the another options were amazing as well. I'll be returning to try another options once I'm healed up. 🙂</review>

<Text>Great food, atmosphere, and service.  Generous portions.  My wife had the chicken shawerma, which was some of the best I've had, and she and I split her leftovers for another meal.  I had the mixed grill, which was a LOT of food, and took about half home.  The chicken kabob was especially tender and moist.  Highly recommended.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>This is a place you won’t try twice if:
1- You care about the quality of the food. I ordered a mixed shish kebab plate and the lamb kebab was completely burnt! Basically it was lamb flavored carbon. The salad dressing that I make at home is tastier than theirs! And the whole food was soaked in oil.
2- You don’t have extra time to waste waiting to be sited! (There was no line) and then waiting for the waitress to show up!
PS: food is pretty expensive at this place.
Forgot their utensils and has to remind them to bring it. Under staffed.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dc007fa3e9c5b5:0x427c328d753e044d</Gmap_id>< UserId.>

<Text>Exceptional Mediterranean fare.  Used this place for a large (250 people) event I needed catered, and was blown away by how outstanding the food was.  The stuffed grape leaves were heavenly - the best I've EVER had... the baba gahnouj, hummus, garlic spread (the heavenly garlic spread), chicken and beef skewers were outstanding, as well.  Every single thing was absolutely amazing - including the service.  I'm a foodie from NYC and I have not had better Mediterranean than this.</Text></record>

Bad customer service! Very Bad ! Posting this after third bad experience here, although we love the food here but won't be going anymore as wait time is long in rush hours, food comes late even if it does come on time, the serving waiter wont come back to see if we needed anything, and if u complain the waiter gets rude not admitting his mistake constantly answering and bickering in rude manners.
I won't bother to come back here because the food is not worth for bad customer treatment.<//Review>

I don't know where to begin. My wife ordered the lentil soup. It was pureed. I've never had pureed lentils at a Mediterranean restaurant. Maybe I've been eating at inauthentic restaurants or maybe this was just not prepared in the traditional manner. I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. It was not only greasy, dripping with brown oil, but covered in some indescribable sauce - one I've never had in 53 years of eating Mediterranean food. There were no tomatoes, lettuce or any type of yogurt-based sauce that I've always seen served with shawarma. Again, maybe I've had inauthentic food. Finally, the dolma were the type that have been marinated in tomato sauce. I prefer them without sauce, so this is a preference issue rather than one of authenticity. Regardless, they were not my favorite. Ultimately, this was not a good experience for us, and I don't intend to return.<//Review>

Nice spot for middle eastern food. Food was so delish. I think I might become a regular. The place has a cool atmosphere. I see why this place has a lot of good reviews.<//Review>

<review>One of the best places for Mediterranean in SD, in my opinion. Lots of people go here, but never feels too crowded. I love the kabob plate with different varieties of chicken, beef and lamb. Also, the garlic butter is excellent! The portions are generous. The teas and Turkish coffee is a must. Five stars.</review>< pics>

< Review>
This is the best Middle Eastern Restaurant I've been to in the US. I lived in the Middle East for 3 yrs. so I know what that food 🥘 is like and this place has the right ambiance, the nice people and the right recipes. It was my go to place the many years I lived in San Diego. Had many celebrations there. I miss this restaurant more than many. It has a small store and bakery with delicious pastries with a great Middle eastern flavor.</Review>

<review>Extremely rude manager! He kick me and a group of women out of the restaurant just because we asked to speak with the manager and little did we know that he was standing in front of us. He was being inappropriate with the ladies and was cursing at us. He even got into the face of one of the ladies and said "if I want to I can kick you out of my restaurant when ever I feel like it" he said this and many more things that we ended up leaving after he told us to get out. The group of women and myself went to this restaurant to have a nice dinner and have a Christian gathering which the manager made fun of by saying "I can pray for you because I'm a Pastor" and he started laughing after saying this. He started checking out one of the ladies and said "you're the prettiest one here, your smile is gorgeous" he stared looking down her shirt and making her uncomfortable. We wish we would have recorded this and have him fired.  He did a lot more that what I posted. He is a bald man around 5ft 6in and looks a bit Asia. He does speak Spanish as we were a group of Mexican women and everything he said to us was in Spanish. I really hope this man gets fired. We will like to speak with the restaurant owner. Note we were a group of 20 women.<//review><user_id>116056869337346977798</user_id></record>

Delicious food, especially the sampler appetizer platter, the hummus, pizzas, and salads. Nice service, though a bit slow sometimes. Can be a bit pricey but you get a lot of food and good quality. French fries are really good too! Try to make reservations if you can</Review>

The best middle eastern food I've had anywhere! Very authentic and reasonably priced for the quality. Large portions, full of flavors and fresh ingredients. Especially like the salads and the lamb biryani. Must visit if you're in San Diego<//review>

<review>We came here for dinner, and ordered 1 pizza originally, not knowing that these were single serving pizzas. So we ordered a second pizza, and these $15 pizzas each. I am not sure if wood fire pizzas are this expensive, but taste-wise, they were good tasting, not amazing for that price. Also the customer service was not good, we had to wait and continuously call the waiter over for service during our visit. If you are looking for fancy pizza with a date, then this is the place, but not for families.< /review>< gmapID>

This place is amazing! I've been going to this location for a few years now but i got food catered to the office for the first time last week, and everyone couldn't be happier, the food is amazing, the delivery was on time and food was hot. I'll be ordering for all my employees atleast once a week , everyone was so happy from the meat lovers to the vegans! 5 stars all around. To top it off the guy delivering it was very helpful and profesional!< /Text>

My coworkers go here, and my friends eat here. Within seconds of walking in, we're greeted, and treated like family.

I usually order a chicken shwarma sandwich, and it's hot, fresh, and at my table in minutes.

The platters are great for sharing or family style. Big groups, or date night, Aladdin's is a wonderful mix of exotic, and comfort food.

The can't miss: baklawa ice cream sandwich is next level dessert.<//Text>< pictures>

Such good food that I had planned on taking pictures to share on my review, but completely forgot and ate everything immediately. Hummus with lamb shawarma, lentil soup, and a chicken shawarma sandwich. Earl Grey tea with fresh mint. The service was friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back for more!</Review>

Please excuse my less than perfect ability to articulate.  Five Stars, why? because my consistent habit with places to eat, is the same. I never deviate from each place I frequent. I ONLY order one of the many offerings from each place I go. This is a life long habit. My 5 stars are very pinpointed at just one group of foods from Aladdin.. chicken hummus garlic paste, tabouli (sp) . This is not only the best tasting chicken in memory, but Aladdin never deviates from a very high standard. Trust me, that is a difficult standard to maintain, year in and year out, but the friendly people at Aladdin accomplish this. Aladdin is not only the best Mediterranean restaurant in San Diego County, but I will go a bit over the top and say, it is the best restaurant.. period. That is because of great flavors, every time!!< /review>

Authentic Mediterranean food!
Mixed Grill is my favorite here. They serve it as the combination of chicken and lamb kabobs along with Lamb chops. It is very tender and juicy.
You can also try hummus with shawarma in Appetizer.
Pita bread and salad are complementary .
Staffs are friendly and courteous.< /text>

Lovely cardamom notes in the chicken complement the yoghurt garlic sauce rather well, with the obligatory hummus. Though don't mistake obligatory with pedestrian, as the hummus is also damn good.

It seems to be a mix of Mediterranean,  Middle Eastern and even some Indian dishes.  I had the tika lamb kebab. The meat was cooked just right. My husband had Lamb Kafta (sausage). Both dishes came with rice,  salad and hummus. Plenty of food. He liked it. I tried it, and thought it was very flavorful, and also tender (not overcooked). Service was slightly slow to start, but once we ordered, picked up.  Busy place. A little loud, but it was a Friday evening. Owners? and staff are nice and pleasant to customers.<//Text>

Great place for vegetarians and vegans. Surprisingly inexpensive for a good dinner experience.

Vegetarian Mesa platter is a must for a group of 3 or more.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The service was spectacular! Very friendly and attentive  (but not too much so). This meal came with an enormous veggie salad, simply dressed with a light vinaigrette and just what this hungry traveler needed. (Air travel etc, immediately makes me feel fruit/veg deficient.) The chicken kebabs were just amazing! Tender, juicy, and so tasty- the best I've had since living in Turkey. And don't get me started on the freshest, most delicious baklava I have ever tasted!! I will definitely go back if my travels ever bring me to San Diego again.<//Text>

<Time>1563418912576<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>An evergreen favorite for Lebanese food.  Every dish is freshly prepared, full of color and zest.  The appetizer list has a lot to offer - hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, lamb and cheese borak.  One can make a meal out of the appetizers alone.  The kebabs are all very succulent and delicious and served with tangy green salad.  Finally, baklava is a super must for everyone visiting this restaurant.  I tried baklava in Greece but Aladdin is far better in every way.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dc007fa3e9c5b5:0x427c328d753e044d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food is good but still I wish there was an option to rate 0 or negative because of their behavior. I gave 5 dollars of tip and while getting into my car, the waiter came to my car and ASKED RUDELY and FORCED me to give more tip amount and told that it’s LAW in USA to give tip amount to be more than 22%. As they have my credit card information so I gave more tips. It’s horrible and surprisingly extreme rude behavior. Also FYI in their menu it’s written that “In USA it’s customary to give 15-22% of tips”.<//Text>

Do not get this place confused with a lesser quality substitute, also called Aladdin, located in Hillcrest. This is a great restaurant. When ordering out using a delivery service, verify you’re selecting this place; the correct place with best quality that’s located in Clairemont Mesa Blvd.<//Text>

One of my all time favorites. Yes a little pricey. But the quality of food you're getting well worth it. Everything we ordered was fantabulous! I had the lamb beef in a pita. My husband had the lamb chops. Both where cooked exceptionally well! Yes I'll be back! The baklava was fresh and delish.< /text>

For the prices they're charging I was expecting a treat. Pretty mediocre. The portions aren't generous and the flavour lacks the authenticity. But the lamb tikka was the highlight of the order that I made. Most Middle Eastern restaurants in San Diego offer their meat tikka in either beef or veal, not lamb.
Imho, Sultan Baklava (on 4th Ave) is still the best experience for ME cuisine in terms of authenticity, flavour and generosity of their portions.</text>

The food is incredibly delicious. I underestimated the quality of the food based upon the atmosphere and location.

The atmosphere is casual in nature but still very authentic.</text>

<review>Food definitely goes above and beyond. The pizza may have been the weak link (definitely not finger food, still tasted good) but everything else was amazing. Manager was my waiter, definitely very passionate and the staff is friendly. 4.5/5 for the food (for now), 5/5 experience, the baklava is a 6/5. Somewhat pricy but the taste of the baklava leaves a priceless inpression.< /review>< pics>

This is the best food in town.  Hamdi's facility is awesome and Mike the manager is incredible. If you want great Greek Food, there is no other place to go in San Diego.  You can take that to the bank.</review>

The cheese and the spinach borak appetizers were quite good, but the lentil soup was fairly average. The lamb shish kebab was tasty but a little bit on the tough side. The ambiance does not quite equal the prices</Text>

Food was amazing and really affordable. We got the mix plate of grilled meats, a huge salad, assorted pickled veggies, grilled veggies, drinks for 4 and an appertizer for $50. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the service. They need to hire more people. Plus I witnessed the manager yelling at customers because they were late to their reservation and was seated by a waitress that didnt know they were late. The manager came out and began yelling at them saying they cant just sit down after being 45 minutes late. The customers were trying to tell him over his screaming that they didnt just sit down they were sat down by the waitress. Very unprofessional.<//review>

<user_name>Cheri B</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>OMG!  This place is amazing!  From the hummus and pita bread appetizer to the gyros and Shawarma chicken sandwiches the food was to die for.

The place is busy and consequently, noisy but with good reason.

We had planned to eat at a Thai place across the street which was closed on a Sunday at lunch time so we decided to try Aladdin’s.

I’m sooooo glad we did.

We will be back.< /Text>< date>

This is one of my favorite spots is town for healthy, Mediterranean food. It's one a the few places that has good Kibeh, the falafel is great. Perfect salads and I think the best babaganoush I have ever had. If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out!</Review>

Yummmo! I get the Mediterranean salad (sans chicken and feta). Hubby gets the Falafel sandwich with curly fries.  We both love the lentil soup.  Soooooo good!< /text>

Box falafel, store bought hummus, and dolmas have more flavor! The falafel was over cooked with no flavor. The hummus and basmati also had no flavor. Their dolmas tasted Italian. The pita bread was not vegan even though their website said it was. The manager was very rude, humming throughout, knocking on tables, and ordering the waitress over. We had to ask for a side hummus because it didn’t come with pita bread and got half an order of hummus with more pita bread! They seem shorted staff. The food was edible, but I definitely DO NOT recommend!!</review>

Aladdin has the best Greek salad around! The dressing is amazing.
Only down side is that it is a bit pricey.< /Review>

This is one of my favorite spots is town for healthy, Mediterranean food. It's one a the few places that has good Kibeh, the falafel is great. Perfect salads and I think the best babaganoush I have ever had. If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out!<//Text>

Been coming here for years.  The food is always delicious.  It can be crowded but the wait staff won't leave you stranded.  I've eaten the whole menu, not in one sitting, and everything is good.  Lamb Borak ftw!</Review>

The falafel was at best a Mediterranean hush puppy. The Greek salad was great, very plentiful and the chicken shawrema wrap was mostly tortilla. I would say lavash, but it tasted like a tortilla.<//text>

The French fries was Crispy and soft (it had alot of oil though). And the motabbal was just on point, no excess oil, not too little. However, the service were either annoying or careless. We had two servers apparently a Mexican women and an Asian man. The Mexican women seemed like she didn't want to work, whereas, the man was overly excited to work that he began to annoy with his refrains throughout the experience.
In short: great food, shabby service.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The best Mediterranean in San Diego. Staff is nice, service is prompt and the food is extremely fair priced. Parking can be challenging, so consider the street!<//text>

Great place! Probably the best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever been!
We took big wonderful plate of greek chicken salad, #11 mixed grill (it had big rice plate) and cheese borak. Everything was very delicious with adequate prices and good enough for 4 adults and a child!
Cabernet Sauvignon was not that great, but it's not a wine place though:)<//Text>

My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in San Diego. The chicken shawarma, baba ganoush and fresh pita are fantastic. They also have a great choice of pizzas.</Review>

<review>Cute atmosphere, wide selection of herbal teas and Mediterranean foods. They have hookah, so I think it's a hookah bar at night. The falafel appetizer was really delicious. I wish they served it Amsterdam Falafel style (WDC friends know what I'm talking about). Comes with pita triangles and tahini. I ordered a Greek salad, and the Greek salad was very good - I made little falafel pitas with the salad.
Mylo got the Fatoush salad, and it looked a little lacking - seemed to be light on the s'mac but they were really skimpy on the pita chips and didn't have feta on it although you can add it. Salad itself was large. Dave got the lamb schwarma and he said it was good. It came with a nice little greek salad, but I will have to try the schwarma for myself -- looked like it might be dry. Turkish coffee is delicious. Has a bit of minty flavor, which was quite pleasant.

Meal menu is a bit overpriced, service can be slow.<//review><username>Tricia Pooladi</username><date>1551755325411</date><rate>3< /rate></record></dataset><record>

We had 2 plates, #3 and #4, i.e chiken and lamb with rice, hummus, salat, etc. The chiken was very good, very tasty and i loved it with the garlic sauce. The lamb on the other hand was very chewwy, neither of us liked it. The service is very good and super friendly.< /Review>

Can't speak much to the meat because I'm vegan, but the falafel here is EVERYTHING, and the hummus and pita are also very good. I also like that the vegan-friendly items are clearly labeled on the menu. A+<//Text>

What a place we chose for Mothers day, got 2 thumbs up.

I was under immense pressure taking Wife out for Lunch on Mothers day, who is picky and can afford very small room of error. But she was blown away by the food.
We ordered, Lamb Biriyani, Pita bread with Garlic sauce, Chicken Tika Kabob and Kanafa.

Everything was so perfect along with our Waitress Dana, she was very pleasant. To end, Kanafa stole our hearts. We will go there again, soon. For Garlic Sausce and Kanafa :)

Mothers day was succesful, mission accomplished. She even forgot that i did not get her flowers ;)</Text>

<Review>Best Mediterranean food I've ever had. The food was fresh and sizzling. As a vegetarian, I ordered the falafel sandwich... I was pleasantly surprised to find the falafels were cooked perfectly, immersed in fresh vegetables and spices. My boyfriend ordered some crazy meat platter (shiskabob combo) and he was overwhelming surprised by the perfection of flavors as well. I'm writing this now because we kept repeating over and over again that was freakin' amazing. These guys did Aladdin justice :) if I'm ever back in California, I'll be coming here for sure.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>I just ordered the stuffed grape leaves, they tasted great, but it was SO over priced! A little over $16 for 12 stuffed grape leaves and a small yogurt dip is too much. There were no sides at all.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) Large and welcoming place. The prices are correct ... but the dishes are for sharing. They look small but they are not. The cheese something delicious .. highly recommended !! Enjoy your meal

<Text>(Translated by Google) The restaurant offers very nice and delicious food, but unfortunately the chef in charge of the restaurant is begging for the customers, knowing that the customer is not obliged to pay the tea and it is optional and it comes with all finesse and the customer argues about the amount of tobacco and says why it is less and should pay more. This is the first and last time I go to this restaurant. Unfortunately, the reputation of the restaurant will lose a lot because of these behavior

المطعم يقدم طعام جميل ولذيذ جدا  ولكن مع الاسف الشيف المسؤول على المطعم يستجدي التب من الزبائن مع العلم ان الزبون غير مجبر على دفع التب وهو اختياري وياتي بكل صلافة ويجادل الزبون على مبلغ التب ويقول لماذا هو قليل ويجب أن تدفع اكثر   . هذه اول واخر مرة اذهب بها الى هذا المطعم . مع الاسف سمعة  المطعم ستخسر كثيرا بسبب هذه التصرفات<//Text>< Rating>

<review>(Translated by Google) Everyone was very friendly and naive. We loved the waiter friend. The location is very clean. The prices are also affordable, because the menus are great. Middle East and Mediterranean people who can't get used to American food can feed their bellies. We ate a mixed grill with two people, we were full of mis. As a result, go eat friends, taco does not work this :) I also put the menu there. Enjoy your meal.

(Original)
Herkes çok güler yüzlü ve naif. Garson arkadaşa bayıldık. Mekan gayet temiz. Fiyatlar da uygun, menüler büyük çünkü. Amerikan yemeklerine bir türlü alışamayan Ortadoğu ve Akdenizliler karnını bir güzel doyurabilir. Biz bir mixed grill’i iki kişi yedik, mis gibi de doyduk. Sonuç olarak gidin yiyin arkadaş, tacoyla olmuyor bu iş :) menüyü de koyuyorum şuraya. Afiyet olsun.<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The amounts of meals are excessive. It is unnecessary so much to justify the price. Better would be lower prices with healthier portions. Tea is another example ... You get a huge bag and only a glass instead of a kettle ... Ridiculous. The meats are very good as positive. The restaurant should take more care of your image.

(Original)
Las cantidades​ de comidas son excesivas. Es innecesario tanta cantidad para justificar el precio. Mejor sería precios más reducidos con porciones más saludables. El té es otro ejemplo... Te dan una bolsa enorme y solo un vaso en vez de una tetera... Ridículo. Las carnes están muy buenas como positivo. El restaurante debería cuidar más su imagen.< /Text>
