Hector and Team Enrique were great! We hired them to move our private practice office. They were on time, clean and professional. In order to adhere to COVID19 protocols, they had a cleaning station set up and always wore masks so that all were protected during the move (see picture below).  Office was moved efficiently and without damage. I would recommend Atlas Transfer and Storage Co. for any of your moving needs without hesitation.<//text>

We’ve moved many times over the years and this was our smoothest move yet. On the front end, the crew packed us in one day instead of two and were on the road a day early. On the back end, they had availability early (we hadn’t made it there yet).  They were great at keeping in touch the whole time. The crew that unloaded us (Tyler, David, Alfonso, Tre and Lewis) were were very nice, fast, efficient and careful with everything. Would completely recommend!< /Text>

EXCELLENT service from start to finish.   Kip (who gave us our estimate and was our point person), Karen (who works in the office), and Al Vasquez (who was our driver and lead mover) were all very helpful, pleasant, and calm!
We were moving ourselves and my 92 year old dad from CA to FL.   The front end involved picking up our belongings from our apartment and storage unit, and my dad’s things from the senior living facility where he lived.   For me, the logistics were daunting.  For Kip, Karen, and Al—it was a piece of cake.
Al and his team loaded the trucks so quickly—the teamwork was amazing!   And all the guys were happy, hard working, they looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs.
Our belongings were delivered on the day Al said they would be delivered.   Our things in a storage unit (until our home is done being built) and my dad’s things delivered to his new apartment in senior living.   Again, Al’s team on the FL end were amazing!     They kept asking us if we were okay when they were the ones sweating in the FL heat and humidity.    We were so impressed with the team, we hired them to move our things from storage to our home when it’s ready.
I like everyone’s happy attitude.   And I really appreciated the communication, always keeping us informed.
I would HIGHLY recommend them!!!!!!!<//Text>

<Review>Traci coordinated a great move from California for business to get us relocated in a short period of time.
The pack crew executed the packing of the house in one day and everything was prepared for the move out the following day.  Thanks to Mike, Gil and Matt for a job well done!
Pete came in to handle the driving.  He was professional and responsive in coordinating everything for the loading as well as a delivery across the country in North Carolina.  My wife really appreciated his friendliness and professionalism as well have moved well over a dozen times  in the last 30 years.
I completely recommend this group.  I was pleased when I heard that the company was assigning an Allied agent and the folks from Atlas Transfer & Storage have executed everything wonderfully right through getting our stuff into storage while we wait on the final move!< /Review>< Pictures>

Hector Ortiz and his team of Enrique & Chris did an outstanding job packing my mother’s home for her move cross country.  They were extremely professional and safety conscious in light of the COVID 19.  They set up an sanitary station outside the front door and placed a sticky mat to prevent them from tracking in dirt & dust.  I would highly recommend them to pack me again.< /Review>

Atlas did just a tremendous job for us. Tyler, Marcus, Joe, Lewis, Tre, Ernie and Alfonso were fast, careful and really nice people. They did the job within the estimated time and cost.

Kim in the office did a great job also. She accommodated a last minute scheduling change very nicely. She is obviously a wonderful person.

Can’t say enough nice things about Atlas.<//Text>

<Text>I cannot say enough about this company! Absolutely the best!  There are a lot of dishonest companies in this business (we checked out many), but Trevor came right out and quoted exactly what the price was. Hector Ortiz and his crew were great! Enrique, Victor, John and Josue were very careful and responsive to our requests. Hector and Enrique each had over 20 years experience, and it showed! Everyone knew their stuff and worked quickly and efficiently. They really showed that they cared. If you want the best movers out there choose this company and Hector and his team. You won’t be disappointed!< /Text>< Pictures>

We had several large pieces of furniture and valuable art. All were packed and delivered with extreme care. They used floor covers and door pads to ensure our wood floors and doors were protected. They also practiced COVID safety wearing face masks and setting up a hand washing station. They also used sticky pads that removed dirt from their shoes protecting our wood floors and carpeted bedrooms. We first used Hector and his crew about 10 years ago and were so impressed with their professionalism and care that we explicitly requested them for today's move.

Allied Van Lines made my out-of-state move seamless and easy! Traci helped me to understand the estimate and expectations while working within my timeframe. Then on move day, our driver Robert and his team showed up on time, and handled our valuables with care and professionalism. Similarly, they were able to carefully place our belongings into the storage locker with care and efficiency. We will definitely call them again next time!</Text>

For the unloading after a cross country move I had Hector Ortiz and his team of Enrique and John. These guys did a great job protecting the house prior to the move. They protected the floors carpets and walls prior to unloading. They used protective blankets on all the corners to prevent any damage and had sticky pads at the entry way to remove any dust and first from their shoes. They also had a hand sanitizing station and wore masks throughout the move. They were professional, on time, and fast. I highly recommend requesting this team for your move.<//text>

< Review>
I just moved from our 6300 square foot home (16 rooms + 2 stuffed garages!) in the San Diego area to a much smaller home in Encinitas and the Atlas team did an outstanding job moving us!

All 6 guys - Tyler, David, Alfonso, Lewis, Tre and Ernie - were awesome and worked really well together as a team. They were super friendly and helpful the entire time. During the move, I was really impressed with how they communicated with each other and also to us - to make sure everything was moved exactly from and to where we wanted. It was so much stuff since we had lived there for 20 years and there were many details to remember, but they executed perfectly. They kept all the like things together and that made for really efficient unloading and unpacking later on - but I will get to that in a minute.

The process for everything was very professionally done - Traci, you nailed it! First, a detailed quote was provided (by John- thank you!) a few weeks beforehand to set expectations and to buy packing materials, then I picked up the materials from their warehouse in Poway where they loaded me up with almost 200 boxes of varying sizes, including mattress bags and wardrobe boxes. Reminder calls were made by Traci to confirm we were on time, and we even received introduction calls the day of the move to let us know when they were on the way. When they arrived, they all got a house tour and I filled in the crew on details about our particular move. They prepped by throwing down red padded carpet all throughout the house, then they "Saran-wrapped" furniture and other delicate items. After that, they moved everything with padded dollies or by hand. And these guys are super strong because we have a lot of heavy pieces! The boxes were staged in our driveway as the vans on the street were carefully packed.

Not one thing was broken or damaged in the move and that is incredible given the sheer volume of what was moved. I did all/most of the packing myself the week before using their materials to speed up the process - and that really paid off because we ended up only taking 1 day instead of 2, saving us a lot of time and money. I really love the flexibility they gave the lead driver, Tyler, to make that decision on move day - and he was spot on! Once the truck was unloaded, we reviewed the placement of everything and in some cases we moved a few items around to see how we liked the fit -that alone probably saved us from trying to move some heavy things ourselves later.

Also, a 3rd party company subcontracted by Atlas took apart our home gym and did an excellent job: Hector from Moving Specialty Services, thank you!

It's been a few days since our move and we are happily settling in for what we hope is a very long time...but if I do ever have to move again, I'm calling Traci at Atlas. Best movers ever!<//Review>

Local move from a larger inland home to a smaller coastal home.
From start to finish: professional, super courteous and stress-free.
Mike, Travis, Gil and Dustin were not working their first gig. Fast, efficient and  careful, not a ding or dent. Respectful of the heirlooms and artwork, great attention to detail in the pack AND in the placement on the move in.
Highly recommend.  Ask for this crew by name.<//Text>

<user_id>105333328228686867138</user_id><Text>Hector Ortiz and his crew did a great job delivering my home goods.  He explained the process, followed Covid precautions, and laid down excellent matts to protect my floors.  We had terrible weather the day of the move and he and the team timed deliveries and unloading between rain and hail.  They moved the truck rapidly to support my neighbors accessing their driveway.   Itemizing and verifying all items went smoothly.  They even stayed with me for an hour and a half after the move was complete to open all boxes and search for a very important item.  Definitely a good experience and I recommend Hector and his team.< /Text>< pics>

<review>I had a military move and this company delivered my homegoods from storage into my new place. They had a very professional set up with a sanitation station that they sanitized at often. They laid down covers for the tile and carpet. They protected the door with padding before moving my stuff in. They took a lot of care with my stuff and ensure I got it where I wanted. They even moved some existing stuff I had upstairs for me. They reassembled my bed, dinning room table, and reinstalled the legs on my couch. They offered to unpack my boxes to take the packing material with them but I decline. They did take what packing material I had unpack and cleaned up after themselves. Very friendly and professional. I would reccomend and use them again.< /review>< response>

Moving house is a stressful experience but  thankfully Atlas made it a very smooth process from start to finish.  Traci was our relocation consultant and was very helpful, efficient and responsive in providing the quote (very reasonable), associated information and scheduling the move date.  Our moving crew were Michael, Dustin and Gilbert - they arrived on time, were very courteous and professional.  They worked hard and were in and out in 4 hours which I thought was impressive.  The crew were very careful moving our stuff and in particular, they had to bring a large and very heavy sofa bed down the stairs.  I was concerned that someone was going to get hurt or drop the sofa and damage it or the walls/stairs.  However, I should not have worried - these guys are true professionals and just took it very slowly and carefully.  No trouble at all!

I highly recommend Atlas and will not hesitate to use them for our future move.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

WOW. A 2350 mile move across the country can be scary, but Tracy McCormick & Atlas has it covered. Our driver Randy showed up on time, and the team loaded up our stuff taking extra care to wrap everything well, and delivered at our new house on time, unloaded everything and the final cost was about $600 under the estimated. Nothing, and I mean nothing was broken, and nothing was missed. Randy gave us updates on his progress via text, maneuvered the giant truck in our small street both leaving and arriving with no issues and Tracy had everything arranged down to a tee! I can't imagine a better cross country moving experience than we had with Atlas. Do not hesitate to use them. You will be pleased.<//Review>

These folks are the best! Justin came and packed us up for our move overseas. Everything was boxed up and well protected for the trip before he loaded it up into the truck for us. Turns out Justin helped Marina move into her house a few years ago, and he did just as amazing of a job helping move her in then as he did moving us out now. Thanks!< /Text>

Tyler, David, Alfonso, Marcus and Ernie were amazing.  The move was carried through from beginning to end with professionalism, kindness, caring and with efficiency.  This group can move us any day.  I hope we get the same group when our stuff is delivered to our new house. Can not say enough about this team, made moving run smoothly and carefree for my husband and I. Amazing group of guys and strong !</Review>

Let me start this review by saying that moving, especially out of state is stressful. That being said from the start of our search for a moving company choosing Atlas Transfer & Storage was the BEST decision we made!! From the initial estimate with Ashley Dunlap, who was upfront, honest, answered all questions and concerns in a timely manner and was one of the nicest people. The moving specialist Karen Snyder, amazing and patient with me as well!!

The day of the move.. the team that was sent to pack us out was made up of Hector Ortiz, Chris, John and Enrique. There aren’t words adequate enough to express how I feel about these guys!!!! From the initial meeting at the beginning to the last minute loading, every one of them was respectful of not only my family, but of our household and storage items. They all went above and beyond taking great care with our items, and if they weren’t sure about something they made sure to ask. With our many military moves (we didn’t use when as a part of a military move for this particular move) this company is leaps and bounds above every company I’ve had. Hector and his team are beyond phenomenal!!! Explained absolutely everything they were doing, made sure to check that his team was doing a good job!!! Thank you so much Atlas Transfer & Storage for being a stand up, honest and reputable company!!!

Wanted to add.. with Covid happening, the team had a sanitation table set up and had their masks on the entire time! My family and I appreciate the steps the company and their employees take to make sure their customers are safe, as well as them being safe!!<//text>

First of all, I never write reviews, but feel compelled because of the excellent service we received. Traci was our relocation consultant and she was attentive and assuring from the moment we called, until our final things arrived. Moving during Covid 19, plus fires in CA and OR was no joke and she handled the move (and two women and a dog) with a genuine care and concern. Thank you Traci, hats off to you and the entire team of movers who packed us and to the team that unloaded, all folks were excellent, but more than that, each one had a can-do spirit and kindness.< /text>

Great moving company - Alex paid me a visit and wrote up my inventory and a quote.  She was pleasant, organized and patient with all the questions I had for my move out of town. The guys, Mike, Gilbert and Travis, were fantastic! Professional, punctual, clean, careful and fun to be around! They really helped make my move less stressful and easy.  Thank you 😊 I HIGHLY recommend Atlas!</Text>

Moving is stressfull moving out of the country is even more stressfull. Allied made our move to Canada smooth and very affordable. The movers were great they had a great system to getting everything loaded with care. The driver was very professional, provided me with everything I needed to make the customs transaction go smoothly. The driver also kept us updated on delivery status for out belongings. We will definitely be using Allied for our future moves.<//text>

Hector Ortiz and his crew of Chris, Victor, John and Enrique did an excellent job delivering our household goods.

They protected the floors in the house extremely well and practiced COVID safety protocols throughout the day even setting up a sanitation station which was used frequently throughout the day.

We’ve made over 20 international and domestic moves (20 load outs and 20 deliveries for a total of 40 crew interactions) and Hector and his crew rank in the top three.

We would definitely recommend Atlas, and in particular Hector Ortiz and his crew, to anyone considering a local or long distance move.

We recently used Atlas Transfer and Storage for a cross country move. When moving out of our house in San Diego. Joey, Justin, Jojo and Mark were our packers and loaders. Brian Medina was the mover and unloader/unpacker on the Connecticut side. Everyone did a phenomenal job! We have moved A LOT and have never had a move go so smoothly or be so stress free. Everyone was on time, polite, professional, efficient, and took great care of our belongings. They made what can be a very dreadful experience quite pleasant. Overall our experience was excellent and based on the workers we came into contact with, with highly recommend this company!< /Review>

Had a good experience then so I used them again.  Both movers Terry and Michael were on time and very professional, but also funny and happy guys who genuinely seemed to enjoy their work, and they made it fun.  I had many unwieldy, heavy items and plentiful artwork that needed special packing, and they did everything in stride.  It was a very happy experience for me, and well worth the price.  Everything was perfect.  From the beginning working with my Coordinator Traci - who was always available by phone to answer even the smallest questions,  to the special requirements of the destination - everyone was wonderful.  I will definitely call them again if I move again and have recommended them to friends..

Recently moved locally, and we were lucky enough to have the "A Team" help us out. Tyler, David and Tre we're professional, friendly, and paid attention to detail when moving our stuff. They were the perfect example of how a team should work together. The staff at Allied were attentive as well, and much appreciated.< /Text>

Highly recommended!! We recently moved from Southern California to Chicago and had a really great experience with Atlas Allied. I'd use them again in a heartbeat.

We especially appreciated the technology of the virtual, video-based quoting process and felt comfortable the estimate would be accurate, even without them coming into our home (though they also do in-home quotes if you prefer that route). Other movers we considered didn't offer the video quoting or take the time to be so detailed.

Traci and Crystal were awesome to work with and made it a seamless experience. The quote and final cost actually ended up to be lower than alternatives we looked into.

The moving crew was seriously amazing on both ends. Our driver, Jose, and the crew in California took extra caution to ensure certain items (mirrors, furniture, etc.) were packed more securely than we originally packed them. They also took extra care to properly secure our motorcycles.

Jose, Israel, Alejandro unloaded in Chicago and did an awesome job! It was raining when they arrived and they made sure to protect all of our flooring and kept items covered while moving it in. They were all around really nice, professional guys and made sure everything was exactly where we wanted it and re-assembled properly.

I honestly expected at least some hiccups along the way, but everything went incredibly smooth. No broken items, the truck arrived quickly, competitive prices, and everybody was super friendly. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Thanks so much Atlas Allied crew!!</text>

Used this company for our cross country move. They came in and packed up all of our household goods. They answered any questions we had and told us what to expect once we recieve the shipment. They were extremely professional and safety conscious. They set up a sanitary station outside the garage and placed a few sticky mats to prevent them from tracking in dirt & dust. They also wore masks the whole time while packing. I would highly recommend them!<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We were so  grateful to work with Atlas Transfer & Storage and not  unscrupulous movers such as Purple Heart Moving Group. Our Atlas  agent Traci was extraordinary. She was not only personable & professional, but also attended to every aspect of the move with a patient & cheerful attitude. Planning was set up in record time  & communications were easy to understand. She welcomed additional questions & made herself available by her direct line.
Thank you for having Traci on the team!< /Text>< pics>

We moved cross country, a few of our things were left unassembled. Tv’s that we’re removed from stands were left with no screws to put back together, same with tower fans. A foosball table was left unassembled and completely broken in half. Other than that the movers worked extremely hard and overall I’m happy with their work.< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Atlas Transfer & Storage Co. was hired through my employer to move our household from California to Colorado. Everyone was very polite and respectful when dealing with the details to get the move booked. When Tyler, David, Ernie and Tre showed up to pack and load the entire house in one day, I was very surprised. Unfortunately they didn’t have enough boxes for the pack, however, Tyler (the lead) was able to get ahold of a dispatcher who delivered them enough boxes. Throughout the entire day, every single one of them were respectful to my family and our stuff. During this time of COVID, they kept their distance and wore their face coverings to not only keep us healthy but themselves too. I would definitely recommend this crew to come pack and load your belongings. Also to all of you movers, if you take care of the crew, they will take care of you. ie. Have plenty of water and drinks so they are hydrated, buy them their lunch and if they work to your satisfaction, give them a tip as appreciation for moving all of your stuff. These few tokens will go along way when they are working hard to pack and move your stuff without damaging and caring for all of your furniture and belongings.</review>< gmapID>

I’m so glad we found a reliable moving company with all of the scams going on right now. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Eddie the driver was great to work with. He showed up for pick up and delivery as scheduled. I had no problem getting ahold of him when I had a question. Both pick up and delivery crews were quick and efficient. Everything showed up and no damages done. It was worth every penny. Traci was great as well! She was quick with everything from the quotes to revising paperwork to getting a final invoice. Excellent customer service! I’m so glad we chose this company and highly recommend them for your next move. Thank you Eddie and team for the move to Scottsdale!</Review>

These guys at Atlas did a great job! They had a full team (Tyler, David, Alfonso, Marcus, Joe, Ernie and Bobby). They packed my house in one day and moved us the next day.

Traci made everything very easy for me.  I was scheduling the move very last minute and Traci was able to accommodate my needs. There were other companies that insisted on giving and in home quote which was not possible for me. The over the phone estimate that I received was almost spot on!  The truck driver was on time, polite, and very careful when packing, loading, and unloading my things.  Total time from truck being loaded to delivery was 4 days.  The truck almost beat me to the new location!  Super happy!</Review>

Jason, Dave, Brian & Jacob came in on time. I gave them a tour of what to pack and all the details. They were amazing. They start working immediately. They brought there own music (loved the music) and everybody was doing their job. This crow was incredible, respectful and communicating everything they were doing.

We would give them very high marks for their service and support.</review>< Pictures>

<review>From the moment Kip showed up to asses my move, I realized this was going to be a positive experience. I was relocating from San Diego to San Francisco and receiving multiple quotes from different moving companies. I was first introduced to Kip when he came to review my stuff and provide me with a quote and time line for my move. Kip was fantastic! He was detailed, thorough, and provided me with assurance and timelines of what to expect. He even gave me ideas of where to purchase the proper packaging materials. What was also great was Kip gave me his personal contact info so if I had any questions or concerns I could reach out to him directly.

On the day of the move Kip, Dave, and Richie showed up early, packed all my stuff seamlessly in the truck and were done within an hour and a half. Richie was scheduled to meet me the following day in Northern California and was there ready to move the minute I showed up.

Working with Atlas Transfer was one of the easiest experiences ever! They have excellent communication, prices, and customer service. Thank you Kip, Dave, Jerlyn, and Richie for making my move that much better.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>These guys did a great job for us from start to finish. Especially the truck driver (Larry) who is the main man in charge for the move. Larry was in contact with us at all times as far as scheduling the pickup and delivery. He was always right on time. He had a great crew with him in both of our locations who handled our belongings with the utmost care. Thank you Atlas and Larry for making this a stress free move.

Traci, who works in the office. has taken great care of us. She is timely with her responses and always thorough.  Our last move,  Darek and Donte were our movers. They were both hard working and polite. I would highly recommend anyone use this company!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Over the course of weeks in planning, three days in execution, packing, loading, transporting and unloading the entire team at Atlas, Allied & Storage did a fantastic job.  We can not thank you enough!  Trevor, Traci, John and his team in packing, Alfanso (Senior Load Master) and his team in loading, Jeff in transporting the shipment, overall coordination and the team unloading at the destination.  The excellent level of customer service the entire team afforded us is I am sure indicative of their daily job performance and the same level of service they provide to all their customers.  Oustanding!  Thank You Team, You Rock!<//Review>

Having MANY interstate moves in the last 12 years, Allied is the very best.
There are no red flags with this company.  They are honest, dependable and take great care with
your furniture.  My driver, Victor was wonderful!  I recommend this Company highly.<//Review>

<userid>112702188490938912959</userid><review>So when i was moving into my new beautiful home in California i saw this company and thought it was promising. When the guys who were mexican, not that it really matters but just to say their race, were moving my stuff into my home, and this is where it got bad. So, first of all there were carrying the boxes that clearly were labeled "this side up" with an arrow pointing up, they were carrying them upside down, and in one of these boxes had screws and nails that i had worked all day to get them sorted, like there were probably like around 1 nails in each box sorted and there were about 4 boxes. So, from carrying those boxes upside down all the nails fell out of their sorted place and then fell out into other compartments totally mixing them up. This made me furious then when i looked out my window when i was putting boxes away i saw a guy shaking the box then dropping then stepping on it to get over it which seemed very stupid in my opinion to drop a box then step on it to get over to get a different one. Not only that these guys were messing around with my stuff so, i thought they were getting bored and hungry and bought them all lunch and they spoke English clearly but, none of them had the decency to even say "thank you" so by then i just told them to get everything out of the truck and put it in my drive way and leave. After i told them that they agreed then went out and started to aggressively take stuff out and even throw some out of the truck and they damaged and broke my stuff. When they were done they expected a tip but, i refused because of the terrible service, so all in all if you want to be able to tell a story like this i highly recommend this company they really know how to break your stuff.</review><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

those guys are professional and very responsable. They are also nice and very helpful when you have any question or doubt. They answer fast and always try to solve the problem if it is on their hands. Although they have a list of cost for each service they provide, they are not close to negotiate some costs. Overall, this is a reliable, serious and professional company</Review>

I just made my fourth move with a moving a company. This was by far the most positive experience. The move of our furniture took just about the longest it could (2 weeks) but it was within their estimated data of arrival. The moving consultants, Wendy Lopez and Mike Castellanos were great. They were open, honest, and responsive to emails and phone calls. The driver and his crews were responsible and diligent. A couple of things did break but in the whole scheme of things, I was VERY satisfied with the moving experience.  I would use them again for sure!<//review>

This was our 8th international move. Our previous 7 moves went without an itch or a broken glass. This time it was terrible. Service by Atlas SD was choking. They planned two days for packing & loading saying they would finish early on the second day. First day only one guy showed up, told me full crew would come next day. Next day two guys showed up told me all day that more were on the way (a third arrived at 4.30pm).  No communication from head office, when I called no one answered and my rep.was on vacation and unreachable.

Job was done in a rush by overworked crew that worked 14 hour day & finished at 10pm (we missed our own going away party). Result: terrible packing & damages at the other end which could have been avoided if job was done up to Allied quality standard.

Then my final per ton rate increased by 7%; when asked why they said pricing was confidential! They said they deducted $800 for our problems, a mere 4% of total. They had my credit card number, and had my container, I felt like I was taken hostage and there was nothing I could do to fight them.

Then I had to argue for weeks to get a few miserable dollars back from the claim department who refused some of my claims for damages due to improper packing. My leather couch and chair were ruined. I provided obvious before & after pictures they say it looks like normal wear & tear. Pictures speak a thousand words, here is a before and after picture of my leather chair and an example of their 'professional packing'.  Judge for yourself.<//text>

<userid>102384853010618111733<//userid><Resp>None< /Resp><review>It was the first big house move of our lives, and we didn't know where to start. We moved from Riverside County California to Seattle Washington. We called a few other companies, but ultimately always came back to Allied Atlas out of Poway CA. I am so relived and extremely satisfied with their service from start to finish. Tracy was my case worker and her over the phone estimate was nearly spot on. The truck/ driver and helpers showed up early and ready to work hard for the pick up and drop off of my household goods. The driver kept in contact with me via cell phone throughout the trip and absolutely no items were damaged during the entire moving process; including a lot of fragile glassware items and family heirlooms. I would recommend Allied Atlas Transfer and Storage Company to any of my co workers, friends and family; they are top notch professionals dedicated to the highest standard of moving services.<//review>< date>

Moving is never easy. So call Allied, and get professional help. Traci gave me all the options, and my driver Bryan was on the West coast loading, and on the East coast unloading, each time with his local crew. Thanks Allied!</Review>

(Translated by Google) They made me a very good move and with very good service. They maintained the security measures very well due to the covid pandemic. They brought a special table with antibacterial gel and other products to prevent the virus. They put rugs throughout the apartment and that helped a lot to avoid the virus and that the floors will get dirty.

The team that came was made up of Hector Ortiz, Enrique, John and Victor.

Thank you very much

Me realizaron una mudanza muy buena y con muy buen servicio. Mantuvieron muy bien las medidas de seguridad por la pandemia del covid. Trajeron una mesa especial con gel antibacterial y otros productos para prevención del virus. Pusieron tapetes en todo el departamento y eso ayudo mucho para evitar el virus y que se ensuciarán los pisos.

El equipo que vino estaba conformado por Hector Ortiz, Enrique, John y Victor.

Muchas gracias</review>

I strongly recommend JBE Electronics and Appliances. Byron is a very sincere, honest and helpful gentleman. I had scheduled an appointment with Sears but after looking at the problem, I thought to myself this is something I can fix on my own and save money.  I called JBE and spoke to Byron to see if he had the part and shared with him I had scheduled an appointment with Sears. Unfortunately, he didn't have the part.  Instead Byron was very helpful and suggested I look for the part at another store and save money vs having Sears charge a large fee for a small part. Byron could of easily tried selling a new washer but he didn't. He understood its rough financially with our current situation and was very empathic in providing a less expensive solution. I truly appreciate his help. Even though I didn't buy anything, I ended that call with even something more valuable, Byron's words of HONESTY, SINCERITY, and HELPFULLNESS. May the Almighty Lord bless you in all you do!
Thank You!!!

I was talking to the owner about an appliance I was about to buy when I noticed something faulty. I asked him about it and he got very defensive. I got the feeling that he wasnt a trustworthy person and I ended up not finishing the sale. When you are spending $500+ on an item you should be able to ask questions, especially if they have to do with something that can affect the functionality of the item. I went to another appliance place and got a much better deal for what I was looking for. After reading the reviews here where others have said they bought defective items, I feel like I dodged a bullet.< /text>

My husband and I purchased a washing machine here a few days ago. We paid $300 for the machine, $40 for delivery and tipped $20 for delivery. We set it up and start a load of laundry before bed and get up about 8 hours later to a flooded garage. Upon calling the owner to get this sorted out he has my husband take it apart to determine the issue, they figure out what part is broken and the OWNER ADMITS TO IT BEING HIS FAULT. Instead of replacing it or coming to fix it, he has my husband go pick up the repair piece and fix it himself. So on top of the $360 we paid them, I’m looking at a hefty water and gas bill (it was hot water) and I had hundreds of dollars worth of items damaged/destroyed. It came with a 60 day warranty, which means nothing but to cover themselves after they sell you something broken.
Don’t be like me, read reviews! Upon reading their reviews before leaving this one I see MULTIPLE people have been sold faulty products from this place. Don’t gamble your money shopping here, go somewhere else.<//text><resp>None</resp>< username>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Recently brought a Samsung side by side refrigerator from Byron.  The customer service is outstanding. I brought the refrigerator, was delivered, set up and the water was working and making ice within one hour.  We were very impressed.  I try to always use local businesses . JBE definitely deserves the business.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Review>The daughter in the store was very friendly and helpful.  The owners came to our house promptly on delivery date and went above and beyond making my refrigerator fit into the spot I needed. I will definitely refer other customers and would not hesitate to use them again.  I also purchased a washer and dryer.  Excellent service.</Review>< pictures>

These people are great!!! I was in need of a quick fix or replacement dryer. JBE Electronics had plenty in stock and very reasonable prices. I was able to pick out a dryer and they delivered it to my house, installed it and tested it all within an hour!!! Free delivery and install within Moreno Valley, can’t beat that! Definitely coming back for other appliances and highly recommending them!! Thanks guys!<//Review>

This place is so great. They have great deals, they finance AND if you're in the city of Moreno Valley they also ship to your home and remove old appliances for free. This company does repairs as well. This is my go to place. I bought both my washer and dryer from here and I recently purchased a refrigerator. Their customer service is really great also. Of all of the places in MV to shop for appliances I recommend this one.</Review>

<Text>I had 2 appliances that were acting up on me and needed replacements and a fair and reasonable price. I found JBE APPLIANCES and was well pleased with their options and professionalism. Byron was very helpful in explaining to me what the difference in my options. they made me feel very comfortable in my search and even delivered to my home and hauled away my old stuff. Grade A experience. Highly recommended< /Text>< Pictures>

GREAT VALUES ON USED REFRIGERATOR, WASHER, AND DRYER!
Amazing customer service by professional staff. Byron answered all of my questions and then delivered and installed my appliances the same day I bought them.
I bought a used full-size GE refrigerator ($350, 30"W X 30"D X 66"H) that was clean inside and out, a great buy despite two small dents on the right exterior wall.
I also bought a Kenmore washer ($300) and gas dryer ($300).  Each was 27" wide and 27" deep.  The washer was perfect, but the dryer had a bit of rust on the right side where enamel had been chipped.
After a month of looking at full-price new appliances, I was so relieved to find JBE.</text>

I am an older lady and I came to buy a washer that was simple to use and when I came to this store I was happy to see a lot of washers to choose from.The price was fair and because I live in Moreno Valley I was able to get free same day delivery. The two men showed me how to use my washer after they installed it. I definitely recommend them and when my dryer breaks down I will look to them first. Thanks again!<//review>

< review>
Great little used appliance shop, my washer broke down on me and I happened upon this little store in my desperate search to find something quickly and inexpensively. The young woman in the store was very helpful and knowledgeable about the different brands. I ended up purchasing a used washing machine and they were able to deliver and install it the same day. The two gentlemen that came out to install it we're very friendly and made sure it was operating correctly before they left (that it filled, washed, rinsed, and spun correctly). The machine I purchased was at the lowest price point offered but I am still very happy with it, you can see that it has been refurbished but for my use it is in an unseen area and as long as it is mechanically fine, and so far it seems to be, I can't complain at all about the price or service. If you are looking for an appliance in a pinch I would most definitely recommend this shop, I will be back the next time one of my home appliances breaks down :) and the best part is they hauled away my old broken washer at no charge!</review>

Awesome service! They sell used appliances but look pretty good and clean! The prices were pretty fair and the employees were very informative and extremely helpful. Of course since the Appliances are used they don’t cover noises and dent and scratches but their warranty was pretty forward and on top I got free delivery and installation since it was here in moval. You’d think they’d charge the people that live practically on border line perris but they said as long as your address says Moreno Valley your delivery’s free. Will definitely be back in the future for more Appliances.</Text>

<Review>They sold me a defective washer. They offered to deliver another washer to me for a $50 charge. So I opted to have them fix the broken washer they sold me. Then the washer broke again and they told me there's nothing they can do for me. These people are absolute Crooks. Don't waste your time getting ripped off by them!!!!!</Review>< Name>

I bought a refrigerator that lasted 1 year! Now I'm stuck with it! Prices not reasonable,broken productd and and unwillingness to negotiate make them less than desirable. Buyer beware</Review>

I give this store a high 5. From the 1st time we came to the store, we were helped by Jailine. Very honest & sweet--- didnt sound like a salesperson  at all but just someone who helps you make an informed choice. The tandem of Rene & Bayron (father & son team) is superb...from the time of delivery...the quick response on some issues we encountered...all those helpful tips... They make you feel like, "hey, yeah, these are USED appliances & this is how you can make the MOST out of it" not like, hey, yeah, you bought one that is used, so what do you expect?!?  I say, WOW!<//Text>

HORRRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!! Don’t go here. They don’t go by their warranty I bought a LOUDDDD noisy fridge they knew it was loud and didn’t tell me about it. They made it loud like that so they can charge me a fee to fix the noise and it doesn’t work. Looking at other reviews and I’m not the only one</Text>

<text>Horrible!!!! I was asked to describe my experience and that was the first thing that came to mind. I purchased a dryer from JBE located on Sunnymead in between Heacock and Backway right next to a small mom's and pop's taco shop. Cosmetic wise the dryer looks great, mechanically it's a disaster. I purchased it today 3/11/17 and immediately brought the problem to JBE/Byron's attention after being provided a 60 day warranty. Upon purchase the warranty was not honored because I was told that the problem was  cosmetic issue and not mechanical. After contacting multiple appliance mechanic's and explaining my issue with this dryer which has the most annoying squeaking noise that I've ever heard, they all said that it was a mechanical issue and it had nothing to do with cosmetics. JBE STILL DIDN'T HONOR THEIR WARRANTY. If there was a way to give a company zero star's I would. This was the most unpleasant and unsatisfying service I've ever received. The bottom line is that they suck and I would never recommend anyone to purchase anything from this company.< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Terrible and too bad service and coordination, I bought a used refrigerator and they only gave two months of guarantee, days after two months it was ruined, I asked for their help, they were going to send a technician, we were on a schedule and I arrived much earlier for work reasons. I asked for minutes of time (15 minutes) and she did not want to wait, I explained to them that I have a year and a month old girl and I had milk to refrigerate for her that please wait but they still did not understand and Yano wanted to coordinate an immediate repair, service garbage do not buy in this store !!!!

Pésimo y demasiado mal servicio y coordinación, compre un refrigerador usado y solo dieron dos meses de garantía, días después de dos meses se arruinó, les pedí ayuda disque iban a mandar un técnico quedamos en un horario y llego mucho antes por razones de trabajo le pedí minutos de tiempo (15 minutos) y no quiso esperar, les explique que tengo una niña de año y meses y tenía leche que refrigerar para ella que por favor esperara pero aún así no comprendieron y Yano quisieron coordinar una reparación inmediata, basura de servicio no compren en esta tienda!!!!<//Text>

The attendant at the gas station was able to fix our flat tire on our vacation. He took the tire off the car, and took it off the rim. He patched the tire on the inside of the tire.All this took around a half an hour.We sure appreciate his help. Thank you !</text>

Gas is gas except when you're out.  Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells are the only stations in the Park.  They are both a bit more expensive than an urban setting, but what did you expect!  Not exorbitant, but welcome, with standard credit card pumps.  Service for serious problems is likely to require a long tow to Nevada.  Don't come here with sketchy tires or overdue maintenance, and no harm in carrying back up a fan belt and fluids--gas, oil, antifreeze, water, and beer in case none of the above work.< /text>

So after spending $95 to fill my diesel tank with their very expensive fuel, they wouldn't fill my propane tank. This is December, which is a high tourist season.< /Review><Date>1607034279239</Date><pics>None< /pics><Name>Rick Powell< /Name>< userid>

Happy this place was open! No complaints that no one was there or the high prices because when you’re in the middle of nowhere to take what you get and you don’t get upset.< /Text>

<Text>The gas prices can be kind of killer but then there aren't a lot of options in Death Valley National Park so it's great there just is a gas station. The roads down here can be pretty tough on tires so the staff here has fixed several flats for us and dealt with RV battery issues for us in a very friendly helpful manner.<//Text>< date>

They have three grades of gas, plus diesel. Prices are high, perhaps the highest you've  ever paid, but get over it. Unless you drive a gas truck, you will be happy to see this place.</Review>

Way too much for gas. They were 50 cents to a dollar more than other stations in death valley...It is remote so I expect to pay more but please don't just charge so much cuz u can. Maybe it was better in the past (per other reviews) but not in August 2018< /Text>

I was in Death Valley in June, 1970.  It was 124 degrees.  We had to keep the heat on in the car to try to vent and cool the engine.  Stick your head out the window of the moving car... it felt like a hair dryer blowing in your face on high, close up.  Anyone who stays in this location to sell gas to travelers... deserves a bonus/premium on the gas price!  If they are open... and selling gas... service is excellent... I don't care how high the price, how dirty the bathrooms may be!< /text>

Roadsign posted price was not the same as the pump price. Inquired what the price was and if difference was cash or credit and they quoted the roadside posted price. Pumps charged more than roadside posted price. Typically in the $5 bucks a gallon. Most positive reviews are locals associated with he station. Do your self a favor and get gas before this point, Many within 20-30 miles. Dollar or more less per gallon.<//text>

This is a very simple gas station with a clear rule: Refuel here because you won't find any other around and you don't want to get stuck in the desert. Driving thru Death Valley you have to anticipate your gas refuels.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I understand a higher cost for the supply, however I had the strong feeling that the monopoly situation is taking advantage! However, the bathroom is wonderfully air-conditioned.

(Translated by Google) Outrageously expensive at 3.28 / Galone.
They know they can afford it. Around it, within 80 miles, there is only an even more expensive gas station.
The service was good though. We were helped here quickly and free of charge because of a tire problem.

Unverschämt teuer bei 3,28/Galone.
Sie wissen, dass sie sich das leisten können. Drum herum gibt es im Umkreis von 80 Meilen nur eine noch teurere Tankstelle.

The best way to refuel before entering the Valley, then you save those expensive prices.
Even ice cream costs a fortune here.

New Patient and Very Happy! I spent a bit of time looking at many dentists in the area and after thorough considerations, I chose Dr Kiesselbach -and extremely happy. Jennifer at the front is friendly and informative, I felt like she cared about me as an individual. Venus the Dental Hygienist was a pleasure to chat with and very clear about what I should and shouldn't be doing. Dr Kiesselbach herself is so great; personality and professionalism. I definitely give my full confidence to the entire office and trust that no matter what (dental hygiene, billing, dental work, customer service, communication, etc) I will get the great service with a friendly atmosphere.</Text>

I was looking for a dentist that offered IV sedation and I am so happy I found this dental office. All of the staff is extremely kind and helpful. The wonderful receptionist puts you at ease as soon as you walk in.  Dr. Amy is very thorough and takes time to actually get to know you. The hygentists are amazing. Raymond is very reassuring and understanding.  I will be recommending this dental office to everyone I know.< /Review>

I have been going to Dr. Amy at Cedar Dental for several years now. She and her staff are always professional and kind. I looooove my hygienist, Venus. She is a perfectionist. Very thorough. Raymond is always ready with a smile, happy to help with any scheduling issue. They have all made me feel safe and cared for. Highly recommend!<//text>

I’m definitely scared to walk through the dentist doors.  I went here from a referral of someone that used them and had the IV sedation.  He had a great experience.  I was so scared to go.  Went for my first exam.  Set up my follow up appointment and we talked about sedation.  I opted out of that but they prescribed something for me to take an hour before I come back.  After my first appointment with them i felt so comfortable that I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THAT PILL!!!!  They are so nice and made me very comfortable.  If I moved they asked me if I was ok.  The office manager was seriously amazing!  He talked to me about my job & family.  The lady at the desk was extremely nice and really helpful with knowing what to expect.  Very nice office.  The dentist is great!  No pain! Highly recommend!  And if I can go and not be medicated, that’s a huge deal.  Heck, getting me in the door is the hard part.  Amazing staff!<//text>

I am so glad I have the pleasure to know Dr. Amy Kiesselbach. I have no problem with my teeth, until 10days ago. I had an emergency with a molar 🦷. Very thankful Mr. Raymond Takla was able to get me in right away. I had the greatest experience, Dr. Amy Kiesselbach is an excellent dentist, her staff & service was wonderful. She took the time to explain the procedure. She listen to my concerns & my fears making me feel comfortable with the decision I had to make. Dr.Amy Kiesselbach is a professional and has a naturally lovely personality. I would recommend Cedar Dental in Rocklin to everyone. Dr. Amy Kiesselbach is the best dentist I have ever had.
Many Thanks to everyone at Cedar Dental.<//text>

Dr. Kiesselbach and her team surely helped me during an emergency wisdom teeth extraction. Other dentists were going to make me wait for weeks even though I was in agony. Dr. Kiesselbach is my go-to dentist now. One of the extraordinary things I’ve noticed about Dr. Kiesselbach’s skill is her gentle hand. I’ve noticed that with other dentists, they really push their hand on the drill during fillings, causing a cold and painful experience. You can bypass this at Dr. Kiesselbach’s practice.</review>

<review>Do not go to this dentist. If I could give zero stars I would. Not only are they over priced, they also do not give a cash pay discount. Even worse, my husband had a wisdom tooth that was infected and needed to be pulled. He had already gotten xrays at a previous visit and told all four wisdom teeth needed to be pulled, Even though the other three were completely fine. He called for an appointment to get it pulled and they tried to tell him it would be more expensive because the tooth was impacted. It most certainly was NOT impacted, the whole tooth is erupted and has been for many years. Then, they were going to charge him an extra $230 to X-ray the tooth again before they pulled it.  What a scam!! This dentist office is a rip off and will tell you that you need things done, that don't need to be done. We went elsewhere and got the whole thing done for several hundred dollars less and with a 10% cash discount.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Just came back from my second visit at Dr. Amy's office in over a year, and I can say her and her staff are just as wonderful as the first time I saw them. They cleaned and checked my teeth fast, but efficiently, and reviewed the work I'll need done, all within the hour. Venus is absolutely wonderful! It's been a year since I've been there, but she still remembered who I was and was very informative on what she was doing/using, and how to care for my teeth properly. Unfortunately my 7 cavities didn't magically disappear since my first visit, so I do have to go back for more work, but I'm actually excited to get my teeth done here and finally have everything in check! If you're looking for a team of people that are gentle, friendly, and actually care for your mouth health, I would definitely recommend Dr. Amy, Venus, and the rest of the staff.<//Review>

Usually when you go to dentist, doctors etc you expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes if your lucky. Every time I have been I have always been greeted respectfully and shortly after I take a seat they are calling me back to begin. Dr. Kiesselbach and ALL of the staff are Amazing!!! They take time to explain things as well as make sure that you are comfortable. I highly recommend if you are looking to switch dentists or looking for a new dentist this is the place for you.< /Review>

Amy and the team are the most professional group I have ever had by pleasure doing business with.  Raymond is awesome talking to and really makes you feel welcome.  Venus is the girl cleans my teeth and she is an absolute perfectionist and will never let your teeth go badd for reals.  I love this place and as long as I live in California I will always keep going here.< /Review>

It was a difficult day with a bridge problem and a small cavity but they are so friendly and welcoming. I was very well taken care of and I always leave wondering why I had dreaded going to the dentist. Love the people that work there and Dr. Amy !</Review>

<Review>The dentist isn't most people's favorite place to go, but Dr. Kiesselbach is kind and gentle. The staff are all welcoming and helpful. They make me feel like I'm making a friendly visit rather than conducting business.</Review>< name>

Best dental office in town!  I highly recommend Dr. Amy M. Kiesselbach DDS   as a very caring and experienced dentist.  Her staff is of the highest professionalism.  I am happy that I relocated my family for dental care to this office several years ago.< /text>

The staff of Cedar Dental is like family.  Every member of the staff, including my very favorite dentist of all time (Dr. Amy), the smartest and nicest technical support person (Raymond), the sweetest and most thorough hygienist (Venus), the very able dental assistant, and the sharp and friendly receptionist (Trish), all make me feel special every time I come in.  Last week I came in to replace a problematic crown which a previous dentist had 'installed'..  Dr. Kiesselbach and her assistant performed flawlessly and I walked out with a perfectly fitted crown which feels like my original tooth.  The final crown was actually molded with specialized equipment right in the office and immediately fitted in my mouth so there is no return visit necessary. The doctor successfully (and painlessly) extracted four difficult wisdom teeth from my mouth a couple years ago.  I won't say that it was a pleasant experience, but the hug I received on my way out the door made everything just right.  What a team!  Thank you!!</Text>

Absolutely amazing place. Family friendly and completely clean and professional. I'd recommend to literally anyone to come here for the very best experience. I was nervous to get my wisdom teeth out and they talked to me and reassured me that everything would be alright and they followed through on everything they said.<//review>

<text>Dr Amy is without a doubt, the most amazing dentist I’ve ever been to. I’m in my 60’s, and have had a lot of experience with dentists. She and her staff are awesome and beyond helpful and friendly. The quality of her work is awesome,she even has the equipment to make piece onsite! I started going to her 6 yrs ago, I have never had a bad experience. I can honestly say. I no longer dread and panic at the thought of going to going to the dentist. I no longer have anxiety no matter what the procedure is. I have 110% faith in Dr Amy and I believe once you meet her and her entire staff you will too. If you need a dentist  do yourself a favor and just meet her. Signed by a very loyal and happy customer, Loretta.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>5</Rating><Name>Loretta O<//Name><user_id>102581466372831725324</user_id><gmap_id>0x809b222571f3896b:0x469272107c6e881c<//gmap_id><time>1554747617748<//time>< Response>

<review>From my first visit I saw a difference in Dr Kiesselbachs approach and treatment.  I found out I had a teeth clenching issue that I was not aware of and she took pics of the teeth affected and explained what was happening and the treatment.  She also creates caps out of zirconia so you can get a cap replaced w/o having to wear a funky temp cap!  She also does implants.  Very pleased with this office!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I love Cedar Dental they are the best. They make sure my kids are comfortable and have a great experience everytime. They are  about compassionate care and customer service. They adapt to any situation I have two of my three children who have autism and the make sure they feel safe and enjoy their experience. I love how almost everything I have done is all done in house. I had a same day cerec crown and was amazed by how everything got done in one day. I can't explain how thankful and comfortable I am with my dentist and her team. I am so greatful thanks for everything guys you ROCK 🎸</Review>

They submit the insurance claim for me which makes my life much easier. Unlike other greedy dental clinics (e.g. Western xxxxxx) who just want to maximize their profit, Cedar dental does not sell you unnecessary services.

As an "experienced" patient who has lots of dental problems and gone through tons of dental procedures ( e.g. root canal, crown, implant, bridge, etc) in several countries since childhood, Amy is the best dentist I have ever met.< /Text>< pics>

Painless. Dr Amy is very good with those of us that have extreme fear of dental visits. She does sedation dentistry for extreme cases such as myself as well as she had very small dextrous hands which result in less pain, faster trips through the chair and reduced recovery time. I'd highly recommend her practice especially to the timid patient.<//text>

<review>I'm not from the area but went to my friend's birthday party and my boyfriend got arrested I called two other places and the first one kept ringing and ringing. The second place I called said if I can please hold but waited over ten minutes so I hung up and saw great reviews from Absolute so I gave them a call and I was impressed on how fast they answered I spoke to a girl name Brisa. She was very nice. Answered all my questions and gave me a great deal. I don't ever make reviews but I needed to let people know how good they treated me,</review>< Pictures>

I was worried that I wouldn’t get out in time for work. My husband only speaks Spanish and he called and spoke to Tam. I got out fast. Affordable and bilingual. Made my experience quick. Glad he called Absolute.<//review>

If u are in need of a quick bail give them a call they make the process smooth and easy. They also have payment options and they are bilingual so my mother in law was able to understand the entire process the bail agent met up with us the same day and we were able to bail out my husband within hours. Thank you guys for helping us out during this difficult time.< /review>

This was my first time ever bailing someone out of jail, and I'm glad I chose Absolute Bail Bonds. Becky was the bail agent who provided me help and she was wonderful, she's been in the business for a while and walked me through the whole bail process step-by-step. Couldn't ask for better help, thank you Becky at Absolute Bail Bonds.</Text>

<review>I gave these people a call since I came across there page online I was in need of a bail for my cousin who got in trouble couple days ago and We are extremely satisfied I am glad we came across this company first. Not only do they have great service they also speak spanish and my aunt was able to understand the entire process. We had first called the location in santa clarita and they direct us to Lancaster since we do live closer to here and I must say they were extremely nice.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1519072286488< /date><rating>1< /rating><review>I was definitely unhappy with my recent dealings with this bail bonds agency. My wife had some missed court dates, due to my military obligation, causing her to be jailed upon being pulled over recently in Lancaster. I go to this agency and initially everything was ok. She was jailed on a Thursday and i contacted this agency Friday morning at 9am. Needless to say everything was set by 10:30 a.m. They worked me an amazing deal and I was beyond pleased. After waiting 24 hours and NO bail being posted I contacted this agency again to find out that things changed--so they told me. The bail amount increased requiring a higher down payment of $1,000. After finding the money and providing it to them, ALL OF A SUDDEN the amount of the bail decreased back to the original amount. How ironic this was. However, they voided the previous agreement after receiving the additional amount of money and told me that they wouldn't refund it. So now nearly 30-35 hours after my original meeting there still was no bail posted. Monica was the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL agent that i spoke with. She failed to return calls thus causing my spouse to sit behind bars the entire weekend after i made immediate payment and contact on friday, she wasn't released until sunday morning. Thanks to Tamora and her professionalism I was able to get things quickly resolved. It became so frustrating to where i allowed them to keep the additional $1,000 just so my spouse wouldn't be delayed any further. Because they told me "since they have the finances they'd refund it and not do the bail regardless of the signed contract. or they'll do the bail and keep the money."  I belive that i was manipulated to get them more cash and once they received it they wouldn't return it. I felt tricked. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told one would contact me immediately because this issue was unethical and unprofessional. Needless to say it is Monday, and i am still awaiting the call from the supervisor from Saturday. Glad my wife has been released, I'm certain this company can do better--however my experience was ridiculous and unprofessional.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1519403844409, 'text': 'Hi Isaiah. We apologize for the confusion on your wife’s case and for not immediately responding to your request for a supervisor call. Unfortunately the county made an error and added charges that were not your wife’s, but until they discovered their error, we had to go by the information they gave us. We appreciate the kind words regarding Tamara, however, we are looking into the other problems you experienced. It is never our intention to make a difficult situation even more difficult.

My sister in law was arrested, this weekend and she called us to bail her out. My wife called around and this was the cheapest place, they offered us a discount, becausr we had AARP. I thought that was great, ( the truth is my wife asked how to get a discount, she's a coupon fanatic lol). They explained the process, and she was out quick. I would recommend them to someone that needs bail.  Joseph was the guy who helped us out, guy knows his job.< /text>

They don’t even deserve one star.One of the worst places I got a purchase from them and they sell me a broken peace which is not fair for me to pay$600 for a broken peace! I don’t recommend them at all. Don’t waste your money and your time.< /text>

<review>Excellent deals on quartz countertops, including prefab vanity slabs. Sinks are also good quality and very inexpensive. Minor downsides: the building does not (yet) have signage; and the parking lot is narrow, and doesn't have a lot of capacity. Unless you're picking up product, I recommend parking in the street.</review>< Name>

Our counters were awful quality. Scratched up & cloudy. We went to the yard to see if it was just a manufacturing error on our slabs, but all of the manufactured stone they carried had the same issues. Not always, but sometimes, you really do get what you pay for.< /review>

He will show you what it looks like. I ordered 10 cabinets and 3 pieces of quartzite. I asked when could I pick them up and they said that day. I needed a few days. Crazy! They work like a well oiled machine. That night when I got home I discovered I ordered the cabinet over the fridge too high. Called to change, they said just make the change when I pickup.
So easy.</text>< pictures>

H Cabinet is a warehouse, no frills. Everything is on display. They have cabinets, cabinet knobs, flooring, kitchen countertops of various materials, and stainless steel sinks. You browse and select then a rep will help you. If you bring your measurements they will put your cabinet selections in a CAD presentation. They will load your truck and you're done. They also offer cabinet assembly.
The parking lot is small, but it turns over quickly.< /review>

<review>If you are looking for customer service and variety, this is not the place for you. Asking a question felt like you were intruding even though sales person  was just looking at their phones. I was expecting the audible sigh when asking a question, but it might have been muted by the mask, unlike eye roll which could not be hidden. Limited selection and colors. Displays have appliances that look as if they were pulled from a dumpster. Definitely would not recommend.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I would give them zero stars if I could. I read the earlier reviews
and thought I could power through the nonsense. It wasn't worth it.
The worst service I've ever experienced and total lack of professionalism.
They are disorganized and dishonest. Charged me twice for the same cabinet. They are thieves and don't care. Do the world a favor and don't buy from them. Their cabinets aren't anything special. Just more imported junk.
What I got was an order that was split and mismatched. Parts missing.<//Review>

sales people have zero people skills. very bad customer service. Borderline rude.  I shouldnt even place a star.  They is a sales rep with the initials ZW who is a piece of work.  If he is your sales rep...RUN  !!!!!  When I visited the store, I didn't have a good experience.  I thought ZW was just busy that day.  After 2 weeks, I called and while I still explaning, he suddenly he hung up on me while I was still talking.  There is a culture of dismissiveness in their Mira Mesa branch.</Review>

<Name>Insanity</Name><Time>1558449305982< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>This is by far the very WOREST cabinet and vanity vendor in San Diego. Had to complete a BBB compliant due to the serious incompetent customer service by unknown woman that answers the phone who refused to give her name, she admitted to never repling to their emails, voicemail always full, no call backs and lack of professionalism by "Thomas" who refused to allow contact with the owner and hung up 4 times. All for a simply drawer face reorder for a bathroom vanity that the owner paid over $20,000 for the remodel. I seriously recommend not buying anything from this company to save you from the frustration and time wasted. We ended up buying whole new vanity because H Cabinets lack of service.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Customer service is way better at the Scripps ranch store.  This is the second time we have used them.  The cabinets are good quality, but not for the novice.  Think IKEA without the directions. Our contractor put  the first set together for us a few years ago. She had it done in no time.  This time it was just us.  Took awhile, but they look great. I took off a star for the poor quality of the YouTube video that his supposed to help with assembly.<//text>< pics>

They hardly answer their phone.  It usually goes to VM. It's frustrating when you leave a message because they NEVER return a call.  When there,  the gal at the register is rude and doesn't want to be bothered.  She's busy texting on her phone.  My contractor complains when he picks up items,  the guy at the warehouse also has an attitude.  They have no idea of what customer service is!<//review>

<Review>Very poor customer service and poor quality quartz.
I'm very worried about the quality of my quartz. Everything seems to leave a mark, and even on the day of installation there were marks that could not be removed.  I thought they would be buffed out, but nothing changed. I had the installer back, with no improvement. I wanted to rip it all out, but was told that they will not take it back once installed.  I believe my contractor sent me to H Cabinets to save money, but poor quality is not a bargain!  My dream kitchen is anything but! From afar it looks beautiful, but I am afraid to set anything on it, move anything on it, leave a glass of water or coffee cup, etc.  And I am constantly trying to get it to look shiny and new.  Not up close!

The poor service came when I needed an additional five foot piece for a powder room, which I saw outside, but no one was available outside to help.  They said I had to pay for it before looking, then I could get my money back if I didn't like it.  I was to get a paper from Thomas first.  Thomas said I had to talk to the front desk first. Back and forth I went, both locations within hearing distance, in 100 degree heat, and I finally gave in to ordering a whole new piece to get out of there. Probably their original intent. I would never recommend their product unless you are doing cheap house flipping and don't care about the poor consumer.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The worst company I have ever done business with. Nobody speaks actual English. They will get verbally angry at you for asking a simple question about their product if they can't understand the English you are using. They don't stand behind their product. I have been calling for 2 days asking if they have a simple product and they consistently ignore my calls or straight up hang up on me without explanation. I flip houses and have been using them for over a year. They could not care less about me or any other of their customers. Don't waste countless hours dealing with them, save yourself time  (which is money) and go elsewhere!<//text>

Don't go there expecting great customer service. If you want that, go pay three times as much anywhere else. Only thing that gave it 4 stars is they refuse to provide directions. Not that I use them. But I keep ending up with way too many left over parts after building the cabinets and I think someone is messing with me.<//Text>

<review>Absolutely disgraceful customer service, if i was the owner and saw my employees act this way to customers i'd be furious. I've been a few times and every single time they act like I've asked them to perform some herculean task when it comes time to collect my order. Not building the order. Not assembling the order. Fetching the order that was already payed for.

While bad customer service is bad, i'm generally a pretty easy reviewer and a one star wouldn't be warranted unless something was fundamentally wrong with the business. In this case, I've done business with them previously and I had a significant amount of in-store credit saved up. They tried to cheat their way out allowing me to use it by charging nonsensical fees that would have amounted to over 25% of my credit. When pushed, they dropped it.

There are better options in San Diego, a quick search will give you several options. Avoid the headache of doing business with this deplorable company.</review>< rating>

<text>The direction to the warehouse was terrible. There wass no sign, no address, no clear description. The warehouse may be obvious to them but not to customers.

Their customer service was also horrible. They just grabbed your paper and said nothing, no smile, no greeting, The guy sat at the desk treated the Hispanic workers like a mean boss. He called them name, shouted at them.   He has no manner at all.<//text>< user_id>

They shipped the cheaper looking version and will not allow for a return. Furthermore, they sold me the wrong size handles. When I tried to return the handles they stated that they don’t fit even though they picked them out . They sold them to me and now won’t accept a return . They are complete scammers and are not following their own company policy . They are a complete fraud<//Review>< Pictures>

As per the person who posted before me, DONT BUY FROM HERE! Marble cracked in less than a year in so many places, customer service after they have your money is absolutely poor! Take your money elsewhere or else you’ll be like us and spend over 15 grand with a newly renovated kitchen that’s already falling apart!

DO NOT BUY FROM HERE, THEYLL CONSTANTLY HANG UP ON YOU TOO or continually lie when you need help! Believe the reviews because we didn’t check before hand and we’re outta luck now<//Text>

This is a decent sized gym but the men locker room and showers NEED ALOT OF WORK....out of four showers only one is working and there are only two soap dispensers out of four working in the showers or even full of soap for use.....i really wish they would fix the showers at bare minium so that we could stop waiting practically in a line just to shower off......the weight room is fine and the equipment is good but the men locker room shower and soap dispensers need work< /review>

It works for me because it's really close to home. It's a smaller gym with not a lot of classes, and can be fairly busy after work hours. I go before work and it's never overly crowded, and can't beat a <10 walk from home. You also get access to other 24 Hour Fitness locations depending on the type of membership you get. If you're looking for a big gym with a pool and tons of classes, you might want to look elsewhere.< /Text>

<review>FYI, GYM WILL BE CLOSING PERMANENTLY ON MARCH 29TH, 2019.

lose to the bart and not as crowded as 24 gyms in the city, yet men's locker area space is extremely tight. Sometimes smells funky in the basement (maybe it's time to clean ventilation?).
24 staff, put more trash cans in the basement! Put more signs to return weights and use towels! Put a sign that squats racks shouldn't be used for all the other stupid things!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnKEx1jm23jzaVSf426Odt0AdLgsxCsNERbuQm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

Reasonable fees. Especially if you can get the Costco deal or tack onto a friend's account. I love that the classes are included.

Lots of equipment, centrally located just a block from BART, and friendly staff. My only reason for knocking a star off is the locker room/ shower area is pretty old and dated. I'm sure they work hard to keep it clean, but with hundreds of people using it per week, it just feels dark, damp and dingy. I like 6 blocks away so I just walk home and shower.

Overall a great work-out place. I enjoy coming here.<//text>

<Name>Arlene Acuna</Name><Response>None<//Response><text>Good basic equipment but they don't keep the place very clean..
Maybe in part due to the age of the place...and the a/c's are not consistently working or fans not on.. The room where classes are held and we can go to stretch and work with free weights, etc.  is often hot, muggy and stuffy.
Most of the staff at the reception desk don't greet you as you enter...not very welcoming.
Weight room is not monitored well and most times I have to remove heavy weights from equipment I want to use. People often do not return their big and heavy weights back on to the holding stands. Sometimes I ask someone working out to give me a hand, but I shouldn't have to do this.
And equipment often "out of order".
Much room for improvement!< /text></record></dataset><record>

By far the worst location I've ever been to.

No apology, no real urgency to make sure I was ok, and no real care at all. I love to work out but I can honestly say I haven't been going as often as I usually do because I dislike this location so much.

This place is a pig stye. Dirtiest gym I've ever lifted in. I don't mind a little rust on the bars, but this hole in the wall reeks like musk and sweat, has stains everywhere, no ventilation, is tiny, and all of the weights are in a windowless basement underground.

Save your money, don't get a 24 membership for this location.< /review>

Signed up for a 3-day trial pass, went there, and waited for 25 mins at the counter yet still couldn't get in. At the same time two other people were also dealing with membership issues, and neither finished before I finally gave up and left. Front desk staff seemed to be clueless and didn't care about customer experience at all.< /text>

<Review>Been going here for 3 years 4-5x a week, can't say I can relate to those people having parking issues since I always walk here. The staff members are usually friendly with a hello and good bye. I've been to ones back home in LA where they don't say a thing. So any acknowledgment is fine.

Gym:
It's not updated with the newest equipment like other 24 hr Fitness gyms. Probably due to the size constraints of the building and the lower foot traffic than those in the city. It has everything you need to make gains but could definitely use a renovation. The free weights are in the "basement" section where the musk gathers. Even though it may not have the newest bells and whistles it never gets overly crowded and I can get my workout in fairly quickly. If you think otherwise, you haven't gone to gyms in LA...

Bathroom:
Its pretty terrible. The mens stalls are small as hell, like literally shoulder to shoulder inside a piss infested death box. The lockers are standard and no signs of attempts of breaking in. I trust this gym. They do have 2 private stalls outside of the locker rooms for both men and women to use. It comes with a shower, toilet, and sink for those uncomfortable showering around others. That is something I haven't really seen at other 24s.

Overall: It's a gym and if you need all the fancy equipment go pay an arm and a leg with Equinox or Crunch. For 15 a month it works perfectly for me. If they ever get better equipment for every section I would update this to a 4-5 star.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I've been going here since February 2016 and have been going approximately 5 times per week (sometimes 4, sometimes 6). It's definitely a negative change from the previous 24 hour facilities I used to go to in Fremont and Hayward. In fact, I've never been to a gym in such poor condition.

Gym Equipment: It has almost everything you need for a full body weighted workout. It gets cramped at the usual times of the day. Kettle bells are hidden from members and only accessible with a trainer (which I had for a short period of time). There is a stretch room with mirrors, but lacks more space for more full body workouts. At peak times, between 530p-730p you often have to weight a while to get a bench, and definitely always a long weight for a squat rack. There's a lack of plates and I'm always wandering for days to find what I need at any station. There's a lack of space, but there are also a lack of benches for the dumbbell station.

Locker room: Absolutely the worst and smelliest locker room I've ever been in. It is very narrow so it is hard to move in and out or even take out your stuff from a locker to change without being interrupted several times by people trying to pass by. The showers is just a room with shower heads, no stalls, and the there are only two urinals which are always filled with piss and don't flush and two stalls which usually are working but often full.

Cardio: There is one row of treadmills and it's usually generally easy to get one; I've only had to wait a few times and they are in decent shape. The are four stair climbers which are usually full, but the rest of the cardio equipment: ellipticals always have an opening.

Parking: On top of my monthly payment (I pay $49.99 to have access to all 24 hour gyms across the country including super sport), I have to pay about $5/day whenever I come to this gym for parking. At peak times there's just no other choice. It adds up quick and is a pain.

Staff: I read reviews calling the staff unfriendly. I don't think this is true. They all have been friendly and helpful to me. I had a trainer for a short period of time and that was very easy to set up. They all say hello and goodbye. I don't know what people are expecting from the staff.

Overall: You're probably wondering, if it's so bad, why am I still a member? I'll start by saying, I've signed up for the new Club Sport in Berkeley that has not yet opened; I hear it will open in September, but not sure. There are two main reasons: 1) It is the closest and most affordable to where I live, and while I've thought about joining UC Berkeley's RSF (just a little more expensive) I've stayed. 2) I travel a lot, I have to visit Fremont a lot and work in Vallejo; I also find myself in cities across the United States often, and it is very nice to have the option of finding a gym anywhere I go. When I'm staying SF I go to the 24s there, I was just in Orlando and went to a great one there; it's a benefit that would be hard to find with a non-chain gym.

I started this review with 3 stars and as I wrote more, I kept bringing it down because I'm rating the actual gym, not the 24 hours fitness chain which I actually like.<//text><Time>1471235158715< /Time>< Resp>

<text>They did not give notice to my partner that the location would be closing a month after he signed the contract. Now, because of their negligence, my partner is held to a year long contract or a $425 cancellation fee. The next nearest location is in El Cerrito, 20 minutes away. Anyone else having experience with this issue?</text>< response>

<user>115951472159400687267< /user><review>Amazing food and service and the restaurant itself should be one of the most beautiful place in the city. This restaurant has the biggest lunch buffet in the city of San Francisco. Authentic Indian sides and authentic Chinese side, so many choices of food.
We came here for the dinner as well. They do not have buffet at dinner. We ordered from the menu. Oh god! So fresh and mouth watering. My wife ordered Indo-Chinese while I ordered Indian food. I will be going back to this restaurant regularly now.<//review><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1533594736301<//date><username>Halesi Mahadev<//username></record></dataset><record>

<review>A friend and I went to this place for dinner. The food we got was great. The Roasted Cumin Chicken Curry was on point and the chicken itself was pretty soft and delicious. We had the Mapo Tofu N Wild Fish and that was pretty good too, however I felt like there was a little too much ginger for my taste. The owner was warm and took pretty good care of us. This place is pretty big and from the pictures, it seems like their lunch buffet spread is pretty large as well. Would definitely like to come here to try it out one day.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Came in on a weekend around 730pm for dinner.  No one inside, wasn't greeted at the door, and had to make my way through a mob of drug dealers/homeless people just to get into the door.  Got inside and waited about 5 minutes before someone came to seat me.  Sat down and ordered the chicken momo.  Food arrived, but I was hesitant to finish my meal because of a roach sitting on the carpet in the corner near my table.  I asked for a togo box and left.  Food was mediocre at best, ambiance was not great, and the journey to get to the restaurant was unpleasant to say the least.  Most likely will not come again..... Unless of course I'm starving and I'm packing a gun for protection.< /Review>< pictures>

I had dinner here last night. The food came really fast and fresh. I loved their bullet naan and goat curry. Momo was phenomenal. The best among many in the neighborhood.<//Review>

Garlic naan and butter chicken are pretty good, but most are burnt. The sizzling salmon is overcooked too.< /text>

I like their Hakka noodle, chicken momo, general tso chicken and Szechuan wild fish with tofu.
All came so good.
The service is so good.< /review>< Pictures>

Hakka noodle and wild fish with sour vegetable is my everyday favorite. I also tried their coconut chicken curry and cabuli naan. I am also a chef but my hats off for the chef here.</text>

Lunch special. Owahoo! So fresh and generous portion. They give rice, naan, salad and dal free. I wish they give some dessert too.
I will return with many friends next time.< /text>

AVOIDABLE.  Poor decor and ambience.  It’s just 4 months old but looks like it has been not maintained for ages.  Ordered sweet corn soup, but were told not to order it as it had eggs and without eggs it would not taste good.  Ordered Bamboo and beans soup which was basically a random hybrid of daal and potato curry !!  Paneer spring rolls looked like paneer pakoda (though tasted okay).  When we ordered hakka noodles, we got chopsuey !!  We were told that in sweets they had ras malai and kheer. We ordered ras malai only to be told that ras malai had spoilt and hence no more “servable” or “edible”.  Kheer was described as Nepalese kheer containing fried rice !!
We were the only 2 customers in the restaurant for the duration of our dinner.< /text>

I have never tasted such horrible food. This place was the worst. We went for their buffet - almost every indo-chinese dish on their buffet was bad. Their general tso chicken tasted burnt and sweet. Their schezuan chicken was chewy - no words to describe how chewy and bland and dry it was. Their noodles were so cold - it seemed like they had just taken it out of the refrigerator. I told the server and she told the owner who came to us and told us that he will get some fresh noodles to our table. Well that was only said but not done because we kept waiting for the noodles to come. Their saag paneer was the worst I ever tried. Their gulab jamun was not cooked as the center was hard and raw. The only good part of the food was the masala tea. And the owner was also very friendly. But that could not make up for the disaster the rest of the food was. I have been to several Indian restaurants all over the country but this place has to be put on a pedestal for serving the worst Indian and Indo-Chinese food. Surprising they are in the heart of downtown. If they don’t improve their food quality, this restaurant will not be able to compete with other established restaurants nearby. Overall, a horrible experience.<//Text>

I heard a lot about this place. Finally I had luck to visit today.
I had momo chili while my bud tried momo chili as appetizer.
And then, we had Hakka noodle shrimp with tandoori fish and cabuli naan. The taste is still hanging on my tongue. Loved everything.< /text>

<text>Awesome finding in union square. I felt like I was inside a real palace. Beautiful setting with delicious food and beautiful service.

We first ate paneer chilli. We had that flavoured paneer chilli in Kalakatta. We ate Hakka noodle, roasted cumin chicken, shrimp fried rice and bullet naan. The level spices, texture, and portion - no complain. I am a pastry chef myself and I also know food quality and taste more than general eaters. This place is mind blowing.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This is a nice setup. Very spacious. If you would want to organize a party or get together, it serves ideal. Friendly staffs. Nice lighting. Noteworthy food is awesome, serves Nepalese and Indian style cuisines. Last I attended to a party and I was very pleased with the service, food and other hospitality. Try it out folks.</Text>

Have a hard time giving only 4 stars, just because the charburger was so good and the price was great. The drive through line was long (again due to good food at a good price) and slow. Give yourself time if its busy...or better yet use curbside pickup!😀< /Review>

<Review>Update: they refunded my order and were nice about it so I feel less bad now, will give them another chance in the future.

Burger was burnt and smells weird. I feel kind of sick after eating only half of it and had to throw the rest away. The lid wasn’t on the shake right and it popped off when I picked it up (from the middle gently, not even the top) while walking up to my house so the whole thing fell. Disappointed because I usually like the habit but I feel sick from eating the food today... $20 for a burnt burger and a shake with an unsecure lid. I usually would go here often but I won't be back. This isn't the first time I've been disappointed (cold or burnt fries in the past, fries today were alright). Too expensive and a waste of time and money today, I worked a 7 hour shift and treat myself to this and it sucked. Too bad.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc834096efa5f7:0xd9a943f159b77fd6</Gmap_id><rate>3<//rate>< Date>

There were 5 adults and 3 children in my group. Without exception,  we all enjoyed our food.  The grilled ahi tuna on ciabatta bread was our favorite sandwich. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were delicious.  Employees were kind, attentive,  and safety-conscious. Tables were sanitized after each use. We'll be back!< /review>

Like when I first step into the habit, I obviously know I’m going to wait around 7 minutes especially because the food is cooked to order. I hate when I see people acting so rude towards the employees, it’s like they expect to be treated like some royal gods, like cut them some slack. The food is good and worth the wait, ain’t their problem your in a rush and don’t have time to wait. As long as my food is hot and fresh and served to me with a smile like it always is I don’t mind waiting. Btw that French onion char is actually pretty good. It’s one of my favorites and if not the Santa Bárbara with some onion rings or spicy green beans are always a good pair and worth the try. Thanks habit for another great meal<//text>< Date>

Always good food, fast service and friendly staff. What I like the best is that you can tell the manager Martha knows how to run the business. She stands out from the rest of the staff and I’ve come here several times and I notice she always waved and welcomes me from the kitchen and others regardless of where they are, I always feel welcomed even with my complicated order. Thanks you guys are the best<//review>

<text>The family did drive thru here a couple weeks ago and unfortunately they didn't help the way we normally get served at the Habit. It took about 17-20 minutes to wait in front of the store for 2 regular burgers and 3 kids nuggets to get made. I don't feel it was too busy and I think it was just an accident, but I will be choosing to go to other locations in the future (Murrieta Hot Springs or Haun Rd).</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I made a large order so they had me wait out front in my car. 45min later still no food. I understand it is made fresh but I think over an hour wait is pretty ridiculous. A girl came out and apologized and offerered me a free drink and said the food will be right out. That was 20 min ago....still waiting for my food.</Review>

Burger / sandwiches not so much. Pretty messy greasy, and leaves you feeling unhealthy after you eat. Fries also taste just a bit off.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Ordered golden fried chicken sandwich, was paper thin, like 1/4” thick, with rubbery breading.  NOT acceptable at all for a $9 chicken sandwich. You know where It is acceptable? Burger King, for a 99¢ chicken sandwich. Looked nothing like the picture of a thick, juicy CRISPY patty. (Update) Thought the basic cheese burger was safe, was wrong.  This location terrible. Done going to this place.<//Review>

After leaving drive thru I realized  my sweet potato fries didn't get rang up so went inside. They also forgot to give me the kids drinks too!! Glad I went back in to get my fries. Staff are really nice and food is delicious 👌< /review>

The burgers here are absolutely amazing. Even the veggie burger is delicious and I'm not a vegetarian. It's nice being able to order tempura green beans instead of french fries. It's usually busy but that's just because it is so good<//review>

They forgot the dressing for my wife’s salad. Drove all the way home then all the way back to sit in another hour line because they wouldn’t open the door to bring out the dressing for the salad. Also tried calling but the operator is not located in the actual store. So what is the point of having a phone if you cannot speak with anyone inside the store anyways!?<//text>

<text>Fast friendly service. Good variety of meals and drinks. You can eat somewhat healthy. Go early as it can get crowded.  A very good alternative if you are looking for a Burger, salad, or chicken sandwich. Don't pass by this place.  Parking can be an issue, but they do have a drive through.< /text>< Pictures>

Was very disappointed. We almost always go to In-and-Out for burgers but wanted to try something different. Well their service was fair, food was average at best. Shakes were good. Usually I judge cleanliness by the bathrooms but in this case I didn't bother since the kitchen was in full view. The kitchen floor was a mess. Fries all over, surprised someone didn't fall. Last but not least, prices were high compared to other establishments for what we ordered and received. Quality and quantity just was not there! 😔</review>

Good burgers, different sides. Not exactly fast service. Which means it isn't pre cooked. I'm okay with that.< /review>

<review>Always a great pick! The Habit is one of my all-time favorite burger joints. From the Santa Barbara Char-burger to the Tempura Green Beans, this place has a good variety of indulgences, and healthier options. If you've never been, I strongly suggest you try them out.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Tonight (the day before mother's day) I felt like having a really good hamburger. My husband suggested the habit. They are very reasonably priced and they even have sweet potato fries!! Off we went. When we were ordering the gal behind the counter heard someone in my party discussing how it's too bad the hamburger he wanted doesn't come on sourdough. After she was done with my order she said she could change any hamburger to sourdough. My son and husband were happy campers and I was one happy momma. And you know the saying, "if momma ain't happy; ain't nobody happy". Momma was happy! The food came within 5 minutes hot, fresh, and perfectly done. The sweet potato fries were delish and the onion rings and garlic fries added to a very pleasant dinner. I think the Habit is going to become MY HABIT! Lol...</review>< pics>

They always get my to go orders wrong, or an item is missing.. also saw one of the cooks use a tissue to wipe her sweat, didn’t wash her hands and proceeded to make a burger. The Menifee location is the best.< /Text>

I like their burgers but I LOVE the grilled fish sandwich!  Their sides are great too, sweet potato fries or tempura green beans.  Some of the best onion rings around.  For non-meat eaters the portobello mushroom burgers are really tasty.< /text>

Delicious food, can sometimes be a bit too salty, especially the bacon burgers. A good portion of the time though, they nail it. I like the Santa Barbara char best. Shakes are OK.</text>

<review>New restaurant in town. Clean and new age interior has good vibes. I'm a burger/sandwich guy and boy is this a good value. Very fair and competitive pricing. I will be eating here on the reg. **update** after 5 visits, the new store is still holding up. They get a lot of business and it might be hard to get a spot to eat during high volume times.<//review>< Pictures>

For Fast food their burgers are great I personally like their grilled chicken sandwich on wheat with grilled onions and teriyaki the best, never had a dry one. Now the Golden Chicken sandwich is hit or miss and can be dry. The sides are good, the onion rings and tempura green beans are my go to's. And the Santa Fe Cobb salad is great. Also keep in mind that if you are in a hurry for say lunch it can take longer than your normal fast food place to get your food.</text>

Their burgers are of great quality and tasty, but it's their tempura green beans that I crave. I do have to say that this is the only place where their fries are still good when cold.< /Review>

<Text>For Fast food their burgers are great I personally like their grilled chicken sandwich on wheat with grilled onions and teriyaki the best, never had a dry one. Now the Golden Chicken sandwich is hit or miss and can be dry. The sides are good, the onion rings and tempura green beans are my go to's. And the Santa Fe Cobb salad is great. Also keep in mind that if you are in a hurry for say lunch it can take longer than your normal fast food place to get your food.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dc834096efa5f7:0xd9a943f159b77fd6< /gmapID>< user>

Didn’t get what I ordered through the drive thru they got my order all wrong went inside, mind you I’m on my 30 min lunch , after waiting in drive thru for 15 mins the women who “helped” she said I had to wait 7 mins for my food at the point I couldn’t wait any longer so I asked for a refund still no apology or nothing and was also extremely rude</Review>

<Text>Poor quality meat.  After trying the Santa Barbara char burger, in comparison to quality of meat, Inn & Out is by far better. I would choose Carl’s Jr. meat over habit.
I’m sure habit’s fries are better.</Text><Rating>2</Rating>< GmapID>

GREAT FOOD & SERVICE! My wife and I were heading back home to Solana beach after visiting her Mom nearby. We Googled food and thankfully a Habit Burger Grill came up about a mile away.The place was very busy when we walked in the front door around 1.30pm but very quickly it was our turn. I even had a quick chat with one of the managers named Brittany while waiting in line. Another manager named Dave served us very efficiently at the cashier desk when we ordered a Teriyaki Charburger and a Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich on sourdough with Teriyaki Sauce.We found a booth table at the rear of the eatery and very soon our food pager went off.Our lunch tasted very fresh, full of quality ingredients, very well presented & most of all...delicious! It was very relaxing to sit in a pristine store and enjoy a very nice lunch before recommencing our long drive home.</text>

In keeping with supporting my local businesses, I went thru the drive thru and tried a portabello burger combination with the mango ginger tea and a cesar salad with tri-tip.  The price was great and the food even better, definitely will go back.<//Text>

I like the food and how the seating is arranged but a little pricey for an "okay" burger. The fried green beans are pretty awesome.<//Review>

Manager doesn't believe in 2 registers open,
Always always only 1 register open and slow long line back to doors. Bad customer service for letting this happen all the time.< /text>
