There's a lot of activity and facilities for the residents of that's community that the residents have no reason to stay inside and sit on a couch to watch TV the when day. Dance lessons, tennis, swimming, pickle ball, ping pong are just some of the things in the program. The ping pong hall located at the Thurs floor of the community center is awesome, huge and well lighted with about 30 tables. The centerpiece is the 3 nine-hole golf course, well-maintained fairways and greens. There are no water hazards but the bunkers are well placed. Lengthwise, it is fair and set up is challenging. This is a great community and a great place to retire.</Text>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>I like Laguna Woods because I live here and in 2005 it was the least expensive place to live in Orange County. The activities and resources for healthy living are too numerous to mention. The main drawback I see now is the aging sewer system and the restrictive attitude of the leadership and Village Management Services. Don't let that deter you from checking it out. We have adjusted and things do feel very comfortable. Like all things in life YOUR attitude will determine how your day goes! God bless!<//Review>< pics>

<rating>1</rating><text>I would have rated with a negative 100 if there was that option. But, Worst possible management I have ever experienced. If there is a dispute consider yourself unheard, not listened to, and ignored completely! And that's just as a family member! The way they treat the residents is even worse.  A sorry bunch of management who have no regard for anybody outside of their bunko group. And if your younger and have better hair don't bother stating your case as they have already made up their mind. Oh!!  and if you have had to visit this place for any kind of parking ticket to a disturbance of ANY kind, be sure to check your resident  family member(s) mail. You are bound to find some astronomically large fine they have to pay.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The owner took us to the community office, to begin paperwork. one of the staff members with very short gray hair looked at my mother with so much racism. It shined thru her face. She made my mother feel aweful. The place has a lot of amenities but not worth it! We decided not to rent from this racist place. Taking my money were mother is going to feel normal and comfortable.

We have lived here now for 3 years. This place was the cheapest in OC to purchase a ok place. It has changed for the worse during these 3 years. The board is doing all they can to make it difficult to sell your place. The administrative fee when you purchase a place went from $2.500 to $5.000. Laguna woods village is a very FEE HAPPY place. There is fees for pretty much EVERYTHING.......and yes the HOA FEE is $652 and will go up again this year. Like someone said they are trying to make this in to a 5 star resort - that will most likely not occur, but in the mean time they sure are trying. When we retire we will move, can NOT afford to reside here. It almost seems like there is more rentals than owners living here. Also lot of mean ladies living here, when you walk your dog they can very well come out from their 'cave' and be nasty. Chose carefully which gate you want to live in.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I made a big mistake in the choice I made to live in Laguna Woods.  My HOA is $650.00 a month which come out to be $7,800.00 a year.  The area s dirty, cracks in sidewalks, the board members bully and abuse senior citizens verbally.  Google Laguna Woods lawsuits and there is a YouTube as a community member recorded of board member bullying a resident.  In Google you will also read about a certain member doing not rights things with association money.  In Google you will see an article about board members throwing objects at each other and police had to be called.  The golf course is nice while the residents live in homes with water leak, sewage backup, sewage smell in you home.  It's worst than you think.  Board members have nice lawns, throw their power around and fight among themselves and do not give a damn about residents.  You can live less expensive place where community is keep nice.  Roots from tree have buckled sidewalks as they do not maintain.  LAGUNA WOODS HAS GONE DOWN AND THE HOA FEES UP.  If you are retiring, you can save more money getting older instead of getting older while your money depletes faster as they keep increasing dues. Please do your homework and beware if you are considering Laguna Woods.  One moe comment.  Even some of the workers speak to the senior citizens as though we are nothing.  BEWARE.  The got my money and now I'm stuck.</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) There are dozens of clubs suitable for the elderly, swimming in the gym, playing table tennis, tennis, golf, singing, dancing, card playing, etc. The community fee is relatively expensive, but everything is free. Membership must be reserved in the door and the doorman controls strictly. The free bus runs in all directions to the city's shops around the community, 6 miles from the Laguna Beach. The resort is as beautiful as a garden. Long-lived centenarians are everywhere. It is an excellent retirement place for American elderly. Known as".

各種適合老人俱樂部幾十個，健身房游泳打乒乓球網球高爾夫球，唱歌，跳舞，打牌等應有盡有，社區費比較貴，但一切免費，進門來訪定要裡面會員預約，門衛把持嚴格。免費巴士四通八達到小區四週市埸商店，離拉古納海邊6英哩，渡假村內美如花園，長壽百歲老人比比皆是，是美國老人的上乘退休之地，有“上帝的後花園之稱”。</Text>

I like this place! They prepare superb dishes, they have a rich menu, The chef in that spot is very trained, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The dishes are consistently fresh, the service towards the customers  is friendly. I frequently visit this place and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend this place.<//text>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>Small flavored french fry chain in a Small outdoor kiosk at the Americana Mall in Glendale. They are famous for their flavored fried potatoes, similar to how flavored potato chips are, they add flavored salt powders to different kinds of fries (french, tots, curly, sweet potato, etc). They also make very good fried chicken. In general potato corner is the best of the flavored fry places edging out their competitors (like Salt & Fry and Fry Yay Fries)in quality, speed, and flavor. This location is very fast as they make a large amount to quickly get you your food but that also makes it not quite as fresh as the Santa Anita mall location in Arcadia, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. But this one is still far better than competing companies.<//Text>< pics>

Kids love this place, french fries in different shapes and flavours... who knew? :) tried couple of times fun food and fun working environment for few young kids and they were friendly and looked like they knew what they’re doing ;) prices are good. Everything was clean service was quick and professional. Good job guys. Right in heart of Americana in beautiful city of Glendale! Thank you!</text>

Worst experience of my life witnessing my toddlers 2 year old and 3 year old having diarrhea, throwing up, screaming in pain, shaking and sweating from this. Never again will I buy from here. Please clean your stuff or wash your hands make everything so this won’t happen to anyone else or any kids since every kid loves fries. The feeling as a mother to not be able to do anything and see your kids in pain is the worst feeling ever.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Came here because I'm a big love of French fries. Tried the sour cream and onion flavor and it tasted kind of weird because I was so used to that flavor to only be with potato chips. It was good but was totally thrown off because I kept thinking I was eating soft potato chips. It was good, don't get me wrong, and I'd definitely come back to try the other flavors< /review>

<Text>Various styles of french fries that you can have covered in various "flavors". The concept seems ok but the execution leaves much to be desired. The fries taste like frozen fries from the store and the flavors are as about natural as you'd expect. Save your money and your stomach and pass on this place.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0ff1cb0cd5f:0x2d0961b7081b8eab</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I didn't enjoy the place at all, and now am in the worst pain i have felt since i got my leg ripped open. THe food was overpriced, and you didn'y have much to choose from. the employes were not very undertstanding as they don't know that when i say medium, i mean mega. This review isn't out of hatred for the place, but I don't recomend dining here. You can get much more value out of meals like in and out.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The first time I ate there I ordered chicken wings, they gave me chicken tenders- im intolerant to gluten. The second time I went there, they gave my order to someone else even though I was standing right there after they called my name and someone else's at the same time. I got late to my class because they had to make it again not to mention they wasted more time discussing with each other what went wrong while I was waiting there. The employees are not organized or punctual. Also, They should label their boxes with the names so they don't mix them up when they decide to call 2 names at once.
Other than that the food is great.</Review>

Customize your fries! Best thing ever!
I wish the franchise would open up a few locations in Bay Area!

First - You get to choose a type of fries you want. Such as regular fries, curly fries and sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries are the best!

Second - Pick a flavor! Cheddar, Chili BBQ, BBQ, Sour Cream and Garlic Parm. My two favorites are cheddar and chili BBQ. The cheddar is pretty much plain and simple while the chili BBQ has quite a kick!

Third - Pick a size! Jumbo (small), Mega (medium), Giga (large)

The guy at the register was super friendly, nice and suggested good recommendations. Sadly, they ran out sour cream and garlic parm, the two flavors that I really wanted to try. However, the customer service from the guy was great, so I settled for cheddar.

This snack is easy to eat on the go and definitely not health friendly. If I lived in SoCal, I'll probably be grubbing on Potato Corner weekly!

Potato Corner is special because you literally can customize to your heart's content!<//review>

<Text>This potato corner is awesome. There was a line to get our potatoes. Got 2 jumbo sizes: the crisscross sweet potato fries with sour cream and onion flavor AND tator tots with chili bbq flavor. The sweet potato fries were good by itself...but i dont think it mixed well with sour cream and onion. I think i would get the tator tots with sour cream and onion next time. Chili bbq was good. Not too salty or too spicy. Just right. Awesome potato corner!!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I've been going to this market ever since I could remember (so has my mom). If you're new, sign up for their membership I believe you earn 3% back for every purchase. My mom usually waits until she has a lot saved to where she could either cash it out or purchase an item! Super friendly and convenient!<//review>

Not a lot of variety, but it will do when no other Asian market is around or open. Their produce section is limited, and they don't have much of a dairy section. Oh, but they're hot food is really good! Get there between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. if you want hot fresh food!<//text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I ordered a bowl of goat birria in what they prepared for me, I went to the bathroom which is super dirty all splashed with urine, the birria plate consisted of 4 pieces of spine, the super hard meat could not be detached from the bone, less chew .
I had to stop and pay literally leaving the food intact, I did not dare to take it to my dogs.
The worst imitation of a goat birria
What is to be admired is the value they have to dare to sell that kind of food.

Horrible Food

Ordene un plato de birria de chivo en lo que me preparaban, pase al baño el cual está súper sucio todo salpicado de orines, el plato de birria consistia en 4 pedazos de espinazo, la carne súper dura no se podía desprender del hueso, menos masticar.
Tuve que pararme y pagar dejando literalmente intacta la comida, no me atreví a llevárselo a mis perros.
La peor imitación de una birria de chivo
Lo que si es de admirar es el valor que tienen para atreverse a vender ese tipo de comida.

Horrible Comida<//Text>

My sister took my mom to process my brother's passport on 12/11/18. The woman had the worst attitude, when my mom asked for help with the application after something was wrong on it, she annoyingly said she could not help. She was not friendly at all. They had to go back a second time, it was the first time she processed a passport here in the U.S. and the worker expected her to know all the fees. They had to go get a money order since apparently they don't take cash there and when they got back they needed another money order for the processing fee and picture which wasn't mentioned the first time. Pricing signs would help and a no cash sign too. Very disappointed. Will not be returning. Some people need training on better customer service. I processed my own in Santa Barbara and it was great loved the friendly environment helpfulness.< /review>

<Name>Dawn Martin</Name><Text>Like all Paper Sources the Woodland Hills location has all kinds of fun items for your party or gift wrapping needs.
They have the most beautiful and unique papers that you can choose from as well as seasonal decorations and other fun little items.
They have cards and a place in back where you can figure out stationary for weddings and what not.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

People here are very nice. It is the most convenient gas station for me. They have drinks, snacks, lotto and liquor. I do not fill up here because for me Costco is the best place for gas but takes longer so I stop when in a hurry and put a few bucks in.</Text>

<text>I needed to pull in because a warning light came on and I didn't want to stop on the freeway.  I'm happy there is a gas station right off the freeway and they had what I needed, but the positives end here.  I understand a fee for using credit or having a minimum, but it would have been nice if this was posted.  Don't know if spending a few bucks more would have negated the fee, but the person behind the counter was occupied with a loud phone conversation (in a foreign language, but it sounded personal) and wasn't too interested in helping me.  Prices seemed high/exorbitant (but it is a convenience and if you're stuck, you pay), location looks dated.  Would only stop in again if I happen to have an emergency and this was the only available option.<//text><rate>2<//rate><userid>108543670078346302783<//userid>< Date>

I went yesterday,09/05/2017 at 11 p.m. to use the air pump for my car at this location. The office was closing already. I tried to use the pump but i couldn't do it. The office worker went outside to go home, and saw that i have some problems, and even he was out of work already, he did his best to help me. I didn't ask his name, but he is from Iraq. Very nice guy. Will definitely go there again<//review>

This douche bag is the reason Mary's had to move. He somehow purchased the property and wanted to triple their rent. Don't buy anything here. The real Mary's moved to 8959 Carlton Hills Boulevard.<//Text>

< review>
We just had our wedding there this past weekend and let me tell you it felt like I was in a dream. The Venue is all inclusive except for the photographer and officiant, which is perfect if your a busy person like me and my husband. For being all inclusive we felt their prices were more than reasonable as well. We had multiple meetings and communicated with Heather and Melissa in order to get everything put together and to get an idea of what we wanted and you can tell they knew what they were doing. On the Day of the rehearsal and wedding Kristina Helped coordinate and she was amazing! Hidden Hollow is definitely a hidden Jem!<//review>

Hidden Hollow is such a gem tucked in the hills.  Backstory, we had to plan a last minute family event and Heather and team really made it happen. The event space offers such a unique and serene vibe, it was exactly what we were looking for. Everything was so well organized and Heather offered so many tasteful touches with the flowers, decor, and setup. Our guests loved it, especially the golf cart rides. We can't thank the Hidden Hollow team enough for their help and hard work coordinating our event.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This review is longggg overdue for a place as wonderful as Hidden Hollow. I got married in April of 2019 with only a 5 month engagement and a unique vision. Heather, Melissa and their team not only brought to life what I couldn’t but they EXCEEDED what I could have ever hoped for in a venue. When I came in, I described what I wanted as a “birthday party but for a wedding” lol. Other people thought I was crazy and couldn’t imagine what that would even begin to look like but not Heather! She saw the vision and ran with it! Her and her team created a bright and colorful confetti DREAM of a wedding. Going above and beyond to bring to life what I could have only dreamt of.  They were extremely kind, creative, responsive and honestly, super affordable for the quality and quantity of service! I can’t rave enough about their quality team and vendors they provide. They made this process so easy, kept us up to date throughout each step, they are very thorough in the details and were super flexible for this spacey bride. If you are looking for a family team that truly cares about their couples and takes so much pride in the details of their work, this is your team. I will forever rave to everyone about the hidden gem we found that is Hidden Hollow!!<//review>< Pics>

<review>Hidden Hollow is the most breath taking place I've ever seen! All my guest were amazed at how beautiful it was and kept asking me how I found such a stunning place. They went above and beyond for me on my wedding day and made sure I was happy with everything they did. They offer so much and are easy to work with! My wedding day was perfect and I give all the credit to the ladies and gentlemen who put all their hard work into making it that way. Thank you!</review><Time>1505360965153</Time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
It was a nice place for a marriage to take place with a nice outdoor wedding and indoor (ballroom looking) reception. I will say the location is in the middle of nowhere and the indoor reception area is a little small but overall it's a really nice and amazing venue!!!!! They even gave us a free ride down from the reception area to the parking lot on a golf cart, that was fun!!!!</Review>

Looking for our venue for 2019. This place is nice and quiet. Out of the way of main streets. Very nice views. We may book this place. Has a lot more potential to become even more attractive to book bigger and elegant weddings</text>

Beautiful spot for a wedding. Very far off the beaten path, which makes it a bit difficult to find but at the same time makes it even more picturesque. The food was also not bad.</Review>

<Text>I don't where to start. From the parking service to the photo booth this place is lovely. The scenery is wonderful and calming, and the vibe here is tranquil. We got a ride down to the ceremony by one of the the owners, who was cordial and kind. The food was good, and the service was awesome. The servers were professional and polite. The bathrooms were clean. There is a lawn with giant Jenga and a bean bag game. There's even a shrub that looks like Mickey mouse. There was even a fire pit that had been set up for s'mores, this place has a bit of everything. I would not mind getting married here or just coming for another wedding!</Text><user_id>102921602555056398853< /user_id>< Name>

Hidden Hollow is the most beautiful indoor/outdoor venue I have visited. It is a lovely place for a wedding ceremony and reception. Heather, the coordinator is amazing and Classic Catering, the caterer, is delicious.< /Review>

Very beautiful. Only problem is they had gardening going on while we had access to the Bridal suite. They also had a tour going on which I thought was odd, because it kind of takes from the intimacy. Besides those hiccups, you get amazing views from every inch of the grounds.</Text>

I arranged for my daughters wedding to take place at Hidden Hollows, I did so because they offered an all inclusive or full service venue which meant less stress for myself and the bride, this was a HUGE plus. Once we booked Hidden Hollows we only had a dress and photographer to worry about, literally EVERYTHING else was handled. Not only was everything handled but it was done at what we found to be reasonable pricing. Time is invaluable and what we saved by not having to call numerous vendors (Caterer, DJ, Security, Bakery etc) was well worth every single penny. We booked a year in advance and had plenty of time to ask questions and work out details. My daughter gave Heather the “vision” for her wedding (bling, bling, and more bling) and Heather took that vision and turned the venue into the most grand place we’d ever seen. Our guest list was right at 200 and we’ve personally heard from a majority of them to let us know either  how beautiful the venue was or how delicious the food was. Yes it’s a short drive, but GPS gets you there no problem, UBER & LYFT were both available for guests who preferred not to drive and hotels were only 15 minutes away.
I highly recommend Heather, Melissa, and her entire staff to any bride/groom and especially to those who prefer to enjoy their engagements without the hassle of wedding planning!! My daughter was the happiest bride ever and most of that was due to the stress free wedding, thank you Heather & Melissa<//text>

Great experience with USA Logistics and the awesome movers! Their pricing was very reasonable and there were no surprise fees, etc. They took great care with everything and completed the job quickly. We will definitely be calling them again the next time me need movers and would recommend them to anyone!<//review>

Close to criminals

Up charged me once all my stuff was on there truck.

Pay cash or USPS cashier's check on delivery? Most likely tax fraud going on

Missing boxes and stuff was clearly riffled and reboxed very poorly

Damaged goods

Delivery was delayed a month since they "recorded" the delivery date wrong

See pictures of how my boxes showed up

If there other customers out there that got hurt by USA Logistics please post a comment and we can seek to create a class action. These people need to put out of business.<//review>

Wish we could put down zero stars. This moving company gave us an estimate and over charged us upon arrival. Our haul was delivered late, they broke many of our furniture and very expensive workout equipment. A few thousand dollars in missing items, damage of our belongings as well as damage to the walls of our rental home when unloading. It looks like they tried to glue our very expensive hand crafted console table back together. A few hundred dollars worth of work ladders and party chairs and table missing. Unfortunately we missed the mark for the extra $99 full coverage insurance so we were only granted a little under $250 back per their insurance company. We could have rented a huge rental truck and did it ourselves for less. Let me note that we have been waiting for our reimbursement check since May of this year. All attempts of obtaining this from the company have failed.< /review>

<Text>This company is terrible. At first they underquoted me ($2000) to move from CA to NC even though I sent them a picture of everything I was transporting. When they come to pick up my stuff they charge close to $4000. They kept my items for more than two weeks in a storage because they couldn’t find a driver. And when I tried to contact the guy who quoted he ghosted. They didn’t want to deal with me anymore. They also broke a few of my items. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR ITEMS!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Steve Kuss< /user_name><text>These people are not to be trusted. They pull up on moving day and informed me it will be 2 times amount told on the phone. And at that point we were stuck, we were moving across the country and had already sold our house. They packed the truck in such a way that it filled up a 26 foot truck and he tells me welp, that will be $17800. Funny thing is, when my truck arrived at my new house it was only filled to about 15 feet, same stuff, same size truck. Some of my stuff is broken and just general moving damage I guess. Should have stuck with my original plan and used a different pack it yourself trailer. Never again would I use Vanguard Movers or USA Logistics.<//text>< pics>

*This company tried extorting me*

I'm pretty sure this company is just three kids in a trench coat. I picked the even though they had like 3.2 stars at the time, and I mentioned it on the phone during the booking process and the guy just tried to rush past it, should have turned away right there. We agreed on a price and after they loaded my stuff into the truck they tried to extort me for twice the amount. I adamantly refused and they said they'd have to unload the stuff onto the street. I said go ahead but they backed down. Oakland - Atlanta move, my stuff was delivered a month past the due date. Their "support center" is just a thin veil to keep customers in the dark. My stuff was always "just about to get shipped out". I finally did get it all in one piece, but I hope no one has to go through the process I did.</text>

Wow these guys were amazing. I moved from Modesto Ca. To Lindon UT. these guy were great you know how moving can be a little nerve racking but the lady Caroline in the office was great. She communicated with me threw out the hole moved. She really put me at ease. When the delivery had arrived I was very pleased by the way the gentleman had wrapped my belongings. They handled my stuff accordingly and with care. I will definitely be referring USA LOGISTICS TO MY FRINDS AND FAMILY.<//Review>

<Name>CJ W</Name><Time>1601229646885</Time><Rate>1</Rate><text>We were very excited to use USA Logistics throughout our initial conversation with the salesperson. Very personable, friendly and ultimately “sold” us on their timeline, quality and guarantee that we’d have a great experience. It’s been anything but that. To put things in short, our stuff was picked up in CA on July 26th and delivered to Texas on September 3 at 11pm (outside their contract of 21 business days). They never communicated that our truck was late and lied multiple times and said it was on the way.

The company picked up our items July 26th and the mover coordinating it verbally guaranteed it to be to our new home by August 1. He said if we weren’t there it’d be $350 a day for them to hold it. After waiting around all day August 1 and 2nd, we called Monday and they said the truck just left on August 2nd and that it will be 5-21 days from the date selected to deliver (which is in the contract). Okay- our bad for not verifying the contract I suppose, but Nicole assured us it would be there by the end of the following week (around August 14). No prob. Still hadn’t heard from the company on August 11th so we called and guess what- the truck was still at their facility and hadn’t left yet! Nicole said our stuff would get there when it does before the 21 days and to have a nice day (hung up on me after a heated discussion). After many more similar phone calls with no information or confirmation when our stuff would arrive, we finally were able to speak to the CEO, Ben. He had no care for the lack of communication we received and hung up on us 3 times before we could have an adult conversation where he wasn’t patronizing us.

In all, they showed up 3 days after their window and were unapologetic. At one point, due to us calling daily and threatening calling the DOT, they threatened to turn the truck around and said we could pick our things up in CA. After they calmed down we negotiated a small refund. When the delivery guys came at 11pm 3 days late they told us they’d lost our things and only found them when they cleaned out the warehouse! Why our stuff even left the truck after they assured us it didn’t upon pickup is a mystery to me.

As other comments said there is no communication, reliability or customer service provided. Our emails have been left unanswered. I also noticed the owner only comments on positive reviews thanking people for their feedback. That is the kind of service you will receive from this company unfortunately.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN68pSrcjJfd_tR4ElNvy5TsQlnKZABZbE6wU73=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi4OoSGhwmd1CtE2KvetGwZ3RRRQou3JQCH2C4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNq32QEhePPRObYLJwTp6_5A_y1TQ0ymiJpTmX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzO2Twaj3hld7tgnXY_6HvSrZs0HsJJ8OxYpB5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO64QqiHTDQmnZeN-DiXQspn3h_25z1Bq1sWkuX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE23PCT4dpRL9-PiaBTChaTH-yevVEu19HhuiG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyaiNqw2gfy_Ixwcn5uWfQf1FECS-phphgQYdo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2954822c34209:0xc2f7c8bb36aafd31</GmapID></record>

DO. NOT. USE. THIS. COMPANY.

How the BBB has a better score is a lie an absolute lie. They do not respond, they change contracted dates even if a house closing date is contracted in.
Horrible company. Scammers. Don’t ignore these reviews.<//review>

This moving company was contracted through Cross Country Movers to move a small amount of furniture from California to Louisiana.  I will never use either of these companies ever again.   USA Logistics were late in picking up the furniture from our house (arriving well after dark) and then the items went into their storage for 2 solid weeks before they even began to assign it to a truck to be moved.  The contract clearly stated that the furniture had to ARRIVE  in Louisiana on a certain date and it arrived 7 days later.  This only occurred after extensive pressure on our part to honor the contract and move the pieces- with no thought to scheduling on the other end or any inconvenience in receiving it.   The warehouse staff were rude, unapologetic and completely unwavering in the "don't care" attitude that the furniture would be 7 days late.  The receptionist hung up on me twice and the manager threatened to take the furniture all the way to New York and deliver on the way back.  They were terrible.  The untimeliness of the delivery meant that I had to fly to Louisiana to receive the furniture (they were unwilling to accommodate a work schedule).  The only ray of light in this stressful experience was the goodness of the driver (who had nothing to do with scheduling).  So, if you want your furniture to arrive on time, DO NOT USE USA Logistics or Cross Country Movers who contracted them (and then did not return calls or emails.)  Terrible.</review>

On October 29th, 2020 I contacted USA Logistics with a request for a quote. I received an immediate answer from the inventory that was requested by me from Steve. The quote was  $1644.59 and $389.00 was paid immediately by myself via credit card. I was under the impression that this move would be handled professionally, quickly and accurately.
The pick up date was scheduled for November 3rd, 2020 at my storage facility, Chipman Relocation Services. The storage facility closed at 5pm and I was told that the movers would be there well before this time (12pm noon) and that I did not have to be present at the location. I arranged for the storage facility to have the storage pod unlocked and readily available for the movers. The day before the pick up I was informed by Steve that myself or someone I knew had to be present. This was an extreme inconvenience since I was out of state. I made arrangements for my girlfriend to be present at the given pick up time 12 noon on 11/3/2020. At 4pm on 11/3/2020 and no communication from the movers I had to try and locate the movers. I was told they would be there by 4:30pm. The storage facility was closing at 5pm so they had to move my open pod to the street. When the movers arrived they said I had way more items than what was on my inventory. My girlfriend agreed to take these items with her. The movers still insisted that my space was much more which was not accurate. They insisted on me paying an additional $1500.60 on top of the remaining $1316.59. This was extremely unprofessional and never before discussed. I had to make the payment or they threatened to leave and my storage container would have been left unlocked in the middle of the street.
After my items were picked up I had no communication from the movers and no one would help answer my question as to when my items would be delivered. Finally, I received a call on 11/9/2020 that my items would be delivered on 11/10/2020. When the movers arrived one mover would not wear a mask inside my home which again is unprofessional and unsafe. I began to unbox my items over the next couple of months and started to realize how careless and reckless USA Logistics had been with my personal belongings. I noticed a lot of items missing and broken.

<rate>1< /rate><Text>If I could give 0 stars, I would. I used their services to get a quote, measuring nearly every box, every piece of furniture, and other miscellaneous items down to the inch in order to obtain a good solid estimate over email. The pick up was 2 days late, the crew lead moved all my stuff to the driveway / street, and THEN gives me a cost $1800 above the quoted. I had no choice but to pay. They charged for “packaging” my bikes but just threw them on top of other stuff. When the driver arrived, he charged for going up a flight of stairs when it should have been included. BUT I fought them via my credit card company and got back a big chunk of the deposit I initially paid. If you’ve been scammed, it may be too late to get back all of your money paid by cash or check, but document carefully, stay even keeled, and meticulously present your case to your credit card company. Hopefully, with enough people doing that, these guys will learn the lesson and hopefully be out of business soon.< /Text>< Pictures>

Gave me a date range for a move, never showed up. You'll never talk to the same guy at customer service again, won't answer. "Couldn't find" my reservation after calling multiple times. Finally ended up refunding my deposit after insisting the days that followed the planned move. One of those scam movers that lost me valuable time and money. Pass.<//Review>

For me, this is a way of giving back to USA Logistics for their outstanding moving service. I don’t know how we could have moved with everything intact without USA Logistics. They were super active and maintained a constant line of communication throughout. We heard a lot of our friends complain about moving in the past and we did everything to make sure we had a good experience. Thankfully we found USA Logistics before embarking on this journey. If you are looking for something similar, then I highly endorse USA Logistics for its exceptional service.< /text>

<review>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Would give zero stars if I could. I hired them to move me from Az. to Or., paid my deposit and set up a pick up date. I told them I had a specific day I needed them to be there and they told me it would be no problem. They rescheduled 3 times and told me I needed to extend the lease at my apartment to accommodate their rescheduling. On the day before my pick up, I had to contact them and they assured me they'd get back to me with a pick time for the next day. They didn't, and when I called back, no one answered. I had to get rid of half of my belongings and ship the rest to myself using UPS Ground because I HAD to leave that day as I was driving to Oregon myself and started work in 2 days. I contacted them asking for my deposit back and didn't hear from anyone for a week. I then had to threaten legal action if they didn't refund my deposit that day. At no point did anyone contact me to apologize, when I received the refund there was no apology in the email... I should be compensated for all of the belongings I had to replace due to their unprofessionalism. A move that should have cost me $1400 ended up costing much more as I couldn't take any furniture with me and had to replace ALL of it and had to spend $750 to ship myself 10 boxes of my essential belongings.< /review>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><review>Do NOT use this company. We were in such a hurry if only I could go back and research this company to see their record.
We settled on them after they guaranteed they would beat some of the other moving companies prices and would be professional and timely.
This was definitely one of the worst experiences I have ever had with a company.
They were given photos of almost every item along with lists and filling out their inventory papers.
They gave us a price that we agreed upon and we contracted them to show up in a day to begin packing our belongings. They postponed the next day, rescheduled, and then postponed that day. They finally showed up and tried to come at 5:am. We put them off until 6:30 not wanting to disturb the neighborhood.
When they came in they started taking furniture apart and wrapping it. About halfway through the lead guy came to us and said we had more things and since it was based on cubic feet, he would have to charge us about $5,000 more. We argued and told them we had settled on a price, only to have him tell us it was only an "estimate". Since the furniture was all taken apart, half of it wrapped, and we had to leave the next day we took off some of the items and settled on $3,000 more. That is insane in itself. They delivered today about 3 weeks later and this turned out to be one of the worst days imaginable. The driver kept calling me because he was lost.
They finally arrived and started demanding cash for the balance even though I had a cashiers check for them. They would NOT accept that and would only take cash even after I talked to their dispatcher.
When the unloading started, the horror began! The furniture was all so damaged it was crazy. We are lucky if we got away with one piece that wasn't totally destroyed. We called the dispatcher and the headquarters in California and their response was literally disgusting! They could not care less and were VERY ignorant on the phone,
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! Where is the government oversight on these moving companies?? I am going to pursue actions against them to the ends of the earth.<//review>< pics>

When nobody calls you and leave numerous messages, find another number on google you are told your move is for 6/3.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They were contracted through Top Country Movers (I won't go into those people who initially lied to us to get a sale). But this company not only list our items, but 80% of our boxes were destroyed as if they tossed them like footballs. First they lost items, and we got them back three weeks later, and we are still missing three to four boxes. They don't care at all. Their attitude is "file a claim" which we all know they will haggle over value. Pieces of furniture broken, two of which were sets of furniture that cannot be replaced. I have pictures and documentation of all items they destroyed along with the boxes that were broken. We were given the dispatcher's cell phone number whose name is Diana, and she could care less. We asked for the owner/manager's name and no response. We intend to file complaints with ALL appropriate agencies including BBB, Attorney General and Dept. of Transportation.< /review>

Gave me a low price.  Arrived a day late, and after loading, everything told me I owed an additional $3000, even though they loaded less than what was agreed on. When I did not agree to pay this extra amount, they left all my belongings on the street, and I was on the road with all my household items.
HORRENDOUS COMPANY

THIS IS A BIG SCAM COMPANY. PLEASE DO NOT GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THEIR LESS QUOTE PRICE; THIS COMPANY WILL GET YOUR BUSINESS WITH LESS QUOTE PRICE.
THEY WILL ASK FOR DOUBLE MONEY AFTER LOADING THEIR TRUCK WITH YOUR HOUSEHOLD ITEMS AND LEAVE YOU NO CHOICE.
VERY RUDE STAFF!!

PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVERS!!<//review>

Do not use this company. Called a number in Vegas that was supposed to be USA logistics but got routed apparently to this company. The reviews of the Vegas company were 4 stars but this rating doesn't even do it justice.

Had a pick up scheduled for may 21st with an accurate accounting for the quote and a reasonable number. stuff didn't get picked up till the 23rd where the movers told us it would be an extra 3-4k with 3k due at pickup because we were "over" our estimate. Our 30 day move out notice was already almost up as was our two week notices at work, so we felt like we had no choice. Movers told my wife if we weren't there at the drop off destination by June 1st, they would charge us 100$/hr till we got there but that was our arrival day anyway so we didn't worry about it.

Come June 3rd, called the dispatch number with no answer. Called multiple times, left multiple messages, got ahold of the estimate guy who said he'd send an email, called the manager number who said to keep trying the dispatch number. Finally on the 10th call, June 7th, I was polite and asked where my stuff was to find out it was still in the pick up city and the lady would have no idea when it would be shipped.

Starting to get a little frustrated and asking if I could send someone to pick up our belongings, the lady started getting rude and passed me on to her manager. Upon getting to her manager, he proceeded to yell at me about why I was "bothering his girls" then hung up on me.

2 days later, my wife called playing good cop and was told that our belongings would be picked up 2 days later and shipped, with a call to us when picked up.

June 17th comes around, still no call, I reached back out and was told again our belongings were still not picked up but that they would let me know when they had a truck headed to our new state. 2 days later we called back and were told again that in 2 days our stuff would be on the way and we would receive a call.  Past that now, still no call so I did a bit more digging.

This company lost their BBB rating because they are notorious for intentionally damaging belongings, stealing belongings, and committing fraud. There are 3 addresses associated with this same company in California, but if you go to street view, you can't see their building anywhere.

Filing police reports first thing in the morning for grand theft as they've stolen over 10k from us. Don't trust this company and if you are reading this looking for hope about your belongings, I'm sorry but we are in this together. Sad that people like this company can take advantage of hard working people who are trying to make every penny stretch. There is a special place in hell for them.</review>

We scheduled for May 28th. The fine print (NOT. Obvious) stated there could be delays. They rescheduled for May 29th, and then they said that STILL wouldn't work. Then they changed to June 4th (today), and NO INTERACTION WHATSOEVER up until TODAY. Now, they wanted to move until June 5th. YET AGAIN, they reschedule for June 7th??? These people are scammers. Do not use them. We had to call probably 20 times and we couldn't get through except for MAYBE 3 times.< /review>

<Review>Please do not use this horrible company...we hired them to move from California to Texas. We were quoted one price and on the day of pickup we were told the price increased by $3,000. Very unprofessional crew picking up our items.  We were told our items would stay on one truck for the duration of our move to which we found out later our items had been loaded and unloaded at least 3 separate occasions.  Were told our items would be delivered on a certain day which came and went with no communication from the company. When the office was called they were extremely rude and unprofessional including hanging up on is when we asked where our items were. At one point we were told our items were in Texas for delivery, two days later after no communication, we called to fond our an update to which we were told “oh, your stuff is somewhere in New Mexico.”  Finally after 30 days of waiting our stuff finally arrived.  All of our boxes were damaged, destroyed and some were upside down.  Numerous items damaged and/or destroyed including an expensive motorcycle. They are the most worthless company on the planet. Please check out complaints against this company on the Better Business Bureau website and please, please do not use this company.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I'd got quotes from multiple vendors, but ended up choosing USA Logistics for our move based on price and the follow up from their senior sale guy Steve D.  It turned out the the D stands for dishonest.  Moving companies are a tad shady generally at the lower end price points, but even with that expectation, these guys were just awful.

Long story short, they just didn't show up.  They were scheduled to arrive between 10am - 11am.  At 12.30pm I called to find out what gives & was told that the driver had a bigger than expected move prior and would now be arriving around 3pm.  A little while after 3pm the driver called and said he'd arrive around 5.30 - 6pm.  At that point I called the company again, to be told that it was the fault of the people they were moving earlier...  I would be to differ at this point.  If you have experience why on earth would you set an expectation so likely to be broken.  Either way, the dispatch team weren't helpful and took zero responsibility.  Around 6pm we received a call from the driver saying he would arrive around 10.30pm.     At that point I told him not to come and to have someone contact me from the office.  Around 10pm he followed up with a text saying he could arrive around 5am or 6am the following day, to which I responded with a window of time that would be acceptable...  and that following day I never heard back.  Npt from the driver, not from dispatch not from dishonest Steve.

I waited two days before emailing again, in the meantime I found another company that picked up my belongings on three days notice.  After my email, again no response from anyone, until that is, I got a call from the driver.  He let me know he was en route and was an hour or so away...  he was dutifully informed that I wouldn't be using this company, so he hung on me.  On the positive, I did receive a full refund on the deposit a few minutes later, though I had already disputed the charges with my credit card company.

The summary is that this was an awful experience all round.  It's a family owned business apparently, so let's just hope they manage their family better than their business, I would doubt it though.</Text><Name>Simon Moorby<//Name>< gmapID>

These people are absolutely criminals.  They tried to charge thousands more than the agreed upon price once they had everything loaded and threatened to dump our belongings if we didn't pay.  When they showed up weeks late, they demanded $2,000 additional and would only accept cash.</text>

I read the negative reviews about USA Logistics, honestly I thought about it twice when it came to hiring them. To my surprise I can not express how amazing they were, specially because is never easy for anyone when they are moving, I had to work til the very last day they came to pick me up and I had not had real chance to pack most of my belongings, they showed up and saw I needed help and helped me pack and didn't charge me. Taylor the moving manager was amazing at explaining all the details of the move. 3 days after the move i called the office and spoke to Carolina and she was such a doll, she provided me with the info i needed. I truly have nothing bad to say about this company, they never gave me a reason to complain, I made sure I read all paper work and the initial estimate, all was clearly explained on paper work and the one thing i needed clarification on i called the office and they were amazing. I do recommend USA Logistics, they have a heart of gold and make moving easier. Thank you very much <3</text>

<rating>1</rating><text>RUN!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!  Really wish I would have read the reviews!  The sales person or broker? Steve D was super friendly and totally lowballed the price. BEWARE!!  After several emails and calls the pick up for my out of state move was scheduled for a Friday OR Saturday.  THIS should have been my first RED FLAG.  Everyone else can give you an EXACT move date.

They said they (or the actual moving company?) would call the day before to confirm a time.  After calling and emailing several times with NO ANSWER by Saturday.. NO CALL!!! NO SHOW!!! Now I am left to frantically find another company to move my office out of state.

I am waiting for a refund of my initial down payment. Hopefully they will come thru on this.  NO ONE should have to go through this STRESS of waiting for a moving company to show up.

HORRIBE EXPERIENCE!!!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>This company is absolute garbage. They underquote you then try to rip you off as soon as they (finally) pick up your stuff. No one on staff has any clue what anyone else says or does. It’s been almost 2 weeks since they picked up my stuff and I have not heard a single word.<//Text>< Rating>

Packed well but their estimate was over $1,000 off of what the actual price ended up being. Someone needs to be better at their estimating job. 1/3 higher than quoted.<//text>

“THROW IT AWAY”
That’s what UAS Logistics moving company told us to do with the items that were delivered that weren’t ours. IF YOU HAD ITEMS DELIVERED BETWEEN 01/18/2021 - 01/31/2021. Please find a way to contact me.
Start to finish do yourself a favor and DONT use them if you are moving.
They quoted us $4,500 and attempted to charge us $10,000. That’s where they first get you. Once your belongings are loaded on the truck it’s to late then. They literally said “tough luck”
They charge extra per item that needs to be handled with care. Then they 7/10 times break that item anyways.
Left holes the size of a soft ball in our walls at our rental. 2 to be exact.
They will tell you you items will be delivered in about 5-10 days, then they will not only be late but inform you they have 31 days, while your kids are sleeping on the floor. Their response to that? “What are you in a hurry?”
When they delivered my items they not only talked down and disrespected me and raised their voices at me in front of my kids! They refused to put the items back together which they also charged extra for. And after all is said and done and your are missing items and everything is broken and you attempt to return the items that aren’t yours. They will BLOCK your calls!!

Please share this with anyone looking to hire movers in California! These people are 100% trash!</text>

< Review>
I had booked a moving date with them. At first they were eager and professional but never showed up on the scheduled moving date. Never called, never communicated. Trying to get in reach with them was nearly impossible and when I did, all they said was we will call you back. 3 days after the expected shipping date , I got through  and they said the mover is running behind and will pick it up tomorrow. I had already left the house, as the items were at a relatives at this point. Then on the day of , they called saying they have to cancel the move and will issue a refund. They did process the refund same day, so that is all I can say that is positive. This delay caused me to then book another mover and have to make extraneous arrangements. The delay was not the issue, it was the lack of communication and professionalism. To cancel nearly 5 days after the expected pick up time date. I suggest for anyone research movers or look at reviews first before picking them. No one should be stressed out with moving. That is why we pay for the service. Best of luck to all those that do move and go with another company that can do the same thing in ease.<//Review>

<review>I have never experienced such a thing... I had them take 10 boxes from CA to NJ. They came 1 month late. Then for the day they are supposed to come they come 6 hours late. They show up and say it needs to be paid in cash even though that was not the agreement. Because we didn't have cash at the moment they tell us they are going to put the boxes up for auction (mind you he is yelling at me the entire time). While I went to get the money he left to deliver some other boxes...Hopefully he actually comes back! I have never had such a poor experience with a company in my entire life.< /review><user_name>Enzo Couillens<//user_name>< Date>

<Review>Please please please do not do not use this company. We hired this company to move from California to Texas and the lies begun. They quoted a price and then the price was under quoted due to the amount of items we had, So the price went up drastically. Then we were told that our item would be delivered on a certain date and low and behold they weren’t. Then we asked when our items would be delivered and they didn’t know.How in the hell do you run a business and not know where somebody’s items are.  The office staff is extremely rude after they Real you in. We were lied to multiple times and hung up on because we were rude to the office staff aka Carolina,  Lupe , Carla, Tanya, they were the worst after they got our money and our items were in there possession. They held our items for over 30 days before they were finally delivered. When they finally delivered our items most of the boxes were destroyed and stuff falling out of the boxes. We had multiple items that were damaged including a motorcycle and they will not fix the items or replace them. I could go on and on about this worthless company but again please I emplore you please do not do not use USA logistics worst moving company on the planet.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>If you want a company that is unreliable, uncommunicative, disrespectful and dishonest, you’ve come to the right place. I cannot overemphasize how untrustworthy and unprofessional this company is. I have a hard time believing any of the positive reviews here are real. I booked them weeks in advance for a long distance move from CA to MO with Steve, lured by the low price and the “family owned business” he touted. They never showed up. Never. They were scheduled for a 3-5 pm window on 8/13/20. Then on the day, I received a call from Carolina saying they would be there at 6-7 pm. Then I got a call at 8 pm from the “truck driver” saying they’d “gotten stuck downtown with a broken elevator,” and could they come in the morning at 7 AM? You can imagine the pattern emerging. To summarize, they never showed up, even after I was promised by Carolina three times the next day that they’d be there. I was also promised calls from the Supervisor to discuss the situation, who never did. I eventually had to leave, since I was 8 hours behind schedule, but my roommate confirmed they never arrived. I never got a call from anyone with an explanation, or an apology. Thank goodness I used a Discover credit card, and got to dispute my deposit. Pay the extra money for a reputable company. The stress isn’t worth it. I’m posting this to Yelp as well.< /Review>< pics>

Please learn from my mistake, this company are big time SCAMMERS, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!!!! They are dishonest beyond belief!!!  They use sales folks that draw you in by saying things that are patently false. They then send a supervisor with a crew to your house, the supervisor spends a great deal of time buttering you up which his "I'm just a humble boy from a small town", he talked about his girl friend who wants to go to UCLA for nursing (surprises of all surprises, both my husband and I are UCLA graduates) and asks for advice.

Part 1: Packing and Picking up The Furniture:  I'm covering my dealings with this USA Logistics in two parts.  The packing/and pick up of furniture    and personal belongings in San Diego, and the actual delivery to my new home in San Diego.

When I first contacted USA Logistics,  I spoke to a man  named Steve D and  was told that the company was family owned, they do not broker the move (get independent movers to handle the move) and further, I would be dealing with the same crew from pick up to delivery.   I was quoted 12K for my move.  I asked for a binding fee moving contract and was sent the contract after I sent him an email requesting a fully executed agreement. I also sent him an email advising him that I didn't want to be nickeled and dime to death and if they couldn't do the move for $12,00, I would cancel the agreement well within the 7 day cancellation clause in the agreement. Steve D. assured me all was well and sent me a copy of the agreement.  I paid the initial charge of 2.6K, pursuant to the agreement they had me sign,  the ageement also provided for payment of half of the invoiced amount at the time they picked up the furniture, the remaining half to be paid upon delivery.

They moving crew came to my house and after they were done loading my belongings in their trucks they presented with with an invoice for moving services in excess of 42K. The didn't even honor their agreement to pay half of the fee as they had agreed to the the contract. Instead the required us to pay 28K.    I sent then emails thinking they had made an honest mistake.  They contacted me only after check cleared.  Now they are trying to extort an additional 10K to deliver my belongings.

Part II:  Another crew showed up today, a crew they had brokered to deliver my stuff.  The boxes they packed on the front end weren't labeled, they had thrown stuff in boxes without wrapping things, small tables were broken, dishes and glasses were broken, and my husband and I have only opened a few boxes.  The crew couldn't find the legs to the piano that they had removed and the screws to the beds so we can't sleep in my home tonight.  I intend to sue them and report them to the BBB.

. Folks, don't get taken in by this company.  This appears to be a common practice for them as you can tell from the review.  They are scammers, from the supervisor who was clearly part of the scam to the guy I was told I had to speak to by the name of Sean.

If you're moving I don't care where you're moving but if you are leaving one state going to another I urge you to NOT USE USA Logistics!!! This quite possibly is one of the worst moving companies I've ever dealt with in my entire life. I left California on November 10th 2020. They pick my stuff up on November 9th with a need-by date of 01 December. I'm not asking for the world here, but I was told that they have up to 21 days from the need by date to get me my stuff. I got my stuff eventually on January 12th 2021. On top of that, they broke my 55-inch big screen TV, broke my dresser and my armoire. They couldn't follow directions when I told them that they were going to have to get a smaller truck than a semi to deliver to my house. Every time I called the customer service was terrible, they couldn't tell me where my stuff was at, and they were very short and wanted to get off of the phone as quickly as possible. I urge you to do your research, because Angie's list is not always the best place to look. Please for your peace of mind, do some extensive research before you have someone move your things. Find a company that cares about your stuff as much as you care about your stuff, because USA Logistics does not care about your stuff! They are based out of Los Angeles and they are a horrible company!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>We moved from CA to TX .  We were quoted an amount to pack and mover based on the number of bedrooms  .  After packing everything they put all packed boxes on road.  Then supervisor Tomer came and quoted almost double the amount stating that we had too much of stuff to move.  At that point we were forced to agree to that amount since we were leaving the next time and all out boxes were out on the road.  It took them over a month to move everything to Texas.  The lady at the reception was very rude whenever we called for an ETA.   Our stuff came in torn boxes--many of the ceramics, glass ware were all broken..queen bed was dirty and torn.  They sent just had 2 guys to unload..who had a tough time taking furniture upstairs.  WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS CO. TO ANYONE!<//Review>< Rating>

I was really worried about moving since I had so many fragile items but thanks to USA Logistics they really took great care of me. The team that they sent to my house had already read all the special instructions I mentioned before arriving which was a good sign to know how organized this company is. I watched over them but when I realized how great they were doing in order to secure my items my stress all went away. I now know I can call USA Logistics if I want a moving company who actually cares about pleasing the customers, my move was perfect!</text>

I am so glad that my move is over, from Irvine CA to AZ during tough weather. These guys are very professional. The foreman Ben, assured me my chandelier would arrive safe. This item has been passed down through generations and it is a very emotional piece to our family. My heart was relieved when they unwrap my furniture and saw that even the baby grand piano was in perfect condition. When that chandelier came out of that crate they made for it. I immediately tipped the guys, it was my only real concern and the crew took care of me.

Usually I am ok and expecting damages in this industry but these guys honestly did a flawless job. I would recommend USA Logistics to anyone with sentimental values.< /Review>

<Text>One of the worst experience ever. Late for pick up. Charged more that double the original quote. Worst customer service ever. They where rude and condescending to say the least. They refused to allow me to speak with Steve D their agent I made all the arangements with. They never answered any of my e-mails. Manager never called me back. Promised delivery 10 to 14 days. It took them 39 days. Every time I called that gave me excuses (phone system not working, computers down, or they would just hang up on you. Their charging method when they increase your cost is different  then what Steve or their contract states. They lure you in by letting you think your inventory list and weight calculates the cost. Wrong!!! Once the come to pick up your goods that rational goes right out the window. I could go on but just writing this little bit gives me PTSD. If you hear usa logistics run run run. I am sorry this is as nice as I can be.<//Text>< Response>

Quick and easy move! Guys from Pure moving made it so simple for me from the moment I called them till the move was finished. Movers was very fast and professional, polite and respectful. All my furniture got to the place safe and they even advised me on how to arrange furniture in a new apartment! Best service! Highly recommend!<//Text>

Yes. Highly recommend. Did a great job at fair pricing. They go beyond just moving. They delivered another great job. They moved really quickly and efficiently. When we got to the location they were just as swift. They were careful with all of our things and at the end, my brother and I both realized it was definitely worth every penny. I would definitely recommend their company and would use them again in the future. I would highly recommend USA Logistics.< /review>

Very pleased with the timeliness and efficiency of my team. The price was very reasonable, they were on time and finished early. I was told I would get 2 men but 3 showed up - no additional charge. They worked fast, had tools and shrink wrap, disassembly, and reassembly at no extra charge. I would recommend and use them in the future.< /Text>

They were so quick and so careful. They were helpful every step of the way - from answering all my questions before moving day, to finding perfect parking on my crazy busy street! I couldn't have asked for a better moving experience. These guys were so fast and reasonably priced. I will definitely use them again if I move. For sure recommend.< /Review>

<Review>Thank you for making my moving experience so easy. I had the pleasure of working with USA Logistics. They moved as a unit which made everything go without a hitch. I would recommended this company to anyone looking to move short or long distance. I would also recommend using this company! They are the best!!<//Review>< user_name>

HORRIBLE! First they never called to confirm their arrival and then got mad when I called for 2 days straight with no return call.  Finally got a date of which they never (and I mean never) showed up.  Called several times a day just to finally get someone to answer the phone as they don't call you back. They lied about where the driver was or wasn't; I am convinced there never was a driver. My move was originally booked through Top Country Moving who apparently hired these "movers" to actually move me. Very unprofessional, non-responsive, and VERY rude. Don't fall for it!</Review>

Outstanding movers. I was really happy with the service I received. The movers wrapped everything up and also took apart the furniture. Then they put back the furniture at the new location. I think the price was worth it because they made it so easy for me.< /text>

I wanted to edit my post with a thank you. Our experience with USA Logistics was not ideal, but their action to refund our deposit because they were unable to meet the 2 day guaranteed window of time they stated is very professionally ethical. Thank you.

Previous Post:

Their sales team was wonderful but when I actually needed some answers, couldn’t help me. They do not seem very organized. We canceled our scheduled truck and they took our deposit because it’s within 7 days of the move that we canceled. That is understandable because it is in the contract, but the way this interaction unfolded has been super unprofessional. They should have returned our deposit because of how much they shuffled us around with ZERO communication until we reached out, multiple times, every time with a non-conclusive answer. I had to call 3 different numbers on different days to actually get someone on the phone.

We ended up renting our own truck because we had a guaranteed 2-day arrival time with USA Logistics (how does our deposit get taken if we guaranteed something and they didn’t follow through?). First we were told the move would happen on a certain day, then we were not communicated with until we called. They pushed their arrival from 6am the third day to 4pm the third day. We canceled before the afternoon appt. because we have a time frame to be out of our home and we’re wary they would nonchalantly change their arrival time AGAIN. The first day they were supposed to arrive, nobody called to confirm anything. All phone calls with their dispatch were very short, pert and unapologetic. Moving is stressful enough - nobody needs to be treated like they are wasting someone’s time, especially with the chunk of change moving costs.

I understand times are very weird right now and I’m sure running a moving company is quite stressful even without Covid in the mix. But, I have been a dispatcher, I’ve been in sales, I’ve worked to make sure customers feel the value of the service I provide. I was very disappointed in the lack of phone etiquette of their dispatchers.

I never post negative reviews. USA Logistics, I really hope you work out whatever kinks are happening internally with your company. Maybe use our $700 to get your dispatchers some appropriate training.< /Review>

<review>I need anyone who reads this review to know that any positive review left for this company is absolutely fake. If you click on the profile of the five star reviews they are all very suspicious looking- they look catfish-y and are definitely not accurate  on what this company is actually like. It is quite obvious the company is making up these good reviews to up their average rating because obviously anyone who actually has any experience with this company would give it 1 star because they are terrible (notice how the company owners only reply to the 5 star ones and refuse to acknowledge how terribly they've treated their 1 star reviewers despite them paying for their service). This company didn't even show up on the date they were supposed to come pick up our boxes, and it took them like them like four days later to actually come pick up our boxes. Now they are holding it hostage- they literally tried charging us double and its been since last friday and we have yet to recieve anything!!! Each time we ask them when the stuff will be delivered they give us a date and then when the day arrives keep pushing it back to a future date. We literally have to get an attorney involved- and who knows how long it'll actually take for our stuff to get here because it still hasn't and its been 10 days now. These are SCAMMERS with absolutely no shame. If they genuinely cared, they would bother to reply to the 1 star reviews and own up to their actions but they'll turn a blind eye and continue only replying to the 5 star reviews.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

DO NOT USE this Company.  Completely horrible experience.  Would rate them a zero if possible.  Moved from CA to FL and the company lost 5 items valued at over $1000. When I told the driver that the items on the inventory were missing, he said no, they are there.  He counted the items and when he realized they were not there, he was completely rude and said I hid them.  After I refused to sign the paperwork inventory, he signed on my behalf for the contracted inventory (which completely illegal).  HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. BEWARE. BEWARE. BEWARE.</Text>

BEWARE!! Scheduled them to handle my move on a Saturday. They confirmed the time and then less than 5 minutes later canceled and said the only time they could come was Sunday or Monday. I could not meet them Sunday so scheduled Monday. They told me between 4-5 PM. I called numerous times to confirm the time and they said they would be there at 4 since I’m catching a flight and I’m being inconvenienced. They did not show up at at all on Monday. They finally called me back and said they wouldn’t be there until 7:30. My storage place closes at 7 so obviously problematic.
Their suggestion was for me to leave the key under a mat at my storage unit and they would come get it. What the heck kind of service is that?!?! On top of the fact that they are extremely unprofessional over the phone they failed to actually pick up my stuff!< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>They not only failed the delivery dates, they mis-handled many items, where their actual movers stated they damaged them, then when we filed a claim, they denied everything.   $12000 move, over 11000 pounds, $1900 in damages, and they paid us $117 for a claim. We disputed it, went to arbitration with AAMO in WV, and AAMO in WV must be a front for the movers association, as they just sided with them for the $117.   ONLY used a reputable mover, pay a little more, and ALWAYS pay for FULL INSURANCE.   Never SIGN FOR ANYTHING when delivered, until EVERYTHING IS OPENED and damages agreed on and signed for ON THE SPOT..   REGARDLESS of the driver saying they are in a hurry for another delivery.  Moved in Nov 2019

UPDATE 12/2020    went to an arbitrator about a claim, arb found in our favor 6 months ago.  this business still hasnt paid the claim which they agreed to arbitration.   i have faxed, called, emailed, and postal mailed 2 weeks ago, postal mail came back undeliverable, with NO forwarding.   this business is corrupt and illegitimate.< /Text>< pics>

RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FORM THIS COMPANY! Anyone who gives this company more than one star is obviously working for the company or paid off. USA Logistics is a complete scam! They are a classic bait and switch. We hired them because "Paul Smith" was a disgustingly good sales person. Then the movers came into our home and packed everything up in a rush and before we knew it all of our things were on the truck and they were charging us $3,200 more than the agreed upon price. The driver lied about how much cubic feet of items we had (our estimate said it would be 800cubic feet, the driver "measured it at 2,000 cubic feet. I now know that the truck he was using didn't ever hold that much and we only took up half the truck!) and said if we didn't agree to their new price they would drive off with our things and charge $1,000/day for storage. The police were called, but they had no ability to do anything. A price $1,400 above our agreed upon price was finally approve (they were demanding $2,300 just to unload our things) and they drove off with our things. Surprisingly we got all of our things delivered, but a few things were broken/damaged. All in all it was the worst experience of my life. RUN!<//review>

<review>Moved from Merced, CA to Great Bend, KS in July 2018.
We gave them a 3 day window to pick up. Mon-Wed. They showed up on Friday.
They were 21 days late for delivery and tried to charge us extra.
Arrived at 1am when we were all asleep.
Boxes were damaged.
Half of our recliner was missing.
Said that we did not have a bed, so we had to go into the moving truck to point it out.
Would not move our washing machine and dryer to the basement without being paid $20 per person. There was 4 of them.
Were extremely rude upon delivery.
Phone calls went unanswered for hours.<//review>< pics>

<text>Provided me with a binding estimate, then, only after my goods were all loaded on to the truck, tried to extort me for nearly double the biding estimate.  At no time before the goods were loaded did the foreperson provide me with a higher estimate, and they never provided me with a written revised estimate, as required by law.  When I refused to pay the inflated price, they took my goods off the truck and dumped them in the street, damaging many.  Scam artists and extortionists, please use anyone else.<//text>< Response>

While their initial bid was unusually low, their higher  binding estimate after picking up the goods was still far lower than the larger moving companies (many of whom wouldn’t even take on this smaller job). The crew picking up and packing in LA were very professional and to our surprise the furniture arrived in Grand Rapids 8 days later (we’ll ahead of our expectations). While the local crew delivering to my son weren’t at the level of the pickup crew in LA, the mission of moving some bulky furniture across the country in the peak summer season (at a price that justified the move) was accomplished.< /review>

This place is a total sham. I had to pay 4 times the amount i was originally quoted because they had my stuff. They lost my stuff in transit and all my antiques and boxes were damaged. Everyone who works there is extremely rude and unhelpful and unapologetic. Do not ever use them. Let this be a warning.< /review>

TERRIBLE SERVICE!! The receptionist lady was vulgar; I can’t believe she is that rude! Most long-distance movers are shady, and this is just the worst one of all time! Save your money and buy new furniture and sell your old furniture because after they get down with your furniture, it’s going to look like a stampede ran over your furniture when they're done with it! Please trust me and never use this heinous moving company again!</review>

HUGE SCAM AVOID AT ALL COST. Initial sales person will quote you on something 50% of what they’re really going to charge you. They make it a reasonable estimate to ensure you take the bait and put down the deposit. That fee goes to their sales team. Once that happens, they don’t care about what happens next, they got theirs. Now the next step is “dispatch” and their movers (guys picking up) are going to come and start putting your stuff in the truck, about halfway they say you’ve reached your cubic feet estimate and now it’s going to cost you 4 dollars and some change more for each cubic feet more. They won’t let you back out (going to cost you a termination fee to offload), so then you end up having to pay a bigger deposit to them 60% of the total cost. Then it gets dropped off at a warehouse for a semi truck to come pick it up (not the uhauls they use to load your stuff up *important fact). It may take a week or more just for the delivering group to come back with their semi and pickup all the furniture from their storage facility and make the trip. Now the delivering driver will call you and tell you they can’t fit their Semi Truck into your neighborhood (because what neighborhood would fit an 18 wheeler?) bam, another 450 bucks or even more depending on cubic feet to move back into a uhaul to deliver to your doorstep. Oh flight of stairs? Yeh that’s gonna cost you. Also assembly of furniture they promised? Nope. Gonna cost you. Finally you get your stuff, in my case I caught the details of my broken flat screen worth 700 dollars. They say you have to file a claim with anthem claims, they get their money no matter what. So then you call the insurance company and find out they do it by weight times $ 0.60 a pound. Viola, a 30 dollar payment for your 700 dollar tv they broke! We’re taking these guys to small claims and hopefully recover anything just as a sentiment of justice for what they put us through. Do not be enticed by the price, do business with a credible company. BE WARNED!!!!<//review>

<Review>So it's the mourning of our move and I am a wreck. David the forman and his crew showed up. I was moving my mother in law from Arizona to California. My mother in law can be difficult but David and his crew were awesome. I was really impressed with how they actually handled my stuff. They were quick and reliable. David actually took the time to answer all my question thourghly.  I am very pleased with my movers and will refer my friends and family to this company for furture moves. Thanks you guys for your help.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1593038978736, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback!'}</Response>< gmapID>

Updated them and advised we had approximately 240 cubic feet. They picked up our items, loaded up the truck and drove off then told us we had 400 cubic feet they needed to bill at a higher cost. When the deliver arrived I measured the space in the truck which my items occupied and i only had 198 cubic feet of space. When I tried to discuss with management office she to paraphrase called me a liar and a child and told me to grow up. This move was supposed to be a great opportunity for my family, this company made our move incredibly stressful. We also had damaged items, which are the least of my concerns considering I was over charged nearly $2,000.<//text>< Response>

They charged me double when they put the stuff on the truck and would only accept cash. This was a complete scam and when they delivered my items it was completely and utterly destroyed. This is the first and last time I'll ever use this company. I'll be taking them to court shortly!< /text>

<resp>None</resp><Review>If I could give this company a negative review, I would. Scammers from the beginning to the end of our cross country move.

1. The price was double our estimate - and I wasn’t advised of the change until they came in, packed all of our stuff up and had it put in the middle of the road behind the truck.

2. We were advised that our stuff would get to us in 10-14 business days. This was on August 9th, 2019. We just received everything today, September 11th, 2019.

3. Every time we called for a status check on our stuff we were told next Monday or Tuesday....for three weeks.

4. We were advised last night that there would be an ADDITIONAL $1175 fee (on top of the already doubled estimate) to transfer our stuff from the semi it was loaded on to a smaller uhaul truck because they wouldn’t be able to get the semi down our road. Again, our belongings were held hostage and there was nothing we could do but agree to pay it.

5. Staff that answers the phone is extremely rude and uncooperative, you can tell that they deal with this several times a day by the answers that they give. They will reference the contract that was signed every time and refuse to discuss it any further. The contract itself is completely ridiculous and I’ve already been advised by my lawyer that it won’t hold up in court.

6. I have nothing complimentary to say about this moving company. We have reached out to our family lawyer and will be moving forward with suing them in attempt to recoup some of the money we were forced to pay under duress.

6. Quote/Estimate was $3500, final cost was $8500. Please be advised that I am aware that an estimate is just that, an estimate - but this is our fourth cross-country move and we have never been charged double the estimate, or been presented the new fee under such absurd circumstances.

7. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.< /Review><user_id>106022098366220398779< /user_id>< Name>

DO NOT BOOK! They are scammers. They take advantage of people and hike up your estimate 3x. Also they are really unprofessional. It seems like they contract with random drivers/truckers so you never know who is going to  pack, move, and unpack your stuff.<//text>

<user>103191268867686069497<//user><review>(Translated by Google) The worst company to make your move. I do not recommend it. The lack of professionalism is total.
My packages had to be picked up for a move out of California and I never received an update on when it would be. I had to call them constantly to find out but still no one gave me a valid answer, I was 3 days waiting for them to make the collection and on the third day they tell me that they cannot do it because they have no availability 😡😡😡😡😡😡. Total lack of respect and without a solution to my problem.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.
Very dissatisfied at 💯.

(Original)
La peor compañía para hacer tu mudanza. No la recomiendo. La falta de profesionalismo es total.
Debían recoger mis paquetes para una mudanza fuera del estado de California y nunca recibí actualización de cuando sería. Yo tenía que llamarlos constantemente para saber pero igual nadie me daba una respuesta válida estuve 3 días esperando que hicieran la recogida y al tercer día me dicen que no pueden hacerlo porque no tienen disponibilidad 😡😡😡😡😡😡. Falta de respeto total y sin una solución a mi problema.
NO LA RECOMIENDO.
Muy insatisfecha al 💯.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Daiso is a great store in the Peace Plaza shopping center, in the Japantown neighborhood of San Francisco. It is a chain store but I have only been to this location.

You can find all sorts of great items here. Japanese candy and snacks, cosmetics and face masks, personal care items, dinnerware, chopsticks, mugs, other kitchenware, home decor items, paper hand fans, flags and kites, assorted knick-knacks... the list goes on. They have so many things, at great prices. I attached a few photos of some items I have purchased here. Make sure you also see the Peace Pagoda monument nearby, as it is beautiful. (Attached photo of that too.)< /Text>

Wonderful daiso, and quite large in comparison to other locations I have visited in northern California. Very clean, spacious and easy to keep 6ft away while perusing the long aisles. Store was very neat and tidy, cleaning witnessed in multiple areas during my visit. A lot of items that were a surprise to me on the shelf as I would have needed to travel to 2 or even 3 different daiso locations to find all the items. Stationery and crafts were large full aisles and a lot of options presented (what I normally check out). Staff was quick to help me find items and checkout was very efficient. Definitely visit any time I am in the downtown area.< /review>

This place rocks! It's worth going to this one as opposed to the smaller one on 16th St Plaza. Great place to buy coin batteries - great selection. Just be aware that you can't return anything. Most things are $1.50 - and if you see a price in yen that's greater than 100 yen, then it will cost more than $1.50 - they have charts all over the store for the dollar price for the yen price.</review>

Best place to shop for those of us who live in small spaces. Smart, cute, functional items to get your apartment/room organized, clean, comfortable, etc. Plus personal items, gifts, treats, beauty, hygiene, totes. Almost everything you could imagine. All made to fit in small spaces.</Text>

<Review>Shopping at Daiso is fun.
You can purchase a whole bag of goodies and still have some money left.  Then too, the quality of Daiso's dollar store goods is really much higher than that of the other dollar stores.  Just figure when you go to Daiso you're going to be there awhile.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

COVID-19 review: The last time for entry is 6:40pm even though the business closes at 7pm so be mindful. There is a line outside now and closed off the previous main entrance inside. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and there wasnt too much of a line. They do let very few people in though, lot less than other stores so the wait may be a little long. There was lots of room to socially distance so I felt very comfortable shopping. This Daiso was a lot better years ago with a lot more inventory. They've downsized for a while now but I guess that's business. Items also got more expensive. They do have a lot of really useful household items for cheap -- things you didnt know you wanted. Of course, don't come here for quality items but if you want quick fixes this is the place to go.

Pre-COVID: The place was always overly crowded and stuffy. You smell people's breath in the stuffiness. A bit stingy on the A/C? Sometimes the line would get so long you have to wait a good 30-40minutes. Totally not worth.< /text>

<review>It’s a really wonderful Japanese store with so many cute and tasty things to try. It allows you to have an idea of how the Japanese culture is like in a very modern fashion. You’ll be able to find everything, from sweets to socks to sake cuts to Rilakkuma plushies. Love coming to this store whenever I’m at SF</review>< username>

Well stocked, well organized, quick checkout even when the line is long as was my experience Sunday evening. So many cute things in this "dollar" store (almost everything is $1.50 unless marked otherwise)<//Text>

Good variety, clean, not too crazy busy during morning hours. Parking dicey. Japantown mall is weird, lots of empty stores, but worth a trip to visit Daiso. Everything is $1.50 unless marked! They carry everything from housewares, candy, snacks, bento boxes, hot pads, drawing pads, bowls... I mean the selection, it's endless really. Parking is challenging.< /Text>

<Review>My friends and I went to Hong Kong and tried these chips. We really liked them but then forgot to pack some for the trip back. It was cool to see them here and now we can munch on these all we want. I also always walk in to Daiso and leave with q bunch of cool stuff that makes life easier.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg5zPGg3-GznriMvx_MkZBZU2FQXwkRa0sB8CA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Best and largest Daiso in the area. You can find everything you need and things you didn’t imagine exist with unbeatable price of $1.5 there! Going there is like a happy discovery trip. Love it!< /review>

I love bargains and Daiso is full of them to my delight. There are aisles and aisles of colorful and cute items from Japan that you never knew you had to have. I came to browse and came home loaded with gadgets that are so clever such as the egg timer that you drop in to monitor when your eggs are perfectly boiled and unique wrapping paper with blue stripes at about a third of the prices you would pay in stationary stores. Everything is only $1.50 unless marked higher and worth every penny.<//text>

I'm in love with Daiso. Every time I go I find myself wandering through every aisle to see what they have new. Most products are $1.50 unless marked otherwise. I've stocked up on sushi-making supplies, tried different Japanese food and drinks, and gotten some handy little gadgets to make life easier. I would highly recommend.< /Review>

Easy to see right off of Peace Plaza servicing San Francisco and the adjoining areas.   Clean facilities.   Public Restrooms.   Reasonably priced.   Credit cards accepted.   Many aisles filled with Japanese products.   Nice staff.   We will definitely be going back.</Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Think of your local $1 store.  Daiso is the $1.50 store Japanese store with some real quality items with something for just about everyone.  Unless noted, all items are $1.50.  I've never seen an item for more than $3.00 in there.

Items I look for whenever I visit Daiso: Travel accessories, travel wipes, house slippers, pens, stationary, notebooks, cards, organizing containers, Japanese snacks and soft drinks.   They have $1.50 Japanese items for every room in the house. The products they offer are exclusive to Daiso stores only which enhances the visit.  It's easy to get carried away in here because the items are so cheap but after years of visits I've narrowed downs my list. hehe  Like the $1 stores, products come and go so timing is everything in regards to finding things I'm looking for.  Overall, I've never walked out of there with a light bag.

Located in Japan town, this Daiso store always enhances my visit there.
The value I've encountered through the years shopping as been fantastic.  Whenever I anticipate a Daiso visit, I'll pack a larger luggage just in case I go to town in there.  Swing by and browse around if you have to be in the area.  Good Luck!</text>< username>

<Text>There is a large variety of products to choose from, most at the great price of $1.50. There is an immense selection of Japanese/Asian snacks, and lots of fun trinkets can be bought here! One issue I found with the place was the lack of employees. I found no workers around the store (besides the cashier area)on a crowded Saturday.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

Lots of aisles. Plenty of cute items. A lot of the things are intelligently designed so everytime I visit I see little things I could use which would make my home better. Another great feature of this store was the size of the aisles. They were spacious. I didn't feel crammed. I had enough room to move around and feel comfortable around all the other shoppers so I took my time browsing.< /Text>

Japanese version of a dollar store (most items are $1.50) with a lot of fun and interesting items. It's a suitable place to shop for inexpensive necessities of decent quality, but also a fun place to find unique that's-a-cool-idea products that you won't find anywhere else.</text>

<Review>Scoops to nuts as they say.  Big selection of gifts under a couple dollars.  Even if you don't need to buy anything go in anyway< /Review><username>Allen Oertel<//username>< Rating>

<text>Loved it.  This store isn't a true dollar store because most things start at $1.50. But they have things that I had never seen.  I didn't get to through the whole store due to time limits but they have  selection of home goods. School/office supplies.  Electronics, makeup, storage goods.  I have baked in a few dishes and they were very good.  The ceramic knife I bought is better then some of my other knives.  If in Japan Town in San Fransisco you will need to bring your own shopping bag or buy one of there's.< /text><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

It's a dollar store but a lot better! My only advice is be warey about some select things costing a little more, or like the drinks are almost always at least $2 ish ish. It's easy to go wild.
I've gotten pencil pouches and trinkets here as gifts to friends, and they've lasted for years! One writer friend kept the pencil pouch I gave her in 9th grade, all the way till 2nd year of college, when she decided to just have one pencil/pen combo thing at all times instead. She still has it, a year after graduation :)< /text>

<review>Lots of household goods, beauty items,  stationary/school supplies, food, some arts and crafts, electronics,  and a bit of clothing, gardening, and auto accessories.  For mostly a 1.50, quality is quite good. Always crowded but not horribly so. The no-nonsense cashiers keep the lines moving almost too fast to gawk at last minute items!<//review>< time>

There's usually a line, but it moves quickly.

There's more variety of stuff. The majority of stuff is still $1.50...But there's also a good selection that's more. Not all of it is great quality, but like all dollar stores, you get more for your money.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Good luck with parking around here. I tend to get confused in which part of the "mall" it's in, especially if you park in the garage. It's cramped with a ton of people in it. Kitchen stuff is kinda disappointing. Most things are $1.50 so hey, it's worth going if you're looking for a cheap, quirky gift.<//text><Date>1551752558364</Date><userid>117350050038135036032<//userid>< user_name>

<text>So many things for $1.50!  Lots of cute school supplies, food erasers (erasers in the shape of food), kitchen stuff, flip flops ... This is the biggest Daiso in the area (someone please let me know if I'm wrong about this). As part of the Japan town mall, it's surrounded by lots of other shops and restaurants.< /text>< pictures>

I love this place. It’s better than a 99cents store. When I first discovered this place, I went overboard on purchasing 80s retro electronic fun colored watches (which I ended up giving to many co-workers and friends as gifts). You can find just about anything in the craft department. Another lucky score was bread/cake pans that were made in Italy.< /Text>

It's like the Japanese version of Dollar Tree only better. Everything is $1.50. Selected items cost more but the price is on the item of it does. Make time to stop and shop if you've never been to one of these stores before. You won't be disappointed!< /Review>

Daiso is very popular a Japan-based chain of discount stores (though I'm sure almost all products are made in China). Most products in the store are $1.50 (probably 100 yen in Japan). Quality is better than you might expect for the price. Some stores are bigger than others with better selections. The Japantown store is average in size. The downtown store (Market Street) is much smaller. Some of the suburban stores are larger.< /review>

This is one of the smaller Daiso locations in the Bay Area. It’s got the typical cheap Japanese products like desk toys, snacks, and basic items. Great for dorm shopping or apartment essentials on a budget.</text>

Small item shop that is very popular in Japan. I always try to stop by if I am near one and see If they have any small items I may need. Hint it is a very good place to get school supplies. Pencils, pens, erasers, small things like this.< /text>

<date>1362866113116<//date><review>You can find absolutely everything at Daiso. The quality of most of the items is average, but definitely worth it for the $1.50 price tag. The food and drinks section is probably my favorite. You can find a lot of items from bento boxes to stationary. Everything is just so cute! I always leave the store with things I will probably never use, but everything is simply too adorable to pass up.<//review>< gmapID>

Good place to get affordable gift wrap needs, especially for large sized gift bags. Best value for me comes from their wide selection of stainless steel trays to organize my kitchen cooking essentials. Warning: can become a major time sink.

Minus one star because it can be hard to see all products. Plus, when a lot of stock gets crammed into displays, some of the items get damaged and one needs to pick out the least damaged product.<//text>

They sell some stationary and paper goods that are a STEAL at $1.50 as well as LOTS of miscellany to wander through.</review>< UserId.>

Who knew you could spend so much at a place where everything is $1.50 (unless otherwise marked)? Want some Japanese snacks? Amazing stationary? Cups, bowls and plates? A whiteboard and dry erase markers? A hat? Some cosmetics? You get the picture. They have everything. And nothing looks like it cost $1.50. The checkout line looks long, but it moves quite quickly.< /text>

My first time checking out this store.  It is probably better than 3 stars if I spent more time perusing.  All kinds of knick-knacks.  Lots of little Japanese imported items that i don't want to overreact to positively or negatively just cause they are new to me brand wise.</Review>

Daiso has so many little things that you'd actually want vs something like a 99 cent store which is all trash. This is your typical busy Diaso with many random but useful items at very cheap prices. Definitely worth a visit< /Review>

Upscale $1 store I shopped here 5 years before and don't remember keeping much stuff.  It is good to get the necessities like scissors, bungee ropes, stationary, bowls and cups but nothing to really write home about.  Do visit if you are in town and you forgot to pack toothpaste, lots of interesting Japanese import stuff, disorganized, and not as good as the first time I visited.  Maybe my needs changed though.</review>

Unlike most dollar stores, Daiso has items you could actually use. I tend to get my tea supplies here. Plus, they always have a great selection of wooden spoons. Did I mention that just about everything is $1.50? I mean how could you go wrong?<//Text>

One of the larger Daiso in San Francisco. Compared to the Daiso at the Serramonte shopping center, this has just as much merchandise and selection despite being smaller. Wide selection of ceramics and Asian amenities that don't just come and go. I bought a good quality calligraphy stone a few years ago and they continue to carry it. From school supplies to basic hardware tools. Hardware tools are very low quality so don't expect much unless you're in a pinch.< /Text>

Well, it's more a dollar-and-a-half store than a dollar store. The headphones and ear buds, for instance, are MUCH better than what you get in the dollar store. Good for nylon wallets and esoteric kitchen gadgets, too. The Market Street location is very uplifting when the Financial District gets on your nerves and you need some Meiji Chocorooms RIGHT NOW.< /text>

Used to live in Japan and between this and Series we were spoiled. Great to be able to visit one when outside Japan and stock up on all sorts of things, in particular the surprisingly awesome variety of home wares such as plates and glassware. Picked up a lot of things for taking home to the new house. Wish there were more.<//Text>

<review>Love this store. This is the biggest and best Daiso in the SF Bay Area. Can easily spend an hour just wandering up and down the aisle looking at all the stuff. There is something for everyone and you can easily find something (most things are $1.50) for your home, personal care and accessories, Japanese snacks, tons of kawaii stationery, office supplies, cleaning supplies, cooking, smartphone and tablet accessories, etc. Be warn: Weekends are crazy busy. The line to pay can be long. Only negative: There is a "no refund" policy.< /review><name>Karen V Chin< /name>< Time>

I love Daiso!  I stopped in the Berkeley location a couple years ago and have made efforts to stop whenever I see one.  There's a Daiso in a mall in Sacramento as well.  There are tons of random things that are fun to look at (and sometimes buy).  Chair socks?  Yes, I will.  I really like their "B6 Leather Type Notebooks" which remind me of Moleskine, but are something like $2.< /review>

Always out of stock of items, their inventory is not big so cannot expect to always have the items you want. Staffs are never helpful here, they love the phrase "We have whatever is out on the shelf." It feels like this is a written script for them to say.< /text>

<Review>Every time I go to Daiso, I have to set a limit of $20.  Otherwise, I'd go buck-wild crazy and buy too much for no reason.  Giving away my $20 for frivolous thrills is easy to do too.

Nick knack galore!</Review>< pictures>

I could spend 50 bucks here. It's always busy but the items they have could be knick knacks or stuff for the house from kitchen to the bathroom etc. If u need stationary stuff this is the place for cute stuff.<//text>

Things are cheap here, love it! Not all of them are of high quality, so be aware, buy only the stuff you think are durable.< /text>

Great place to go and experience 100 yen shop. A lot of products from Japan at 1.50 and few items will be a little more.</Text>

The items you'll find here hold up pretty well for something priced at $1.50, and you'll almost always find something you needed or wanted. I've found things here for $1.50 that were priced at $15 elsewhere in San Francisco! It's easy to go overboard and overfill your cart, but before you put yourself at risk of buyer's remorse, remember that there is a no-returns policy.</Text>< time>

Was in the back near the sandals once though and this little girl who was maybe 10 asked an employee very politely and very clearly what the smallest sandal size they carry is. The employee acted really annoyed, asked the girl to repeat herself twice, and then just yelled at her that they had nothing for her. I was like whoa. No idea what that was about. Felt bad for the little girl.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The Japanese equivalent of a dollar store, with almost everything under $5. What makes this one different than most of the other locations, is that have they have a very large selection of dish wares, which are cheap, well made, and often very beautiful.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None<//pics><Text>I usually get dragged in here, but I have to say I do like all the little bags and cases that can be used for my gadgets, phones, tablets, laptops, etc. I bought about 30 mesh zippered thingies to organize all my assorted wires and cables in my cabinet of tech supplies. They have padded sleeves that perfectly fit a Macbook Pro 13" and smaller padded cases that hold mobile phones like a glove.

Best of all, this stuff is about 1/10th the price of what you'd pay at somewhere like the Container Store. So stock up and happy organizing.< /Text>< GmapID>

Good place to poke around and look for things you need, or more often, things you want and impulse buy sort of things. Everything is $1.50 unless otherwise noted and you can big range of products.</text>

It's not bad for $1.50 store, they have tupperware, kitchen supplies, claypots (big and small), food, etc. The rule is pretty simple too: everything is $1.50 unless a price is listed.  So if no price tag, then it's $1.50.  I had to buy an iphone cord since mine was breaking.  bought one here for $1.50 and it works great like any other cord would.</Review>

<review>My ABSOLUTE favorite Japanese dollar store. This place has everythingggggggg! and 85% of the products are priced at $1.50 - WHAAAAT! I was only in San Francisco visiting for 3 days and felt compelled to visit this store TWICE just so I felt like I saw everything lol #Obsessed

What I got:
- Tweezers: these felt really sturdy and well worth the price
- Compression socks: picked these up for my mom who has spider veins
- Ceramic Baby Chick sugar jar: so cute!
- Hi-Chew Mango candy
- Lotte Maccha Koala Cookies
- Silicone Frog pot handle holder
- Solar powered dancing panda
- Traditional Japanese money wedding card/envelope
- Apple Mango gummies
- Lychee Calpico

What I considered but didn't get:
- Wig: They had a brown wavy wig for $6 that I was SERIOUSLY wondering if I should get but then decided against it because I wasn't sure how it would look on me
- Cat key chains - these were cute but you could tell were poorly made< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I love Daiso. Pleasantly surprised to find this one in J-Town. Considering its location, I thought it was pretty large! Although not as large as my favorite location in Union City.

Great spot to pick up stocking stuffers or just things you didn't know you needed. Everything for the most part costs $1.50. Last trip I scored:

* Calpico drink - Called "Calpis" in Japan, my daughter refused to drink it because she thought it was cow pee. But it's really a tasty milk-based drink.
* Mittens - Cute red ones with smiling bunnies.
* Notebooks - Tons and tons of 'em.
* Mini plastic containers - Made in Japan (unlike a lot of the stuff here made in China for Daiso), these are so handy for lunches, thumbtacks, vitamins, whatever.
* Office supplies - staplers, paper clips, pens, etc.
* Cute tape - In skinny or wider versions, this is printed colorful tape that is great for wrapping gifts or just being funny. Last one I got said, "Celabrate the day of you birth."

I dare you to come in here and walk away empty handed.< /review><Response>None<//Response></record>

I feel like there's always something I can buy for $1.50 here that I could use whether it's a notebook, a shower cap or a Santa Claus costume ($5). A few things are more than $1.50 but that's ok--it's still insanely cheap.  They have a good selection of wrapping paper and gift wrapping ideas at this location.  I like looking at all the cute bakeware and bento lunch making ware they have here.  Service was great this time I went because, I had a lot of coins I wanted to get rid of.  She said I could go ahead and throw all the coins on the table.  She calculated it all and lightened my coin purse. Domo agigato girl at Daiso!</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A lot of things useful (and some not so much, but pretty) good quality and very cheap. It is to be a long time looking at everything, but spending little. Almost everything is $ 1.50 and what is not that has marked another price, but does not increase much more.

(Original)
Un montón de cosas útiles (y algunas no tanto, pero lindas) de buena calidad y muy baratas. Es para estar mucho tiempo mirando todo, pero gastando poco. Casi todo está $1.50 y lo que no está eso tiene marcado otro precio, pero no aumenta mucho más.<//Review></record>

(Translated by Google) The clerk's attitude is too bad. The person who seems to be a manager was also a very rude Japanese person. It's pathetic.

(Translated by Google) I think Daisoragi is based on one dollar and went into it, but most starts at $ 1.55, right? The display method was empty and it was less fun, so it came out more than half
