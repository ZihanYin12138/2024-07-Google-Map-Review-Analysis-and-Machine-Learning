<Review>I would give them 6 stars if I could 😍 This place is the definition of a hidden gem. Super local vibe in a no frills, low-key location. From the outside you wouldn't expect much but this food is packed with flavor!!! I wouldn't be surprised if this place gets a nod in the next Michelin Watch List. I drove over 50 minutes to try this place for Dine LA and let me tell you it was worth it and I will be back. Support this local business they deserve it. If you haven't had Filipino before this is an amazing place to try all of those unique flavors. Great for family style meals with big parties as well. They also have heaters outside for when it gets cold. Both the Chef (JR) and Server were super friendly and made us feel at home. The also do pickup if you want to grab a family style meal for the family and will bring the food out to your car. The prices are also phenomenal for the quality of the food. We had a feast and only spent $50 for 2 people.

Edit: Went here again and they even remembered us and where we were from. The food was amazing again, we will definitely be coming back. They have a great Chef here. Unfortunately cannot upgrade my review to the 6 stars that they deserve. My only wish is that they offer fountain drinks so I don't have to buy every refill.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I ordered 4 items, the total bill ended up being $86 that's one appetizer 2 entrees and a dessert. The food was okay, I expected better for the hype that this place receives. The service was good I just didn't feel like the price was justified by what I received the beefsteak with crispy fried potatoes on top was 3 out of 10.</review>< pics>

We drove from Malibu just to try this place. They have Delicious food and great service :) we had beef ribs in banana bbq sauce, beef brisket bis tek, Mary’s chicken si sig, and small garlic rice! All of this was more than enough for two people as they serve their meals in a “family style” sort of way (we had lots of left overs). We also tried the halo halo desert. It had Ube Ice cream, which we had never tried before and loved! We ate outdoors and they made sure to sit us by the fire and placed a heating lamp right by us to ensure that we were comfortable. We placed our order ahead of time as they do make orders as they come and we were very hungry so we got to eat as soon as we sat down. They were also very accommodating in changing the time of our reservation. We will be back!< /text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>I have a bad experience as first timer in going to Tatang. This Filipino restaurant was recommended by our close friend that they have good foods. One of my orders was fish fillet.  When the guy handed me the receipt to sign, I didn't review the detail trusting everything was in order. When I arrived home all my order were there but when I reviewed the receipt, I was charged Longanisa MB (Pork and Shrimp) = $19.00 which was expensive than fish I ordered. When it was an honest mistake, the foods I received should be Longanisa MB (Pork & Shrimp).
For me this is a plane dishonesty. I am not recommending this restaurant to my relatives and friends.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Fancy Philipino food from a great family and chef.  My recommendations: chicken sig sig, tomato duck egg salad, pork ribs with banana bbq sauce, and of course the ube bread pudding.< /Text>

Tatang restaurant was the first Filipino restaurant I've been to. The only other time I've had Filipino food was when I was at my friend's house. This restaurant definitely left a great impression on me. It's Filipino food with a little more of a modern twist to it, but everything was tasty and of high quality. I had the privilege of having the kamayan feast, which is an assortment of food laid out on banana leaves, which is best eaten with a large group around the table. We had the chicken sisig, the beef brisket, the garlic rice, liempo, crispy pa-ta, and sakahan veggies. I especially loved the crispy pata. The skin was so crispy, and the inside was juicy and tender. The garlic rice was also pretty amazing. I have to note that the fruits they included in this meal was also very sweet, from the watermelon to the pinneaples.

I would highly recommend Tatang if you are in North Hollywood. Especially if you want to try the kamayan experience, this is the place to do it. This is hard to find in LA, so definitely take advantage of this experience. The parking here is plentiful, which is a plus. I shot a Youtube video of my experience here, which you can find on my Youtube channel, Rockstar Eater.</Text>

< Review>
Tatang is incredibly WONDERFUL. Their flavors are authentic. Their staff are the loveliest people. They are not afraid to experiment with new flavor profiles. I highly recommend to anyone looking to try Filipino food for the first time or to anyone missing home & wants the REAL THING! They have been experimenting with new offerings with their sister brand BillieAnn... YOU MUST try the baby bibingkas and cassava cakes. For Tatang I recommend: palabok, crispy pata, garlic rice is a MUST, you really can’t go wrong with any of em. Thank you for being a true example of an exceptional small business- quality wise, service wise. Can’t wait to order more and more<//Review>

A very underrated restaurant. As a natural born Filipino myself, the cuisine served here was quite exceptional, and it stays true to the  spirit of true Filipino food. Some options are even in Ilocano language, implying that the owner of the restaurant has vast knowledge about Filipino culture, especially in food for this case.</Text>

The taste of beef mami & lumpia didn't meet my expectations for their prices... You can imagine how the soup taste after adding water & didn't give a good boil... That's what I'm getting right now.</review>

My wife and I both grew up in the Philippines so it was a treat to eat Filipino food anytime we visit California. During our honeymoon trip in August after getting married in San Francisco, we called Tatang ahead to check if they served Sinigang and went to have some. Upon arrival, the restaurant asthetics looked humble but clean. The place was understandably warm during that day and they had industrial fans to cool people down in the absence of airconditioning units. The server’s name was Chiho. She was our favorite part of the experience as she was very helpful and welcoming. We ordered the Bistek, Sinigang and Tocino. The Tocino and Bistek tasted great out of the kitchen but the Sinigang was not tart enough to what we are used to eating. Also the pork meat was darker than you would usually think but we decided it was okay to eat. After informing Chiho about the soup tartness, she explained that they only use real ingredients and not the instant packet. Afterwards she came back and offered to make additional soup using more tamarind. The additional soup came out tasting more like the authentic Sinigang so we ended up as really happy customers. Servings were more than enough and definitely for sharing. We took some left Great job Tatang.< /Text>

Love this place. Been coming here regularly since its opening week and haven't been disappointed. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The chicken sisig and garlic rice are crave-worthy. Sidenote: they get very busy sometimes, but it's worth the wait.</Review>

<text>The food was great. My friends and I got mostly everything to go. We ordered the chicken lumpia, ube fries, paancit, chicken adobo, beef brisket bistek, chicken sisig, garlic rice, turohn, and the bread pudding. Everything was pretty delicious! I could have passed on the bread pudding but it wasnt bad, maybe we needed to have that fresh in the restaurant instead of at home. My favorite things were the chicken adobo, garlic rice, and ube fries. I am no Filipino food expert, but my Filipino friend said it's pretty legit/authentic. The service was a bit slow for my taste (waited about an hour for everything to be prepared), but I understand they made a ton of food for us.</text>< Rating>

<time>1576083247226< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My family didn't really want to cook for Thanksgiving this year so we went with Tatang's holiday catering package. Everything was so good! Highly recommend.
The pan de sal panko crusted turkey was surprisingly not dry even after reheating for a little bit in the oven. The ube swirled mashed potatoes were amazing. Package also came with pa la book turkey gravy, mango + cranberry chutney, calamansi brown buttered seeh tao and honey patis glazed organic carrots. My favorite from the entire package was the bibinka + longanisa stuffing.
For dessert: Pan de sal bread pudding was a little too sweet for me. But everyone else in the family loved it.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1576090110077, 'text': 'THANK YOU SO MUCH ❤️. Hope to see you guys soon 😊.'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Very disappointed with this place. We visited because it's close to universal studios and we saw rating is high. We're  group of families from Nevada and Illinois so we're not very familiar with the good Filipino place to dine. I should gave thumbs up for the owner and staffs for great accommodations but thumbs down for their foods.we order alot from their menu but nothing really taste right. We ended up cooking in our suites because we throw all our to go food from the restaurant. Just for example the halo halo, where the heck they learned that pinoy halo halo comes with BlackBerry or any berries?so disappointing because prices are way too high also<//Review>

Exquisite Phillipino/California food, true to Phillipino taste. Enjoyed sharing dishes. Loved that JR, the owner/chef came to the table to tell us about the menu and check on how we liked our dishes. Service was excellent. This small restaurant is a welcome addition to my regular visit list. Make reservations and order ahead when possible.</text>

We saw this place listed in a foodie guide to NoHo, and had a great dinner. Filipino food is popular in LA now and with good reason. The chef JR Martin came to our table to welcome us and help us order. We had lumpia to start, a good salad made with summer tomatoes, garlic rice, sisig made with free range chicken. All delicious, with Filipino flavors and a modern touch.<//Text>

I Yelped this place and decided to give it a try. Needless to say I was not disappointed. The food was AWESOME! The owner/Chef "JR" was more than accommodating as was his friendly staff. We ordered the pansit, chicken sisig, and pork liempo. As a hybrid Filipino, I have been familiar with Filipino cusine most of my life. The food was similar to traditional Filipino food yet slightly different. I say that in a good way. The flavors brought to each dish was simply AMAZING. I highly recommend you give Tatang a try and experience something unique.< /review>

<review>Went here with my family because we were in the NoHo area from Palmdale today. Friendly and big smiles from the workers here as soon as we walked in! Our waitress was attentive to us & memorized our orders perfectly. Food was delicious and fair proportions for the prices. The Chicken Sisig was my favorite!
Be prepared to wait as food is made to order and reservations with a pre-order is recommended.
Maraming salamat,Tatang :)< /review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>What a great surprise to eat here tonight.  I love trying different Filipino restaurants and learning more about the food and culture.

Chef JR and his wife are running a stupendous new 20 seat restaurant. Intimate setting where you can see the stoves and grill, along with the plating. It's great to see and feel the energy. You can tell the other patrons feel it too.

After a little discussion with the chef and one of the waitresses, we decided on the salad Camateese salad which was standout and not to be missed. We got some lumpia, Petaluma chicken sisig, meatballs, a small plate of garlic rice (trust me it ain't small), and the pork belly adobo.

The pork reminded me of a delicious beef stew w a simple gravy and fried vegetable strings as a base...

The sisig w/ its acid note, organic egg, and mixed with garlic rice was comfort food at its finest.

Honestly, we left no room for dessert, took some leftovers home, and can't wait to go back w friends and try the few things we didn't have like Ube fries, chicken adobo, bistec, and soups.  And I gotta have that salad again.<//review>< Pics>

Really neat skate park. My son loves coming here and riding his skateboard and scoot. Lots of kids there and it’s tucked away in the hills. It’s also nice if you wanna go for a small hike. Next the the skate park is trails that lead to the top of the hill. Really good views of the bay.</review>

This is a great park for the kids! Mine have both skate boards and scooters, but currently trick scooters are all the rage. They love it. Not sure why others seem to dislike the presence of scooters so much...? I think it’s more newbie/less skilled riders that bother some of the older/more accomplished kids. That’s too bad! I wish parents would teach their kids to be more patient and accommodating of others, instead of grumbling alongside them!  Ignore the mean looks/heavy sighs and grumblers! Still highly recommend.< /text>

Most excellent skate park. Too many skooter kids with bad manners. But don't let that stop you. Just start throwing skooters if they get in your way . Eventually they figure it out.  My favorite skate park.< /text>

it's ok and tons off kids on scooters that are mostly in your way. design is kind off weird there is no space for people who like to do tricks off stairs and it rolls downhill so that's another thing that bugs me. no flat rails. steep parts etc plus you get kicked out for not wearing a helmet most off the time that's very annoying because I don't wear helmets or whatever never needed one and never will.< /text>

"No Bikes Allowed".  Kind of weak if you ask me.  I get it, bikes go faster and could be dangerous to people on skateboards and scooters, but why exclude them totally?  Plenty of kids and adults like to ride bikes in parks like this.  They could easily have divided up days of the week for bikes / skateboards and scooters.  Like for example they could have said bikes only on Tuesday/Thursday, etc.

It would also be useful to have times that newbies and little kids can ride safely with no experienced riders blasting through the park, as well as the opposite - times when experienced,highly skilled riders can ride with no interference.

For such a nice park, it seems poorly managed in a way that doesn't give any particular group of riders an ideal option, and excludes a whole category of people who want to ride bikes.<//Text>

Lots of interesting lines and unusual features, with a beautiful view too! Helmet required, I got busted arriving around 8am when it opened but was lent a helmet by a friendly parks employee, looked to be the only one they have. Other people showed up shortly after without helmets and stayed for hours without trouble.</Review>

If you scooter and you are 4-5 years old or have the maturity age of a 4-5 year old this is your paradise. Don’t go if you skate it’s a waste of time.< /Text>

this skatepark is absolutely amazing if you are a vert or pool skater because they have an insanely amazing bowl. if you skate street don't bother going because the street and park area is filled with scooters. if it weren't for these scooters the park would be one of my favorites following lake Cunningham because there are skatepark types for everyone. i am a vert and pool skater and really appreciate the bowl and big park section! this skate park is really worth your time. if you can go very early or during the week you will have an amazing time in one of the best skateparks in the country if it weren't for scooters which you won;t have to deal with< /Review>

For whatever reason children on scooters are allowed, but bmx bicycles are not because "this is a skatepark"....hmmmm.....

tragic waste of an often underused skatepark. It is only busy during the after school rush or weekends<//Text>

Dr Nimira is amazing! Her technique is gentle and allows your body to make changes from head to toe on its own, with little adjustment. She is so patient, kind, knowledgeable and very attentive whenever you need her between visits. I have migraines, headaches, neck pain and alignment issues. I have only been seeing her for about 6 weeks (6 month program of healing)and already feel a difference. My body is making drastic changes for the better. I recommend her to anyone searching for answers and relief that the medical field, other chiropractic options and PT cannot provide.</text>

I appreciate Dr. Nimira's attitude of personal care and concern for her patients. Her unique method of adjustment is the only one I will ever allow because of the deterioration I have in my neck. Excellent service always!</review>

I discovered Dr. Nimira online when I was researching how I could find relief from my debilitating migraines. I have been a migraine sufferer my entire adult life and have learned to manage them. Until a few years ago, when the cause changed and they seemed to be derived from hormonal issues. On my first visit, Dr. Nimira took a very thorough history and took the time to listen to me. She was very confident she could help me. Within a couple of weeks, I started to see improvement. It has now been a few months and my headaches are less frequent and not as severe. After suffering for years, I have hope that I am going to feel better. She only adjusts me when she feels it is necessary and I appreciate her practical approach.  She is always available to chat in between appointments and is so caring. I am so happy that I found her and highly recommend her.<//review>

So grateful to have found Dr. Alibhoy! She treats my daughter as well as myself for a painful ficus nerve condition!. In just a few weeks we could both tell a huge difference! She is gentle, kind and uses caution in her treatment. We are both having less pain and doing so much better since we started treatment! Thank you Nimira! We adore you!< /Review>

< Review>
Dr. Nimira is so great at what she does, especially improving women’s health. My migraines and dizziness have improved tremendously since seeing her. For migraine/vertigo sufferers or anyone who wants overall improved health, I highly recommend Dr. Nimira. She’s so friendly and personable too.</Review>

<Date>1608158919435<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My life depends on Dr. Nimira’s practice.Very often I used to have a stiff and stuck neck, when I couldn’t turn my head; and each time it took a long while for it to heal and go back to normal. Also, I never knew when that condition could come back, so it ruined quite a few plans for me in the past.

Right now, I feel safe all the time under Dr. Nimira’s care. She performers  any necessary adjustments in a timely manner, therefore no more bad surprises in my life.

I highly recommend her expertise, and I’m  about to take my husband and mom as well to her office for consultation.

Dr. Nimira deserves five stars! ⭐️< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1608160523907, 'text': "Thank you Inga -  It had been my pleasure keeping the ugly surprises out of your life!

I went to see her out of desperation , I had horrible mouth pain for 4 years that no other health professional could begin to treat.

<review>Dr. Nimira is getting me through the most stressful time of my life. Back in March,  I transitioned from working outside my home to working from home full time while also helping my two young children navigate distance learning.
This was a big change for me. These changes, along with worry over COVID and the pressure of keeping my family healthy caused me major anxiety. The anxiety and stress I experienced was exhausting. Somedays I wasn’t able to get out of bed because my neck and back pain was so bad.
I could not continue like this so I started searching for relief. I focused my search on chiropractor treatment because I wanted to find an alternative to prescription drugs.  I also wanted to resolve my issues not mask them. Thankfully I found many positive recommendations and reviews for Dr. Nimira on Facebook.
I started treatment in July and for once in my life my anxiety and stress is manageable. I’ve expressed to Dr. Nimira many times now how it is just unbelievable to feel depression free without medication. I didn’t think it was possible. The adjustments are working for me and I am feeling really good.
Dr. Nimira is great. She listens and cares, she’s kind and patient.  I am so grateful she is helping me through this crazy time.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1607538272393, 'text': "Melissa, thank you so much for sharing. I hope others that read this get some hope that it is possible to pull yourself out of the darkness of anxiety and depression. While I always know that bringing stability back to the nervous system brings sense of balance back to the whole body and has an overall calming effect, it is always amazing to see it happen in real life! I'm so happy with your progress!"}<//Resp>< date>

<GmapID>0x80e8214a3ffc0eaf:0xe94e448bf831bf3d<//GmapID><review>So I took Dr. Alibhoy up on her offer of a free neck pillow and I absolutely love it. It really does make a difference. I just feel better after lying on it for a few, really a very few, minutes. I also enjoyed talking to her. She was extremely generous with her time and answered all my questions thoroughly and thoughtfully. She didn't try to push me into treatment, she simply let me know what she specializes in and how her methods of treatment work.< /review>< Time>

It was 2013 when I just happened upon Dr. Nimira, and I'm ever so thankful as my neck issues had been bothering me for a long time. The consistent treatments for many months along with a few adjustments made an incredible difference in the quality of my life, and all has gone really well for years now. As she says, do your research and have a good understanding of UCC so you can see how her practice can help you - you won't be disappointed.</review>

< review>
In fall 2018 I began having a problem with my neck and I thought I slept wrong.  After another month or two, the neck irritation had turned into constant tingling in two fingers in my right hand.  At this point I needed help.  I did a great deal of research and liked Dr. Nimira's approach to analysis and care.  In winter 2018 I went for my first visit and she showed me why I was having a problem and told me she could help.  I was more than ready.    I travel for work and Dr. Nimira was very flexible in working with me on my schedule.  After a few months of treatment and using the pillow EVERY day, the tingling in my fingers subsided then disappeared.  I am very happy with my personalized treatment plan,  the explanation of the process and my results.  I highly recommend Dr. Nimira!< /review>

I met with Dr. Nimira in her office in Agoura. What a lovely woman. She made me feel comfortable and discussed what using her free pillow would do for my neck pain. She had me try my new neck pillow while I was there.
The office was very calm and comforting. It was very enlightening.
I know I will be contacting  Dr. Nimira again soon.</text>

Dr. Alibhoy is amazing. She was able to help me feel what my neck and back should feel like normally. She gave me a neck pillow that has worked wonders for me in such a short amount of time. The relief was instant! She is very easy to talk to and I will be seeing her again soon.< /text>

When I first began going to Dr. Nimira I was suffering from severe neck pain due to my line of work and frequent migraines (multiple times weekly). I have been seeing her since the beginning of March, with a slight hiatus due to COVID-19, and I can honestly say that my neck rotation has greatly improved without pain and my migraines have been reduced to just a couple per month. I use the bone pillow religiously at home, too which helps, especially after a long day staring at the computer screen. Adjustments are slight and she’s all about posture and alignment, not maneuvering your bones and joints to hear them snap, crackle and pop.  Most of all, she listens and she cares!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

It's the "little" aches, pains and stressors that truly throws everything off balance, Dr. Nimira restores the balance and brings wellness to your body and quality of life!

For those of you who don't like to read long reviews, I'll cut to the chase.  Dr. Nimira is the caregiver to go to for complimentary medical care with MINIMAL ADJUSTMENTS.  Dr. Nimira is knowledgeable, experienced, caring, and effective.  I have been under her care for over a year now and it has been worth every minute and every penny.

I had a neck injury about 12 years ago that caused a chronic muscle problem.  I received traditional chiropractic care over the course of about 7 years and relief was always good but temporary.

I found Dr. Nimira on YELP and looked further into her website, it was a new approach that I had never heard of but it made complete sense.

Since receiving care from Dr. Nimira my neck has been consistently better, incidence of headaches is dramatically decreased and I have felt an improved overall state of well being.

Depending on your needs and the collaborative care plan that Dr. Nimira determines for you the length and frequency of visits can vary.  In the beginning it was necessary for me to go often, but it was an investment in the pain relief that I would later experience.  Now I see her once monthly to maintain the condition of my neck and Dr. Nimira addresses any other issue that is affecting my overall well being.</Review>

<name>Sara Moheb</name><review>Had a visit! Charges a lot for initial exam! and the whole process doesn't make sense! because if she fixes your problem why she doesn't take X-ray later on to prove she has done something! She said there is no need for x-ray even after adjustment! That mean nothing will get change! so you will pay only for 6 to 12 months to her!!! And I absolutely agree with the other review! Go do your research before going to Doctors like her!< /review>< response>
{'time': 1501537904108, 'text': "Dear Sara,\n\nAs a doctor, my interest is in making sure my patients are functioning at their best. I’ve checked my records and do not see that you’ve ever visited my office or called for a consultation. If this is a privacy concern for your personal identity, I would be happy to discuss this with you individually.\n\nI am surprised to see your review as many people who find their way into my office say that this is the first time chiropractic in practice has made sense to them in a logical way. I establish my patients with x-ray to determine any malformations, any red flags, as well as finding the location of the misalignment. It is not common in any style of chiropractic to take x-rays post-adjustment as it would be unethical to x-ray a patient every single time they needed an adjustment.\n\nUnlike most practitioners however, I DO post check my patients after an adjustment with the thermal scan to make sure their pattern has cleared before leaving the office. This is one of the few offices where a check will actually be done before a patient leaves the office. I do recommend post x-rays at the 6 month progress exam to show patients the progress that has happened with their care.\n\nLastly, I agree with your comment about doing your research. I highly recommend it with not only chiropractic, but all professionals. I don't take my care lightly and I want my patients to be ready and committed to the care that I have to offer if they choose to work with me. I have my reviews online, my website with interviews patient testimonials, and am always available to speak with anyone interested in having a conversation."}< /response>

Dr. Nimira is very kind and welcoming.  I have only had a consult with her so far, but she provided me with a lot of information and hope to overcome my migraines.  I would definitely recommend her if you suffer from migraines and vertigo.<//review>

Before coming to see Dr Nimira, my biggest problem was that I had my first ocular migraine in my life and I had never had migraines prior. I was having neck, shoulder, and back issues while I was playing tennis for my job and in my day to day chores.

Now that I've been under care, my vision has definitely improved and before I was feeling tired all the time. My shoulders a re looser and my back feels better. I haven't had a migraine since the first one.

I would tell someone who's not sure about care that is is more of a holistic view. You have to be patient, but when things start working, you're improving and things just vanish and you're worry free! The pain goes away and your body feels like its learning and retraining itself to how it should be.

My current care is going very well too! Every time I go to her or have a question about my body she always knows or finds me the answer to my problem and I'm on my way to healing my body.</review>

Very effective diagnosis and treatment plan.  Minimal adjustments.  After a few months of treatment my body is now properly aligned.  No longer have neck and shoulder pain I began with.  Dr Nimura is wonderful, kind and considerate. Most important is she helped me achieve  the desired results by providing effective lasting treatments.<//Review>

I had used 7 different chiropractors over my life. Most of those doctors never educated me about the purpose of chiropractic, and worse, none of them helped me achieve spinal corrections, despite years of treatment and thousands of dollars spent., not to mention painful adjustments, and intense neck wrenching moves.

At nearly 50 years of age, I was frequently depressed and felt incapable of organizing my thoughts to improve my business, which was struggling. I prayed for helping in healing my body and mind, and then got a call from Dr Nimira, whom I had recently met.

Within one year of PAINLESS ADJUSTMENTS (no neck wrenching!), my x-rays proved that the curves in my spine had been restored to their proper alignment. About half-way through my treatment, I began to feel more powerful and in control of myself, and made several deeply needed personal and professional changes. I got clean and sober, dropped nearly 25 lbs., removed all unhealthy foods from my diet, and was able to organize and implement changes in my business that caused me at attract a steady flow of new and satisfied clients.

I am confident that improved function of my central nervous system played a major role in my desire and ability to take better care of myself. I have never been happier, healthier, or more prosperous. Dr Nimira was literally an answered prayer!<//text>

<Review>After 20+ years since a car accident impacted my neck due to whiplash, and countless dollars spent on specialists, Dr. Alibhoy has been able to pinpoint and treat the problem and I've never felt better.  It is truly remarkable that for the most part, I am pain free!
I know that it will take some time to fully get back on track, however, I am thankful that I found a chiropractor who knows what to do (and more importantly what NOT to do)!
Thank you!

It's been 3 years since I reviewed Dr. Alibhoy and I am grateful to remain pain free, with minimal adjustments required (maybe 3 total in a year!).  I only wish I had found her sooner!<//Review><user_id>107910180059892463289<//user_id>< Time>

I've been treated by several chiropractors, but none that took the time to explain and evaluate my situation like Dr. Nimira.  I had a chronic pain in my left hip area and a sore knee when I started her protocol.  Today I am  pain free in my hip and nearly pain free in my knee.  Dr. Nimira is sensitive, kind and listens with her heart as well as her head.  I highly recommend Dr. Nimira!</Review>

My husband and I had been trying for a baby for about 7 months before I started seeing Dr. Nimira. I was totally stressed out! My hair was falling out, my skin was terrible...I just did not feel like myself. After about a month of seeing her, I started to feel like normal again. After my first adjustment, I felt more calm and centered. I have been seeing Dr. Nimira for 6 months now, and 4 months into it, I became pregnant with my first child. At 15 weeks, I'm doing extremely well. I feel like I'm the healthiest I've been in awhile and I have the peace of mind that my baby is growing in a clear, healthy environment. She is amazing!!! I am so grateful to have met her.<//Text>

<review>Before finding Dr. Nimira I had a lot of pain. A lot of back pain, neck pain, and a lot of headaches. I definitely had all sorts of joint pains and I would grit my teeth when I would sleep.

My life now is 100% better. I don't have back pain any more or neck pain. My headaches have gone from a 10 to a 1.2 and slowing getting better. I don't have any more pain to really complain about, it's really great.

I'm happier now that I don't have those things. Everything here is really professional. The adjustments are easy and the resting time is so relaxing. Dr. Nimira is a one of a kind chiropractor!< /review><date>1502684213257< /date>< Rating>

My life is great now. I always have to show everyone how I can lift my arm up because before I couldn't do it. Dr. Nimira did an amazing job and I love it.

Going forward I would imagine if anything goes wrong I would check in with Dr. Nimira first. Its funny that my husband has never met Dr. Nimira but reminds me to check in with her if he hears me mention something that doesn't feel normal.

I also do a lot of things that I couldn't do before like training and going to the gym all the time. I've learned there is such a wide variety of things Dr. Nimira can help with.<//text>< Pics>

Dr. Nimira was able to restore my health and put an end to 20 years of headaches.  I had tried everything before, physical therapy, regular chiropractors, acupuncture, but Dr. Nimira was able to perform her subtle adjustments and I no longer get those horrible, debilitating headaches!  She is so smart and has a great bedside manner.<//Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1498665803886, 'text': 'Dear Aharon,\n\nAs a doctor, my interest is in making sure my patients are functioning at their best. I’ve checked my records and do not see that you’ve ever visited my office or called for a consultation. If this is a privacy concern for your personal identity, I would be happy to discuss this with you individually.\n\nYou may have heard that I only work with patients for 6-12 months at a time. This is partially correct information. In any health profession, if you’re coming in with a chronic health problem, your provider will recommend a longer term care plan to ensure lasting success. If you’re coming in with a chronic neurological problem, then I too am going to recommend the care I believe will solve and stabilize the problem you came in with. That’s just how the body works.\n\nThis system has worked well for my patients and I do stand by it. While I educate patients on the possibility of care over 6 months duration, I do not often recommend or accept payment for care beyond the first 6 months, and my patients can vouch for this. The reason for this is that many times after the progress exam is completed at the 6 month period, my patients are actually having such good results they are able to skip over the secondary corrective period to potential maintenance or longer breaks between check ups based on their individual success.\n\nIf you’d like to speak with me about something specifically, please do feel free to reach out by phone or email, I’m always interested in personally taking care of patients needs and am happy to find time in my schedule.\n\nBest Wishes,\nDr. Nimira Alibhoy'}</Resp>< review>
She wants to put you on 6 to 12 months treatment. All her reviews on her yelp page and here are done by hers and are paid.

Avoid going to her. She just cares about money and wants you to come to her for 6 or 12 months. So she can charge you....

She doesn't even have an assistance...nobody works for her....Do not recommend at all.< /review>

I have been seeing Dr. Nimira since October 2016 for chronic neck problems stemming from a car accident when I was 18 years old. I think it's important that you know that I am also a chiropractor!

As a fellow chiropractor, I have been under care and evaluated by many doctors. It was always a little frustrating to me that my adjustments would not hold and that I wouldn't get lasting relief.

Dr. Nimira is not the first upper cervical chiropractor I've seen, but the one I saw previously was located 2.5 hours away from where I lived. Continuing to drive for care became difficult due to time constraints.

In the beginning of my care, I needed to be adjusted every visit. I wasn't noticing big changes in how I felt, but I know that healing takes time, and I was committed to giving upper cervical chiropractic care a chance. I had heard many success stories, and wanted that for myself.

Up until then, my shoulders and neck had been tight and in spasm for years; I got massages regularly and often did muscle work on my own neck at night before bed. My neck always hurt, and I was constantly stretching and rubbing it trying to get some relief.

About 4 months into the process, my adjustments starting "holding" and I would leave her office without getting adjusted. This is about the time that I started really noticing a difference in how I felt!

I finally realized that I hadn't needed to do muscle work in a few weeks, and that my neck didn't hurt anymore.

As of my last visit, I have been "holding" my adjustment for 6 weeks. My neck still feels great.

I highly recommend Dr. Nimira! If you are looking for top notch upper cervical chiropractic care, look no further.</review>

I was involved in a car accident and had received treatment from numerous health care providers and doctors before finding Dr. Nimira and upper cervical treatment.  Since receiving care from Dr. Nimira I have experienced less neck and shoulder pain, less dizziness and less TMJ issues.  She is supportive, knowledgable and provides excellent care!<//text>

I am extremely grateful to have found Dr. Nimira. I was receiving regular chiropractic care before my move, but was getting frustrated about the need for ongoing visits and so many adjustments. I fell out of care after we moved, but was brought back to it following a car accident. That is when I found Dr. Nimira and was introduced to upper cervical chiropractic care.

I have experienced a number of other holistic care approaches to varying degrees of success.
Knowing a car accident can greatly trigger a Fibromyalgia flair and leave a single mom unable to care for child, I was really concerned. I couldn't move my neck very far and was in pain despite all the important self-care techniques I have picked up over the years. I needed an experienced assessment and evaluation.

Dr. Nimira helped fill in many of the blanks. The car injury definitely messed me up, but before it could cause lasting damage, I was seen by Dr. Nimira. Some of my other symptoms that would have gotten even worse post-car accident stabilized and improved under her care. Most importantly, I am feeling the changes on a systemic level and they are lasting. Life is stressful and not always conducive to taking time for self-care. When I had a break in other therapies due to non-supportive life circumstances, my other providers were impressed with how well I was doing and improving "on my own", which is to say, under Dr. Nimira's care.

It's a process. You have to be able to set aside some time and space and give your body the opportunity to learn and adjust. That said, there is no time like the present to get started in living your best self. People stay in pain or otherwise ill with systemic disorders for decades before getting on the path to better health. When you have been out of sync with your best functioning body for a while, the body adjusts and it can take some time to adjust back. Dr. Nimira takes you through the full process as quickly as one body can go including a whole host of other supportive lifestyle remedies to help get you to your best health.

I have to come to Dr. Nimira further along in my journey than most, but I wish I had met her early on. I believe it would have saved me a lot of time, pain, and unnecessary expenditures. If you are looking to improve your body function, under Dr. Nimira's care is an excellent place to begin no matter where you are in your journey.</Review>

I have had neck and jaw pain for 10 years, about 3 years ago I noticed it worsening, when noticed a correlation to my cycle. I started peri-menopause the pain increased. I tried so many other therapies all helped some but not enough nor non were long lasting. When I started upper cervical treatment with Dr. Nimira I was going thru a very stressful time in life, but after a couple months of treatment I began to see and feel a difference. The pain changed, my body was adjusting and my need for spinal chiropractic adjustments dropped significantly (none in 6 months). During this time I noticed muscular (and tendon) bodywork was the last adjustment needed to become pain free. I can say my pain was gone for months ! Only returning during my cycle changes and / or life stresses but at such a small percentage as previously experienced. Today I keep up with my maintenance treatments Dr Nimira and my neck / jaw pain is no longer the source of "pain" in my life.</Review>

I had 2 wedding dresses to clean and 1 to preserve. My wedding alterations lady highly recommended this business. They were super professional and friendly and got the red wine 🍷 stains out of the wedding dresses. The one was boxed with the veil nicely and other ready for second non covid wedding next year (we hope). Prices for the service were very fair
Thank you!</Text>

The cashier was so friendly and efficient.  I had left a ring in the pocket of a jacket, the staff kept it safe for me until I could come get it.   They took great care with removing the stains from my clothing.

Great customer service; professional and honest</Text>

I've used Polo Cleaners in San Juan Capistrano for years.  They have great customer service and do an amazing job on dry cleaning and alterations.   Their delivery service makes dry cleaning drop off and pick up so convenient.< /text>

<Text>I love Polo Cleaners! They have consistently high quality on cleaning and I love their delivery service. I have even gotten pants hemmed without leaving the house by pinning them and attaching a note that I'd like them hemmed. It doesn't get any easier than that! Their delivery person is also very friendly and helpful. I appreciate how flexible they've been during the pandemic too, as our dry cleaning volume has definitely decreased like so many others as we work from home more often now. Highly recommend!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

We have used Polo for a while now. They make it so easy. They pick up and drop of our cleaning. They are extremely professional and friendly. Recently, I had two heavy draperies cleaned, the white backing was really soiled over the years. I got it back and I was truly amazed at how beautiful they turns out. The were just like new and the price was very reasonable.
They will continue to have my business!< /text>

I have had regular pickup and delivery with Polo Cleaners, probably for the last 20 years.

During the Covid19 they reduced their delivery day down to one day a week, and because of the decrease in my needs - I didn't even know!

I dropped off some table cloths asking for return delivery to be my regular day. They were so nice! Didn't clue me in to the fact there wasn't a delivery day; and then the order was rushed and delivered to me anyway by the sweet woman behind the counter.

They do repairs on garments - and everything gets great care. I have been a happy customer for over 20 years.< /Text>

We have been using Polo Cleaners for over two years and on a regular basis. From dry cleaning suits, to comforters and regular laundering. We have used most of their services.

There have been a few occasions where we were overcharged, and there was an obvious attitude from the staff when approaching.

There have been occasions where items have gone missing.

There have been occasions where the seamstress has completely wrecked sinple items.

With every fragile, expensive or important item, we have asked Polo IN PERSON, if you hey we're confident in being able to service the item.

Most recently they accepted an item that was very old and priceless. They fully understood the importance and fragility of this item. They returned it at a premium with iron burns and new stain.  When showing obvious displeasure, they offered to remedy the situation within a few hours.  They delivered the item, with stains partially removed... And holes left in its place.

Here's where it gets bad.. their response was,"Well, there's nothing we can do about it now." We mentioned that we will voice our opinion about our experience with their service. Their response, " We've been in business for 25 years, your opinion won't make a difference."

I can understand if this was a discount place, but they are double to triple the price of anyone in the area. When paying a premium, there should be premium service that treats their customers well. This place has proven to be the opposite. Time and time again. Shame on us for giving them another chance.

Others in our community have experienced the same type of issues with Polo over the past few years. Luckily, they provided plenty of recommendations in the area.

Go somewhere else unless you want a repeat of the same.< /Text>

<review>Polo Cleaners in San Juan Capistrano is a top notch business.  They have done careful, excellent work on all the many pieces of clothing I have sent them!  I have pick up service which is awesome, because I might be excellent at getting my items in to a dry cleaners, but am terrible about getting around to picking them up.  I don't have enough dry cleaning to be sending stuff for every pick up, so I can contact them by email or by phone to ask for a pick up on what would be my regular day.  That way their driver doesn't have to waste a trip to my home.  I think this has worked out well for both of us.  They can clean and press the most difficult pieces of clothing and always return it with amazing attention to detail (tissue in sleeves of delicate blouses, for instance).  It is definitely not the cheapest place around, but I really believe that they have prolonged the life of my dry-cleanable and laundered clothing (i.e., my husband's dress shirts) by being very careful with each piece.  This has saved me money in the long run.  And they are just plain nice, professional, and helpful!  I highly recommend them!</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Polo Coeaners is an outstanding dry-cleaning business.
Here are some highlight:
1. All the team members are highly respectful. They don't argue with customer over details that customer is concernee about. They try to fix the very rare cases that might have been overlooked.
2. They pay extra attention at several steps by different people to make sure they pinpoint all the stains.
3. They go extra mile and do extra details that now-a-days other cleaners rarely do. From paying attention to collar pointers to buttoning up rear pant pockets, to putting extra support to collar so it remains straight, to folding shirt arms inwards so they don't get wrinkled when multiple shirts are stacked.

I highly recommend them.< /text>< gmapID>

Your cleaners did a great job. Such a nice touch to put the fake buttons in my husbands shirts with the french cuffs, the buttons held them in place. And my sweaters looked like new, and tied up with cute bows! We will be back.< /text>

I needed a new cleaners and thought I'd try Polo. I thought it was super expensive and didn't get an article of clothing cleaned to my liking, along with a comforter that is now white and not cream. Customer Service was kind, but that's all I got.  Will look for another cleaners in the area.</Text>

I have played Santa Claus for years in San Juan. I just picked up my Santa suit at Polo Cleaners and they said "No charge, cuz you're Santa". They really do have the Christmas spirit all year long.</Review>

There is hair shop inside of the Palace Beauty. It was time for a change, I grew tired of the brown I had and wanted to change it up to something new for the summer. I showed Kimberly a picture of this burgundy color I found and she delivered it looks exactly like the photo I showed her if not better. You can buy salon product as Half price and can apply right away at the salon inside of the beauty shop! Awesome!! Here is the result!< /Text>

I am super thankful for this store being so complete with all Covid19 weapons.
As I am planning my air traveling, I was able to get superior masks from South Korea and some face coverings as recommended by the staff.

She was really friendly and informative. The employees here are fluent in Korean and English. They have masks from China and also ones from Korea. Also a variety of hand sanitizers that don't have funky smells.

Thank you for working for the health of Los Angeles!!!<//Text>

Love how chill this place is. They let you test almost EVERY product they have and they don't push you to buy the more expensive items like some other stores. I asked for help to find the best skin care products for my acne, and I am loving my new toner & mask pack and super amazing suncream!! Will definitely recommend to family and friends</Review>

Horrible customer service. They do not acknowledge you unless you look like someone with a lot of money to spend. Exchanging anything is a pain as they make you feel so guilty. Never coming back here ever again, they can close down and go out of business for all I care.< /review>

I’m very concern about this facility, It needs to be more security. Too many people going in and out. It’s the second time some one broke my lock and stole my stuff. The first time was 1 month ago and today the second time. They didn’t change the door sheets and 1 was broken and when I request they they said that it’s taking long to get hem arrive.<//review>

Overpriced. And sometimes unit is unaccessible if any neighboring customers are at their units. (One narrow lane between buildings. Also rented 2 units on the phone. One for my surplus property, and one for my boat, wasn't told my boat and its trailer had to be registered and insured until the day I showed up with my property to move in. Info I should have been told over the phone during  my initial call. So, I had to find another place to store my boat that day. In the middle of my move. Stressed me out.</text>

This is the safest, cleanest storage facility in all of Orange County. On top of that the staff made it a place where you are treated with respect and care. Mira And Elvia exceeded the requirements of being professional, dependable and over all really good people. My experience with smart stop was one I will never forget and for that Thank you:) B<//Review>

Reserved online and drove in for my scheduled appointment. Space was ready for move in and pretty painless so far. They seem to have good cctvs too. They require a disc lock, can be purchased at the office if you don’t have one. Workers are quite friendly.< /review>

I am really impressed by this facility. Usually I hate renting a storage unit. Mariah in the office had a very friendly and helpful attitude, the gate hours are very accommodating 6am to 10pm. Office is open sundays & the facility was clean. Aisles are wide and ALL units are drive up units. No elevators needed, no going down endless hallways. Installing  any kind of lighting in or near the units would be handy as you can't see after dark and units are open until 20pm
Don't forget your flashlights<//review>

This place by far is the worst I have ever been to.  The 2 lady's that work there and live there have the worse service and people skills. Not to mention how mean and rude and there actions are appolling and I'm sure corporate would hate to know how they treat there custimers.  I'm not the only one. There are others that are working a case on them that's how bad they are. Place would be great if they got rid of the workers there. Real talk< /Text>

<Review>My experience at Smart Stop was very pleasant,the staff there is well trained and provides excellent customer service. I rented there twice in the past two years, the service only get's better there. The staff Elvia, Myra and all the people there, care about customer's,  there needs and the site has really good surveillance cameras and keep a good watch on the property.  It's a good neighborhood and people the rent there are  nice people. If you need a storage with really good pricing and service, give them a call.<//Review>< pics>

Not Only Did they have several units n sizes available, Thier staff especially Myra was informative, helpful, nice and i couldnt ask for a more genuine individual to assist me. SMARTSTOP IM IMPRESSED!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I heard about this facility when I came back from Sacramento I stopped in and the most handsome fellow, Juan helped me out and offered me assistance. The units available weren't really what I was looking for and this property was a little further out than I wanted to be so he referred me over to the smartstop property in Garden Grove. Juan was so kind and handsome a delicious little Mexican sweet treat I could've just gobbled him up! Thank you so much Juan!<//Text><name>Rose Davis< /name><user>104362656606013794029<//user></record>

Upon entering the business I was immediately acknowledged by a charming young lady named Myra, who was very professional and assisted me with answers to every question I had.
She showed herself to understand what customer service is and it was a pleasure doing business with her the SmartStop-Westminster street in Garden Grove location, that in my opinion is very fortunate to have her as an employee.
Being a Regional Vice President of Operations, here in Orange County, and oversee over 600 employees and over 160 accounts as well, i rarely have the opportunity to see employees conduct themselves professionally as Myra did,
As well as display job knowledge like she did.

Best regards,

Roger Murrel</review>

My brother used Extra Space Storage in Los Alamitos and had a good experience.  Elvia made it very easy for me to rent my space and even after I had moved in called to check on me to see if everything was going well for me.  Any time I have had questions or needed something she was very accommodating and helpful.  I would recommend this location to any of my friends who are looking to rent a storage space.  I just want to thank her personally for making my experience in renting storage a positive one.<//Text>< GmapID>

Extra Space storage are the third owners since I have been renting at this facility. I am very impress with the new companies policies and improvements of which they have made and will continue to rent from them for as long as I have storage needs.
I would highly recommend renting from them to anyone looking for good safe storage for their things. Laura helped us, and she was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Couldn't be happier!  =D<//Text>

<text>I have been at this facility since mid 2014 and it has undergone several changes in ownership since then however they always make it seamless and easy for the tenants. The manager Elvia is a gem, she is friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and incredibly efficient. The customer service is always top notch and they remember you by name which is such a small detail but means so much. It makes me feel like they care about me and my belongings and I am not just a face but a person.
In the many years I have stored at this facility I have never had any issues whatsoever, it is very clean and quiet, there is no rif-raff hanging around the facility and it is very safe, I highly recommend using this facility for your storage needs, you will not be sorry you did.
Thank you SmartStop Santa Ana, you guys are AMAZING!!!!< /text></record>

<Text>My storage unit was broken into this month.  Not very secure at all.  No cameras or lights by my row of storage unit.  And the office was not helpful at all.  The I requested to get reimbursement for this month since I didn't get use it for the whole month and they couldn't even reimburse me for it.  They even have cut my lock to break in.  They barley chipped the wall and broke in and stole all my valuables.  I asked for them to investigate and all they told me was deal with my insurance company.  It's a gated storage unit with code access to get in.  The items they stole were way too heavy to throw over the fence, so I had to be an inside job.  Someone in there with gate/code access.  I would not recommend this place.  At night time there are way too many dark spots with no light or cameras.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I couldn't be anymore happier getting my storage. LAURA helped me out and took the time to show me a storage. When we got to the storage,  she noticed that the wall on one side was slanted. Instead of just leaving it she fixed it. Plus she offered to show me another one and suggested I get it .. it was much better. She was kind, patient, and very helpful.< /Review><time>1452896888321</time><Gmap_id>0x80dd27f57ee0273b:0x70a1b06fd14cd9c1</Gmap_id>< Pics>

This place sucks. They change their name too frequently and hike up the rent with every name change & pretty much every single chance they get. The property itself is pretty clean but the individual units are falling apart, dirty af & not very safe. The walls may be drywall and they are cracking & warping. The only thing that redeems this place and the reason they get a 2nd star is because the staff is cool. They've always been very nice & helpful.</Review>

<review>Stay Away! Worst storage in Orange County! This place is filthy, run down, infested with rats and the staff is rude and incompetent. Unless you want your belongings chewed to destruction and covered in rat feces and urine...find somewhere else. After 1 month of renting with Extra Space, I opened my unit and the stench of rat urine was overwhelming. I found 2 dead rats and there was rat droppings everywhere. The precious newborn clothes I planned to save forever were riddled with holes from the rats chewing. Even plastic and metal items has rat chew holes or bite marks in them.
When I complained and said I wanted my unit moved, the manager told me they were aware of the rats and there was nothing that could be done. I wish they had told me that when I moved in. I've rented at other storage facilities and never had this problem. I live out of state and demanded they at least move my belongings to another unit, which they never did do. Everything I had stored was completely beyond repair. There was nothing that could be salvaged. If you plan to rent at the Extra Space Storage at 4200 Westminster Blvd, Santa Ana,  CA 92703 you are better off just throwing your belongings in the trash and saving your cash.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1471622377969, 'text': 'Hi Jennifer, we are sorry to hear this.

<Review>After finding myself in need of a new storage unit,I found this place.after a few unforseen delays in setting up my new unit,Elvia and Laura stayed late and worked it out with me to get me set up.
They are great at what they do, and my new unit was even.cleaned.
Highly Recommended!!
Thank Youcladies......< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a unit and it was infested with rats. Once i told them about the situation they denied to pay any damages to my property due to the rat infestation. I had pictures of damages and they still refused. Bad place to keep your things if they are of value to you.<//review>

Looking for a place to save our belongings at the last minute was very stressfull, this place was the first one we visited and we didn't want to look for other place. Elvia took care of our storage needs, she knew what we nèeded and she made the process so easy and affortable and not only is the location is very clean  but it also makes me feel save. I know our belogigns are in the right place, the staff are so efficient and helpful.</Review>

<Text>I have a big fear of going to the dentist, like a lot of people. So I chose Sheets, Paquette & Wu because they specialize in sedation dentistry. Their techniques and practices put me at ease. The team that works with each dentist is superior in every way. The quality of work and care is extraordinary. Highly recommend Dr. Sheets.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Dr. Wu saw me this day as I had an emergency prior to a holiday weekend.  She listened to my history (first time with her as a patient), took notes, explained everything she found and what the best options were.  She had a very gentle touch and manner, and was very thorough.<//review>< Rating>

Always the best.  From the office staff to Dr. Paquette and my dental  hygienist for over 40 years Barbara Page.  It is always a comfortable, efficient operation.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Nigel Bailey</Text>

The doctors and staff have taken a very high level of precaution to protect their patients from Covid 19.  Dr. Sheets is excellent at her work and the staff is always top notch.  I trust them entirely.  They've helped me a great deal with a very difficult situation.< /Review>

Michelle is wonderful coordinating my appointments with great care, Christie was so personable and detailed with my teeth cleaning, and Dr. Wu squeezed me in for my semi-annual review next week!

Everything was perfect at my cleaning today with Connie, I was concerned about covid 19 but felt completely safe in the amazingly clean fresh purified air and all the extra precautions adopted. I would describe this office as dental heaven, the best of the best.</Review>

Dr. Paquette is the dentist’s dentist. That should say it all, but I will elaborate.

I am a dentist in northern California and I needed to replace multiple aging restorations. I asked myself, if I could choose any dentist, who would I want to work on my case? Dr. Jacinthe Paquette, world renowned for her skills and expertise, immediately came to mind and I decided to travel to Newport to see her.

Beyond her outstanding clinical abilities, what further sets Dr. Paquette apart is her approachability and her esthetic sense. She is also a perfectionist, using a microscope to refine her work. In terms of ideal dentistry, it doesn’t get better than this.

Dr. Paquette works in concert with an amazing lab technician, Hiroki, who is a master of his art. His ceramic restorations are both beautiful and functional.

As a dentist, I scrutinized all aspects of her practice from infection control through completion of treatment. Her chair-side team and front office are capable and professional. My experience with Dr. Paquette was flawless.  She more than lives up to her reputation of excellence. I consider my extensive treatment under her care the best healthcare decision I have made, ever. I recommend her without reservation.< /review>

They are just the best of the best; the very top in quality and service.  They go out of their way to please.  Not cheap,  but the best care (such as what they give) is worth it!< /review>

I love Sheets & Paquette. Dr Paquette is a spectatcular dentist, is fun to work with, & is a world class beauty. I had a complete reconstruction due to an accident & she made it as pleasant as possible every step of the way. I actually look forward to going in for dental work when I know I get to see her & work with her terrific staff. She is a 10 in every way!<//Text>

Doctors Sheets, Paquette & Wu and their dental practice assistants take the nightmares out of dentistry.  Seriously! The outstanding experience — and it is truly an extremely positive experience — begins when the assistants welcome you into the office. It is evident that the team is highly trained, always anticipating your needs in advance. With compassion, they begin the excellent caring process that Doctors Sheets, Paquette & Wu and their practitioners always achieve.

I have been treated by all three doctors — and can readily recommend each. There is not one who is better than the other two. All three are personable and extend themselves with empathy and graciousness. Besides being highly recognized in the dental industry for their individual accomplishments, each doctor is a perfectionist in their science, which is always good news when it comes to your health as well as the beauty of your smile.</Text>

<review>I am happy to report 18 years of exceptional care by Dr Sheets and her colleagues. Exceptional for more than one way: she is clearly a leader in her field not only in her practice but in her cutting edge academic research and her consistent uncompromising perfectionism even in face of complications which, I might say, is important if you not only want to have excellent dental health but want to look good as well... I always look forward to my visits and being treated with kindness and accommodation by the caring professional staff. Never a compromise in excellence for 18 years!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I know I am in good hands with Dr. Wu. Her gentle and thorough approach shows how much she cares for her patients. Thank you, Dr. Wu!

For over 5 years I have been given excellent service and their staff are very accommodating.

Finest dental care and friendly staff. The doctors, assistants and hygienists are highly experienced. I would recommend Sheets, Paquette and Wu Dental Practice to anyone in need of dental care including the most complex restorative work.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dce08f365b0ab9:0x49aaa9a758c4a552</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Sheets, Paquette, & Wu is Orange County's premier dental practice.  I can say this because I have made teeth for hundreds of dentists since 1976 and have never seen such meticulous dentistry as these ladies practice.  Their level of expertise is matched by an equal concern for the comfort of every patient.  Give them the opportunity to meet your dental needs.  Their busy practice always has an open door for new patients.<//text>

Dr. Sheets and Paquette are the BEST cosmetic dentists in California.
I have been a patient for over 15 years.
There office is extremely  qualified to handle any dental problem imaginable.
Their lab is on their office site with the best technicians available in America.
I rate them Five star "top of the mountain".

Dr. Sheets was my dentist for many years and through a terrible choice ..to support a friend's sister Dentist in the area I changed.  $44,000 later, with a mouth full of teeth I couldn't keep in my mouth, Dr. Sheets took me back and pulled the bad work out and replaced it with wonderful, working teeth.  She is a wonderful person, kind and so very talented.  If she had time we, all of her patients, would like her as a friend.<//text>

Going to the dentist has never been my favorite thing to do. However, once I started going to Drs. Sheets, Paquette and Wu's Dental Practice all my apprehensions disappeared. The office waiting room is so calming and the front office personal are exceptional in welcoming you and making you feel comfortable. My dental hygienist, Barbara Page, is exceptional...giving the very best cleaning I have ever had with attention to every detail. Dr. Wu is terrific! She explains everything she is doing and is also aware of my feeling of claustrophobia so she always makes sure that I am okay. Can't say enough about this practice!!!!<//text>

I have had the great pleasure of having each of the Drs. Sheets, Paquette and Wu work with me and each of them is highly professional and they all do excellent work.

I have had crowns and veneers and all sorts of other work done by this practice and their lab makes the most realistic crowns and veneers that you will ever find.  No one ever knows that they are not my own teeth!

The SP&W Dental Practice has seen me through many dental situations, including TMJ, post-jaw surgery care, the crowns and veneers mentioned above and all around regular dental care and I have referred them to others in my family.

<Review>I'd like to take this opportunity to share with any investigating patient, that Drs. Sheets, Paquette & Wu, along with their entire team are absolutely phenomenal!  Since 2009, I've served this practice as their Invisalign Territory Manager treating orthodontics, and now with Ez Sleep, helping them treat patients that suffer with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  I know first hand that they provide nothing but the best care for their patients.  Beyond their doctors, their state of the art technology and training center, the staff here makes you feel right at home.  In fact, waiting in their lobby is like sitting in a family room - as Brenda and team ensure your comfort with bottled water and a smile.  I would highly recommend any patients seeking exceptional care, from doctors that care.  :-)<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Wonderful customer service, One is the best customer experiences I've had in any smoke shop. The employees take the time to get to know their regular customers And always make you feel welcome.  Their prices are very fair and reasonable and typically less than most other stores. I smoke a brand of cigarettes not normally found very easily locally or anywhere I've searched in california and the  Owner didn't hesitate to go out of his way to track them down for me. And even tho I believe I am the only customer buying them, he always makes sure to keep them in stock for me. They also carry a great selection of E cigarrettes, flavors and accessories as well as many other smoking accessories and novelties. They have a  Loyal customer as far as I am concerned!<//Review>

Great place and some stores give 20% discounts for military which is great easy place to spend my money 💰  I picked up 8 Reebok T-Shirts and 6 pair of Reebok Shorts and 3 Reebok Sweat Pants and 1 Reebok Sweat jacket and 1 pair of Reebok slippers and 2 Michael Kors shirts.... I spent 300.00 in the Reebok store along .....</review>

Great selection great prices vs every other shop I've seen. They keep there shop stuffed with products unlike most shops that only have a few shelves. They value their customers and will make sure that you want to come back again.< /Review>

Horrible prices. If I wanted to get taxed I would rather go to Empire in Vacaville. Don’t support this shop</Text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Needed to have my dog checked out due to allergies in her skin, they were very helpful in working out a reasonably solution that didn't cost us a fortune. She is doing much better after 3 days. Staff is helpful, though I wish the doctor would try to seek less expensive treatments to help pet owners that can't afford 600 dollars for 1 visit, fortunately ours was worked out to 280, still, I wish they could be a little more understanding during times like these when money is tight.<//text>< Date>

Do NOT waste your time coming here. All they will do is take your money and refer you elsewhere because this place is NOT a hospital. They should properly name themselves a Clinic, for minimal services.
I thought I would give them a shot since I was new to the neighborhood, but I will continue to go to Hamilton Animal Hospital 2 miles down the road where they can actually treat your pets and not waste your time & cause more lingering trauma to your furbabe.<//text>

I am extremely pleased with the care that my pug puppy has received at Adams Pet Clinic. The whole staff, but especially Dr. Gill, have answered all my questions about raising a healthy pug puppy, and none of my  questions have ever seemed too silly to them. My puppy, Domino, us never unwilling to go to his regularly scheduled visits. I highly recommend the Adams Pet Clinic for veterinary  services.<//text>

The staff is very rude. Clearly they don’t care about animals because when we asked to help one of our pets and give a small rescue rate, we are a nonprofit organization, they refused. To me that says a lot about them. It’s not that we wanted their services for free. We rescue hundreds of dogs, we always pay our bills and as a nonprofit who is doing constant great work, we should be able to get a small discount .  This vet only cares about profit.<//Text>

<text>Dr. Gil is an amazingly knowledgeable vet.  He saved my dog from a terrible episode of 3 bacteria that she got at a boarding facility.  She coughed for over 2 months but with his treatment she came through and is fine. Highly recommend Adams Pet clinic.< /text><time>1568240984937</time>< userid>

I have been with Adams Pet Clinic since before Dr. Gill took over. He has taken care of 9 of my dogs/cats over the years.  He is very honest, knowledgeable  and caring veterinarian.  Staff are always friendly.  Never have to wait very long, unless there is an emergency.<//Review>

Great vet.  Also, you can get your pets shots up to date without being charged additionally for an office visit.  Not many vets do that.  I've tried a few local vets, but these guys are my choice as the best.< /text>

I had two cats that lived to advanced ages and I credit Dr. Gill's excellent care with keeping them going for so long. When their final time came Dr. Gill and his staff were there to help. He is a kind vet who is generous with his time and is gentle with the patients. In over 50 years of pet ownership, he is one of the best vets I've dealt with.< /Text>

He is gentle and has always put my dogs and cats at ease as soon as he walks in the door. He makes sure you completely understand and takes phone calls to assist you along the way. I can't say enough about this fabulous Vet. We love him!

Dr. Gil is smart and compassionate.
For many years he has provided well care,  management of serious illnesses and sadly euthanasia for my beloved pets. I trust him and recommend him most highly.</Text>

Dr. Gill and staff are absolutely the best. After seeing many Vets in Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley, and being disappointed with their service and charges, Adams Pet Clinic was recommended to me by a family member. After one visit I was convinced that they would be my Vet Office from then on. Everyone is caring, professional, and never suggest or charge for unnecessary services. My little Maltipoo loves them too.</review>

< Review>
There are good and bad things about this location. The good side is that the staff inside are nice to you. They take care of you quick; however, the front desk is very unprofessional. I have a 10 am appointment. As usual, they always make me fill out a form where you have to answer questionnaire about whethere you were sick or not. They take your temperature and make you right down your phone number so they could call you back. I have been waiting for over an hour and was wondering how come they're not calling me.  I don't want to complain, but it's ridiculous. I ask the receptionist why is it taking long for them to give me call and she asked me if I have made a payment already (which I clearly did, because I know that they're not going to see you unless you paid). Then she told to me to fill out another form. I told her that she just made me fill out a form over an hour ago and then she was trying to find it and she told me she doesn't have it. How do you lose it?! These people at the front desk does not care about their patients. They're very unprofessional and unorganized. I work at a customer service as well and I'm telling you this is NOT how you should be dealing / treating your customer/patient. I made an early appointment to be seen early because I have other things to do. I am not to stand here and wait for 2 hours. What's the point of having an appointment if you're not going to be seen at the time you're supposed to be seen. Pointless.< /Review>

I had to wait long during my first visit, but not the second and the rest of my appointments. Overall I had a great experience, from the front desk representative, x-ray technician, dental assistant and dental surgeon were all friendly and patient. I also would like to thank Oumaima for being very friendly and kind, always smile and welcoming. Thank you for making my experience here comfortable.</Text>

I really want to thank the manager suleyma for such a great experience. She made me feel comfortable and made my appointment so smooth. I had explained to her that it had been a long time since I’ve been to the dentist and was a little nervous. She assured me that they had the best team and i will be taken care of she made sure of that. Had treatment done the same day and i had such pleasant care by the doctor and the assistant. Im glad i chose this office!  It will forever be my new dental home.</review>

First time at this location I had two appointments same day, braces consultation (they said it was free so why not) and a cleaning. It was a horrible first time experience honestly they were like 1+ hour plus behind and I waited hours to get JUST xrays done when I wanted a cleaning. I let it go and gave them another shot because it happens places do get behind. Next few appointments I got cleaning and some fillings which went well EXCEPT the last filling. The dentist drilled into a tooth that I had already gotten a filling in the previous visit. When he noticed it already had a filling he went to check xrays. I felt with my tongue what tooth it was and realized it was the tooth i got a filling in last time so I told the dental assistant about it and then told the dentist when he was back. He said it wasn't in the paper he had in the room with us. My question is how is that possible. It should have been because now he unnecessarily  drilled into the wrong tooth when the tooth that needed filling was on the other side. That same tooth right now a week later hurts to touch it. i also got my wisdom teeth taken out here. My complaint on it is the sedation. I was told sedation wasn't covered by my insurance but they recommend I be sedated because the teeth were close to a nerve so i paid for it After extraction I contacted my insurance because I didn't understand why it didnt cover it, the insurance lady told me it was something that could have been covered by what I explained that it was recommended for this and this reason and Western Dental could have sent out something to them for approval. I could go on with my experience with Western Dental but these two experiences is at the top. I am done with Western Dental. I will no longer come here nor recommend anyone else come here. I gave them a few chances and they let me down.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1618872993327, 'text': "We're very sorry that you had a negative experience.

Waited for a long time for an our appointment. I didnt complain. On there website and on every wall inside this place states that it is 99$ a month with 0$ down for braces but when we got in there they stated it was only for certain circumstances and wanted 1000$ down and 200$ a month. Thats false advertising and will take my business elsewhere.< /review>

<review>I had a very good experience going to Western Dental today. I had multiple teeth pulled today and I was not put to sleep so, I was very nervous about the pain level....... To my surprise the dentist must have been the best because I didn't experience the pressure or the nerve pain. I think it's all about who you get for a Dentist......< /review>< pictures>

Watch out for Mary, she’s the one that does your contract.  She will talk a big game but when you sign that contract it’s over with, she’ll sale you a dream but only make your appointments for what’s covered on insurance, then push everything else to the back of priority. I experienced getting the wrong tooth pulled and they still don’t have any remorse. She also knows how to work the insurance system so you think you’re paying for something your insurance doesn’t cover when really it does. You’ll waste time and money..</text>

<Review>Have called over and over no one answers. Had 16 teeth pulled for implants to be done. Right before covid started. No one has reached out to me to see how I'm doing or nothing 2mo. Later had to cut and pull my own stitches. Still no one has reached out to me. You would think they would send me too a office that is open. I even emailed the main site and still no one has reached out. My experience before this was great with Mary who was helping me. This is costing me over 18,000 dollars but yet they still taking my money but no help.</Review>< pics>

I’ve heard of Western Dental for a long time and didn’t really cared for it...until yesterday. First, the receptionists: Kendra and “V” greeted me with pleasant smiles. My X-rays were done by Ilsy. She is excellent! I didn’t even gag and she was quick, too! After the X-rays was done I was seated.
A Dentist comes in and greets me.
That was quick! His name is Dr Patel. He did a very thorough examination and showed me what concerns he has for my teeth. I was worried about having cavities, but he assured me I was doing great on my part and that he’ll keep a watch for my teeth. No needle necessary! (whew) The Patient Specialist is Christina. She informed me my insurance covers my check-up and cleaning that day. “Everything is covered” she said pleasantly. (I like her) After signing the consents I was moved to the treatment room where an awesome Hygienist name Alexia performed the best cleaning for my teeth, ever. She greets me, then leans me back and lifts the chair upwards. “Will the Sonic Cleaner hurt?” I asked. She said that it’s water-operated and I shouldn’t feel any discomfort. She gently cleaned my teeth very thoroughly. Then the polishing. After a nice floss and rinse my teeth felt different. They felt lighter, less tightened more refreshed and super glossy smooth. I’m a believer now. On my way out the rest of the staff said their hello’s and some goodbyes. Especially the one with the cool glasses with the awesome looking hair. The receptionist Kendra had a Recall appointment already set up for me in six months.
I must say, it’s a long time but I can’t wait to come back because I’m really liking this place.<//Text>

<Text>Most unprofessional dentist office I've ever dealt with in my life. Today is the 2nd time that they have not honored an appointment made through their customer service.

1st time, they said that I was not on their calendar. The receptionist insisted that they don't have me on their system. After a few minutes, someone from the inside counter said that I was on their system. They have to move my appointment because they were overbooked.

2nd time today! I was again informed that they cannot take me because they weren't able to leave a message on my voicemail to confirm my appointment. They could have easily eMailed or even texted me.

On both occasions, I received an eMail reminder. They said that they didn't send it. The eMails were from their corporate office the receptionist said.

Why in heaven's name are their corporate office not in sync with their office on 5756 Pacific Avenue, Stockton, CA 95207.

PLEASE DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR. AVOID GOING TO WESTERN DENTAL OFFICE ON PACIFIC AVENUE BY ALL MEANS. YOU HAVE BEEN FOREWARNED.

SPREAD MY WARNING!

P.S. the dental technicians are all very professional. They always take care of you and want the best experience for you to have.<//Text><name>Tony, Jr. Catral<//name></record></dataset><record>

Today the Western Dental staff really helped my son & I. Mary went above and beyond in helping to find our best and most affordable option in moving forward with this.
The Dr. was very patient and helped us decide the best route for my son. We are grateful for all of the help in figuring out the best plan.
Thank You Western Dental Staff!

This staff does a great job keeping a positive demeanor with what seems to be an overbooked system.<//text>

<Review>OK, I would have given them 5 stars. However when they tell you your appointment is at 9:00 AM, they must respect that particular time.
They do get 4 stars thanks to two ladies.
1. Mary Reyes, a kind, understanding, compassionate and super helpful LADY, who explained everything in detail with tons of patience and was sympathetic and understanding for my concerns.
2. Alexia, the dental hygienist who put me through hell and back (just a joke) while doing deep teeth cleaning. She was patient and understanding.
Guys you MUST respect appointment times, that you yourself give to us patients. Otherwise your rating will slip down and you may get lower ratings. You can do it, with just a little effort.</Review>< pictures>

Extremely deceptive pricing.  Work was ok at first and we paid in full. Then their brackets started falling off.  They tried to charge us $55 per bracket.  I live on a fixed income and have helped many children get braces.  We were never charged extra due to the faulty installation of a dentist.  I am fighting this.  This is a predatory pricing practice.<//Review>

<Review>Mary is the best person that works there.. I almost didnt got there because of Maria she was so rude to me on the phone and all I was asking for was information on sedation...but when I talked to Mary she made me feel like I mattered...she worked with me and I was going to go to a different dental office if it wasn't for her..but I'm glad I did the people that worked on me the doctor the specialist everyone was great that day.. I only gave it 4 starts because of Maria but Mary is Amazing< /Review>< user>

Their receptionist's are very friendly esp. Idalia. I'm scared of dentists and she talked and laughed with me before my appointment. So far ALL of the DR's have been great with me and my fears. Dr. Patel was absolutely wonderful and I can honesty say he did NOT hurt me during any of my visits! Even the way he did the shots hurt less👍😀.
The only problem I've had was thinking they were doing one procedure and it was something else so I had to come in a couple times to get all my fillings instead of once. But since staff was nice it wasn't a big a deal.<//Text>

My personal experience at this Smile care location has been very pleasant. They have very friendly staff. My hygienist does a wonderful job while working on my teeth, she's every gentle and polite. The smile care manager is well organized, very professional, bilingual, and easy to communicate. In general very helpful. I enjoy coming to this location. How though they do need an upgrade on the location but other than that it's great.

Update from previous post: I would like to mention now that I change my opinion about this place. They have upgraded which is a plus but the service is poor! They have you waiting for hours and hours and have your whole day wasted. They are never on time. I waiting literally an hour and half before they called me in to wait another hour and so.... Stop over scheduling patients if you guys don’t have enough staff to handle your patients! Take care of your patients first. I will definitely look into another place.<//review>

There are several locations near me. I started going to this one about 3 months ago. The first Doctor I saw was Dr. Singh I really liked her unlike many dentists I've seen she got right to the bottom line. Next I got to see the oral surgeon Dr. Atwal this guy is a gem I had so many reservations about the procedure, but he calmed me down and helped me through it and got the job done. I REALLY liked this doctor again he is a gem. Today I saw Dr. Sami another awesome doctor, a really good man. There was a doctor in between sadly I don't recall his name. The ENTIRE staff here is really really good from the front desk to all the assistants in the back. Really recommend this location if you're uneasy about seeing the dentist.< /Review>

<date>1572918576081</date><text>I came here to have my wisdom teeth removed and after 2 weeks I still wish I wouldn’t have. It was 2000$ to be put under anesthesia.

The day before I went in to be put under they asked me not to eat anything or take my medication. When I was put under I could still here the doctors talking and didn’t know why I was partly awake. I could hear them ripping out all four teeth.

When my body woke up they told my mom my blood sugar had dropped and I needed to eat something.     ( immediately after surgery). With my mouth still bleeding.

I went home to sleep and had a seizure when I woke up( I don’t any history of them).They forgot to give me the mouth wash when I left and I didn’t get it until calling and asking them about it 3 days after surgery. All they gave me for pain was Tylenol and ibuprofen.

After two weeks one side healed while the other is still a gaping hole. No one ever called to follow up and I’m still unsure on what happened.

If you can go anywhere else to get surgery please do it.</text><Response>{'time': 1573072090231, 'text': 'Loren, we would like to know more about your review and we urge you to speak with us directly for additional support at (855) 779-7678 or if you prefer, please send us an email at socialmedia@westerndental.com we want to be sure to address this issue for you.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

Very friendly, communicative, experienced and knowledgeable, answered all my questions. Paula (hygienist) was also very gentle on my deep cleaning it’s been a while since I’ve been to the dentist so I had sensitivity. Overall experience was great.<//Review>

I wish I could give them a 0 overall, since February I’ve got through my x rays & exams with this office, however, getting cleaning and fillings and tooth extraction, has not been accomplish as planned. I have literally been running back and forth trying get through one procedure. It should never be so much of a hassle to get through a procedure and they still haven’t done the work. Nowadays it’s all about money and not even considering your patients needs fully. All they wanted is to get you medicated if your blood pressure was high with ridiculous side affects prescription drugs from pharmacist. I hope another western dental office does a lot better with their patients instead this office.< /Review>

I am very unhappy with the rude service I had here. The front desk rep was not helpful at all. The rep was rude, opinionated and arrogant. When I arrived to my daughters visit she asked what I was being seeing for. I respectfully replied that my daughter had a wisdom tooth that was affecting her speech and she began having other symptoms as well as Bell’s palsy due to this issue. The front desk rep relied well what do you want use to do about that with a very arrogant attitude. I replied to the rep “I would like for my daughter to see a dentist so he could advise how to move forward on this problem.” She stated that nothing could be done and that it’s best I look for another self paying place to address the issue. I am just in disbelief with this clinic. I do not recommend this dental clinic at all l.</Review>

He was friendly and very professional. The whole experience wasnt a bad one seeing that I hate the dentist office.<//review>< pics>

My experience was not so great, they didn't listen to my request, they just want to contract you into a huge bill with astronomical finance charges, .. Money is the game there.. Not to mention, the Dr.s argue over proceedures, in there native tongue, not thinking, that possibly you my understand exactly what they're discussing... Walked out not feeling good, 10 days later, still not able to eat soft foods, liquid diet, the runs, weight loss, the stitches still in, just very very unhappy, what a shame,..I gave one star, because of a very nice tech that does care..<//review>

She is the most patient and gentle dentist. Doing my first ever root canal and I had a bad infection; very painful but she kept giving me shots to numb when I felt pain still and she was very calming. Thanks dr😃

Ilsy the dental assistant was very nice and calmed me down when I got scared from doing root canal.
Best people there!! 😀😀

Joanna another dental assistant is very nice and makes you feel comfortable. Thanks<//Text>

<Review>I can't say enough to tell the staff and doctors at SmileCare Stockton -- Thank you!  As a new patient I could not help feeling apprehensive.  I walked in on time and filled out my paperwork and had my x-rays done, thorough exam and consultation with Dr. Kaur (a great dentist) and teeth cleaning, reviewed treatment plan and options and I was out in 90 minutes.

My experience lately has been a bit frustrating. I was getting implants and was at the final stage of crown delivery. At this time ownership of this office changed from Smile Care (Coast Dental) to Western Dental and Orthodontics. The first appointment for the crown delivery in September was postponed because the specialist was not going to be in the office that month (he was only in the office once a month). The appointment at the beginning of October was postponed because that specialist was no longer with the office and another specialist would be delivering the crowns a bit later in the month. Then that appointment was postponed to the day after Thanksgiving because that specialist was not familiar with the system used for my implants. At the November appointment it was discovered that one of the crowns would not seat correctly but since it was the day after Thanksgiving the lab was closed so the specialist could not find out what he needs to do to solve the problem. During this period my stay plate broke. The office was very good about getting the stay plate repaired in a timely manner but at this time there is still no firm date for the delivery of the implant crowns I have paid a significant amount of money for. Gina, Maria, Aya, Dr. Kaur and the rest of the staff are sympathetic and do seem to be doing what they can, but this has been a very frustrating situation. This should have been completed in September.< /text>

<Text>Patricia did a wonderful job with my xrays and was very courteous. My 1 star goes to the service i received from a VERY RUDE dental hygienist who obviously hates her job and has no patience with people. She was so rude i asked for a different hygienist and she stormes out the room. I was left in the room by myself for over 30 mins without anyone coming to ask me if i was OK. I eventually just left and will NEVER return to this location. Please teach your staff customer service stat!!<//Text>< user_name>

<pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><review>Went in and was called 35 mins after my appointment time knowing I had an infant waiting on me to be fed. After X-rays was told I needed a deep cleaning before he even looked in my mouth. Did cleaning the following day 50 minutes late for that appointment. Again knowing I had an infant that breast fed. Only ended up doing half of my mouth due to the extreme amount of pain they caused. I was told to raise hand if need more numbing, I raised hand 6 times and never got the numbing. My mouth had been sore in upper right side in the back now for a week. Taking ibuprofen to help. Next thing I know I closed my mouth with minimal gorse and cracked my back molar and it chipped. I know this is a direct result from the crappy deep cleaning I have received.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>I do not recommend this place because of no professionalism my appointments were cancelled 2 times when I came and had me waiting for 30 minutes before I was told that the doctor wasn't there and they knew the doctor haven't been there since they open at 8:00am in the morning wasting my time then I came another time they had me sitting in the office for over an hour waiting for the dentist to get off of lunch when they should have scheduled me to have my appointment after the break was over poor service won't go back again.

< Review>
I made an appointment over a week ago and when I went in today for my appointment. They had my name and birthday wrong and I had to reschedule. I will come here for my cleaning but not for anything else because they are unprofessional. I had been on the phone with a guy for 10 minutes asking about my insurance and then to make me and appointment spelling everything and telling the man my birthday. EVEN GIVING HIM MY INSURANCE NUMBER AND SSN. But he can't figure out how to spell me name when he seen it?
Update: I went here after not making one or two appointments but 3 appointments and they finally saw me. But I had to wait 2 hours to even be seen When I had an appointment? I'm not going to return here. They wanted my time I thought I was getting a cleaning and all they did was check my teeth and take xrays. I'm honestly love the people but i'm not going to be waiting 3 hours on a place when I have an appointment.< /Review>

<Review>KARLA is so amazing she made sure everything was okay, and appointments were taken care of, she’s so professional and sweet. MARIA was very helpful, she made sure my appointments fit my schedule, and also got me in right away when she knew I was in pain. KENDRA is also a great receptionist and made sure my appointments fit my schedule, she is very sweet, caring, and professional. ILSY is so sweet and caring, she knew I was scared and held my hand the whole time! She makes my day when I see her. DR. KAUR was also so sweet and caring, she went above and beyond while doing my root canals. TERESA is super nice, sweet and great with scheduling as well as making payment arrangements. MARCO is amazing! He was so caring when it came to my financials, and really worked with my budget. I just felt so comfortable all around when talking to him. DR. ATWAL and his assistant JENNY are very nice. They did 4 extractions and 4 bone grafts, they were so gentle, comforting, and made sure I was in no pain. DR. ATWAL and JENNY were also so patient with me and caring during the procedure. CARLOS is great and SUPER QUICK at taking xrays, and great at making me feel comfortable. PATRICIA P. is also so sweet and helpful and helped get me all set up and comfortable, the hygienist Hussain is amazing and made me feel so comfortable and did an amazing job. All around it’s a wonderful caring experience. EVERY PERSON THERE, TREATED ME GREAT, EVERY ONE I MENTIONED ABOVE, ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO, AND ARE VERY PROFESSIONAL MAKING ME WAY LESS SCARED and A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE!< /Review><Name>Stephanie Horton<//Name>< Pictures>

I was wonderfully greeted by carla at the front desk. I was taken back by Gina to take some x-rays and then was examined by Dr. P. After the exam he explained what procedures were necessary to accurately diagnose everything. I then spoke with Liz about what was covered and what my expense was, after I  received treatment deep cleaning by the wonderful and gentle Dr. Wu and his assistant aya. Then ilyse took my mouth impression. After that I then had two extractions with Dr. Wu and Gina assisting him. I had a splendid experience with all the staff i encountered.<//Review>

Honestly, I have been with SmileCare since I was a kid. I really do love how they treat me and treat my teeth. I don't let myself go easy when it comes to my teeth but at this dental office,I feel safe with them touching my teeth.  Even though I moved to San Jose,I still come back  to see my hygienist Pheap every six months. She is very caring and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Pheap for your cleaning.</Text>

What do You want Me to talk to You about. I posted My review or My Thought about My experience at Your Establishment whether I was the Patient or Not. You didn't like what I said or posted on the review. You frantically asked & assumed it was My daughter's review to take it down. I am sure if You had a Bad experience or Not so Great experience You would post what You felt & thought of Your experience. And I don't think You would even take it down... You shouldn't expect a 5 Star from every1.</Review>

Absolutely horrifying, Late 2 minutes to an appointment? Get rescheduled 3 weeks later. Show up on time? Oh you gotta wait 30 minutes because the tool is unavailable? The receptionist is a piece of work, she can't handle a simple conversation without hanging up the phone on you! RUDE! I DIDNT SPEND $4000 FOR UNFORGIVABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//Text>

<review>My name is latoya S. I had a appt with the office. I wasnt able to get work done. And i was upset about wisdom teeth in my mouth that was very frustrating the staff was understanding even tho i was mad. Maria came in and talk to me and resolved the problem no matter How upset i was. She. Was able to get me seen and she explain that they have to follow procedures the right way. She got my x rays ordered. Gina did my xrays very nice lady. She understood my pain. Maria was very good explaining what would be done overall my first timw visiting with the office and i recomend anyone here. Dr.P was very good about examing my x rays and letting me kno what needs to be done and that its important to do so. Very great staff. Thank u all. The receptionist as well good job.< /review>< rate>

Catalyna and Dr. Rohan Pathak was awesome. I have always had anxiety going to the dentist, but Catalyna made me feel calm and relaxed. I had four root canals and a crown by Dr Pathak. The procedure was fast and pain free. Now I can go about my days without any pain. Thank you Dr Pathak, you are truely one of the best doctor out there.<//Review>

I hate to say this this place is very unprofessional I don't even know the lady's name that I spoke to. I asked if she took denti-cal the response was yes so I proceeded to tell her I need to have some oral surgery done which is removal of the Tori Mandibular left and tori Mandibular right and Mandibular right Protuberance near retromolar pad. So very rude she cut me off told me they could not do it there that I needed to go to a hospital setting because there is not an oral surgeon there. As I tried to explain to her my insurance is giving me authorization to have the surgery she told me no I do not and I said oh yes I do it's right here in writing she told me the insurance company could not give me an authorization they had to do it themselves funny thing is I have an appointment to go to Smile Care in Sacramento I was just trying to get closer to home which would have been Stockton LOL. Place is a joke need to be more professional. If they don't like their job they need to get out find a new one that is not how you work with the public especially in that line of work. JstSayN! To the owner of Smile Care shame on you you should see what you have working up front no comment coming from you is going to make a difference today!<//review>

Today was my 2 yr old daughter's first check up & I must say it went really good!!! I thought I would be there hours but I was in and out thanks to  Erica Samol, who was awesome, very nice, patient and just wonderful with my daughter. Erica answered all of my questions & did a wonderful job at making my daughter feel comfortable.She even got her to take x-rays:). I highly recommend Erica Samol & Dr. Nayak who also was great & gave me great info on keeping my daughters teeth in good health !< /text>

Don't let all these other reviews fool you. This dentistry is ridiculous, I'm speaking to the people who plan on getting braces and are considering this place. Don't waste $4000 on a company who doesn't care about who you are. All they want is to take your money. I have braces from this place, and the year I have known these people has given me nothing but stress. Nobody tells you want the hell is going on with your teeth and the people there especially the receptionists don't give a crap about who you are. This place is not professional at all. It seems that they hire people that don't know how to even do there job.
The orthodontists there don't tell you anything about when your going to get your braces off or what they are doing to your teeth. You would expect they know what they are doing, but of course they don't. There will be times when they have to converse with each other to figure out what they are doing. That seems unprofessional. They prolong your plan to make money by hoping you break something or( in my case) piss you of enough to make you transfer to another dentistry which is what I plan to do. I could keep writing but I have to find a dentistry that actually cares< /review>

(Translated by Google) My 4-year-old girl had an appointment at 9am and they attended us until 11:15, that was too long of a wait, that's why I do not recommend it, they do not attend you at the time of your appointment, it was desperate and more for my girl

< Review>
The older gentleman greeter at the door was the nicest greeter I have had the pleasure of meeting in the past 6 months! You hear people say all the time have a good day thanks for coming and things of that nature and you know it's just force of habit for them to say when this guy says it's good to see you, you can tell he really means it, even though he's never seen you before in his life!
He made my day<//Review>

Went to Costco today (2021-04-01) after 6:00pm. The store was rather quiet compared to typical. The store was well stocked! I even found my favorite Chocolate Covered Dried Mangos! Haven't found them for a couple years... Overall a good day at Costco.< /text>

Costco was very pleasant for a Saturday.  It wasn't crowded and the return line was very fast.. after shopping we did not have to wait for a cashier.  I was thinking it was going to be a nightmare but turned out to be a quick visit.</Text>

Costco is our consistent favorite for lots of stuff. The produce is good and the stores are generally clean and well maintained. We especially love the self check option because we get through so quickly!</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Terrible experience. The staff tried to upsell me the executive membership three times. The third time another employee said I still didn't understand and also tried to upsell to me. I had to raise my voice and tell them to stop upselling or I would walk out the door. That should have been a sign for me to leave but I decided to see what they were selling and what the prices were. I walked through the entire store and did not find a single product that was a good enough deal that it would warrant paying $50 a year for a membership. You can find similar or better deals at other stores, e.g. Target, Trader Joe's, Sprouts and Smart & Final. You just have to figure out what is cheapest where. I immediately cancelled my membership for a refund and I got bad attitude from the staff. That made sure I will never be back and won't recommend them to anyone.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Because, I was with family, lots fun. Of course store was clean. Our cashier was funny as heck, he couldn't get my brother-in-law attention, i called out his name, he didn't 👂🏽me, cashier hollered "Michael" which got his attention, I was almost crying i was laughing so hard.

Cause Michael didn't know weather to be mad or not but because I was laughing so hard he had to laugh himself. i also feel as though people should bring their own wipes  shouldn't count on store to have them<//Text>< pictures>

From daily salad to electronics and gas, costco fundamentally reprogrammed my daily routine, health, and finance, to my liking. Yes, inconvenience and adaptations and friending freezer may be required, but the benefits afterwards way outweigh the initial inconvenience.<//Text>

The store is well managed, clean, but the doors are too small comparing with other Costco like the one on Coleman in San Jose. The air does not vent very well or fresh.

I can't believe costco is making us go to the warehouse to cash our reward checks!! We are in the middle of a pandemic, my god, what don't they understand? We need to stay home whenever possible and costco is making us go out to the warehouse? I NEED that money!! I can't wait months to cash this check. This is money I earned!!!!!  I will be NOT be using the Citibank card from now on.   The CEOs at Citibank and Costco earn millions, they don't need every penny I work so hard for.  THIS is WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

<Review>Costco has great quality products at great prices. I came tonight at 7:45 and it was pretty empty. This Costco's staff seems nicer than the ones at my usual Costco, Sunnyvale. When things are on sale at Costco, you have to stock up!< /Review>< pics>

<Time>1537424108781</Time><rating>4</rating><review>One of the best place to go grocery shopping . Prices are the best as compared to the market rate. Though many a times you have to buy more than the required amount of the product , since its a whole sale market . I love the bouquet and the chocolate section the most. The frozen chicken and fish are also of good quality here .<//review>< Pics>

Costco has great products. The Kirkland brand is excellent. Costco has a good local wine selection at fair prices so you can try different wines. I love the fresh baby lettuce and variety pack of colorful tomatoes. We often add a Costco cheese, their olives, pickled beets, or other things and it makes a healthy lunch. They have many organic products so you don't have to worry about GMOs.< /Text>

However I was wrong. After speaking with Costco corporate, I learned that individual warehouses can set up their own return policies. This particular warehouse has a reasonable policy on non-perishables, but the way it  was implemented left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I have had plenty of good experiences here at this particular warehouse. All I'd like to do is to point out what happened recently to bring visibility to frequent shoppers at this location because the responsibility will most likely be on you, not on Costco.

I recently purchased a large pack of non-perishables and I never opened it. When I tried to return the unopened non-perishables, the customer service member said that Costco can't accept the return because it's already expired. Sure. I agree I shouldn't return expired products, BUT I bought them in October of 2020, and I tried to return them at the beginning of December 2020, which is just a little over one month after.

I'm not disagreeing with this policy. It's completely logical to not accept foods, non-perishables, and produce that passed the expiration date. Sure! It's just a few dollars, who cares? However, two things in particular are worth calling out here.

1). This particular warehouse NEVER mentioned anything like this in WRITING around the warehouse, so the customers can know about this policy prior to purchasing any food, perishable, and produce. No such policy is given on the CORPORATE website either. Where's the transparency? Now, most people will say use some brain. Common sense dictates that you shouldn't return expired product. I agree. But this can apply to any policy the warehouse creates and on any product you buy. It's about COMMUNICATION and TRANSPARENCY.

2). The second call out is pretty straightforward, but it boggles my mind: why would you sell non-perishables that expire in a month!? I would think common sense dictates most if not all perishables should last more than a month. Especially considering the things customers buy from Costcos are often in large quantities.

To reiterate, I think it's one thing to have your own policy, but please let customers know about it well before purchasing something from your store, not mentioning that you sell non-perishables in large quantities that only have short shelf lives of one month. We're all in this together. Just be honest and transparent about your rules.

Please improve your customer's purchasing and return experience. Thanks.< /Review><Date>1607145777371< /Date>< pictures>

My family and I prefer to go to Redwood city primarily because of customer service n more variety. We had a bad experience in mountain view with a cashier who treated us poorly. Management didn't help much either. But I go here if Im in the area and need something asap. But I try my best to avoid it.< /review>< pictures>

Went here to get my membership verified since it didn't work online when I tried. That didn't work.
Called the phone number at 5:50pm and had the system send me around literally in circles, then by the time it connected me it was exactly 6:00pm, so realistically they should have been open despite stopping me in my tracks for 10 minutes, but in fact they closed 1m early. Come on.

First off why isn't the verification working online or in person. Second off don't send me in circles on your call system.

Typically is fine here otherwise. Nothing to write home about.<//Review>

Smaller warehouse but has the right selection that caters to my needs.  Also customer service here is much better others in the area. Parking is also not an issue here unlike Sunnyvale or San Jose.</Text>

Costco wholesale is the one of the biggest whole sale. It has variety of products also you will get good chocolates over there . You will need the members ship card then only you can buy the product. If not then find some one who can buy on your behalf. This is really big place to go for shopping.<//text>

They run a tight ship over there. Even during covid. I do however miss the combination pizza in the food court and of course all of the samples that they had to stop doing due to covid regulations. I won't fault them for that haha. But that was always a favorite while shopping with my grandma as a kid, so i'll definitely be first in line when they resume lol<//text>

Costco clearly takes Covid-19 safety seriously. They keep it clean and everyone wears a mask. It's also great they always have paper towels and toilet paper.</review>

I love Costco.  Spend most of my money.  The ribs...are so deliciously seasoned you don't need sauce. They are great for left overs...and goes well with your favorite cool/cold drank!!!  The quinoa salad...the perfect blend of goodness.  Healthy and favorable does exist. Who knew!!!   I love this Costco for many reasons and this weekend I found one more reason to keep going back.</Text>

Easily accessible from 101 with ample parking. The layout is good with the usual product assortment.  Only missing element is a gas station else it would be perfect. Has additional store around so one can get multiple errands completed easily in a trip.< /Text>

This Costco store is the closest to our home and I've been there probably hundreds of times. Bought from them everything from food to computers to furniture, sun glasses to down jackets.  Some of these items came at unbeatable prices. Their selection changes with seasons and is always timely.  Stores sometimes carry items not available online or in other stores. They also have a very generous return policy.<//Text>

It's a smaller Costco. There is no gas station but that also means it's less busy than some others (that is relative as Costco is always busy). Staff are friendly. Layout is pretty straightforward.  There aren't many nooks and crannies (which I like as I am less likely to miss something I want). The customers are also usually more polite that at some other Costco's I have been to.<//text>

<Text>Location is great, service is also very good especially optical department. Not crowded which is nice. But this Costco is low in stock and not many varieties of products are available e.g. rice. Also, this one doesn't have a gas station.</Text>< Pics>

It’s a good Costco, not too busy if you go on week day. There’s a gas station. You must be wearing mask and they still have to check your receipt cause that’s a thing people do lol there are social distancing guidelines installed. The produce here isn’t as good as other Costco.<//review>

Its Costco. Have to be patient. Always busy with people and cars. Parking is difficult to find most of the time because it's a shopping center with many businesses.  Staff is helpful. Cleanliness is on point.  This is my favorite Costco in the bay area. Shop and enjoy!< /text>

An average non-gasoline Costco. I _wish_ the google maps directions would direct me to the entrance on Leghorn behind McDonalds (this seems like a maps issue but I only really care about it when I go there and realize, every single time, that the entrance next to In-N-Out is absolutely horrible compared to the one on Leghorn)<//Text>

<Review>Speedy and courtesy experience of replacing a defective car battery. The sales person, Kao S. knows what he is doing and completed the whole transaction less than 10 mins. No waiting time. Highly recommended to buy car battery from Costco.<//Review>< user>

<Review>Place is very busy during weekends. Finding parking will be challenging. Specially most of the parking aisle are one way, you may get stuck behind a car waiting for someone to load up and leave. Otherwise great place to buy stuff in bulk. Place is clean and items nicely arranged.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
as far as I am concerned, this costco is better than Sunnyvale - finding parking is easier, it is better arranged, usually less crowded and the food court is inside the store.
keep in mind that there is no Costco Gasoline here.<//Review>

<text>This Costco is one of the few in the Bay area with the shortest lines. Sometimes the employees are a little unprofessional, but they try to help. Anyway, fastest Costco in the West.</text><userid>101641704687957016831</userid><Name>Steven Baron< /Name>< Pics>

I was eating my delicious strawberry sundae from costco and all of a sudden that delicious flavor turned to a nasty flavor like plastic, like old peace of bread.

<Review>Besides not having the Costco Gasoline in the premise, I think this location IS complete! They now have the self-checkout lanes can you believe that? I was in it for just four items and I got out within approx. ten minutes of wait in the check out line (normally would take 20+) on a Saturday at 12pm! It's great!</Review>< pictures>

<text>Went there today to get my long-lost membership card after renewing my Costco membership online. The greeter helpfully pointed out the membership counter, which quickly and efficiently found my membership, took my photo and printed a new card for me, all in a few minutes. Didn't have much time, but I did wander around the store a little and saw that they seems to be well stocked on electronics, clothing and seasonal items, somewhat more so than other Costcos I've been to recently.<//text><Rating>5</Rating><response>None<//response><userid>112017023214808729251<//userid>< Gmap_id>

At checkout, there is excessive and unnecessary touching of items by gloved store employees.  The checkout staff and their assistants, are likely moving contaminates between and among customers as they touch and handle every item.  (Have you ever seen an employee take the time to wash their gloves between each and every customer?)

Instead, please train checkout staff to use the touch-free hand scanner.  (Especially when a shopper goes to the trouble to place all item barcodes face up and ready to be scanned.)  This is not only safer, it is more efficient.  A proficient cashier, can take less than a second per item.

Look forward to seeing this implemented in Costco new employee training.

---
ps.  Glad to see the fire zone has been cleared out of demo cars and delivery trucks.  Thanks also for retraining the tire shop managers to focus on the best interest of the customer (and discouraging any poor habits developed from less honorable practices).<//Review><time>1596497393978</time><Rating>3< /Rating>< name>

Got one sample of each -the products have turned out to be classy stuff at bargain prices. Got Samsonite luggage set at good discounts. Also branded bluetooth headsets at good prices. We got a range of dry fruits and liqueur filled chocolates. I live in India and when i visit the bay area i make it a point to visit this treasure house of bargains before returning home. It is real pleasure shopping at Costco because of the variety, quality and prices of products.  This superstore is an iconic American institution. Hats-off to its concept.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>Went there today to get my long-lost membership card after renewing my Costco membership online. The greeter helpfully pointed out the membership counter, which quickly and efficiently found my membership, took my photo and printed a new card for me, all in a few minutes. Didn't have much time, but I did wander around the store a little and saw that they seems to be well stocked on electronics, clothing and seasonal items, somewhat more so than other Costcos I've been to recently.</Text>< response>

We go to this Costco at least once a week. This is the least crowded Costco store in the area since there is no Gas station!

Costco is the synonym of high quality and good service. Love this store.

My kids love their hotdogs and chicken bakes. Hope they can keep them forever.< /Text>

Lots of other restaurants and stores in the same shopping center make this a convenient place to go. Usually busy, and parking can be a pain, but the lines go quickly.<//text>

<review>The worst service I’ve ever seen. They won’t do anything helpful. They make excuses all the time as claiming they don’t have proper tools, and send you to your dealership. In what earth a tire center cannot have tools to remove regular lug nuts! Don’t even waste your time coming to this ‘tire center’!< /review>< gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Costco is a well-run company and I think that this particular Costco is a good one. I appreciate that they have organic fresh fruit and vegetables. Their prices cannot be beat. I don't usually shop on a Saturday because the crowds are a little larger but at 2:00 I was in and out of Costco in record time. All in all, I think you cannot go wrong with Costco.< /review>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><Review>Costco is back to being convenient.  No waiting to get in, they have milk, eggs, toilet paper, paper towels, fresh fruit, etc.  No limit per customer.  Seems like they've basically fixed their covid-19 supply chain problems.  I don't think I saw any disinfectant wipes, but I wasn't looking either.

Checkout line were so short I actually walked straight up to a waiting teller.

I wish they'd get the frozen cherries back, and their Kirkland brand of Nutella was actually better than Nutella and I'd like that back again as well.  I'd also like to see chunky peanut butter that doesn't have sugar added.  They lost all these things last year though, so it's unrelated to the covid-19 thing.< /Review><Rate>4< /Rate><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x808fba0558b2a12f:0xbb457a3972673971<//gmapID><time>1588559492059< /time>< name>

Want Toilet paper and kitchen paper towels? Go to this store at 9am on a non-senior citizen day (so not Tue/Wed/Thur). I reached at 9am on 20th april monday and was able to find both items. Note that they usually start letting people in early (I was inside by 9am or so) even though store timings are from 10am.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Honestly I have never felt discriminated against until a few days ago at this location. I was purchasing some food items and my card kept saying invalid pin . The cashier had kept  accussing me of using someone else's card to purchase my items after I clearly told her it was mine . I told her let me get out of the line while I deal with my card . While I was on the phone dealing with my card she kept giving glaring at me . I finally fixed the issue which wasn't more that a couple of minutes and then she started telling the other customers really rudely "I have to help her because her card was declined" when my card finally went through she then asked me again if I had removed things from the cart ? Like where would I have time to remove things from the cart and where would I even put them ? I told her no and again she gave me a sour look and so she then went to look at the receipt she voided  before to compare the items I purchased . She did this all Before she gave me my receipt for the things I paid for . Like what was I going to do put a box of strawberries down my pants ? Because of this I will not be going to this location ever again .</review>< Pics>

Go with a list and be careful you don’t buy everything in sight but I have never been disappointed by the quality of the seafood and the meat. The produce is getting better and better and the breads, while limited in variety, are a good price. Pick up your laundry supplies, diapers & milk there as well as a new sweater & book to read. But be careful that you don’t end up with the new dinner room table as well!</Text>

It's  Costco... a warehouse store for members, easy to become a member. Good prices, fair selection. This one has problematic parking. Just pick a space, don't cruise for a good one.< /Review>

<Text>How could they be out and not about to restock dish washing gloves for 5+ months??? Disinfectant wipes I get why they are out for 5 months, but dish gloves??? Come on.... Just incompetence in local management. And also I'm sure in general Costco is profiting from the pandemic, since many frequently on sale items are no longer on sale ever, such as TP, swifter cleaning supplies, etc.< /Text>< pics>

I only come here very occasionally, but when you do decide to come, you will find a large selection of electronics, food, probably more toilet paper, everything you may need(excluding some not-so-important things and maybe more).<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This Costco is always crowded.  It's next to HWY 101 close to HWY 85 junction.   So it's a very convenient location.  The only drawback is that they don't have a gas station at this location.   I believe it would create traffic chaos if there were one here.<//text>

<Text>First off, you need a membership card (which has an annual fee) to get access to this wholesale warehouse. If you have a large family, have a big party coming up, or simply like to get some good deals for buying in bulk, then this is the place for you. Costco has a wide variety of products from fresh produce to meats, frozen items, electronics, medicine, and a whole bunch more.</Text><Time>1551751828565< /Time><Gmap_id>0x808fba0558b2a12f:0xbb457a3972673971</Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

<text>It must just be the special people of Palo Alto. People pushing, cutting people off and cutting in line. I love Costco, but this crowd is awful. Good luck finding parking on the weekend. This was my second try at this location and I would rather take the time to drive to any other location.<//text>< pictures>

I do all my grocery shopping at this store. Parking is challenging, but if you are willing to walk, there are open spots further out in the lot. I recommend shopping during the weekday or around 5pm or 6pm in the evenings. Saturdays and Sundays are a zoo and I avoid going if at all possible! I dearly wish this Costco had a gas station, but fortunately it has everything else I need! I've also used the Tire Department for new tires and when a got a flat - they fixed me up no charge (under warranty). Pharmacy and Eye Departments are good too!<//Text>

<review>It's a regular Costco. The parking lot is pretty annoying on weekends when all the minivans (and minivan drivers) come by to restock their supplies. The store is well laid out and you can get in an out fairly quickly. The photo department has a quick turnaround</review><user_name>Leo H<//user_name>< Rating>

Nice place to shop and bop. If you’re hungry be careful shopping...it’s easy to let your wallet sing when you’re here. I’d recommend getting a chicken bake or frozen yogurt before starting your shopping experience. The food court always has fast service as well. As far as the actual store goes, I love their alcohol selection, they have tons of staples too at great value prices and other odds and ends that somehow seem to make sense having in your home. I recently bought a rolling carry on that fits under the seat at Costco, game changer on those cheap basic economy United flights.< /text>

It is a membership-only big box store, that also carries nice  meats, fruits, vegetables, and wine.  If they have an item, it is likely of good quality.  They are quite willing to take something back if you do have a problem, without giving you the third degree.  Items are usually packaged in large quantities, so having storage space at home may be helpful.<//text>

Mid-sized Costco with many aggressive idiots in the parking lot. Great deals on rotisserie chicken, clothes, and gift cards including Peet's.  Friendly staff, and good indoor snack bar. Close to 101, In N Out, and Total Wine.<//Review>

This is my favorite Costco.  Good attitudes, lines are often very short, they are fast at checking and 30 seconds off 101.  Parking is ok...better than most Costco.  Yes, maniacs behind the wheel at every turn, its Costco, but better than most.  Only downside...no gas, alas the 4 stars.< /Text>

<text>I love Costco and go there very (too) frequently. Its a week before Christmas and the chaos is all around us. Was at this Costco in Mountain View today to get a last minute, self created Christmas card printed. It's a regular photo collage and uploaded to get 5x7 prints. This worked out nicely and I was able to pick up the 4 picture (test prints) after 3h. Usually it is 1-2h but that's OK.
Now that my wife and I agreed on one of the pictures, we wanted to order 30 of them. SURPRISE! Pick up possible in 3 days, a regular picture 5x7 30 prints. Could hardly believe it and retried several times - same result. After checking Redwood City Costco and Sunnyvale Costco, both can do it by noon tomorrow, that's 2 days (not hours) faster than Mountain View.
Costco Photo Center in Mountain View is sub par which leads to a 3-star rating while otherwise it would be between 4-5 stars. The other issue - there is no gas station at this Costco which prohibits a 5 star rating (for me).<//text>< pics>

I had to come back and change my review of this Costco due to the manager Frank who has no empathy for first responders, their families or children with handicaps. Frank who said he is the “manger of the whole Mountain View store” was no help and made our lives more difficult for only the reason of power. It’s sad to see how management during this time is in need of a break or rest to recharge and treat their members like members. I’ve never had a bad experience here before until Frank. Costco should do more training for these managers like Frank that are not  equipped or experienced to deal with special cases. I’m sad and disappointed in Costco for allow an experience like this to occur.< /Review>

I went around 530 pm on a Tuesday.  Lines were short.  I really like the self check out option! Staff are friendly.  Yes, you can purchase food items at the self checkout lines.</Text>

As with all Costco locations, this one is stellar. Great staff, superb product, and if you time it right (weekday mornings) you will be treated to short lines and a plethora of friendly staff on the floor to answer your questions. Costco used to be the $200 store. As my income has gone up, it is now the $400 store😁< /text>

COVID update: The well-stocked store has adjusted to the health safety concerns during the COVID-19 situation  but still is overall a good shopping experience. Hopefully this year COVID is properly ended and the classic Costco shopping experience will nicely return better safer and healthier than ever! Which would be pleasant and fun for me  too for the shopping needs of my family and I and especially given the fact I have been a proud and happy long time Costco customer member since my childhood days in Los Angeles and later in the Bay Area / Hawaii. Safety! Health! Hope!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

had a horrible experience. the staff was rude when i showed them the card i had, weren’t willing to help me figure out the issues i had with the card, even though i got tires at the car shop earlier no problem. they said i was “lucky to get my card back”. i was embarrassed in front of many customers, and felt incredibly attacked. not a good way to treat people.<//review>

Like any other Costco, this had everything. Mind that it does not have the gas station on the campus and no garden center inside. I found that the staff here are really courteous. They help customers in aisles and cashiers seem happy. Good Costco among the others I've been to.<//Text>

I'm a huge Costco fan.  Occasionally, you'll get something defective or spoiled, but they have a great return policy. Parking here is a real b!tch, however. As a consolation for bad parking you can wall across the road for some In N Out.</review>

<Review>Senior hours in effect:  M-F, 9:00AM-10:00AM.  I made the mistake of going there when they first opened on 9/16/20, and I was told they have senior hour every weekday.  This isn't posted anywhere.  They do let non-seniors in between 9:30 and 10 if the senior crowd is light.< /Review>< Date>

The Costco itself is awesome. Easy to find parking, nice employees, short lines, self-ordering kiosks for the food court. I did take off a star because the warehouse seemed warmer than other Costcos that I've been to which seemed to affect the produce (many of the fruits were starting to grow mold). The clientele, however, put a little damper on our trip. Many people were not paying attention, leaving carts in the middle of aisles while they wait for samples, stopping mid-stride to look at their phones, you get the idea.</Text>

<Review>No gas station here but you'll always find a parking space even though there are other businesses in the square. The isles here are wide and easy to navigate even with other shoppers. The most crowded area here is in the fruit sections and the outskirts of the frozen food section, often times you'll find carts being jammed. Easy in and out access into this plaza without the backup. I drive 25 minutes to here for the reasons stated above even though there are other Costco's closer by but don't like dealing with the narrow parking spaces and narrow isles.</Review>< Pics>

It's a world of all the items required for a person or entire family for living. You will get everything here in very less price. Only thing is, you have to buy it in bulk. But that is not a problem, quantity is also reasonable. One stop to buy everything.< /Text>

Parking can at times be problematic. The lines for checkout move quickly. The customer service lines can be long and wait time extends to 25- 30ish minutes when you hit Costco rush hour 😆
The store usual has everything in stock that I need.</text>

<Date>1515566150872</Date><review>It’s a Costco. Not as busy as others, which is nice... but there is no shortage of odd people sorting through apples. It’s also worth considering that Costco is rarely a deal over your average supermarket. Having a single choice and everything in bulk makes impulse buying very easy. That’s the Costco strategy. I understand that they pay their employees better than average, which is nice... but I think they are non-union so that probably will lot last.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The Costco itself is awesome. Easy to find parking, nice employees, short lines, self-ordering kiosks for the food court. I did take off a star because the warehouse seemed warmer than other Costcos that I've been to which seemed to affect the produce (many of the fruits were starting to grow mold). The clientele, however, put a little damper on our trip. Many people were not paying attention, leaving carts in the middle of aisles while they wait for samples, stopping mid-stride to look at their phones, you get the idea.<//text>< username>

First, you deal with people so self-centered, that even though there are plentiful parking spaces available, they'll stop all traffic, turn on a blinker, and harass the person in the outgoing car, while holding up all flow of traffic, to get THAT space. STOP DOING THAT. JUST KEEP DRIVING. Then, you get inside, and it's more of the same. Me, me, me... No thought to others, or even the slightest, imperceptible effort to facilitate free flow of others' well-being (like not standing and looking at your phone, with your cart directly in the center of the highway-like lanes). People of Costco are awful. Costco is fine. But is it worth the trip to hell on Earth?<//Text></record>

<Text>Costco at this location has been here forever, probably since early 90s. I remember when membership here was only to selective government employees.  It's probably the smallest Costco in the Bay Area but nonetheless still has great selections. The folks working here are nice with an exception of a few oddballs.<//Text><rate>4< /rate><name>R C< /name>< gmapID>

<date>1574637348297< /date><rate>5</rate><Text>Talk about customer service!  Came in for 5 gallons of peanut oil to do my annual fried turkey (trust me, it blows roast turkey out of the park, and a 16 lb bird takes less than 60 minutes). Waited in return line for 5 mintes first, to try and use my like $17 dollar 2018 rebate, even though I didn't have the printed receipt (that was in my wife's purse, and she wasn't with me). No go....but not a big deal, still have 45 days to use it.  Got the oil ($32 for 5 G - a great price for peanut oil!), some Krave pork jerkey (love it), and some quick meal standbys: Yakatori fried rice packets, Marie Callender chicken pot pies, and the chicken Kiev (delicious with some Near Eastern rice pilaf or cous cous and some roasted brocolli & garlic, or asparagus, or brocollini, or brussel sprouts - an easy & quasi elegant dinner!).

The bill came to $89, but immediately the checker said "you have a cashback that seems to have gone to an old address", and sent a runner to the customer service/returns.  She quickly came back, and my bill was reduced to $46 & change - how great is that?</Text>< Pictures>

This is my local Costco, I go there almost every weekend. It is pretty much a standard Costco with all the usual products and deals. I have found the staff to be polite and efficient. The store floor itself is well organized and clean. It does not have a gas station like some Costco's do. It is also located across from an In-n-Out Burger if the food court does not appeal to you.< /review>

<text>I visited this Costco on Saturday March 2nd. I bought two safflower oil cans and I figured it out that the cashier billed only one can while eating pizza. After finishing my lunch, I went to cashier and showed her extra can and said you billed only one can. Instead of accepting her mistake ,the cashier said I only saw one. I told her they were side by side. I could have carried my cart but by that time my family left to load the car. She didn't even say thank you. She just said to gave her cards to bill the item. I told her I didn't have cards with me and want to return it.</text><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fba0558b2a12f:0xbb457a3972673971</gmap_id><user>106948230337908893812<//user><Date>1552429782000< /Date>< Pictures>

This is by far the best Costco I've been to.

They have a wide array of natural & organic consumables.

The store is easy to navigate.

They are extremely efficient in moving the crowd as the place can get packed to the teeth and the wait in line rarely breaks the 10 minute mark. Unlike many of my local grocery stores that will have ten people in line with only one checker.<//text>

< review>
I find the dog policy interesting. They seem to stop certain people and tell them they can't bring their dog in (even when its contained in a doggie backpack) and then other times they don't stop people even when the dog is on a leash roaming around. I sat and observed for quite a long time while waiting for a friend. In the presence of zero indication of whether the dog was a support animal, the lack of consistent enforcement of the no dog policy was disgusting. Either be consistent and equitable or get rid of your policy. I thought Costco was better than this.< /review>

The isles here are wide and easy to navigate even with other shoppers. The most crowded area here is in the fruit sections and the outskirts of the frozen food section, often times you'll find carts being jammed. Easy in and out access into this plaza without the backup.

<review>Always a miserable experience. No one has situational awareness. Ends are blocked with samples only letting one cart through, then someone always stops in the only gap for samples unaware of the people who want to get through to things beyond that point.  If there is anything I like, it always stops being stocked (except basics like eggs and milk where you can't do much better and they always keep me coming back to this miserable experience so I have enough food to feed my kids without shopping every day).  Good thing I have ten pounds of sugar and four gallons of milk for less than the cost of one of each at another store, but is it really worth it?<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

You have to be blown away by the size of these stores and this is no exception.  The fruit and vegetable options are quite reasonable and the wine is very competitively priced.</text>

This Costco tend to be a little less crowded or hectic compared to the Sunnyvale location, perhaps due to the fact that they don't have a gas station.  I feel this location is bigger and have better selection (for example, poke) but that could be just me.  Costco is always wonderful.< /text>

Love Costco visits. One thing that stood out and differentiated this center from others nearby is that if you order Pizza from the checkout counters after shopping, you have to notify the food court that you have placed the order. Otherwise they start preparing the pizza when you stand in the line and ask for the pizza :) in the food court.< /Review>

This is an awesome place. Every time I come to USA, I visit this place for shopping. It has curated assortment for vitamin supplements, liquor, electronics, chocolates and clothing. Best part they are at price no one can beat. Must visit place. You can check website before coming in to select the items. Remember, you need a costco membership card or come with someone who has it.</Review>

<Review>This is the Costco which we like going to (as opposed to the one in Sunnyvale.). Although the parking lot does get crowded it is somewhat manageable.  Not really the place to go if you're just getting a few things but we only go there maybe a couple of times a month.<//Review></record>

<user_name>Adam McLeod</user_name><Time>1570826368475</Time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Typical Costco product and layout, however the food court area is located inside so the eating area is small and limited, especially if you have alot of kids. I do not usually go to this location because it is far from my home.

The reason for only three stars, is because this particular experience  was really unpleasant due to the guy working the pre-framed art area.  He barked at my wife then made very unprofessional and insulting comments towards her.  Extremely rude. Maybe he was having a bad day, but not acceptable to treat paying customers like that.

Customer experience can make or break a business.  I am now less likely to return to this location next time.<//Review>< pics>

Good assortment of products (Costco localized their merchandising based on local population.) This place appeals to most Valley people's tastes, with excellent prices for generic products, meats, fruits & vegetables, plus a nice assortment of "craft" frozen foods, chocolates and prepared meals.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Good Costco - great selection.  The parking lot is always busy - on a weekday during the day to a weekend when all the moms/families go to Costco.

The good thing is that they let you go into Costco (even without a membership) if you're just going for alcohol. And unlike other locations, they just let you go and pick out your alcohol instead having someone follow you and watch you pick everything out (like the Costco in downtown SF).

Definitely avoid on a Saturday or Sunday.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

It is clean, well maintained, has all of the up to date inventory and the it never feels like I have entered a zoo (a common experience at most Costco's).  My only complaint is that this Costco doesn't have a gas station at it, so I end up having to go to the Sunnyvale Costco which I'm not a huge fan of.

Overall, this Costco is the nicest one in the South Bay.  I highly recommend coming here if you want quality in products and a positive experience where you don't feel pushed and shoved.

Also - the food here is amazing.  I am obsessed with Costco pizza.  If you haven't tried it, you absolutely have to.  You could also pretty much have a full meal just walking around and eating samples... which is also a plus. ;)<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Our go-to Costco, but it often feels really cramped (there are only a few on the Peninsula!). Great, helpful staff, lots of great seasonal items and foods, and a decent wine, beer, and alcohol section. I haven't seen them out of stock of something we have really needed or staple items ever. Moreover, the organic product selection is really strong compared to some other Costco stores we've visited.

Can't complain for a Costco. It's a little small, too busy some times, but still gets the shopping done.<//review>

I want to give this Costco more stars! The checkout lines go quickly, the staff is friendly and helpful. The wine guys always come through with their suggestions and the produce quality is bomb. That said, I can't give it more...the parking situation is absolutely heinous. Guys, it's bad. I recommend going first thing it opens. The return line is often out the door so if you need to do that I also suggest getting there first thing.  There are two other Costcos within reasonable driving which provide an easier flow of traffic an overall management of the high volume of visitors if you find yourself needing to shop during peak hours. Plus, this location does not have gasoline pumps.< /review>

<review>Typical Costco product and layout, however the food court area is located inside so the eating area is small and limited, especially if you have alot of kids. I do not usually go to this location because it is far from my home.

The reason for only three stars, is because this particular experience  was really unpleasant due to the guy working the pre-framed art area.  He barked at my wife then made very unprofessional and insulting comments towards her.  Extremely rude. Maybe he was having a bad day, but not acceptable to treat paying customers like that.

Customer experience can make or break a business.  I am now less likely to return to this location next time.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Costo's printing service are awesome. Firstly, they have the lowest prices. Secondly an awesome customer service.

I uploaded the wrong pics for printing. When I saw the printed pics, I requested Costco to reprint the correct pictures and they agreed to do that. This is what I call a great service.</review><time>1366578530017< /time><user>118109062257871392566<//user></record></dataset><record>

...you can get good deals that don't require the purchase of mass quantities.

There's generally an early afternoon lull even on weekends, so you aren't necessarily stuck with a long checkout line.

Bonus points for astonishingly good pizza-by-slice (recipe from Kirkland, WA.. who'd have guessed) and an unmatched $1.50 dog/drink special (if only the steamed buns matched the quality of the dogs/polish sausage).</text>

<text>I've only been to this location a few times. It's a good Costco. Doesn't feel as packed as the Sunnyvale one , so that's a perk.

It's a Costco like every other, but parking here is extremely tricky. If you go on the weekends or later afternoon on weekdays, plan to spend some time spinning around the lot looking for a spot. No gas station here, closest would be Sunnyvale or Redwood City.</Text>

Costco is a required stop as part of our weekly shopping trips. There are new unique items every week. Samples are a nice touch (you can basically eat lunch with these samples!). Their fish and meat are excellent. Avoid the fruits and veggies though.< /Text>

Costco is always so crowded, it takes forever to find what you need and sometimes you can get worse deals than at Safeway or trader Joe's. If you go, expect at least an hour long trip, but prepare for more, especially on a Saturday.<//text>

I work closeby, this Costco seems a lot more fun. I could smell BBQ and you can see inside the employee lounge is decked out. Everyone there seems bright and knowledge.
Long lines and difficult parking but that's like all Costco. I go there a lot for tires, food and food shopping. It is close to the 101 freeway.<//Review>

This Costco is horrible. I was harassed by a blond haired guy trying to get me to open a credit card. I said no 3 times, when he then asked me what I did for a living. This is was while I was trying to checkout so there was no escape. I almost left my stuff with the cashier and left. It was a bad experience.<//review>

Clothing, baking, photography and other departments have a great discount.  You can take advantage of vegetables in this warehouse if you are more than 4 in the household. Otherwise it will go to waste. Beer and wines prices are regular and they don't carry much selection.< /Review>

Is there anything not to love about Costco? Part of our weekly routine. Good quality products. I skip the produce largely in favor of the Milk Pail. Meat is top quality. They know exactly what I find appealing for impulse buying!< /review>

I love our Sunnyvale Costco. They go out of their way to accommodate. This Costco, the employees just point and grunt. Not the same.</review>

Clothing, baking, photography and other departments have a great discount.  You can take advantage of vegetables in this warehouse if you are more than 4 in the household. Otherwise it will go to waste. Beer and wines prices are regular and they don't carry much selection.< /review>

<text>The parking lot is almost always a nightmare, as are the checkouts--not Costco's fault, this place is just always packed. It's a fairly comprehensive store--great booze selection, and the sample people often have local goods. I definitely prefer the controlled chaos of this location to the utter craziness of the Santa Clara store.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fba0558b2a12f:0xbb457a3972673971<//gmapID></record>

<text>...you can get good deals that don't require the purchase of mass quantities.

There's generally an early afternoon lull even on weekends, so you aren't necessarily stuck with a long checkout line.

Bonus points for astonishingly good pizza-by-slice (recipe from Kirkland, WA.. who'd have guessed) and an unmatched $1.50 dog/drink special (if only the steamed buns matched the quality of the dogs/polish sausage).<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>My preferred Costco to visit even though I live in Cupertino. I get here early at 9am when they open on Saturdays to avoid the crowds. Get in early enjoy the benefits. I used to go to the Lawrence Station location but each time I went it was way to over crowded with people wandering aimlessly stopping and staring off into space. Its the only time in my life Ive ever felt like running through a crowd throwing punches. Anyways.. This Costco rules so much!</Review>< pics>

<text>I have mixed feelings about this Costco. The location is convenient, and parking is slightly more manageable than other Costco's. However, the product offering can be hit-or-miss. Don't bother with getting your tires at the tire center, unless you don't value your time at all.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

It's a Costco, where can you go wrong? Obviously when it's crowded the lines get fairly long, but they are typically good at opening registers when needed. Also, the free food samples are the best!<//Review>

<Text>This is one of the best Costcos in the Bay Area. As you would assume parking is bad but all Costcos have horrible parking...this one is just not as bad as the others.

The customer service inside this place is fantastic. Everyone there is willing to stop what they are doing to help you.

The arrangement of the warehouse is awesome too. Everything is logically placed so your not spending too much time looking for things.

I just wish this place had a gas station and I wish the food court was outside instead of inside.< /Text>< rate>

I like this Costco in Mountain View. Its not as congested as the one in Sunnyvale and since I was only getting a few things, I was in and out in about 45 min. And that's with not knowing where all of the products were!< /Review>

<review>I have mixed feelings about this Costco. The location is convenient, and parking is slightly more manageable than other Costco's. However, the product offering can be hit-or-miss. Don't bother with getting your tires at the tire center, unless you don't value your time at all.<//review>< user>

< Review>
As Costcos go, this is a solid one. There's decent parking, although you might have to drive around a bit. It's well stocked, good selection. The meat section is diverse, with good prices. The produce section is also good, although as with all Costcos, you may need to search through some packages to find the best quality. They sell a nice variety of local products in the food section, including local eggs and milk.  Lineups can be long, but they move quickly. There is no Costco gas at this location, which is a bit of a disappointment.</Review>

What's not to love about Costco? The perks of this one is that it isn't too far from my job, making it easy to purchase things for work. I'd highly re
commend coming to get posters done at the photo center here since they are a lot cheaper than kinko's. Usually takes them under an hour and a half to process orders.

Great wine and liquor selection.< /text>

This particular Costco is my favorite.  Although both the Lawrence Expressway and Almaden in San Jose are closer by distance, this Costco is usually less crowded, easier to find parking and has an indoor cafe with tables inside.  I can always find what I need with much less stress than the other two warehouses mentioned.  There are always plenty of checkers who are helpful and baggers to help me put my items in my bags.  It's worth driving a few miles further to have a stress-free warehouse shopping experience!</Text>

Costco is our "go to" for bulk items and other household staples. Also found great workout clothes and hoodies.  Good purchases and great service at tire center too.</text>

Love their prices, unfortunately they no longer develop film which is a shame.

If they developed 35mm film I would be a constant customer.</text>

Just like any other Costco, you can’t beat it. They just introduced self-serve food stations as well for the food court.

Only negative is this Costco doesn’t have gas.< /Text>

Great for buying stuff in bulk and stocking up. Get frozen organic fruit for smoothies. Skip the fresh fruit as it spoils fast. Resist buying things you don't need.</Review>

Busy, busy, busy! As Costco's go, this is one of the busier Costco's that I've been to. Most Costco's are similar, with long lines, good deals, and an awesome selection of samples, and this one is no exception. Protip if you want to get new tires here: the tire center opens 1 hour before the store opens, and you should arrive (at the very latest) when the tire center opens in order to secure one of the 40-50 slots for tire installation.<//text>

<review>Costco is quintessentially american- it's a big everything store, from tires to groceries. You get everything in big size packs, so beware of shopping there if you live alone. Non perishable items like cleaning detergents etc are generally good to buy from there. Avoid perishables like milk or bread.< /review><user_id>107745182494929172353<//user_id>< user_name>

It is a good place to go and shop but is so busy you can get around but sometimes it is also hard to. Also the parking is terrible you have to drive around a bit to find a decent parking.< /review>

<Review>Great service, clean, has full food court, great location. Shares immediate location with a Starbucks, trader Joe's, produce store, and kis's clothes store. Costco is at the very back of the complex and may be hard to find the first time. Downgraded 1 star due to terrible parking and traffic due to the amount of stores.< /Review>< pics>

Good collection. And must say that #Costco Photo Center is the most #budget friendly place to click passport photos and other printing photo services in #BayArea. They charge only $4.99 for 4 passport photos. Such a #stealofadeal. Love Costco< /Text>

< Review>
Great prices (like all Costco) but a serious traffic jam at nearly every hour, both inside and with parking — which is laid out in a way seemingly so as to create the highest number of potential car-cart/shopper collisions. A redesign for traffic flow would significantly improve the experience.< /Review>

Be prepared to spend a lot of time at this location from finding parking to billing. It's always crowded. The frozen food items are limited and make sure you check Fresh Produce before you buy. Also, customer service is not as good. They asked me a lot of questions and the associate was grumpy when I returned a supplement even when I consumed just 2 pills. This never happened to me back in Denver. I felt Wal-Mart customer care is better than this.<//Review>

I wanted to get myself a rimless pair of glasses and
surprisingly, I found that Costco doesn't work with rimless frames since their machines are not equipped with that.

This sounds bizarre to me to be honest.</Text><resp>None</resp>< time>

Typical Costco! Go earlier in the day, like before 5 for an easy trip. After that on weekdays it gets a little crowded.< /Text>

Good as any Costco. Location is convenient right off the highway, but the parking lot is annoyingly packed  and gets jammed easily.< /Text>

All the stars for Costco products and the store layout. But I had to take off 2 stars for the impolite and unprofessional staff. Especially at the entrance, the lady she stopped my father just to see his costco card where as she let 5 other people go without checking what so ever.....Now, I might be able to excuse her as she might be doing her job but then, she did let 5 other people go...it leaves me wondering....why us?
Highly disappointing behavior..</Text>

I like the layout of the store as everything is pretty easy to find and making sense, such as vegetables, milk, and egg are located at around fresh food section.

I took one star off due to NO costco gas here. In addition to that, it's located right at the exit of highway, which makes this costco very difficult to get in/out.</review>

<text>This rating is for the Opticals which is inside the Costco Wholesale.

I wanted to get myself a rimless pair of glasses and
surprisingly, I found that Costco doesn't work with rimless frames since their machines are not equipped with that.

This sounds bizarre to me to be honest.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Good location and place to pick up what you need. Their organic fruits and veggies are not always fresh. I offend find mold and crushed blueberries or strawberry.< /Review>

<Review>Great deals can be had here, but as just a single guy with a roommate, I often ask myself -- is this worth it?
- Hauling home all the stuff, often in flimsy boxes (or sometimes no boxes at all).
- Storing crazy-oversized stuff in a small'ish home.
- Battling huge crowds, especially on "Family Day" (read: every evening and weekend)

I'm still not sure.  But if you have a *big* purchase to make or a big family, then yeah, Costco is probably worth it.  Doesn't mean I have to actually enjoy it, though :(</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
What is there not to like about Costco? Except that half my cost savings bulk buy of groceries expire before I can eat it all, my super deal on batteries are not all that super after a couple years and the one color of each what ever shirt or shorts on sale eventually find its way to Goodwill unused.< /Review>

<review>One of the staff at the customer service is rude and unhelpful. Every year I had to deal with her and every time her approach was anything but customer service. That one person can ruin your whole experience with the place. Nobody bothers to explain to you your membership status and no one knows how to fix a problem that causes us nit receiving the benefit check.
The sore itself, does not carry many things that they have in their Menke Park place. And they don’t have the same wine experts they have in Menlo Park. If you can go to Menlo Park rather than this place.< /review>< Pics>

I don't know why people complain about the service here. It's better than 80% of American retail stores. Long story short: It's a Costco, there's a reason why people pay to get in.< /text>

No gasoline at this location. The cafe is inside so you need to have your Costco card to access the cafe.< /Review>

An average Costco. However, this Costco has a more traditional floor layout than the Sunnyvale Costco, and this Costco has an indoor food court, whereas the Sunnyvale food court is outside. As always, the tire shop can work on your car as you shop, but it often takes a couple hours (or more).< /text>

I'm not a huge patron of Costco because I don't need industrial size pickles or cheese balls, but shop here monthly to stock up on water and Coca-Cola.  It's usually very busy on Saturdays (sometimes stiflingly so) but if you arrive towards the end of the mid-morning/early-afternoon rush, it's pretty smooth.< /text>

once you've seen one costco, you've pretty much seen them all. nothing too unique about this one other than the fact that there is an in n out across the street so one is faced with the dilemma of choosing between the hot dogs and pizza at costco or waiting to swing by in n out on the way home for a delicious protein style double double with animal style fries and a neopolitan milk shake. the only times i end up opting for the former are when im in a hurry or i've already filled myself up from all the free samples they're giving out.<//review>

The good thing about this Costco is that you get Gasoline here and a large variety of Indian stuff (rice, naan, paneer, wheat/ataa, daals, naan, desserts). The bad thing is that it is always very crowded so takes a while to get in and out or to find parking. Costco still makes up for a remarkable place to go to for quality goods at reasonable prices of you are willing to buy in bulk.<//Text>

<review>Honestly, it does not deserve even one star. Customer service is awful. I spent 30 min in line trying to get membership and end up with nothing. They have the same line for returns and to get membership. If you want to become a member, be ready to waste your time.<//review><gmapID>0x808fba0558b2a12f:0xbb457a3972673971< /gmapID>< user_name>

The customer in front of me courted by customer service and took about 15 minutes having benefits of various Costco plans explained to her.  A rather waste of time at the checkout register area. Don't you think?</Text>

<review>Doesn't seem to carry all the same staples as other Costcos that I have been to. I couldn't find the "good" bacon or Dr. Pepper, both of which are part of why we've kept our Costco membership. Not a great selection of women's clothing either.<//review>< date>

(Translated by Google) This costco is relatively less crowded than nearby costco, and there is also electronic payment for self-checkout, which is very convenient. The dining area is also not outside Costco, so that many people will not eat without cards, which is superb.

(Original)
這間好市多算是相對附近好市多比較不壅擠的一間，還有還有電子付款自助結賬，非常的方便。用餐區也不是在好市多外面，這樣就不會有很多人沒卡來吃東西，超棒。<//review>

(Translated by Google) Everything is very good but bi weird because it is the first kiss that I went to a Costco where the restaurant has it inside, and I learned a lot that day in that costco, no more what I was going to ask but I forgot is that if to buy pizzas or something else in the restaurant is to have the Costco card to enter, or if one can say that he only went to the restaurant, but as he is inside I imagine that if you have to show the Costco card at the entrance.

(Original)
Esta todo muy bien pero bi raro por que es primera bes que boy a una Costco donde el restaurant lo tiene adentro, y aprendi mucho ese dia en esa costco, no mas lo que iba a preguntar pero se me olvido es que si para comprar pizzas o algo mas del restaurant se ocupa tener la tarjeta de la Costco para entrar, o si uno puede desir que solo ba al restaurant, pero como esta adentro me imagino que si se tiene que mostrar en la entrada la targeta de la Costco.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) You can buy goods at a very low cost. However, since there is a large amount of food, a family with a small number of family members may be wasted shopping if they do not purchase properly before buying food.

(Original)
とても低コストで商品を購入することができます。ただ量が多いので家族の人数が少ない家族は食べ物を購入する際はちゃんと考えてから購入しないとかえって無駄な買い物になることもあります。< /Review>
