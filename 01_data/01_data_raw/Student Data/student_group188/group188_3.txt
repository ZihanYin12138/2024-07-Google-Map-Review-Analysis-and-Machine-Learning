<date>1561981774600< /date><text>It's a biblically sound Christian Church like any other one I've been to, and I've been to several. I have to post five stars in that this church not only has the standard extra Sunday school rooms and Nursery, but I know they monitor the nursery staff at a minimum to make sure that more than one person is there at all times. And also the person has to have a good reference before they're allowed to volunteer there. Plus like most churches don't have, certainly at the below mega-church size, they have a Welcome Center and a full coffee shop.  One time when I was having a struggle with being fully conscious and alert, I discovered I left my wallet at home and had to search for my wife to borrow some money. Turned out she was at the end of the coffee counter. And after placing my order and getting my great cup of coffee, the cashier said that's okay, it's at no charge. This one is on me. Honestly, I was moved to almost tears.

Almost forgot. They also have a video camera that recordes the entire church service, not just the sermon. And they both stream it live and recorded on DVDs. So if you can't physically attend the church, you can use any smartphone or computer and watch it live. And you can get a service from a time in the past. Personally I think that's a great value! Singing is a big part of worship, and that's what the coming together of the Saints / believers a. k. a.  church service, is all about. It's for the worshipping God, building each other up in the faith, and supporting each other. And since the recording the entire service, you can also catch the current events and whatever else is shared from the pulpit. When you're a member of a church, you want to stay connected and involved with what is going on. And also to have all the sermons available ( I don't remember how long they keep them for. I'm pretty sure it's at least 3 months.)  Is a blessing because lots of churches do things in a series. Whether it be a topic or a going through the Bible in a sequence. Show a few have to miss one of the services and don't catch the sermon, this gives you another chance to get it.
They have a real love for the people and it shows. I've been to several different Protestant churches during my 30 + years as a Christian. And this church not only does the traditional church services, but they actually make a presence outside their church grounds. At a minimum, every year they attend the cities big annual flower festival parade. And several different volunteers from their Church well walk along the edge of the Parade route and hand out free bottles of filtered water. I know they also shut down the street that their next two, and put on a Halloween festival every year. It's a place that is well-lit, of course the only friendly, lots of free activities for the kids including face painting and making crafts. They have a jumping castle. It's something that my family has been attending for several years and we hadn't attended that church. But that was its main goal. To provide a safe and fun place for all the kids and trick-or-treaters to go to. And at that they excelled!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>5<//rating>< name>

I love our church and its impact on people inside and outside our walls. We are welcoming to all and have the honor of having many active duty military as a part of our congregation. Children and youth are a high priority to us as is their safety. We offer small groups and various classes to help people grow. We have a place for everyone to use their gifts and talents as we Do Church as a Team. For those dealing with various difficulties of life, we offer Life Support and also Person 2 Person support for those who attend. f I was not the pastor here, I would attend here - some of the best people in the region right here at LFC. Thanks for reading my review.<//Text>

< Review>
The food came in minutes band was wonderful. Even though the loud speaker advised not to hang out on the premises after shopping. Due to " covid" It had been several weeks since my dad and I had seen each other and enjoyed catching up while watching all the busy Bodies getting ready to bring in. The new year. Happy New year Bakersfield< /Review>

It s fast food and with this pandemic a line during any of the
Ideal eating times, of course it's going to take some time.
Practice patience, it'll assist on
How well your day goes.

<review>I had a frappe made by Lola and it’s so good!! She was super friendly and busted my drink out quick and with finesse. If Lola is there, you better get a frappe or a milkshake or you’re missing out.</review>< rate>

Always a great experience and friendly staff. Good prices. Never a long wait. Plus my kids love it. So it's a win-win for me. And it won't break the bank like most other spots nowadays.< /Text>

First time trying this Pizza and the Location. Took a bit longer than most Franchise places, however I gotta say - give this place a try! Plus honestly, its a bargain. $21 bucks well spent. La Mexicana Pizza,  Buffalo Wings, Bread Sticks and dipps....</Review>

Pizza was really good grabbed a large pepperoni. Cheese bread was awesome and worth the 10 min wait. I'd call it in first if you can.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>The 🍕 is AMAZING‼️💜💙❤️ even if it cost $50 I'd say it was TOTALLY 😍 worth it! Ironically you can get a large pizza for ONLY $5 👀!! 1️⃣you walk in 2️⃣you order 3️⃣get your pizza 4️⃣you go home... EASY! Even when they've been crazy busy and had no pizzas on stand by I've NEVER waited longer than 5/7 minutes😁. **IMPORTANT🛑 : if you decide to get pizza after 9:00pm EVEN THO 🙄 the hours of operation posted state "open until 10:00pm" they SHOULD mention that; NO ORDERS WILL BE TAKEN AFTER 9:30pm/9:45pm LATEST... SO, to be safe - I recommend being INSIDE the building and ORDER - NO LATER than 9:30pm.👌👍<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd64760e96ee3:0x9a73f3fab1c5b3b0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I said ok. half an hour later after many others got their pizza, I asked when would ours be ready. She checks the warmer, pulls out our pizza and it seems like it's been sitting there. It was coldand when we got home it was hard and tasted terrible. Yuck< /text>< resp>

This is MY local corner store. Good variety of products, can usually find backyard BBQ/picnic essentials great selection of wine for a liquor store and pretty good deals on 750ml of hard alcohol from time to time. Employees have always been friendly. See you soon New Star!< /text>

Great service. Very nice and helpful staff. The diversity of alcohol is crazy, they have almost anything you can think of. If they don’t have what you want, they go the extra mile to get it for you. Pleasure doing service, will return in the future. 5 star service l.<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1606355416228<//Date><Review>Went there to buy a bottle as a gift and feel like I got ripped off badly. The price for Johnny Walker Blue was $229.99 when scanned but they told me the price is actually $269.99.

They tell me this story of “Oh the price changed long time ago and our system screwed up, showing you old time price.”

To get to my friend’s place in time I had no other choice than buying it there even I knew I was getting ripped off. Never going back there.<//Review>< response>

< Review>
They have a very extensive selection of beer and spirits - pretty much unparalleled in the local area. What makes this place stand out from other liquor stores is that they have not only a big variety but many come in different sizes (minatures, hipflasks, small bottles, regular size all the way up to jumbo sized) so you can get the right amount, at the right price point for your budget. They also have a decent wine and snacks selection, and they are open till late everyday.< /Review>

This place was VERY expensive for a liquor store and seemed to specialize e in the higher end items. I paid nearly ten bucks for two sodas, some tums and a candy bar! The people seemed very friendly. In fact, everyone in the store seemed to know kne another (or at least the guy behind the counter) and it almost seemed like a social club...I kinda felt like the odd man out but I held back my tears ubtil I left the store and had a good cry in  my car outside...I was teased as a child and this brought it all back so if you have been through similar traumas as a child I would not recommend this place.

Just to be clean that last part was a joke, I actually found the familiar, friendly atmosphere pretty cool 🥳<//Text>

Very cool place. I don’t smoke but I have occasion to make a run for the hubby. Everyone is so friendly. I don’t even know who the owner is because everyone greats as if they own the place. Super nice and make you feel totally comfortable for someone like me who picks the cigars based on how the box looks.<//review>

< review>
Great little cigar lounge tucked away in the small town of Visalia.  Its one of the few things I look forward to when out in this part of town.

Selection:  Selection is pretty decent here. The last time i was in there was an Kristoff event and the owner made me feel at home.

Pricing is on point.  Little on the high side, but its the CA tax, nothing major here.

Crew that hangs here is very friendly, even had a conversation on religion with a guy (i am not religious.

My one grip is they close  too early.   I get out of work around 5, change and head over.  I am usually not finished with my first smoke by closing time.  The owner is really cool and will let you finish but keep this bad boy open another couple hours and profit.

Nice lounge to get some work done in. Also BYOB which is really nice.</review>

<review>Have always enjoyed going to valley oaks....recently I forgot my golf shoes  at home. And have already been in the market for new ones. I had called when I was in visalia if they had shoes..and s size 10. They did...a great pair of foot Joy's for 69.99....fantastic shoes at a more than competitive price. In fact I was a bit stunned at price. Looking at other golf stores and even online. The valley oaks pro shop saved me time and money!!!! Thanks again</review>< time>

Golf course was great had a good time playing but got stuck before a 5some that was hitting 20 yard drives. Then Marshall was blaming us for holding up the course then told us to jump to another hole. Needless to say I’m very upset on how it was handled and most likely won’t come back.</review>

Fairly well taken care of course with 3 nine hole courses. There are almost always tournaments going on thought the week so check before you plan. Very packed so usually a shower pace of play. Plan on 4+ hours for your round.< /text>

<text>I consider this my home course. 3 different 9 holes to choose from so if your playing 18 you could change it up each round. Greens are in great shape and as well as the fairway.

Wish they would upgrade their driving range or practice area or possibly add a night driving range so golfers can practice late.<//text>< pics>

<review>Absolutely enjoy the Course, always challenging pin placements on the Greens which are in very good condition. I just wish others would repair their Ball Divits, I find myself repairing several on every Green. Still need to add Actual Sand in Traps which would be the icing on the Cake. Other than that Excellent Play...< /review><rate>5<//rate>< user_id>

<review>Can you believe this? On the Oaks 9 they had our group as well as others playing on the Same 9 holes as "Footy Golfers".  I called the pro shop to see if we were on the correct 9. The pro shop said yes we were playing on the correct 9. They said Footy Golfers play at the same pace as regular golfers.
What a joke. Soccer balls everywhere. Screaming yelling. Won't be back Ever !  The first Footy golfer hit by a golf ball will own the Course/City.
Still angry 24 hrs later.
By the way nice Course with very good greens....but who cares!  Oh and we drove off with 3 holes to go.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The greens were in great shape for November. The fairways could have used some work. This is a decent course, but at the high price it does not offer a lot of value.<//Text>

< review>
Course was in very good condition, staff was very helpful (came in for a wedding and needed to rent clubs, no problem with a discount since staying at the Holiday Inn), greens, tee boxes and fairways all in great shape -  bunkers need more sand, but they were all groomed< /review>

Did not like the soccer players on course , they did slow play. Not enough sand in traps , fairways are dry and hard. From Southern Cal and this course for what it is is over priced, 32 dollars for 9 holes. however in this area they have a monopoly.<//Text>

<Text>Very good tire place and very friendly staff here. The tire on my car is very special. They offered very decent tires and offered tire rotation for only 5000 miles. They helped to my breaks too. Very professional and helpful place. I am very happy to choose this place again and very satisfied about their service.</Text><user_name>Yuqi Wu< /user_name>< pics>

Though busy, I was greeted with a friendly welcome by Art who is very courteous and knowledgeable (unlike other tire shops that will make you feel like you are a bother). That alone makes the trip and waiting (there's 3 more cars to be serviced ahead of mine) worthwhile.</review>< Pics>

<review>They were able to get a tire ordered and shipped faster than America's tire. I had a flat, and not only did they get it replaced but they got it replaced faster than anyone else I asked could do it. They even stayed open shortly after closing to finish the work.</review>< user>

Despite being a bit short staffed, John and the guys got me in and out in a couple of hours while my wife and I had a nice leisurely breakfast across the street. The whole experience was great and American Tire Depot got me a good set of tires for a great price with the customer service to match. I will see you guys in 4000k to get my free rotation - THANKS!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>THIS is the type of QUALITY they sell. I bought all 4 brand new tires just a year ago I spent almost $700 from La Cresenta location with the promise I had warranty for 3 years or 70,000 miles whichever was first. I’ve driven only 35,000 miles since then. And this tire popped on the middle of the freeway and almost killed myself. I called and they said they could replace it no problem. I risked driving another hour on the spare so I could get to the San Jose location to get a brand new like I was promised. And guess what? All of the sudden I don’t have a $40 warranty so they can’t change it. And I have to pay for a brand new one for another $150!! What’s the point of spending so much money on brand new tires to get this problem a year later? DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. Worst customer service!<//review>< Pictures>

The gentleman informed us there was going to be a delay as he called a locksmith. I credit the employee for continuing to try to fix the situation while updating and inform us the customers.  The door opened maybe 30min later, not an issues,  tires where in stock and 2hrs later I was contacted to come pick up my vehicle.
Overall there were a couple minor issues with the experience but the staff handled them all and all I walked away satisfied and I’d recommend this location.

<review>If I could give 0 stars I would!!! Went in today for an appointment I had. And had gone on their website and got an out the door total cost quote and scheduled the appointment prior to arriving. I drove about an hour, showed up, and waited almost an hour just to be helped. Finally I get called, and low and behold the quote I had received turned out to be incorrect! And the ACTUAL price was just over $700 instead of $547 which was the total price I was quoted at. They had a buy 3 and get 1 free tire deal on these tires as their website stated and was stated on my quote. They’re telling me that it’s actually not applicable because these tires are “special order” tires. And they said the computer must of messed up with the promotions. So after some back and forth they gave me the promotion but I had to get road hazard warranty for all the tires. But I explained to them that these tires won’t be used on the road only on the track so I wouldn’t need that. He told me that he won’t make any money at that point so he can’t take off the optional warranty!! And I was told that the pricing that they are providing isn’t the same as on the website or the one that was provided by customer service. The manager wasn’t even interested in listening to what I had to say, and I didn’t even get an apology for the “mistake” that their website made. And he was just nonstop stating that he was providing me with the best price, and how much money he’s losing. My overall point was to understand why the quote online after being scheduled and everything is different from the pricing once I’m there in person. Eventually I just decided not to get them. Wasted half a day for me, and about 2 hours of driving just to be lead falsely by their promotions and website. I’m NEVER going back to this shop nor do I recommend anyone I know, or whoever reads this review to go there. I’ve never been so mislead and played almost as a fool. The most insulted that I’ve ever felt ever in any other tire shop. Believe me these deals on their website are too good to be true! Better off going through tire rack or something because in the end the pricing is almost the same. And you’ll save your time, and have a better experiences.<//review>< response>

John the manager was outstanding and so was all the sales staff he helped me out in the pinch, my right front tire blew out 3 blocks away. I have no spare tire and had to drive on my flat to the store. No sooner then I pulled into a stall John the manager was at my door. I'm a disabled vet and I get a lot of ( thank you for your service) when people find out that I'm a vet, but  John and his staff put there money where his mouth is . Action  speak louder then words, he gave me my money's worth ,plus they locked for every discount they could find ,and threw in a flat repair warranty on my other 3 tires. If your a vet and your in need of tires ,oil changes etc. I highly recommend that go see these guys. I wish every business I patronize was as deserving of my customer loyalty, and recommendation as the professional crew at American tire depot......< /Text>

My first time going here and it was a great experience. I came here because they quoted me with great pricing to do my tires and wheel alignment. My tires and alignment is pretty smooth and good so far. I'm satisfied 😊They were friendly and professional. I'm definitely recommending you check them out.</Text>

I've been to several American Tire stores in my day, and this one is by far my favorite.  The people there are top notch.  I really appreciate John and his professionalism, and the way he runs his store.  His no hassle no frills approach had me in and out in no time flat - no pun intended.  :-)   Thanks John</Text>

<Text>John and the crew are great! I've taken my car, and my family's cars here for anything that I can't do myself. 9/10 times, they'll have the best prices in San Jose, and on the rare occasion that they don't, the 5 bucks per tire in difference isn't enough to turn me away from their store. They honor their customer promises, and have gone out of their way to do so. Even when they're busy, they always try to find time for you.

As long as I'm in San Jose, American Tire Depot will have my business.<//Text>< pictures>

The 4.5 hours I spent there this morning was good enough. I don't think I want to come back. Had an appointment at 10 and they didn't realize they didn't have my tires until 2 hours later and the place wasn't busy. I'm good. Left with my tire pressure light still on and was told to just come back if it doesn't go off eventually. I didn't even have time to argue.</Review>

I called this shop on accident thinking it was America’s Tire’s and could not be more happy that I did! I needed a specific tire which America’s tire did not have called American tire depot and spoke with John he then told me he would call me back and let me know if he could find those tires.. not only were the tires cheaper because of the buy 3 get 1 free but I was also able to get my car aligned,warranty and John still gave me a discount at the final purchase. The integrity and honesty of this shop could not be more transparent. John and all of his crew are solid! I will be back for all of my future work. Thankyou guys!<//review>

Fantastic service.  I have taken my car here twice for a flat or leaking tire.  They patched it up in no time.  Really recommend this place.</Review>

Great customer service, the manager John goes above and beyond making sure you are taken care of regardless of what your needs are. I waited about 2 hours and while in the lobby I saw how he treated all customers like family. Will definitely continue to bring my business here regardless of price.</Review>

<review>Literally thrown out of the shop. Just for asking the math behind the pricing of installing all 4 continental tires rather than just one  (for which I took the appointment initially) as I was given a different pricing by customer service (lower). Never ever going back to this shop nor will recommend anyone I know to go there. I wouldn’t name the manager and the co worker here, but i thought them to be initially very nice, i kept waiting for more than 2 hours to just get the pricing and than was told after me asking that the pricing that they are providing isn’t the same as website or one provided by customer service. The manager wasn’t even interested in listening and was overpowering stating that I am providing you best price and you are not accepting it. Well my overall point was to understand why is there a difference between his pricing than that on the website or customer service. To which I was than asked to go away from there.

Sorry to say but the shop also said that the pricing provided to you by customer service over the phone is fake, these people sit in Philippines and they know nothing, thus wouldn’t even consider their pricing as they dont understand pricing. Never ever i felt so insulted in a shop.

This is just a summary of what went there but it was much more insulting than written.<//review>< pics>

<review>Had a great experience and will definitely return.
Here are some details for other potential customers:
Pros:
1. Best tire price compared to Costco, Pepboys, Tire Choice and BigO'. They gave me the same buy 3 get 1 offer even when my tires where out of stock and they ordered it from Michelin.
2. I could schedule the appointment with in 1 day of placing my order. Which is far better than Costco's 21 day lead time.
3. The certified tire specialist took care of all my concerns and had the right updated tools for the job.
4. My IS350 Sport runs smooth. Gotta hand it to the mechanics, awesome team.
5. Additionally 3 years of tire warranty that covers even punchers was included in the price.
Cons:
1.As the shop following strict COVID Guidelines, it was short staffed. Due to which it took 4 hours for my job to be done. No hate, this was a safer thing to do.<//review>< user>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>I am sad to say this location offered a surprisingly bad experience.  I was traveling thru San Jose on business when two of my tires began losing pressure,  I added fix a flat to each but the flats were not fixed. So for the next 30 miles I continued to add air until i was able to reach this location. I had purchased full coverage tire insurance from my local A.T.D. and expected to have the tires fixed or replaced. The manager said that the warranty was voided when I added repair slime, and he could not locate more of the same tires for two days. He ended up "fixing" the tires and charged me.   I was able to make it home and went to my local A.T.D. who , after removing my wheels, informed me that my insurance was voided for both tires, not because of the fix a flat I put in, but because the San Jose store used plugs to seal the holes. Plugs are in direct violation of their policy and should never be used, also to top it off he filled out the paperwork "incorrectly" and hid the fact that they fixed the tires.
End result - $550 for 2 new tires< /review>< pictures>

These guys are great. If you are on the fence about whether to go there, just know that they will take care of your purchase for longer than any tire shop I have been too. They go above and beyond too. They of course will repair any tire you buy from them (say from a nail puncture), but after I bought a set of tires for my old car and then lost that car in an accident, they repaired a tire on the car I bought, no hustling me to get new tires or trying to alert me to unneeded repairs (which I knew I didn't need due to a recent inspection) - just great, fast service. When this set of tires does wear down, I will be going to these guys to get the next ones.< /review>

John, the manager was EXCELLENT!
Really friendly and knowledgeable.
I was going to buy 4 tires from a different company,but American tires BEAT BigOs tire prices!
Great energy and super nice employees.
Thank you!

My car has hard to find tires which normally takes 2-4 days to get. I needed something to get me through the rainy season. I was able to get the tires I wanted, at the price I wanted, the same day within 3 hours of closing with tires they didn’t carry on hand.
That’s great service! I highly recommend American Tire Depot in San Jose, Ca @ 1353 West San Carlos Street<//review>< pics>

This time my vehicle needed Cabin Air Filter replaced and Oil & Filter Changed. Both items I provided myself since I wanted only the best. Andrew was amazing! Even though they couldn’t get to my vehicle that morning as I only had a 2 hour window, he popped in my air filter in 10 seconds free of charge. I told him I would pay him for that and he said since I was coming back to get my oil changed I can just take care of it tomorrow. And I did exactly that. I returned the next morning and oil change was completed in about an hour. He also told me my vehicle actually requires 5.9 quarts of oil and I only purchased the 5 qt of Mobil 1 Synthetic which is what I’ve always done and brought to Lexus and they’ve never mentioned that I needed the additional 0.9 qt ever. So Andrew told me he would provide the additional qt of oil free of charge. Andrew charged me less than half of what Tires Unlimited would’ve for the same services. I will only bring my RX 350 to have serviced here in the future. Andrew is the best when it comes to customer service. But more importantly, he is honest, fair, and won’t overcharge you, which is a rarity in mechanics and auto shops nowadays.</Review><Name>Soon Foong< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Made an appointment through the online service, but apparently appointments aren't kept if they are made longer than a week out, nor are they allowed at the time that I booked.  Google Maps Open Hours are not accurate.  Never received a call about my appointment being cancelled.  Arrived to a closed store but the manager and team members were kind enough to help me remove a stuck a gas canister from under my car, though there were no tires available in my size.  Not angry at the particular employees just upset how the system is supposedly set up.  Not sure if I will try an American Tire Depot again.</text>

Came here first thing in the morning to have my wheel & tires rotated and balanced and also 4W Alignment. They completed the work in about 2 hours. Probably spent 15 minutes of time just entering my info into the system which was very slow. Also they don’t have Apple Pay which is a more secured way to complete transaction. So that’s my only complaint they could improve on. But I’m just being nit picky. The work done was great and customer service was equally good. They offered the lowest price which was the primary reason for bringing my vehicle here but they also had really positive reviews. So add one more positive review from a satisfied customer.< /review>

I went to the website and researched tires for my 2003 Navigator.  I found the tires recommended and then researched those tires.
I then settled on tires and called to get firm prices for installation.
I was satisfied with the prices and ordered the tires and set an appointment to get the work done.
Very satisfied with the work and services.
I will difinently return and highly recommend.< /Text>

I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that I arrived before 8am and had to wait 30 minutes before they could open. Apparently person with alarm code was late arriving and kept his workers and customers waiting.

Once I was helped I was quite impressed with the knowledge of their one mechanic  Allen, who pointed out some problems I had with my car that I wouldn't have been aware of. I strongly recommend asking for him if you go there.< /review>

<Text>Service was fast. Possibly the only positive. I felt like i wasn't asked the right questions when choosing a tire. And the worst part noone was wearing a mask, which made me uncomfortable.

American Tire Depot is what you would expect of a place with great customer service. From the moment you walk in you are welcomed with a smile and adequately attended to. This was my first time at this location where I met Art who took care of my immediate needs even though they were getting ready to close. I will be honest and say that because of the way he treated me and took care if my problem I will be coming to this location from now on and will be referring friends and family.  Thank you Art for helping me out the way you did!< /review>

<Text>I needed tires for my car. I messaged them last night. They got back to me in 30 minutes. And this was past 10 pm. In the morning, Arturo discussed what needed to be done, reviewed all my options. Gave me a reasonable deal and put 4 new tires. The car, BMW X3 , drives great now. Arturo has integrity, competent and knows his business. I recommend him highly.< /Text><UserId.>110087567672213952707</UserId.>< response>

<Review>I called a day before to inquire about tires. Was told  the tires would be there after 11:00 am the next day. When I arrived the tires were not there an was told they didn't have time change the tires on my car but would do their best to accommodate my car however I had to wait till 7:00 pm. Left and called another American tire Depot and found out that no store had it in stock. Meaning they would have to pull it from their warehouse. Which is what the guy had said the day before but didn't bother to do it. That same day I had called the store directly and was put on hold for 20 minutes before deciding to hang up.

Free brake check and estimate.  When I went in they were super busy.  The Mgr came out, asked me how he could help me.  I told him I thought I needed new brakes because my Mitsubishi had not had a brake job since I bought it new in 2010!! It has 90k miles on it. I let him know there was no squeaking or any other symptoms,  I just thought it HAD to be time because it was now eight years old.  He let me know it would be an hour to take it apart and go r it a good check.
I went for breakfast,  and when I came back,  he told me he could tell how I drove my car by the way my brakes were NOT worn out.  He told me I could definitely go a bit longer,  but it would be a good idea to go ahead and replace the pads simply because of time and summer heat.  Yeah,  so, an eight year old car, with 90k miles and dude is SO totally honest he tells me I don't need new brakes right this minute.
I made an appointment for next Sat.

I've been going to this shop for around 1.5 years now for anything from oil changes to car repairs and I've had an outstanding experience with honest low prices every single time. Especially - Art, the store's manager is an awesome guy who works incredibly hard to give the best service and I'd recommend his service to anyone.< /review>

I  got a flat tire at 1:30 am after dropping a co-worker off at his home and made a quick stop at Safeway store when I walked out of the the store and went my vehicle my tire was flat, I sat there until 10:30 am for my job to put my lay on my card,  I was going to go downtown where I normally would go to get my tire replaced and I was actually at the bus stop stop something  made me look up  and I saw  American tire Depot and decided to give them a call call I looked them up on Google and saw they have tires brand  new starting at 24.99 and I called them explained that I broke down at 1:30 am and waited until morning to get the tire fixed and it turns out that I didn't have enough money to get my tire and these guys had the cheapest one was $46.99 plus the cost of having tire mounted would've cost me over what I had , so they charged me $40.00 for the tire and since I didn't have my vehicle there with me they didn't charge me. Well these guys  came down to what  I was able to afford instead of turning me a way  that was a blessing and I thank them for helping me get back on the road again so I can keep working. Thank you! Lord and thank you American tire Depot for helping me when I really needed it.< /text>

Knocked a star off just because the mechanic didn't properly store my spare tire.  Noticed it when i went to the grocery store and opened my trunk.  The dirty spare tire was thrown on top of my stuff in the trunk instead of properly stored in the spare tire space below.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x808fcb602eb75f19:0x86f809be4f609c6d</gmap_id>< name>

While visiting from out of town I noticed a tire was very low. Fearing a nail or something I went to several tire shops but none could get me in. The guys st American Tire Depot got me in and said my valve stem was bad. They replaced it and refilled my tire with nitrogen for no charge! That were very helpful and generous. If I even need and tire related things while in town, I will go to them! Thank you.< /Text>

<user_name>lil capalot<//user_name><Time>1569288349968< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Wow! I couldn't believe how bad the service was in the San Carlos store today!
First I had to wait almost 15 minutes for someone to come to the desk. It was a tech who went to get the desk person. Then the older, hyper man behind the desk charged me an extra $23 for the "deal" I was supposed to be getting to best the competitions price. I was going to leave at that time, but I checked the competitors site and they nolonger had available appointments until the next day. I asked why the customer service reps didn't say anything about not being able to match or better the competitors price? The older, hyper man said, "the girls in the call center don't know what they are doing, they don't know what items to add on for the cars".

I tell ya, it keeps getting worse from here.

When the older, hyper man printed out the work order form he kept snatching it out of my hand when I tried to read it, repeatedly slapped the form on the desk saying, "You don't need to read it, I told you what's on it and I have a copy here for you to read later, just sign!" I told him I wasn't signing anything until after I read it! He then turned to the "male" customer next to me saying, "I don't know why she doesn't believe me!" The male customer replied, "She's right, that's the way it's supposed to be! She shouldn't sign until after she reads and understands it" The older, hyper man just walked away.
After reading the form and finding a mistake in the total he gave me, the older, hyper man checked my calculations and said, "even if the amount is wrong I can't change the total on the page because this is the total the system gave me." All of the customers in the lobby looked at each other in dis belief. The older, hyper man checked the numbers over and over again until he said that he "forgot" to show me another charge/fee/tax on the back of the form. He repeatedly said he didn't tell me that the only charges were on the front of the form. After repeating his standard message, he realized I again was right and he said "the total is here on the front, and you sign on the back of the form next to the total." I asked him to calm down and focus on me, the customer standing in front of him" because his bouncing around wasn't helping anyone. In fact, I he continuously gave the wrong car information to the mechanics and they had to stop doing the work they started because it was done on the wrong car! I mean, how do you mix up a Toyota and a Mercedes?

I just had to stop talking and listening to this man until I saw he was doing the same thing to another woman who came in. I ended up telling this teacher to go to Calderon tires down the street to get the help she needed patching up a nail hole in her tire. Because the older, hyper man she was trying to talk to refused to even turn around and fully face her to talk about her problem.

LADIES, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!
I want someone in customer service to contact me. I was confimation #7795 on September 23, 3019 last name JONES.< /review>< Pics>

This was my first time going to this place and I was skeptical, but my worries were erased when I spoke with the owner/manager. The owner/manager is extremely friendly and great. The staff finished my service quicker than expected, which was pretty neat.</Text>

Wasting 2 hours here. After waiting for near 2 hours, they couldn’t find the tires they sold me earlier. Didn’t have any other options. Had to put the old tires back and going somewhere else. Never will come back here and don’t recommend them. However the workers were fine.<//Review>

<review>Good customer service and friendly staffs, nice waiting room, but poor workmanship and very careless.

All the lugnuts on 4 wheels were over-torqued at over 175ft/lb!!  The spec for lugnut torque is 70-90 ft/lb. Over torque can cause serious damage to not only the lugnut, but the studs and brake disk too! I'm sorry but that is basically automotive 101.

In addition, after getting my wheel serviced, I've noticed lots of chip/gravel marks on 2 of my wheels. Those chip marks can only happen when the wheel is fallen/placed faced down on the ground! It should always be laid faced UP so the the face don't get damaged!< /review></record>

<Review>I called American to get a set of special order tires and was understandably told it’d take a few days but they’d be in on a Tuesday. I set an appointment for the following Friday so they would have extra time to arrive. I asked the lady taking the order if I needed to pre-pay or put down a deposit because of the special size and she said No.

Act Two - I show up on Friday and the Manager says the tires aren’t there but they are at a warehouse and he can have them the next day IF I gave him $100 deposit so he could go get them. Everyone’s time is valuable and I just lost an afternoon going to an appointment. I asked him why I should pay a deposit now when I offered and was told it wasn’t necessary and he just said that’s the way it was. I called the line I ordered from and the person that answered gave me the number for Justin Debrum the Regional Manager to find a solution. I left a voice mail and never heard back. American’s people don’t care about their customers and because of it lost a $950 sale.

Act Three - I called Wheel Works and in less than a day I got the same tires and saved $50.</Review><Name>Rob Allen< /Name>< gmap_id>

It's 2nd time I bought a set of tires from them. I used to go to America's Tires but their prices are more than American Tire Depot for the same tires. Hopefully their after sale services will be good also. For sure the guys at sj shop are great friendly guys.</text>

We were here celebrating our 10 years dating anniversary. Very friendly staff, great service for sure. But the taste of food does not match the price unfortunately. We ordered the special salmon belly bread, and butternut squash soup, the lamb. For the price point I would expect above average food experience. But all of the dishes is lack of the flavor. The salmon bread is actually the best of all. The butternut squash soup cant taste the freshness and sweetness of the butternut squash, and the lamb🙈so dry and not much flavor, just a little bit of cumin taste on the bone part of the rack, I wish it would have a bit more sauce besides the circle. I cook better dry rub lamb rack at home, definitely not worth 38 something dollar. But the vegetable(mushroom, pickle) surprisingly so flavorful. My husband's waygu beef steak wasn't juicy or full of beef flavor either, his dish is 40 something dollar. I think they need to master how to bring out the meat flavor as well as keep the juice inside the meat.<//Text>

The food was good, and had unique flavor combinations, but the overall experience didn't quite match our expectations nor the bill. The best dish was the lamb, and while portion sizes were not tiny they could have been a little bigger.

For service, our waiter offered a taste of wine to pair with our meal, which was nice, but later on missed an item that we had ordered. When our mains arrived, we asked about it only to be challenged that we had ordered it at all. They corrected the issue, but since they had already brought the main out things were out of order. Secondly, we reserved through open table, and indicated that the reservation was for a birthday. However, our waiter nor any servers didn't mention anything. It's like the information didn't get passed though at all. Concisely, the service wasn't impeccable.</review>

Loved, loved, loved this dinner! Such fantastic tasting food. Enjoyed every thing ordered. Definitely worthy of a Michelin star, if not two. I'll definitely come back the next time in Solvang. Service was great; friendly and informative. Wine list is fantastic, but the coqlicout wine was absolutely divine. Thank you for making our 1 year wedding anniversary special!</Review>

Fantastic restaurant in Solvang.  The chef has some Michelin heritage under his belt and that experience shows up in the delightful menu.  Chose from a variety of offerings to make up a good meal.

The duck wings were a spectacular start. Followed by amazing beets, Spanish octopus, and wagyu.  Did not care for the pork belly but the pear ball for desert more than made up for any other shortcomings.  It was a hard chocolate ball, once cracked open reveals nuggets of deliciousness.

Wine selection by the glass is primarily their own house wines (Coquelicot).  Had the Viognier, Pinot noir, and Grenache.  While the wines are OK I don’t think that they are the best choices.   They do have other wines to chose from by the bottle and would opt for that next time.<//text>

Good food. OK service. Nice ambience. Wine prices are aggressive, corkage is excessive ($30, but waived if you buy one of their expensive bottles).<//Review>

<Text>The food here is a little bit pricey. We wanna order a 4 course meal to share and was told the food amount is very limited, it won’t be enough. The cooking technique is somewhat Michelin way however the quality of the material is just so-so if comparing with the same price in south French. Only one waitress to serve all tables, so she is quite busy dealing with all customers. Delicate but not enough to feed yourself.</Text>< user_name>

I loved my dinner here. Absolutely fabulous, and each course was absolutely delicious.  I had the 4 course which was a little too much food for me, however make sure you don't eat prior or you can order the 3 course, so you can finish everybite. The service was 5 star. Friendly and attentive staff. I will absolutely be back.<//Review>

Had a wonderful experience. I had the 2-2-1 and each course was divine. As a starter I had the Duck wings and kimchi cracklings. After eating the wings I will be hard pressed to enjoy chicken wings again. The cracklings reminded me of fried pork skin in appearance but they were light and airy and actually had no resemblance to the kimchi I have had in Korean restaurants. My two entrees were the pork cheeks with delicious mashed potatoes and the wagyu beef with roasted fingerling type potatoes. Both exceeded my expectations and my dessert was chocolate mousse with honeycomb brittle. Michael, our server, was efficient and helpful and didn't rush us through each course. It was a relaxing and thoroughly wonderful experience.<//Text>

While this place is very expensive it is an amazing experience. It is eating a different way, slowly with small courses paired with great wine. It is an amazing place and a go to for special events in the family!</Text>

Intimate dining experience. Wonderful Prix Fixe dinner selection that flows nicely. My wife and I really enjoyed the meal and the service. The ambience is chic and elegant. The music however did not match the ambiance at all (50s oldies pop??) Hahaha. Easy fix, only mention because of the funny contrast to the ambiance. Highly recommend this spot!< /review>

<Review>Food, service, and atmosphere are all on point. Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Loved the lobster, soft shell crab, and pork belly. And the cauliflower, beef tenderloin...you get the idea - not a bad thing on the menu. Very cute setting in the front parlor of a hotel in downtown Solvang. I would recommend and will be coming back.<//Review>< pics>

This is a must dine at location in Solvang. Make a reservation to ensure you can get in. The food is superb, and will leave a lasting impression. During our visit we chose from 5 starters, 5 entrees and 3 desserts. From the intimate setting, beautifully designed courses and superb wine list, it is clearly not just the best of Solvang but easily in the best of the west coast. I can't imagine any future trip to the area that won't include a stop at First and Oak. While every course was amazing, the lobster bisque and halibut courses were above all others.< /text>

Hidden little gem in Solvang - the food really is world class. I was floored with the originality of the dishes, and of course the taste. From rabbit tacos to the sea bass, it was all tremendous. HIGHLY recommend!</text>

A beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, and, above all, great food.
So tasty, full of creative flavors, wonderfully presented.
A Michelin star quality in all aspects.<//review>

<Text>Big disappointment - super pretentious presentation and BS without any substance to back it up.  Had 4 dishes and all were a big fail. Nothing was delicious, I don't get where these 4+ star reviews are coming from.  I was here on a special occasion and thankfully my company made up for the really lousy food.

Dining at First & Oak felt more like an experience than a meal. The small plate concept allowed us to enjoy multiple dishes which came out looking like artwork and tasting just as good! Apparently the chef worked at a 3-star Michelin restaurant, which was really cool to hear. Overall - incredible food, service, and ambiance. Do not miss this gem while in Solvang!<//Text>

Hands down the best dinner and culinary experience you'll have in Solvang... and just about anywhere else. My girlfriend and I made a reservation for dinner after a day of wine tasting in Los Olivos. Our server knew everything on the menu and at her suggestion we went with a 3 course & 4 course dinner, this way between the two of us we had an opportunity to try just about everything we wanted. I started off with the Duck Wings, they were spectacular, and I can't choose which I enjoyed more between the Halibut and Kampachi. All in all a great experience, we will definitely be back!< /Review>

<Text>Phenomenal. I don't eat seafood, but tried the scallops. It was amazing. I also had the duck breast for the main coarse and was floored by how great it was. There wasn't a single thing I, or my wife, had that was bad. I would recommend this place hands down. It was expensive though, as the $75 wine, added to the $125 meal, ended up being a little more than I would have liked. However, after eating the meal, I can say that it was worth it.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>First & Oak was truly an amazing experience from beginning to end.  I cannot believe that they offer a five-course menu for a mere $80.  I have done tasting and chef's menus all over, and believe me, it is never less than $100 per person.  They offer premium ossetra caviar with an upcharge, it is literally less here than when ordered from Dean & Deluca! Same brand!  Food was beautiful and delicious.  Service was informative and warm.  Wine list was exceptional.  If you like a leisurely meal, where you can savor and enjoy, this is the place for you.  We were never rushed, food was timed perfectly.  We left completely satisfied.  We will recur.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Table service is excellent, food is comparable to serval other restaurants within Solvang proper, but terrible (read: rude) hostess- enough for us to not return. Try Frescos for lunch (incredible price point and so so delicious, but casual) or Succulent for dinner (amazing diversity of farm-to-table options, most of them organic or sustainable, and such incredible service) OR Mad and Vin at the Lansky hotel- who also also have an insane happy hour.

****if you’re under 40 with a decently rounded/sophisticated palate skip the age-ism and cruise to Succulent : )</Text></record></dataset><record>

Seeing open tables does not mean that those tables will stay open or in some cases we are at capacity. We truly hope to be able to make it up to you and the next time you are in town I would love to take excellent care of you and show you that we are not a 1 star restaurant but a 5 star restaurant.  Please email me when you are ready to come in and I will prepare a few surprises for you, Jonathan@firstandoak.com Thank you!'}< /response>

<review>(Translated by Google) It was said that there were no high chairs with a baby, and the inside of the store was not in an atmosphere like a baby. I was happy to hear if I could eat there because there was a place like the waiting room next door. The staff was very good and the food was very good. I want to visit again.

赤ちゃん連れで来店、ハイチェアはないと言われ、店内は赤ちゃん連れで入るような雰囲気ではなかった。たまたま隣の待合室のようなところが空いていたのでそこで食べさせてもらえるか聞いたところ快くOK頂きました。スタッフの感じも非常によく、何より料理がとても美味しかった。また来店したい。<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr. Amir is hands down one of the the most knowledgeable and skilled Orthodontists in Los Angeles. He always makes sure I don't have any pain or discomfort. As a patient, I feel like I'm being respected and listened to at all times when I am around him--something that other providers often lack. Dr. Amir definitely cares about the quality of care that he delivers to all his patients. His office staff are super friendly and organized. You always leave his office with a literal smile on your face. I would recommend everyone I know to him.</Text>< name>

After pursuing many doctors, I ultimately chose Dr. Amir (Bergh Orthodontist) for a complicated treatment of the grown up set of teeth I had. He is the best orthodontist in the LA area in my opinion, and I am truly grateful to my friend that referred me to him. Dr. Amir is very kind and really cares about getting you the best results possible. You may go to any orthodontist and get braces, but you won’t get the kind of attention to detail, experience and expertise that only Dr. Amir and his team can provide. You should expect a pleasant experience from the front office through the dental chair. Dr. Amin knows what he is doing, he is so down to earth and humble. And, I would recommend him to anyone.<//review>

I came to see Amir and I couldn’t be happier with my results.
The line in my upper teeth was never straight
Something that bothered me for the longest time.
Thankfully Amir was able to fix that for me
And I now have a perfect smile I am so proud of.
Highly recommend Amir as your orthodontist.
Very patient and professional< /Review>

I called and make an appointment for the free consult! The staff was amazing and Dr. Amir answered all my questions. He walked me through treatment planning and gave me straight forward price with no hidden fees. Best experience ever! Highly recommend this place.</Review>

It is very hard to put in words just how AMAZING Dr. Amir truly is. It is hard to find a Doctor who you can trust and who really genuinely cares about his patients, and I can assure you that he is one of the few. From the moment he completes the evaluation he explains what is the best option of treatment with your best interest at heart. He is very professional, friendly, honest, and very detailed on his work. In every visit he takes the time to explain what will be done and what to expect on your next visit. He is very good at answering any questions or concerns that might come up during the process of the braces. He has one of the best virtues a person can have, patience. If you want fix your smile I recommend for you to come get treated by him, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.<//Review>

<review>I had the greatest experience with Dr. Amir and his entire team. They helped me from the very beginning and made me feel very special through my Invisalign process. Recently was the end of my treatment and I am thrilled and endlessly happy with my results. They gave me my confidence back!!
I will always be thankful for the greatest dedication, knowledge, care and love you guys showed me since my first consultation.
All the best always for you Dr. Amir in your career and in your life!! :)</review>< pictures>

<text>Dr Amir treated two of my children and I couldn’t have been happier. His personality was so impressive and friendly that it really encouraged my kids to take care of their teeth exactly as they were told to. Dr. Amir really gave 100% to make sure that the end result was perfect and never cut corners, many times going out of his way to do so. One of my kids did regular braces and the other Invisalign and he knew what each child needed. His work is professional and he really knows what he’s doing. We can’t thank him enough.</text>< pictures>

Need to take time to share our experience about Dr Amir and his facility so others can benefit from his phenomenal skills and his team..
We have had the pleasure of Dr Amir for the past few years... we are very fortunate to have come across Dr Amir after lots of research and meetings with other clinics as soon as we met Dr Amir we knew he was the one for our son keyaan.
He's experience and knowledge really come through at our initial consultation, my son keyaan quickly came very comfortable with Dr and his team.. There professionalism Dr is very caring and when it comes to his work he is very meticulous!! We was nervous at the beginning but once Dr explained the process in much detail we was relived and 100% trusted Dr Amir and he's recommendations fast forward now our son keyaan has had he's braces on and we are super excited as we can see all the progress and results just like Dr Amir said!!! Thank you Dr Amir and team you guys are simply the best!!! Love from keyaan and family!!!</text>

From the day I went in for a consultation to the day I got my braces off Dr. Bergh and his staff have been absolutely amazing. Everyone was always super FRIENDLY, the office was always SPOTLESS and Dr. Bergh’s attention to detail on correcting my smile made my experience one I’ll never forget. I’m so in LOVE with my new smile and have received so many compliments. If you’re looking to fix your smile I highly recommend going in for a consultation.
Thank you so much Dr. Bergh and staff. ♥️< /Text>

<Text>I was very shy about my smile, and really wanted to get it looking good. I wen't into Dr. Bergh's office 4 years ago. When I went in, I explained to him what kind of smile I wanted and he was very tentative, professional, caring and patient. His entire staff is highly professional and provide excellent service overall. I know myself, I'm a picky person and him and his staff met all my needs. He recommend Invisalign as an option, and even showed me what my teeth would look like by the end of the treatment. Fast forward 14 months later and he delivered a better smile than what I asked for. It's been almost 3 years since my treatment and I smile all the time. I constantly have people asking where I got my teeth done. I've referred friends and family and they all go to Dr. Bergh now. I hadn't seen him in over 2 years and I just got off a tele-health appointment with him to check in on my retainers. He treats you like family, and is still very tentative to all your needs. He doesn't treat his patients as a transaction, he genuinely cares and wants to make sure you're happy with everything. Thank you again doc, sorry this review took so long.< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Bergh is an amazing doctor with a friendly and inviting personality, I can see why he’s a legend in the field of Orthodontics. As for the treatment, the ortho team is one of the best. You will feel no pain nor discomfort AT ALL when getting your scans and pictures. If you want the best care, customer service, and a perfect smile I only recommend Bergh Orthodontics.<//Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Bergh and his staff receive 5 stars. They are all amazing at explaining what my daughters plan is for her braces, what to expect through the process and always smiling and making my daughter feel comfortable. As soon as you walk into the office, you are greeted with a secretary with a beautiful smile. The office is always clean and well organized. Dr. Bergh has a beautiful fish tank that my daughter and I enjoy looking at. They use a system that promotes effective communication with their staff and with the patients.<//text>

Dr. Bergh is the best orthodontist I have ever encountered -  willing to partner with other dentists to provide you with an wholistic approach to bringing about good dental care.  I couldn’t recommend anyone more highly, great office, great facility, great staff, great dentist.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

Stepping into the Glendale Bergh Orthodontics office is always an amazing experience. You're always greeted with a smile & the computer check-in process is super easy. By the time you're done brushing your teeth, you're called back and walked over to your chair. I appreciate the personal attention they give me each and every time. Its always a pleasant and quick visit. They don't waste time and get right to business. Every visit is short, yet very thorough. Can't beat that! Thank you Bergh Orthodontics!!!</text>

<review>I had difficult alignment issues with my teeth. Six other orthodontists were consulted, and none knew how to resolve the issues.  Dr. Bergh's skill and patience are unequaled and his staff are polite, competent and made me feel like family.  The scheduling of treatment and follow-up appointments is very accommodating for a busy professional.  Thanks to Dr. Bergh and his team, my teeth have perfect alignment and I truly have a million dollar smile.<//review><user>110406311846530913001</user><resp>None< /resp><rating>5<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2c04c7febdfdb:0x5983bf87352b2f8< /Gmap_id>< name>

This place is amazing.  Extremely professional and friendly. It is such a fun and interactive experience for kids.  My 8 year old loved it when we went there.  They explained all the different stations to him.  The sink with brushing area is a genius idea.  He also loved that he could check himself in using their computer. Dr. Bergh is super nice and knowledgeable.
He went over all of my son's x-rays and explained what our next step would be. Overall a very nice environment.</text>

Dr. Bergh is a great Orthodontist I would recommend him to anyone that I know without question at all.  I may be biased but I will not stay for my daughter's braces if I was not a satisfied customer. His assistant's are great and friendly. The ladies at the front office  are great. Keep those smiles to continue to have happy patients and family 😁.< /Text>

We were 12 mins late and I had called to let them know we will be late. But when we got there, they entertained us like we were just in time. They were very polite and professional as always. They didn’t let us wait forever as a punishment. That was nice and I give the staff a five-star for that. Means a lot because there was really no way for us to be on time last night. Thank you.</Text>

I am a 30 year old with Invisalign braces. When I first went in for a consult the entire staff was friendly. They offered water including a free nifty bag with small useful goods. It was one of the best decisions of my life to proceed with getting treatment here. I am a year into my treatment and my teeth have shown so much improvement. The office is very clean, spacious and everyone helpful. Dr. Bergh is quiet but will take care of your teeth and very informative. My insurance has good coverage so my total cost was around 4000 but so worth it!< /review>

My 23 year old daughter was under the care of Dr. Bergh for seven years starting in 2nd grade. She was a complicated case with a few missing permanent teeth but the outcome was a beautiful smile all the same. The office was always welcoming and accommodating and even today, my college graduate is seen by Dr. Bergh once every year or two to make sure the retainer is a good fit. I highly recommend Dr. Bergh and his staff for any orthodontic work you or your family might need.</text>

Dr Bergh and his entire staff are absolutely wonderful. I've been into the office several times now and EACH TIME they are extremely professional as well as extremely nice & accommodating (even when I'm running late). Even brought my 5 month old to an appt once, as I had no babysitter, and they took care of both of us! And oh yeah, my teeth look great! Would definitely recommend.< /Review>

I have to say his assistants are very well-trained and very nice. They are welcoming to you and would do anything for you. Thank you for all your work Dr. Bergh & staffs.

<text>I got my braces in 1998 with Dr. Bergh and I was very happy with the results and the staff. My 12yr old daughter is now a patient of Dr Bergh and I am just as happy with his caring staff and Dr. Bergh’s patience for kids. I highly recommend, Bergh Orthodontics! 👍</text>< Pics>

Dr. Bergh's office is always kind and professional. They are delicate and considerate in the care that they provide. We have never had to wait longer than a few minutes to begin our appointment. Our family highly recommends this office.</review>

I've been searching for the best orthodontist in Glendale to fix my gaps and my friends brother used to be his patient and he highly recommended Dr. Bergh. The staff are very friendly and professional and you always get sitted on time unlike other dentist offices. I highly recommend him to anyone who likes to have a glorious smile with strong confidence. I love how their X-Ray are 80% safer compare to other places and their finance option works perfect for me</review>

The BERG'S ORTHODONTICS is one of a kind!  Not only because of the utmost professionalism amongst the employees but the intimacy they make you feel.  From Dr. BERGH, who's middle name is "very professional in every way", to everyone working for him, they are just extremely wonderful. More power to all of you!!!!!!!<//Text>

Don’t be fooled by the great staff and the gifts sent home .
Dr Burgh put my child through 2 full years of pain and discomfort by having my 8 year old wear lower removable retainer, after many visits after 2 years he could not adjust the retainer any longer and throw it on the tray in front of my 20 year old now and said I don’t know what to do anymore . He refunded me the money I had paid and said he is sorry he can’t continue he has reached a point where he doesn’t know what to do . Really ?????    I found another great Dr where they put fixed retainers and do things my h much better and they don’t buy their patients with gifts .< /Review>

Dr. Bergh's staff is always welcoming. It is evident customer service is a priority.  The technicians take the time to explain the service my child has received and answer any questions I might have. Dr. Bergh has a calm energy that eases my daughter immediately.  The point system motivate young patients to be responsible in bringing their patient cards for cool prizes.  I am very happy I chose Dr. Bergh and his amazing staff for my child's braces! Highly recommend!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><time>1526512463947< /time><text>Dr. Bergh and his staff are friendly and professional. My son actually looks forward to his orthodontic appointments!  He's been seeing Dr. Bergh for over 2 years now, but is still only in the beginning stages of his treatment,. Being that he's only 9, he hasn't even started with his Invisalign treatment yet.  I'm grateful that Dr. Bergh has been patient and attentive to his development and is waiting for the appropriate time to move forward with Invisalign.  I really appreciate this because I know that many orthodontists rush the process, so they can make money.  The only thing Dr. Bergh has has charged me for is the retainer he recommended my son wear at night, and this fee was a modest one with a generous payment plan. I am overwhelmed by the results of the retainer.  His overbite used to be so pronounced not only did kids make fun of him at school, but it was also a danger when he played sports like soccer and basketball.  His front teeth have corrected so well that he is now safer and not getting made fun of.  I look forward to the continued care Dr. Bergh will provide my son as he continues the process.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Not for the squeamish.
Didn't appreciate the self help book, but all the staff seems caring, courteous and proficient in their work.

<review>This review is long long long overdue. I don't even know where to begin...

I visited a few orthodontists who said the only way to fix my open bite was with surgery. I couldn't eat burritos or pizza without a fork and knife and I had a terrible lisp. I really wanted to fix it but was unwilling to have my face sawed. Finally, a friend referred me to Dr. Bergh, who was the only person willing to try a less invasive method to fix my bite.

After a year in a retainer, he felt that we could close it the rest of the way with invisaline. And YES!!! We did!!!! Surgery would have taken one year of healing plus two additional years to have the bone structure back to normal. I'd say the conservative route was a fantastic decision!

Listen to what he tells you. Do not get lazy with your braces and you will be shocked at the results. Best ortho on the planet!<//review><response>None< /response>< rating>

My son is under treatment for invisiline at Bergh Orthodontist, it has been 7 weeks since he started his treatment. The office staff are absolutely professional with appointments and reminders. The atmosphere at the office is very calm and relaxing. Today, my son saw the result of changes in his teeth that took place within the last 7 weeks. Doctor and the nurse explain and give directions efficiently. I have to mention that my son wears his invisiline all the time and follows doctors directions.
We are happy so far and recommend dr Bergh orthodontist.<//text>

<Text>Had a lovely breakfast here! A BLT sandwich with 2 pancakes for less than $10?? Are you kidding me? 55+ menu, of course. :) And the team here was excellent; courteous, thoughtful and very prompt. Food was very good, and Arnulfo was a pleasure as my server. I’m thrilled!<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqbRnGwTtT6cCHEgFWnAZfMLMW49nzXyldqnUv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgmUDwuUc74H-Ad48KmRbVfYNEEPK3De_6007Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8N9RaH0DCA_dUAt1Dvz4oil8BNi6u7qgT_-9U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgk03Nk0pgaP3KCkBUbPyTe_JhXmEJTsdLZ9mz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80e96aaab11283e9:0x961ee265a173fec2<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>My experience at this IHOP was very fulfilling especially since the last 2 times I've gone to locations in my area of Santa Clarita were very disappointing to say the least. First off...The server, Eric, was fantastic! He was very attentive, courteous and respectful. When I asked for something he was quick about it, not like other restaurants where you have to wait forever to get something. Secondly...The pancakes were the way you'd expect a IHOP to serve...Moist & fluffy! No crumbling after you put syrup and splitting apart! They have a customer for life!< /Text>< Response>

The service and food is good, but you need to wait (between 15 or 30 minutes) for a table due to COVID restrictions.</review>

The food was absolutely amazing. The time and attention to the customer wasn't the best. I had to wait a long time for them to come and get my order and at times it seemed like they had forgotten about us. However I could tell they were trying their best and the server was very apologetic and was trying their best to make up for the wait time and at times lack of service. Would definitely recommend giving it a shot and I'm definitely going to be going back.</review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Went in at almost closing time still we were able to be seated. The food was great and hot as they brought it out. Now they were really busy since the university had their graduation that night. Now the reason this Ihop is getting a 4 star review is because it would have been nice for the employees to communicate with their guests coming in to dine. We waited around 20 minutes before being seated and not once did they come to give us an update on our table. We had already been told our table was being worked on. While we waited a family of I want to say 10 came in and was standing at the counter. Keep in mind we had already been waiting for a table for 8. Once the waiter came to ask them for how many they needed a table, my nephew asked him is our table ready? He hesitated and said yes. We asked if we can get our drink order in even that took long. Once seated it did not look too full but they were real behind as the man who took our order mentioned that. Took them about 10 minutes to bring out my nephews milkshake. The kids were hungry and just in overall took too long to get seated and to get our food. Will not be going here again. They need to improve on the communication amongst each other and their customers.</Review>< Pictures>

I generally have a salad and like the grilled veggies. Staff is very friendly, but yesterday I had to wait 20 minutes for the server to check on us to refill my diet Coke. And then she was just bringing the bill. This wasn't a first time event. Two weeks ago, my boyfriend put down$40 for a $20 bill and never got his change, so someone got a big tip! These things are why I don't give IHOP five stars.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

The facility is old. Has been freshened but still has a very old school seating area. Food served quickly, service checks back often. The staff is friendly. Compared to other local  breakfast/lunch full service options in area, it is rated a moderate value.
I had the Who-Beast omlet and it was huge, and served the two of us with a plate split for about 25 tax and tip included. Very tasty and hot. The coffee is good but no espresso option is available; I think that is a needed item for today's Starbucks crowd. Overall, a good experience.<//review><username>Bruce Byers</username>< UserId.>

Were sat in a section that did not seem to have a server. Drink order was taken fairly quick but not correct for all. Coffee only filled a quarter of way and no pot left. Once we finally got a server and a pot of coffee the rest of the meal was good.< /review>

< Review>
Waited incredibly long. The people at the door didn't even say wait will be more than 30 min. Nobody said we could take a seat in the seating area. They didn't offer us to sit at the bar either. When we finally got to our table we waited additional 15 minutes before our order was taken. Overall wait was 1 hour and 10 minutes. After the food finally arrived they got my eggs and my one kids eggs wrong. I asked for medium done got underdone eggs that had runny egg whites. My son was offered more orange juice, but never got it. We initially wanted hot chocolate, but the place had run out of stock. The meat I got was not nice it had too much sugar added while cooked. Onions were undercooked. The waiters and the hostess had very heavy accent and were very difficult to communicate with.
Overall, quite a bad experience.

Probably never going back at this location, despite being the closest to my house.<//Review>

Expect to see your server only 3 times - for order, food drop-off, and bill. If you need anything in between, good luck getting anyone to help you. We tried waving down a server once because we needed ketchup. He nodded at us then walked away and never came back. One of them is so bad, expect to need to get the manager in order to place your order!<//Text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

<text>We had one of my worst experiences tonight. We wanted to flavor coffee in a blue cheese burger. The flavored coffee was over flavor and not even hot and the Burger came with cheddar cheese on it rather than blue cheese.
When asked about the fact that a blue cheese burger was ordered the survey said that she could just bring some blue cheese to put  on it. This was by far some of the worst customer service Food Service that I that we have received even in Santa Barbara<//text>< pictures>

It always surprises me at how expensive the foods are. Filling, yes, but I feel like it's a chain so the prices shouldn't be what they are. Especially the coffee.< /Review>

<review>Well. We ended up waiting for our food for so long we didn't even want to mention anything when it wasn't even hot food. All the waiters seemed to be taking their sweet ass time doing anything. They're all talking behind the counter while we are waiting for our check to get out of here. Recommendation: find another place to eat or be thoroughly disappointed< /review>< time>

Slow service. Salad put on hot plate. Wilted. Complained. Got new salad. 100 times better. Overall, not the fast service one expects at Ihop.  Pancakes are always awesome, though.<//review>

Hmmmmm as an older adult it's great for quick trips with kids but I wouldnt voluntarily eat here alone.. it's hard to explain the food.. it is food but looks, smells and tastes like it was made to taste the way it does... idk if that makes sense so go check it out for yourself then it might make sense?< /Review>

I don't eat at IHOP expecting anything fancy or special -- just decent comfort food and big portions.  Maybe I went on a bad day, but I got indifferent service and below-par food.< /text>

<Review>We visit this IHOP once every couole of weeks, its quite busy during weekends, especially around 10am. Food here is good, people serving food are good too, we usually have gardern omelet, tilapia, strawberry banana french toast. All of those items i mentioned are pretty good here. Only issue is sometimes the wait time, if its a busy hour then we usually have to wait but that's common at popular places. I would recommend this IHOP to people visiting.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

3 people ordered a breakfast,I ordered a chicken Cobb salad. My salad finally came after everyone else was done eating. I just put it in a to go box and we left. The waiter was extremely apologetic but there's no excuse for that. It's awkward to just sit there while everybody is eating. It was 1:30 pm. I Will never eat there again.</review>

We got to our table, and we were sitting there cluelessly for about 10 minutes without anyone coming over and taking our order or checking on us. Finally a woman came to take our orders and we got our drinks, and we waited 40 minutes and never got our food so we left!!! Not to mention we sat near a family with an annoying screaming baby.

Very rude waiters! Apparently they don't like their customers to share food, it hurts their profit! I went there with my wife and we ordered a french toast to share, the rude waiter warned to me I won't be able to share my drink with my wife which I was ordering for myself. What a rude and cheap place!</review>

It is ok if you are hungry. Kind of expensive for the quality of the food. It is not bad, but it is not very good either. The good thing is that normally the waiting times are very short and the service is good.<//text>

<review>Unsanitary! 20+ flies on the wall where we sat. Horrible service from our waitress but other tables had great service from their waitresses so she just didn't like our table. She rushed to take our order at first (5 minutes from sitting) and didn't care that there was some confusion with the new pancake combo platters so she urged to pick one of the three holiday when he just wanted plain. Our hashbrowns were ordered extra crispy and first one came out prefect the other came out boiled, sent it back and it was still not crispy like the first. She was rude and the ticket says her name was Nancy, she never apologized for the confusion or the accuracy of the orders. I'm in customer service and understand busy times but apologies go a long way during busy times.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80e96aaab11283e9:0x961ee265a173fec2< /Gmap_id><Date>1420142960121<//Date>< UserId.>

<date>1324312309830<//date><Rating>1</Rating><text>Half-way through a stack of pancakes I found a whole one-inch insect cooked into my food.  I don't see how they missed that while cooking it. Totally unacceptable for any restaurant.  Walked out after asking for the manager and being told he wouldn't be in for over an hour. Do not go to this restaurant!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80e96aaab11283e9:0x961ee265a173fec2< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Terrible cook. Used to be my favorite IHOP. Bacon temptation omlette had about 6 bacon bits in it and no melted cheese whatsoever, in addition to being
so dry and tasteless.< /review>

<review>Today v had been in the morning to this particular IHOP. For breakfast. As we walked in the guy standing at the station asked for the number of people? Without greeting then directed us to the server who did not even notice us and picked up the menu and started walking towards the seating area.  She was so disrespectful that we have to assume that we are led by her towards the seating area.  While standing B4 we cd take our seats she is asking us what we would like us to drink ?? Again unprofessional.. then after bringing the drinks asked us for the order to eat !! When I said oatmeal with fruits,  she did not hear it properly instead of asking politely she said "what" ?? As there was a  background noise of some children I thought I sh say it loudly so I repeated the order.. then she is saying to me that should lower my volume !! Then why the hell in the first place u did not hear ?? I lost my patience.. called the manager he was trying to make things up !! By saying he would talk to her and see why it happen .. I strongly recommend that pl be aware of this particular location is not appropriate in service point of view.. hate to see people are being so unprofessional.,< /review><user_name>Jyoti Suresh< /user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Prices are extremely high! 2x2x2 (2 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 pancakes) with coffee was over  $14! The food was good as was the service, but paying that much is ridiculous.</text>
