These guys are awesome!!!! They installed a touch screen and a complete alarm system on my 2012 Nissan Frontier at a very reasonable price.  They are very professional and courteous and friendly.  I will definitely go back to them for my car needs .</text>

Mike at the Stereo center provided me with the perfect stereo.  I forgot to ask for an aux outlet and thank goodness he picked one with that accessory for my daughter's music wants.  Installation was quick and expertly done.  I will be back to get my doors powered so I can have
easy entry to my truck.  Thanks!< /text>

<Review>This place over charged me on a viper security system. Made me pay $200 for a $60 product. Then they do very poor work. I asked them to install my stereo system correctly and they left everything as it was originally. If you value quality work then this is not the place to go!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Everything is all about negotiation and every sales person there is different. You need to go there knowing what most things cost to make sure you don't get ripped off. Make sure they give you an itemized list of what each item costs. They usually just give you a total. What I am not pleased with is this. I brought my brand new Tundra in to have my stereo installed. The seat belt harness was not retracting well once I picked up my truck. Didn't think installing a stereo system would affect that, so I brought it back to Toyota to have them fix the problem. We found out that the guys installing the stereo, wrapped the excess cables around my seat belt mechanism inside the plastic frame of the truck. That pissed me off. They are obviously not professionals since they made one of the most important safety features on my truck malfunction. BEWARE!!!<//review>

This place will screw you any chance they get. I have been a loyal customer for a long time but they screwed me by charging a customer 1000$ less then they charged me for the same exact system. They had better installers a few years ago now the installers are all crappy just gets u in and get u out. They are such scum bags. There are way better places to get a good product and not worry about getting screwed. Do your research before you shop here.< /Text>

They quoted me one price over the phone and in person, for a Viper alarm system. They ended up installing a cheap version and when I question the guy, he tells me its just as good as Viper. Half way through the installation they tell me they have to add additional parts/equipment. The price quickly went up another $200. Stay away from this place. They will take advantage of you.<//review>

Prices are not the best. But can work with you. They will try to rip you off if you don't know how to work with them. Might try to sell you extra things you don't need instead of fixing what you actually need. But quality items and variety. Just have to know what you are talking about and what you actually need.</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>Worst stereo install I have ever encountered.

I took my car apart to put new component speakers in the front doors, and seeing what these guys did to my car is dispicable. Absolutely trash.
I don’t understand how you guys are still open.

Do us all a favor and close down your shop so you don’t screw up anyone else’s vehicle.</review><name>bailey Schooler< /name>< GmapID>

These guys are extremely nice, but they 're prices are outrageous. They prey on the ignorance of their customers so they can double the cost of their products to offer "free installations". They were charging 1000.00 for a pair of speakers you can buy anywhere else for 499.00. An amplifier that retails for 399.00 for 1000.00 and a Pioneer AVH7800BT that can be purchased for 399, they were selling for 699 but it came with "free installation".

They will be happy to sell you a crappy amp and speakers for over retail pricing and tell you its a great deal. I went twice and each time I walked away.

If you want a good group of guys that will give you a solid deal, head on over to Car Audio Pros. They may not have the best selection, but they can get you anything you want.</text>

<time>1372815666358< /time><Rating>3< /Rating><text>I went to Stereo Center on 07-01-2013 at approximately 1700 hours to purchase a radio for my old pick up truck. It is a Brazilian salesman and a Muslim owned shop. I found the people pleasant. I just wanted a fair deal on a car stereo, nothing fancy just a stereo and a couple of speakers. A Pioneer DEH-4500BT was the recommended stereo head and a couple of Rockford Fosgate Punch P1692 6x9 spkrs. I took them at their word for the "Free" installation and a decent price. When I got home I noticed that there was not any listed price on my receipt for the components, just one total price of $420.00. I thought this was rater odd so in an effort to see how much each item cost me I went to the web and OMG, the Pioneer cost $96.00 on Amazon and almost anywhere else, and the speakers were a whopping $60.00, for a grand total of $167.00 in components. This is $253.00 LESS than the $420.00 I was charged. Tomorrow we talk about what was a reasonable labor charge and then they can have their equipment back.
Today is 07-02-2013. I went over to Stereo Center today after work and asked to speak with yesterdays salesman. I told him that I liked him but I did not like the excess charge for my equipment. I eventually pitched my complaint to who I presume is the owner. He said he could not compete with an internet site and his mark up on the unit was $29.00. The speakers were a push and the wiring harness was $45.00. Minus the tax and I was charged $45.00 for labor. I told him that the installation labor was supposed to be for free, and he confirmed it with the salesman and offered to return my overcharge. Then he offered me a new set of rear speakers to cover the charge and I accepted. I was watching when the rear speakers were being installed and they were some brand I never heard of and certainly were not the Rockford Fosgates like in the front. I told him to reinstall my stock speakers back in the rear and give me my money. He capitulated and installed the matching Rockford Fosgate speakers in the rear and it was done. I am okay with this, but remember not everybody eyeballs the process like myself.</text>< Pics>

dont ever go to a horrifying place like this. these arabs try there sneaky little ways to lie to get you to buy something. For Example, I Got a New Car and needed Tinted windows, well this place advertises alot about there products so i gave it a shot. While there, i already felt a bad vibe about that place, then comes a arab and i let him know what im shopping for, anyways he shows me the tint shades, and honestly this is exactly what he states ""It does not Matter what Shade you Pick, all the shades are the same price, What matters is the "QUALITY" you get with us is what matters"" So unsmart me beleives this fool. I pick the Medium Quality which was going to be around 279$! just for the 3 back windows. Low Q was 179$ Med Q was 279$ and High Q was 379 he stated. Well Guess what, I purchased the Medium Quality, and my Appointment was the Next Day. I went the Next Day and the Previous guy that i had was not there anymore, this time it was another arab, I asked him, You know what Quality it is right (because it didnt state on the receipt) and he said yes... Again i asked him "You know what Level of Quality it is Right..." and Now he stated there was only One Quality!! IM LIKE WTF. We Faught for a REFUND But he DENIED and Did not REFUND Me...

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>This place is a joke!!! went in to purchase a dvd player and 2 monitors and I paid over a 100% mark up, and these guys clearly dont know how to do math after giving me an itemized total of everything the guy at the counter tried to add another 70 bucks on top of the price(good thing I can do math). He also recommended that I get a video amplifier since I was going to have multiple screens, great call; but not for 175.00 these are 50.00 tops. now I'll go on to the installers, before these guys even started on my truck I drew a picture and explained exactly how I wanted my setup, after doing it three times the wrong way it was like I was talking rocket science to these guys. when I got home I had one bad screen and it was still hooked up wrong! There was a huge hole in the dash cubby with melted plastic everywhere. When
I got back to the shop I basically supervised the install to make sure it was finally done correctly and still have a huge hole in my dash, with no attempt on there part to fix the problem, instead I was told they are professionals that do hundreds of installs a week. I feel bad for those people and hope anyone who is thinking about going to the stereo center READS THIS POST!!! these guys are anything but professional.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Pierre was my barber. Subpar cut. Uneven and not unstylish, will need to get it done again. Barbers were chatting the entire time and didn't seem to be paying much attention. Took twice as long as it should have. Barber didn't seem to have a steady hand and was unenthused when I asked for him to redo parts<//Review>< pictures>

Fantastic service! Booked online for a heart trim and haircut with Mike. It was great to walk into a room with good energy and positive chatter between all the employees. The place is cash only but the on-site ATM is pretty cheap ($1.50 per transaction in addition to whatever your financial institution charges). I will definitely be back because my haircut and beard trim was superlative!< /text>

< review>
I got a decent cut here, but I will never be going back again. They asked me to make a reservation beforehand with a specific staff member, so I went online to their website and did so. I arrived right on time for my reservation, but somebody who came in 5 minutes before me WITHOUT a reservation apparently got priority over my reservation and got his haircut with my assigned staff member. I ended up waiting 25 minutes until it was my turn.  Also, prices are ridiculous for the service you receive. I paid $65 + tip for a mediocre haircut.  Oh, and they don't accept cash but do have an ATM inside their store(get with the times, just get an ipad and a Square account - even most food trucks accept cards these days). So if you don't have cash, expect to pay an additional $3 withdrawal fee because it's one of those miscellaneous non-bank-affiliated ATMs.< /review>

<review>My brother attended Norwalk HS and played on their football team. I had many opportunities to frequent Excelsior Stadium.
The bathrooms are adequate nothing great, but the stadium has no parking. I usually parked across the street, but parking can be tricky during busy games and for the graduation ceremony. The security is usually adequate. I am happy that my brother recently graduated and I will no longer be going to this venue.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7QMDEw5xQ3ATOpevUUS1vubMDeS8upysF-TxW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbqLO6iknVVmjpQZuoXKQfzLelJviDmoGl3iOm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3CdIi2s3k6ZIBGtWDM2pr8bP_KE_9OVIEdvdZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoAIN-CNnrIUj0wGB_UaBYCX6wRuITLCtK5FBu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO98BB2amoS99OsQOfKPHrudVTkhlPSEc_jysyU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgsrwAFFLG-83Oo8NSbtLsOXgK-OVsKzZjfQC-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a comfortable place for some sports such as walking, running, going up and down the stairs, playing futball, etc. I recommend it quietly. The only drawback is that some people take their dogs and they do pupu and they do not clean it and it has already happened to me without stopping me in a pupu and it is ante-hygienic

(Original)
Es un lugar cómodo para algunos deportes tales como caminar, correr, subir y bajar las escaleras, jugar futball etc  tranquilamente yo lo recomiendo. El único inconveniente es que algunas personas llevan sus perros y se hacen pupu y no lo limpian y ya me ha pasado sin darme cta pararme en un pupu y es antehigienico<//text>< Date>

I simply love this place. They look at you individually and give you more than just a message.

Trish focused on the main problems but took care of my rest as well.

Overall, great place. The massage therapist that I saw was incredible. She knew exactly pressure and release. Going back soon.</review>

Tough choice to rate this place as low as 3 stars. To start off with the pros - the studio is very well decorated, staff were attentive, and overall amazing ambiance! They serve you tea and snacks before and after your treatment. However, the main con - the massage and the facial treatment. They recommend you bring in all of the face products you use so they can tailor the facial to your skin needs and based on what you use daily, which didn’t happen at all. The “facial” is simple and felt good but don’t expect much more than an essential oil spread on your face. On to the massage, if you’re someone that enjoys light touching, not a lot of pressure, and a massage that won’t leave you sore for days (or feeling any different from when you walked in) - this place is it! If you’re someone that enjoys more painful massage where they are working on your pain points and you want to feel like a new person the next day - this place isn’t that. During my couples massage, my masseuse asked how the pressure was and I had asked for harder pressure but didn’t get that.

Kind of bummed to leave a somewhat negative review as I was hoping to love it and thought about getting a membership with them but don’t think I’ll be back. Over $400 for light touching isn’t worth it.< /review>

Your couples massage included an add-on called the Facial Rejuvenation, which is facial massage and acupressure. My apologies this wasn't clear for you. Regarding the massage, I understand that the pressure wasn't adequate for your taste. Our therapists are highly skilled in deep tissue massage and always aim to work safely and effectively with each unique client. The goal is never to leave anyone in pain.

< Review>
Massage services and the massage therapists are quite nice. But ambiance gets 0 stars. It's impossible to fully disconnect when the treatment room is on street level on Laguna, where there's a constant flow of vehicle and foot traffic. The music over the speakers went out twice in our room before my massage therapist just went and got her phone as a stand in. Despite the music, you can still hear traffic outside, neighbors who live upstairs entering the building, and the din of staff chatting in the lobby area. The business is a tiny space, with the paper thin walls of classic SF homes. They do their best for a small business, but at their prices for a sub-optimal experience ($650 for a 2hr couple's treatment), we'll opt for a proper big name spa next time with more amenities and a guaranteed relaxing environment.</Review>

Have so enjoyed my two facials with Ravi. The products feel and smell lovely. When she massages in the anti-aging formula for the face it is so relaxing I may go to sleep. The many hot towels and hot hand treatments are an added bonus. I will definitely return!< /text>

Really enjoyed my facial with Margo, and my boyfriend loved his massage with Anna. The front desk girls are also SO nice and helpful. I really appreciated them and their help on booking my appointments. My only thing- I wish they had more co-ed spaces!! I came with my boyfriend and we were separated while relaxing in the sauna and hot tubs. I wish they had a least one hot tub/sauna that could be shared!</Review>

<review>I have been to Trisha multiple times for both facials and body massage. Trisha has magical healing hands that combine her many years of expertise and training from all over the world. I was particularly taken aback by the integration of both Eastern and Western modalities, which makes her body work unique, deeply soothing and healing. You really do feel zen after any treatment and at one with your mind, body and soul. I would highly recommend Trisha for both facials and massage!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Girlfriend and I checked in for an hour long couples massage for my birthday. From the moment we walked in we could feel ourselves decompress. The reception room sets the right tone inviting a quiet ease. We were served water and tea and introduced to the two women that would be working on us. They were friendly, caring and professional, listened to our needs, and checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. Afterward we were offered more tea and water, a light snack, and I was even given a lovely scroll with a special birthday message for me.</review><user_id>117028639005403816115<//user_id>< date>

<text>Earthbody is my favorite place to go when I want to be completely nurtured.

First thing I notice when I get there is the ambiance. The decor is warm and pretty and a nice mixture of Moroccan inspired against the backdrop of San Francisco Victorian. The waiting room is a cozy space where you can relax, enjoy some books, drink some water, it's a really nice place to be.

Second, there is the exceptional professionalism of the staff. Someone will warmly greet you. The massage therapist will have a nice conversation with you about what you're hoping to get out of the massage, any pains, you have, etc. It's the conversation that pretty much all massage therapists have or should have before a treatment, but my experience with Earthbody therapists has always been top notch. The warmth, nurturing, and professionalism in their communications really shines through.

Third, the quality of the treatments. I've been here at least a half a dozen times. All of the massages I've experienced have been top quality. Great technique and very relaxing experience.

Last, there is usually a nice little send-off for you at the end. They might give you a little card on what do after your massage and a glass of water to drink and sometimes a little bite of chocolate or nuts/dried fruit to eat and you're back sitting in the lovely little waiting room and able to just regroup before you head back out to busy San Francisco.

Overall I highly recommend Earthbody.<//text>< Pictures>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Earthbody is a sweet little place and I have enjoyed being a member for many years. I recommend checking it out! However, if you are considering membership - I offer this feedback since I recently canceled my membership. The last few years, they have raised the price each year. It is increasingly difficult to find appointments (note: your aren't able to use your membership on weekends). Massage therapists are constantly in flux. As soon as I find someone I connect with, he/she leaves. I always booked my appointments 1-2 months since my schedule can be tricky. Every month, I could count on a phone call asking me to change it "to accommodate their schedule." And more than anything, after being a loyal customer for many years and referring several others there, I don't feel like a valued customer. It's unfortunate. I will still go but less frequently and am looking forward to trying out other places in the city.< /text>< Rate>

The moment I walked into Earthbody, I felt more relaxed. The ambiance of the lobby itself transports you out of the bustling city and into a sanctuary (with only occasional noise from the street). I've had prenatal massages, ground massages, and inspired massages. They have all be wonderful! I loved my experience so much that I signed up for their membership to *force* myself to get a monthly massage. I've experienced 4 therapists, all very skilled. During each visit you fill out a form about preferences/ needs for that session which is very helpful with communicating to the therapist. I can't wait to book my next massage.</text>

Earthbody Day Spa is an incredible experience. Organic handcrafted products are used in the massage sessions; these oils, balms and scrubs are available at the spa and online for in-home use. I have the entire line, I guess you could say I'm a true devotee. Recently, I tried The Winter Ritual - so wonderful! I loved the jute dry brush; it really felt good and invigorating and I had never had anything like that before. The massage was so relaxing and the salt scrub after that was the perfect ending. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Earthbody!< /Text>

<Text>Girlfriend and I checked in for an hour long couples massage for my birthday. From the moment we walked in we could feel ourselves decompress. The reception room sets the right tone inviting a quiet ease. We were served water and tea and introduced to the two women that would be working on us. They were friendly, caring and professional, listened to our needs, and checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. Afterward we were offered more tea and water, a light snack, and I was even given a lovely scroll with a special birthday message for me. This was the perfect cap to a romantic birthday staycation.Thank you Earth Body!<//Text>< Rate>

<text>I just experienced the Spring Ritual that Earthbody offers and couldn't have been more pleased.  The entire experience from start to finish was wonderful.  The waiting room is very warm and inviting.  When I arrived for my appointment there was a tray with hot tea, a warm towel and an envelope with a meditation written in it.  The actual treatment itself was so relaxing and centering.  It was very clear that the whole experience was meant to be a holistic one - one that balances both the external and internal body.  I left feeling realigned in my emotions as well as the physical body.  But more than anything I love the products because they are entirely organic and made from only plant oils so that you know what you are putting on your body is completely pure.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<username>Paulo Jay Dumlao< /username><date>1406734248668< /date><rating>5<//rating><text>They have a great atmosphere and the customer service is excellent! Their facility is a little small, but I guess it keeps for an intimate spa experience. From start to finish, they treat with exceptional care, and provide you with a drink that helps calm you before your treatment. The only (minor) drawback is that if you have a street facing room, you can hear the occasional car drive by.

Overall, I had a great experience and cannot wait to go back!

Great atmosphere. Great massages and therapists. Can be a bit noisy with street traffic on Laguna and neighbors walking up and down the stairs in the building next door. Membership is good, although you can't use it on the weekends which can be annoying at times. Their therapists rotate often so it's difficult to maintain relationships overtime.<//review>

<Review>Earthbody is my gift to myself.  A good friend introduced me to it a couple of years ago and as they say the rest is history.  I so appreciate that it is a total experience.  From the minute I enter the space everything, from the warm tones of the decor to the scent of herbs in the air, sends me into immediate relaxation mode.  I've had four massages with four different therapists and each was amazing.  I always leave feeling lighter in body and spirit.</Review>< gmap_id>

Earthbody is the best! They are my favorite place to get a massage in the Bay Area. I love the peaceful atmosphere, and the rituals before and after your massage. The staff and massage therapists are warm and well-trained. I also enjoy the organic products they use. Come here to get your bliss on!</text>

<Text>I'm a huge fan of Earthbody Day Spa. It's an experience that stays with you long after your treatment ends. The best part about getting a facial there is the mini massage. I had a facial with Max and he's awesome! He has an extremely gentle touch when it comes to the facial with the right amount of pressure for the massage. I highly recommend both Earthbody and Max!</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I have been visiting Earthbody for 2 amazing years. Each month, as I park my car nearby I am so excited that I am literally skipping down the street.  As I enter the front door, it is always with a warm greeting, tea and a note of shared wisdom. An hour or an hour and a half later I am in a perfect state of mind and body. Throughout each month when I think of my upcoming visit I feel more balanced. For me, it is as if the day-to-day stresses I/we face become less. My favorite therapist is Tanya. She is always able to sense where I need focus; leaving me rejuvenated, relaxed and re-energized.<//Review>

<Text>Extremely calming and relaxing as soon as you walk through the door. My two friends and I were greeted with tea and a small mixtures of delicious and healthy fruit and nuts. My friends took me for my birthday and they gave me a great inspiring quote that I have tacked to my wall.

Great customer service and attention to detail from beginning to end. I greatly appreciated the cleanliness of it as well. The masseuse was very professional and I left feeling completely relaxed and my body felt so much less tight.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A spiritual experience... these massages are like nothing I've experienced before. I've been going to EB a few times a year since they moved to their location on Laguna Street. Every practitioner has been fantastic and every massage is unique. They have incredible technique and a holistic approach.

I love all of the special touches they add to the experience, scented oils, hot towels, tea, more. It's truly a ritual.<//Text><userid>106721761379419238747< /userid><user_name>niki castello</user_name><Gmap_id>0x808580a247e7acd5:0xbaee6a58e779eaad</Gmap_id>< Pics>

My fiance and I came here for a couple's massage for our anniversary and it was AMAZING! They begin by letting you relax in the lobby with some floral tea and a hot towel. Then you move onto the heated beds for your massage. During the massage, I really appreciated how attentive they were in making sure the pressure was okay. When coming to a knot or a tense spot, they focused more attention to working it out. In addition, you can tell that they use high quality, great smelling lotions and oils.

Afterward, I felt euphoric and highly recommend it to anyone in SF looking for a good masseuse.

It's a little pricey for me, which is why I only go back on special occasions.</text>

As a serious massage consumer, I have to say Earthbody Day Spa was definitely one of the best if not THE BEST spa experience I've had. I had no expectations and was just blown away by how peaceful and customized the treatments felt. I did get a package (which is always nice) but the practitioners were kind, attentive, skilled and very professional. I found the environment 100% nurturing and peaceful which is such a treasure. I highly recommend that you try this place on and surely hope that you drop into the bliss I experienced there.< /Text>

Earthbody is my go-to spot for a relaxing, transcending massage experience. Scarlett is amazing, and I always come out feeling at peace, body and mind. Their massages are phenomenal, their handmade products are also so moisturizing and natural. And the little tea or snack at the beginning and end of your appointment is a very nice touch.<//Review>

From the moment I walked into Earthbody, I felt relaxed, transported to a tranquil serene place. While slightly older, the lobby area is well-appointed with comfortable seating and soft lighting.

My therapist met me with some delicious tea and walked me back to the treatment room. While the building and the room are obviously old, that did not detract from the peaceful space the team at Earthbody had created. Moreover, my massage was amazing. One of the best I've ever had.

The therapist, Brittany, talked through her "findings" which I found incredibly helpful. She wasn't just giving me a massage, she was treating the issues/pain/knots she discovered.

Afterwards, I enjoyed more tea and a nice snack of dried fruit and nuts. It was so nice to be able to sit and relax a little longer before entering back into the real world.

I will definitely be back!<//text>

Earthbody is a relaxing sanctuary that instantly transforms your mind and body into a mecca of heavenly scents and unprecedented healing treatments. I'm a long time client and feel like I'm arriving home every time I come in for sessions. The products are vegan, organic, and delicious. I use EB products every single day. I enjoy the soothing fragrance of Dream body oil and the Purify face cleanser (to name a few). Earthbody has the most mindful founder you'll ever meet. Denmo is an incredible support system as a holistic coach. I've been a client for 4 years and she still ceases to amaze me!< /review>

I am frequent visitor to Earthbody and I can't say enough about how wonderful it is. The therapists are very nurturing and experienced. I recently tried their new Winter Ritual and it was exactly what I needed. It was the perfect combination of a revitalizing body treatment and massage to cure the fall/winter blues. I love that they make their own products (that you can also buy) with preservatives and additives. A+++</Text>

<review>Earthbody Day Spa creates an environment that transports you to your own inner sanctuary from the moment you step inside their doorway. I have had 3 different massage therapists and each one has listened carefully to my likes/dislikes and adapted their approach. A post treatment tea, nuts and snacks in addition to a debriefing by the practitioner rounds out the experience. A sensory feast in every way.</review><Date>1410971685951< /Date>< Pictures>

I love Earthbody! I am part of the monthly membership program and have the luxury of massages every month. Each of the massage therapists are fantastic, the front desk is professional, and the interior of the spa is so relaxing. Truly a bright spot in my month!<//text>

<review>Earthbody is a gem. The practitioners are all gifted (it's obvious that Earthbody standards are incredibly high). The physical space is all peace and tranquility--the perfect antidote to the harried life outside. Just thinking about an upcoming treatment calms me down. And I always look forward to reading Denmo's blogs!<//review>< time>

< Review>
A massage at Earthbody is not just a massage, it's an incredible experience from start to finish.  As I arrive I feel the sanctuary around me and expanding from within. I sit down in the comfy lounge area and receive the tray containing a delicious cup of tea, a warm lemon scented cloth to begin the process of washing away the worries of the day and am inspired by the inspirational quote, which is also fun to unfold and keep as a souvenir. I spend a few minutes with my therapist discussing any issues I might have and the tailored journey has begun!  The massage is of course pure bliss.  And afterwards, a nice tall glass of water and some dried fruits and nuts help me get over the fact that I can't stay here forever.  Another chat with my therapist about how everything went and how I feel now.  A stop at the front desk to make my next appointment, and I am walking out the door, sad to leave, but happy to be able to take the experience with me and savor it on my way home...</Review>

Adriene is amazing at both massage and facials. She alerted me to a suspicious dot (about the size of the head of a pin) on my cheek which turned out to be a basal cell carcinoma (cancer that needed immediate treatment!) Essentially Addy saved my cheekbone/face! And the products she makes are incredibly indulgent and you can feel safe knowing they are made with the finest ingredients because she is so aware of the power of natural products/essential elements. The spa environment is quite soothing as well.<//Review>

I LOVE Earthbody.  I saw Rachel after being in a bad car accident that had caused me severe tension in my shoulders.  She made me feel so much better, and the whole experience was extremely calming.  They really take the whole hour to ensure they hit any sore muscle, and discuss what you are looking for . They also serve you a bit of tea after which I felt was nice.  I enjoy you aren't ushered out immediately.  I definitely recommend a visit here!< /Text>

Earth Body is a wonderful day spa for tired minds and sore muscles. I've only been once but the experience was even better than what I expected. The massage is amazing and you feel truly rested and relaxed afterwards. I plan to take my husband there first chance I get!< /Review>

I often wish that I was closer and didn't live in San Jose so that I could visit here more frequently.  I got a massage a while back and it was one of the most relaxing and beneficial sessions of bodywork I have ever had.  They have very reasonable prices as well.  I will be back whenever I visit SF.< /review>

<Review>So, lately, I have been wanting more of 2 things in my life; Connection to my body and connection to others.  I went to Earthbody and had Keely for the Pranayama Spring Ritual massage treatment.  I just looked up pranayama, it means extension of the life force.  What was cool about this massage was that Keely brought in 4 different types of breathing exercises (lasting from 30 seconds to as long as it felt good to me) during different times of the treatment.  Normally I would think to myself, "um, I just want to lie here and have my massage therapist give me my massage".  But the incorporation of my breath during the massage gave me more of a connection/awareness to my body during the massage.  Then I proceeded to go to a pretty relaxed place where I ended up slipping into sleep (something I never do for the first time with a new masseuse).  Keely guided me through the breathing exercises.  I felt supported and didn't feel resistance about jumping into a new breathing ritual during a massage.  So I received the two things (increased connection to others and my body) I had been yearning for, in this one Spring Ritual massage.  I also received different oil treatments and a sea salt back scrub.  Two birds.  One stone.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I've been following Earthbody since the spa was just a couple of cozy rooms on Linden St.  (Was it Linden?)

I received a few regular massages from Denmo before my other expenses increased and I had to cut massages out of my budget. =( Denmo was an amazing healer with a grounding presence.  Though she is no longer available for bodywork, I highly recommend that you sign up for her newsletter.

I hope to have a membership here soon!<//Review><UserId.>100608099234238835686</UserId.>< date>

Turns out, the reviewers were correct. Earthbody was a wonderful and relaxing experience.

<Text>My partner and I are always excited to find a spa that is so fun, professional and staffed with the best therapists. We always make a point to book a service whenever we are coming to the city. We expect the best, and have found it.. In our past, we both worked @ Meadowood as therapists, and later @ Two Bunch Palms and most recently @ The Rviera in Palm Springs . Our expectations are high, and always are surpassed. Thank you for being there. Robert and Kenn</Text>< Pics>

An ayurvedic oasis with a great selection of holistic care products. The vibe is serene and services professional, but leans on the hippie-dippie side. If you're into more 'clinical' type of spas, this is probably not the best fit for you!<//text>

I was buying a gift card from across the country, for a west coast friend, and the staff made it super easy and convenient for me.  My friend loved the massage and I'll definitely be getting more gifts from here soon!< /Review>

Calm is palpable at Earthbody. I crave it! Denmo is an inspiring teacher and healer and I am so grateful for her support in my path. The staff at Earthbody is kind and patient, and invested in patients' wellbeing.<//Text>

<Review>I happened to come across Earthbody with Yelp and it started really good but something SOUR happened at the end which made a bad impression. Me and my husband got the Couples Essentials which is a 1 hour couples massage with one ritual of your choice. Clearly noted on the website and in the appointment confirmation I received from them. We got Ginky and Zeek as therapist and Ginky who did mines was great but my husband said Zeek was okay. GINKY worked really hard and worked on all parts of my body (THANKS GINKY). AFTER WE WERE DONE WITH THE MASSAGE I ASKED THE RECEPTIONIST ABOUT THE RITUAL BECAUSE I WAS EXCITED TO GET A FOOT STONE THERAPY. SHE THEN TELLS ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT THIS WAS INCLUDED IN THE BEGINNING.  WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU? YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. SHE DENIED ALL THINGS. I SHOWED HER MY EMAIL AND SHE JUST SAID WHEN I COME IN NEXT TIME THEY WILL DO IT COMPLIMENTARY. THEN SHE TOLD THAT I WASN'T OVERPAYING BECAUSE ONLY THE MASSAGE  IS A PART OF THE $330 THAT I PAYED. WOW HUH? I THEN SHOWED HER THE WEBSITE WHICH SAYS THAT IT IS INCLUDED SO SHE SAYS THAT LET ME GO TALK TO THE MANAGER. SHE GOES AND COMES BACK TO TELL ME THAT "IT WAS INCLUDED AND THEY DID THE HOT TOWEL NECK THERAPY. " LIKE REALLY YOU AS THE RECEPTIONIST  DIDN'T KNOW THIS? SHE DENIED IT SO MANY TIMES AND I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG. THE THERAPISTS DIDN'T ASK US WHAT WE WANTED. THEY JUST DECIDED. $0 TIP AND NEVER GOING BACK.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Apparently I have back muscles that can stop a bullet from penetrating right through me. Wow, I knew I was tense but...that definitely puts things into perspective.

I've always suffered back and neck pains because, well, I'm a very tense person, even when I'm happy. Go figure. Some people tell me I need to get laid more often, but I think that's just TMI.

Anywho, I went in for the "Unravel" 2 hour long massage. It was at 9:00AM on a Sunday morning and I barely made it because I usually start waking up around that time. I was greeted with a nice warm towel, which I used to soak up the nasty rain from outside and delicious tea.

Sarah was my awesome masseuse and after asking me some questions, she went right to work. The massage oils that she used smelled WONDERFUL. Way better and not nauseating like other ones used at other places.

She said I had some pretty impressive back muscles, much tighter than some CEO clients she's worked on. She wanted to do a deep tissue massage but couldn't stick a finger through my muscles. Bad muscles, stop behaving!!!

The whole ordeal was painful for me because my entire body is very tense. I asked her how people can sleep through this. She worked on my head, neck, back, shoulders, and legs. Whole body treatment. It was torture I admit, but it felt good as well. I felt spasms throughout my back which I'm assuming means my muscles were trying to relax. I'm still sore while I'm writing this but my back does feel better. Sarah really knew what she was doing and what locations to concentrate on the most. Oh, and more tea was served after the treatment. Definitely would recommend this place.

PS. The Milk facial cleanser is AWWWWMAZINGGGG. I almost ate it when I put it on my face.

PSS. It's time to finally take some yoga classes</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808580a247e7acd5:0xbaee6a58e779eaad</gmapID></record>

I found Earthbody through a Groupon, and was delighted. I still carry one of Kathryn's cards around me in case I run into someone who wants a massage recommendation in that area of SF. I moved up to Sonoma county, but I still keep my eyes out for specials that make it worth planning other city biz into a self-care date at Earthbody.

The only reason I knocked off a star is that I think they could offer more/better options for cleaning up afterwards if you get one of the oil-intensive Ayurvedic style massages (which are AWESOME!). My pipedream would be having an actual shower to wash my hair. Of course this doesn't matter if you actually live in the city and can go home right after.< /text>

I adore this place! They prepare delicious meals, they have a nice menu, The chief cook in that spot is a professional, I love very much trying all their dishes. The food is always tasty, the service towards the guests  is helpful. I frequently visit this restaurant and I was never disappointed. I recommend it to all.<//review>

Was a little disappointed my pinakbet was supposed to be chicken slices but it was definitely pork slices, I couldn’t eat it, so went to waste. I ordered lumpia there was not a lot of fillings at all,  the fried chicken was good though.</text>

<Review>The price matches the portions of food they give you. I was craving some good lechon and this satisfied my cravings. The kare kare was also incredibly good, but the pancit wasn’t the best which is why I gave 4/5 stars. I would definitely buy the lechon again.<//Review>< userid>

Hello fellow foodies, not real enthused with this place, yet keeping it real once again....

Came in for breakfast with the fam this morning after reading their reviews on Google and Yelp.

Initially observed they could have turned up their airconditioner a bit, it would be more comfortable in there. Considering it was a hot and exceptionally humid morning that extra cooling would have been appreciated.

In all fairness, the food was okay with particular emphasis and kudos on the thinly fried fish referred to as "jeprox". Real satisfying with garlic rice.

The "longanisa" was well seasoned and cooked quite well. Goes down real easy too.

A little dissapointed with the preparation of their "tocino", fried chicken, and adobo as they appeared undercooked and cold. Just couldn't handle more than two or three bites.  (...however in the spirit of fairness, the food looked appetizing in the  warmer.)

I really believe once they get their act together, this place definitely  has tremendous potential.

I will give Bamboo Bistro another try in a few months, and trust that appropriate changes will be made to secure and lock in my business.

See you guys then, I know you can do it guys! See you in a few months.

<text>Budol "fight" style.  Dont let that intimate you. First off, all "dry" food are laid out neatly in the middle of a table covered with banana leaves. If you order saucy or soupy food, it will of course be on a bowl. No utensils unless requested.  The "fight" comes when you sit down and start serving yourself the most delicious Filipino comfort food. There's a convenient sink to wash your hands first.
This is the 2nd Budol fight style restaurant ive been too.  But this one does not need prepaid reservation. Just order off the menu and Happy eating and happy belly!< /text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I've been here before for events with the family. It's kind of our go-to place when we dont want to cook Filipino food and worry about clean up afterwards. It's in a interesting location surrounded by Mexican restaurants and stores but it's been going strong within the community for a while and I hope it stays that way.

What's great about Bamboo Bistro is their sense of camaraderie and heritage for Filipino culture. They have karaoke nights, show Filipino television shows and they have "Kamayan" which is the traditional way of eating Filipino food; with your hands.

You don't have to speak tagalog to eat here either, you usually can just point at what looks good and it'll come with a side of rice. Just be weary if you're on a diet since Filipino food is like the Soul Food of Asia.

They also do catering orders *cash only*<//Review>

<Review>Really good Filipino food at very reasonable prices. They also have a buffet during weekend mornings and afternoon. Parking is a pain though and it can be crowded during weekend evenings as they have karaoke and/or singers at those nights, particularly on Saturdays. Of course, you can always go a la carte.

If you do go, try the beef sinigang, crispy pata, and the kare-kare. For appetizers get the fried calamari or lechon kawali.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c290d233691303:0x5d0edc5538f824be< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They used to have a great customer service! Now they are rude especially when ordering for pick up! Been a loyal customer but they start being rude to calls! Food is good but hospitality wise, they are bad to it!!!!!!!</Text>

I don't usually text while at a restaurant or a comedy show let alone go online to review the place...but here I am doing BOTH at the same time. I haven't tried their full menu yet but their adobo rice is incredible both by itself as well as personalized. The flavors are absolutely incredible together!</review>

<Review>Hands down the best Filipino food in the area!!! You can experience the traditional filipino boodle fight, also known as "kamayan" which is a meal where banana leaves are laid out on the table and the food place down the center, and shared among the party, making it a real communal experience. They also have breakfast and lunch buffets on the weekends which provide an exceptional value for all you can eat Filipino food (I believe $9 for breakfast and $12 for lunch, I know they just increased the price on this recently).  My favorite dishes here are the Adobo Fried Rice and Pork Liempo, but every dish I've had here has been pretty damn delicious!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

We just wanted to say thank you to the entire staff who help us celebrate my Father In-laws 75th birthday at bamboo Bistro (last Saturday), and Congratulations to the owner for having such a good and honest employee. For returning valuable items that we forgot after the party, bless your heart and more success to come. Definitely we are going to come back in this place for our future family event. “Special thanks to”  Dan, George & Bo you did a great Job!  #goodfood#entertaiment#niceplace :)<//Review>

<text>Although I have known about this restaurant for more than a year, this was our first time eating at this restaurant. We decided to eat Kamayan style which is the Filipino tradition of eating with your hands.

With Kamayan style, they basically lay banana leaves on the table and they put your food on top of the banana leaves. You use your hands to eat your food. Of course, you cant eat soup with your hands so they do provide you a bowl and a spoon for the soup. We ordered Kare-Kare, Crispy Pata, Talipia, Squid and a couple of other dishes. They were all good!
However, it does take a while to cook the dishes so if you are planning to eat Kamayan style, I would suggest you order before you come in or plan to wait 20-25 minutes for your food to be ready.

The location of the restaurant is in an odd place. It is in a shopping center surrounded by mostly Mexican businesses. It is the only Filipino business in the shopping center.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Always a fantastic experience at this place.  Delicious pizzas, pastas, salads, and appetizers.  The manager is wonderful, always so friendly and knows his regular customers by name.  Love the fact that prices are reasonable and they are always offering various coupons and other deals.  Have been going here for years and will continue to do so!< /text>

<Review>This has been our go to for inexpensive pizza for a few years now but tonight we have been waiting for two and a half hours and have been told 3 times in the last 45min that it was on the way.  We live 10-15min away at best. When I called they didn't even have an excuse like " we are short handed" or "we have been very busy tonight" all they would say is "sorry, it's on the way".  So I don't know, I guess only order if you aren't hungry.

*EDITE* after another half hour I was told they don't know what happened and said they were going to make a new one at 9:40pm. I asked what they are going to offer in order to "make good" on the situation. I was told that I could have a cookie or a refund. I took the refund, I didn't want to wait who knows how many more hours. They don't seem to deliver on there own anymore and even if you order from there site they pass it off to Doordash. The problem is you don't have anyway to communicate with the driver because you didn't order through Doordash<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I am a regular customer at pizza guys. I been observing this place for a while they have great prices and new deals. The store is following all covid-19 guide lines, all the workers wear mask and gloves. The store manager is really nice and always has a positive vibe around the store greets everyone nicely. I would recommend this place to everyone who’s Around Petaluma or in Petaluma.< /Text>< pictures>

At our office in Petaluma, many of us are on the road in the solar, storage, and electrical business.
But when we manage to be in at our desks at the same time, once or twice a week,  we become honorary "pizza guys"-the ones who are going to eat and enjoy it-and call our local Pizza Guys in Petaluma.
Responsive, customer service oriented--a consistently tasty pizza is ready right when promised.
I think it says something that the pizza-crust, sauces, and toppings- are consistently tasty, after a couple+ years.
We've tried others, but these "pizza guys"  like The Pizza Guys in Petaluma!<//Text>

Tonight I ordered pizza from pizza guys and I  live in cotati I told the guy on the phone 3 times how I would like my order and to please make sure it will be correct well my lady went to pick it up and got all the way back home with the pizza to find that it was all wrong we specifically told them light red sauce extra cheese and a few other toppings and we get both the pizza barely any cheese on them and they were soaking in heavy red sauce so I called to speak to a manager they were supposed to remake the order and deliver it and they call me back 5 minutes later to tell me no we are not going to remake your order and we will refund your money when we didn't want a refund we wanted the pizza and they have very bad customer service and was rude about it I hope the owner sees this and does something about it as this was not my fault cause the manager was trying to make it my fault i said its not my fault that your employees can't read simple directions on making pizza I told him I will be leaving a yelp review and his response was he would try to have it removed.  We go there alot and have spent alot of money there in the past to be treated this way is very shameful.  If I could give it no stars I would but u have to put 1 very displeased tonight smh<//Review>

This place used to be good. Too many mistakes are made now and the quality is inconsistent. I ordered 2 pizzas from them this week and they were barely edible. One of them I ordered thin crust and they gave the regular crust instead. Another one they made the wrong size so they threw in an extra small one. It was undercooked and soft and too much cheese. They also forgot to put jalapeños on one pizza. They are nice people, but need more training on how to make pizza.</text>

Ordered a pizza at 7:53. Called back at 8:49 and was told they didnt have any drivers. I could pick it up or have door dash bring it. I told him door dash would be great! Order still not showing up so I call at 9:44 to ask when it will be here. Guy on the phone says he shows no order. I have been ordering from these guys for two years. Service has been ok, not great, until now unless you really like your pizza after it has been mishandled and looking more like a calzone with it shoved into the side of the box. It's now 10 pm and I need to find some dinner. Never again!< /Text>

My husband and I ordered a large pizza with beef and black olives and we specifically stated that we are kosher and also both allergic to green peppers.... They gave us a pepperoni and green pepper pizza and when they brought us a new pizza which was correct, the pizza was undercooked and our desert cookie was too salty somehow<//review>

I don't think I would have tried this place based upon its name, but it is solid pizza. How can I describe it? I can say the names of pizza brands I think it beats. I think you should just try it, and see if you like it as well.
I just came back here to review it again. I love this place. I get a custom pizza with thin crust (canadian bacon, black olives, jalapenos, and extra mozzarella). Their salads are also very solid. I'm trying the spinach one tonight, and it's like a BLT. So good. I had to call and change my order from takeout to delivery tonight, and they didn't even flinch.</text>

Been ordering for awhile now.  Have not had anything from here that I did not like. Staff is very courteous and friendly also.  Came in during work and they gladly refilled my thermo flasks with cold tap water on a very hot day (I work outdoors all day).  This is my new favorite pizza place.<//text>

<text>I ordered the Tuscan Chicken pizza on two different occasions.  The menu claims fresh cut Roma tomatoes as one of the toppings.  Not one single piece of tomato, either time.  Could not taste or smell any parmesan either, and I'm unusually good at making out ingredients just by tasting or smelling a meal.  They never mentioned to me that they were out of tomatoes, they just didn't put them on the pizza.  The menu also claims "Creamy White Garlic Sauce" as a topping.  No such thing on my pizza this time around, and the time before they did add sauce, but very little. Because of this, the pizza is rather dry and not very flavorful.<//text><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085b46352893959:0x8964a3627189aa23<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you like terrible service and damaged shoes come here! Bought a pair of shoes on clearance and came home to find half of the back of the shoe ripped! They didn’t even mention that It was damaged before they sold it. The service there was also terrible, they had two employees who didn’t do anything to help us the entirety of our stay. It’s no wonder why half of their store is on clearance!< /text>

They have very good service and all but I don’t think they checked the shoes when they packed it because we came home with 1 pair of shoes that had 2 left ones in it.< /review>

Friendly staff but the prices aren't good. Most of the shoes they sale there at a "discounted price" are cheaper elsewhere. I found Asics shoes there for $90, the exact same ones at Kohls for $40 and then Walmart for $25! Same for my daughters shoes, Vans for $48 there and $35 at Kohls. My sister found Converse there for $50 and on the Converse website, the same ones for $30. Check before buying, it's not always cheaper.< /review>

Came in at 2pm for lunch and walked out. Young man behind counter touching his face and wearing his mask below his nose. No clean gloves. This Subway looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. Ceiling tiles and vents were filthy. I love Subway but just got sick to my stomach when I saw his behavior and the condition of the store. Need to educate your staff and clean this store.< /review>

Also the place looks dirty.
Really an unpleasant experience.

<text>Quick service and usually fresh every time we have come to this location.  Sometimes they don't have certain items we are looking for because they have run out but we do come late so I'm sure that's normal. My wife likes the wraps and I usually get the Italian subs.<//text>< Pics>

I had the best experience here yesterday, there was 3 awesome ladies. The one that helped me with my order  looked like a very happy person, definitely a conversation starter, Besides that, the restaurant was clean, my sandwich was great.#subway #Greatcustomerservice< /review>

<Review>I'd really like to give this place negative 20. As a former employee, I'd like to let everyone know just how they treat their employees. From day one I noticed how unprofessional they were by how they'd talk to us all. They claimed we were a TEAM but a TEAM does not act this way. A TEAM is meant to help, uplift and support at all times one another. Not when they choose. New management swore things would run smoother but refuses to help anyone out while she is there. She likes to hide in the back and then talk down on us when things aren't done. I didn't plan on this post, but the last straw was when they wanted to play games with my last check. So as of now, I'm letting the public know that this place has no respect for their employees and doesn't have any problems talking down on us to customers. I am moving forward and taking all steps to inform whoever is needed so hopefully they change and everyone is treated as deserved, with RESPECT. If any former co-workers see this, you deserve way more! Best of luck!!< /Review>< Time>

<response>None</response><Review>The one on Palmdale  rd and Amargosa rd in Victorville was horrible. I couldn't believe both our sandwiches had something in it. My daughters Spicy Italian had hairs in it. But what takes the cake is my husband bit into a small piece of metal in his meatball sandwich. Blew our minds. Never in a million years has anything like that happened.  They made good on it and gave our money back but will never go back. First clue when my daughter said look at the Guacamole. It was almost black.  I drove 7 miles back to show them. The 1 girl apologized and she said she knew where the metal chard came from. Lucky it wasn't a child.<//Review>< gmapID>

This particular store employees not so nice employee behind the counter fixing sandwiches kept touching his hat with his hands. The food didn't look very appetizing it should have been changed out got food poisoning but I should have left when I saw him keep touching his hat when you work around food you cannot touch food can't be scratching your face this is why you have gloves on. He needs to go back to training or they need to train their employees better on health and safety in the kitchen. Because I like someone and I like to eat fresh but I sure don't like to get sick when I eat fresh.< /Review>

They need to have organic vegetables, and grass fed,& finished meats without hormones & antibiotics, cage free pastured raised chicken. Healthier foods for us who want to be healthy.<//review>

Staff is super friendly and the young lady that helped me made my sandwich perfect! Did I mention that it was free? I only had to pay the 2 bucks and change for the soda. I also received a free cookie for taking a survey. I live a good deal, especially when I'm broke!<//Text>

There was a line of 2 orders prior to mine and one after me, yet they only had one person working the front. I placed my order, and they didn't even have the ONE thing I wanted. "It's not ready." Being pregnant, this is the ONLY thing that I wanted, so I walked out. This was my first AND last visit to this location. Terrible, just terrible!!!!!!< /review>

Great service & very clean, the gentleman who open this morning was very friendly when I ordered my breakfast he also said what type of coffee do you want. Originally I was just going to buy the sandwich but because how friendly he was and the way he presented the coffee assuming that I wanted the breakfast deal I bought it...That's how you stay in business great job & I wish I would have gotten his name!<//review>

Owner or the manager need to get a meeting together because this place is going DOWN HILL rude and stingy with the portions which I do understand they might be told to do that but if I say I can pay for extra then put extra and the worst part employees will wear gloves but touch everything! Money cash register etc... and then come make the rest of your sandwich
Want some lettuce 🤗< /review>

1st lady was real nice but the skinny girl with all the make up had a attitude with me while she was asking what vegtables i wanted. Real rude an made me not want to finish business but i still ordered cause i was already there. Made me feel uncomfortable and i did nothing but pick out the vegtables i wanted< /review>

When my car has been parked under a pine tree, with a "murder" of crows in the branches, I need more than a drive thru car wash. I can scrub and spray to my heart's content at the Fair Oaks Coin-Op car wash. With some fiddling, I use my debit card and then add minutes. It's pretty fun. Your shoes won't get THAT wet, but choose carefully.</Review>

Who do I contact about a problem? I used a credit card on Sunday, 10/4/20 at approx 11:45am in the wash bay on the far left side or north end. It was supposed to give me at least 7 minutes of wash time, and I only got about 2 minutes. :(     I did not find a contact phone number or info to notify someone.  **I gave it 2-stars because when I inserted cash to continue washing my car, the system worked properly. I will change my 2-star review if I am contacted and this problem is handled.**< /Text>

Good selection of beers and cider. Generous portions of excellent food. Homey pub atmosphere. I'm not a big sports fan, though, so would have rathered other (or better yet - no) TV choices. The staff are friendly and efficient. A good place for a pint and a pause in your day.< /review>

<Text>The new owners have really fixed it up.  It looks like a total dump on the outside but inside its great and the food is wonderful.  Reminds me of some of the much more expensive bars in Pasadena.  I would say the food is gourmet quality.  Great after work hangout for a beer and food.</Text><UserId.>105226244792855580654< /UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Ordered all you can eat tacos, but only received 3 tiny tacos before they ran out. When my friends and I brought this up to the owner, he responded by saying there was nothing he could do and when we got mad he had us thrown out of the bar and threatened to call the cops.</Review>

Working class neighborhood dive bar. Great food and great beer. Alot of these bad reviews seem to come from hipster types that are use to going to places like Applebees or Chili's for their brews. This is Azusa/Irwindale! Don't expect any sugar-coated drama here.< /text>

If you're looking for a decent place to buy a drink, to get some food, or just socialize with friends, DONT GO HERE!!! The food portions were incredibly small, the word from multiple employees here is incredibly unaccountable, and the environment is very disrespectful. From someone who is pretty low-key and relaxed at bars, I had a terrible experience here, along with several other people at the random night I went:

- No kidding, the bar tenders were looking to pick fights with some people asking questions about the promotion.
- It was taco night and they ran out of tacos (which was the sole reason I came)
- The owner said the f-word to several customers and wore a shirt that said "F*** B*****s and get drunk. Be like me". Which was a pretty good reflection of the kind of culture this bar had.
- Multiple employees were smoking at the entrance to the bar, which was unpleasant to people that don't smoke cigarettes
- It wasn't easy to park here and it I did not feel safe while I was in the parking lot (which this is the fist bar I can ever say that about).

If you are looking for some good bars here are some around the area I would suggest!
- The Congregation
- Rude Dogs (no ones actually rude here).</review>

Irish- well, there was I'm pretty sure something somewhere on the wall that alluded to green Irish some-thing and I'm sure the tenants had some sort of possible bloodlines, uhh I don't what else made it Irish. Lol.

It actually was tbh the basic run of the mill "Irish" pub, generally quite charmingly quaint & kinda old school- small-towney like, really the everyone's "has it for a hit up & run thru & hop on from" typical teensy weensy of a bar that's been around for enough relative nostalgia/ stereo-typical flare to make it classic~ & still at least a try once Or twicefor fun gang hang< /Review></record>

We had 8 people meet there only a couple people there and still had horrible service. Drink was water and a lot of the beer was flat or they didn't have.  Not even good enough to call a dive bar. Really disappointed from what it used to be.</Text>

<Review>PS enrolled me in auto renew for $60 a year without telling me. I found the charge on my card randomly. Literally zero emails, calls, not even a notification in my play station profile. Now I’ve been on hold for 30 minutes, not even an estimated wait time or any assurance that someone will take my call. Just straight to hold music. This feels a lot like a scam. Also: stealing. If this doesn’t get resolved in the next handful of minutes, I’m literally abandoning PS and Sony. Selling my play station. Why patronize a company that clearly doesn’t gaf about their customers or like...being ethical.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9<//Gmap_id></record>

Was on hold for 15mn or so, was reading the terrible reviews and was pretty nervous to be honest. I had a card issue on my account that I wasn’t able to remove or update, was helped immediately on their end and fixed. Super happy with the outcome, thank you again!< /review>

Thought my issues were resolved and they aren't. I just want my card to be taken off my account that I'm not even able to access and to cancel the whole account. Chat support sucks. First person had me fooled. Probably won't even get a refund. Second person never replied back after about 5 minutes. Good job guys 👏< /Text>

Immediately called PlayStation and emailed them back. No answer to either. In the meantime my back account was fraudulently charged $150 dollars before I could shut my card off. Tried to call again sent another email no response from PlayStation. Seems like this is a common problem with PlayStation. Maybe it’s time for a class action lawsuit. At a minimum the next console I buy will not be a PlayStation. Since they clearly don’t give a s**t about their customers.

Update. Got a hold of PlayStation. They basically told me if I report fraud which is what this is they will ban my account. I will be throwing away all 3 of my PlayStations and switching to a console that has better service. PlayStation is trash. I’m very disappointed cause I’ve spent thousands on PlayStation equipment and content. I’ve played it since the original PS as a kid. Whoever is running the show over there needs to be fired.</Text><user_name>Sean Killgore<//user_name><Gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>My grandson just got off is ps4 an hour ago and now he is trying to get back on and this is what it says. ( Access to Playstation Network by this account has been permanently suspended due to violations of Playstation Network terms of service and user agreement (ws-37368-7). What up with that he was playing fortnite with his friends.  He did nothing wrong or said nothing wrong!!!!!!!!!! We all should get together and sue them. I've spent a lot on money on Playstations and their stuff.. I bought 3 ps4 for my grandkids. I've bought games online and accessories for the games.

<Text>First of all, my account was locked for almost a  day and I tried to reset my password but they wouldn’t send me an email verification, so due to this I tried to call psn support and guess what, NO ONE ANSWERED, and so the next day I tried calling them again, they answered but I was put on hold, then I got a call from a random number and so I answered, the lady on call described herself as a CSR but she sounded sketchy. She asked for my credentials in order to verify my account and from there I knew it was a scam. Tried calling them again but they didn’t answer. Now my account is currently out of my hands and I can’t do nothing about it. Spent money on you guys to be treated like this? Hell nah I’m switching to Xbox, matter of fact, PC.<//Text>< pics>

Account banned for a chargeback because NO ONE answers the phone and chat is “too busy” due to Covid.  How can you get your money back if they don’t answer the phone or answer chat?  Call your bank and request a chargeback. Wait a minute...as soon as you do that, your account gets banned!   So someone is actually working after all??  Just not in the custoemrs interests.  This makes the nex-gen console decision very easy for me.

This kind of business model went out with the dinosaurs.  So did outsourcing your support to India..one of the rudest cultures around.  Sure, Sony saves a buck using $1 support people, but wow, no support for a multi-billion dollar company? Bad choice.  I’m out..moving on.<//review>

<text>I spent $50 on a game that requires PlayStation plus so I try to buy PlayStation plus but a error keeps popping up. I google a way to fix it but nobody knows how so now I have to get in touch with PlayStation in order to pay more for a game I already bought. And the worse part is PlayStation won’t even answer their phone and they see the issue with PlayStation plus but they still request money and still won’t fix it. Do better if u want somebody to buy a $500 console from u.<//text>< userid>

THEY DESERVE 0 my son's account was hacked and they told him he had to wait 6 months nothing happened. It's been almost a year. Now they shut down the account for miss use. Thousands of dollars in games lost. No one will do nothing about it. Now when he try to text them they just they ask his account number and they do not respond after that this is bull.
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.
IF YOU SELL DOWNLOADABLE STUFF YOU NEED PPL TO ANSWER CALLS AND HELP THEM GET THE ACCOUNT BACK HE SHOULD NEVER OF LOST HIS PRIME ACCOUNT.<//Text>

So I was banned for 7 days and I called to appeal it and I called and called and they never answered. So I just waited until my ban was done. I did and I played for about 15 minutes and boom, banned again for no reason and this time it’s for 30 days. I called and emailed PlayStation sooo many times and they yet to respond back to me. PlayStation to be honest if your going to have a company, be good at customer service. This makes me want to switch back to Xbox if this keeps happening.</text>

This is literally the worst customer service I have ever experienced, do not buy PlayStation products. If something goes wrong you’re out of luck because you can’t call customer supports (“we can’t take your call at this time”) and their online chat bot can’t actually do anything helpful. Just an animated QA bot. If I could rate it lower then one star I would. I asked for a call back then an hour later they call back, automated message tells me “we are connecting you with a person” then the call ends.... DONT BUY PLAYSTATION PRODUCTS.< /review>

<Review>I am in complete shock!!! I have called this number 50 times and every time the automated system says "due to extremely high call volumes we are unable to take your call at this time, goodbye"  I have spent $1000's of dollars on Sony products over many years!!! I will NEVER EVER give this company another penny! There customer service doesn't exist !! Don't waste your money or time! Sony is a JOKE!< /Review>< Time>

I enjoy playstation but the thing is that me and my brother where hacked and they have not helped at all we have called and tried the support bot but nothing is helping and the guy who did this even changed our gmail from the psn account so now all of our saved progress is gone all of our games but the fact is this guy didnt even hack us he just called support and said he didnt remember anything but the username and they gave him everything that was ours so we had to switch to xbox and create a whole new gmail to play and the fact my mom has to work during covid but these people cant run computers because of this pandemic is not right< /review>

<review>HORRIBLE customer service. This place needs to get a grip. Hire more associates that can answer calls! My sister has a problem with signing into her PSN account. We have called ten times on 10 different days and we receive the same message. “Due to high call volume we are unable to take your call”. Are they taking anyone’s? Love to hear from customer service. But I doubt that will ever happen in my lifetime :)<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>Absolute trash. My account was hacked and charges were made around $300 worth. It has been a struggle to get ahold of Sony. I finally did and they eventually reimbursed me the money but my account is still locked. Was told I’d receive an email within 7 business days on how to access my account and reset password after their investigation. It’s been over a month now. Whoever hacked my account changed my username and password..<//text>< Rating>

<text>Playstation customer support offers the worse customer service ever, they make all this money, yet provide the worse service.  It's a scam. There always extremely busy, no options for a call back number. Call waiting is extensive and they just tell you to go online to resolve your issues and hang up on you. Even the online services through the chat bot are ridiculous and inconvenient.  What a shame.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

“Please note that technical support is unable to help you...”

I’d also like to add that it is impossible to directly call their customer service.</Review>

<text>Called many times and all I get is "call volume is to high good bye". Is this how playstation treats people now? I remember they use to care and answer peoples calls. They need to get there stuff together and hire people to answer there phones. Online support sucks worse then the calls itself. All you suckers bought playstation 4 and 5 to support them haha.< /text>< name>

Account got hacked. They changed password, email, and username. Help line says they need one of those to do anything with account. Wont accept old account info, won’t accept PS4 serial number to deactivate it, won’t accept fraudulent purchase info. Keeps claiming “we can’t do anything at this moment” refuses to answer WHEN they’re able to do something. Screw Sony, screw ps4. I’m switching to Xbox. Great job you unhelpful, literal human excrement of a company.<//Review>

Also whats with you guys not picking the phone up ever its total bs.</text>

The absolute worst customer service. My sons account was hacked and he was locked out due to the hacking. He called 8 times, waited on hold
For hours and when he finally got a representative they were rude and unhelpful. How hard is it to unlocked a locked account due to fraud. My son was the victim and Sony PlayStation is of no help. I even called and was left on hold for an hour. What an embarrassment they should be ashamed of themselves.< /review>

I feel everyone else's frustration with Playstation, and how they don't really care about their consumer's. They permanently suspended my account because I fought what I thought was a fraudulent charge because it said other things besides Playstation network, so I disputed it. To which instead of doing the reasonable thing and contact me to see what happened to their payment they acted like little children and suspended my account. I've contacted them for 4 days either by email or by trying to get a live person on the phone to no avail. What I did do was file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and let them run with it. Supposedly now that I paid them they'd better reactivate my account.</Text>

Id give zero stars if I could. No live phone customer service and they disconnect from chat service if you can figure out how to actually contact someone. When they disconnect they then block you becuase "they've already helped you"  well ps4 customer service. You didnt help me. Someone hacked my account. They stole from my real bank account and change the phone number on my account so I can't get my account back. I've loved PlayStation products since ps1 and after this ill never buy another one. This is ridiculous.< /Text>

Another poor review to the worlds worst customer service.  Playstation and Sony are awful!  It’s virtually impossible to get ahold of anyone via phone.  And their “chat” is a chat bot, who is unable to help with anything.  Do yourself a favor and charge back your playstation console with your bank, and buy an xbox. Sony holds no loyalty to people who live here in the USA.<//Review>

If I could give it a -5 stars I would. We were banned bc I disputed charges on PSN thru my card company in MARCH when covid hit. We had just purchased a playstation so we would have something to do during quarantine. We haven't been able to play it since the ban and cannot get a hold of customer service or use the chat bot. Completely ridiculous. I have come to loathe this company. It is the WORST customer service!< /Review>

My account was locked and banned due to someone hacking into it, I called my bank to get myself a new card and the money that was spent back into my account. They banned me for doing so and I. Order to get my account back I had to pay that money back and now I’m going through hell to get access to all of my saved games all the time and money spent o. Created players and all I deserve it back but nobody seems to care about their paying customers I’m about ready to switch to Xbox I don’t hear them complaining not one bit.....WHOSE WITH ME<//text>

Just the same as other people my account was hacked and someone bought two games that I would never play. They refused to refund the money for those games, even though i didn’t even purchase those games. There was no phone operators and I got disconnected from the chat I was in because it took to long to type. I feel for all the other people who have experienced this problem, as my account got banned, but they lifted it, then it got banned again for the same reason at the beginning of this virus.</Text>

Account suspended for 7 days with no warning or anything. Now, you can’t get ahold of anyone to answer why.  PlayStation, you are a joke. I’d be ashamed to be so soft. Hope you go bankrupt.<//text>

<Review>My account has been hacked and this company does not care about me as a customer what so ever. All the money and time I've spent on my account means nothing to this corporate monster. I've been trying for a while now to recover my account while someone else has been on it playing my games. It seems this company has nothing set in place to help protect customer accounts during this pandemic. There is not a single real person i can get in contact with. I go onto their website only to be met with a wall of bots and scripts designed for specific operations that have nothing to do with the issue i have. It says on their support website that they will not have phone operators for another 2-3 weeks. This means the hacker will have my account and bank information for that long as well. I wonder how much damage he will do in that time.</Review>< Pictures>

I’m starting to think y’all don’t care about your customers at all especially when y’all mess up.
That live chat is no help !! And I can’t talk to anyone on the phone to resolve my issue</Review>

The phone number you call will tell you it’s currently unavailable and to use the live chat on PlayStation support. You will lose connection to the live chat before it ever connects with someone if you even try. The website is terribly put together and makes it impossible to actually fix your problem.<//text><user>102644307435277498053<//user><name>Jack Robertson<//name>< pics>

<text>Just absolutely pathetic customer service and support. They will literally do nothing when you have an issue. I have issues with my playstation everyday trying to run games, can't get a hold of PlayStation to resolve things. I'm furious and fed up. I spent a lot of money on my games and even got a game drive so the games would run off the game drive instead of the system and it helped but playstation will clearly never resolve theirs fu***** problems. Better to just switch to pc or xbox.< /text>< UserId.>

Online support is a joke. I'm trying to change my email and they won't update because I need to remember the serial number to the first console I owned that I set my account on, a ps3 14 years ago.... And the last 4 of a Cc I no longer own. And to top it off their phone service is closed.

Good job Sony.....< /review>

I went homeless as a veteran for a while. Couldn’t log into old email account because yahoo doesn’t have customer service. Had to set up new account, but when I tried to talk to chat to see if I had to repurchase FFXIV even though it was on my Square Enix account, I was rudely disconnected promptly. Did not hit refresh or anything on my side so it was them. Why have a customer service that has individuals getting paid, which our PlayStation Plus membership is more than likely funding if this is what happens? Maybe they should lower the psn monthly cost if we don’t get the proper service we deserve. Very disappointed in them. I know we are just a number, but to me, this is an escape to help my ptsd after 47 months in Iraq and Afghanistan. Shame on you Sony</text>

<review>You guys are horrible. You’ve been taking money out of my account for MONTHS!  But I can’t get ahold of anyone on the phone.  You want us to request a refund via the Support Bot but that entire process is dumb.  I answered a series of seven (7) questions just to get redirected to a number that IS NOT IN USE!

I would like my money back.< /review>< pics>

<review>My husband's account was hacked so he disputed the charges and was given back the money through his bank! Months later playstation decides to suspend his account because there is an overcharge on fortnite. My husband live chats with them and their only response is that to unsuspend his account he has to pay the $64 that HE DIDNT CHARGE! That's extremely piss poor customer service ESPECIALLY when he can prove he didn't do it! Will NEVER buy another playstation product again!< /review><Rating>1</Rating>< userid>

My account has been hacked by someone in Saudi Arabia and I can’t seem to recover it. I try calling customer support but they’re somehow always busy. They need to have people work from home or something because I have hundreds of dollars in this account and I need to fix this.< /Text>

Worst experience I ever had. There is literally no way to contact them. Sony no longer offers phone support and the request a chat won't get past the pre chat verification, which I've tried 8 times.  Since I have wasted hours of time reading and watching tutorials that don't answer my question and they prevent me from contacting them I give them Negative 5 Stars, that's (-5). NOTE: you can't post your comment without giving them at least 1 star, but don't let that prerequsite fool you. I also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.<//Text>

<review>Absolutely a joke with them lately, I use to share the same account with my brother however it’s mine now so I decided to change the email however the verification code was sent to his number and he doesn’t have a line anymore and there is no way of getting the verification code to sign back into psn I’m about to switch to Xbox I understand this whole corona thing but they need to be working at home because clearly they are not and all these reviews show. Just sad how much money spent and they have to take forever. Is it really playstation support? Because it doesn’t seem like it.<//review>< Time>

Absolutely terrible and frustrating that I can’t get a hold of them! My account was hacked somehow and they ended up suspending my account! Which is absolutely not fair because I didn’t do this. I’ve been trying to get a hold of them for a month and no response yet. If social media reps are still working I wouldn’t see why Sony still isn’t. And to know that I’m not the only one who is experiencing a suspended account speaks volume!!!<//Review>

With all stores closed I bought my son his birthday present through PlayStation. I removed my card from the game system. And still over 700 dollars was stolen off my card. My whole stimulus check was stolen from PlayStation and they r refusing to stop charging my child for games he doesn't own.<//text>

My credit card is continuously  being  billed and I don't  have a play station or any video games. I can't get anyone  on the line who can help  me.  I am about to open a suit against  them to get my money back.  I don't have an account but they keep taking money.< /Review>

<review>So, my PlayStation account has been locked because I went to change my gamertag and I forgot that I had gotten a new phone number and forgot to change it in my profile on Playstation so the two step verification tried to send me a code and I could not receive that code, I tried to use one of the backup codes but whenever I changed my gamertag, it log me out of all of my account so I had no way to get into my account. They won't answer the phone and their support website has no answers. I literally have three Platinum trophies, I'm level 650 on GTA V, I have Damascus on Modern Warfare. I just have a lot of time put into that account and I just lost everything. I just wish they would help...< /review></record>

I've been trying to contact Playstation regarding my account. My account has been deactivated because I stop payment on an unauthorized charge. So now I can log into y account. I've went on the website it says that I have to chat with some or call but the chat is down when you call the phone number the messages says to talk with someone via chat. This has been going on for 3 weeks now. This is worst ever. All I want to do is play my play station.< /text>

Terrible customer support!! Call services are down. Unable to connect to support via live chat. Their twitter account doesnt resolve anything. I used to be such a PlayStation fan now I would never support them again. DO NOT BUY PS5 WHEN IS COMES OUT! I switched to PC gaming and its sooo much better. No more over paying for PS Plus services!< /text>

<review>It deserves 0 stars this company is trash when it comes to customer service. There is no way I get suspended for nothing. I don't even know why I was suspended. I just wake up one day to see that my account has been suspended. Trash. Horrible services. Even after I try to contact them they have bots responding to me.</review>< Pictures>

Ive been trying to reach these people for months and they are always “close”. There’s no phone services for customer at all! They referred you to go PlayStation support but  there’s no even an online rep that can answer your questions or concerns. I don’t understand!!!< /Text>

When someone’s network is hacked your company provides no support whatsoever. You only respond to the bank when the charges are disputed. If anyone is reading this please don’t make purchases on the PSN they have very poor cyber security and don’t provide help at all.< /Text>< pics>

PlayStation continues to charge my credit card for charges I didn’t authorize. I have called customer support unable to get anyone on the phone they advise to go to their website. I go on the website they won’t connect you to a live chat with an agent only a bot. And when I answer all the questions it says you are reaching the agency outside of normal business hours however, I am not. I am getting very frustrated bc every month being charged 9.99$ for something I don’t use and I can’t cancel or get a refund.</text>

<Time>1587575128021< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>My PSN account was hacked on Sunday 4/19. My Email and password were changed and fraudulent charges were made on my account. Now I am unable to sign back in to the PSN. I have contacted the PlayStation support live chat at least 40 times now. I have all the information they need. But they tell me they “don’t have access to the account because of security reasons” then who does have access!?!? No one seems to have any answers over there. Someone STOLE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MY MONEY. THAT IS A CRIME! Who is going to reimburse me for the hundreds of dollars I’ve lost in games. And have no common decency to respond. I know others have had this same problem and no one is helping them either.< /Review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>If I could give negative stars I would. My husband’s account got hacked and charged my credit card $100+. After several days of trying to use the Bot, I created a Twitter account to get ahold of them. The twitter account told me to talk to the live chat, which I couldn’t get through. Then Twitter account ignored MANY messages and tweets. I had to contact my bank and then PlayStation banned my husbands account. Extremely disappointed that they have the worst customer service I have every dealt with. Hopefully their company will make things right when COVID is over, as I have seen many situations where this is happening and PlayStation is just stealing money from people. During a time where people do not have jobs, PlayStation is just money hungry.< /text><gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9</gmap_id>< username>

I’ve been a PlayStation freak ever since I was in high school(I’m in my mid 30s). I bought a PS4 Pro a year ago. I’ve been trying to contact PlayStation for almost 2 weeks. As of 2-3 days ago it went past the 1year marker. So now it’s out of warranty. The PlayStation Pro was a total failure! How does the hard drive die within a year?! PlayStation you are failing us miserably!<//text>

I was double charged for PlayStation plus, and cant get ahold of anyone to get one of the charges reversed!!! My monthly subscription wasnt extended by two months but I was charged for two months!   Also, I NEVER put my credit card out there online, I use a pre-paid card, and I NEVER turn on auto pay. It is always turned off after every renewal. Yet Sony automatically debited my card!!  Whatever kind of business they are running here, we want no part of it!!!   This is why we are considering going to Xbox.< /text>

I got banned for a “inappropriate user Id” when my name is “Wndow_lickr”. And all my games are locked except for the ones I have on disk and the games I pre ordered come out tomorrow and I doubt I’ll be able to play them upon launch now. The phone services are down. I can’t get through live chat because they changed my online Id and won’t let me view my new one because you have to log in to view it. But I can’t log in because my account is banned... worst costumer service ever. I love PlayStation when it works, but it messes up it shouldn’t take weeks to fix.</review>

I have tried to call for 3 weeks and was constantly sent to the answering service that told me to call back. Then I tried to reach out to the chat and they told me that for my issues I needed to talk to a live agent. They never gave me a time for an appointment. Today I finally get  to talk to a live person and it was completely pointless. The conclusion of the call was that I have to pay PlayStation money for the money they stole out my account. This is not the first occurrence. They told me it is my fault for having a card on file even though I turned off auto payments multiple times and canceled it from my PlayStation and was still charged again. Also the supervisor was very dismissive and told me to just make a new account even though it is my business account. I have had every PlayStation device and I will never buy from this again. Horrible customer service and no regard for their customers.</Review>

It appears that there are not any remote policies, systems, nor procedures in place to assist, guide and support customers during this current pandemic. Since last week I have been trying to reach someone besides the inefficient refund bot to discuss two charges to my accoung that I did not make. No one is available and I am still awaiting a refund.< /review>

I’ve scrubbed and deactivated every device until the only thing left was the PlayStation. I contacted my isp and had my router given a new I’d. My up is dynamic and they still blamed everyone else. Then when I tried to get help during when most people are available they are closed on every single way of communication. No twitter response, phone center is closed, and the chat was down. I work for a major corporation that puts our customers first. That is not what PlayStation is doing</Text>< Pictures>

because of my mistake one day that I could not enter play online I tried all the ways to enter but I could not .. By mistake 2 more payments were added ..knowing that I had already paid my annual fee. I tried to talk to The playstation costumer service to explain what had happened but until the date I could not Conctact anyone, the problem is that I call my bank And they fought the charge that was Charged. Now They came to the conclusion that I actually did the purchase , I accept it well any ways 2 more years play online is ok. But now I. Have neither the service. Nor even 180$$ they took. From my account😡</text>< Pics>

they really don't care at all that my account was stolen from me. I have been trying to recover my account for a week now and they refuse to help me. I have spent years on this account and have thousands of dollars and time put into that account and they're just gonna let someone else steal it. I am close to calling my lawyer and putting a lawsuit because of this.</review>

Play station consul was “not bad” after I bought their year plus membership, a week later I see an unauthorized charge for another membership from Sony, so I ended up calling my banks fraud department, couple Days later Sony send an email my account has been suspended for chargebacks. no customer service whatsoever just bots smh, I’d give them 0 stars if that would be possible. Time to flip the switch to Xbox!< /text>

They’ve been lying for weeks saying their support line is just limited. It’s just a voicemail that has a bot be more honest than the company and admit the line is closed. I’ve been trying to get in touch with support because I’ve tried to sign up with PS Now but it says there’s a ghost PayPal signed in on pc, then on the PS4 it says there’s no payment information but refuses to allow my dad to sign in his PayPal. Not changing my review until this is resolved.<//Text>

<review>PSN refuses to answer the phone I’ve called multiple times everyday at different times each day for the past week yet no answer it’s honestly amazing how terrible the customer service is

Update: I called at the exact time the call center opened and finally they answered but apparently they have a call center just so they can tell you they don’t have the ability to help and you have to do everything online which I had already done and it didn’t work so I’m yet to have my problem solved</review><time>1612265780251<//time><user>100243498648968186448< /user>< response>

<text>My son was logged out of his account when we tried to log back in  “incorrect password”. After changing the password now they want 2 part factor code which we are not logged in on any other device so not possible to receive one. I tried to call customer service not available at the moment. online support not available at the moment. So imagine a nine-year-old boy dealing with the covid-19 lockdown and not having access to his account. THANK YOU SONY!!! I was going to buy him the PS5 for Christmas. Now he doesn’t want it anymore.  Xbox here we come!!!!< /text>< user>

It wouldn’t let me refund a game that I had just purchased last night just because I downloaded it. I wanted to refund the game because I was to young to play it with my friends but I can play it by myself though and I can’t even change my age so I have to wait til I’m 18 in order to play the game so this was a waste of time DONT BUY A PS4 UNLESS YOUR ACCOUNT IS OVER 18 and if it isn’t then your screwed on most things might as well just BUY AN XBOX<//review>

I was charge 24.99 for 3 months worth of internet that was not authorized by me. Couldn't get a whole of them. So i call my bank to dispute the charge. Next thing i know psn sent me a email saying my account is suspended. Never did i had any problems with playstation until this matter. I rather go back to the ps3. At least i wasn't disappointed. But will say this who ever is willing to put a lawsuit on playstation. Im game cause i put to much money in this system.<//Review>

There is no support whatsoever. No one to speak with on the phone, no one to IM over the internet, nothing. This is super frustrating and I will take this into consideration when I purchase my next system. Super disappointing misleading.< /Text>

<review>They allow people to make racist slurs and get away with it it is unforgivable and customer service is horrible it is not worth the initial 350 dollars for the system plus the 60 dollars a year to actually play games. If you say anything to anyone they will suspend your account if if you are not in the wrong they are very unprofessional and a waste of time.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I've called several times and nobody has picked up, my account is on man for 1 week because I called somebody an "a@#$¢¥¢" because he went out of his way on gtav to ruin a supply shipment for no reason. Yet I call him that and I'm the one who gets banned? Then PlayStation who has sold probably billions of PlayStation devices can't pick up the phone?</Review>

<text>My account has been hacked. The hacker spent over $500 on PSN. I have been trying to contact customer support for days now. To explain the occurring. I notified my bank and card of the issue. And they were able to reemberse me for the hacker money spent. But now I am banned and can't log into the PSN account and customer support is not open or taking calls. I am very displeased with the service and will be contacting customer support again until answered. Then i will file a civil complaint and take them to court if need be.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I’ve called Sony multiple times over the course of 2 weeks and they haven’t picked up a call with me once and I’m not able to access my account and some how there are still charges of 60-75 dollars a day off of my card this is straight Robbery Sony loves to steal you’re money but when it comes to customer service they prefer of you just never buy a station again< /review>

The worst by far customer support help. You have live chat support agents that put the customers info in a system to help the customers but the customers already typing there info in the chat. Why don't you make that system available to the customers to use instead? The customers already typing those info them selves. Just waste of time & efforts to get to the point that the agent tells you we can't help you please restart a new chat & when you do you get denied from getting to the chat again</Review>

<time>1587089232996<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>My PSN account was stolen and Sony has left me with no means to recover it. Support chat is unable to do anything, and the phone lines are shut down due to Covid. An unknown party has full control over my account, including all of its information and permissions. Sony has left me with no other choice but to cancel my debit card and open another PSN account. I've lost hundreds of dollars' worth of digital downloads purchased over the years, and many hundreds of hours of gameplay, the save data to which I no longer have access to. This company has completely failed to help me after many years of patronage.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Billion dollar company. Wont answer any calls, Finally I was able to reach someone from support on chat. Agent ends chat on the final step towards recovering my account, thus leaving me without access to the account I am currently paying for. Additionally, not a single email has gotten through to me, not once in five+ years across multiple account with different email addresses. I have been a playstation fan for most of my life, but the way youve been handling your customers lately is just shameful.<//text>

They get 0 stars but that wasn’t an option. They changed my online id for no reason at all, then made ME PAY TO CHANGE IT. That should be illegal to change my name then make me pay to change it to something else. Cause they not making money so they gotta go and make money another way by Messing with peoples accounts. I should sue y’all.</Text>

I’m unable to play online mode because there is unknown email appearing when requested to login. Since I don’t know this email nor obviously the password, and since it doesn’t allow me to switch email login info I simply can’t play. Been trying to reach PlayStation, but seems it’s impossible.< /text>

<text>Banned my account for disputing an unauthorized charge on my debit card by a different psn. Can’t get into the chat and they shutdown their phone service for, judging by the reviews in here, a few months now.

<text>The only thing they do on the phone is password reset?? I can do that in 2 seconds from my phone! what do I do when the THIRD dualshock 4 controller ( you know the ones that retail for 64.99?) Starts going bad after 2 months (analog stick drift)? I have gone through 4 of these junky excuses of a controller in less than a year. I don't play call of duty or fortnite the most I've used it is on resident evil 2 and dreams I treat all of my video games so well I don't beat up controllers hell I have an original dualshock that I use on my ps2 all the time and those analog sticks are perfect so what's the deal Sony?< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I keep getting a view on my screen that says "connect a USB storage device that contains an update file for reinstallation for version 7.02 or later you can down load the update file for reinstallation from playstation.com" I have tried everything that I could possibly think of and it is still on my screen when I turn it on< /review>

So I got playstation+ only so the games I have can update in rest mode. This HAS NEVER HAPPENED ONCE in the several months ive had it!! ALL my settings are correct, so don't even suggest I "connect to internet" blah blah blah... what a waste of money!! I don't buy games or whatever else you can do with playstation+, I just wanted the downloading benefits. Horribly disappointing. Not even going to for a refund,  I'll just suggest to all to not even bother purchasing it. A whole years membership for nothing< /text>

Absolutely horrible..

People within the game I am playing are being emboldened by the lack of support and are simply Manufacturing situations that allow them to misuse terms of service by claiming that others are doing the same thing..

ADDITION.. FRI JAN29 2021.

I have recently had my account hacked and within the time the individual had account access they purchased around $130 of AAA content with the linked account/card #..

I never received any notification to change any information on behalf of the account due to the initial intrusion and resulting acquisition of my account..

I contacted PS support and notified them of the hack and the purchased content and regained access through simple steps of verification..

Before ending the phone call I asked the representative what I needed to do to get the illegally purchased content off of my account and that the banking card that was used to purchase the content was canceled to prevent further access and missuse and was told "VERY CONFIDENTLY" that it would be taken care of..

It wasn't..

Its now months after the incident and yesterday night my playstation network account and access to my content ENTIRELY was banned at 4:00 AM without any prior notification or attempts of remediation..

The reason for the ban is that my account was struck for having multiple instances of "Chargebacks" resulting from the cancelation of the bank cards during the unauthorized and "COMPLETELY UNOBSTRUCTED" access of my account which has never been shared or exposed to anyone EVER..

This is negligence..

The fact that I can say I was extorted and then disciplined for that extortion by the mechanism entirely responsible for preventing that initial extortion is completely astonishing and has left me with a fraction of the trust and overall continuity in purchased downloadable content and connecting important financial information within my account to automate subscriptions and quickly aquire developed content..

I refuse to fill out forms or begin petitioning through the methods suggested formally as it would admit or imply guilt of prosses and I am still trying to speak to someone to resolve it..

Im posting this just in case it can be corroborated by other people and potentially linked to a trend as it was right around the holidays and the content was suspiciously focused to blockbuster legacy titles expected to sell over the holiday season..

It is likely the access was granted through exploitation of firmware recently introduced bringing PS5 into the overall ecosystem as the individual was granted access without any of the prerequisite user verification and redundancies that prevent such access..

Regrettably..   a lifetime playstation customer of 20+ years..<//text>

Bought a game from the PS Store but didn't get a chance to play it until over a month after purchase because I was in the middle of another game which took 250 hours to complete.  Turns out the game had a game breaking bug which wouldn't allow me to get past a certain point.  Called them and they told me to contact the publisher for a work around.  Did that but the company never responded to my email.  Called Sony back and they still wouldn't give refund.  Told them OK you're not going to give me my $16.32 back then I'm not spending another penny with Sony so I want a refund on my current wallet amount...they wouldn't do that either.

No matter what you do to fix a playstation issue there is no solution unless you wait hours. I cant belive they havent fixed some of the bs that is still around. Your section for help fixing issues does not work and has never worked it is utterly pointless. You dont put any valid helpful or reliable information on you consle and dont care about your customer's. Playstation is a joke.<//Review>

Do not trust this company they are liars and thieves. They will take your money and account. They will not give it back in their "promised" times.  I suggest try another company and trust none of their so called services.<//Text>

I purchased Mega Man Legacy 2 for $27 without realizing they had Mega Man Legacy 1 and 2 bundle for $19. So I bought Mega Legacy bundle as well assuming that they would refund me $27.

Unfortunately they wouldn't issue me a refund, because they've refunded me in the passed and it was a one time thing. Not only did I speak to the agent, but I also escalated it to the supervisor and manager, and they couldn't do anything. Not even issue me $27 online credit. You can't even sell the game.

I have to say PlayStation has the worst customer service, especially with refunds and my time and money was wasted.  They didn't even have an sympathy towards me for being ripped off. I'm thinking of writing a letter to the head. I'm thinking when new generation counsel gets realised, I might switch over to X-box , PC or Nintendo. Right now I'm very appalled with Sony. I heard X-Box has better customer service and refund policy.

BTW: I would be more than to happy to delete this review if I got my refund.

Thank you<//review>

Worst customer service that I have ever recieved.  Moders kicking people offline and they accept it like they did it, worthless company. Won't reinstate my account saying it was done by them, when in reality it was a moder ban my account.<//Text>

<text>My account is most likely hacked and I’m trying to get to the bottom of this issue. Unfortunately it happened on Xmas. They have terrible service and they have no compassion. They say 24/7 support but that’s a lie. I’m going to look into a law suit. They need to be held responsible for their terrible support service.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>I purchased Mega Man Legacy 2 for $27 without realizing they had Mega Man Legacy 1 and 2 bundle for $19. So I bought Mega Legacy bundle as well assuming that they would refund me $27.

Unfortunately they wouldn't issue me a refund, because they've refunded me in the passed and it was a one time thing. Not only did I speak to the agent, but I also escalated it to the supervisor and manager, and they couldn't do anything. Not even issue me $27 online credit. You can't even sell the game.

I have to say PlayStation has the worst customer service, especially with refunds and my time and money was wasted.  They didn't even have an sympathy towards me for being ripped off. I'm thinking of writing a letter to the head. I'm thinking when new generation counsel gets realised, I might switch over to X-box , PC or Nintendo. Right now I'm very appalled with Sony. I heard X-Box has better customer service and refund policy.

BTW: I would be more than to happy to delete this review if I got my refund.

Your company double charged my account for PlayStation + and when I fought the charges you banned my account! I can’t play any of the games I paid for because of this. Your support isn’t available to assist at all!!! I want to get help with this because now it’s like you have stolen things I have paid for from me</Text>

Unless your Playstation has a warranty, don't send it in to get fixed. Did it 2 times and nothing changed. Very unimpressed. I love the games and the system, but their service center is a joke. Every other experience I have had with Sony has been 5 stars.< /Review>

< Review>
got my account hacked and i had all my card info on there. I can't get one person on the phone. This customer service is horrible. How are they such a big company with no 24 hour service, or at least something better.<//Review>

The worst customer service every experienced. Sent my PS4 to be serviced to get it back still not working. I called to see what was the issue they tell me it was sent back due to a bug not to mention the box my PS4 was in was never opened. Then they say it could of been a bug on the outside if the box due to shipping and it caused them to send my system back without service and they can no longer service the system. This is first class customer robbery to get a customer from under warranty. My system was only played for a week and it stopped working and now they say it's nothing they can do. What makes it even crazier my friend had a system he sent off the week before to get his system back not fixed as well but don't worry this will be my last PlayStation purchase Xbox here I come.</text>

Sony is the best in all aspects and all of the people that are talking about how Sony is no good in the customer satisfaction, customer support is a whole bunch of BS. Sony has held me on every thing that I have asked them about. Doing awesomely Sony.<//Text>

I am outraged at the people at PlayStation because they do not stand by their word. We've been dealing with them for over a week and basically they still will not fix their mistake. How can you hold a 13 yr old accountable for their(PlayStation) mistake. I've never dealt with a company that doesn't put the customers needs first. After speaking to supposedly 3 supervisors we were told you have to fix it yourself. I am so upset right now and I'm seriously considering selling my sons PS4 and going back to Xbox 360 or  Xbox 1 because we had a similiar incident happen with them and they rectified the situation asap and also they realized the mistake was made by a child and we weren't punished for it. I wish there was something more I could do to them but unfortunately one against a corporation is nothing, so please be aware when you call their support line because they don't support.< /text>

My playstation is having problems connecting to the home wifi after our power went off then back on. So i called playstation technical support to figure out if there is anything that i couldve done to fix my ps3. Well sadly i didnt get it fixed but was given some insite on how else to possibly fix my problem. I called and was put on the phone with a man name Jairo and he was the nicest support person ive ever talked to. Now the waiting time was kinda sucky but i think it was worth it. We dont see many people now a days that are that kind when it comes to customer frustration. Thank you Jairo for helping me and staying on the phone for 33 minutes lol. Out of 5 stars i give playstation technical support a 1 for waiting time, and a definite 5 star on support operator "Jairo".< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>to put it simply, your customer service is actually horrendous.

it started off surprisingly good, given the negative feedback i've seen EVERYWHERE. i was sent a box to send my PS4 in very quickly. it's been serviced at no cost to me and currently on it's way back.

this is where the problem begins. they failed to attach the tracking number in a stupidly "do not reply" email. it was supposed to have a tracking number because it specifically says "Tracking #: ". but that's just it. there's only a space where it should be. like someone forgot to fill it out.

i contacted them on the phone, and they actually hung up on me. nevermind that, but your reps talk incredibly quiet and muffled it's so hard to understand.

so, through quite a long time of searching i managed to find the live chat link. i made sure it was business hours, and entered all of my info correctly. i simply needed to request my tracking number. yet, it didn't work. the live chat had an error that wouldn't see my PSN ID as an actual id. i know it was spelled correctly because i copied it from the actual website.

after trying for an hour on 2 different devices and getting the same error, along with impossible reps over the phone, i actually made a twitter just to contact someone. they then informed me, "we can't give you your tracking number here. try live chat again." which COMPLETELY ignored me trying to get them to help me with the live chat. nevermind that, but it took TWO HOURS for them to reply with that. i understand there are a lot of people, but to offer zero help is actually ridiculous.

so, why earlier i would have offered a good review because it was good service- i'll have to give only 1 star.

the fact you goons can't even manage to remember to attach a tracking number is sickening. if you don't fix your customer service, soon enough you won't have any customers.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>worst service ever, they don't care what is wrong with your account or PSN, some ppl don't even speak English   i had sooo many issues with PSN had millions of error codes, psn did not worked, library, was sooo slow, i use to play on PlayStation 1 and Sega Genesis , ps2, ps3, and ps4 is worst of them all plus now they charge you $60 for same free services were getting before, why we pay $60 a year don't know, nothing downloading properly, sometimes PSN don't even work, i spent Thousands on games, am switching. PSN customer service don't even care, even if you buy game, thats it you can't return it even if it don't work, am sooooo pissed at PSN OMFG.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

I contacted them today regarding charges on my account in which I spoke with Melissa who was awful. Could not give me information regarding the charges when we have no games purchased on our console but $145.29 in charges which doesn't make sense. We will be selling our console to Gamestop and not purchasing any products ever from Playstation. Customer service is everything!< /Text>

I contacted them today regarding charges on my account in which I spoke with Melissa who was awful. Could not give me information regarding the charges when we have no games purchased on our console but $145.29 in charges which doesn't make sense. We will be selling our console to Gamestop and not purchasing any products ever from Playstation. Customer service is everything!<//Review>

Sony PlayStation demands far to much personal information if you want to register on their website and there is no real way to actually contact them because you get shuttled off to some forum which many game companies are using to derail user input to a rather impotent medium where you do not actually get any company replies or action.</Text>
