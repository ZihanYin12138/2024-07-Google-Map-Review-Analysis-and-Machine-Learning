Very affordable and tasty food! Love how clean their restaurant is. Fresh and lots of variety available. Good customer service, sufficient amount of wait time. Wish they were open more hours though and I wish I lived closer to their location. This is probably our favorite Kabob places because we like everything about it.< /Text>

They have really good food. I love their chicken & lamb plates especially. Their hummus is literally the best hummus ever. If nothing else, just try their hummus. It is sooooooooo good.< /Review>

<Text>Eat here almost 1x per week and everything on the menu is good. Favorites are the standard lamb gyro (spicy) and the Kabobs. Hummus is above average. I would go 5 stars but the wraps have the too high of a bread to meat ratio, they don’t make their own pitas plus they won’t put my face on their wall no matter how much I order.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyDxha5nA2HMtfgQoiU_33QpYBoTQovs8Y5BcJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Generous portions, friendly staff and decent prices. Fairly decent drink selection but its the only part of the menu that could use an upgrade. Very nice calm atmosphere and a relaxing place to sit for a longer lunch. Especially if you want multiple courses or items from the menu. I could definitely do two rounds here but I'm a hungry boy.
Sparse outdoor seating but it's there. Nice quiet part of Walnut Creek. Pretty authentic Mediterranean feel and taste.<//Review>

This place makes exquisite dolmas, and their falafels are crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful inside.  Every dish and side is expertly prepared on a consistent basis.  The Turkish Coffee is a must-try as well.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I tried this Mediterranean place at the last minute and I have to say the food was pretty good. The servers were pleasant but busy.  Thry didn't have a lot of time for small talk. The place was small,  seating was a little tight but that's to be expected in a grab-and-go type of establishment like this. Honestly I walked out of there really wanting to give this place at least 4 stars or better but I have to only give it two.  I really should give it one but I'm giving it two because I don't like to bash smaller mom-and-pop establishments. The reason I scored it low was simply because not a single glove was worn by anyone behind the counter and there is no substitution for cleanliness.  I stood there and watched as the cook and the person taking the order in the person serving the food to the people seated we're touching food and knives and plastic bags without wearing a single glove on their hand.  I hope the owner of this restaurant sees this and makes that simple change it really does make a difference. I would go back once that change is made.<//text>

Got there 30 minutes before closing last night. They were all cleaned up and ready to close but gladly took our order. My kids got a lamb plate and chicken salad. My husband and I got lamb gyros, his with a hot sauce. The chicken on my daughter's salad was so flavorful! The lamb was so amazing and tender. My gyro was so good. The gyro meat was seasoned so well, so much flavor! If we weren't from out of town, I would be a regular here.</Text>

Food is great, but taking 2 stars off for delivery via styrofoam. Please use compostable or at the very least recyclable containers. Until then we won't reorder delivery/takeout unfortunately.<//review>

My usual place for lunch at work. Their chicken wraps are damn tasty, and for a reasonable (by Walnut Creek standards) price. Good stuff.<//Text>

Babalou's is an excellent option for cheap, (fairly) fast Mediterranean food. There are a few places I like more in San Francisco, but for Contra Costa County I'd definitely put them at the top.

Their falafel and schwarma (both chicken and lamb) are very tasty. And they have a great hot sauce. Humus is also spot on in flavor. And I really appreciate that they serve their sandwiches in a wrap versus pita - much easier to eat and tastier given it's easier to spread the flavors around.<//Text>

THE WORST MEDITARIANIAN FOOD I'VE HAD!

I give them two stars because the service was fast.

We got the chicken garlic wrap, chicken plate, chicken salad, lamb gyro, lamb plate, side falafel and fries. The chicken is salty af and definitely not spit cooked. The lamb is oily but bearable. The hummus doesn't have garlic or limes. The falafel was flashed fried, the outside was dark and the inside mushy. The fries undercooked but that could be because we went during the last hour and they wanted to leave.

I personally ordered the chicken garlic wrap which was mostly bread. It had no sauce or spicy sauce, it only contained a spares amount of chicken, lettuce and tomato.

As a middle eastern, I was truly disappointed. Definitely go to The Mediterranean for legit wraps in the East Bay!</Text>

<review>Falafels are great. Atmosphere is very casual. Fun murals on walls. No alcohol. Portions aren't huge but the price is very reasonable, about $8 for a Falafel plate, 5 falafels plus a salad/side of choice, plus hummus and pita bread. 4 stars because staff wasn't friendly. One rude employee /owner? got into a fulblown argument in front of the diners with a customer who hadn't done anything wrong. It was unnecessary and unprofessional.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

These guys are the best. We ordered our food an hour ahead of time enroute to Walnut Creek but got stuck behind a really bad accident on HWY 12 we called and told them we would be late but we showed up an hour and a half late....the owner threw away our food and remade it for us at no charge. The guy is a really amazing dude only second to his incredible food. Highly recommend Bobalous, they're awesome people with even better food!</Review>

<Text>The workers attitude is very bad specially the bald guy, the lamb gyro was very bad, half of the wrap was bread, very little salad, no hummus or tahini, i do not recommend this place for anyone.</Text>< Date>

Very very bad place to eat, from salads which is not fresh, Falafel which was over fried. The place was not clean and the staff there they serve you as if it was given for free. No smiles and no courtesy ...</Text>

I must have gone on a day they decided to put in only half the ingredients in their Shawerma(their spelling, I have seen it spelled differently)as though I had ordered the child's size.  It was early in the day so they should have had enough ingredients.  Also the wrap portion was burned a lot.  While there was only 1 other customer my order took forever.  Daphne's is a much better choice for Mediterranean food while in WC. Still need to find a good Schwarma place in the bay area.< /review>

<Review>Wow. Best mediterranean food I've ever had. 1) The falaffel is off the charts (AND IT'S GLUTEN FREE!) 2) Best Hummus I've ever had. I ate far too much, and now have a stomach ache, but it was well worth it. 3) Chicken very flavorful and moist 4) Rice had great flavor, very tasty. 4) Dolmas--incredible! Downsides--the atmosphere doesn't do the food justice. I wouldn't take a first date here. Also wasn't a fan of the mediterranean salad, it was soggy. Definitely give this place a shot!!< /Review><user_id>102097886965979655612<//user_id>< pictures>

<text>Got there early and got a parking space pretty easily. About 1.5 mile hike to the location. Beautiful clean clear water. Plenty of areas to set up for the day. If you’re looking specifically to go to Hoyts Crossing, be warned that there are A LOT of naked men. Not in a gross way, everyone was respectful, but something to be aware of. I read a ton of reviews before going and I wasn’t prepared for that level of nudity. This is a NUDE beach!! Enjoy</text>< pics>

Beautiful place to get away from it all. Meditate, relax, sunbathe or swim. Hiking trails forever. Really neat place to be.<//Review>

Secluded spot. Be prepared to hike for 15 minutes before you reach the spot. The water is clean and cold but swimmable in even in May. The place is known to be Nude beach and I did see a lot of Nude people so be prepared for that.<//Text>

It was a long hike,  but it was so beautiful! Well worth the effort.  I wouldn't take children smaller than 6 or 7 on the trail.  There's a couple of spots that are a little iffy,  with REALLY long  drops! Don't let little ones run ahead!< /review>

Great 1 mile hike with it’s beautiful surroundings ending with two lovely pools of water!  Don’t take your children if you are uncomfortable with nudity as many folks don’t wear clothes!<//review>

Always wonderful scenery and stays remarkably clean. Went on 3/27 and the water was low for February. Always plan to have to hunt for parking. Not always guaranteed you'll get a place in the lot.<//text>

I actually grew up in this area, and used to spend the summers along this part of the river, but now am living in Nevada; Decided to take a drive down on sunday to see it again, and the drive was worth it! The water is so clear on the entire river, and Hoyt's Crossing has some seriously fun natural slides along the rock faces.
Also do feel that it should be noted that it is a nude beach, and a popular one at that.< /Review>

What an absolute TREAT it was to visit the Yuba River just north of Nevada City, California.  I was completely blown away at the COLOR, and the ROCKS!  Although we could not really swim in the river, we did manage to find a spot in between the rocks at Hoyts Crossing, to relax in the river, while Harold swam back & forth between on, while on leash. I would like to explore this area of California even further, to find the perfect swimming hole, where the pup can be offleash.</Text>

My favorite place to go to when it's hot out. If you go on the trail you only need to go a little bit to get away from the crowd. Nice and refreshing. Also, watch out for some nakies... They like to wander.</Text>

This is a NUDE BEACH and it has been for nearly 50 years. Please don’t come and get your pants in a wad because you see naked people. Lighten up and take off your clothes, you’ll feel much better if you do :)</text>

This is hands down THE best mechanic shop I've ever been to. I am a customer for life. Best prices. Quality work. Honest. Reasonable. And they're personable! Treat you like you're a family friend. Truly the only place I'll take my car from now till I'm dead.< /Text>

Lee's is a family owned auto repair shop. I have been coming to them for than 5 years. I can honestly say I have never met a more honest auto repair shop. They will not rip you off. Tell them Kevin sent you.<//Text>

<review>Lee's Auto Repair is the only shop I'll go to from now on. They're honest and the prices they charge are more than fair. They don't do everything, but what they do is done right, done quickly, and done at a very reasonable rate.

Every other shop I talked to wanted $500 or more to put a new water pump in my old Acura; Lee's did it for $330.<//review>< user>

I brought my 6 year old car in for a 100,000 mile maintenance, referred to me by a friend. I had a number of parts that needed to be replaced (spark plugs, air filters, serpentine belts & etc.). They broke down part prices plus labor so I knew exactly what I was paying for. They gave me a good price and they had it done in just a few hours. I would definitely recommend them!<//Review>

I went there with a $130 quote for a diagnostic which grew to $500 without it being fixed and when I picked up the car the bill said $630 and my car runs worse then it ever has. They ended up rigging the wires and by passing the computer which I didn't want. I paid for them to learn or practice on my car. In the end Francisco told me to F-off and never come back...WHY? BECAUSE I SPIKE THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF HIS OTHER CUSTOMER AND EXPOSED HIM FOR THE HACKER HE IS.</review>

Got my ac repair, electrical and check engine light 🕯️ finally repaired. Although I drive an older car 🚗 francisco still took care of me. Some oc mechanics would just tell me buy a new car. But francisco knows cars very well and is one of those mechanics who can just drive your car and can tell what is wrong immediately. This kind of experience is why i keep coming back and will recommend Francisco to family and friends.< /text>

Came in for an oil change and head light replacement. Left with an 800 dollar bill and more parts broken than fixed. USED to be a reputable mechanic but seems they hired a bunch of scam artists instead. Avoid this place!!</review>

Francisco helped us out with a repair on our family's RV on a Saturday afternoon. He didn't turn us down, but rather told us to come right over. They diagnosed and fixed the problem quickly, even when other places wouldn't even look at the vehicle because it's a motorhome. Excellent, friendly service! Would definitely recommend!<//Text>

Last week my car shut down on me in the middle of the road. I was stuck but Francisco got me a towing service quickly. He diagnosed the problem and fixed my car very quickly. He was able to charge me less than the dealer and even gave me a list of upcoming services I need to look into. He is the best in the industry. HIGHLY RECOMMEND him.</Review>

Absolutely the best! We have been going to Francisco nearly 30 years. He even helped our son recently over the phone for hours when he broke down in Baja. He is the reason he made it Home in his own car! He did the same for us 15 years ago when we had fuel injector issues. Thank you!</Review>

< Review>
I'd gone to this place when my check engine light went on and the owner told me they found nothing. When he talked to me about the charge he told me that it was a usual of $115, but he would just charge me $55. I knew that he was a shady character the moment he mentioned the money issue. I never went back.
I'd gone to plenty of other auto shops when my check engine light went on and if there was nothing wrong they didn't charge me. I don't recommend this place at all and those considering - BEWARE. You take your chances.</Review>

<Text>Francisco is the best! He is always so honest, so quick, and his staff is so knowledgeable! My husband would not take his Jeep anywhere else because no one can be trusted like Francisco! They have a little waiting area that you can use while your car is being fixed, or they will drop you off at work and come pick you up later if you need it! It's so convenient and so nice of them.</Text>< gmapID>

Francisco was super helpful. He fixed my car door that was basically falling apart. They do not make my door anymore cause my car is so old but he found a way to fix it without charging me a ton of money. My door feels brand new. Definitely recommend going to him!</Review>

A convincing con-artist. I used Francisco on a few occasions over time and was duped into believing his BS in the beginning until it finally dawned on me what this guys 3 step business model is, and that is;
- Charm the customer that its all in good hands.
- He gives a verbal approximate quote that seems reasonable.
- When the job is done the final bill is always 40-50% above what he quoted verbally initially with some BS story of challenges encountered, tinged with him trying to be charming.
Be warned about Francisco. Don’t trust this guy, tell him to put a quote in writing before you give any ok for repairs.</Text>

<Text>I have been taking our family vehicles to Francisco's for over 12 years and have recommended them to others. Their work is thorough and prices, while not cheap, are fair. Having the ability to speak to someone very familiar with the work performed on the vehicle versus a person who merely writes up the service order is big advantage over the service departments of auto dealerships.< /Text>< Rate>

Francisco always always takes care of my car. I needed to get it smogged and he fixed a whole bunch of issues that meant I wasn't going to pass. When I took it over to the smog place across the way, there was a loose connection, so the technician sent me back over to Francisco's. The owner himself came out and fixed the hose no charge!

I will always come here because the quality is completely unmatched. It's so good to have my own mechanic that I can trust.<//Review>

<Text>Cars just don't like me but, thankfully Francisco’s Automotive  is always there to fix whatever happens to my car or my wife’s! They're very well priced, very efficient, and very customer service oriented! Leah and Francisco not only are great to work with but, everyone is friendly and nice to each other. It seems like everyone is happy to be there.

So I’ve had batteries die, my car's ac condenser started leaking (yes, in the summer), I knocked off my side mirror,  we've had Francisco work with my insurance company with no hassle. They even helped us with rides home from the shop and always calls with an update on when we can pick the cars up. This place is great I'll take my car there for anything that goes wrong! Customers for life!< /Text>< pictures>

Francisco was recommended by a relative and friend
after having the dealer tell me that there was nothing wrong with my car. I decided to go to Fransisco to give him a try, and it was one of the best decisions I could of made. Not only did he drive my car but he found the problem and fixed it the same day. I am sooo greatful for his business and I wish there were more mechanics like him</Review>

I will never use these guys again. I will probably take them to court to get my money back since they also refused to refund me on their misdiagnosis.<//Text>< Pics>

<Time>1377922572047</Time><review>This place is AWESOME!!  I recommend Francisco's Auto Repair for professional and trustworthy service. We live in LA and my car broke down because of a cracked radiator in the Huntington Beach area and I had no idea where to take my car to be fixed. We first had the car towed the local Pep Boys and they gave me a ridiculously high estimate. Fortunately, we looked online again and found Francisco's. Eric and Leah were incredibly helpful and gave us a very fair estimate for replacing the radiator and 2 tires. They were also very fast...our car was ready to be picked up the same day that we dropped it off. They even surprised us and had it washed. What more could you ask for! Thank you!!<//review></record>

Toyota refused to replace my back brakes or give me a refund. I brought my car to Francisco and not only did he replace my brakes he noticed that my tires were bald. Toyota failed to mention the tires needing to be replaced. I commute three hours a day and the tires could have blown out at any time!! They even picked me up and dropped me off saving me the hassle of finding a ride! Awesome service and friendly atmosphere, 2 thumbs way up!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>So i have been using Francisco’s Automotive for years but just getting to a review of them after my most recent visit.

I first heard about them through a friend who would take his finicky Audi to them from time to time. They always did good for him so I decided to trust them with the 3 cars in my household. What I love about them is that they don't up sell you and they give you options that can fit your budget without cutting corners or making your car unreliable. I really appreciate that level of help and service.

For my most recent visit, I brought in a car for routine maintenance for a road trip to Texas. My mind was put at ease with their work and inspection for potential problems.<//Review>< pictures>

Was charged three hundred dollars more. After work was done checked pricing with local dealer.
Francisco is a true BS artist salesman. Stay away.< /text>

Tried to tell me i needed a new door at the cost of over 1000 dollars when it wouldn't stay closed. I told a friend at work and he was able to fix it within minutes. He also charged me a 100 dollar fee to estimate it, which he did refund upon my complaining. No good</review>

My smog did not pass, he told me to drop the car, he charged me $108 for a diagnostic only.  The repairs fees too high.  I took my car to Santa Ana, fixed and pass for $100 only.  Live and learn.<//review>

I have been going to Francisco’s since 1987.  This shop always keeps my vehicles running in great shape and reminds me without pressure, when service is due.  There are many things I like about this establishment.  First and foremost is trust integrity.  I can count on Francisco himself to ensure my vehicle is safe at his shop and that he and his trained staff have my best interest in mind.  Let’s face it; I typically visit this shop when my vehicle needs maintenance.  As a result, I am not in the best spirits because I know this is going to cost money.  Francisco knows this ensures that me that I’m not being take advantage of.  He all provides a complete breakdown of costs and replaces items with OEM parts.  Yes, that is expensive but, that’s the price of car ownership.  Unfortunately, I’ve learned the hard way by taking my vehicle elsewhere; only have Francisco clean up someone else’s subpar repair.  Francisco does what it takes to explain things and perhaps a learning opportunity for me to mitigate possible damage to the car going forward.  Finally, I’ve learned that Francisco actually saves me money by providing advice based on his many years of training and the talented staff he has on board.  I feel really lucky to have solid business partnership with Francisco and I look forward to Francisco and his trained staff to provide me the excellent care for my automotive needs and address my concerns professionally.  Today, it is very difficult to find these attributes as part of the DNA in the automotive repair business and takes pride in the service they provide.<//Text>

< Review>
My husband and I had them yesterday. He order the beef gyro and I had the lamb chops. They gyro was ok nice flavor but way too crispy almost too dry. Not sure if it’s due to he heat being turned up too high or from them being on heat way too long. The lamb chops were very tender even with me ordering them well done. Which I very much appreciated, but they definitely lacked in flavor. I’m not sure why it’s such a big deal for them to also charge for condiments either especially with the food not having a lot of flavor. I was highly disappointed in that ... I paid $20 for lamp chops and you expect me to eat them dry? The audacity! I loved the freshness of the salad, the pita bread was weird ( very thin and hard). The hot sauce was different not a good taste by itself. Overall I’ll give them a three because the freshness of the salad I really loved and if you get their “cucumber” sauce and hot sauce and eat everything together it compliments.  Overall, I would eat there again it wasn’t bad I’ve just had way better but with the lack of good food places in Fresno there’s not much to choose from in my opinion.< /Review>

<text>On Saturday I ordered food for my husband’s 50th birthday party. There was a little mix up on my part when I ordered the food because I didn’t realize they had 2 locations so unfortunately when I called to confirm and pay for the order I reordered the food at the wrong location. When I went to pick it up at their Tollhouse location they said it wasn’t paid for because I ordered it again at their Champlain location!!  Boy did I mess them up!!  They were so kind and understanding the corrected the error and I got home with the food  just in time before the guest arrived. Everyone at the party ( our immediate family) just raved at the food,  it was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I will definitely order from them again. That you to their staff!!!<//text><Resp>{'time': 1619499678673, 'text': 'Thank you Charlene.'}<//Resp><Rate>5< /Rate>< UserId.>

<text>Pita bread is so tough it's inedible. Also their Gyro meat is pretty much a cheap sausage. We tried many things and the only good item was their Pilaf. 10/10 would not recommend coming here. The kids chicken was so sour it was like biting into a lime. Very disappointing.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Post quarantine Ark not the same quality. Loved this place as they opened the first few months. A la carte kabob chicken juicy and big pieces. Went back today, ordered same as always and got a mini(before was normal size) bowl with dried burnt chicken kabob and the chicken luleh was the same.
Hope it was a fluke.<//review>< Pictures>

Beef was some of the most tender I've tried, and the chicken breast was extremely moist. Also had the lamb wrap, delicious. Hummus could have been smoother, and had a bit more tahini/garlic/lemon juice... It was a bit falafel tasting... But was still good. Very nice staff.<//text>< Pictures>

Talk about technical!!! I want to shake the person's hand who not only envisioned disc golf here but made it happen!!! My hats of to You. This course is crazy thick wooded area which you can't believe your throwing your disc without losing them all. If It goes off some of the edges it's gone. This course is so much fun and a very tough hike, not a place for kids. The signage is great or you wouldn't have a clue where to head next. You must experience this course and it makes my home course seem wimpy. DeLa course is nearby so it's a great duo to golf both on a trip. If this was helpful please give me a like.</text>

<Review>Beautiful 18 hole disc golf course set on wooded hills above a primary school. Most holes can be played while school is happening, though a few that are close to the school are closed before 3pm.  Lots of underbrush, it is easy to loose discs. Also there is a lot of poison oak in some areas so beware.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< username>

An excellent disc golf course behind the school. A medium-small course with a good amount of hills and gorgeous redwoods.<//review>

Wow this course was difficult! It didn't help this was my first time playing. Lost a few discs as there is major brush everywhere. The only gripe I have is the maps of the holes are not the most clear. Also really easy to get lost or go to the wrong hole. But overall awesome and if I get better I will be back!</text>

Bollywood bites is a favorite of mine, such great Indian food so close to campus- perfect for those chill nights in with friends. 10/10 would recommend, take out or delivery, always a great addition to the night. So tasty!</review>

The price they charged me was more than what was on the menu. When I asked about it they said the prices had changed. Maybe they are struggling but tricking customers is not a good business strategy. Food was okay. I've had better and I've had worse. Also, maybe worth mentioning they give you 10% off if you write a good google review, so I don't know how trustworthy all the reviews are.< /Text>

This restaurant is my favored. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this place I keep coming back again and again. The team is very helpful and the cooking they offer is so good. I am always happy to have a decent meal here. Highly recommended.< /Review>

Ordered pad mee with chicken and got take out. Portions were huge! I saved some for the next day. I mistakenly poured all the hot sauce into my dish, and it was extremely spicy. The noodles were a little dry, but they weren't bad. I love the texture of the noodles, and will be back to try other items! My friend got the papaya salad and i had a bite, and it was so fresh!</Text>

I got the thaali. The chicken saag is luxurious, the raita is creamy and the naan is fresh. Skip the rajma. Too much gram masala. Watch out for the dressing on the salad.< /Review>

We had some appetizers and desserts. We tried Ahi Tuna Tartar, Caesar salad and Wild  Mushroom Risotto. The tuna tartar was the best meal which I've ever tried!  Food is overall pretty good.
We enjoyed our appetizers. The best part was a dessert. We ended our dinner with California Almond Cake with a fresh berries.

Definitely check them out if I'll be in this area again. You won't be disappointed!< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc83b11d4cf9:0x7a9dcf6c600074ca</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

LOVE THIS PLACE!! I am vegetarian so sometimes my order can be complicated, but the waitress was so patient and made all my accommodations without attitude or giving me a hard time. The food here is AMAZING on top of the excellent customer service. I only tried it once but it is now my favorite Thai food place in all of Los Angeles!!< /review>

Haven't been here in a while as there are lots of sushi options in Montrose. My last visit left me really impressed. Great customer service! Service was very friendly and attentive. Presentation was on point and most importantly everything was really tasty! We got a complimentary ceviche that I'll definitely be ordering on my next trip there. My daughter loved her k-BBQ and tempura combo. It's always great to find a sushi spot that has options for my non-sushi eating child.<//review>

Vegetarian Thali was good with delicious Dal and bhindi curry. Below average Hyderabadi biryani!! If you are looking to eat an authentic Hyderabadi biryani well this is not a place! For Owner:Kindly work with chef to male at least decent Hyderabadi biryani or change the name! May be you can name In-house biryani. Hyderabadi biryani has a history and kindly don’t take it for granted by providing a biryani which is not!! From Biryani lover<//Review>

<Review>This is an absolutely top curry house. I lived in the UK for 25 years but have been in the US for the last 6. My brother is a regular here and he is raving about this place that is "better than Sangam".
Never thought I would find such a place but it is REALLY good. Lots of flavour in the relishes that are served with the pops. The starter of samosa was very good as well.< /Review>< Rate>

I visit this spot a lot since I work right next to it. I got to say the customer service is always excellent and they keep the spot well organized at all times. Rates are convenient and they serve big portions.<//review>

Came here on Saturday lunch time.
dumpling was good, but the dumpling wrappers was very thick.
Waitress was friendly and attentive.
Will be back again.< /review>

The mango is sweet, not like other restaurants that sometimes serve with sour mango instead of sweet. The sweet roti was made just crispy enough that it was not burned. Definitely will order again.</Review>< Pictures>

I'm glad this place is working during the COVID and has beautiful outside seating. Portions are huge! I didn't eat even a half of mine and took it with me after a great dinner :) everything tastes wonderful, prices are a little bit higher than average.< /Review>

< Review>
Price point is similar to the places next door, about $20-$30 per person, more if you get appetizers. A strawberry lemonade was $6 which is pretty ludicrous if you ask me but a pretty view and great customer service make up for that. We ordered clam chowder cups and I wish I got the bowl because it was soooo good. For entrees my partner got the fried platter and I got the ciopinno. Huge portions, nice flavor. Would I get it again? No.  But I would definitely come here again and try the lobster and scallop risotto and yeah, get a bigger order of soup.< /Review>

Best Indian restaurant so far in US I have been to, took my parents visiting from India and they accolade well big party and served best Indian street food (believe me they were as authentic as can be in India...loved Pani puri, samosa chaat, Brel puri). My big foodie ordered lot of main authentic items Chicken Tikka Masala, Bhindi Masala, Tandoori Kabob, Fish coconut curry, Hyderabadi biryani; saffron rice. Loved fresh out of tandoor butter naan, spinach naan. and as Indian needed with fresh warm gulag jammuns. Two thumps up to this cozy place, my go to Indian place from now.</text>

Don't let the "bakery" in name confuse you, they have all the usual  plates and dishes you can expect in most Mediterranean places and way more.
I chose Beed Shawarma Plate. It came pretty fast, considering they had almost full house. The plate comes with freshly baked pita bread right from the oven. The meat was delicious and the side hummus was generous. I only wish they had some traditional homemade sauce instead of bag of ketchup that comes with fries. But other than that, everything was perfect, can't think of a better lunch!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Clam Chowder- tasty, rich and flavorful. Had chunks of potato in it. Option to top it with crab for an additional $7.
Crab tater tots- crispy tater tots with truffle oil, a cream sauce and pieces of dungeness crab. Served with lemon. Delicious and truffle wasn't too strong.
Special shout out to our server, Gia who was extremely attentive, helpful and knowledgeable about the food. Great service!<//Review><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

OMG. I don't know if it's that we just came back from living in Japan where food is on the bland side and it's hard to find ethnic food. But damn this place is good! The chicken shawarma comes with this garlic dip that is thick, spicy, and soooo good. The staff was so nice and we were able to sub out sides without any problems. We chose the eggplant dip. So good.< /review>

I would never go back to this place. Kathi roll was just a chapati roll stuffed with paneer tikka masala(gravy). sev puri and bhel puri were decent tasting. And they should rename pav bhaaji to veg kadai with bread. And this is not how the "Indian street food" tastes.<//text>

<Text>Wow i am amazed by the boneless chicken.. i got the whole boneless chicken with sweet and sour sauce and garlic jam and wow the crispy was ON POINT no way chicken can get any more softer and the sauces were amazing. I moved here literally today to this area and this was the first restaurant i tried cause the restaurant name was funny "korean" joke. But im not leaving this comment cause someone told me too. Im sure the restaurant owner knows exactly who i am when i picked up the chicken, i told her ill leave the most honest review. Look at my past reviews unless its super good or super bad i dont post comments. This places is a MUST! La koreatown chicken is a bye bye<//Text>< pics>

<text>Tried Bollywood Bites for the first time. Ordered bhindi, yellow daal, veggie naan wrap, aaloo paratha, plain naan, pack bhaaji- and seriously everything was delicious. We ordered our food to go and it was ready in 10 minutes and packed very nicely. Portion sizes were great. Definitely coming back. We thought that Bollywood bites may have been mainly just street food but their actual food for a main meal was really good.<//text>< user_id>

Bollywood bites is the first Indian restaurant I ever went too and it made me love Indian food. Try this place if you’re in Westwood. Also you get 10% off your check if you write a google review.</Text>

My teenage nephew who is from out of town, loves their food. Me too! So, we drove over 50 miles just for bite! Good food, friendly crew. Its near UCLA so I see a lot of locals and visiting families eating there.</Review>

Hmm...this place just keeps degrading in quality of food. I use to go to the other location in sherman oaks and the quality started good and then just started to drop and eventually closed. Feels like a lot of it is poor customer service, the owner/manager is definitely stingy/stressed out/money driven lol that's why his business is doing bad. Sorry it's the truth, trying to help. They messed up on my order, i drove back to their location to replace the order, and insteadd of the owner apologizing/showing gratitude/providing discount for driving twice for their mistake, he still charged. That's how you know the character of the restaurant and service!! Best advice and guarantee your restaurant quality will improve in all ways!! Provide service with care, love, kindness, engage with your customers, show appreciation/gratitude when you make a mistake, your customer will appreciate it and recommend more people! Stop being stingY and money ddriven, that's what's driving your business to the ground!! Show gratitude and appreciation towards your customers,  talk to them, smile, show you actually care!!! Can't emphasize it more, don't let your ego get in the way!! Thank you!! Btw I'm going to be returing the dish I got last night, completely terrible!! Again shows how much they even care lol this one will shut down soon if the owner doesn't step it up in terms of caring!!<//review>

<user_name>Arnav Ramkrishnan<//user_name><review>Everything about the place is good, except some of the food itmes given the prices they charge. The gravy of most curries don't feel authentic even at the "spiciest" choice.

I usually get samosa chaat, which on some days is really good and on some days below average with too much curd/sourness. It's evident that two different chefs prepare them in two very distinct styles, and everytime I order it I'm basically playing a food roulette.< /review>< gmap_id>

Doesn't taste anything like Indian food. The food was actually sweet, as if they opened a can of tomato sauce and threw it on too of the chicken. The server was nice, but otherwise the food was terrible.< /text>

Food is okay, but the service is so poor. I ordered 30 minutes ahead so the food would be ready and still had to wait 25 minutes just to get two items on the menu. This is ridiculous. Oh, and it’s overpriced. Taking my business elsewhere in the future.< /text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>There's nothing like the chicken rasala at any Indian restaurant I've been to. It's a coconut curry that they'll make as hot or mild as you want. A huge thing for me is if they're on point with refilling your water...this spot is one of the best in SF for that. I do think the food is a little on the pricey side, but it's not bad for SF. Lots of space here, good music, and the decorations are awesome. I definitely recommend it.<//Review>< pictures>

{'time': 1537723571982, 'text': 'Dear JJ, I believe you have made an error. Bollywood Bites Indian restaurants are open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.  None of our staff would ever turn away a customer during our business hours. There is clearly some type of error here...'}</Resp>
<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Poor customer service. Door was open and we arrived at 4:57 pm. He said they weren't open yet and that we needed to come back at 5 pm. We were taken aback since we thought we should be just seated at a table to and allowed to start looking at a menu (or they shouldn't have unlocked the door). But the person said, "Yes, please (leave)." So we did (and didn't go back).

Management responded to say that we must have the wrong Bollywood Bites. We are talking about the same place. Because we were turned away, we went next door to Musashiya Udon also on Gayley (where the service was excellent). We suggest you consider believing that your (turned-away) customers have nothing to gain by writing a review sharing a real experience but that maybe one of their employees might have self-interest in not admitting what really happened.< /Text>< user_id>

The food is alright but I never got what I asked for. Like I asked for a Alacart item And the next thing I noticed is that I got thali with the Alacart order. Like I wonder if that guy even listened to my order properly.</text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>I live in Westwood and have walked past this place a number of times. Curious, this past Saturday afternoon, I decided to drop in for takeaway. I went inside, smiling, happy, and the guy there walked slowly over to me at the door. There was no one else inside. I asked, “so, what should I get here if I were to never eat here again?” He said, “what, you’re from out of town, or what?” I said, “no, I live around the corner. What’s the best thing here? What’s your favorite?” He says, unengaged, “what, do you want chicken or vegetables or what?” I said, “what’s your favorite dish here?” He rolled his eyes. I said, “what, you’re not into the food, or what?” He said, “so, do you want to eat here or take away, what do you want?” I said, “never mind, thank you, have a nice day.” and went down the street to spend my money on food somewhere else. Zero customer service. I left feeling confused and puzzled. And hungry. I wanted to give you my money for good food and a good experience. At some point I’d like to drop in and try the food, hopefully greeted by a kind helpful customer oriented staff member. This is half the experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

3.5 Stars. Excellent dinner meal value. Only problem was the tray I was given had compartments, so there was tikka masala spilled onto my salad and all in the bag. Containers may be expensive, but a few cents will keep customers happy and returning, willing to spend more. No quasi-mandatory upsell from the voucher I purchased in advance; very friendly service.<//Review>

The place was not crowded at all but still they took almost 40 mins to get the order. Being an Indian I understand that the intensity of spice in Indian food here in the US is lowered to fit the pallet of non-Indians. Been to a lot of Indian restaurants in LA but this one was wayy to off the mark. The aloo Gobhi felt like they had just boiled and added some turmeric without any spices.</Review>< pics>

Went to dine-in about 30 mins before close and they said we could only get take out. They said it would be ten minutes, it took 15.

We asked for water and they brought one glass for my friend and I. I had to request a glass for myself which seemed to inconvenience the staff.

The food was overpriced, my friend is from India and she was not satisfied at all. I thought it was okay quality but the portions are small for the price.

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but the food is not terrible. Their customer service was awful, they weren't very welcoming and they acted like we were unwanted guests. Maybe they were just having a bad night.</review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Very small but colorful Indian restaurant in Westwood. It was VERY noisy the night we were there. Our waitress was very meek and not very attentive. I had a lamb korma thali and mango lassi and asked for it very mild. My husband has a chicken street dish (we don't remember the name of it) and asked for it spicy. My food came out spicy and his mild. The waitress never came around to check on us so we couldn't even tell her. We kept trying to flag her down but she never looked up (even though she only had one other table). The food was really delicious though and I'd eat there again in a heartbeat. My husband really enjoyed his food too. Only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because the waitress wasn't very good and got our order wrong regarding the spices.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Excellent Indian Restaurant!  I get Bollywood Bites regularly now since they make excellent renditions of curries.  The Chana Masala in particular is the best I've seen in almost any restaurant (Which means a lot considering I'm Indian).  The naans are always fresh and baked just the right amount.  I recommend the restaurant to any one who wants to try some great Indian food.< /text>< Pictures>

As an Indian, the prices (for us) are slightly prohibitive. Food was good, but you could say that the it was americanized for the local pallette.
Very friendly folks and who were nice enough to change the menu offering to accommodate our meal.</review>

<text>Seems a little pricey, but I had a lovely lunch--eggplant bharti and daal--with extremely friendly service.  Small and spare space (maybe 40 people fit in here?).  Intimate, not crowded.  I will come back.< /text>< pics>

2 star food. 1 star service.

- 1 star waitress (Saturday 12/9 - 6 PM). Young lady full negligent attitude.

Short review- stay away.

Longer version. Took forever for waitress to take order (long after we indicated we were ready). Slow night, so not over-worked.
Actually, we were taken aback to see the place mostly empty on a Saturday night. I guess the locals know the score....

More on service. Finally got to order. Expected to get naan bread 1st like every other 100+ times I've had Indian Food, but no.........    and no waitress or water ever came to table to inquire (or even make eye contact ). And ya- nobody ever asked to refill water.

The food? Tepid quality. Curry chicken- meh. Tandoori shrimp - zzzz. Paneer - THEY F'd up my order Asked for tofu, got cheese.

This place is like an old dog who no longer performs the tricks it once knew...

Stay way. STAY AWAY!!<//review>

(Translated by Google) I had an Indian buffet and the taste is very good. It is 13 dollars per person, but tax and tip are separate. It was great to be able to taste various curry.

(Original)
인도 뷔페를 먹었는데 맛이 썩 괜찮습니다. 1인 13불인데 세금이랑 팁은 따로. 다양한 커리를 양껏 맛 볼 수 있어서 좋았어요.</review>

This segment of the coastline along Ocean View Blvd is a favorite. The mix of rocky bluffs and small sandy coves (particularly at low tide) creates a visual feast for photography and relaxing. Sunsets along this curve of the shoreline can be spectacular and there is plenty of space for it not to feel crowded.<//text>

Whether you just want to relax, enjoy one of the best sunsets ever or you just want to take one of the best shots of a sunset ever, this is the location to do it. You can be on your car, right on the beach or on the rock (if the tide lets you), any place would allow you to enjoy this unique experience.< /review>

Really really REALLY enjoyed this beach! 😁 Beautiful scenery. Quiet. Not a lot of people/overcrowded. The sand here is really large sized and has LOTS of shells/oddities to sort through and find. Could easily spend a few hours here with your kids combing the beach and checking out the tide pools.< /Review>

<time>1576156950370< /time><rating>5</rating><text>(Translated by Google) There is a very nice path along the coast to go for a walk, which is much used, because there are great trails. But even to see the sunset come here many people and sit in their cars or walk along there and wait until the sun has set behind the horizon and the beautiful color play has an end.
I was there in November and it blew a pretty breeze, so taking jackets with can be very fresh, maybe they sat in their cars because it was too cold for them.

There is a great way to walk along the coast which is great because there are great trails. The sky is beautiful and the view is over.
I was there in November and it blew a very nice breeze so you could sit in their cars because it was too cold for them.

(Original)
Es gibt dort einen sehr schönen Weg der Küste entlang zum spazieren gehen, der viel genutzt wird, denn es gibt hier toll angelegte Wege . Doch auch nur um den Sonnenuntergang zu sehen kommen hier viele Menschen und sitzen in ihren Autos oder spazieren dort entlang und warten bis die Sonne hinter dem Horizont unter gegangen ist und das schöne Farbspiel ein Ende hat.
Ich war im November dort und es blies eine ganz schöne Briese, also auch Jacken mit nehmen kann sehr frisch werden, vielleicht saßen sie auch deswegen in ihren Autos weil es ihnen zu kalt war.

<review>Good track and friendly owner. Been going for over 6 months but will be finished after today. Randy who works till owner arrives is killing business. His people skills are horrible, does not explain general rules to new people, can't get more than 1 word answer out of him. Beginners don't come back. If you had a person who could take some time to help new people with questions or track setup you could keep customers. I am done with lsr till things are changed to make it a more family friendly atmosphere.<//review>< Time>

Great place to learn rc racing! You gotta ask questions and do your homework as a beginner. I was having strange behavior from my car and Randy; staff member, took a look and applied his skills to get me back on the track in no time! Sensor cable $6.oo! Thanks Randy/LSR for providing a place to satisfy my passion for rc racing!< /text>

I recently purchased a Rad Rover 5 e-bike. I had the bike shipped to velofix for assembly. They assembled my bike and delivered the bike one week earlier than expected. The velofix van was very clean and well organized. The bike mechanic Nick was also very helpful in explaining how to operate my new bike. Thanks!! I will definitely use in the future< /Review>

He was on time (early in fact), knowledgeable, stayed in touch with me via text throughout the process and was efficient.  I will also add that scheduling with velofix was a lot easier than any other mobile and in store services I contacted in San Francisco.  I was looking for a bike repair ASAP and while it was a week before I could get an appointment it still beat the 2+ weeks everywhere else.  I highly recommend velofix for convenient, mobile bike repair/service/assembly.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><UserId.>112947296098971490444< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Velofix did a great job tuning up my electric bike (Radrunner)! They were on time, knowledgeable, and friendly. Plus the convenience of their mobile truck coming to you can't be beat.</text>

<Text>I have used Velofix Bay Area for the past year to care for my stable of bikes. Had them deliver and build my Canyon, replace a broken wheel and tune up my ride. They are always on time, perform the service you ask them for and have always gone above and beyond to make sure my bike is ready to roll. Would highly recommend their service for anyone looking for a convenient way to get your bike fixed.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1596152612646, 'text': "Hi Jeff - Thanks so much for the glowing review of your recent service with our Velofix Bay Area team.

We ordered Priority eBikes online.  Velofix contacted us, asked us all the appropriate questions, came to our home to assemble the bikes, made sure we knew how to use every feature, and promised to be on-call should we have any questions.  Great communication.  Job superbly done.  Thanks!< /review>

Doug communicated clearly during the scheduling and he even arrived early for the appointment.  Given the current situation, Doug stayed a safe distance, fully masked up.  After a brief discussion he rolled the bike out of the carport to his mobile workshop.  After the work was done he reviewed the work with me and took payment.  As easy as it gets and would highly recommend Velofix to others.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1598368048330, 'text': 'Thanks Adam'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x808597103bf3af07:0x66011e100073a3bc< /gmap_id></record>

Great service. Nik was able to help with my Peloton bike and fix a pedal I could not remove and had been trying hard for about 3 weeks to figure out myself. Great service on a road bike tune up. Fast, patient and easy to text/communicate with safe COVID protocols.<//review>

have used Velofix twice.  Both times Mike was super competent but also seemed a bit too hurried.  Second time he left without derailleur properly adjusted.  But co-owner Nik returned with follow up visit within two days and got everything perfect.  Will use them again,  Booking and billing very seamless.</Text>

Great experience with the Velofix team. Nik was very communicative, helpful and was right on time for my appointment. He followed great PPE usage and kept it all quick, efficient, friendly and safe. Nik even helped install a new pedal arm for me and make my e-bike faster than ever with a look at the settings. Great experience from start to finish.< /Review>

I discovered velofix while on a recent shelter in place walk and snapped a pic of the van.  When I got home I went to their site to schedule a repair.  The site, service, and experience was top notch.  Easy, convenient, fast, and high quality.  NiK couldn't have been more helpful and he's a super cool guy.  He had to come back to my place three times to get the right parts for my hydraulic brakes.  He ordered some difficult to find tires.  He also replaced broken brake components with some spares he had at no cost.  Few companies check all the boxes for a customer experience and even fewer have this level of customer service all within a very reasonable and competitive price point.  Bravo!  Well done!  Thank you.  NiK, I still owe you a loaf of Pagnotta (Italian country sourdough).<//review>

< Review>
Nick was great! He initially delivered and installed my bike in 2018 - it was great to see that Velofix is not a model with quick turnover yet one that allows customers to work with the same mechanics over and over again. Nick went above and beyond the simple tune up, helped me out with break fluid and installation of a cockpit mounted garmin mount I did not have screws for. 5 stars !!!< /Review>

I am a repeat customer of Velofix, and for good reason. Nik, whom I've worked with before, is an excellent mechanic, perfectionist about his craft and all around good dude. He spent extra time at the end of his day getting my bike really dialed in, it now rides better than it ever has. Thanks Nik & Velofix!<//Review>

Super friendly staff and excellent service at the best convenience and price!

I am a repeat customer of Velofix, and for good reason. Nik, whom I've worked with before, is an excellent mechanic, perfectionist about his craft and all around good dude. He spent extra time at the end of his day getting my bike really dialed in, it now rides better than it ever has. Thanks Nik & Velofix!< /review>

<text>I did not have an appointment but just drove in as I saw the business from the street and figured i would take a chance.  It was a Saturday afternoon around 2 PM.  It was my lucky day.  They had just finished with a customer and had an open slot.  John was very professional and I was able to use the coupon offered.  Very good will go back to this place again.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Super friendly! Was honest with us before we did our smog test that it wasn’t going to pass, so we didn’t have to pay twice. Helped us find someone that could fix the issue and then finally did the smog test when we knew it would! Highly recommend good and honest prices.< /review>

<gmap_id>0x80dbf4a28f5416cf:0x2a919fa55b1c6657<//gmap_id><Text>This is my fourth Smog Certificate from John.  He is competitively priced, considerate and thorough.  They keep things strictly legal, while doing their best to guide a customer through to legitimately passing a Smog test.  When I failed a Smog test, he offered to check with his OBD sensor to avoid another failed test service charge. If you know you are going to fail but need to know why, it is better to let John know you will be needing two tests.  The first to get the list of items that you will take to your mechanic to repair so your mechanic doesn't have to charge you for their full diagnostic that may be thorough, but not a necessary list to passing your car's Smog test, and the second that will pass once those repairs are completed.  The Smog test process can be frustrating and expensive but having someone like John that is fair and considerate gets you through it with as little running around in circles spending money on mechanics and tests as possible.</Text>< user_id>

<text>Customer service went well until it came to payment. I politely asked the technician if they were still honoring their $29.99 coupon price as posted on their website. He said yes, but his partner seemed a little upset that I did not “print” out the coupon and did a small rant about how they were losing money.

Let’s be honest, it’s just a piece of paper. The majority of customers will see $29.99 as their advertising. In fact the “real” price, $60, isn’t posted anywhere on the website.

As a business they’re completely free to change their  price upfront, but never hassle a customer about your business operation finances. Price wasn’t even a consideration in my visit, service quality was. I was honestly asking for what price I was supposed to pay.

This is unacceptable behavior considering that other customer reviews did the exact same thing, the only difference was the car we drove. The car someone drives should not be a factor in customer treatment, regardless of how rare or common it is.

Update 1/17/2020 I’m not accusing this place. But I recently noticed unusual bank activity. Seeing that this is the only place in the last month I’ve used my bank card (they take the card to copy down information instead of swiping), I’d advise everyone to monitor their accounts. For Waba restaurants, Starbucks and Lyft.< /text>< user_id>

Excellent service.  Upfront on cost.  My regular place was closed for lunch so as I was driving around, I saw this place and pulled in.  The staff were friendly and helped take my car right away.  I was very satisfied with the service and even brought a second vehicle back the following week.<//Text>

Fast service! They took my car right away & had me all fixed up with the smog test I needed for my DMV registration. They even send the report for you. So easy & reasonably priced. If you need anything else for your car, John knows where to send you. He is very helpful & goes out of his way to make sure you get the service you need. Thanks, John, we'll be back.</review>

Received a letter from DMV that my renewal was incomplete and needed a smog check. I was rushing to find a good smog place with affordable prices. I came across this place and was assisted by John. He was very friendly and was able to accommodate me right away. Car service and customer service was great! Will be back again< /Review>

This place is great! I called ahead to see if an appointment was needed and the shop let me know they were free. Once I got there John was able to help me right away. This is my second time bringing my car in and I highly recommend it! Everyone was very professional and I was out of there in less than 15 minutes!</Text>

Best place to get a smog check. There is a gas station near by so you can get food and drinks while you wait but you barely have to wait. Extremely fast and helpful. Thank you!< /text>

Jon was the best!!!! He was so nice, even when an angry german lady was telling at him for 15 minutes. I'm telling you the man did not break, it was smiling all the way! I have to respect someone who can bring that much joy during such an annoying transaction. They were just the greatest and smog checked my car perfectly in record time! Thank you guys!!!<//Review>

<Text>I have a 93 F350, I had been trying to find a shop to get my smog done for the past week, 5 different shops told me their machines "were broken", and another told me they were booked up and to call back later.  I gave Smog Check Escondido a call and he told me he could get me in right away!  I was in and out with my smog cert really quick, very friendly and professional, and they gave me a discount.  I will defiantly be a return customer.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dbf4a28f5416cf:0x2a919fa55b1c6657<//gmapID></record>

FAST, GREAT PRICE, & CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called ahead to make sure they allowed walk-ins, and the minute I showed up they got my car in for smog—took less than 5 minutes! Everyone was extremely kind & they immediately gave me somewhere to sit where I could watch them do their work—they do honest, quick work. The gentleman commented on the cleanliness of my interior and was talking me through the process. They finished in about 5-10 minutes, it only cost, about $20.00-$25.00 with their online coupon, AND they asked to spray disinfect my car for me when they finished. Great COVID precautions, and overall a great business. I would definitely make the 45 minute drive again, JUST to smog my car with them!< /review>

Quick, professional, and courteous. No waiting, even without an appointment. They took good care of my car, and the price was very competitive with the coupon. Just pulled over, and they completed all the checks while we chatted a bit. This was my first visit, and I think I will be coming back.< /review>

@Jake Paul, I am sorry I believe you got the wrong Smog Station. These guys were amazing for my first time experience. You may have mistaken them for another Smog Station since there are so many nearby. Kindly suggest to give them a fair rating.< /review>< UserId.>

I went here to get my smog test and it was fast and both gentlemen were very nice, polite and helped me out tremendously.   They did the smog test and it was faster than i thought as i stood right next to the car. It took like 10 to 15 min.  Great Service, awesome customer service.. will definitely be going back again.<//Review>

I have taken 3 cars to be smog checked to this business.  Service is very fast, professional and friendly. I have never had to wait to be served. There is plenty of parking and it is easy to locate. Prices vary depending on the year and type of vehicle but they are very reasonable and have saved me money. I highly recommend Smog Check Escondido.<//Review>

<Review>Came in for a smog check, service was fast and the people working in there were very kind and polite. They asked us if we have a coupon which we don’t and told them it was our first time to visit them and just like that; they gave us a $20 coupon. They were particularly attentive to detail too that they pointed out that we needed to have our van serviced due to an airbag recall. I recommend this business for any of your smog check needs.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Everything was done very professionally. Both men were very friendly and were getting customers done in and out like second hand nature. Always seem to get great service from here. Definitely recommend stopping here first if you’re looking to get a smog check!< /Text>

<Text>The discount they offered here was tried and true.  Friendly and super fast.  I was there probably no more then 10 mins, honestly it was like 6 mins.

As soon as I pulled in, they were working on my car. Did I mentioned, this is the lowest price I've ever paid for a smog check!  Great job Smog Check Escondido!

< Review>
John and Les were fantastic. Funny and very polite. I took my truck to A Smog checker down the street I had gone to for years and they didnt even waste any time "NOT" caring for me. And I went there for years.
I then went to John and Les and they took me in "NO QUESTIONS ASKED"! Very polite, Professional, even had a conversation with me, and treated me like family. Got my truck done in no time. You will have my business from now on and I will refer you out  to friends and family :)
Thank you John and Les for helping with my Smog Check
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED....< /Review>

They were very helpful with explaining what I needed to do before a smog check. They were respectful, kind, and very knowledgable. I always go to this place even if there are a couple cars ahead of me because they are fast, diligent, and persistent. I highly recommend going here for a smog check! They are simply the best!< /Review>

Very quick Service. Very happy. I hope people understand there are extra charges regarding types of vehicles brought in. I brought in an SUV and it increased the price... Everything was perfect. I will go back again.</text>

Today I realized that I was running out of time to get a RV smog check done. At the last minute I called and was a able to speak to John and he made an adjustment in his schedule to fit us in. I arrived and was greeted by John and his smog tech, we were in and out in no time. These guys are very professional and priced very fair.  Thank you John for your help today.<//Text>

This is my second year in a row coming to this location. Each time I've been able to roll right in with no wait, and no fuss. The staff are courteous and efficient, and always willing to work with you. Hands down the easiest, most convenient  bussiness I have gone to for smog in my 6 years of SoCal living.< /Review>

They got me in and smogged quickly, it failed at first and after I fixed it they gave me a huge discount and it passed. Very helpful and understanding professionals!<//Review>

<text>Showed up without an appointment for a smog check.  They treated me cordially and were able to accommodate me very quickly.  They even had a mechanic friend from the shop next door take the time to install my rear window wipers.  Excellent service.  I will definitely recommend them and use them again.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I was so impressed by the amazing customer service. I called and was able to get an appointment the same day. John, the owner, was very friendly and made sure to make me feel at home. I had my appointment at 1PM and was out of there by 1:15PM. I will be going back in the future and recommending it to my family and friends.<//text>

Smog Check Escondido worked fast with multiple cars and even moved me up when another car was taking too long to run the check. Highly recommend if you want fast service. Also don't forget to get their coupon off their website.< /text>

<Review>They really took care of me down here at smog check, Escondido. The owner is super friendly and get you in and out really fast. I would highly recommend this as your go to smog check spot. Keep in mind that if you use the Groupon that there is an extra $10 charge on top Of what the website charges you. All in all I had a great experience will definitely take the rest of my cars.<//Review>< Pics>

I googled places to get a smog check and happened to come across this place (the 4.8 rating got my attention right away). The owner was so sweet and very personable. The smog check took no longer than 10 minutes. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends/family and will be back once I need to get another smog check. Highly recommend!!<//review>

Zero waiting time, the mechanic met me at the door, asked how he could help, explained to me the process and the wait time was less than 15 minutes. I wish all businesses were this tentative and painless. Appreciate it Smog Check Escondido!<//text>

I went here after the DMV told me I had to get a completely unnecessary smog certificate for a brand new vehicle. They didn’t have any garage bays available and were working on an RV that was taking a long time to complete so they had me pull up along side and they pulled the tools outside the garage to do the test on my car. I was in and out within 20 minutes with all paperwork in hand. The mechanics were all friendly and observed proper COVID protocol. I was very happy with the service and would go back if the need arises.< /Review>

<Review>These guys are seriously the best! Not only was the smog check super quick, but they also offered to give me a coupon to save $20! And they found an oil cap under my hood that had been missing for months. I highly recommend going to them!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

It’s a great place to get a smog certificate. The owner and an employee are so kind. I brought my vehicle for smog test. It’s ready in 15min. I’m very pleased to see this kind of smog station. 👍 5 star.</Text>

Never Go To This Station SUCK Service !!!!! :(  Horrible & negative customer service. I wouldn't recommend especially since there are so many other Smog stations available in the area. Customer service means providing assistance, not inflicting personal judgment nor opinions. Rude entitled acts won't go far in the world of business.<//review>

They were very quick to serve, no hiccups, I didn't even know what I was doing but they were able to help me out pretty easy, and they're definitely cheaper than the rest of the smog places, 10/10 would recommend, GG< /Review>

This is the second time I used this Smog Check service, and both times I got a good deal and was in/out quickly.

The owner is friendly and loves to talk, which help the time go by even quicker.

We’ll continue to use this shop in the future.<//text>

Showed up mid-morning on Christmas Eve and not only were they open, they were happy to see me. John, the owner, greeted me when I stepped out of my car and was really nice. I found an online coupon, but couldn't print ot out due to technical issues on my end. I asked if I could use a screen-shot of the coupon and he gladly took it. Its a small shop, but they were fast, efficient, and very friendly. I will definitely come back any time I need a smog.< /text>

They don't deserve even one star. I drove 10 miles to their location with a Groupon for the smog service. They refused to honor the coupon. They are frauds, liars, and cheats. DO NOT USE THEIR BUSINESS FOR ANYTHING. If you do, you will be very sorry.<//Review>

Extremely friendly and professional owner and staff.  Clean shop!  I brought a Groupon to use but the owner explained that he cancelled future Groupons because of customers not reading the fine print and being nasty to him about the standard DMV charge adders.  I was nice and told him I totally understand.  He said he would honor the Groupon price because I was understanding.  Bottom line: be nice and he'll take care of you.< /text>

They are very friendly and give you a great price. My smog test failed at first but they did not charge me the second time, just the certificate fee. Highly recommend the shop.< /Review>

I have a 2015 Nissan Sentra. Assumed they would charge me the going rate, which is $30 or $40 - they charged me $60. I guess since I had out of state plates, they assumed I wouldn't know what the price is supposed to be.<//review>

<text>John from Smog Check Esco was great! They had canceled their account with Groupon due to Groupon not providing enough info to customers and causing confusion on pricing. I was never notified from Groupon. John apologized, explained the issues, and offered me a discount to best accommodate me. I appreciate that! Definitely recommend<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Terrible. Bought a Groupon and they refused to honor it. I showed him that the Groupon had not expired and he still would not do the smog. Not my fault their machine broke. Will never get service here or with Groupon ever again.</Review>

<text>While I was impressed with how nice these guys were, how efficient they were, and how quick they were to help me, I was frustrated with how they kept raising my price after I submitted my coupon. It was advertised as $30 and they made me spend $50 in loopholes.<//text>< Pictures>

Super fast service, I called needing it last minute on a Saturday and this man was kind, gave my daughter and I water while we waited, and just made the whole experience of getting a smog positive.  Definitely recommend the place.< /Review>

I bought a Groupon for Smog Check Escondido to get my smog check done. The gentlemen were very friendly, courteous (held my drink while I got out of the car), and quick. My Groupon was accepted without an issue. We joked around while I waited for them to complete the check. I would definitely recommend this business for your smog check needs!< /Text>

<Text>The owner was extremely friendly. There was a Jeep ahead of me and he said it would only be a few minutes.  I sat and waited for my Dodge Journey to be smogged.  As I waited,  he asked me if I would like some water.  I had a coupon that was good for a regular vehicle to be smogged.  Because my car was an SUV, he had to charge more.  However, he decided he wouldn't charge me the extra fee.  The service was great and you can't beat the price (even if you don't have a coupon).<//Text>< Date>

Awesome and quick service! The guys are super friendly, funny and even repaired my busted side view mirror while they did the smog test. Great service and will definitely be back here next time I need anything done with my car or engine!<//Review>

Great service, was in and out in 15-20 minutes. Staff was friendly and professional. Groupon discount made it best price in town. Groupon explains explicit that SUV’s, Truck’s are extra and Groupon is for vehicles 2000 or newer. Still best price with great service.</review>

<pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><review>(Translated by Google) The service is fast. The bad thing is that your coupons are pure hook. I arrived with a discount coupon to the establishment and before I asked something they had already connected my car to their machines. Now when I ask about the promotion. The owner left me with an account that sums the same that they charge, there was nothing discount

El servicio es rapido. Lo malo es que sus cupones son puro gancho. Llegue con un cupon de descuento al establecimiento y antes que preguntara algo ya  habian conectado mi carro a sus maquinas.
