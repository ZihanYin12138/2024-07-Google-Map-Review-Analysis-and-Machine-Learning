Came here with my daughter for the first time today to support a BHS IMA fundraiser. This place is the cutest, and everything we ordered was delicious!

I got a Lavender Earl Gray Latte and the flavors were soft and wonderful. Not too sweet either! My daughter got a Strawberry Mango Smoothie which was also delicious and not too sweet. I definitely want to try their Banana Chocolate Latte next time.

The pastries were on point, and I wish I got some extras for breakfast in the morning. They were that good!

The service was super friendly. There were only two people working, and they were very sweet and kept the line moving well.

Because of this fundraiser, we are now fans for life!<//Text>

Ugly Mug is our go-to! My kids absolutely love their specialty hot chocolates and I've never been disappointed in a new drink. I love the owners and the community they've created there. If you're in Burbank, you MUST hit the Ugly Mug.</text>

Cute little coffee spot. The vibe is very homey and the staff is incredible. They always so cheerful and sweet. They always have great music on so that’s a big plus.

We go in a lot as my boyfriend is obsessed with the blueberry iced coffee. He says that it’s the perfect, subtle blend of blueberries and coffee.< /Review>

Parking is a big problem. Almost convinced me to Not go to this location. Customer service was marginally acceptable. Cashier was neither friendly nor happy to be there it seemed. Drinks were very good! Lost 2 stars for the parking hardship and the mediocre atmosphere the staff provided.</text>

<response>{'time': 1614385300022, 'text': 'Hello Jessica, thank you for visiting us and recommend us however after reading your review, it seemed that it the review provided about the timing was not accurate and falsely stated. We took the time to review our sales and video and there wasn’t a moment where any of our customers waited more then 10 mins, in fact all of our sales were made within 3 minutes apart. Everything we ask for was very consistent. As a small business we try and work very hard every day to provide quality customer service and quality drinks. Starbucks is considered more of a fast food coffee and much more waiting time to orders & receive drinks. It’s just a preference if you like that type of service and environment. A review as such can hurt many small businesses. We hope that you can respectfully remove it. Thank you'}<//response><Name>Jessica Stobart</Name>< gmap_id>

So I stumbled upon this amazing little coffee shop and I have to say they do a great job of delivering. They have these unicorn hot chocolate drinks...well...I know it's silly, but it was really good and the fact that it is so silly, colorful,and doused in sprinkles just made the experience all the better.  The staff have also been incredibly friendly each time I've gone in<//Text>

<Review>The only issue I could even possibly have is that sometimes the line is long, but what's a five to seven minute wait for some of the best coffee in Burbank?

This place is awesome. Small, but not tiny, charming, and the staff is super friendly. The coffee is tasty, hot and fresh.

I recommend this place highly.<//Review>< user>

Driving by I caught The Ugly Mug out of the corner of my eye and stopped to check it out. It’s super cute! Great, warm ambiance! Indoor and outdoor seating. The staff was very nice. My Frappuccino was tasty and I had a swell time. They offer baked goods as well, but I didn’t partake. I’ll definitely be back here regularly! Check them out!<//Review>

I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at The Ugly Mug on our interview date.

We have a special place in our hearts for Burbank and we are happy to finally list The Ugly Mug as one of our long list of reasons why we will come back to the city again and again. This family-owned shop takes you to the past once you step inside with its adorably vintage décor (comprised of old-time-y artwork, clocks, cameras, and coffee pots) and traditional fifties interior layout and design, complete with rustic hardwood accents and a warm and inviting color palette. Apart from its physical appearance, the shop’s menu is absolutely something to praise as they’ve found a harmonious balance between classic recipes and potential new favorites. On the food side, you’ve got a variety of fresh-baked pastries of the croissant, muffin or bagel form with options ranging from sweet to savory to fruity. On the beverage side,  lattes, iced coffees and espressos are the scene stealers with plenty of flavor options to choose from, in which I gluttonously opted for a Blueberry Lavender Iced Coffee for our visit. Don’t drink coffee? No problem! There are plenty of equally delicious tea and non-caffeinated beverages to choose from, including fruit-infused smoothies and hot chocolate.

For the past two decades, the Ugly Mug owners have strived to create a welcoming community for coffee (or tea, smoothie, or non-caffeinated beverage) lovers from all walks of life, and it’s always impressive and exciting to hear about a local mom and pop shop staying alive in an era of instant gratification in shop form (think Starbucks or Coffee Bean) or delivery form (i.e. subscriptions, pickup services, etc.). In a way, it shows that there are still many of us who crave a homecooked (or in this case, homebrewed) experience when it comes to the types of businesses we step foot in, which is something that has slowly been returning as a trend in the modern age. Hats off to The Ugly Mug and cheers to many more years of caffeine fueled memories!<//Text>

The Service: The owners, Steve & Emily (husband/wife team)~ Full of passion for their new business! Both of them are so friendly with customers, very welcoming. Their staffs are very attentive, always keeping the store clean. I love supporting local business owners especially young entrepreneurs!

The Drinks: Tried out their specialty Drink "Unicorn". Super colorful presentation~ What a fun drink!! You can order either hot, iced or blended. Perfect drink for summer time!

Love their outdoor patio seating area! I heard their tea is very good, will definitely go back & try it soon.

The Parking: Street parking (free!)<//review>

My favorite coffee shop in Burbank. Very pet friendly! Bring your pet, and they will be greeted with a smile. Cozy atmosphere with outside tables and chairs.</Text>

<Text>This coffee shop would be right at home in a small town...and I mean that in the best possible way. The interior is full of warm wood and decor that makes it feel like you are stepping into someone's home. The Kona coffee is delicious, the croissants are crispy and butter, and the staff is charming and friendly.

This is a hidden gem that I selfishly wish would stay hidden (but hope that others visit because it is worth the trip!)</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>So glad this place finally opened. There has been no coffee options for awhile in this section of Burbank. The latte was very good and so was the plain coffee. They have a list of brews for regular, decaf, flavored both hot and iced. Look forward to coming back. The nutty doodle blend was very good.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

If you're from Seattle and looking for a good coffee shop, this is it. The baristas don't burn the shots. Lots of flavors. And unique hot chocolates with flair and fun.< /text>

I really like their coffee. The kona is tasty. Also tried the earl gray lavender latte, a little weak but interesting and good flavors. The muffin was overpriced and just okay, not as impressed. I'll keep coming back for the delicious coffee, and amazing amibiance and music. <3</review>

Lovely little coffee shop run by wonderful people. Go for great service, and a decent, but lovingly crafted coffee drink. The pastries are also delicious without being bougie. I would recommend this place for a nice mid afternoon chat 😁<//text>

Businesses on Burbank seem to fail so often.  This shop is a welcome change and I hope it sticks around.  The coffee is well made and delicious.  The service is always kind.  I'll do my small part and keep going here since it's within walking distance from my house.</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>The coffee here is not all that, the place seems a little lonely , the kids that work there are probably the only good thing at that shop. But I just found out the owners (steve n emely) dont give the tips we put either in the jar or in credit card to their employees, actually the owners keep the tips to themselves and dont give any to their employees, to me they are taking advantage of those young kids. Thats just very sad! I Will never go to this coffee shop ever again. And if your thinking of applying to work here think twice!!<//Text>< pictures>

Whenever I need keys (home and car), I always turn to Pomona Locksmith. I've had house keys copied and car keys copied/programed. Chuck always does an awesome job.< /review>

<text>The shop is a little booth in the parking lot surrounded by other businesses, but Chuck, who is the owner, is very pleasant to work worth. I needed a couple of motorcycle keys made, and he had them done in no time.
I would definitely recommend having all your keys made here.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
I usually come here to get my keys copied. Service is fast and convenient. This time I went to see if he can get my file cabinet safe to open. Unfortunately, I bought the cabinet for a really good deal, but didn't have the combination code to open it. Chuck was able to refer me to his friend Jerry and he ended up figuring out the code within 45mins without damaging it and for a good price! Came out a happy camper! Thank you. Definitely  recommend this place.</Review>

Chuck was very professional and honest. He programmed my key fobs for my truck. I chatted with him while he was programming them. He is one of the most stand up guys I ever met. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great locksmith.</text>

I had a great experience today. Had to wait a little bit but they made me a beautiful key for my car with no appointment, and were the most reasonably priced around. All employees were kind and polite and a pleasure to deal with and offered me water and a chair. I am impressed!!<//Review>

Chuck was incredible. Came in clutch for me! I called him and he stayed open extra late for me, only to give me a free key because he wasn't 100% it would work. The key ended up working great! Really glad to have Chuck and his business around. Couldn't recommend him more.</review>

Great service  and keys are always made perfect  ! I have keys made at other places and I've had to go back because they were cut wrong so this is the only place I truly trust ! Even keys made for older cars like a Karmann ghia.  Perfect  !  Don't let the little Shack fool you in the middle of the Parking lot they are experts at what they do !<//text>

<review>I feel confident and comfortable every tome we go. The owners do a great job keeping the place clean and sanitized. They follow all rules and regulations, which is great during these covid times. Great place for the little ones. I took my little ones there many times and were always happy. Very clean and fun place. Highly recommend.</review>< Pictures>

Just had a wonderful experience at under the sea with my grandchildren and my family. The place felt very safe to all of us. Mask wearing, sanitizing, and social distancing . And, the kids had a great time! I'll definitely be back. Thank you again.<//Review>

These guys really offer the best playroom for my kids and even great indoor activities for them. My kids really had a great time with them, and I'm thankful because they were able to take care of them beautifully. This place is certainly the best for parents and their children. Very worth it services! Highly recommended!</text>

{'time': 1619821391066, 'text': 'It is very unfair to judge a business without knowing anything about our operations procedure.  Under The Sea did not do anything illegal. The health and safety of our customers is our number one priority. Our facility was  permitted to operate with very limited capacity, social distancing, and all of the requirements of the CDC and the Los Angeles health department. The health department gave us a permit to work as a camp and do small gatherings of families under 10 people. We were operating legally and unfortunately Judge Judy’s show cut that part out, even though her producer brought her the documents from the LA Health Department.\nWe have nothing to be ashamed of. The lady (customer) had a small birthday party for her child, just family, and at the end of the party skipped out on paying her bill. She said she forgot her money and was going to come right back to pay the balance. She never came back and took advantage of a business. In these very difficult times when businesses have it extremely hard to survive.\nWe really hope you will reconsider and remove your 1 star review, because it hurts the business reputation, especially when all facts are unknown.\nPlease stay safe and healthy.\nUnder The Sea management.'}</response>

<text>Watch out!!!!  Operates parties for children during covid.  Watch judge Judy April 30
Episode. It says in their disclaimer from management that thy were operating in smaller groups of 10 people.  Although she had 19 people there. This is the mindset. Lol</text>< Pictures>

<Review>on the negative reviews stating you were operating illegally, you keep telling people that you were in fact operating legally. however, the owners paperwork and statement at the end of judge judy’s episode tells a different story. so not only were you operating illegally, you lied to a judge, and you are also lying about the safety and conditions to your customers. you admitted conducting illegal business. stop backtracking. shame<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFx-6Mlh2pIccAhkdWgpjBwxAeAgPE3cel5Rh9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>{'time': 1619882781587, 'text': 'We did not lie to the judge and paper work was legal and issued by the city.

What a wonderful place! What an amazing place for children! We took our 3-year-old and 18-month-old boys and they didn't want to leave. There is so much to see and do. Everything is so interactive and safe. The staff members were so friendly. They also have plenty of learning games and toys. Highly recommended for anyone with children under 8-year-old.<//text>

<text>My kids love this place. Have been going there for years and celebrated many birthday parties there. They recently added new equipment and the kids absolutely love it. Love that they offer private parties and we are allowed to bring our own food if we want. Highly recommend this Playground (:<//text>< response>

It was yesterday when I brought my 2 kids into this playroom, and I'm impressed because the staff accommodated us cordially. It was them that managed to provide my kids with some fun and even some basic learnings. I like to commend these guys because the facilities are well-maintained, and everything else that is needed for my children was provided right on. Indeed, the best place for kids! Very worth it!</text>

I honestly enjoy bringing my kids to play to such a nice playground. I’m a stay at home dad and I bring my kids here once every week. I buy a membership, which makes it even more affordable. There’s enough activities to keep the kids busy for hours, and when we come home they are ready to pass out😉. The place is always clean and the staff is friendly. We also had a birthday party there last year, and I’m pretty sure we will do it again this year, as all the kids and adults really enjoyed it. Thank you Sandy for always taking your time to chat with me and laugh at my silly stories ((:< /text>

For me, this is a good place for young kids to play. It is not that so big but my kids really had fun with this place. Ideal not just for kids but for parents bonding too. This is the nicest indoor children's playground in town. Such a very fun place to bring your kids. I highly recommend this place to all parents.<//review>

This is the best playground for kids! It keeps them busy for hours and hours, and they never get bored. There’s no time limit like other places, you pay for the entrance and you’re allowed to stay as long as you like. Very nice place and very friendly people.<//Review>

With flight prices so low my girlfriend and I took a last minute get away a few days ago. We really enjoy under the sea because there’s so much there to do for little ones. My Gf has 2 very young cousin who we took here with us and they loved it!! Such clean indoor playground with a great staff. It's a really nice way to spend a weekend. We'll definitely be back again next time we're in town.</Review>

This is a beautiful playground. Our kids had a really good time playing there for hours. There are lots of different things for the kids to do. Mine especially love the little go around carousel and the fun house slide. We all got hungry at one point and ordered pizza from the lady at the counter. They also have drinks and snacks available for purchase. Very cute and colorful place and we will definitely be coming back soon.</review>

<text>Great place to take small kids. Our groups  flight out of LAX was at 8 pm and our group had to checkout of the hotel by noon so we went to this place. The small kids in our group loved it. Free wifi and tables in the back for other adults to use laptops. The place worked out good for last day in California by accommodating everyone in our group.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2ba68c4347dd7:0xd542065f609c9697<//gmap_id><date>1504132131538</date><rate>5</rate>< response>

<Text>This is a great little play area for kids. It's one big room and lots of fun. There are slides and climbing areas and little cars. There are two restrooms and a changing table. There are no drinking fountains so bring water with you. The employees were friendly and helpful. My kids enjoyed the party.<//Text>< Pics>

Under the Sea is one of my favorite places to take my girls!!! They absolutely love it!!! The more recent time I went, I was so happy and excited to see new additions to the place!! The staff is constantly rearranging the location of items to ensure that every place of the playground is being used to it's full potential! My oldest loves the mini track with the high speed car. (Although the length of the space the car runs is a little too small and kind of nerve wrecking it's pretty safe because they are padding). They recently added a nice spinning go round (similar to spinning tea cups). All the kids seemed to love that addition along with another similar item that children sit on whales I think and they can spin.. Not as fast but it's still a very fun play set.

The only thing I would change or like to be changed would be the space of the fast car track. It's very fun but it needs more space for the car to run so that children don't immediately crash on to the padding.
Not enough to lower the rating because I'm a parent who's close by supervising my girls.

This is definitely one of my favorite indoor playgrounds!!! Remember to take socks!!!9<//review>

Visited it for the first time but I felt the place needs makeover and little hygiene. It's big place but less things to play. Kitchen dint have utensils, cars were not clean, slides were dirty, shopping carts were there but no items to put in the cart. Toys and play area was sticky.< /Review>

First of all it is quite big and has a large separate eating area. There are many different slides, play houses, cars, soft cubes and 2 carousels. The party was very organized and everyone including the adults had fun. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The pirate character did an amazing job on face painting and entertaining the kids.

The playground is full of equipment to keep them entertained for quite a few hours. Everything is clean and organized and they have a really big eating area. They do require socks for everyone in the playground area so if you don’t have them you will need to purchase them at the front counter. We were allowed to bring our own snacks which is nice, but they also have snacks and drinks for sale. Very nice place for a play date or for a birthday party.< /Review>< Pictures>

Thanks to Sandy and her crew for organizing everything and making sure everything went perfectly. The 2 hours went by so fast and before we knew it we had to leave.

Very nice playground! I’ve been to many others and this one by far is the nicest. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. They offer playtime M-F with late hours on Tuesdays, for those of us who work it’s very convenient. Saturday and Sunday they only do private parties. Their prices are very reasonable in comparison to other playgrounds, and I like that during the week there’s no time limit to play and you can bring your own snacks. You can actually leave to go to lunch and come back afterwards, as long as you let them know. I highly recommend this playground for either play time or birthday parties because they are great at both.<//review>

<response>{'time': 1564955961236, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review. We really appreciate your support.'}</response><Review>This is a nice place to bring the kids. We usually come on Tuesdays because they are open till 8 on that day and that’s really convenient for us. There is a lot of different things for the kids to play with. The place is always clean and the staff is really friendly. The playtime is unlimited as long as you don’t stay past the closing time. We usually order pizza and some wings from them and that’s something we always look forward to😊
I highly recommend this very cute playground!< /Review></record>

<text>I took my nephew to play at under the sea and we both had a good time. Such a fun place with lots of toys to play with. My nephew especially liked all the slides, and just kept going back and forth. The lady at the front was very helpful and we ended up ordering pizza and juice from her. Time went by so fast and before you know it it was 3 hours later and we needed to leave. I recommend this place because it’s a lot of fun, it’s clean and it’s safe for the children.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

<Text>Fun playground to take your little ones. I like the fact that we can bring our own snacks, since my child has many food allergies. We come here at least once a week and we also do a lot of play dates here as well. We have been to many different indoor playgrounds and this one by far is our favorite. Clean and safe!<//Text>< Pictures>

My sister and I took our kids here today for a play date for the first time. The kids had a really good time and made many new friends. This is a very cute place filled with all kinds of play equipment. There are a few slides, 2 carousels, lots of different cars and a bunch of soft shaped blocks for stacking and climbing. The place is really colorful and everything is in the theme of under the sea. The playground and the toys were clean and the worker kept sweeping and wiping down the tables every so often. Our kids had a really good time and were busy playing making it quite easy on us. We brought some snacks with us, but realizes later that we could order pizza from the lady upfront so about 2 hours into playing we ordered a pizza and bought some additional snacks and drinks. I definitely recommend this playground especially in the summer time when you want to stay away from the heat and enjoy the playground in a nice cool atmosphere.</Review>

Lots of fun things for the kids to do. Almost copyright infringement of Disney characters. They also try to get you (through your kids) to buy other things like cheap knick knacks and toys in vending machines. No drinking fountain. Bring water.< /text>

We are visiting from out of town and were recommended to come here with our kids by our friends who are regular customers of this playground. I was very impressed by the place and how much fun my kids had. It was a little busy probably due to the rain, but still was very nice. We ordered pizza from them and bought some drinks and snacks. Overall we were there for about 4 hours but the time went by so fast as the kids were having a really good time and were making new friends. I bought some coffee from the nice lady in the front and we had a nice chat, even got her to recommend some fun places to visit while in the area for a few days. I wish we had an indoor playground like this back home where I’m from. Great place! Highly recommend! Will definitely come here again if we come to visit LA in the near future.<//review>

We love this place! Big play area and a big eating area.  They do have some rules to follow like you can’t bring in outside pizza or cake, but they allow different snacks to be brought in and they have pizza for sale. And don’t forget socks otherwise you will need to purchase from them.</text>

< review>
We had our sons birthday party there last week and wanted to share what a pleasant experience we had.  The place is beautiful with a lot of different toys to keep the kids occupied for hours. The staff was very helpful with everything including setting up and even packing all our leftovers to take home. Customer service is definitely top notch! We had requested a pirate character which did an amazing job at entertaining the kids and doing face painting. Pizza, juice and cake for the kids was provided by the playground. My wife and I didn’t want to fuss with bringing food for the adults so we ordered a bunch of pizzas and drinks from them and all we ended up doing is bringing a fruit salad. This was a great party and very easy and enjoyable for us parents. Thank you to Under The Sea for doing a great job and I’m sure we will do our next birthday party there as well.< /review>

We enjoy bringing our kids to under the sea. It’s always nice and clean and the staff is very friendly. There’s a lot of different stuff in the play area to keep the kids busy for many hours. Our kids are all different age and they all love playing there, especially climbing through the structure and down the slides.<//Text>

<Text>One of the best kids place you can take your little ones to. They had so much fun there. The place has room for infants to even my 8 year old enjoying it soooo much. We will definitely come back here if we are in the area again. You can bring in your own food and drinks while you're there which is a major plus! No pizza though because they are already selling pizza there.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We love this place. We are regular customers and had couple of birthdays celebration over there. We can't complain but recently we witnessed an incidence that wasn't appealing. Some kids were fighting over a ball, 2-3 kids cornered a child who was holding a ball, and they were not letting him move. The child tried to escape, couldn't so he pushed one of the boys (which is wrong). The absurd part was the owner who went and grabbed that child and started yelling at him (after the other 2 boys went and told their parents,  yet the parents didn't see what happened nor the owner). My issue is not the incidence, these things happen between kids and we teach them how to defend themselves without  hurting others but the owner's reaction was completely unacceptable. It's the parents job to discipline their kids. She yelled at the child, grabbed him from his arms and didn't give that child a chance to talk. The child admitted that he pushed the boy , was defending himsel, when another wonderful parent was patient enough to know how to solve the conflict.

This woman's attitude is the reason i m giving the place a 2 stars. 1 for her lack of skills and proper communication matters. Another star for giving her the benefit of the doubt  She is rude and mean and crossed her boundaries.<//Text>

{'time': 1601418367598, 'text': "Dear Rachel,\nI'm sorry you feel this way, even though your child had a very good time playing at out playground for over 2 hours. During these very difficult times it's hard enough for a business to survive without having someone write a negative review to try to make things even worse instead of addressing the issue at the time. Our number one priority is to keep our customers safe and happy in a clean and sanitized playground, following all cdc and health department guidelines.\nFirst, our playground is over 5000 sq feet and the parent you're referring to was not wearing a mask\nbecause he was in the eating area away from anyone, eating his chips. The only time we allow anyone to remove their mask\nis while eating. Second, his little boy has a medical condition that allows him not to wear a mask, we as owners are aware of this because he is our regular customer and has a note from his Dr. And lastly, our employees Always wear a mask, and the only reason the employee removed her mask (sitting over 40 feet away from all customers) was because she was eating her salad.\nOur employee witnessed the other parent asking you if his boy could play with your child, and instead of nicely rejecting you turned away and told your friend it was time to leave.  When you both left, you each took the time to give us a 1 Star review.\nAgain, things can always be handled in a nice manner by addressing issues at time of any incident instead of trying to harm a neighborhood business that has a hard time trying to survive during Covid19 restrictions.\nI would like to ask you and your friend to please remove this negative review, and I can assure you that we do require everyone in our facility to wear masks among other measures we are taking to keep everyone safe and healthy.\nThank you 🙏🏻"}< /Resp>

Under The Sea Indoor Playground has been a great place for toddlers and young kids to play and explore for the past 15+ years.  I had my daughter's 3rd birthday party at Under The Sea and it was a big hit with the little ones.  The staff was friendly, attentive, and organized.  The facility was clean, had a variety of interesting toys to play with and equipment to play on, and the staff did all the party preparation and clean up. Woo hoo!  The character that we had, a princess of course, was lovely and gave each child a bit of individual attention.  All around this was a memorable birthday party.  I would highly recommend Under The Sea to anyone who wants to hang out with their kids for a fun afternoon, a rainy day, or to enjoy an awesome party.</Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>This is a fun place to bring your kids. Lots of colorful toys for the kids to play with and different slides and carousels. I think the price is pretty reasonable since you’re allowed to stay as long as you want. We often do play dates with other kids and this is our favorite place to meet up. They have a late nite on Thursdays, so that’s a big plus for working moms like myself. We have also attended several birthday parties at this playground and had a very good time. The staff makes it fun for the kids and stress free for the parents. Sandy is so patient with all of us crazy moms and she’s always so accommodating. We love coming and making new friends. The only negative thing is that my kids never want to leave, lol.< /review><time>1555201898683< /time>< Response>

The woman who works the counter at the front is the absolute nicest person I have ever dealt with in my life. I’m reading some of these reviews and they are women that I have actually witnessed myself do nothing but break the rules at this establishment. The rules are there for our children safety. I don’t need my kids getting injured because you can’t handle your child. Don’t be mad at her because you were out on able to maintain good behavior and an establishment that’s intended for children<//Text>

Place was hard to find I passed by twice with cars behind trying to find it. You have to go through an alley.as for the toys and such my kids were entertained for 3 hours and still didn't want to leave.i have a 2 & 7 year old.my 7 year had a 1 year old grabbing her hand raking her places it was cute.she didn't want my 7 year old to leave.my 2 year old had a blast they both fell asleep on the half hour ride home.so you KNOW they had fun.i would recommend this place.<//review>

While the concept is a great one, I will say its expensive for a toddler. Some of the toys are missing bolts, are cracked or are sticky, like they haven't been wiped down in a long time! Place is sock only which is a great idea. Except who knows when the carpet got washed last, my daughter had new socks and they came out filthy!! Sad to say I dont think we'll be returning.</review>

Our indoor playground fee is $11 per child for the entire day, which is actually lower then most as we do not limit the amount of hours you stay and play. We would like to inform you that our facility gets cleaned and sanitized daily, unfortunately some kids do tend to sneak in food into the playground and may cause some of the toys to get kinda sticky. We do however wipe everything down at the end of each day. As far as your daughters socks getting dirty, we would like you to know that our carper and our entire facility floor gets cleaned regularly as cleanliness and safely is our number one priority. Your daughter, just like most of the other kids in the playground ran around the entire facility which includes the tiled eating area where a lot of the guests walk around in their shoes, hence your daughters socks getting soiled.\nWe hope you and your daughter enjoyed your time at Under The Sea, and we hope to see you again soon.'}< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

My daughter loves this place! I'm one of those parents that keeps an eye on their kids every second and I feel comfortable letting my daughter play here. The lady is usually aware of what's going on which is good. There's a little area for you to eat and I think some parents usually order pizza and have it delivered there. The only complaint I have is the parking. The spaces are very limited so it's best just to park on the street.</review>

Love this place! Great for a child's development and super fun.     its a nice place for kids to learn and play. They could have added painting or craft session as well.   Very friendly and warm staff. Every week the Gymboree is rearranged and focuses on different baby and child development aspects. The songs are fun and parents are encouraged to engaged with their child with many group activities and  songs. The place is always kept clean and the fees are reasonable. Most importantly my son loves it. SO DO WE !!!!<//Text>

My girls both really loved this place the entire time. Even after we left which wasn't easy. The lady worker was nice and courteous. She charged my phone for me while I played with my daughters. My girls are 23 months and 15 months old. They absolutely love to play so this place was paradise for them</Review>

<text>We had a party for our 3 year old a few weeks ago in February. We were originally planning to do it in our back yard but due to bad weather decided to do it at under the sea, where we have been to multiple parties previously.
We ended up with 60 guests, kids, and adults, and I have to say the staff handled it very well.
A big thank you to Sandy, Elana, and Nikki who made everything go so well. They sat up all our decorations, food, drinks, and a bunch of other stuff we brought with us. After the party finished the girls packed up all our stuff and even helped us put everything into our car.

I recommend this place because it’s a fun place for kids of different ages, the playground is really big, the staff is more than accommodating and my kid had an amazing birthday party.< /text>< pictures>

I was there today with my grandkids. The place is very nice and clean. There is different kinds of play equipment for kids of different ages. My grandkids had fun playing and it was actually hard for me to get them to leave. The lady at the front was really nice and helped me talk the kids into leaving by offering them a candy. Thankfully that worked! Will definitely come back again, but will bring my own candy to bribe the kids into leaving 🙂< /Review>

<review>Fun place for the kids. My daughter loves going here. You can bring in food to give the kids some fuel. They also sell some snack things.  You do have to wear socks but they do sell them there is you forget.   Most parents just sit on their phones or talk and let their kid run wild which is fine but I have seen a lot of kids hitting other kids and the parents are no where to be seen.</review>< pics>

<Review>My kids always have fun here because there is a lot to do. Buy it kind of looks like a little tykes factory exploded. Plastic toys everywhere. There is not a lot of attention to detail either. For example, It doesn't seem super clean, there is no food in the play kitchen. It is fine and we will go once in a while, but it is not my favorite!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Awesome place to host a child's birthday. We have a few different ages and they all enjoyed the gym. There is Amit of space for them to run and play. There is a separate area for the food and there is also 2 family restrooms that are kid friendly. Make sure your have your socks on or they will not allow you on the playground.  Nicely decorated with cartoon characters.
We were actually invited here for the birthday but we are definitely thinking about hosting our next celebration here. They have packages that include everything in them with the characters and the face paint. All you have to do is bring yourself. Haha
Parking was easy and was located in the back of the building where the entrance is<//text>

A good number of play structures in this indoor play ground. The paintings on the wall and the "prizes" that they give out as gifts are all pretty cheap. But it's fine for say a toddlers party.<//Review>

<Review>Its pretty good definitely fun for the kids and great for parties lets be honest when having bdays for kids its meant for them and this place is for them.

Our 3 year old daughter Giuliana has been going to this playground for a good 6 months and she's always had a good time. I have read a few of the reviews about the rude and horrible front desk woman and, unfortunately, we had our first encounter yesterday when se screamed at my daughter and the nanny and kicked them out of the playground for no reason at all! I never liked her but, being an ex-New Yorker, I can usually deal with attitude and rudeness. Yesterday however, was a different story bordering discrimination and abuse. I sincerely cannot understand how management hasn't gotten rid of this woman a long time ago! She's a liability which is clearly hurting the business pr. I would like a reply from management and would like to urge parents to stay away from Under the Sea until they improve their staff. Thanks for reading!< /Text>

{'time': 1521062589732, 'text': 'Dear Giovanni,\n\nOur playground has a policy of not allowing physically aggressive behavior between children playing at the facility.\n\nI have investigated this matter with the person working that day and have learned that on a recent previous visit your daughter was hitting other children who were also at the facility to have fun.  On that occasion your daughters nanny was asked to supervise your daughter but no attempt was made and she remained fixated on her phone. A number of parents complained about your daughters behavior and another became very upset after she hit her 18 month old child.\n\nThis is obviously a serious issue that we cannot allow. As such when your daughter and her nanny arrived on the day you are referring to, your nanny was told to please supervise your daughter or they would be asked to leave. I believe this is when you were contacted since your nanny did not speak english.\n\nWe do not like to have to do this but it is unfair to the other children and parents if we do not try to resolve these types of situations.  In the very rare case that we are unsuccessful, we unfortunately need to ask visitors who are unable to observe our safely rules to leave. We apologies that the situation did not resolve differently.\n\nSincerely,\nManagement'}< /Response>

<Review>The lady behind the counter is extremely unhappy with her position and she gave us attitude from the minute we walked in. She didn’t ask us how many we are in the party and told us after she charged my credit card we needed to pay $4.5 for extra adult. Which I was fine but she said she wouldn’t charge credit card base on the low amount. I asked her to show me a sign for credit card minimum and she started yelling and asking me to leave. She threatened to call the police which again, I was happy for the police to get invoiced because she needed to learn some lessons in costumer service. She is extremely rude and angry for the fact that other parents aren’t watching their children and she has to do it. She literally said that. She’s alone here and overwhelmed by all the work. I also asked for a main office phone number or a manager / supervisor/Owener and she yelled I DONT HAVE TO DO THAT. This lady needs absolutely more training. She’s got short and red hair, if you found your way that way be aware ....< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Christian our sale contact was amazing. Super nice, not pushy, and had great communication. As we were driving from about 2 1/2 hours away the communication was really important!
Steven (finance guy) was great, super smart and areally nice guy. Obviously tried to sell extended warranty and all that, as is his job, but took no for an answer and didn't keep pressing the issue which was very much appreciated! Very thorough explanation of paperwork and answered all our questions. It was our first dealer car buying experience and went pretty well! We love the car!!!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Simple and straight forward.  Oil change and look at the breaks.  I didn't give a 10 because there was an issue with a sensor stating the brakes were worn. They stated they didn't know why it was going off.  A false alert and being told it was fine can and will lead to people ignoring it when it is legitimate. A better answer was needed.  It isn’t a dealership problem.  It also is happening on two other owned Corvettes.<//review>

Christian,George and Steve made my car buying experience pain free. I was treated with respect and they worked diligently to make sure I had a great shopping experience. I highly recommend this sales team. No high pressure and they worked hard to get me the right finance. I highly recommend Premier Chevrolet,Hyundai of Seaside<//text>

Everyone was extremely helpful, friendly, and professional at Premier Chevrolet/Hyundai. The sale staff, including Karl and Richard, as well as Chris, their Finance Director, were able to answer all my questions expeditiously and with clarity. Top notch crew. I would highly recommend this dealership.<//Text>

It’s my second time being served by Nate. He’s very helpful and made the maintenance of my car as quick as it can be. Had a very comfortable time sipping coffee while waiting for my car. And a complimentary car wash!</Text>

I want to start by acknowledging Nate for his service but the work on my car has been very suspect.
I have a '18 ZL1 1LE and I almost exclusively track it. After each track day I change the oil and have the car serviced. Recently I brought the car in for service and I was told I had scored the discs by not changing the pad soon enough. I had been expecting the brakes to need service for some time so I was not surprised that they were in need of maintenance, I was however surprised that your service department had let me leave the previous time  with less than a track day's worth of brake pads. The idea that Premier Chevrolet has so little regard for it's clients that it would allow them to take a car with limited BREAKS to the track is worrisome as is the fact that the car was in Premier care previous to the break damage but took no responsibility.
So the breaks needed to be ground and I paid to fix your oversite but it did not end there. As I mentioned I almost exclusively track this car, the next time I was on the track my breaks vibrated. They vibrated so violently that I left after 2 sessions because I was afraid I would crash (I had paid $750 for the day plus loss of work).
I was so upset I considered never going back to Premier Chevrolet.
Some time later my wife informed me my warranty was ending and I had a free service so I brought it back and explained what had happened to Nate. I was informed the breaks had hot spots and it would be another $2200.00 to repair. I have since received the car and I am currently under the belief the breaks problems have been resolved but the discs do are now unattractive and the wheels appearance has been compromised.
In addition the damage originated due to Premier Chevrolet having not change the pads nor mentioning the condition as they should have, so I now have been led to believe my car was ready to track 2 time when in fact it was not. That Premier Chevrolet would allow it's clients to endanger themselves and others around them is in itself unconscionable but that they would then charge me to fix their mistakes is beyond reproach!
I was brought up having been taught "it is not whether or not you make a mistake it's what you do after that is important".
Premier Chevrolet held its client responsible and denied culpability.
I give you an "F".
I don't trust Premier Chevrolet or it's service department (this is not the first instance, I had  a rear tire that corded 200 miles after they put it on and they took no responsibility then either) now I am compelled to check there work before tracking my car. The problem is I am a driver not a mechanic and if I can't trust my local dealership who can I trust? Maybe I should just sell it.<//Review>

<Review>Nate was great. Although I would have like better feedback during the time my truck was serviced.
I texted and called various times with no return. I’m sure it’s busy down there but people need to know the status as it evolves.</Review>< Pics>

Check in was easy.  After 4 hours I had to call and check if car was ready for pick up (oil change/tire rotation/small recall).  Disappointed that car was not sanitized, oil change window reminder was missing (had to request).  Oh, thanks Premier Chevrolet for the long screwdriver left sitting in my windshield wipers.

Doubt I will be returning to this dealership.<//text>

<Text>I had an appointment scheduled and was told i would get my car by the end of the day. If i would have not called no one would have let me know that they needed an extra day. And then the extra day turned in to an extra week where i was never informed of what was goin on
Again until i called to see when it would be ready
And when i called they told me the car had just started to get worked on after sitting for two days.
I also had to struggle a lot just to be able to get a loaner. They told me they did not have one yet pulled one out of the back parking a few moments later .
On top of that they damaged my front passenger side wheel and did not even bother to let me know.
The least they could have done was wash the car before they gave it back but i guess that might have taken a whole other day.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808de4f10f262ead:0x284dffef2636feb2<//GmapID></record>

I would purchase another vehicle from this place and I can also let people know that if they're in the market for trying to buy a used or new vehicle in the Chevrolet or GMC brand to try and go and check this this place out. The sales reps and sales managers were very patient, professional and courtesy when it comes to the customers wants and questions. They were not pushy or rude which is anyone knows how some car salesman's or even salesman's can be.< /Text>

Great interaction with entire team. Very satisfied with my lease price, this was the primary reason I stayed with Premier. David was great to work with through the internet sales portion. Jay was fantastic to work with for the in house sales portion. I did have to wait over  an hour and half to secure the finance portion, but all in all, it was a great experience.  Absolutely love the Chevy Bolt LT! Handles really well and all the features inside are exactly what I need. Excited to help support the environment!<//Text>

This review is specifically for the Collision Center. A deer jumped in front of our work truck and we brought it to the Collision Center. David, Omar and the rest of the team went above and beyond to ensure we had a smooth, simple, transparent and professional experience. The communication was excellent from start to finish and the truck looks brand new!<//Review>

<Text>We took our Chevy Volt in to have the engine  looked at for revving, that must have been ok. They suggested an oil change and the front brakes needed pads and the rotors turned. We got the $80 oil change and took it locally for the brakes, turns out the pads still had 90% left on them. I don’t recommend them.  We used J and D Auto repair to have the brakes checked. We highly recommend them!!!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Celia greeted me with a smile as soon as I drove up to the window for my servicing of car appointment.  And she took care of everything immediately.  I waited for the car to be serviced for a short time in the wonderful lounge.  The technician checked and serviced everything in the car and even washed it.  Wonderful service and beautiful dealership!<//review>

Poor communication while vehicle was in for service. Multiple phone call attempts to try to find out status of vehicle. Employees do not answer phone nor do they call with updates when promised. I did receive a call from the dealer asking if I would like to schedule my vehicle for maintenance-while my vehicle was already there.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I am very disappointed with my latest experience at Premier Chevrolet Service Department.
Here are the reasons:
1. Upon my arrival to retrieve my vehicle from the Service Department, I had to wait for assistance out front of the office even though I was standing in plain sight of the 4 individuals working inside. It was only until I walked right up to the window (within less than 6 feet) when one of the staff bothered to open the window and offer to assist.

2. Upon receiving the invoice for the services performed on my vehicle, which was supposed to be a simple front driver-side tire replacement and rotation of all 4 tires, to my dismay the cost of the service was astonishingly astronomical $280!! It took massive restraint on my part not to say anything right then and there about this charge. And I can see it on the face of the person assisting me that even he was skeptical about this high charge. But to make matters worse, the service technician did not at all offer to review or explain any of the work indicated on the invoice. Why was I charged $40 for the inspection and another $29.90 for the tire rotation on top of the charge of the new tire plus mounting and balancing??  I purchased my vehicle from this dealership in 2019 (perhaps it was under different management or ownership at the time?) so one would think that a simple tire rotation within the term of warranty would not be an added charge. Unacceptable!

3. And this simply adds insult to injury: When my vehicle was brought up to the front to me, the person who drove it up was not wearing a mask, was not wearing any official dealership or service department uniform/attire (instead he was wearing what looked to be a worn-out sweatshirt hoodie from one of the local high schools - North County), and was not even wearing any safety equipment - not even disposable gloves, and didn't bother to leave open the doors of the vehicle when he got out. I thought to myself, "Who is this guy?" "Some day laborer, they just picked up from down the street?" Again, totally unacceptable!

4. Finally, the vehicle was not cleaned in the slightest. No offer was made to wash it or even make sure that the floormats were at least dry from the wet shoes that were obviously in it from the service personnel.

So, I hope this explains to you and staff why it is I will never again bring this or any other vehicle back to Premier Chevrolet.

And, yes the dealership can make this at least somewhat right by offering to reimburse me for the cost of the tire inspection and the rotation.

Thank you!< /text>< Pics>

Nate Volland was my contact and he was courteous, professional and helpful. I assume that the actual work was correctly done—new software and a fuse recall. But I have no way of knowing for sure about that.</text>

Such a nightmare i experienced with Premier Chevrolet. I purchased a $60k vehicle from them late December. The truck was not completely assembled because of a "backorder" on parts, however i decided to take it anyway as they assured me the coming weekend the parts would be in and i would have a complete vehicle. Fast forward a month of waiting and a million lies from salesmen, managers, and service, my parts finally are in, im scheduled to drop my truck for half a day for install. Well it took 3 weeks, im privy to tech work and i know this shouldnt take more than 6 hours.

Long story short i have a free oil change with them, but i will not take in my truck unless i have too. There is a reason dealership service departments are rated the worst place to take your vehicle, if i could change where i purchased my vehicle believe me i would.< /text>

<Text>We arrived at the dealership to have our car serviced and were greeted by very friendly staff. While we waited for our car we spent the time talking to one of your salesmen Jay. He was extremely polite, friendly, courteous & knowledgeable. It made our wait fly by. Our car was done in about an hour and everything was great! Our experience was a great!

No manuals included with the car we had to wait for them to be sent. Back seat seatbelts were buried under the seats, never prepped to be used. Had to dig them out and with no manual how to release the seat bottoms it took some time to get it figured out.< /Review>

It was my first oil change in California and I used the BG oil "Engines of Life" Program in Tulsa Oklahoma.  It was not available and no one there has ever heard of it.  Also negative is the waiting area was horrible.  Two chairs were falling apart.  Only positive is that it did not took less than an hour to complete.< /Review>

Absolutely wonderful people at the dealership. Can't say enough great things about Heather McElhatton and Chris Conley. Both know their business inside out , and a such a pleasure to work with.
Easiest purchase of a new vehicle I've had, usually buy a new Corvette every two years.
I looked all over California, Nevada, and Arizona to find the right car. Found the car at this dealership, sent an email and Heather responded right away. We exchanged some numbers, she had a car to sell and I wanted to buy. She knows her stuff and we reached a deal that , I believe, satisfied both of us.
I drove 2.5 hours to Seaside and Heather met me at the prescribed time.  Chris, finance manager, had everything done and waiting for me. The transaction literally took minutes.
Next time I need a car, I'm finding Heather.</review>

Being a car salesman as well, I often catch myself being extra critical of the purchase process. I called about at least 20 cars at other dealers, which were all subpar( the sales people and the cars). I had begun to give up hope before coming across the preowned vehicle I was looking for at Premier Chevrolet. Everyone was great and went above and beyond to make sure my purchase went as smooth as possible. They were more than fair right from the get-go so there was no haggling necessary.(haggling sucks!). I drove over 3 1/2 hours to get this car and would do it again. Thanks guys! 👌🏼<//Review>

The most disreputable dealership with which I've ever dealt. Reached agreement on the price of a new vehicle only to find out that when I was completing the transaction paperwork with the finance guy there was an additional $4500 buried as a down payment. This is despite the fact that I confirmed no less than three times with the sales manager that the bottom line figure on which we agreed was the total, out the door price, inclusive of everything. Additionally, I made it clear the entire time that I would be paying cash, not financing. Who would look for a down payment in a cash deal? When I uncovered the discrepancy I stopped the transaction. A day or more later I receive an email from the dealership. I respond, indicating (stupidly on my part) that will still move forward with the purchase. 5 days later, still no response to my email (and a subsequent follow up email). So, I decide to call. They ultimately and remarkably tell me that they no longer want to honor the price at which they originally intended to sell me the vehicle. Amazing. Run as fast as you can from this dealership.</text>

I bought my new car last year in March and it was very easy! It was a trade-in and I figured it would be a headache, but they helped me transition quickly. Thank you Andres and team for your great communication and hard work to get me such a good deal! Can't wait to come back and get our truck, one very happy customer :)< /Text>

I have been meaning to write this review sooner. I have come here twice now and oh my what a difference versus Salinas. The customer service is outstanding on top of the work that gets done and the amount of time and effort they put into not only resolving the issue with your vehicle but cleaning it after. This last time the work done was not covered by my warranty, the gentleman I spoke to ended up giving me a small deal. Everyone that day was so kind and made my experience awesome. Definitely will be back when the time comes!< /text>

These guys were able to diagnose and fix the issue I came in with.  It seems the $160 diagnosis fee to drive the car around the block and then make a quick adjustment is excessive.  Given that it couldn't have taken more than 20 minutes or so, that amounts to almost a $500 an hour labor fee.  Incredibly not worth it.</review>

She even updated me even when she was already off!! Wow! Talk about decidication! I was really impressed by her personalized service. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to buy the car because somebody beat me to it! Ugh! But anyways it was a great experience! She’s a true gem to this dealership!</review>< Pics>

Was charged over $250 per hour for a job that booked at 4 hrs. Was Initially told that it was covered by warranty by two different people. Was blatantly lied to by 2 people. Was told they had to remove the bumper to do the repair which is not correct. Finally was told I would get a refund as Chevy was covering part but not all of the repair. I should file a BAR complaint.  Still waiting for my refund. I will never use this dealer again.</review>

<text>Took my vehicle here this week. I have kids that are hard to control when we have to wait a long time so I made sure to call ahead to make an appointment. They told me the price of a diagnostic test over the phone so I was expecting to pay that much also they said they would be there to greet me when I got there. When I did arrive I was confused on where I needed to park and the staff just watched me from the window drive around confused and never came out seeing to see if they could help. Then after I walked up to them,  I told them I had made an appointment and it was like they didn't care. They were not busy and I waited 20-30 minutes just to talk to someone. After I needed a ride which I had told them ahead of time I would need and I was still waiting another 30 or more minutes for that. When my car was done I also made another appointment with the driver to pick me up at a certain time because again I have kids. They had me waiting for 30 plus minutes and they didn't even call to say they were running late. I had to call them several times before they answered to make sure they were coming. When I finally got there I had to ask them to help me because they were just going to sitting there watching me struggle with kids and car seats. When I finally paid they charged me a lot more then they told me what a basic diagnostic test was over the phone. I was very upset. Those prices are set. Why change it for a struggling mom. I drive a 2006 car that is falling apart. Do I look like I have money to spend. I feel like the staff over all is lazy and do not care about their customers. I will never go back here.</text></record></dataset><record>

Just got my third car from Peninsula Chevrolet! Past Wednesday my 2nd car's engine light was on so I made an appointment for Friday service. On my way to work I stopped by and go visit my friend Andres, yes! We have become friends (When you meet a person first time you knew right away he/she is a good person to be friend with). Anyway, I was looking for a used pickup and learnt that Roberto got to it first, lucky Rob!  After Andres took me to look around in the lot and tested drive one. Then I decided to purchase a new one instead. Took a little longer to process than last time even though I pay cash. (They did offer a 0% for 72 months! but I don't get the discount.) Nate at Service Department allow me to leave the 2nd car there early, that's nice! Overall Peninsula Chevrolet's sales, service personnel are probably the most friendly and knowledgeable. A lot better than Cypress Coast Ford and MY BMW IMO. Thanks again Andres, Roberto, Chris, Leigh, Chad and the man Stan (First time I met him today! And yes, I always there, it is like a man cave! Got all those toys, check out the new cars and have a coffee all free! Ask any questions, they are there to help! Definitely a good place to hangout. Make sure to stop by Chris office to ask him about the penetration of the "All seeing eye"!</Review>

I recieved the service I requested. I was able to interact with some very friendly people like, Barron in sales, and the shuttle driver at the time of pick up who's name I've unfortunately forgotten. Lee, from service, was patient with me.
Together the staff was able to help me but this came at an unnecessary pace. After they diagnosed my car troubles the first time and I was unable to handle the issue that day, I left without a notice that my car was unsafe to travel in or any recommendation to have another person pick me up. Clearly it's my fault I wasn't able to handle the situation immediately; the team was aware of how far I traveled to get there and failed to warn me.
Then, I essentially had to negotiate for things that were already included in my warranty. I was threatened to pay for a rental car, and lied to about their methods in communicating to me that my car was ready for pick up.
Though I appreciate the work and care that went into this service transaction and all persons involved, I feel more disappointed at the corporate level for mistreating their employees, (from an outside perspective of course).
I feel like there'd be fewer issues if corporate would pay more attention to this site and their needs as a dealer. It shows when a team has to jump through hoops to get a job done and I place this review soley on corporate management. I didnt wish to leave such a review, but there are some things that cannot be bought with money. I encourage corporate to show more love to this team in Seaside.</Text>

Dropped off my vehicle 10 minutes ahead of my scheduled appointment time for a basic oil change, tire rotation and check over. I was told it would be a couple hours, which I thought was excessive, but was ok with. After over two and a half hours with no information from dealership, I stopped back by and the service advisor not only didn't know where my truck was, but she didn't know it's status at all. The tech happened to walk into the office with some other repair orders at that time and said he had the paperwork, but that the truck wasn't done and asked her if she wanted it finished, stating that it didn't list a time on the repair order. I left with a promise that I'd get a call when it was done. After 3+ more hours, I finally got the call that it was finished. This was six hours after drop off for a very basic service on a SCHEDULED appointment. At that point, I had to rearrange my schedule for the next day to get the vehicle.
When I picked up the vehicle, I was told that they were only working with one tech and would be hiring more. My problem is with the lack of communication and that no one seemed to have any idea what was happening around the department. I've worked in dealerships for over 15 yrs, and as a parts manager, I generally had a sense of what each vehicle was there for and it's status. As a parts person! To have a service advisor not have any clue where or what was going on with a vehicle is really amazing to me. That's a huge part of their job. The lack of communication is horrible. If the job is going to take longer fine, but tell the customer, don't leave them in the dark. Most people can be fairly understanding, delays happen. I would have been fine with it if I knew ahead of time.
I did see that $20 was taken off the initially quoted price, which I appreciate. The quality of the work seems good and my truck was very clean. The only other problem was that I was told my struts are leaking, but there was no notation as to the severity or how quickly they should be changed.<//text>

This is the most disgraceful dealership I have ever encountered. Literally did a bait and switch on us- Barron who we were dealing with, gave the excuse that "he was new and had no idea what he was doing". I really don't think that's an excuse for the waste of our time. My boyfriend spent his 1 day off in weeks coming all the way to Monterey in an Uber for this. It's a shame because I have been a proud Chevy lease owner for the last 4 years but now will need to go to a different brand. If I could give 0 stars I would. So bummed out and we feel like we were taken advantage of.< /review>

What a joke and waste of time. Agreed on price, started procedure and raised price, ..agreed on new price, continued with paperwork and they raised price again, agreed, continued and they raised price again, I was about to pay and then they raised price once again ...I walked out.
Went to the other Chevy dealer in Salinas, agreed on price, paid, drove out.
Seaside dealer is horrible, but great experience at Salinas< /review>

<Text>I walked in to Peninsula Chevrolet looking to test drive a Chevy Volt and was delighted to leave with a car perfectly fit for my needs, a Hyundai Ioniq.  Barron Gilford did a fantastic job, listening to my needs in a vehicle, providing me access to test drive vehicles and included manager, Said Perez to help me determine what would work for my lifestyle without a forced, hard sell for a car.  What resulted is they found me a perfect Ioniq Hybrid and the transaction was not an all-day event.  Every member of the team was respectful and Barron was consistently attentive during my wait.  Even Stanley, from Hyundai kindly dropped by to share his personal experience as an Ioniq owner and answer the many questions I had specifically about the car.  The final joy was meeting Chris who puts the “fun” in finance.  Together, this team are unlike any other car experience I had and are more consultants than salespersons to allow a more comfortable experience in buying a car - even if you’re not ready to buy.

I must add the Peninsula dealership family: “Hyundai and Chevrolet/Cadillac/GMC” are consistently superior in quality service and I had planned to purchase my next vehicle from Peninsula because of the excellent, responsive customer service I’d received from Marvin, Service Manager and his team at Peninsula Hyundai - so it’s comforting to know my little Ioniq will continue to be in good hands for upkeep service.

Many thanks to Barron, Said, Marvin and team Peninsula for being supportive professionals in my car needs!</Text>< pictures>

I will never go to this dealership again.  Service department is awful. I had a vehicle recall which they could not fix after going there 3 separate times! They could not seem to get it together on ordering the correct parts and had to order and reorder and reorder. Each time they promised to call me once the parts came in but then never did. I had to call them! I would go down there, wait each time for hours and then find out they ordered the wrong part! On the third time I spoke directly to the parts manager who assured me he was on top of the issue and he would personally handle the situation and call me himself within 2 days to set up an appointment. Two weeks later and he never called. I decided to call GM to complain. They set me up at Gold Star Motors in Salinas. Gold Star did a great job and got it right the first time. I would never take a vehicle to Peninsula Chevrolet again, as I do not have confidence that they would do any job correctly.I have never been treated so badly by a dealership. Horrible!</Text>

Skipped part of the service I was paying for and specifically asked about beforehand.  They did take the car back in to finish but that meant my appointment took twice as long as planned.  Didn't tell me when my car was ready even though they knew I was waiting for it in their waiting room.  Tried to sell me a remanufactured part for $800, but I (easily, same oem, from many sources) found the same part online for under $200.  If I need service on my Cadillac I take it to Natale's.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Took my car in on a friday to get a diagnostic run on it. Was told it would take an hour. After not hearing anything for 2 days called in and was told the car was in the shop and had been since friday. Called for 3 days straight trying to figure out what was going wrong olny to get choppy answers or nothing at all. Ended up taking a full week just to finish the diagnostic then nearly got overcharged on parts to "fix" it. Finally got it back only to have the check engine light turn on the next day. Never going back.<//review>< user>

Went in looking for a truck for the dad. He knew what he wanted and after hours of asking for a 2wd single cab truck in a conservative color such as black or white we were still being pushed into buying a truck with 4x4 that they had on the lot for the same price that they’d give us a truck that was 2wd but did not have on the lot. We did not want 4x4 even if the price was lower and we tried our best to make that clear maybe they were just trying to clear up space on their lot but after hours of working with the salesperson we were promised a truck that they had in stock but would just have to have transferred a price was agreed on and we left a cash deposit. A couple of days later we receive a phone call to inform us that they were not able to get the truck they had promised but instead had found a “similar” truck in a different color but the catch was that it would cost us $3,000 more than the price we had agreed upon. Clearly upset we said that if they were not able to find us the truck they had  promised us for the price they had promised us we would be returning for our deposit the next afternoon. The next afternoon came and we called to inform them that we would be going for our deposit to which we were informed that that would not be possible as their financial person had already left for the day. Overall extremely dissatisfied and are glad we did not end up making a purchase with them if buying a car is this difficult something is clearly wrong somewhere. Also don’t leave a deposit for a vehicle they can’t show you as it may just lead to a headache that lasts days.<//Review>

<Text>VERY SHADY DEALERSHIP! Talked to manager DJ and online manager SAIED PEREZ. They will agree to anything over phone but when you get there, they will not honor price and try to sell you a used car with 700 miles as “new” I don’t know if there is such a thing as winding back the mileage on the odometer but there is NOWAY a car with 700 miles looked that’s used up. The seats were clearly old and the mats were beaten up. DROVE 2 hours there to be tricked! VERY VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE!!!!!BEWARE. I normally do not write on yelp and this is my first time to warn everyone about this dealership!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Peninsula Chevrolet has purchased the ole Butts Chevrolet and thank god... I had stopped getting my truck serviced here with less than stellar experiences on multiple visits however, I started back with the change in ownership less than a year ago.. The staff was very friendly and courteous. I ended up taking an interest in a new 2500 Silverado which they were so willing to let me own... The sales staff were all friendly and easy to do business with.. I also got numbers right away and there wasnt the infamous back and forth for 6 hours like in San Jose... Keep up the good work< /Text>

Had a horrible experience!!! Especially with DAVE first they didn't want to take my coupon, then he was rude when he had to take the coupon because the manager told him to take it. Later I returned for oil leaks and he told me it would be ready at 5 and I get there and DAVE tells me I have to leave it there until tommorow morning! I know he could've have mentioned this earlier or leave a voicemail but he chose not to! Very disappointed at the service this place provides! Would recommend to go to the salinas location.<//Text>

I had a horrible experience with these guys and will never recommend them to anyone I come across.

I wanted to lease a hybrid in an effort to reduce my monthly commuting expenses. I stopped by Peninsula to look at the Chevrolet Volt. Chris Rogers at Peninsula told me that when signing a 36 month lease agreement with Ally Bank they let you keep the $7,500 federal rebate for hybrids. I quickly looked at the numbers and determined that that would put the monthly lease cost (down payment included) at just a little bit less than $130 per month after you back out the rebates. It sounded like an incredible deal to me that you could rent a car like the Volt  for  a little bit less than $130 per month. I questioned the numbers several times as they almost sounded too good to be true (and I have an MBA). Chris and a couple of other people at Peninsula assured me that the information they provided me with was accurate. They also added that the government wants to put cars like that on the road. At that point I signed the contract for a 36 month lease on a Volt.

I told my friends about the amazing deal you could get on a Volt lease (after I had confirmed with Peninsula that they could get the same deal). One of my friends who was interested in leasing a hybrid reached out to Peninsula and was provided exactly the same information as I was, but ended up not leasing a vehicle.

A couple of weeks later a friend of mine in a different city told me that she reached out to her local dealer and they told her that the information Peninsula had provided me with, could under no circumstances be accurate.

At that point I contacted Ally Bank about the $7,500 rebate. They deferred me back to Peninsula as they were not aware of any special consesions.   I then reached out to Paul Goraya, the Finance Director at Peninsula to have him provide me with the exact details of how I could get the $7,500 federal rebate I had been told that I could get when signing a 36 month lease with Ally Bank.

After more than half a dozen contacts with Paul Goraya (phone, email, in person), he finally confirmed that the information they had provided me with was completely wrong. i.e. You don't get a $7,500 federal rebate when you sign a 36 month lease and there are absolutely no exceptions when you sign a 36 month lease with Ally Bank.

Despite the fact that I had asked them several times to confirm the information they provided, which they did, both over the phone and in writing, they refused to honor the information they provided. They  refused to compensate me in any way shape or form, not even a portion of the $7,500 they had assured me I would get. They only left me with the option to return the vehicle. This was after I had returned another leased vehicle I had to another dealer.

After my experience, and with other nearby Chevrolet dealers like My Chevrolet in Salinas or Community Chevrolet in San Jose, who are higher volume dealers, I don't understand why anyone would want to do business with these guys. I know for a fact that I'll never do business with them again nor will I recommend them to anyone I know. If I could give them MINUS 5 stars I would.< /review>

I called numerous times several hours/minutes apart to try to get my oil changed. Each time I was sent to a voicemail. I left messages which were not returned.

Your lack of customer service is very disappointing.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I took my car for a diagnosis and they did not find a fault and they say that if I took it they are not responsible for an accident that I may have. So what do I do with his defective car ... until he kills me :(

<Review>Friendly and communicative staff.  Sadly skills for electrical and computer aren't up to par.  Couldn't repair my vehicle or had equipment to reset codes though they did try according to them.  On that note I do believe they probably do good work with older makes that dont require as much computer codes.  Im only rating my experience as they did not fix issue at all or catch the other issues my vehicle had.  I dont like giving mid level ratings unless service was extremely lacking. And this time that wasn't the case.  But being that my repairs weren't at all repaired, is the only reason for my rating.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Cartech saved our family vacation and were so nice and accommodating doing it!

We (a family of four) had our car serviced before a recent vacation to the Eastern Sierra before leaving.  Among other things, we had a rear brake job done.  While passing through Livermore on a Saturday afternoon, the car began to vibrate with a very low frequency rumble - clearly something was wrong.

I called Cartech at around 2:15 pm and, even though they were scheduled to close at 4 pm they said come on in.  They quickly identified that the parking brake had been overtightened, causing excess friction in the right-rear brake and damaging the rotor.  They also identified that the front brakes were badly worn and, given the mountain driving to come, might warrant replacement.

They fixed the damage to the rear brake without charging any labor, just parts for the rotor replacement and replaced the pads on the front brakes for a very reasonable price.  They test drove the car before giving it back to us and measured the temperature of all four brakes before signing off on the work.  We were back on the road by 4:20 pm.

All through the process the owner and his children (it is a family run business) were as nice as could be.

While on vacation in the Sierras, we put the brakes through their paces over mountain passes via winding roads with long and steep descents.  Through it all, the brakes performed flawlessly.

If Cartech were closer to where we live, it would now be our go to mechanic shop.

Thank you, Cartech!  Thanks to you, we had a wonderful time after you saved our vacation (on such short notice!)</Review><time>1594342337491< /time><gmapID>0x808fe713e85b3f6f:0xc4f7aa08c05190c9< /gmapID>< name>

<text>I have never been more happy to write a review! I called Eda several times about a pre-purchase inspection inquiry. I was planning to look at some used cars in livermore and wanted to have a good mechanic in the area available to take a look at them. The owner was incredibly kind and took the time to speak to me on the phone and answer some mechanical questions and concerns, and offered to check both cars for me at an extremely reasonable rate, and the same day! Eda answered all of my questions and my multiple calls with such kindness. I did not end up finding a car in livermore, so I was not in need of the pre purchase inspections afterall, but have never experienced such amazing customer service!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My daughter’s car broke down in Livermore on her way to San Francisco late Friday night.

I called in the morning, and they were able to squeeze her in, install a new alternator, and get her back on the road before noon.

I am very grateful for their kindness, understand, and quick service.

As a father concerned with her safety, they put me at ease and took very good care of her and her car.< /text>

They are excellent.  When I had an emergency repair they were the only ones able to help the same day.  Next time I used them their quote came in 60% below my former mechanic, saving me $1500.  Once they accidentally quoted me for 2 leaf springs instead of 4 on a big job, but they noticed and threw in the extra parts and labor for free.  Plus they are friendly and happily provide drop-offs and pickups.<//Review>

My wife and I have taken our car here a few times and have always been pleased with the friendly accommodating service and reasonable pricing. Most people's fear of mechanics and other trades (mine as well) is finding someone you can trust. No worries here! We recently took our car in to have the squeaking  brakes looked at. We were quoted a price up front should front, rear, or all pads need to be replaced (included resurfacing of rotors), and extra for rotor replacement. Much to our surprise, we received a call from the shop stating that the pads were still good, and the squeaking was only a symptom of heat. We were not charged anything for this diagnosis. We were prepared to spend something for replacement or at least assessment, but were pleasantly surprised to be told nothing was due. That is the right way to do business, and we wouldn't take our car anywhere else. Thanks Cartech, we'll be recommending you guys to anyone we know needing automotive repair services. Top notch!</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We've been taking our four vehicles to Cartech for years now. They are fabulous! Rafael and his crew have handled everything from putting a rebuilt engine in one vehicle to letting us know that the gas cap was being cranked down too tight causing the 'check engine' light to come on- no charge for that one despite the time it took them to check it out! They've always charged a reasonable rate for whatever work they have done. Somehow despite always having a bunch of vehicles to work on they get our vehicles back to us asap- seldom more than a day.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Fast, easy, cheap, and moral.  These guys are more competent than dealership techs, and they have a genuine interest in ensuring that the hunk of metal that you drive out of their shop will be safe.  They will repair any very small (but critical) problems for free over the course of their involvement with your vehicle.  In addition, their prices are extremely fair, and they can get you in and out as fast as you can communicate your problem to them.  If they aren't too swamped, they will also provide cab service.  Their work comes with the typical 1 year warranty.

This is a thorough, experienced, and caring shop.  Highly recommended.</Review>

She left one of my eyebrows super thin and took off a chunk on bottom that is not fixable not even with any type of eyebrow filler. The owner assured me she was good and ended up leaving me worse than when I pluck them myself. I should have just stocked to waxing<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been to the Hanford location and it was always a great experience. I now go to the lemoore location because it's much closer and each visit is always wonderful! The lady who does my brows is so sweet, friendly, and does amazing threading. 10/10 this is my go to place that offers high quality threading and high quality customer service.< /text>

< Review>
I’ve been to this place like 4 or 5 times & each time my eyebrows didn’t even look like they were done. This last time one of the ladies (not the owner) completely cut all the hair off the end of my right eyebrow & kept the left one long. I’m gonna be filling in my brow for at least a month. She didn’t even try to make them symmetrical. I am so livid at the fact that she really ruined my brows like this.< /Review>

Diane has such great customer service and has extensive expertise in handling fingerprints. With no appointment needed especially during COVID-19, Livescan Express will have you out the door in less than 5 minutes with no wait time! I've used them 3 times since moving here from Seattle last year and every experience is the same if not better :)< /text>

If you need a very organized and positive experience with Livescan, you have to visit Livescan Express in Ventura. Diane has all the info ready when you arrive to be in and out super quickly, and with a huge smile!!<//Text>

I called prior to coming in and she was extremely polite, informed me it would be a quick and easy 5 mins (it was) and that I'd be on my way out. I went in and she greeted me very kindly, offered me some great conversation and I was outta there! Go Live Scan Exprerss!!</Review>< pics>

Diane at Livescan Express was amazing.  I walked in feeling very stressed and talked a few minutes with Diane and came out laughing and feeling great.  Diane made the whole process less daunting, it was like visiting a friend.  I would definitely go back to Livescan Express.</Review>

< review>
Plently of space for parking, make your way down the hallway turn left rm106 and hopefully there is a place to sit. But not to worry although it is a small 3 seat lobby the service is speedy accurate and
simple as ever the atmosphere is cozy. There's free Halloween candy! Yay! *Please Note* it is each and every customer's responsibility to have their forms filled out and ID ready if you don't want to waste time. Miss Diane is kind focused and attentive to each individual customer if any info is missing she patiently and helpfully lets you know. Also if anyone knows local clientele, agencys, and employers ask your processor most likely Diane knows. The fees and rates are lower than other processors and business hours seem to be unaffected by COVID.  If you are reading this its worth mentioning to others in need of a livescan and definitely worth a second visit.  Friendly Reminder :) wash your hands and keep your cuticles clean🙌 😁👍<//review>

< Review>
This Livescan Express location is perfect for anyone looking to be greeted and treated with amazing service.

Not only did Diane, the desk representative that day, make me feel like the job was going to take less than ten minutes, but she interacted with me as a social human being instead of operating like a robot.

She is very encouraging and polite. Five Stars, by default, because of her work ethics.

These folks are fabulous. I live in San Diego and was not able to use them for their services. However, I have had problems getting my results. They spent over a half an hour on the telephone with me, at no charge to me, to explain the process and how I can rectify the problem.  I could not endorse them any more than I am saying right now. They are fantastic. 5 Star!

My dad was in a hurry at that time and fortunately, we found this gas station that is quick to serve customers. We're so happy that our car was full tanked and was running great again. Thanks for the fast and great service.<//Text>

Very busy location but the price is competitive. The owner does not gouge your eyes out and then rip off your cash. I fill up here regularly. And no homeless addicts begging for cash. Feel safe here.</Review>

<review>The lot is adequately spaced between each pumps and I never feel uneasy driving to the fuel pump.
Only inconvenience is that the place is located right at the corner of Olympic and Western.
Entering is no problem but if you need to exit AND make a left turn, you will have a lot of trouble as traffic is congested here.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>THEY ARE DECEITFUL!! They don't honor their prices. I picked up something and it said $3.18 on the price tag. However, when I got to the register it was $3.49. I asked the cashier would he honor the price on the tag he said NO. It's not a lot of money ; I understand that but this isn't the first time that they've done this. I was going to get gas and decides to go somewhere else. Customer service and principle should mean something. Not at this gas station.. So, I'll go somewhere else...If you chose to shop here check the prices because they are DECEITFUL<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

If you haven't already, join their rewards program! You'll save money on gas. This location is always cheaper than the others, so I go fill up here every week. So far I've received about $30 worth of gas with my points.< /review>

One of the cheapest gas stations in town. Because of that, it's filled with cars all the time. But it's worth it.</Review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Gas stations here are generally cheaper than surrounding areas, are easy to enter and exit, and are prepared to clean the glass easily.The environment is very clean, the cashier is friendly, and the quality of gas is good, so it is easy to manage the vehicle, and it is also stolen when using a credit card. It is seen as a place to use with confidence because there is little risk of it.

이곳 주유소는 가격이 주변보다 대체로 저렴하며 입출입니다 용이하며 간단히 유리를 닦을수 잇도록 준비되어잇으며 매우 깨끗한 환경과 캐셔가 친절하며 gas의 질도 좋아서 차량관리에도 용이하며 신용카드를 사용할 경우도 도용의 위험도 적어 안심하고 사용할 장소로 보여짐니다< /review>

(Translated by Google) I think this is the best place to get close. Case by case, but there's always water and tools to clean the windshield! But shouldn't you change the water often?

< Review>
Asian man was very rude to me on 9-7-18. Asked me what I was doing walking around and told me that it is a "problem, leave" and said some Chinese words to another man. Then he accused me of taking pictures. I didn't do anything like that. I still purchased my Vodka and told his wife/daughter. He still came over and told her other stuff in front of me. I will take my business elsewhere. I think he is a racist. I am a just a shopper.<//Review>

<text>I try to stay away from this place.  Everything is overpriced. They do not serve a good element to the community nor do they speak English or Spanish as a first language. Some products tend to be very old and  un-consumable but they will sell it anyway. The only thing they're good for is alcohol and even that is overpriced.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>One of my favorite places to go to get my husband his stuff he needs. Always a friendly face. When you walk in you don't feel like you are in a lab or dr office which is nice to me. And they have some great deals!!!< /review><GmapID>0x54d2ed5fae512735:0xd614d4751fa135bb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The folks are very efficient, pleasant, knowledgeable, and remembered me.
They accommodate us older folks with a smile, whether it's speaking loud enough for us to hear, or reading a label if I forget my glasses. I've never felt rushed.
I've used their delivery service. I've ordered online. Everything worked flawlessly.
A great place to shop. And lest I forget, they have reasonable prices.
They deserve my 5 stars.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Don’t often come through this parts but when I did I had a good look at all their menus and this place had the best by far. Derrick, Nick and  Brandon were so helpful and knowledgeable. This place is definitely a must stop if your in the area. Also has some accessories if you forget a torch, need papers or just want to skip the smokeshop!</text><Rate>5</Rate>< Date>

Worst shop in redding. Have had multiple bad experiences with customer service and ignored orders. I ordered couple days ago and they just didnt show up or call. Order still says they are preparing it. Save youself the hassle and go somewhere else< /Text>

Showroom was tiny, impossible to stay 6 feet away from anyone or anything. When they are helping more than one customer at a time it gets clostrophobic.</Review>

<review>Vibe By California: A great new collective in Redding.
Friendly security, plenty of parking and a staff that knows what they're talking about.  They have pricing
stickers that are after tax so you know exactly what you're spending, which is great, in my opinion. My favorite feature is they take debt cards (maybe credit?) which saves me a trip to the bank because most of the time other clubs ATM's are out of cash, mostly in my experiences. Wide open space so you can see their products and a nice fridge that holds the edibles, just like in a grocery store. Didn't feel like I was being rushed. I'm probably forgetting half of what I was going to write because the good prices I ended up getting a gnarly infused preroll for half the price I would get anywhere else, and here I am now writing this review and enjoying this beautiful weather knowing there Is yet another GREAT collective in Shasta County. Cannot wait for their grand opening. Will definitely show up!<//review>< Pictures>

<username>randy harmon<//username><Review>I was new to Vibe and it was a nice place. I had smoked pot for many years but only previously owned one disposable pen which I liked. They did not have any disposables but had the cartridges with igniter. I decided to try that but couldn’t get it to work when I got home. Also noticed I had bought a cartridge labeled sour which did not was not something I would have chosen had I realized there were different flavors.</Review>< GmapID>

My experience was AMAZING! Natalie helped me with all of the financing and I couldn’t be more happy with my purchase of new 2021 Jeep Cherokee Latitude!! The process was fast, easy and super friendly. I told Natalie what I was working with and she made it happen for me. Thank you SO much. I am in love with my new car and couldn’t have asked for better service.</review>

I just recently bought a 2017 Dodge Ram 1500, and honestly my credit is less than perfect, I was upside down on the loan with my trade in. Norma n Jimmy my sales team worked very very hard to get me outta my previous loan and negative equity, to get me into the truck I've always wanted n needed. I'm very appreciative and humbled by my experience with these folks, and I highly recommend them to everyone in search of a new car, trade in, or upgrade. They're Awesome.</Text><user>117683459307389474951< /user><name>Ron Conboy<//name>< Rating>

We were shown a piece of paper with the price of the vehicle that we were happy with, and agreed to proceed with financing and a credit check. We negotiated the finance rate and once we were happy with the rate, we were given a "final price." The "final price" had a sale price for the vehicle that was $5000 more than the original price they quoted (the "new" price was the sticker price).  When we pointed this out they first told us that we were incorrect, and when we asked to see the original paper they said "it was a mistake" and there was "nothing they could do." The manager offered to take $500 off the sticker price, as the "best they could do." The price difference, while substantial, was less concerning than their incompetence, apparent lies, and unethical business practices.< /review><UserId.>112839321577849426171</UserId.><Rate>1<//Rate><time>1618722545708< /time>< Resp>

< review>
I had a 2015, RAM 2500 and wanted to get a new 2018 with some options I did not get on my 15.  I knew exactly what I wanted and tried to work with several dealerships in the Sacramento area.  Each time I would get the deal all worked out, the dealership would try to make some last minute change.  I got the run around for over two weeks.  I called Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and spoke with Terry Livings (Sales Manager).  I explained exactly what I wanted.  He said he would call me back in two hours and when he did he had located exactly the truck I was looking for and the deal he put together was BETTER than the best deal I had been offered at the other dealers.  This was on a Wednesday, I came in on Saturday and he the truck ready to go.  Another sales manager Marty helped us do some of the final paperwork and the finance dept. was a breeze.  My wife and I purchase cars often and have high expectations of the dealership.  These folks are the best we have worked with in many years.  It’s worth the extra drive to Lodi.  I highly recommend!<//review>

Phil was the easiest AND nicest car salesman I’ve ever worked with.  Honest, clear and no pressure. Will definitely come back to him for our next car purchase.< /Text>

<text>I would give no stars if possible. This dealers service manager Joe admitted they did not diagnose vehicle by the Chrysler factory repair manual. I feel that is the purpose of the dealer otherwise you can go to any shop. Good luck anybody going in for service at this dealer.
If the owner Leonard Harrington of this dealer really cares about customer service I hope they reach out to me. I have also filed a complaint with Chrysler regarding this dealers service center.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Phil Cunha was a delight. He made the buying process fast and easy. He’s a straight shooter and we were able to get straight to the point so I didn’t have to waste my entire day in the dealership. I had a great car buying experience.< /Text>

This dealership sold me a truck with aftermarket alterations that caused catastrophic damage to the axle on my $50,000 heavy duty truck.  They do not return my calls, respond to emails, certified letters, or even the Bureau of Automotive Repair!  But they certainly respond to all of the positive reviews left for them.  As soon as there is a problem they scurry and hide.  The last I heard from Hope, the service manager, she was supposed to call me back on October 28.  Still no call.  I did receive a call from Shannon Reilly, the sales manager, that they would fix the axle at their dealership only.  He said he would send me details of the repair offer by mail.  January 2021, still not a call, letter, or even an apology that their repair shop toasted a $10,000 axle.  Shannon, I’ve left you 4 messages, where is my offer to repair that was ‘in the mail’?

I look forward to my day in court. I will also publicly post the judges/arbitration orders on this review.<//Text>

<Review>Ram 2500 cummins

One star says it all....no need to make it long.

Agreed price thru text was $59,411 OTD. Drove 2.5 hours with my family and wasted another 2 hours at the dealership, incorrect price.

Was ready to take the truck for $59,411 even with the dent on the pass side door and the 2 paint chips on the Dvr door....glad things didnt work out.....would have driven me crazy on a black truck.<//Review>< user>

I had a great experience buying a new Jeep Cherokee at Lodi Jeep. Andy, the sales representative, made the purchase process extremely smooth. He showed me multiple options within my budget, he presented me the pros and cons of each vehicle, and ultimately he helped me deciding among the multiple options without being pushy. I would definitely recommend my experience with Andy and Lodi CDJR.  I also had a great experience with their service department. Rick and team were extremely knowledgeable and helpful.</review>

<review>It’s interesting how all the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars.  I also find it interesting how many people have had good experiences at this dealership when many many more have not.  As soon as a 1 star review shows up, they counteract it with 5 star reviews.  It’s pretty simple to look at the dates of the reviews and how they correspond.  They always say that the negative reviews are the ones that people write, so what is incentivizing the 5 star reviews??  Hmmmm, maybe it’s a free car wash.  Whatever it is, it’s certainly not an accurate depiction of what is going on at Lodi CDJR. One review here states a customer literally witnessed the acknowledgment of a bait and switch between manager and salesman.  WHAT?!  How is this company still in business?!</review>< pics>

I took car to a body shop to get detailed and they pointed out to me that the vehicle had been damaged before so bad that the paint don’t even match. Never payed attention to it at the angle the shop showed me, also when I was doing contract they never disclosed that they were charging me for security system that I never asked for in the first place until I was signing I saw a charge asked them what it was for they said we install this system in the cars so we have to charge you for it. It’s a good tracking system don’t get me wrong but they never told me about hoping I didn’t pay attention. Then yesterday when I called them to disclose what I had discovered there answer was that’s what you get for buying a used car. I guess in a way there right but just want to make people aware of my situation please people do business elsewhere.

<text>They wanted to charge me multiple service hours for a simple item repair  that was left incomplete (GPS reset & re-calibration).

I want to love this Dealership, but unfortunately have been left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I sold a Jeep back to them recently and the overall experience was great.  They gave me a fair price and made it easy.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the service department. When I picked up my car I had to pay for a repair that was never completed. On the way home my wife was not only able to diagnose the problem, but also able to fix it in a matter of minutes. No extra computer skills or equipment necessary. I struggled with the service department to get a refund and instead was told it was my fault and I needed to pay for the technician's time. "Fighting for the customer" was never a concern. I was told it was a potential warranty repair, but then was not given any break in diagnostic price because nothing was "broken." In regard to warranty repair I was simply left hanging with a bill. Tim's customer service skills are horrendous.  Hope, (the service manager), was pleasant after the fact and only charged me for 1/2 hr. diagnostic, but too little too late. I was still charged for something they never fixed (and we fixed before we even got home- insert eye-roll here.)< /text>< Pictures>

This place is a joke I purchased a car here 3 monthes ago the alternator and the battery already went out. The service department dosent help at all they want you to pay to even open your hood. This car was supposed to be matnienced and fine but I’m having to pay 500 for repairs. I purchased 3000 in extra warranty’s and nothing is covered I paid extra for nothing don’t buy from here go to any other dealer ship they just want money</Text>

This place has the best customer service hands down! They went above and beyond to get me the trade that we really wanted . We had went to the dealer in Newark and they seemed like they either didn’t know what they were doing or just didn’t care.They ran my credit and left empty handed bc they couldn’t find me a deal, I had to put $8,000 down in order to trade my car I was loosing hope after that. But  After calling around and my husband found this dealer in Lodi and just by talking to them on the phone I really felt like that were really trying to help and that they care. Long story short we drove from Fremont to Lodi after they had told us they were able to do the trade on our truck. We walked out that dealer ship with our brand new 2021 truck with a low rate! Of 4.6 ! I went from 11 or 12% to 4.6! Like wow! If I could give Chuck and Steve more than five stars I would give them 100! I’m sooo happy and so thankful for them! Thanks again guys for doing the impossible for us!<//text>

Worst service department I've seen in a long time. Called twice on a Thursday to make an appointment, Ring/No answer. Called the following Saturday morning to make an appointment, transferred to service dept.three times, Ring/No answer. Drove to dealership. Waited for service, no acknowledgement of my presence by two service techs. Sign said open on Saturday to better serve you, by appointment only. You can't make an appointment because nobody is answering the phone. From now on...Lasher Elk Grove, will be where I go.</Text>

We pass by about once a week. Very clean, organized lot. Today a gentleman was passing by while in the lot, we were standing on the sidewalk. Asked him if he could give a price on a truck. He pulled out his phone and gave us a quick price. Friendly guy! Hope he wasn't headed to lunch. We really appreciated him taking the time. Were shopping for a truck but not ready at the moment, but I know where I'd like to check first!</Text>

Steven was utterly rude. Our interaction ended with him telling me “you don’t have the money for it anyway”. Who says that! Have a little respect for your potential clients! Was looking at a truck but the monthly came out to be too much. Went to my plan b and was looking at a trade-in fiesta that they had on the lot. The KBB trade-in value for it is $4k but they had it listed for $9k, a $5k markup than what they gave the guy for as his trade-in. They tried forcing a $1,100 gps on me as well. Such a joke. Remember, this is a business. They make not one, not two, but many thousands from each vehicle they sell. Do yourself a favor and don’t get scammed, find a good private party deal and get an auto loan from your local credit union. Dealerships like this are major rip-offs!<//text>

My first time going to Lodi CDJR to look to buy been there just looking around but i went on 1/29/21 to actaully purchase I meet Michael C which is a great help. He helped me find my jeep (anyones price range) and i absolutely love my jeep. It was a very great experience for me and my family so if you are looking for a newer car,truck,van, suv please stop by your local Lodi CDJR dealership and ask for Michael C. The staff is very friendly and they are not pushy and that is one thing i dont like is pushy people. Wondeful dealership located on Beckman Road in Lodi go check them out you wont be sorry. Thanks to everyone at Lodi CDJR</review>

The staff  is exceptionally professional and friendly and will do whatever it takes to get you the car or truck you desire within your price range and budget.

Showroom and lot is very clean, and LCDJR has an excellent selection of vehicles to choose from.

Highly recommended.</Text>

Good selection of trucks, sedans and suv's. If you are in the market for a used or new vehicle stop by or call and set up an appointment with Andy Sanchez he got me a fantastic deal on a beautiful ram 1500, he made the whole car buying process really simple and easy.</text>

<Review>They bait and switched me.  When I spoke to the manager Shannon about it, he said that they would never do that.  That it’s illegal.  After using the restroom I literally walked right into him telling his salesman to be more careful and that next time it could be a serious problem if the public were to catch on.  Wow.< /Review>< Pics>

Feb, 15, 2020 we were looking to purchase a Ram truck. We 1st stopped at a different location and were treated so badly we left.
Then we went Lodi CDJR. Met Chuck, what a pleasant breath of fresh air. Accommodating is an understatement.  We left with our Ram and have never been happier with a car buying experience. We highly recommend this  dealership,  and you won't find a better more attentive salesman than Chuck.</review>

To anyone leaving reviews of lemons or broken used cars, contact RBB law firm.  They are an auto lawyer that I have hired to handle my case against Lodi CDJR.  They are very knowledgeable and care about resolving your vehicle problems.<//Text>

<review>The salesman was nice but didnt seem to really "listen" to what we were looking for. When we finally got them to hear what it was we wanted we were then given over to their "internet specialist".  Not wanting to waste anyone's time, we asked if they had that vehicle with the options we wanted in their stock and the "internet specialist" said without skipping a beat "No we don't- goodbye."  We immediately turned and left. He was rude, disrespectful and arrogant. We will NOT be stopping there ever again.<//review>< name>

I’ve bought numerous cars before and I have never had an experience like this where the sales person was so disrespectful and pushy. My girlfriend and I saw a car that we liked online so decided to go check it out. We called because we had a question before stopping by and STEVE M. answered so we told him we were on our way. We went for a test drive and loved the car so we decided to sit down and work out a deal. Steve disclosed that he was going to present numbers first and then if we liked what they could offer he would run credit. After reviewing we told him the numbers wouldn’t work with out budget and he kept asking us what we didn’t like. I would try to explain and he kept cutting us off and talking over us saying we weren’t being reasonable and how great of a deal it was. He started to get argumentative and defensive and began getting louder and louder as if he was trying to intimidate us into buying a car even if we weren’t comfortable with the terms of the financing. I don’t know if he was talking to us in that manner because we were women or if that’s just the way he does business. He finally took no for an answer and said he would go grab our keys from the trade in. HE THEN COMES BACK WITHOUT OUR KEYS AND TELLS US THAT HE RAN CREDIT WHEN WE CLEARLY TOLD HIM WE WEREN’T INTERESTED. We now have to deal with sending disputes in to the credit bureaus because credit was checked without consent. DO NOT VISIT THIS DEALERSHIP.< /Text>

Because of Covid I called in and made an appointment. When I got there I had a salesman tell me they were too busy and come back. That got me a little upset made a phone call to the manager and then spoke to the salesman and ended up going back. I had a truck I wanted to buy and was qualified, I had more money down that I was willing to tell them to make my payments were I wanted them, we were trying to work a deal. It got tough for Alex the salesmen and another customer came in that he had appointment as well and he left me to go to him....not very good business. I’ve bought three cars from them I will never buy another. I also find it funny that the owner only comments on the 5 star reviews. There many issues you should deal with in your facility.</Review>

The salesman kept trying to talk over me and say I was wrong and distract me..I refused to allow that to happen..After much back and forth and refusing to accept what I was being told, come to find out there was $73 extra in taxes they say was an error, there was $895 added for an alarm app that I stated multiple times I did not want, nor did I ever request it.It was simply added to my papers..Finally after arguing about not wanting the alarm app, I went into finance to sign the papers..Believe it or not his numbers once again didnt match up..Upon looking, they STILL HAD THE $895 in my documents, trying to sneak it by.

Upon arriving home I noticed a small ding or dent that happened during shipping or at the dealership..I immediately contacted them and sent them pics..I was told they had a dent guy that would take care of it.  I was later contacted stating if I wanted to pay for it, the dent guy could come to my house and fix it..(a dent I didnt even cause)  I attempted to contact the dent guy twice and have not heard back.

The shipping guard was supposed to be removed prior to my arrival to pick up the car. It of course wasnt..I had to return the next day to have it done. Upon return of my car from the shop, I noticed a ding in one of my brand new wheels.  I made them aware of this and was once again given the number of a wheel guy..That once again I could pay for..for a wheel they damaged.  He returned my call and the dealership stated that if I take my car to them when the wheel guy is there the dealership MAY help me..

And finally here appeared to be an issue with all 4 of the brand new tires on the car...what appeared to be a defect..when I inquired I was told I was on my own and the dealership had nothing to do with it...I contacted Dodge Customer Care who contacted the dealer and called me back and said they were rude as hell to her (one of their own) and even yelled at her...She recommended that I find another dealership to deal with that this dealership wasnt very good.

So I texted the dealership today to coordinate the wheel and dent guy to see if this dealership was going to do ANYTHING to assist with damage to my wheel they caused, dent to my car caused by others, or address the tire issue. I HAVENT HEARD ANYTHING BACK..what a shock...

So I took it to Les Schwab and resolved the tires...Im stuck with the dent and scraped wheel that they did, and also a chip in the front bumper that was repaired by them and lasted all of 24 hrs before returning...

So shotty repair on the one item they did fix, avoidance of responsibility on the dent and even on damage they themselves caused...All the while trying to take me for over $1000 extra dollars for stuff I didnt request and even DECLINED 3 times...only to try and sneak the papers by and get signed...NOT THE PLACE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>1</Rate><username>david chilcote<//username>< time>

I test drove a couple of cars here last week I enjoyed the experience about what made me a little uncomfortable is that covid-19 is going around and when you test drive somebody is in the car with you. I test drove at other places in the same week and they let me drive the car by myself. When someone is in a car with you you have the pressure of buying the vehicle but especially during this covid it puts the salesperson and the customer at risk.<//review>

If you’re a first time buyer and don’t know exactly what you want and the terms you want it under, do not come here. I have a lot of experience in car buying and I still feel like I got screwed over and manipulated. I was rushed and pressured into making a decision and was told repeatedly that if I don’t hurry up and sign the papers, they would be “pissed” at me. The finance manager, Michael, did not explain anything to me that I was signing and the sales manager, Marty, quoted me completely different from what I actually ended up paying. The customer service overall is terrible at this location. Take your money somewhere else.</Text>

<Text>If I could give this place a negative review, I would. They’re really rude and not helpful at all. The Sales Manager Steve Magana needs a lesson on customer interaction and not be rude to customers. Saying stuff like “are you going to buy a car or are you going to waste my time” is not the way to sell a vehicle. This person also lied on the listing and discount offered and got rude when we presented a flyer to him. I would recommend to go elsewhere.< /Text></record>

Okay the only reason I’m giving a five star review is because our sales person Megan. My daughter came in and bought a dodge journey. She worked so hard to get her into a car. My daughter had some credit problems.  not once did she make us feel bad. Unlike other dealers. Megan was so compassionate, Megan said the only promise I can make is that I will work my butt of for you. And boy she did. She even bought us and my grandkids food.  Now as for the store. it’s a mess...The place is so dirty! The guy that did our paperwork was so rude! Like as if we were a bother to him. I really hated the store. The only reason we bought was because of Megan!</review>

<review>I went to the Lodi dealer as I received a recall notice. And decided to get the oil changed also on my 2013 Chrysler 300. When the car was finished I noticed the easy exit seat was not working properly. I brought it to the attention of the service guy Tom. He said since I didn't have memory seat buttons on the driver's door that it was impossible for the easy exit seat to operate. I explained to Tom that the easy exit seat was working and has been since I bought the car in 2014or 15. He said he was too busy with other customers to help me and that I should call the Chrysler dealer. , I told him that I would. In the meantime I got on YouTube. And find the video that fixes the easy exit seat. And to do that you turn your car on put the seat all the way back, then put the seat all the way forward put the seat all the way back put the seat all the way forward and then put it all the way back again. Turn off your car. Then turn it back on. And the seat went right back to where it was supposed to be and the telescoping Steering wheel also return to where it should be. So, thanks to the YouTube video. I was able to fix the problem that Tom ignore me about. That's why I only the two stars. And I want to say that this is not a reflection on the rest of the staff. All I know is if my wife is happy that I was able to fix the seat.< /review>< Pictures>

Had my daughter turn her keep in for an oil service at around 11. After being told that the Shuttle bus was out & would be back to pick her up she waited for about 90 minutes before calling me to come pick her up. After her car was completed they called her to let her know the store was closing in an hour & the shuttle driver went home for the day. This is not the first time this has happened to her & believe the customer service needs to up their ante on providing more support to their customers when they need to get back home & not stay there for the next 6 hours. We will be taking our services elsewhere & not recommending this place again.< /review>

<Text>Had gone in September they ran our credit and couldn’t get us a good deal on a truck with our decent credit. Got a call from an “upgrade” manager decided to go back to see if they offered a better deal. Tried to make it seem like we didn’t know what we were dealing with and Specifically said NOT TO RE RUN OUR CREDIT, what did they do they RE RAN either way after we said not too! We’re offered a payment like a house payment which first time was cheaper so waste of time. Make sure if you go with them that you have enough knowledge so that they don’t make you feel like time was wasted and don’t let them re run your credit unless you give consent! NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!</Text></record>

I wish you could do no stars.......
Pulled into the service area for an oil change. Sat there waiting at my car for 20 minutes. Not a single employee acknowledged me at any time. Walked inside to the cashier's desk to ask how do I get service. She instructed me to stand out in the bay next to my car and somebody would come to help me. Wasted another 10 minutes standing there. Not a single employee that walked by me acknowledged me or asked if I needed help.
Not the place I will ever go again.
Shame on you Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep!
You guys might want to take a class on customer service!!!< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Im still in disbelief this occurred. I went in Sunday May 17th to inquire on a 2013 Ram 2500 that was being advertised for $30,400.00 under 100k mikes great deal. Spoke to the Internet manager through out the deal. I looked at the truck it “wasn’t” ready which it was dirty which was no big deal. We went to his desk to talk business and work a deal. After a few minutes I was told the that the truck price had been adjusted to $37,500 I said ok no problem.

We worked a deal and got approval from a credit union everything was good to go term of the loan etc. Since the truck wasn’t ready to go I signed the document showing the loan info etc. I went home cleaned up the trade-in got it ready to go. On Monday the internet sales manager calls me and said they had issues with the truck and was deemed unsafe so had to be sent to auction. The truck remained on car gurus and Lodi cdjr’s website only this time for $38,231.

I went down to Lodi cdjr on Monday May 18th to try and figure what’s going on and I asked to speak to one of the finance managers well they wouldn’t give me the time of day. The internet manager well at-least he talked to me, but either way to pull out of a deal.

I called Lodi Cdjr this morning May 22nd and was told the truck had been sold yesterday May 21st...<//Text>< Pics>

Spoke with Andy on the phone the day before I came in about a truck I was interested in. He was overly helpful on the phone and was ready for me even though i showed up 2 hours early to my appointment. I was impressed by how well he knew all the different makes and models and specific features of the ram 2500 and helped me find the EXACT truck I wanted. He made the entire process a breeze and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a new Dodge!  No pressure sales and a genuine passion for cars!< /Review>

Went to their website and found a nice truck I wanted. It had a the MSRP and then the dealers price. I emailed them and immediately got a call from Mrs. McQueen. She stated that they have two prices and that. The one on the site and a "E" price. Said she could give me the "E" price if I came down. Drove an hour to get there only to be told that there is no other price. They would not budge. I don't like being lied to or mislead. Sales manager was pretty disrespectful in his demeanor. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.< /review>

He was very knowledgeable and did everything he could to help me and was also very understanding. I genuinely felt he had my best interest at heart while searching for a vehicle and wasn’t just pushing me to buy one like salesmen normally do. I think he deserves some type of incentive or raise. It was because of him that I felt comfortable buying my car even at the monthly payments I got it for.

There  is no Receptionist to greet you so you have to basically get into someones way to get acknowledged.  I waited 30 minutes for a courtesy shuttle before inconveniencing a family member for a ride.  Upon picking my vehicle up I went through the same shenanigans of standing in the way until acknowledged.  Oh, and all this was with a scheduled appointment.   On the flip side, the vehicle service was performed!< /Review>< UserId.>

<date>1568266495913</date><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>We have a new Jeep Wrangler. We took it too this dealership and were very un impressed. We asked for a five tire rotation as part of our Jeep wave program oil and rotation. The service person refused to do it saying that the “spare” is just for looks. I’m flabbergasted as we’ve never had this issue before at other dealerships. Additionally we had it in for a recall and when we went to pick it up we were given the keys and sent to go find it in the parking lot. No walk thru or pull up. Additionally, after having the recall checked out (something for the steering) the Jeep is now pulling to the right significantly! So now we need to have that checked out and fixed and I’m sure this dealership won’t do much. Wouldn’t recommend.<//Text></record>

<review>I went in there knowing very little about buying a car. It was my first time; 21 years old and seemingly curious. I got to test drive the car that I really liked. They informed me of all the stats on the car. At signing, I got to ask as many questions as I felt comfortable and they reassured me every time. The conversation was very smooth and it calmed my nerves a lot! This made the biggest decision of my life a little less nerve wracking. Everyone here at this establishment was super great! We laughed at jokes and got serious when needed to be. When it was time to pay the down payment, my card wouldn’t go through. So they let me take the car, I wanted to buy from them to go to the bank to get a cashiers check. That was pretty amazing. All in all, this establishment was friendly, kind and attentive! Would recommend everyone!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

We purchased a vehicle very accomodating. They told us at purchase dince i am a company with several vehicles they would take care of us asap. We ledt 2 messages with service last week no call back. We called today after being oatched thru 2 times was keft on hold for 22 minutes, then called back and disconected again. Called back forbthe 3rd no resolve to get 3 trucks services and make repairs on manufacturer defective items to be replaced. Totally opposite of what the customer service i was told i would get. 5 phone call over a weeks period and still no appointment. 3 trucks need 6 mfg defects repaired in steering, transmission etc. Cant drive to send employees on jobs. Not recommend their service.< /Text>

Never made it into the place. They are falsely advertising a Black Widow Ram 1500 at an amazingly low price and then tell you the price is a mistake. And then try to sell you something else. Shady selling practices at it's finest. They know that the ad is bogus and it's still up for at least a week now. Buyers BEWARE!!</Review>

Dodge Chrysler Customer Care is no help either!  I have not been offered a replacement vehicle or reimbursement and no one is giving me straight answers if a part is ever going to be available.  Will never purchase another Dodge and Im so frustrated and disappointed with this dealership service department! At this point it seems my only option is to seek legal advice.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I bought my first car from them and it was a great experience. Megan Covarrubias helped me out through this whole experience and explain everything. I have been to several dealers when accompanying my parents buy other cars and none have been as transparent as this dealer. They even brought out a chart explaining things like msrp,discounts, add ons, and rebates; which ultimately gave me the final price I was going to pay. I have to say I am extremely pleased with this experience. One thing I should also mention is that I bought the car at a great price, I checked car gurus and it was one of the lowest price (biggest discounts) in all California. Overall I highly recommend this dealer and Megan to anyone.<//Review>< pics>

Steve Magana is a good man, and a great salesman The deal was made pretty simple. I got preapproved beforehand, went to the dealership and found the Challenger RT that I wanted. There was no need in price haggling because that was already the best price in California for that vehicle with the options it had. Glad I did my homework. Happy Holiday's to everyone there at Lodi CDJR.

Shady salesmen. Will not wash windows in a used car so you can see the road to drive home! Beware of excessive mileage on vehicle. My car I bought (2016 Toyota Corolla LE ECO) was advertised with 42,000 miles...but the odometer showed 49,000 miles.

Ask for record of service the dealership might have done.  Carefully check the CarFax on the vehicle you wish to purchase.  The Corolla I had purchased was previously in an accident.

Don't fall for maintenance plan from them on a used vehicle. I was set up with a maintenance plan that cost $2,500 - and was an additional $250 PER MONTH in addition to the car payment.  I cancelled the plan immediately.

NEVER GOING BACK!!<//Text>

Customer Service is great. They gave me an estimated cost and a time frame. They stayed within  both estimates. They kept my truck 5 days so they arranged to provide a rental car. I couldn't be happier with their service. I recommend them even if you don't have a dodge! Service Advisor Raymond Ruiz is the best!< /Review>

<text>Me(Lisa jermanon) and Jacob marlin recently went to this car lot a few days ago and Marty Steve’s help us look for a car in our pay range. He is a really nice and helpful gentlemen and did his best and put in hard work to find us the right car and if it wasn’t for Marty we wouldn’t have a car right now . He always kept in touch with us when he found the car that we may like and he gave us a lot a good options. He was very respectful every time we visited him. I recommended everyone to go to his car lot !!!!</text>< username>

<text>They advertised a vehicle for a good price, they had that vehicle on the lot for the advertised price, and we bought it. No games, no delays and no double talk. Everyone was very cordial and friendly. Even though there were dealers closer to us, they wanted significantly more for the same auto. We would recommend this dealership without hestitation.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

We were treated very well from the minute we arrived and until we left with a new Grand Cherokee. Marty listened to our needs and actually talked us out of what we intended to buy. His insight and professional manner were invaluable. We left with a vehicle that fit our needs to a tee. Awesome experience.<//review>

<Review>I brought my vehicle in for service and was helped by Tim who after he took my keys got in my truck let my door swing ! And then after that he still goes on and peels off into another parking spot which was extremely unnecessary NEVER BRINGING IT AGAIN ! If that’s how they treat other people’s cars with them present I can only imagine when the owner isn’t there.</Review>< Pics>

<username>Tiffany Starr<//username><review>I had a great experience at the Lodi CDJR! I went in looking for a new Jeep Wrangler to find out brand new just wasn't in the cards for me right now. I had Marshall as a sales rep and Shannon as my finance rep both of which were extremely helpful through the entire process. Later the same week Marshall called us right away to let us know a jeep with everything I was looking for had come in and to come take loot. It was perfect! Shannon and Marshall were so fast with the process of both purchasing the new car and with the process of trading in my old car, I was called multiple times with updates and the communication was great! Over all had a great experience with Lodi CDJR!<//review>< userid>

<Text>The sales and finance department are by far some of the best and most professional I have dealt with got me into the truck I wanted no issues. But the same can not be said about the service department every time I have brought my truck in it has been nothing but issues. Things as simple as calling the customer back or making sure you've actually completed the job would be a good start. Had to take it back 3 times to get over spray paint removed and the job still wasn't finished after the 3rd time and now the call my employer to get ahold of me for a shuttle ride when not 10 minutes before I had given them a number to  Call me. All in all i would buy from lodi dodge for all my cars but avoid the service department if you want your vehicle and your sanity!<//Text>< pics>

<review>Put this on yelp and figured google should also have my novel of a review. I'm so highly disappointed in the level of service. We are wanting to buy a new RAM rebel. The initial experience was good although short, we knew exactly what we wanted. We didn’t want to waste anyone’s time going on multiple test drives, bringing out cars, etc. We had an appointment elsewhere and had to leave but we filled out the credit app and they (the sales manager/sales person Hensol Cline lll) said that they’d get back to us that afternoon/evening.

Didn’t hear back.. I get that it gets busy, I used to sell cars. Even when it got busy though I was able to multi task and get back to customers no later than 24 hrs (Maybe our dealership had diff standards). So we didn’t hear back until I called them Monday late afternoon/evening. To receive numbers on a car is typically a 20 min process on average even with about 4 deals at the desk. There weren’t that many customers, the sales people were standing out front talking and our sales person was complaining how slow the foot traffic has been. Anyways, when I called I listen to the sales person cut me off multiple times to tell me he didn’t have numbers and how busy it’s been and that he’d get back to me later. At this point I’m annoyed because we’ve been patient it’s been two days and it feels like we are getting brushed off.

70-80% of a sales persons job is following up and at the very least being courteous. I called again to ask for the sales persons name because I wanted to write this review and I get transferred to the sales manager. I told him I just wanted my sales persons name and he wouldn’t give it to me. He then went on to rudely say “I have a pile of deals here what do you want me to do”. To which I said I just asked for my sales persons name (now I know from the business card I found it’s Hensol Cline) then not long after the sales manager abruptly ended the call. Your team is a reflection of you sir.

I still waited to write this review until my dad got called back. He did finally, he missed it because he was driving and called back and they told him that the person putting together his deal is out and will be back tomorrow and they’ll call us then. 2-3 people told us we’d get numbers today. At this point it’s just unprofessional and honestly a lot of games.

I’ve never been treated so poorly. We’ve bought many cars from ford to Jeep, Nissan and 3 from Mercedes. We always we get backend, give perfect CSI’s and it’s generally a very easy experience. Never ever has buying a car been this painful. I would never recommend any of my fam/friends or previous customers of mine to come here.< /review>< Resp>

< Review>
Went in for recall repair.  Was told it was just a software update.  Brought vehicle in was told a part was needed.
Brought the vehicle in service rep took VIN # to schedule appointment.   To not get this done and have to reschedule is frustrating.  It has been a week and have not heard back on status of part.< /Review>

I recently had the best experience at CDJR!! Larry Jr. was the salesman that helped me and he was professional, knowledgeable and kind. I didn’t end up purchasing that day but if/when I do, Larry Jr. will be my guy! Very nice to encounter someone professional to work with!< /Text>

Extremely shady dealership.  Bait and switch.  Price was agreed on the phone, 1.5 hour drive to arrive at the dealership and was told car had gps and fancy window treatment they cannot take off.  They even tried to put it on the sales contract hoping I would just sign and not read it. You really think I was born yesterday?  I know there are suckers born every minute but come on!!!   They lost a car sale due to nickle and diming. Went to Roseville Dodge and had a much better experience, very straight forward and no hidden cost, no fine print.</review>

I recommend this company 199% Raymond in Service, CeCe at the desk and Jose our driver were all wonderful !!! Thank you Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram< /Review>< pics>

By all accounts from as far as I could tell the sales department is great there honest, and if your leaving here unhappy the truth is you either didn't listen when making the deal or you shouldn't be buying a car in the first place, I have financed two vehicles here without issue. Also I would like to point out the service staff "For the most part" are also a good group special shout out to a couple tech I know still work there that know there stuff George peck, he's a hell of a mechanic and is honest he won't recommend it if you don't need it. Also he does everything you pay for. And Dave  That being said I realize there is all ways a couple bad eggs in the basket, if you feel you had a bed experience just specifically ask that that same mechanic not work on your cars anymore. I do feel this company did me wrong but that is not here nor there, I am a former employee who was laid off "was told it was due to lack of work" this time. I do believe that over all this is still a reputable company and for the most part is good to do business with.</review>

They did amazing job getting my husband a car but when we try to show them that it has hard water stains on the whole car they try and blame it on my husband when the car wasn't even a week old and they didn't clean it at all it was really dirty when we got it, when we were told that it was all cleaned if you buy a car from them make sure you look at the whole car before driving it off the lot.< /Review>

I love my car.  However, the service center at this dealership is a joke.  Pathetic. Unethical and sleazy. Evasive. This is not hyperbole; I am not exaggerating. Under no circumstances would I recommend buying a car here because they can't and won't support it.  Specifics: brought my car (less than 10k miles in) for repair - they *started off* the conversation by telling me they probably wouldn't be able to resolve my issue - that something that was happening *while a service writer watched* "probably wouldn't be" diagnosed and fixed. Instead I got an earful about how "hard" it was to fix FCA cars "these days." Well, they were right, issue wasn't resolved! Instead, they broke something else.  And went silent - they won't respond. The service manager refuses to return calls and won't respond to emails.  Ditto whoever is running their social media.  They even refused to work with the national DodgeCares Twitter account after I contacted them for help. Really!  Amazing (at least to me) but true. I have extensive documentation of all of this and more!  I stand behind every word I'm writing, I'm happy to share copies of everything. When I have time, we're gonna have a conversation in front of a judge.  Find another dealer.
Post script update a week later: as you can see, several days have passed and the dealer hasn't responded; because what can they say? I can tell you that they haven't reached out privately either. This should tell you everything you need to know.<//Review>

I bought a 2016 Subaru from Lodi dodge I drove it for a week I got a ticket for my ex system that came with the car when I bought it I called the dealer and they told me it's my responsibility cost me $1500.00 drove it for approximately two months the engine blew up When I bought the car I was told the car had a factory warranty  on it so I did not buy an extended warranty so when the engine blew up I had it tow to Subaru they checked it out and I was told it needed an engine and it would not be covered under the factory warranty And the reason why was it had aftermarket parts on it I call the dealer and talk to the GM He told me that it's not their responsibility I bought the car with those parts on it  The dealer told me that I could put those parts on so what I did I got a hold of the original owner I talk to him he told me that he install those parts when he owned the car so after the car been with Subaru for two months It cost me $8000 plus a rental car for over 2 months and the general manager will not even talk to me about it it's really sad they would treat the customers this way I could not make the payments on the car and pay for the engine so I got three months behind on my payment so I could pay for the engine and kept the car stay away from this Dealer<//Text>

Went in "just to look around"...Mike the Sales Rep was patient, answered all my questions, and made me feel very relaxed and didn't put pressure on me to drive off the lot with a car. I appreciate that... thank you Mike. Jimmy in the finance dept had us walking out confident in our decision to make our purchase without regret. Great place to stop and look around! Highly recommend Lodi CDJR.<//Text>

Phillip and Andy were very good.  No pressure.  I liked that I was not attacked when I first drove in to look at the Chargers/Challengers and  all the sales staff were standing there but they let me look and did not swarm me.  I love my White Lightning.<//review>

We had a check engine light issue and they took us in right away.  It took several days since they had to order the parts.  When th parts came in, they realized they only had one but before calling us, they called around to other dealers and the tech picked up the part on his way home and installed it the next day.  Raymond, our Service Advisor, and Cliff, the technician were fantastic to deal with.  Thank you.</review>

< Review>
Been dealing with a salesperson an one of his managers trying to help me in a rough spot current repo an super bad credit score told me to bring in 6k I said okay then I found out they have a current cash allowance/ incentive I was simply asking if it could be applied to the downpayment I was told no even whe. It could be they would have to work a deal to try to make it happen but no one tried and was talked to with disrespect the salesman did great but his manager was rude and didn't wanna even try his best to help in anyway an told me " I cant help you" now I BBN you want the current dollar days deal you wont get it cuz once tax title an license comes out you dont see the incentive/rebate and when you ask them to try an see if the bank would even take it they refuse   will be making a YouTube video on this bad situation and go from there and explain incentives on

Owner took the low road ban bashes my credit score because I called to explain my review an why I gave a 1 star very disrespectful when a customer gets yelled at by your sales manager who didnt TRY TO HELP BUT TOLD YOU HE DID AND THE GENERAL MANAGER GETS ON   THE PHONE DOWN TALKING SOMEONE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM AN HANGS UP IN THERE FACE THAT SHOWS BAD LEADERSHIP< /Review>

Service extremely lacking. No call back as promised. I've received better service from a used car lot. My big thanks for buying two vehicles in one week from these people. Never again. I try to keep my money in Lodi but I'm never going back to this joke of a dealership.<//text>

I WILL NOT RECOMMEND DO NOT GO HERE.
The service of this facility does not even come close to the need of recieving a star. (Negative STAR needed)
The service department is filled with COMPLETELY RUDE and ARROGANT people.
Even the manager I spoke to was rude and disrespectful.
Buy a Jeep ELSEWHERE.
I WILL NOT RECOMMEND Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, 1255 Beckman Rd, Lodi, CA 95240

I was out of town for work while my truck was in the shop but I knew I did't need to worry because I knew it was in good hands.

<Text>Felt as if management (Shannon) was talking at me and not to me as an adult and closing the door for options and wanted cash and No alternatives. Disrespectful is how I can put it. Charlie was the biggest help with revealing a same truck but used and I was fine with that for closing the deal to meet everybody’s needs.

1st experience dropping my car off and the service advisor Tom locks my keys in the car by pushing the lock button and shutting door with my keys inside. I picked up my car a week after dropping it off due to needing a torque clutch converter that was under warranty. I get it back and a few days later a faulty job on the converter caused it to lose all the transmission fluid while sitting in my drive way. They had it towed and fixed that.  I have been hesitant to drive it since. Noticed the hood was not shut all the way. I opened it and found dealer tools in my engine compartment. They called me and wanted to buy the vehicle back, I can see why now. They wanted their tools back with out taking responsibility for leaving them in my engine. Im dissatisfied with my whole experience.< /Text>

HA yeah they locked my damn keys in the car and I had to wait an hour outside with my daughter and fiance for the locksmith to show up to get my keys out.

The only thing that was good about my experience with this dealership was the deal on the car I bought. The salesman didnt care about any questions or concerns I had once he knew I was sold on the car, if I hadn't needed a car so badly I'd have walked out. When I bought the car it had a plastic trunk liner, they had the car derailed and it was gone when I came to pick up the car. I have brought it to their attention 3 times and keep gett ing brushed off. Just a heads up to anyone looking to buy a car here they're not looking for your satisfaction past the moment you purchase.< /text>

<text>If you want to over pay for a new or used car, come here! Only dealer I’ve been to that is completely unwilling to “deal” with the customer. I had Andy as a salesman and he and the sales manager were unwilling to lower the sticker price on a brand new vehicle! I’ve bought many cars and EVERY dealer drops the sticker price because they all know it’s marked up so they can make the most money, even when they “do you a favor” and drop the selling price. I would never suggest anyone to go here and I will never return.< /text>< pictures>

Not only did i email Terry before posting on here, with no response, but he responded to my review to contact him. Which, I tried again twice, and still have not heard any response in almost a week. Somehow this does not surprise me. Maybe contacting Dodge themselves might help....

Worst experience ever! Was called derogatory names when I said i wanted to go get my pink slip to my old truck and my check book for the deposit. Emailed the manager and never got a response. Very happy with my Chevy i ended up purchasing elsewhere. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!<//review><gmapID>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2<//gmapID>< user_name>

<text>The service tech Sara was the best part of this experience. The rest of the experience was less than stellar. From the service cashier who could not be bothered with my questions to the fact that it took 2 days just to get someone to look at my truck before even starting work to the over inflated cost of the repair. I thought Lodi CDJR was under new management? Nope, same story just a different book cover.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Wouldn't let me give no stars so had to do one star just to post. Very upset with this dealership. Took my Jeep in to have the tow package activated and go pick it up they say it's all good. Get it home and no lights for the trailer. Take it back and they want to charge me again just to look at it. Don't go here drive the distance to go somewhere else< /text>

Really wish I could give ZERO stars! Took my 07 Caliber in for an oil change, made an appointment, show up early and they have no record. Was told it'd be about an hour (I sat in the lobby from 8:50am-11:20am) - The guy that helped me was a joke!( his name is Raymond) Not my first time dealing with him. Each time I go in he belittles me. I know my car, I keep excellent records of all services done ( by me or by the dealership) He made the comment he's not use to women knowing about the mechanics of a car. ( this is where I lay into him ans tell him I am a Mechanics daughter was taught how to work on cars before I could even reach the pedals! ) and this time as I was walking out of the service department he whistles and mumbled something in Spanish. I've heard how he is with female costumers VS the males. Don't be so sexist with your customers. I am in the market for a new car and will NOT be going back to Lodi Dodge ever again!< /text>

<text>DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! THEY ARE EXTREMELY NICE WHEN YOU FIRST BUY THE CAR. THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK IN. THE DEAL WE MADE THE NIGHT BEFORE WON'T WORK WITH THE BANK. SO, THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER CONTRACT AND SAY THIS IS THE BEST THEY CAN DO. YOU TAKE IT BECAUSE YOU WANT THE CAR. THEN TWO DAYS LATER, THEY CALL YOU AGAIN AND SAY YOU OWE THEM MONEY BECAUSE YOUR TRADE IN LENDER MADE A MISTAKE ON THE PAYOFF. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I GOT A PAYOFF QUOTE STANDING THERE IN THE DEALERSHIP AND GAVE IT TO THE SALESMAN. IN REALITY, THE DEALERSHIP WROTE THE WRONG PAYOFF BUT WON'T TAKE THE BLAME. I GO IN AND DROP OF THE CHECK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER AND TELL HIM I WON'T BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM THEM AGAIN AND WALK OFF. AS I'M WALKING AWAY HE'S CALLING ME BUDDY AND TELLING TO WAIT. SO, I STOP TO LISTEN AND ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS TELL ME NOT TO COME BACK AGAIN AND STORMED OFF. WORTHLESS!< /text>< Response>

Called them and spoke to Norma and explained the features we were looking for. She said we have a few for $31k. So we make an hour long drive with a one year old. When we arrive they show me the vehicle she sent a video of. No sticker in the window but it’s nice and we continue on with the process. Manager comes out with a $41k msrp after rebates. Completely lied to to get me in. Wasted my time for nothing.</Review>

They are the worst dealers i have ever dealt with. I went to check out a used car there and found out that the listed price on their website is incorrect. They wanted to sell this car to me almost 3k higher than listed on their website. On top of everything their manager Jimmy was rude to us.< /review>

<review>Salesperson lied. Now I find out the finance company didn’t agree with the terms but will agree to modified terms that were sent to the dealer. Called the dealer and was transferred to the finance department. No answer twice. Receptionist said they are busy and get back with me right away.

Lodi CDJR worked with us when no one else would. Our salesman, Mike and manager, Terry, did everything they could and got us into a perfect brand new Grand Cherokee. I will never buy from anywhere else. They earned customers for life!!<//review>

I went in  for my regular oil change are usually take it in every 3 to 4 months and this time that I took it in my car was there for over three hours after they told me that they were going to do a tire rotation and in oil change and after the third time of me calling to see if my car was ready for pick up they said that they did not do the  tire rotation because I needed new tires and an alignment, mind you this is a brand new car (2016 )and I’ve had less than a year.I am curious as to why they never did a tire rotation on any of my other for oil changes and why my car was there so long for an oil change I’m not happy with the service and I most likely will not be bringing my car back.</text>

Terrible experience, recently purchased a brand new 2917 Chrysler 300 in October and it has been in the shop over 5 times now for the same issues over and over.  This past visit I was able to bring in 2 videos of the separate issues as they occurred and the generic response I get it “we can’t duplicate it”.   Smh terrible service, any other dealer I’ve dealt with in the past would’ve held onto the car until it was fixed.  They would’ve trouble shooter with other local dealers and mechanics, but instead it’s in and out.  If car isn’t replaced or bought back I will be taking legal action under CA LEMON LAW.< /Review>

HORRIBLE dealership .

We were getting ready to head towards a dodge dealership in gilroy cause they offered us a deal , Lodi called me and said they’d match it .

We drive an hour to Lodi , they offered us a payment 230 dollars more than what we were offered from the other dealership . He basically chuckled and said it’s not possible for us to get something cheaper . Mind you , this was a 3 year lease with 740 credit score .

It was too late for us to drive to gilroy so we went to Manteca , they offered us 520 a month , 3 year lease and the process took only an hour . On a 2019 scatpack with 3 Miles . They told us 630 for a 2018 scatpack with 200 Miles .

I suggest you guys head over to Manteca dodge instead . I hope the manager and finance guy from Lodi sees this .</text>

I was stranded in Jackson ,Ca and Tom was amazing in taking care of all the details to repair my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and get me back on the road. Everyone else was quoting me weeks before they could “fit me in”
Thank you Tom and all the folks at Lodi Jeep for rescuing me and getting me back on the road so quickly!< /Review>

Called this dealership about a car I wanted the salesman was nice enough on the phone so I told him when I would be down, I didn't expect him to know me or run out on the lot, but no one came out to greet me as I walked all around the lot,(that never happens at any dealership that I have been too, that should have been a red flag) So I called the salesman on his cell phone and he told me the car I wanted was on hold, the car ended up being on hold for 3 days when supposedly they don't do that. They sold the car, but I found another at a different dealership. The two stars is for the salesman for his follow-up; the dealership and its management get zero stars. Based on the few reviews posted this place is hit or miss.<//Review>

If you know what you want and how much you want to spend find.

Otherwise the sales staff which will Jack you around tell you what ever lied that is convenient and do whatever they can to make a sale.

My pickup had to be washed twice. The first time it was returned covered in greasy smudges and the windows were smeared.
The previous times it was in for serice I was charged $10 for the tire rotations. This last time I was charged $25 for the rotation. Not sure if it's due to new ownership.<//review>< pictures>

My 2000 Cirrus is a garage sitter & occasional short trip taker. It has 34000 miles on it & when it requires service or any other mechanical attention I leave my vehicle in the qualified hands of Chrysler certified mechanics Lodi CDJR. If I have anything done to my vehicle it is going to be done by a mechanic that specializes in Chrysler. Lodi CDJR is honest, reputable & serves their customers with courteous, professional service which has a touch of personal care incorporated with the manner in which their customers are valued...   ;~)< /text>

<text>I brought my 01 dodge ram in to diagnose what the issue was with my fuel gauge and to see if my water pump was going out because of the noise it was making. A job that should take 5 min took all day and I never got a straight answer on what they did to determine that in fact they were both bad. Charged me 160.00 dollars to do a safety check. What a joke that is. They said they checked my brakes but they never took the wheels off and I have drumb brakes. How do you see through the wheels I would like to know. Also the guy helping me was not a help at all. Ramirez at Lodi dodge never answered my calls and made me wait once I got there for 30 min to sign some paperwork. Then I had to wait while they had to go find my truck. Terrible!!!<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Horrible experience with the service dept. We have taken our 2017 Ram 5 times to fix the windshield wipers from coming on by themselves. We ended having to take the fuse out to drive the truck around. The 5th time it was in their service dept for 5 days. They called us to pick up. when we got it, The fuse was still in the same spot where we left it and once we put it in, sure enough the windshield wipers turned on and we couldn't turn them off. How are they going to keep our truck for almost a week and not fix a damn thing.. I wouldn't never recommend this place it to anyone.</Review>

<review>I did not have a good experience with you guys. When I picked up my car from having a new PC put in it there were some things wrong with my car and I was told that nothing could be done to fix them. & I don't understand why not because my car was fine when it got towed there, despite the PC, and when I got my car about a month later my air bag light was on, my back seat was lifted up not latched down like it was before, also when whoever had to get my door open with a wire or whatever because somebody lost my car keys they messed up the weather stripping in between my car door because water leaks through now. And my door handle was broke throughout the process of my car being there which I was called back there to get the door handle put on but somebody ordered the wrong one and it has been at least another 2-3 weeks that my car door handle has been broken. I am not a happy customer.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Bad customer service, I purchased a Jeep Patriot 6 months ago from Daniel Ochoa. The car wasn't driving well and I brought it back to the dealership the same day I drove it off the lot and he told me to bring it in and services will take care of it. Went there on two different occasions without appointment they couldn't look at the car let alone fix it because they didn't have technicians for that time, i made two other appointment I finally got the car in today and I was told I have an extended warranty that don't cover the problem and I have to pay out-of-pocket $500 plus to get it fixed worst part is I spoke to sales manager Eric and he is the worst customer service person I have ever come across in my life he actually told me none of this was in writing. Apparently nobody put this in their system and mention that the car had a problem from the jump when I got it and that I had been there three different times with no solution to this and mr. Ochoa don't work there anymore (bad news for me, Great for them) and this Eric of a manager had the nerve to say he cannot say if I'm telling the truth about the car having this problem when I bouhgt it so there is nothing he can do about it..DON'T BUY FROM THEM..Ridiculous customer service and dishonest people.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>At the beginning very friendly and kind stuff. But when the things go rough everything changed. My brand new 2018 charger begin to shake badly afther 20 minutes  left the dealer and when l call them they just told me to go to the nearest dodge service. And that was my last talk with them.
Afther that , from the sales person to the sales manager and general manager nobody answer or return to my calls.
Also , when l check my purchase details l found a different for.2.820 Usd over charged to my total amount. Than l learn from the finance manager that he add 1.370 Usd for GPS trucking system together with windshield protection. ( In the beginning he said the GPS is coming with the car together and never mention for any price or payment )
And 1.450  Usd for 6 years mechanical coverage. . ( l reject all the additional insurance and coverage offers from the finance manager while the signing process but still add the coverage. )
Afther talk couple of times with the second finance manager ( l couldn't reach to the first one as expected ) he said that l will get back the mechanical coverage and windshield protection but the GPS can not removed from the car....
İ am 58 years old and change my car every 3 - 4 years and this was my worst worst experience ever..<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Stay Away!!!
Summer of 2017 (June)
Dodge caravan was misfiring really bad. Took it to dodge and they put a left cylinder head in my caravan keeping it for couple weeks and costing $3200. Took it home and found filter air box and wires were loose and not secured properly on and around the manifold. 8k miles later cylinder head was leaking oil.
Summer 2018 (June)
Took it back to dodge and the said yes it is leaking they will order head gasket kept van for a week. Service dept. Calls me and tells me camshaft also needs to be replaced i give a go ahead which is another $290 for camshaft and 6 rocker arms and 6 tappets. Got it back on saturday evening and found airbox and all the wires loose again and couple of metal brackets. Was very upset sent videos to the dealership rightaway and they said they will make sure my advisor gets the videos on Monday. But on sunday i take van for a drive and it felt like misfiring again at a red light and while driving. I got back in dodge and told em its heating up after the rework and getting only 16 miles to a gallon when it always had been getting over 17 in city and also misfiring. They send a tech with me on a drive. Engine did shutter i could feel it but tech sitting in the back seat could not (van does not have front passenger seat or middle row). It has loss of power i told them and i can clearly tell. I told tech my van and advisor my was leaking oil from cylinder head but atleast it was running fine and after rework now on cylinder this engine is not the same anymore. They said we will hook it up and see if there is a misfire. Nothing else we can do because we worked on the cylinder head. I said yes you took all apart and worked on the cylinder head and might have missed something when putting everything back. I am a regular driver of the van so i know when van is not acting right.  Advisors are nice but techs don't know what they are doing. It is too much headache. Trust me stay away from lodi dodge service depts. Its been nothing but pain. I am stuck with a broken van if they dont fix this sudden engine sutter/thumping issue. What makes dodge think after after missing work for 3 weeks, repais costing over $3600 and stress about van that i will come back to them for service?
JUNE2018
Dodge said they could not any misfiring symptoms etc. and maybe a ignition coil pack going bad. They give van back to me...
JULY2018
Only after 8 days  and less than 1000 miles later van was back at the dealership it was leaking oil from the cylinder head again 😔. Tom advisor said leave it and we will look at it. Next day Tuesday tom calls me and tells me they will order a whole new cylinder head and crysler said part is back ordered and estimate arrival date for part is July 31 2018. I said thats almost 3 weeks😤😟. Advisor also said that's not a guarantee they'll have the part on that date.
JULY 30 2018
i call dealership to get an update... Advisor said they got the part and tech is working on the van as we speak. I said ok good thanks.
JULY 31 2018
i get a call from advisor that they were putting cylinder head in and a chunk of block came in techs hand. He said bolts threads came out and now van needs a new Motor.  He said dealership spoke to chrysler and Chrysler said they will cover Labor cost to put in new motor but not cover the new motor. Tom said new motor is $5800 and the 2nd option is to trade in this vehicle for another vehicle. Really Dodge? 😠 I said Tom i have missed 6 weeks of my work so far from June 2017 to July 2018 because of dealership keeping the van. I have spent over $3600 and problem is still not fixed and on top of that dealership messed up the engine and chrysler is asking me to pay for motor? And not to mention the stress i took every time they keep the vehicle and i miss work. I have lost clients and am at the brink of losing my job. I said dealership took it apart 3 times in those 3 visits i made so far,  they should cover everything. Tom said i will tell my boss and they will be the one making the call. 8/14/2018 They made me pay for used LKQ motor $2441.61 :(< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Lack of personality and very unclear on their process of selling a car. The sales man didn't  seem interested in selling, no effort or personality. The sales manager very unprofessional I have never came across these problems while car buying seem like they were trying really hard to rip me off or not even make the sell. I'm probably buying my car somewhere else.</Review>

DON'T go here for service. I brought my perviously owned Jeep Wrangler here for a general service check. First I wanted them to see why the traction lights wouldn't go off. Additionally, I wanted them to check the brakes and any other issues they might find. They ended up "resetting" the traction lights, changed the oil and transmission fluid. Was told the brakes were fine. $500.00 later we left. The next day the traction lights came back on, was told I could return in about a week for another appointment.  Two months later and approximately 200 miles the brakes started to grind, took it to Les Schwab and we ended up having to replace all four routers and brake pads! Additionally, we were made aware of 3 recalls that Lodi never told us about. I recently took it to Carson City Jeep for the recalls and they informed me the water pump was bad, the oil pan was leaking and the recall took care of the traction lights. There was NO way Lodi could reset the traction lights because there was a faulty part that the recalls took care of. Thanks to Carson City Jeep My Jeep now runs great!!  THANKS FOR NOTHING LODI JEEP!!!   I like to spend my money locally, but I will NEVER return to this service department again. If I could I would give them zero stars</Review>

Honestly I wouldn’t come here and do business with Lodi Dodge again.... I rather go to a different dealership. The person “ helping” me  didn’t even have the time to let me speak. Everything was rushed, they say what you want to hear but don’t be fooled. I asked the sales person and the finance manager if I would have to contact the dmv for anything after trading in my car, they said no so I would confident of not having to worry about the dmv sending me anything later in the mail about the  old car.... BUT nope, a month and two weeks later I got a letter saying I need to renew my car registration “ the car I traded in” even though I signed off that car I still got this notice. I read on the DMV that I have to fill out a form out and I tried but didn’t have the option of trading in the car info so I contacted the sales person that helped me and told me “ it happens all the time no worry I’ll have my person send you a copy” later on that day got a message saying they weren’t able to get the copy for whatever reason so I called the next morning and talked to the finance manager and told me I should just ignore it, it happens all the time and I don’t need to contact them about it but HE WILL SEND ME A COPY OF RELASE OF LIABILITY... a couple of hours passed by and still didn’t get a copy sent to my email. Waited until the next day mid day and messaged and called  the  person  who “ helped “ me and no response. This place is very unprofessional and deserves  zero stars.</text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I am very pleased with my experience here at Lodi Dodge. I am originally from Stockton, and had a horrible experience at my Dodge location. I looked around online, and came across Lodi Dodge, and I am very happy I did! This location has a wide variety of cars, new and used. The salesmen, and mangers here are very nice and respectful, unlike Stockton. My husband and I been eyeballing the Dodge Durango’s for awhile now. They have a good selection here, and my husband really liked the black one. The salesman let us test drive the car, and we got to experience the Durango’s full potential. Having a toddler, and a 3 months old baby, we needed to upgrade to a bigger car immediately. The vehicle is very spacious, and accommodates my children’s car seats and strollers perfectly, and still has A LOT of space left. We are pleased to say the Durango best fits my family, and our needs. After going over some numbers, our salesman, Jose Delgado, got to work things out for us, and got us approved for a good deal on the Durango. Jose was very nice and straight forward. I am happy to say we came here looking for a Durango, and left with one the same night. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone, Jose Delgado, and the rest of his team, are very professional and nice. My family will be doing more business with them in future for sure.

I recieved great Service from Raymond Ruiz at Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram. I came in for an  air bag recall, and they inspected the vehicle for other problems, and discoved that the front brakes were severely worn. Since I had just purchased the Jeep from Carmax the week before, Raymond suggested that I bring it back to them for service. I have scheduled an appointment with Carmax.

Very disappointed . I took the car in to have keys programmed and was given a quote for 80$. The estimate said customer understands that there is no guarantee the fobs would work since they weren't bought from them. Ok I can deal with that... Left the car there overnight and get a call that the keys aren't programming with the car. They tell me it's 165$ to run a diagnostic to see if the computer modules bad and asked how much this would run me if it was the module.she says about $365. Later after they did the diagnostic I get call saying yup the module is bad, and I the total to repair was just over $1100, don't want to proceed,?. And that and I had to decline for now. When I go to pick up the car, it's $245 to get my car back and im told I'm being charged the 80 for the attempt to program the keys plus diagnosis. Now wheree did it say customer understands or acknowledges if the key doesn't program I still have to pay $80. I was already having to pay the diagnostic of bad news  The female who acts like she's running  the place was not helpful nor very friendly, when I asked about this she said there was nothing she could do, that whether or not it was programmable she had to pay the guy who tried. I asked to speak to the manger only to be told he was off , how on Earth can u charge someone for a service you didn't get without disclosing this could happen? Can you imagine if I would have said ok to go ahead and replace the computer module going wit the earlier quote  of 365.00? And been then be told I'd have to pay 1200+ when I showed up for my car??! I'm livid that I had to pay 240 to walk away with nothing . I'll never use this dealership in the future and you have been forewarned. Price gouged and no disclosures.<//Review>

<text>I went in to get a diagnostic test done to find out whats wrong with my truck. I asked how much and if they would find and report the problem. The guy wrighting up tag yes to if theres a problem that it will be found and reported, cost would be 160.00. The next day the guy calls me and said were going have to run a compression test for another 500.00 dollars to figure whats wrong.my reply was,"so your telling me 660.00 dollars then you possibly still wouldn't be able to tell me whats wrong? He's reply was yes. I say thats not what you told me and im comeing to pick my truck up. I pick my truck up and the paperwork was changed from the original to benefit the guy that wrote it up with rearrange words to benefit him or i should say the dealership. And i still had to pay 160.00 for not one thing that they did but lies. I strongle beleave they dident even look at it. Due to there inspection reported said a bunch of things that were lies. Like i neede a new air filter, and a major service and flush on tranny. Less then a mo. Before i changed the filter and 2 filters/fluid in tranny. I bet there hasent been one elderly lady that hasent been taken addvantage of ...... I no was ripped off. And lied to.

<text>I have bought 2 vehicles from Lodi CDJR. in the last 6 months.  I will continue to but from them.  There GREAT!!!  All so nice.  Ask for Marty Stevens for sales and Mike for finace, Their both very good at their jobs.
Marty won't waste your time, tell him exactly what your looking for and he will do the work of looking for the right vehicle for you.  Than Mike will get you through finance in a record breaking time.  So if your time is valued to you go to Lodi CDJR. and get what you want.
Have a GREAT day!!!

Was planning on heading to Lodi Dodge this morning to trade-n my current Ram 2500 for a new one... But these reviews have me a bit scared... Hate giving other cities my tax dollars but sounds like not much of a choice... Hopefully Lodi Dodge will improve their customer service by the time I'm ready for my next truck...<//Review>

<Text>What can I say about this place. 2 words IT SUCKS. I was dealing with the internet fleet sales manager Marty Steve's. I saw an ad for the vehicle I wanted and asked Marty I want it for that price. Marty said yeah I can give it to you for that price but you have to come today. So I did and guess what Marty made false promises. I also waited there 5 hours to sign paperwork and Marty was jumping back and fourth customers and was being unprofessional about leaving me alone minutes at a time. He even told me go pick a vehicle within the price range of what I was looking for and he could work something out for me. I wasted my time. He didn't do squat for me. Absolutely nothing. All a sales tactic. People if you are reading other reviews it's true this place is horrible. Marty your customer service sucked. You asked me to write a good review for you but how can I? I'm not a liar like you. You lie for living and I get it but someday you will answer to someone right? Hope you feel good about it now. Anyways while waiting hours to see the finance manager all Marty talked about was his personal life how his wife left him and he barely sees his kid. I have a family to man and you guys really left me dry for a while before I got out of there. Oh and Marty you guys are not the cheapest in California for that Ram tradesman I bought just a another sales pitch lie though right? Maybe that's why your ex left you. Just saying. When i finally got with the finance manager my interest rate that we shook hands on Marty on a 3.5 percent didn't even happen but i shouldnt be surprised by another lie right Marty? Also the finance manager was pressuring me to buy extended warranty I mean so much pressure I almost said yes but thank God I said No! That Assyrian guy should be lucky i forgot his name or id be bashing you here to. You pressured me like 30 times to get extended warranty and you even mentioned that you could drop my interest rate if I were to get it. I did a lot of research you do know your tactics are illegal correct. Telling me my interest would get better with extended warranty is illegal that really should be a fireable offense. Oh by the way if your reading this review they add an additional 895 to your costs for the tracking of the vehicle. They will tell you it's included or a free service but it is NOT. Also they forgot to give my ID back to me. MARTY FORGOT IT IN THE COPIER. How unprofessional is that. I got lucky though he took it home with him but I still had to drive 20 miles to his house to pick it up lucky me but he also left the key tracker with me which I also returned to Marty. People if you are still reading my review don't do business with Marty he's been lieing to customers for 20 something years. I know he's been there 20 years cause all he did was brag about it. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. Seriously these people will do you wrong. Wish I wouldn't have jumped the gun but it is what it is I can only learn from it and let others know. Take your business elsewhere please.<//Text><response>None< /response><username>Jay Ram</username><userid>109270699048829913189< /userid>< GmapID>

In 2003, I bought my new Jeep Grand Cherokee from a different dealership on this lot.  I have only 56K miles on my Jeep to date.  I do a lot of my own service because of bad and poor experiences in the past.  The experience I have had at Lodi CDJR is one just as bad if not worse.  I originally took my Jeep in on 8/6/16 to have the air bag recall performed and to get an estimate for a check engine light.  (smog related).  For my jeep when it comes to smog issue, I want factory parts. Lodi CDJR furnishes a courtesy shuttle. (I need to rely on the courtesy vehicle because my Jeep is our only vehicle)  My Jeep was ready that day for pickup  (parts were ordered and I needed the vehicle ). I asked if the shuttle could pick me up. I was asked what time. I said 1 o'clock. They agreed.  I waited until 2:30 to call the dealer asking where my ride was. I was told they were just leaving.  I brought my Jeep in first thing Monday morning and got a ride home on the shuttle. At around 11:30 I was called saying my Jeep was ready.  I said I needed a ride. I was told they do not have anyone available at this time. They would call me when they did.  I waited until almost 3:30. I called the dealership back. I was told they just found someone that could get me. Then I waited another 45 minutes for the ride.  When I picked up my Jeep my front passenger door window was down about 4 inches and would not go up or down. Ended up being a repair I would have to do. They would not repair unless I paid to have it repaired.  All the windows were up when I left my vehicle that morning. My thought  is someone slammed the door that broke the cable on the regulator. The next day I tried no less than 6 times to call Robert, the service manager, who was always busy or not in. The operator told me I needed to leave  him a voice mail with my name and number and he would call me back. I left Robert  a voice mail with my name and number on 8/9/16 . I AM STILL WAITING AND IT IS MONDAY THE 15TH. Robert don't waste my time now with a phone call. My Jeep is a 2003 with low miles and very clean, at no time during any of the work being done was my seat covered with plastic to protect the vehicle seat from the dirty clothes of the mechanics.  My Jeep now gets 13.7 miles per gallon, it was getting 18.2 miles per gallon before they worked on it.  I will never buy, recommend or have any work done on any of my vehicles at Lodi CDJR.  I was thinking of buying a new Grand Cherokee Jeep and pass this one to one of my grand kids. If I do it will not be from this dealership.
For the mileage problem I found the cover from the air cleaner to the top of the fuel injection installed wrong. I reinstalled the cover and retrained the computer and now I have my good mileage back.  It is really to bad when the customer has to repair what the professionals work on. My personal recommendation use caution and think twice before dealing with Lodi CDJR.<//Text>

Andy is the worst sales person on the planet. He will lie to you and waste your time. Go to any other dealership if possible. If you go here to purchase a vehicle you will have the a terrible experience. This piece of crap had me bring my wife and two year old to the dealership after he lied to my face.< /Review>

(1) your service department, charged me more than my $100 00 repair deductible, approved by my insurance company.

(2) your finance department did not disclose a complete purchase order, price amount to my Credit Union, for the purchase price on the 2018 Dodge, 350 pickup I was trying to buy.

(3) Your finance manager/Department caused (3) Credit report hits that has now damage my credit score..... I was told there would be only (1) hit....<//text>

Customer service is horrible. Paid $160 for them to tell me exactly the same thing i told them was wrong with my car. Then took it to another shop and they said the part they wanted to replace was ok and didnt need replacing. Almost cost me $2300.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I do not like this place for the reason that to convince you they speak beautifully to you but once they sell you the car and they are no longer responsible if it is defective first or if in a few words they do not care they sell and now. The truth is that they do not fit the truth, I do not recommend because I am sorry to buy a truck from that place, now they made me feel like a fraud, I am not going to take care of me, do not happen the same

(Original)
Ese lugar no me gusta por la razón de que para convencerte te hablan bonito pero una vez que ya te venden el automóvil y ya no se asen  responsable si es defectuoso de primero o si en pocas palabra no les importa ellos venden y ya. no entran razón a nada  la verdad yo no recomiendo porque  yo estoy arrepentido de comprar una troca de ese lugar ahora me isieron sentir  como un fraude   voy nadien me ase caso cuidado no pasen lo mismo</review>< Pictures>
