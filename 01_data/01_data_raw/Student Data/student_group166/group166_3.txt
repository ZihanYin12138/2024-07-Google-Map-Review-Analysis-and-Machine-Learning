< review>
This place has been the vet for my parents pets 30+ years. I've grown up and become a vet myself practicing in another state.  I had an incident while visiting my parents where my puppy ate poison berries in the backyard and Pleasanton Vet was able to squeeze him in to what I'm sure was a full schedule and able to induce vomiting and get the berries back up. This practice has always come through when we have needed them. Excellent place to take your pet.</review>

Love bringing my golden retriever clutch here. They are very professional and when treating him they break it all down on what they are giving him and cost per and total. Allowing me to make informed decisions. Highly recommend Dr. Shapiro for your pets</Review>

It is not straight forward and someone in the know really helps and for this I am incredibly grateful.< /Review>< user_id>

Had my first appointment here on Monday at 8:30am. They were prompt and took Murphy in as soon as I arrived. Dr. Shapiro was very patient and took the time to answer all of my questions. I'm very happy to have found a veterinary hospital I feel really good about taking Murphy too.<//review>

A big special thanks to Cynthia  for always bringing a smile to my face and a sense comfort to Hāna while she stayed there as well as being able to accommodate me in such short notice.

My wife Kendall and I took our cat here to be checked out. She keeps scratching her ear and we don't know why (and still don't know why). Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital, without actually seeing our cat prescribed a variety of medications and put her on a diet trial for 3 months and insisted she be in a cone for that duration of time. When asked to bring our cat in, they refused to examine our cat, claiming she was swiping at them, even though they also said they never took her out of the cat carrier to begin with (there was no way she could have gotten her paw through the holes in the cat carrier). They prescribed Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant medication claiming this would stop her from swiping at them in future visits and were gracious enough to charge us for it. Our cat was calm and fine going to and from the vet and is by nature and extremely friendly cat who sits in peoples laps when she meets them and we have never had this kind of issue with any other vet. We gave our cat this medication as prescribed, as well as daily dosages of Prednisolone (a steroid) and an anxiety medication and brought her back to the vet. They said she was still swiping at them (still having never taken her out of the cat carrier) and refused to examine our cat, told us to keep our cat in a cone and keep her on a diet trial for another 3 months while charging us for these visits and still having not examined or cat to see if this is even warranted. They graciously charged us for an examination both times without examining our cat and without providing any possible solutions other than long term medication, change of diet and continuous wearing of a cone. When told we would be soliciting a second opinion, they were very quick to give us our cat back without any pleasantries. I do not recommend this vet.< /Text>

<review>I went to a 24 hour veterinary hospital in Dublin, CA, for a year. I left when my "Rosita" was taken from me by a heartless, nonchalant, rude, non empathetic human being.
I thought I would never own another dog. Rosita's death shattered most of my heart. She was my "Emotional Support Therapy" dog and she loved me as much as I loved her.
After a few months of crying, sleeping and isolation, I decided to look online at the animal shelter in Dublin.
I was scanning pictures of the potential adoptees and my finger stopped. There she was, this cute, little imp of a face, with ears laid back. That was it!! She was staring back at me, with tiny, black eyes, yearning for her "forever" home.
I immediately called the shelter and asked if this sweet precious was still available for adoption. She was!!!
I jumped out of bed, got dressed and was there, faster than "greased lightening"!!
I was waiting in the yard, and one of the attendants opened the door. There she was, running on her leash like a banshee.
I picked her up and she curled up in my lap. I was a goner for this sweet girl. Turned out, she's a "Senior", just like me, with two, rather large, bald spots and a few, rotten teeth.
She received a vet check and I was told she is a "Chinese Crested" and ??? else.
It really was "love at first sight"!!!
I was on the hunt for a new doctor for "Miss Molly". We both decided that "Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital" would be our medical, grooming, nutritional facility.
The administrative employees, vet techs and veterinarians are ALL caring, knowledgeable, empathetic and kind. We've ALWAYS been treated like family and Miss Molly is always calm and collected, when we are there.
We are both very happy to recommend "Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital" for your animals' medical, grooming and nutritional needs.< /review>< Pics>

I've been going here since 2005. The staff is great and have become family! They know how to work with different types (protection, etc.) of dogs. If you are looking for a vet in the Tri-Valley, I would highly recommend Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital, based on price, quality of service and professionalism.</Text>

<review>they’re super great with birds (i’m unsure about dogs because i don’t have one but i’m sure they’re awesome with them as well.) i bring my cockatiel here and she’s handled well each time. she had an eye infection and they took her in that next morning, flushed her eye out, talked me through it, gave me eye drops for her, and now she’s good as new within a day. Dr. Edelman cares about the animals brought in and does a good job giving information on what foods, care, and other things birds need in their lives. she has always been eager to help and educate me. will be going here forever for my bird.<//review>< Rating>

< Review>
Took my fractious cat in for an exam. By the end of the whole thing (despite giving them ample warning), I was told not to bring him back. I was also told not to bother getting his vaccinations moving forward because he is so difficult to handle. We went to the SPCA following this appointment and they managed just fine.

DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE. They only care for easy animals. Not challenging rescues. ZERO compassion.<//Review>

<text>I love Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital!  The staff is always so nice and they try to accommodate whenever possible.  I feel that the doctors give me the straight answers, and options for what may need to be done now, and possibly in the future, and I always get a sincere, caring feeling from them when they are interacting with my dog.  I'd recommend them to everyone!< /text>< pics>

Our small dog, a Bichon Havanese, has received care from the people at Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital for all of his now nearly 15 years. From routine things like microchip and inoculation, more (ahem) life changing things like neutering, occasional emergencies like his sprained neck, to the tooth cleaning and extraction of his more senior years, we have always appreciated the kindness and care of the people there.<//Review>

This place is awesome! Dr. E is amazing with my dogs, he really takes the time to make them feel comfortable and show them some love before anything else. He explains everything so thoroughly and doesn't make you feel rushed. The other vets here are great as well, I just can't remember their names, but they have seen my animals, too. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a vet in the tri-valley.< /Text>

<Text>This hospital preformed several extractions and blood tests, follow up appointments...and somehow missed that my cat wasn't healing. The underlying cause (which they should have caught) caused his death and their negligence caused him additional pain. Please don't make the same mistake I did by taking your fur baby to this facility.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
If only all businesses had such nice people! Here it is affordable and the service is very caring. I was so frustrated with other vets I dealt with in South San Jose and Palo Alto. The other vets had no empathy and they wanted to charge an arm and a leg, pushing for same day surgery of the wrong limb, and not answering my questions stating that they will answer it next time or the next specialist will answer the questions. With the care I've had so far here, I do not regret the 1 hr drive. Pleasanton Veterinary Hospital has called back to answer questions and followup on concerns regarding the surgery. I will recommend this vet hospital 100% to anyone I know. So far so very worth it!!!<//review>

<Text>The chiropractor actually looked at my chart from the past and wanted to sit down and discuss matters so that he would know what to do and how to do it to alleviate my pain for my lower back. He did such a good job at adjusting my back that I have no pain afterwards. This chiropractor only works Friday and Saturdays and I will be going back every Friday or Saturday every month.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I have used The Joint offices, across the USA. As I travel for work. I drove 250 miles today for a treatment from your Dr. BAKER.
He has a special touch, to adjust my L5.
I am very happy with all of your personnel
In every office that I have used in the last 3 years.

Thank you

Dr. Greg DeLaMare is GREAT! I have chronic issues - neck and upper back issues, torn rotator cuff shoulder injury from the past, chronic migraines/headaches. Every session he significantly helps me! Also, gives me advice on what I can do at home or at work to help me maintain my body healthier. Highly recommend. I have felt much much better since coming and being treated by Dr. Greg DeLaMare.<//text>

They switch chiropractors too often which im not a fan of and they got me to commit to the membership and forgot to tell me about their cancelation policy. I went once a month and still got charged for 4 times...go somewhere else<//review>

Check in and registration were simple and painless.  Chiropractor is great.  very thorough in his discussion about symptoms and how I was feeling. What my concerns were.  Administration of treatment is excellent ,  I feel much better after only 2 visits.  The facility on El Toro road Lake Forest is clean, pleasant, welcoming and on the 2 occasions I went in quiet so I was treated almost immediately on arrival.  I would highly recommend  a visit.<//Text>

Dr. Greg was very helpful to me. He listened to my concerns and observations,  then formulated his plan for adjustments.  I left the office with marked relief from pain.  My thanks to The Joint for providing effective chiropractic service in such an accessible format.</text>

The doctors here are amazing. I personally like Dr Greg. The front desk gals are always warm and welcoming. It's great being able to go and get adjusted 7 days a week. Their times work great with the normal 9-5 job most have. Affordable chiropractic care you keep you in good health.</review>

Great service without having to schedule  an appointment.

I am an active athlete outside of my desk job, and my body needs constant realignment, adjustments, pain relief in general.   The joint has been amazing !
My lower back pain has reduced significantly by going to my weekly sessions.   The sessions are fast, and convenient. I’m in and out in 10-15 minutes .
If your looking for effective body maintenance , that is efficient , and affordable ,  this is the place !<//review>

DayLene at the reception was very friendly and helpful during my visits. Dr. Greg is also great. During my first visit, Dr. Greg spent a fair amount of time in consultation and adjustment and did a great job. The second time I visited the adjustments felt a little more rushed and not as thorough as the first time. I would have appreciated a little more time spent on my second visit for a more thorough adjustment.<//text>

<text>Update:  Dr. Greg DeLaMare and DayLene are just amazing.  I got their names wrong up front but now I know them and wanted to make that correction.  I’ve gotten such a return to movement that I just didn’t dare to expect and I couldn’t be happier.  Always friendly and spot on for treatment.  Plus this model is super convenient for my crazy work life!  Thanks again to my caring care givers!!!!

———————————————
Having never been exposed to this business model for chiropractic care, I didn’t know what to expect but when a coworker recommended this to me I was in such discomfort I was willing to give it a shot and they accept walk-ins!
When I arrived, I was greeted professionally by Julie at the front desk who shared some detail around the membership and the option of a single adjustment, which is what I thought I wanted so I was offered a seat in the nicely decorated and comfortable lobby.  It was only a couple of minutes before it was my turn and Dr. Gary did not disappoint.  This guy has some serious skills!  I was so impressed I signed up as the cancellation policy leaves no risk and only reward.
Today was the first visit where Dr,
Gary wasn’t there and I was skeptical but left beyond delighted as I had a new issue area.  I didn’t catch his name but was treated with a different and super effective style and have eagerly opted to stay enrolled in the program.
The friendly informative and efficient Julie as the face of the business and the highly skilled chiropractic treatment I experienced without the hassle of appointments and insurance all combine to make this the ideal treatment plan for my schedule and my chronic back issues.
I highly recommend this business and can’t praise the folks at the Lake Forest location enough.  Thank you team for delivering the highest level of care exactly how I need it to be!</text><Time>1573612045404< /Time><username>Pennie Rosin-Borrousch<//username><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Dr. DeLaMare is a miracle worker. He's got a gift, and I am so fortunate to have found him! He is a good listener, gentle, and his adjustments work! I am definitely feeling so much better and can't thank him enough! Also, when you check-in, Daylene is so nice and explains how everything works. She makes it so easy to understand membership details, and helps you instantly feel welcome. If you are interested in feeling better, don't hesitate to try it out. I look forward to each visit because I know I'm going to feel so much better!</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Man, where to start, last week I came in with really serious pain in my back and ribs from golfing. After being adjusted twice(Tuesday/Wednesday) I was able to go to work that Thursday feeling a lot better, so much so that I thought I could start swinging my clubs again, that was the BIGGEST mistake of my life, I should’ve let my back rest for awhile, but we all want things to be immediate sometimes. Needless to say after a couple swings I nearly collapsed in pain and went straight home barely being able to breathe and now with a pain I’d never felt before in my life. It literally felt like somebody took a knife and put it between my shoulder blades and just start twisting away. So I called out of work Friday and went to a different chiropractor in Huntington Beach because they opened at 5:30am and I needed to be seen right away. Got adjusted twice there and had some relief, the funny thing was that I mentioned to them I had been to the Joint and they kind of shamed me like I shouldn’t ever do that, almost as if to say The Joint is a joke. Well, I went home that night and I couldn’t sleep because the pain and the following night it got out of control.  By the time I got up Sunday morning my entire back was locking up and spasming. My ribs and back hurt so bad I called my dad to come home from church to take me to the hospital. I knew I wouldn’t go to the hospital I just needed somebody to talk me through the pain. We went to The Joint once again in so much pain basically hopeless at this point. Doctor Greg adjusted me as my body began to shake, not from being cold, but from the sheer amount of pain I was in. After “surviving the adjustment” I had immediate relief, no more spasming, no more shaking in pain, but a pain that I could manage. I went home and laid on a heating pad the rest of the day and essentially all day Monday. The amount of relief was astronomical. Now it’s Thursday and I’ve been working all week without much pain, obviously the muscles are sore from the spasming and what not, but I’m back on my feet. I just got adjusted again and it felt great, I know Greg saved me from having to go to the hospital and potentially taking pain meds that never really heal anything, they just mask the pain. The strange thing is that this Chiro in Huntington(that shamed me for going to the joint) charges like $60 a visit and I had less success from their treatment then the simple, quick and easy $15 it cost per visit at The Joint. Thank you so much, I’m going to continue resting my back for awhile as the muscles are still sore, but I know I will be better soon thanks to you guys. Hopefully this turns someone away from getting huge hospital bills and pain meds that don’t help. God bless, from Thomas.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce8f9f7e248c5:0xdffdf7236e7aa1c1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had bad lower back pain when I walked in, and when I left it was gone. That’s the best part. But from my experience the guy who adjusted me was very aggressive. I’m used to people telling me to take a deep breath or ease into it. With time his adjustment I felt as if someone had made him mad right before I walked in. He did the job but it was an uncomfortable process<//Review>

Dr. Greg DeLaMare is a wonderful go to. Just snuck in at closing time ( 7pm) tonight and he spend all of 5-10 minutes putting me back in line and loosening up my tight back. There's no words to the value of taking pain away in just minutes and being consistent and highly valuable. You've got a highly experienced Doctor here...seeking an easier life than owning a full practice. So you get $300 an hour or more for "The Joint" prices. Seriously...you are NOT gonna get this service at all inexpensive membership places. Sunday through Thursday...Lake Forest Joint for your back, life and stress!  I'm a BIG fan...< /text>

<Text>I went in with a lot of pain. And when out feeling like Brad new.
On my third visit i was told that there
Was a problem. Excruciating pain
Turns out i have lumbar muscle strain!
Tho i already had this problem,
Before going to the chiropractor
I was referred to get a xray
Before any further damage to
My back.
Truly  caring staff
I think they are the best!
Slow road to recovery!
Back pain not fun<//Text>< Pics>

Dr. DeLaMare was brilliant. Love this spot! I have suffered soreness in my left leg, they do a great job at diagnosing why and then fixing the issue. 6 stars! Also despite the amount of documents I had to sign, Dalene organized them into one packet for me and made it teal easy.<//text>

I have been in chronic pain for the last two months after my first visit I was relieved by 30 % of the pain in my back. I cannot say enough good things about the doctors and the staff here they are all kind,Welcoming ,knowledgeable And beyond wonderful with my children. After coming here I have even decided to have each of my children adjusted and it was one of the best decisions ever. I highly recommend if you have children to also get them adjusted during my visit it was shared with me how important routine adjustments even for children are to help them while they are growing to stay aligned. I’m sure like most people when they hear chiropractic care they think a very expensive visit, But coming here that is further from the truth! They make it beyond affordable even for those of us on a tight budget! So if you’re like me and you read the reviews before going anywhere I highly highly recommend that you try the joint at least once you won’t regret it ! Dr Greg is awesome 😎</Review>

I dislocated my ribs over a week ago. Physical Therapy was going to cost me way to much a visit with my Insurance. A friend recommended me to visit this place to see if they could help. So far I have been back twice. My ribs are still dislocated however, with the adjustments I am getting the pain is slowly going away. Continuing with the exercises I received from my doctor I am sure they will be in in no time.</text>

Chiropractor was very personable and professional.  He understood what was wrong and did the right steps to ease my pain to almost nothing, for the first time in a few weeks.<//Text>

Dr. DeLaMare is a great doctor he knows exactly how to adjust where i need it. Daylene is always friendly and easy to talk to about how chiropractic care can help with my troublesome areas on my back an neck. I have been going there for awhile now and I can see an feel a huge difference from when I first started going there an now. I feel more energized and lose no more pain in my lower back above my hips. My partner has been going there to and I see a huge difference with him too and how he is feeling after getting adjusted.  The pricing isn’t bad either very affordable and it really does help so your not spending to much money just going in when you need it and what the Doctor recommendation is for you and your care. I highly recommend this place even if you haven’t ever had chiropractic care before the Doctor definitely works with you one on one and recommends what is best for you so you can feel better. I would definitely say keep going after your first time over time it does help you out a lot and helps your spine a lot too. Daylene and Dr. DeLaMare are a great team and are so kind an caring to everyone that walks through that door.< /text>

< review>
Dr. LaMare is a lifesaver! At least once per week my arthritis and stenosis flares to the point of agonizing tension and pain; and once per week I go see Dr. LaMare. He is gentle, yet utilizes the right amount of pressure and force to manipulate the joints so the muscles can relax. I live 40 miles away, and make a special trip each week to see Dr. LaMare. His office is never full but always busy. All the patients I have spoken to love Dr. LaMare and sing his accolades.
On another note, Dr. LaMare is friendly, polite and always helpful.< /review>

Dr. DeLamare helps me to walk upright and back to weight training again.  The miracle is not to walk on water but to walk pain free!  This is The Joint.</review>

Dr & staff exellent. Well worth the effort.  Dr. Gregg is great and Dalene.  I liked Dr. Nori.  I hope that you get someone good for Fridays. The Saturday doctor is better for very fragile patients.  In the old age community I guess he is good. They are all nice and that is critical.<//review>

<Review>I went to hospital because I had very severe pain at my lower back and I could not walk and I could not move at any directions. Hospital did nothing and gave me painkiller, but painkiller did not work neither. I came to this place and in less than 3 minutes only one adjustment I could walk and move my body immediately. I was so amazed by that. My pain from 10 of 10 dropped to almost 3 and could breath. I am very thankful for the help I did receive from the doctor. His name was Dr. Flodius. He had accent but he explained the cause and effect of my case. Thank you for the help.

I am a Massage Therapist and my body is constantly working. I have also been in a very bad car accident, as a pedestrian, a year ago and still suffer from aches and pains in my low back and hips. Dr. Oliveri is great at what she does and has never pushed me to do more than I was comfortable with. I have been to other chiropractors and was nervous about her adjusting my neck but now I feel comfortable enough to let her adjust it. I have been coming here since it has opened and have never had any problems. The front desk associates are especially wonderful and friendly. Everytime I walk in I feel like a friend and not like just another client/number.<//text>

Will NOT return here. Sign out front says $29 adjustment and was charged $39. Girl at the counter says its because that is only for initial visit. This was my first time coming to this location. I have been to the Laguna Niguel location but I know they are seperate owners. Girl at the front counter was rude and only replied "I didnt make the sign" when I asked. I asked for a printed receipt as my wife is a bookkeeper and was then told the printer didnt work. The person who did my adjustment did not ask any questions as to if I was having pain or why I was there for an adjustment. He really didnt speak to me at all nor did he address my concerns. I will say that my experience was much less than satisfactory and it was complete opposite of how the Laguna Niguel office treated me. As well they perform the adjustment for the $29 rate as advertised. Stay clear of this location< /text>

Continued to charge a card I did not authorize them to use for 6 months nor did I use their service during the same period. I did not receive a call, email, etc. in regards to my absence but had no problem charging me for a service I was not using. My bank stated they contacted them for an additional card to charge so they could "keep providing their services". Watch your accounts when discontinuing the service, they are not an upfront business about their policies.< /Text>

<Review>Super cool spot for lunch hidden away in a large shopping center corner in Ladera Ranch. The make your own pizza restaurant prices are a great bargain at 8.99 for a pizza. The menu items of pre built pizzas sound super delicious too. I ordered a number 9, which contains ham, bacon, red sauce, pineapple and cilantro. My pizza was very good and contained a good amount of toppings. The place is nice and clean. A must visit for lunch or dinner.< /Review></record>

<review>The prices here for building your own pie are honestly really good. It’s a lot cheaper than many of the other artisan build your own pizza spots around town. Great selection of ingredients that are always fresh! The cooks know the exact right amount of time to keep your pizza in the oven so that it cooked to a golden brown perfection where there isn’t too much crunch or too much dough.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrDSB0pwiZysapkoE6APa_M9lp-Yi3t9JKN5d7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxmcP_9wQsE9QcsvyM7Zq8rsbQ0DbLFvbQfae8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>The pizza here is always fantastic, nice thin crust, the ingredients are really fresh, and the service is fast and friendly. I come here for a quick lunch all the time on lunch breaks - the lunch special is only $6.99 for a pizza and drink!! Definitely one of the the best "make your own" pizza places.< /Text>< Pics>

We love project pie!  Our kids are adventurous with the toppings they choose.   We all really enjoy it.  Fast, good service,  good beers on tap as well.   Their club you can opt into also often sends great deals.<//review>

This is okay. It seems exactly like other quick pizza places. It was not busy for lunch on a weekday. The employees were easily confused when our group ordered several pizzas and salads. The salads are fine and the pizza is good for what it is trying to be. The value and timing make it a good lunch spot.</text>

Pretty good deal with the coupon we used for three pizzas and two drinks the pizzas are small in comparison to a standard pizza shop but it's kind of fun building your own pizza and it was quite tasty..<//review>

<Text>Project Pie is definitely the best place for pizza in Ladera! Their staff here is awesome & quick, the food is delicious and it’s kept super clean which I love. The overall experience is always great and the kids think it’s cool & fun they get to customize their own pizza.</Text>< Pictures>

It's good and I'll certainly be going back.

Parking can be a bit obnoxious. It's also a bit too crowded and loud for my tastes.</Review>

Good pizza, really bad service. I stood at  the counter for five minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge me. Only to find out they never entered the phone order I placed 15 minutes earlier. No apology, and seemed generally annoyed to have to deal with it.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It's nice to be able to eat such a fresh pizza in the US. You can choose endless toppings for less than $ 10!

(Original)
미국에서 이런 신선한 피자를 먹을수 있다니 좋네요.10불도 안되는가격에 원하는 토핑을 무한으로 선택할수도 있구요!<//review>

<Text>I have been a client of Enrich Financial for the last 3 years, and the reason i've been with them this long is not because my case is not getting complete but because i keep contacting them for different services. First they repaired my credit, and did it in a matter of a couple of months. Then i contacted them to help me build my credit and i have had amazing results. They have helped me out with my personal credit as well as were able to help out with some business funding as well. Thanks to them i was able to purchase the car i've always wanted and haven't been denied for any credit i've applied for. The specialist that always takes care of my account is Marina at the Glendale office, and so far i have been a very happy client. Overall the Glendale team is great and i'm always happy with the services i receive. Thank you ladies!</Text><Name>Tigran Shahmuradyan<//Name><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

If you have late payments or collections in past from your student loans, Enrich is really good at removing it off your credit report. I highly recommend them. They have a lot of experience and knowledge in this field.</text>

Simply the best.  Back in January 2021 I tried to get a car loan and was denied cause of my bad credit history. Enrich financial helped me get my credit score up and recently I was approved for a car loan. Highly Recommend!</Review>

If i could put 0 star for this company i would. This company is a scam, stay away from them. Don’t be fool by positive review that their own staff and friend left for them.
They charged you their fees on your credit card but they don’t do the job. Please read the reviews and do not let them take your money, it is a SCAM.< /Text>

We started with them in Feb 2016, and I got some items deleted within 30 to 45 days as they said would happen.  Unfortunately I lost my job, so I had to call up to cancel my services.  Upon speaking to The President of the company, Arian, he informed me that he was going to help us for an additional 6 months at no cost to us! We've gone through other Credit Repair companies and no other companies cared like this company.</text></record>

I have been with Enrich Financial for about 16 months now, and i am satisfied with their service for my credit cards settlement and repair.

I want to especially thank “Mrs. Sheri” for her professional attitude as well as being helpful at all the times. She replied all my questions/concerns in details and patient. Also, she did follow up my case constantly.

I will give more feedback when my case is totally done hopefully in near future :)<//Text>

I'm surprised this company is still in business after defrauding so many people, including myself. I'm ashamed of admitting that even after reading the bad reviews I still got scammed by them. Farzad with his lies and smooth talk got me into believing that they know what they are doing, but sadly, it is all a game to them. Your money is how they are paying for advertising their fake services and defrauding more people so do yourself and others a favor and don't feed into this scam.
I have to admin that they are great at making you feel like they are following up with you, and that's all that is. Bunch of girls sitting on a computer and calling clients to waste their time and when you ask for result they will show you a thread of emails that they sent out just to rack up emails and follow ups. To try to make you feel it's your fault that they didn't do their job.< /Text>

What could have been a stressful process was delightful with Arian and team.

one of my family members told me about this company how they fixed his credit and did a settlement for her. Took their number and gave it a call, explained my situation to them and they took care of my credit and boosted my credit score, now I have that big smile on that I can go to any dealership and get a brand new car. lets not forget that good score can give you a better negotiation. what I learned is that credit is a big part of your financial and you need a good  credit anywhere, I recommend everyone that want a good credit is to go to this company and be satisfied of how organized and professional they are. THANK YOU ENRICH<//Text>

All of the negative points on my credit were eventually removed. Thank you to Mr. Eghbali and Ms. Naze and their team. One word of advice I have is that depending on your individual credit case, the estimated time of completion will vary; sometimes it may take years rather than months to resolve a complex issue like mine was. But one thing that is certain is that they will get the job done, and will stay with you throughout the process. I received a total of almost 200 letters from the beginning to the end which were initiated by Ms. Naze's team, which I forwarded one-by-one as they arrived to Mr. Eghbali's office, showing just how much the team continues to communicate with credit companies.< /text>

Stay away, far far away, these people are scammers and criminals. They are defrauding their clients and they think they can getaway with that. But I can rest assure that I will not rest until every single person they scammed is paid pack in full. Message me if you were also defrauded by them. And know that attorney general is looking for companies like them such as debt relief companies, credit repairs and student loan relief.</review>

I had collections, and so many late payments and low limit cards. They fixed my credit in 8 months. All negatives, late payments, collections were removed and they got me credit cards with high limits. They gave me financial plan teaching how to use my credit to maintain a good credit score.</review><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>114697003035247951373<//UserId.>< Time>

<text>When we talk about improving our credit score or when we try to find the best way to get rid of our bad debts, bankruptcies, accounts in collection, late payments fees and ... we must trust someone who knows every single detail about financing. It is not just about the knowledge but the successful experiences with thousands of clients who thought never can fix their credit problems.

I am really thankful with just one call, they handled my credit and the good thing about them is that they keep you updated. Very professional. thank you guys for your help! highly recommended and even tho, they give away $500 to the winner of a lottery that is going on their instagram page every week !! and lets not forget that they are still OPEN, give them a call!!!</text>

<Text>They did a great job. At first I was concerned because I had no results.  I called my case manager, she explained that sometimes the process takes longer than expected.  Since they were responsive each time I spoke to  them, I decided to be patient.  Then I started to results all at once.  My score went from 550 to 700 within 90 days!  Just got approved for my mortgage and I'm so happy to find them.</Text>< Pics>

Hear a lot of about this company and saw the advertisements everywhere. Since I did have a bad credit decided to check this credit repair company out. They gave me free consultation and I decided to do business with him. it's been 7 months now and they fixed and boosted up my credit. My credit is on a very good shape right now and I am amazed by their job. they are really really good at what they r doing. talk to them. CREDIT IS IMPORTANT.<//text>

I want to start of how amazing Arian Eghbalis Agents are, very professional and very responsive. they always followed up with me. one thing with them is that if you want to get help for credit, loans or even I heard that they remove Bankruptcy, go with Enrich. they helped me out removing my negatives within a month and my credit jumped high. I am writing this review to appreciate of what they have done an amazing job to get my credit fix and my score is over 800 right now. I am a really happy and looking forward to work with them more ion future if I need help.....FIVE STARS

Thank you Enrich<//Review>

Best office of credit repair. They built my credit while I did not have any credit score. They helped me to get credit cards and increase my credit score and my credit card limits. If you moved to america recently and you have NO idea about credit I would highly suggest you to hire this firm and get help from them.<//review>

<text>I was struggling with my Banktrubcey until one of my close friends told me that there is a company that they fix credits and just go talk to them. well, I contacted them and told my situation to one of the best specialists and he gave me the negatives I had on my report. after a short period of time, my case is done and I have 0 negatives plus my Bankruptcy is not showing on my report anymore. I just wanted to leave a yelp review so people with the same situation as me can see that there is a company by Mr. Eghbali that his team will help you out to get rid of your negatives and get your credit boosted and have better credit. I am so happy and glad that I met them and they handled my credit very well. thank you guys for all your help. plus before I forget they always notified and kept me updated with the results. very very organized thank you guys again. number one credit company</text>< date>

I am very happy with my case, since my case was started with Enrich Financial they helped me step by step until all the negative issues was removed, professional team members with enough knowledge, great office staff who treat clients with care and helpfulness, special thanks to “Amir” from customer service for all his follow ups and answering my questions and concerns until the case was done, highly recommended to everyone.</Text>

Enrich financial was able to get my credit score up and delete my collections and take out all inquiries . Niloofar was my rep and she did such a great Job. She was following up with me all the time and was on top of my case . I’m a busy person so following up is extremely important . I would like to thank Niloofar and staff for their hard work and dedication !< /Text>

Credit repair specialist at Enrich Financial and his team answered all my questions whenever I emailed them, they are amazing! I would recommend him to anyone that needs help with their credit! Enrich Financial has been extremely helpful. I continue to work with them when it comes to getting advice on credit. So I googled these companies in my area, and found that Enrich Financial and Credit repair specialist had surprisingly great reviews. I'm so happy for the help they rendered to me.</text>

i was a victim of identity theft and i've been trying to buy a house for 4 years and nobody could help me out. Arian and the enrich team really pulled through for me. Within 8 months they cleared my credit report and cleaned it up. My credit score went from 545 to 740 and i'm currently in escrow. Can’t thank you guys enough !!<//Review>

I had a great experience at Enrich Financial in repairing my credit. I appreciate all the hard work and the individualized attention I got . They were true professionals .

I was looking into some ways of fixing my credit. I wasn't sure where to start or begin..They were very thorough with my results letting me know the best ways to go about on each problem to help raise my credit.! Enrich is the definition of professionalism  .It is imperative that Enrich is your first choice in credit repair.

Do not hesitate to check them out! With such great customer service from not even being a customer, I'm sure they can help you even more.</Text>

Tara is a STAR. She does what she says. This is a credible company to whom I am happy paying for their services knowing they will deliver.

Short & Simple here is my Story :

June 20th 2019 - Score 541
Aug 25th 2019.  - Score 753 Increase of 212 points.

Go Beat that.

Thank you very much team and all involved .

“YOU ALL HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE”

Can’t thank you all enough .

I was under extreme stress and Tara and her amazing work ethics got me through STEP By STEP.

Last word:

Listen to what Tara is saying and do what Tara is saying IF you want to get what Tara is saying.<//Review>

PLEASE PLEASE read all the reviews or  talk to the actual people before sign the contract with them. They literally bribed me and 2 of my other friends to leave a "5 star" review. They pay people to write a good review. This is  beyond sad. They screwed up my case, took all my money and not answering my phone/emails. NEVER Seen such a terrible customer service here is the US. I'm beyond shocked and already filed a complaint against them.< /review>

<text>I'm spending my time to write this to save your money. This "negotiation" they claim they can do with your cc companies is nothing that you can't do yourself. I faced some difficulties paying for my credit cards, so seeing their advertisements everywhere, I decided to contact them to get help. They said they would negotiate with my cc companies to settle them down to one third. I paid them $900 as a deposit and was supposed to wait for 3 months until they can start the negotiation. One month after, I decided to cancel my contract with them because even if they could reduce the balances to one third, I was still unable to payoff the remaining balance. They conveniently said they wouldn't refund my money to cover their costs!!! Like, other than a few papers that were printed and less than an hour of consultation, what other costs did they have? I never understood. The funny thing; however, was the fact that my cc companies started offering me a settlement amount that was 19% of the entire balance I owed them. If you're reading this, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money by hiring them. The settlement is going to happen automatically. You don't need them for that. You're already in financial crisis and all they would do for you is to put you in more trouble.

I now know where they get all those advertisements funded from... Don't let them rip you off.<//text><Date>1522830318030</Date><resp>None</resp>< Name>

I was looking around for a good company to settle my credit and I came across Enrich financial and decided to give them my case because of all the good reviews. I am so happy about my decision. I had 3 bad accounts on my credits. Arian Eghbali and his team removed them all. Thanks. My score went up from 540 to 710 !! . They are professionals and know how to handle your case. I absolutely recommend them. Thank you Arian Eghbali and Credit Repair Specialist<//Text>

This is one of the few companies for which I am writing a review. Thanks to the team for being so helpful throughout. It is due to their services that I was able to fix up my credit report in a short span of time.  It is worth the time and money.</review>

if i could give them 0 i would.
Worst credit repair agency ever!!! They appear to want to help you but in reality they just want your money. All their promises are empty words with no results at all. Stay away from them; don't trust their well played "good customer service" with fake smiles. They will never improve your credit or even return your calls for that matter to answer your questions. The worst experience we had!!!< /Review>

<text>They will promise you a lot and they won't deliver. 3.5 years ago they promised to fix our credit since we were behind on our mortgage. They promised 4 months it would be fixed. After 2 years of no results, paying them $5000 and got $1400 back for our troubles. The owner, Arian Eghbali, wouldn't even meet with us and explain. He stole from us. I wanted to take him to court but I couldn't, I didn't have time.  Don't believe this company is going to help you. They aren't and they can not do anything. They will just string you along until you give up and lose everything. I keep seeing all the advertising for this company and we know they didn't help us. We don't anyone to waste their money and time.
I wasn't going to review them, but, I can't see all the advertising and not say something. This is an honest review, not any competition.<//text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

I highly recommend that if anyone has a need to clean up their credit, they will choose Enrich Financial.  Arian and his team of professionals will sit down and walk you through the process.  After going over your credit report, they will suggest ways to make it better.  It is very important to know where your credit stands.  Don't let someone else determine your ranking, improve it yourself and move forward.  Very good customer service!</Review>

Total fraud! Wasted two years with zero work done! It took me 9 months to get a unfair refund of only $500 on $1500 contract when they didn’t delete ANYTHING from my reports! Don’t waste your time and money with these guys! Do yourself a favor and find something more reliable!< /Review>

I contacted Enrich Financial Credit Repair services and immediately spoke with a very knowledgeable person.  I told them about my credit problems. They provided me a simple process that helped me fix my bad credit quickly and they also showed me how to improve my credit scores with all of the bureaus. They have a group of experienced team of advisers and contractors to help correct any type of credit related problem. It was fast and easy. I spoke with a man named Arian, who was of great help. He gave me a detailed explanation of how to proceed or what needed to be done. They have 100% satisfaction clause to erase any credit related problems. They helped me so much that there was no need to pay any extra money to any other credit repair company.
I would recommend this service to anyone!<//Review>

<Review>Their credit repair is a TOTAL SCAM! I just needed a couple of late payments cleaned. FOR 3 YEARS they gave me the run-around. The late payments kept re-appearing on my credit. They don't guarantee anything and I didn't get my money back. Once they have your money you don't hear from them again!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1554293104839</Time><rate>1< /rate><Review>Awful company and also people are working in it, all of them are big LIER, never trust them even 1% or one penny, they are bunch of CROOK specially OWNER, l paid them $18,900.00 to get my case done in 9 mounts but 3 years is past and never done even half of what they supposed to do.
Owner (Arian Eghbali) hides himself from client and never contact the client, people are working there like Monica, Marzie, Nazi, Nooshin and all of the employees are nothing to do except lying and stealing money, they have no personality and very low class and cheap people.
I am giving you my horrible experience to save your time and your money to don't do any business with this devil people, this was worst decision l have ever made in my 60 years life to do business with this trashy company and people are working in it.
I trusted them only bcz they are Persian but they are nothing except being shameful for Persian community.
BEWARE OF THIS DISHONEST COMPANY AND PEOPLE AND STAY AWAY FROM IT.

They don't do anything special, you can do better than them, I called couple of creditor and settle with them with much less than what they did.
I also found out BBB (Better Business Bureau) closed the account of this company bcz of too many complain and no respond.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This company and the owners are making bogus statements, and promises. Never ever did any follow up, nor took any action to even try to correct the errors. They want just your money and then you can not get hold of anyone to act or contact you. Just talk, no serious action, no response, all is based on dishonest and unethical business  practice . They tell you something else on the phone, and do nothing in reality.
And the funny thing is they have no shame of taking your money and not refunding nor answering you.  They deserve zero star.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2990edbe1ac7b:0xea2677d90682e421</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I called enrich financial to help me out.  Was quoted by someone for both my husband and I repair.  When I called back to set up they claimed that it was for only one person and wanted more money and could care less that the individual Arian specifically was dishonest about the quote and wouldn’t honor it.  Not to mention they claim they record all
Conversation but would refuse to give back and listen on the one I had that clearly quoted me for both of us.   I call back to tell Tara I’m going with someone else and that they should make sure it doesn’t happen again and it’s not right so she hangs up on me!   This company is unprofessional to say the least.   Make sure you do your research their are companies that can do the same for a lot less<//Text>< Response>

Absolutely wrong advertising and misleading.

Back in 2015 i went there and they charged me almost $3000 to repair my credit which was very small points in my accounts and needed to remove after 2 years they requested me another $650 for some stupid reason and i paid for that as well but now after 42 months i still have same negative points into my account and i still have to call them and ask them what happened. The funny thing is a rude lady called me and she said that one of your inquiries was already removed but she does not know that people are not stupid and all inquiries automatically removed after 2 years. Super disappointed and never and ever recommend anyone to this company.< /Text>

Do not use Enrich financial for your credit card and debt concerns. They advertised and told me for a monthly retainer they would settle my debt then later on repair my credit history. In fact, I ended up settling all my debt myself and one credit card company filed a judgment and default and levied my accounts— they falsely advertise providing legal services and they suck money out of your account and ignore calls and emails. I gave them thousands of dollars of money for me to do all the work. STAY AWAY<//Review>

My name is Arian Eghbali, and I am the Chief Executive Officer of Enrich Financial.  There are many financial issues facing consumers today, such as estate planning, insurance, investments, and taxes, to name a few.  We are in the business of helping our clients meet all of their financial challenges. We do this by using a total wealth management approach. Each area is important individually, but managing them all collectively is one of the most important considerations in your overall financial success.

This Credit Repair Book focuses on only one aspect of our business.  Back in 2008, I decided that I wanted to focus more of my time and energy on assisting regular consumers, for whom this book has been prepared, to improve their credit health.  I realized that members of the upper middle class and wealthy citizens had adequate resources to hire large accounting, law, and financial consulting firms to handle their affairs, but that there was a shortage of companies working for the common, working man and woman.

That’s why I started a credit repair division of my company.  We have been successfully helping clients for years, by providing them with affordable plans and approaches to improve their credit.  This easy-to-read book provides you with the basics of credit repair so that you might have an overall appreciation of what needs to be done.  I’ve tried my best to use plain, understandable words and to make this book user-friendly.   If you have the time, energy, and emotional wherewithal, you can perform many of these tasks yourself.  In the event that you do not, we’ll be happy to handle the repair of your credit for you.< /Review>

We Paid this company A LOT!!!!! of money to help fix our credit. I regret ever trying to do business with them! Please DO NOT! invest any of your time with these people who take your money and NEVER do anything but give you the run around! From a Dissatisfied customer!!!!!!

P.S. Their reviews come from friends of co-workers, Some even are made up just for good reviews. I wouldn't even give then 1 star if I had the choice!!!!!< /Text>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN IT, THEY ARE SCAM AND CROOK , ALL OF 5 STARS REVIEWS ARE LIE, THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT STEALING YOUR MONEY AND LYING, THEY ARE SPECIALIZE IN THAT, NEVER EVER TRUST THEM, OWNER IS BIG CROOK AND NEVER RESPOND TO YOUR MESSAGE AND NEVER TALK TO CLIENT BCZ HE KNOWS HE IS RIPPING OFF THE PEOPLE, ALL THE EMPLOYEES ARE VERY RUDE AND VERY EASY TELLING LIE.
I CALLED BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU TO COMPLAIN  AND THEY SAID THEY CLOSED THEIR ACCOUNT BCZ OF TOO MANY COMPLAINS AND NO RESPOND FROM THEM.
IF YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THIS UGLY PEOPLE MAKE SURE DON'T PAY THEM ADVANCE , LET THEM FINISH JOB AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING OK THEN PAY THEM AND WATCH DON'T OVERCHARGE YOU.< /text>

<Text>On 03/2016 I have spoken to Ben for reviewing my case , given him permission to see my credit report and after two times giving him my credit permission, and several phone calls I gave up on them. Three weeks went by , no call no e-mail from Ben and his co-worker. They were not in touch with me and they only talk about money up front along with sweet talk originally. I have had bad experience with them , they don't represent a good and professional company and their representation on 670 am as a great company to help others are inadequate , unprofessional ,and misrepresented.
Sincerely,
MRK.< /Text><user>112993226426172950859< /user>< user_name>

Arian Eghbali and his company are great.I am so grateful to have found them.I missed several payments and debts on my credit cards and had ruined it.I spoke with his specialist Mrs.Nazy.She knew exactly what to do .Today ,my credit score is above average and I feel confident that I will be able to keep it that way.I did not know what I would have done without this company.<//text>

< review>
I am so grateful to have found them. I missed several payments on my credit cards and I had ruined my credit score. I didn't even know how to begin to improve it. A friend recommended this company and they changed my life. I spoke with Eliza on the phone and she was very friendly, she knew exactly what to do. I was embarrassed to let her know my credit score and the mountain of debt that I was dealing with, but she was really helpful and did not judge me. She also educated me on ways to prevent this from happening again. Today, my credit score is above average and I feel confident that I will be able to keep it that way. I don't know what I would have done without this company. I would definitely recommend Enrich Financial and Credit Repair Specialist to anyone looking to improve their credit score. Thank you Arian Eghbali !<//review>

<Text>My biggest regret that I even started my service with them! Here are my reasons !
I don't usually like to leave negative comments on anybody but I really have to, today !
******If you don't want to go through headaches and you want someone to handle your case with responsibility and caring, read this !*******
1) 3 years of waiting, and still not done ( for settlement and credit repair) amount of debts: around $25000 for 4 accounts! ( left my case unfinished, will explain his excuse on last paragraph)
Paid over $6000 in full for his service, in the first few months of starting the service 2015)
2) was told at first meeting back in 2015, that he gets about %80 discounts on my cards and will only take few months! None of them happened! Not even close !!!!!
3) never ever believe him if he emails you or leave a message to his staff that "he will call you back in 10 days, 2 weeks or 8 weeks!" He never ever did and he never stuck to his promises !
4) just viewed my credit report and guess what? I am not even half done !
5) got judgement in one of my accounts when they were handling my case and did not know how that happened ! Plus I almost got no discount for my settlement !
4) was told that I need to purchase protection plan due to " hacking thing going on with "Equifax" back in October and paid $380 for that!
I called to get info and my docs on this protection plan in few weeks, the staff either had no info or if they had, they all had different ones about what this is ! I was told that Ms. Ana handling this! , every single time I called, she was at the meeting and they said " she will call u back"! Nope, never did !
THEN, in January 2018, I got an email from Mr .Eghbali that not to call the office AND He will send your docs in 8 weeks!!
(BTW, since I was not getting any answers, I called Equifax myself and they said, nothing was established under your account and you have no locks or anything under ur name !
I did email Eghbali and his staff regarding this, but he did not reply or made any comments about that!
Anyways, instead of 8 weeks, I waited extra 10 weeks with no emails or contacts, then had to follow up because no follow up on his side !
Same thing happened, I called and staff did not have any answers, except one lady said, " oh there is no documents, user name/ password or account # for this. It could be just a confirmation or our contract! I was like, ok then just send me whatever you have ! She sent me that, you have no idea what it was !!!!!
I wish I could attach it here ! It a small blurry small note with no numbers or anything , it was just basically saying that proof of address, copy of my social ( the verification part) went through and it said the next step was enrollment , activation and all that which I never got info on that !!!!!!
In summery, I asked to cancel this protection plan due to no accurate and clear info provided, INSTEAD of solving this , Mr Eghbali decided to terminate this service and leave his whole job unfinished and his excuse was my follow ups and calls were a lot ! Plus he made some accusations on how I was talking or treating his staff !
I am fully confident about myself and I know how, what and when had to follow up! I have proofs in all !
Wow! You don't reply or follow up on your emails then you complain about me calling your office to get answers !!! If your staff don't have answers as you are saying, then you need to follow up with me for my case !
For someone that keep pushing it back to   , next 8 weeks, next 10 days, next 12 weeks just to provide any answers on anything and at the same time, he complains about " out of control" calls, what can I say !???? You asked for 8 weeks to get my doc on protection plan , I gave you over 10 weeks, then you still complain about my calls after that time period you asked for ? I can't follow up to get my doc on something that I purchased 6 month ago?
Anyways, at the end , He didn't even bother to call me to give 5 min update on my status as of now and just left it like that !
He waisted 3 years of my life< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

My sister's credit score was like 760 or so, but my score was 554, since we were both going to be the guarantors for the property, I had to get my score higher. After I hired these guys, it began to rise up like magic. Thank you Enrich Financial.</review>

As suggested by one of my friends I contacted Enrich Finance Credit Repair services and after a quick response of their team, I explained my credit related problem with my creditors. They provided me a simple three step process that helped me fixing my bad credit in an efficient and reputable manner and they also showed me how to improve credit scores. They have a group of experienced team of advisers and assistants to help fixing any type of credit related problems through reputable means. It was fast and easy. The guy named Arian Eghbali was of great help. I was worried about my problem but Arian gave me detailed explanation of how to proceed or what needed to be done. They have 100% guarantee to erase our bad credit related problems. They helped me such that there is no need to pay any extra money to any other credit repair company. Truly it was a worthy experience at no cost.Thanks for being so helpful to customers.<//text>

This people are a fraud they just take your money and don't do anything about fix your credit. From the beginning I should of known they were just a bunch of liar. The first time i went to their office i spoke with some lady named Angenia or something like that. She told me everything i wanted to hear so i set up another appointment to come sign the contract the day of the appointment they said she wasn't in the office and two seconds later i saw her with my own eyes in the office and she just played dumb. They told me the some other guy was going to help me . When i spoke to him he told me totally different from what she told me. All he care was for me to give him the check and the sign contact. I left the office with confusion still . I try to call their office and the angenia lady its never at the office so  then i end up talking to some other lady named alana or lana . She is telling something completely different as well. I spoked to her and i told her i wanted to cancel doing business with them . And she is just treated me like im retarded. Why i shouldn't cancel my agreement with them. When i was told by angenia i could cancel my agreement whenever i wasn't happy with them. Now im trying to do so and its been a nightmare. She even left me a voicemail saying that she would return my money and just today she flat out told me they weren't going to give my money back.

If you dont want to get a headache find a lawyer.
Im to take them to court for malpractice and laying to innocent people.< /Text>

Mr. Arian and his staff are the real deal. The last 6 months they have been relentlessly working on getting my negative credit history removed. I actually got results and my credit score is higher that it ever was before. Thank you once again!!</review>

.. And they carry an extensive line of my favorite incense. I was super impressed! This looks like something that you would find in a big city. It was super clean and the customer service was on point and really knowledgeable. I bought my first CBD pen there and was more than pleased with the recommendation.

Employees are all super helpful and kind. They have a wide range of products and great deals. Plus, a HUGE selection of incense that I've always been a big fan of, not to mention some beautiful decor.
Appreciate you guys so much! Thanks for going above and beyond. 🖤</Text>

This is a really laid back place to wash your clothes. The daytime/night Staff are super helpful. They offer washer options starting from single up to eight loads! One washer can do eight loads at one time! That was new to me!< /review>

I love the customer service! There is a very helpful young lady there who was very attentive to everyone. The laundry-mat is well maintained. I would recommend this place for the vending machines, well priced washing machines and fast drying dryers.<//Text>

I really like this laundrymat. The owners are really nice people and when the change machine didn't give me my proper change they took care of me. 😀 A lot of improvements have been made in the short time I've been going there.<//text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>This place definitely isn’t as great as the reviews led me to believe. The attendant had doors locked at 920pm. Google maps hours listed state they’re open til 11. She barely let us in the door to dry our comforter. The machines are not new. They’re scraped up on the inside. We drove here from diamond bar because of the reviews and the appearance of the machines. Considering our dryer took a dump and we were concerned our White microfiber down feather comforter would get ruined at other places. Fingers crossed it comes out dry and without rust stains.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1554315722006, 'text': "Thank you for your comments and review.

I really Love this place especially the employees, but the only problem is mostly all the machines are out of order, the ones that do work dont work correctly and you basically have to play a guessing game with the dryers to see which one will really dry your clothes...< /Text>

{'time': 1528867465486, 'text': 'Thanks Sylvia for your review and we love you too. As far as machines go we have made a lot of changes since we took over 2 years ago and more changes are coming.

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place. While one dryer burned all my bed sheets, the other dryer stained all my white shirts. Save time and money by going to another laundromat. I like to support my local businesses but not when it's costing me time and money. By the way, this is not the first time I wash and dry my belongings.

I do not recommend this place. While one dryer I burn my sheets the other spot all my white shirts. Save time and money, go to another laundry. I like to support local businesses but not when they waste my time and money. And another thing, it's not the first time I wash and dry my things.

No recomiendo este lugar.  Mientras una secadora quemo mis sabanas la otra mancho todas mis camisas blancas. Ahorren tiempo y dinero, vayan a otra lavandería.  Me gusta apoyar a negocios locales pero no cuando me hacen perder tiempo y dinero.  Y otra cosa, no es la primera vez que lavo y seco mis cosas.< /text>

Wanted to try a different Thai place. Unfortunately here the curry was too watered down, and the ingredients weren’t cooked long enough in the curry that they were still hard. The egg rolls weren’t bad, and the pad Thai was fine. Overall we did not enjoy the meal.<//text>

For a Thai restaurant that isn't in Thai town or No Ho, this place is pretty good. They specialize in a lot of Northern Thai dishes, but I wasn't thrilled with my Khao Soi. Delicious, certainly. I ordered mine with crab and the crab was the best choice in my humble opinion. My big issues with my soup though was that it wasn't very hot when it came to me. I need my soups hot. Veggie egg rolls were good, don't forget to check in cause you will get them on the house if you drop $40. Coconut ice cream was too icy (not the way it should be) and the fried chicken was too dry. I will come back again though cause I am curious about the chicken over rice...</review>

We got 2 dishes, the spicy basil pork with rice and the fish with mango sauce. Both dishes we great. We got the spicy basil pork with medium spice and it was the perfect amount of spice for us although I can see that for some it may still be too spicy. The star of the dinner was the fish with mango sauce. The fish is thin, fresh and breaded perfectly. It gave a satisfying crunch even with the delicious mango sauce. They are also kid friendly. The staff was super friendly and checked up on us the right amount.<//review>

<Text>I live a 30 min drive away and by some decent Thai places, but this place is worth the extra drive! It is the best tasting Thai food I've had in LA, which is saying a lot. I can tell they use higher-quality ingredients because I feel good after eating here. Their Khao Soi noodle curry and Tom Yum soup are incredible! I actually get sad when I am full and know its time that I should stop eating it. I try to comfort myself that I can have leftovers, but it is still sad to have to stop having that wonderful perfect flavor.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Shared the Shrimp balls with plum sauce, Minced Pork LARB Salad just south of Thai Spicy, and Pad C Ew with Crispy Pork Belly. It was an explosion of wonderfulness in my mouth. The pork was crispy and melty. Every bite was amazing. ❤️</Review><user>115197354074699088927< /user>< Pictures>

<text>The serving sizes are huge! We had the Tom yum soup with coconut milk and fried chicken with rice. It was Super delicious! Will definitely recommend and visit again :)

Here again for the second time and had the signature curry noodle, pork Brazil rice with tofu and shrimp balls. It was super amazing, we love everything we tasted and will come again if we visit LA! 🙂</text><date>1562970261782<//date><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

Ordered takeout many times and the food was great. But sitting down at Khao Soi Thai makes all the difference— the warm lighting and family feel, the kind service led by Woody who seems to remember every face!
The khao Soi noodles melt in your mouth. Seriously, my only Thai restaurant in Studio City!<//Review>

Finally found Khao SOI in LA!!! This Chiang Mai’s speciality dish is hard to find and this place has the best one!!!! Must try!!!
I wish they would have chicken w/ bones(leg and Thigh) like they do in Thailand.
As always, know your Thai spice level. Their medium is pretty spicy. Enjoy it!!!!!<//text>

< Review>
The food here USED to be fantastic, but since Arie sold it the new owners have brought it down to the level of ordinary. I used to think this was the most authentic Thai restaurant in the area, not anymore. My wife ordered Penang curry with crispy pork, the pork was 90% fat, when I called to complain the owner said the pork we use is pork belly?! I’ve cooked pork belly and that’s not it. What a shame. We’ll be talking our business back to The Rustic Spoon.<//Review>

< Review>
I had the Panang Curry a few weeks ago loved it and came back for more, but when it came out it looked watery and it had the flavor of sour from Tom Kah. When I told the 3 staff members who came up to offer an opinion they all told me I was wrong. One of the servers offered to thicken it up which would have done nothing to remove the sour flavor that was probably added by accident. Needless to say, I’m sure I can find another Thai restaurant in Studio City that will be more consistent and customer service oriented.<//Review>

But don't miss it. It's a hidden gem. I say this because their food is really as delicious and as authentic as it gets, like something out of the Sherman Way Thai restaurants and Thai town in Hollywood. I think I've been here at least 5 times already, and I was always satisfied each time. What do I most recommend? Definitely, their Khao Soi noodles, which is a delicious coconut curry soup with noodles and chicken. Very good. I also loved their shrimp cake balls, their fried chicken, their pad kee mao, the crab fried rice, the pad gra pow over rice, the papaya salad. There's just too much to name. And you cannot miss out on the mango sticky rice dessert, when it is available in season. It's really one of the best I've had in a Thai restaurant or as street food.

So if you're in Studio City and looking for a great Thai restaurant, come to this place. I can safely say it's one of the best restaurants in Studio City, and the ambience is pretty cool here. Nice outdoor and indoor seating, and very reasonably priced. And Nicky was a great help!

I shot a Youtube video of my eating experience at Khao Soi Thai, which you can find on my Youtube channel, Rockstar Eater.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgK1KB8c16SMGAnkE1BaXkvSAJUO5jObpc6sqb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEqu7dwjQYmkGnFKbW7tnIiWAsx0uEzLaoDOjB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtM2hcs2uC9GCxf6GW978K41R_lF9psMzVzrIQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

I came for the Khao Soi (can choose your protein and spice level) but I stayed for the crab fried rice, pad see ew, and spicy basil!

The Khao Soi is incredibly flavorful and the flavor is thick (it's a curry)but the soup is light and doesn't leave me feeling overly stuffed. The noodles are thick and LONG (I keep forgetting to ask for a knife - probably a faux paux) to cut the noodles... necessary when sharing the dish, which I highly recommend.

Crab Fried rice was delicious and the spicy basil (with pork) had me spooning in more before I even finished my first bite. I can't explain the flavors other than a must-try-for-yourself.

They have indoor as well as a cute outdoor, patio seating area- if the weather permits (ha- it's LA, aka always prime weather) and there's open seats I highly suggest sitting outside.
It's prime location on Ventura Blvd. but hidden in the shopping center where Peets coffee/Chin Chins is. Don't let the hidden gem aspect deter you, there's underground parking at the end of the alley.

I haven't tried anything here I didn't like and I'm determined to try the whole menu over time.

Along with serving delicious, authentic Thai cuisine,
Eric the owner, is the absolute best. Willing to talk, share and answer any questions or concerns.
I want to shout it from the top Runyon Canyon- Khao Soi Thai is your new favorite Thai place!< /text>

Very good food and true flavors of Thailand. Very good service, although there are many people, it is worth waiting for. They never lose their good attitude. Try their Khao Soi dish, typical of the northern part of Thailand.

Muy buena comida y sabores verdaderos de Tailandia. Muy buen servicio, aunque haya mucha gente, vale la pena esperar. Nunca pierden su buena actitud. Prueba su platillo Khao Soi, tipico de la parte norte de Tailandia.</Text>< pictures>

The sale on the candles🕯️ that was a 2 1/2 trip. Well I seem to have gotten the wrong smells. So they helped me pick out better ones</text>

It always smells nice in there, and the staff are always so nice and willing to help. It's like walk-by aromatherapy, just gives you an overall feeling of calm and wellness. Plus, with coupons, I always get a great deal!< /Review>< pics>

Sad to see that Pho Craft is gone. The owners were very nice, friendly and excellent chefs. I will miss their food and company. I wish them the best and hope they give it another try when we get past the current situation.

05/17/20
Update from the staff at Pho Craft:

We are happy to announce that we are open for take out orders beginning Monday, May 18th.

Our current Store Hours
Monday-Saturday: 11:00 am - 8:00 pm
Sunday: Closed

12/19
The House Special Pho was highly recommended and I can see why. The broth is rich and has a depth of flavor that reflects the use of cooking the soup with the bones for hours. We had a chance to speak to the chef who described how she makes the broth. No wonder it tastes so good.

Delicious food and friendly staff. Just a nice place to have a good meal. Prices are very reasonable.<//review>

<Text>Pho Craft is no more sadly, it's changed to Pho May.  Pho Craft was special. The owner was nice and remembered us whenever we came in.  I think Pho May might be Pho May the chain, which is pretty typical.  Good, but not on the same level as Pho Craft.  I hope they manage to reopen after the pandemic.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Great service and pho broth is different and refreshing! Love the broth and the option to choose different types of noodles and variety of proteins. My children love their pan fried noodles and egg rolls.< /Text>

Found a new Pho place in Cypress. I ordered the brisket and Ribeye meats with the small fresh rice noodles. I was surprised the broth was flavorful to my liking. Just the right amount of spices. The menu is simple and to the point.  There is something for everyone. I met the owner and complimented her on the restaurant opening and wished the business well. Support small businesses because it matters. If you like this review, please click the like button. Thank you and have a good day!< /Review>

<Text>Pho Craft has quickly become our favorite pho place! We love the home-cooked taste of their entrees and our kids like that they can customize their pho from the broth down to the type of noodle and protein.<//Text><time>1609641090464<//time>< rating>

<Date>1572760984821<//Date><rate>4</rate><Review>Like the idea of being able to choose your broth and 2 proteins, or going with one of their combinations. I had their seafood special which had shrimp, fish, squid and imitation crab with fresh noodles and the usual pho fixings...delicious! They were a little short-staffed today so service was a little slow,  but they did have a help wanted sign on their window.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had the house special with big fresh noodles and it was delicious.  The portion is big and the price is decent.  However, the entire restaurant has only one booster and the waitress didn't offer the high chair until we ask for it.  Overall, I recommend this place .< /review>

<text>Nice friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is clean. We went there a little bit before lunch time, by the time we done, there's a line. The pho was good. The broth was just right, neither salty or sweet. The meats were tender and juicy. Overall, we had a great time with the food and the people. Highly recommend if you are in the area.</text></record>

The service takes forever and as knowing what true Vietnamese phở tastes like. The food came in big portions. All of the food was salty and it came in such big sizes that it felt disgusting. The price was reasonable fit how much they gave. They are very understaffed and it took a long time for tables to be bussed. I wouldn't go back.< /review>

This is the best pho ever! The broth has so much flavor, fresh noodles and a ton of veggies. The portions are huge and they don't skimp on noodles, veggies or toppings. Service and quality are unmatched.</text>

I'm a Vietnamese living in the Bay Area (San Jose) in Northern Cali where there are lots of Pho places. The pho's broth at this place is just OK. Just need a little more salt. For the price they charged, they're being cheap on the filet mignon. Not the best pho that I've ever had. I wouldn't come back to Phocraft again.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The first time I eat Vietnamese rice noodles in this shop, the price is higher than the average shop. But the amount is more, the real thing is that the main beef noodles will give you a big ribs and beef slices. The only thing I didn't like very much was that their soup base was salty.

第一次在这家店里吃越南米粉，价格比一般的店高一些。但是给得量也比较多一些，很实在的是主打的牛河粉里会给你一块大大的排骨，和牛肉片。唯一我不太喜欢的是他们的汤底咸了一些。<//Review>

Love this store and their jeans.  Every pair of Lucky jeans I’ve bought have lasted years and years.  The sales staff is super helpful and friendly too.  The few times I’ve been to this location I’ve been able to find pretty good sales, it’s definitely worth checking out.<//text>

I ended up buying 5 pieces, enjoying the retail indulgence guiltlessly. The jeans of course are the real prize here, fitting perfectly, comfortable as skin, and great-looking! Lucky, that brand from another decade, is still the best.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><UserId.>117118958367007305495<//UserId.><review>I time to time stop at buffalo wild wings restaurants for some wings and drink, recently they heavily advertised their all American hamburger.

Last night i stopped at their culver and 5 free way restaurant and ordered the horrible oily greasy all American hamburger.

This is just another food scam by buffalo wild wings restaurants, the $20 burger was nearly 70% beef and 30% fats, very greasy and oily, thin beef patty's, oily grilled onions setting on chopped lettuce, the Cesar salad i ordered was 50% croutons and very bad quality lettuce, very terrible salad.

The burger was not only tasteless but very fatty and oily, their fountain Pepsi drink @ $3.79 plus tax is more expensive than Morton steak house soft drinks, a total ripoff.

Looking at my experience, it was terrible from lousy host at the door to the service provided and horrible food, i don't recommend this Restaurant neither i do recommend the horrible all American hamburger, putting the $20 for the lousy burger and $5 tip the Restaurant is total ripoff.</review>< name>

Sit up at the Bar, Tues-Sat 4pm-Close.  Matt is 100!  If Shannon is around, she is chatty, in a very pleasant, friendly and sweet way.  They will take care of you.</review>

<review>Love this little spot! I forgot to review this place based on when I visited before quarantine but I loved the atmosphere and the brunch was great! The rigatoni pasta and the chilaquiles were phenomenal and the drink menu looked delish though I didn't get to try it just then. Will hopefully be dining here again soon or doing takeaway!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I've never complained about a restaurant before but the service was so bad I finally had to leave the place if I was going to eat.
The bartender seemed to be working the whole bar with no waitress around. I finally got a beer but he never returned for my food order. I gave up my table to a group that were standing and drank the rest of my beer standing against a wall. The whole time they had the large dining room closed. Will never go back!< /Review>

So, this is not the typical place I would select if I just looked at the interior: If you didn't know, you would assume to be in a Dodgers fans' club house, with dark interior, multiple insignia, and endless screens. However, the food - typical by name - was in fact very good. What do you get: burgers - ha, no surprise! What did we really get apart from a decent beer: a very juicy and tasty Filet Burger, a Classic Burger, and a Turkey Burger, combined with Truffle Fries, Sweet Fries, followed by a charming Vanilla Bread Pudding with ice cream ... Again, for the food, I'd come back.</Review>

<review>I only give 1 star because they use door dash to deliver. I have been going to this location for years. Not a single problem. They are always great. I have ordered 2 times from here for delivery. Both of which were completed by door dash. By complete I mean my first order the driver ate my food. The second order the driver was 20 minutes late. My food was cold and all my boxes of wings were crushed like if someone sat on them. This location is always great for pickup and dine in. I refuse to do delivery as long as they use door dash. I feel bad for all the employees of this location who get the backlash of unsatisfied customers because of door dash.< /review>< pictures>

The food is good. Great wings and flavors. You can get a flavor on the side to try just in case. The street tacos are good with chipotle southwest sauce. Service is hit and miss. We go to the bar area most of the time. Seems like when its a little slower they take it easy and forget about tables. Overall its a good place for beers, wings and the game<//Text>

I think the last time I saw "Frogger" was on an old episode of Seinfeld.
Yep, there are classic arcade games mixed in with newer ones to enjoy with a cold one or a cocktail.  There is a full bar and a nice offering of food.
The pizzas looked and smelled great.
There is plenty of seating which is spaced out well.

The food came out surprisingly fast. I don't know if we were lucky or if that's really common at this one but I had my food brought to me within five minutes. And as you can see it was quite a bit.< /Review>

<Text>The worst out-of-town experience ever! I recommend Rock n Brews down the street to avoid the risk of encountering the "donkey" of a manager we encountered Sunday afternoon. I was so shocked that the manager did not seem to want the business from my family of 8 after barely reopening in-door dining from COVID. The workers were very accommodating. We wanted to sit with our tables in line, not all together as we know the new rules. The manager came in and decided he was going to be unprofessional. Ultimately, we ended up leaving in the middle of our drinks and moving our party to the ever so friendly Rock n Brews to eat, drink, watch football, and conversate on our last day in town.<//Text><username>Amber Neathery< /username>< Pictures>

Went by at night to see a podium outside with the phrase "sign in here". There was a young kid seating people he was one of the rude people I spoke with. He was also tasked with pulling to-go orders. I had a feeling of being processed and not helped. For example take the time to sort to-go and dine-in guests. If they like signs, make one extra one and a waiting area for to-go as well. One young woman snuck in and was helped by the Mgr. Quite the messy operation, but I suppose we are talking about wings here, right? 3 stars this was during the CoVid mess, but rude is rude. Curious to see if they improve...< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Wish I could give 0 stars.
Upon our arrival a gentleman advised us to chose the table. We wanted the table away from the sun. We realized the table was still dirty. So we waited to ask if we could get it cleaned up. 10 min go by still no one has helped us. I go inside to speak with someone who can come possibly clean our table and take our order. The guy at the register didn’t seem to happy to help or just seemed very shy to even speak to me. A shorter man said we will be right with you mam with a very non polite way. This instantly put me in a very bad mood. I said we haven’t been helped yet it’s been almost 15 since we sat down. He said there was tables before you when clearly we had arrived before they helped these 4 tables. This was upsetting not being acknowledged. I went back to my seat to wait for another 8-10 min and still no help or even water brought to our table. I had to get up and leave this business today for poor customer service. Very disappointed in BWW!</Review>< username>

<text>I can not express how incredible this restaurant is! The owner alone is very kind, my husband I would go once a week and the food was never a disappointment. Even when the restaurant gets busy the waiters and waitresses are always checking in on you. We can't wait for the grand opening, it'll be exciting to see what other food items are available! Montrose needed a ramen restaurant and Kontentsu is definitely it!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This location has been serving me for over a decade. Always a good experience and super tasty food. The new mustard wings are delicious. When I'm not in the mood for wings I get the crispy chicken sandwich. Don't forget about their happy hour, certain day deals and get your BWW points going. Cheers to all< /Review>

I paid 29.99 for 15/15 wings and when I opened it at home it was just 12 (6/6).
Seriously this is the worst experience.  Never going to try this place again in Irvine.< /review>

The wings are what San Tung is best known for but they also have the best jajangmyun. I normally don't like jajangmyun however, this was just amazing. Pro tip: when you're finished with your noodles, ask for white rice to mix it in as there's a lot of sauce leftover. Service isn't the greatest but this is Chinese food so I did not expect anytime more.<//Text>

Always busy place. Staff are always nice.

Though at this store, once a girl standing next to me waiting for her dasher order took my order 5 minutes before I got there. After she took her real order and left then I got the chance to show the app to the staff for my order I was told my order was given to that girl already. Funny thing is staff told me that girl showed to her the app and order items too. Someday I’m gonna get that order back.</review>

Great wings. A bit on the expensive side if you want to customize and sometimes they mess up my order.</text>

They catered a party for our sorority powderpuff football game and I couldn’t be happier with the service.  Wings were fresh and crisp, with proper sauce to chicken ratio, gave plenty of ranch and carrots/celery.  Wings were a hit</Review>

I like coming here to watch all the games. The wings are a must but cheese curds, and the spicy Nashville chicken sandwich are favorites too</review>

I love this place because I love Buffalo Wings. If you don't love Buffalo Wings you probably should stay away. I mean, I guess you could get a salad and watch other people make a mess of themselves but that would pry only entertain for a short while. Oh. You should like sports. They're everywhere.<//Text>

Arrived at 09:15 PM 02/17/2020 and a short white young babyface employee at front desk started acting racist.

I will post my review on Better Business Bureau as well - racism and cheapness should have NO place in Irvine.<//review>

In the ever present rivalry between BWW and Wingstop, the wing-off is won and lost in the execution. There are a few ways that the chicken here could be improved.

The chicken could definitely be juicier. The meat was dry and stringy. Then they can afford to put a bit more sauce on the wings. I don't know how much money they are saving from the reduced quantity of sauce, but they are losing revenue on people choosing their rivals.

The most mind numbing part is the service. No one is available to ask for the check, or refills, or asking questions. You have sit and wait... and wait... and wait. Not fun. I don't know why I came here...<//Text>

One of the best branches I've ever visited. Great staff, fast service, good quality food. However, because of the popularity of surrounding restaurants parking is limited and to add to it the parking spaces are smaller than usual.<//Review>

I always order the spicy wings and beer it's a good combination. There is so much you can try on the menu and taste all good. I have tried most of them when my family and I go out to eat dinner but I always have to order an extra spicy wings for myself.</text>

This Buffalo wild wings is pretty much like all the others. They have decent food and a fair beer selection, but the service is always a little slow. They get really busy during major sporting events, so plan accordingly if you intend to watch a championship game here.<//Text>

<Review>The location is nice and clean. Very busy at times and parking can be a pain. Once you find a spot your experience improves greatly. You are able to get that sports bar feeling that is also safe enough for a family night out. The food service was a little slow.<//Review>< response>

I ordered a Dr Pepper once to our main server, she said she’d get it but never brought it, another Server came to ask if we needed anything so we asked for it again but He forgot about us, we ended up getting our check and never received our Dr Pepper. They didn’t charge us for it so was obvious they never put it into the system.< /Review>

Ordered the sampler.  A big meal.  Chicken nuggets and cheese sticks were good, especially with the sauces.  Nachos were substandard and didn't have enough cheese.  A big sports bar, with many TV screens showing sports events and in-house games.  Most tables tall with bar stools, unfriendly to handicapped patrons.  Server was sporadically attentive but had too many tables to service.  Place was VERY noisy, as is typical of many sports bars.</text>

<Review>I always order the spicy wings and beer it's a good combination. There is so much you can try on the menu and taste all good. I have tried most of them when my family and I go out to eat dinner but I always have to order an extra spicy wings for myself.</Review>< date>

The location is nice and clean. Very busy at times and parking can be a pain. Once you find a spot your experience improves greatly. You are able to get that sports bar feeling that is also safe enough for a family night out. The food service was a little slow.<//Review>

Always one of my favorites.  I usually go with my son on Tuesdays and we get the buy one, get one free deal on the boneless wings, but he wasn't around on this trip so I over-indulged and at way too many boneless buffalo wings.  :)  only thing that could make BWW better would be if they served Coke products, not stinking Pepsi</Text>

My wife and I stopped by for dinner, and we had amazing service. From the time that we ordered our food to the time it got to our table was between 5-10 minutes, granted it was a Monday night. Our server, Martini (like the drink) was also incredible. He was very friendly, attentive and made the experience what it was (5 stars).This restaurant would do well to make sure they do not lose him. I look forward to our next visit and hopefully get Martini again. Keep it up Martini! You're a rockstar!</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Waitress literally rolled her eyes at my group twice for wanting to switch tables. All we wanted was a slightly bigger table so that we could stretch out and order more food. You can tell she wasn't having a good day and I felt really bad for her, but if you're going to be waiting on people, I think it's important to bring high quality customer service. The chicken wings tasted just ok, but that night I got terribly sick and had to call out from work. Needless to say, I won't be going into a Buffalo Wild Wings again.< /review><user_name>Melissa Badamain<//user_name><userid>104784887280355326286< /userid>< resp>

Service and wings are good. Other finger-foods are good too (mini corn dogs, nachos, etc). Beers are standard and could be better. Its really all about the ambiance for game nights because there are TV's and sports fans everywhere. So go with with your sports buddy and it will be fun!< /review>

Called ahead and drove out because they said they close at 9. Sign on the door said 9 would be holiday hours for the night; when I walked in at 815 was told they already took the last order and were very smug. I wasted time and gas, plus I was already worried because I've gotten some of the worst bww here, there were limited food options< /review>

I've been to this location several times for lunch, usually around 11:30 or so. I don't remember a time that I needed to wait for a table. The place is usually pretty empty when I go. The staff had always shown great service and attentiveness, especially in the bar area. I've had inconsistent experiences with the wings and that is why I'm deducting a star. On some occasions, the wings are cooked spot on, on some others the wings are over cooked or not enough sauce or something. It would be nice if the wings came out consistently good if that makes sense. I feel like the snack lunch size wings are typically the ones that are inconsistent whereas if you order the non lunch wings those seem better.< /Text>

Wings are best when you order them with sauce on the side.  Skin stays crispy, and you can control how much sauce you want.  I originally was in love with their Mango Habanero, but it's' kind of lost its luster for me.  Garlic Parmesan, and the dry Salt/Vinegar are pretty good.  Service is also hit or miss, We usually sit at the bar, and those cats are cool.  Game days, this place is packed! Parking also sucks, and super small spots.  It'll be worse then the Korean spot opens.< /text>

The food is good, actually is is very tasty. Polite people. We ordered online and that is an easy thing. We decided to have their speciel Thursday offer which has a very good price. The difficulty is when your pick up the product you have to have a profile in their system to get this speciel price. Nowhere they mentioned that during the order process. When I picked up they asked for my profile. We do not have one so they  gave me a flimsy tablet to set up a profile. After I realized that people were waiting behind me I decided to pay the normal price and refused to set up a profile.

Where I went to the university I learned these kind of practice is called misleading customers and is illegal. But ,hey, that was centuries ago.

Nevertheless the food is great and the service is great.</review>< Rate>

Our waitress (Jennifer) literally threw the check on our table and left. She only came to our table once during the whole hour and a half we were there. We witnessed our waitress and 2 others workers messing around on their phones and chit chatting instead of taking care of their tables. We waited for 20 minutes to ask for ranch and silverware to eat our food and the waitress did not come by, so our food got cold. We got up and went to the the front to ask to speak with a manager and the lady up front was also sitting and playing on her phone while there were people coming through the door to be seated! The manager came out and did not seem concerned or considerate at all. Clearly no level of differentiation between management and servers. The manager comped one of our meals and ripped that receipt right in front of us. Didn't even apologize for the terrible service. The wings are clearly MICROWAVED and the carrot sticks are immitation carrots. Overall horrible experience. Go watch games at Yard House.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I’m never coming back to this location ever again, the manager Michael Parra is very disrespectful and unprofessional for lying to us regarding the offer that was given to us. I dined in 2 days ago and noticed there was a offer on the wall by the restroom to text the number and that I would get a free snack size wings, so I did and I got a text message which I have proof of that states I can redeem up to 3 days and to show the message to the server. I came in today with my family to dine in, I bought a meal for my daughter and then I showed the message to the manager yet he told me that they don’t honor that and that it has to be on the same day that we got that text message. I told him and showed him the message that states can redeem up to 3 days after the order, he still refused to honor and said that because their franchise they can’t honor it. This is false information either from the corporate or from that manager lying to us cause no where in the message does it state that and no where on the wall in their restaurant.  Even before all that happened, the manager had a bad attitude towards us at the beginning when we were ordering the food cause he had a awkward and irritated look on his face, for whatever reason he doesn’t like us it’s discrimination and I will report this matter to the corporate.</Text>

<review>This place is good when you find the flavors you like, and we've always had great service at the bar. Ordering from the app or at the counter has provided very mixed/bad results.

Also when that Korean restaurant across the lot is complete I would give up all hope of being able to park in that already tiny cramped parking lot. Short of renovating the lot, they need to at least re-math their lines to actually fit a normal compact car. Pretty goofy.

I recommend ubering here and sitting at the bar. The whole restaurant should be bar.< /review><UserId.>100889542534455347076<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x80dcdcf54cc4fafb:0x28d2450edbd531e0< /gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Text>This is my favorite place to eat. They have the best wings around. I know some people on here say that the flavors aren't that good. Well that's just their taste. They have awesome flavors. My favorite is teriyaki and asian zing. They great service. You will find bad service anywhere once in a while.<//Text>< Rate>

Food is good, but service sucks. I asked for a booth, but I was just told to wait, even I could literally see a vacant booth!!! When I asked to have the table wiped down, the employee who did it showed terrible attitude. What's more, my mom left her phone at the table, and so when I called BWW, they simply asked for my name and phone number and never returned the call! I called the number of the missing phone, and I expected one of the employees to pick it up, which no one did... My mom and I had to go pick it up ourselves.<//Text>

Great service and nice place but I made the mistake of ordering the boneless wings... I won't order those again, they were over breaded and felt like eating junk food.< /Text>

I come here purely to watch sports. Anywhere you sit there's a good view of the game or fight. I was here for the Rams/Chiefs game last night. They had it on about 70% of the screens, with the volume on in both rooms. Tall Modelo Especials were $5 during the game. I can't recommend the food here. The fries taste stale. The chips are super greasy. The naked tenders were ok. The boneless wings have a strange texture. The regular wings are... wings. I had the Blazin' Sauce here once, and no messing around, that is some spicy sauce at 200,000+ Scoville units!<//review>

<text>This is my favorite place to eat. They have the best wings around. I know some people on here say that the flavors aren't that good. Well that's just their taste. They have awesome flavors. My favorite is teriyaki and asian zing. They great service. You will find bad service anywhere once in a while.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmapID>

<Review>Wings came out cold and hard, happened multiple times, go to Wing Stop instead.

Edit: came in again and had a homeless man panhandle at our table and several other people’s tables. Server tossed our wings down and kept walking without saying anything.

I never got a refill on my water.

Please do not support this business.<//Review>< gmapID>

Really disorganized servicing. I paid online at 5pm. Pickup scheduled for 530pm to bring to a game that starts at 6pm. Get there at 524pm, tell them I'm there to pick up a paid order. They continue taking other walk in orders after me, ring them up answer phone orders then go to check on my order when they feel like it. All the while my order has been sitting on the kitchen counter getting cold. I had enough time to type this up for 20 minutes. Poor excuse of a management. Not buying here again.<//Text>

Happy hour until 6pm on weekdays (not sure about weekends) and half off traditional wings on Tuesdays.  Beer and chicken. They just go together.</Review>

Service is hit or miss.  I'm a regular that comes during the week on wing days and most of the time it's not too busy. Wings are good and the beer ice cold. Had an incident I brought up to management. Never followed through with his promise.</text>

Service sucks, food sucks, everything sucks. The server spilled coke all over me and didn't even apologize for it. They should train their staff properly.</text>

<Text>I like the concept but I don't have a single wing flavor I absolutely love. I personally prefer KFC hot wings over BW wings.

Staff was friendly enough, buy would stay away from this location due to the fact that they charge extra for sides of ranch. The rule here is one ranch for every 15 wings or they add on an extra 60 cents extra for any additional ranch. This is the only buffalo wild wings that has ever charged me this strange fee, so this will be the only bww that i will avoid.<//Text>

First time I called usual time 1:35 so then today 08/17/2016 I called ten minutes earlier and the lady who answered says "we already took our last call ten minutes ago" I'm sorry but you guys close til 2:00! And the wings do not take long to do every single time I've called at 1:35 I get there at 1:47ish and my wings are done already I call this bullshit and lazyness they just wanna go home early sorry but this is your job!!!!< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcdcf54cc4fafb:0x28d2450edbd531e0<//gmap_id>< resp>

<Text>Shiek and Morgan gave us amazing service tonight. Huge shout out for Buffalo Wild Wings. We were soo impressed with the prompt, friendly service and tag teaming these gentlemen did we went out of our way to allow the manager know as well.

OH YES the food. The boneless strawberry siracha (seasonal) wings are awesome. I totally drank my blackberry limeade down (awesome non-alcoholic drink). We will definitely be coming back.

Thanks guys!<//Text>< user_name>

I love BWW, but horrible service in the Irvine location. Took 25 minutes to get a freaking chips with Queso...and about 45 minutes for some wings. Even the check took like 10 mins. The manager at this location should be fired. Employees where to busy playing with their phones than taking care of people. .< /review>

The worst service I have ever had in my life! The waiter was rude it seemed as if he hated his job. I would never ever go back to this place. Now I know why it was super empty!!</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I went there because it wasn't appropriate to sell Chimaek at Irvine, but buffalo wings can be salty and not so good for Koreans. Cheese nachos recommended

(Translated by Google) Place to watch the game and drink beer, eating chicken wings, the atmosphere is very good. There are boneless chicken wings with bones can point, remember the main points of bone-in chicken wings taste better
