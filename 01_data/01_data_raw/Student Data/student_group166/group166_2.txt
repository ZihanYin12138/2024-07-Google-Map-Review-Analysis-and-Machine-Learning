Great location right on the Esplanade Beach with some amazing views of the bay, not too far from Colma Bart Station and located right on SamTrans Bus Routes. Good Amenities including the Club House and Covered Parking Garage.

A big shoutout to the staff here - Zee and Mike. Zee is a special person who loves her job and ensures everything is taken care of!</Review>

I just finished moving out of my apartment at OceanAire after living there for 9 months. I was moving to the Bay Area and needed to find something quick, easy, and safe and OceanAire was just that. I knew I couldn't stay long term due to it being out of my budget but it would be manageable for the short term with money I had saved. If money wasn't an issue I would have never left! They're pricey but it's definitely worth it.

Not only is the quality of living very high but their team of staff is what makes them truly stand out. Gina helped me from the beginning, showing me the units that were available and everything else after with getting approved and signing the lease. She should be the standard for leasing agents, so patient, warm and personable, and not pushy whatsoever.

The manager, Zee is also one of the nicest people I've come across in the CA rental industry. She's incredibly responsive to emails and any issues and is really everything you'd want in an apartment manager.

Maintenance requests were always resolved very quickly which was really nice. I really can't think of 1 bad or negative thing over the last 9 months I spent there. Definitely an amazing place to live if you have the chance, take it!</text>

<Text>I’ve been living here for a year and a half now and I love it. I’m just blocks away from the ocean with a really nice cliff path. Compared to other similar apartments in the area the rent here is decent. The property is really pet friendly which was a huge plus for me. They’ve also done a lot of updating and it looks really nice! The office staff is friendly, and maintenance is fast too. Most of the apartments seem to have in-unit laundry, plus there are multiple laundry rooms on the property. It’s a quiet area, stays cool and foggy most of the time, which I like. In addition to garage parking there is plenty of street parking in the neighborhood as well.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< resp>

Me and my friends were looking for a new one bedroom apartment close to San Francisco. We explored around 15 apartment complexes in South San Francisco. We set our priority according following criterias - location, price and conditions. Oceanarie Apartments is the one which met our expectations. It's located just by Pacific Ocean and 15 mins away from SF. Townhouses are renovated newly both exterior and interior. Also, we got $2000 off for signing lease agreement as a promotion. Now we are living here for last 6 months, and thinking to resign our lease for another 9 months. Special thanks to Veronica Avelar and Marisol Espino from leasing office. They are helpful. Also, beach access was restored, so now we have a full access to the beach<//Review>

Horrible Construction/Renovtion Disaster!!

I moved in 4 months ago and this has been going on for 3 months. It's 6 days a week of noise and 7 days a week of inconvenience, unsightly equipment, multiple dumpsters, materials, trash, construction vehicles and debris. My parking is in the other half of the complex, across the street, so I've been dealing with the mess since the beginning of the demo in June.

For over a month, the gym was closed, the common "oceanview patio with free wifi" was covered in junk, the common rec room was closed, and even the office was closed. They haven't used their app even once to broadcast messages to tenants. The grounds have been a disaster since mid-June -- as if they're not even going to pretend to keep up appearances.

In July, I stopped going down to look at the ocean, because they were ripping apart the buildings facing the ocean and it was just too depressing to see the mess everywhere. (PS - they said they were going to restore beach access that was washed out earlier in the year, but I'm not holding my breath. Google Maps still shows the path, but it's gone. Also the Oceanaire property map shows an ocean path, which is not there.)

They haven't done anything to contain the  work to a particular section of the property and complete one building before beginning demo on an adjacent building. Instead they work on another building on the opposite end. They are randomly criss-crossing lengthwise across the property (south-north) instead of working east-west). The way they're doing it, it's as if they're purposely trying to MAXIMIZE the  inconvenience of everyone and make it so that nothing looks pretty or peaceful or at all like home.

I was only given 6 days notice on 9/1 to clear my patio before 9/8 and to keep my windows closed for 2 months for renovation to my building. I had purchased $300 of patio furniture and plants when I moved here, not knowing that they were planning a major renovation and everything would all have to be stored inside.  4 days into my apartment renovation, the wrecking crew cut an electrical line to my kitchen and my refrigerator was without power for about 30 hours (and I'll have to toss everything). In the response to my online Maintenance request early that evening 9/12, a technician showed up at my door at 11:45 pm(!) and left at 12:45 am(!) without any resolution. The 2nd day they brought an extension cord. The 3rd day an electrician came to repair it and left the fridge hooked up to the extension cord and left a mess. The 4th day they came back to plug the fridge in properly and remove the extension cord (because I complained) and they still left the mess on the countertop, plus white handprints on my black fridge and countertop.  My 2nd story balcony was left completely exposed on 1 side for 3 days before they boarded it up. The front porch lights have been ripped off for 3 daya now and it's difficult to watch for hazards at night, especially because they leave junk everywhere in the walkways.

There has been no offer to reduce the rent and I've contacted a lawyer.

<rate>1<//rate><review>I was honestly very excited when I moved here. Working in the city, being a new person to the Bay Area, it seemed the perfect escape from the loud city, right on a sea cliff. It ended up being 9 months of Hell. I moved in last year right after the ownership switched from private to corporate (to Trinity properties) and right before the massive and invasive remodel. I was glad to read some of these other reviews echoing my frustrations. The office staff, a few in particular, have a way of dismissing you as the only one with an issue, when that's far from the truth. I have rented in most major cities in California due to my profession, and this is the only place I've ever had issues with like these. To start, the remodel was so invasive that people probably shouldn't have been in their units while it was done, all the outer walls were taken and left off on my building and left off for a few days due to the weather. This lead to my unit becoming infested with mice in July of 2017. Today, in January of 2018, I still have a mouse infestation. The leasing office is completely incompetent, my agent in particular is unprofessional, lacks overall knowledge, is unreliable and uncommunicative, and often doesn't even return calls, emails, or follow up. Working with her has given me so much stress and anxiety because I cannot rely on her to do her job. In the several months I've had mice, the exterminator came maybe half a dozen times, and only left sticky traps and one poison trap, which he never checks. So anything dead, just rots while I wait. The first time he showed up he had told us directly that the removal of the walls caused the mice, which he told the office, but the office denies of course. Most maintenance requests take a very long wait and for many of my requests I had to call and email because it was just sitting open without resolve OR it was closed when no work had been done. This is no offense to the maintenance, I actually like the head of maintenance and feel for them. He is often exacerbated with the office as well and stressed and they are clearly overworked, having to fix massive holes, for example, to the inner walls when the construction team would blast through them. This is just the tip of the iceberg, I could write a novel to be honest. I have pictures of the mice filth and damage to my personal property as well as emails showing the blatant negligence, which upper management from Trinity are CC'd on and they still do nothing. Despite my right to abandon the property and/or withhold rent due to the mouse issue in the state of California, when I gave my notice, the agent nonchalantly asked for the early lease break fee with no due date. I assumed then, after 2 unanswered f/u emails, that this was all due by my last day (like all other apartment leases I've read/signed), but apparently it wasn't because another agent called yesterday to let me know my account was in the red and I was being sent to their lawyers today just 2 weeks after I gave notice... I was never notified prior, so all I can assume is the ignorant agent who has had my lease this whole time either made these notes because she's trying to screw me out of some retaliation for the many complaints on her service or she's that incompetent. After my experience here, either is equally possible. I've spoken with my lawyer and he advised I can just abandon without paying considering the conditions but I was just going to pay so I could be done with them. However, now after this new issue AND seeing another mouse last night, I feel maybe I should let them take me to court so I can bring all the I have evidence against them. I'm just so exhausted with it all. I want to meet with the office manager to explain all of this, but I doubt he/she would even care. These people care about money, like any corporation, not people, that's clear. I do appreciate the one good office employee who called to warn me of the account issue yesterday, and certainly I feel for her as well. Please do yourself a favor and move anywhere but here, it's just an awful place.<//review>< Pics>

All apartments are the same. Deposits are not deposits when it comes to apartment life. It would be a lot easier if they just lumped them with upfront costs so that there is zero expectation you will get any money back when your lease ends.

We moved in Jan. of 2018. Rent was 2750. My rent spring of 2020 went up to 3400. I guess that is just Pacifica! When our lease ended a few weeks ago, we scrubbed every baseboard, bought special cleaner for the oven, cleaned the walls and cabinets, etc. Spent an entire day cleaning. They charged me 150 cleaning fee. 150 carpet cleaning fee (even though I paid 100 a month extra for my pets) and charged me for misc rent when I moved out a week prior to our lease ending on the 31st. We loved living at this apt and have left positive reviews in the past. Seems so simple to just be honest. It’s not even the money that is the problem as much as the lack of transparency. I spent over 85,000 in rent over the course of two years and they are going to nickel and dime me over a cleaning fees???< /Text>

We love living here! Our unit has been nicely updated and the location is perfect. One of our favorite things about living here is the friendly staff. I always feel welcome in the club house. Mike and Gina are always so friendly and Zee always greets us by name!  We also find the maintenance staff to be friendly and professional (Hey Dalton, we’re talking about you!)
Our service requests (3 minor requests) were all addressed within 24 hours. I’ve lived in other apartment communities were that was not the case!  Aside from the staff, we enjoy the small, but equipped, gym, the beach access and the spacious patios.  We would highly recommend this community! Thanks.</Text>

We have amazing views of the ocean around every corner or from your balcony!) Zee and Gina have been excellent in responding to any issues we have had! The move in was flawless and living here has been more than a delight. We are only here for 7 months but already talk about how much we will miss this place when we leave! Rent here. You won't regret it!!!< /text>

<text>This place has a serious rat problem, probably caused by the fact that every resident has their own outdoor trash can that sits feet from the door. I constantly see rats perched on my neighbors trashcans in the morning and at night, and have found their droppings in my unit. I have tried everything, no trash indoors, rat poison, but cannot seem to get rid of them. Oceanaire has provided 0 help and mainly denied the well known rat infestation.< /text>< gmapID>

I have lived at Oceanaire apartment homes for over a year now. The view is great, but don't expect to be able to reach management via the phone or for them to be of any help, or honest.

Normally if you call the leasing office it routes you to a 3rd party company to someone who is in another state...not super helpful if your kitchen is flooding for the third time in a year and you have to shuffle pots and pans full of dirty water every 10 mins or couple of hours for days while not being able to use your kitchen sink or dishwasher. During the pandemic since you cannot walk into the leasing office you can actually get them on he phone, I wouldn't expect that to continue once things resume to normal and they can cut costs.

Maintenance told me the cause of the flooding was the kitchen faucet being installed incorrectly (explains why the kitchen sink turned cold when the faucet indicated hot)

You would think thats the worst right?

During the superbowl my car was damaged by a 6 or so foot long and 2 foot wide piece of roofing tile that came loose that they have failed to repair to this day, 4 months+ after it happened, while my car was parked in between my building and the neighboring one in one of the 3 parking spaces available (if you move here realize it's one assigned parking space per unit and that you will not be able to find a spot on the street past 11PM due to all the homeless living in campers).

Despite the employees expressing sympathy for their property causing damage and significant depreciation to the value of my vehicle, and initialize accepting responsibility, their manager has refused to share their insurance company's information with me so that I can have them cover the $500 deductible.

The garage doors here constantly break and are left open so residents can use their vehicles, so if you own motorcycles don't think they will be safe here, or expect your vehicles to be secure. A few months ago my neighbor had their car window smashed our and their car looted in the garage, fyi.

Oceanaire apparently has valet trash service, I see it itemized on my bill every month, funny my "valet trashcan" disappeared two months ago.

When I initially was checking out Oceanaire the unit I rented was unavailable, so I had to tour a neighboring one.

When I inquired as to whether or not the advertised fireplace worked, I was told "kind of". What they meant was that the fireplace is sealed, but they were kind enough to install a cheap set of fake logs that have lights built into them, look fake and make a loud buzzing noise when turned on, not exactly great for watching TV in your living room or setting the mood for a date.

The hot tub is constantly broken. Prior to the pandemic I think I had access to it about 40% of the time I lived here. When I first moved in the jets in the hot tub were broken....I complained and they pretended it never had jets, even though it had a button to turn them on and and they would weakly run....several months later we got an email exclaiming they had "upgraded the hot tub to include jets". Ah yes, they must have bought the base model. These people treat you as if you just fell off the back of the turnip truck.< /Text>

Over the years the community has had its ups & downs - most noticeably when it underwent major construction for about a year (which drove many of the negative reviews online). They've made some great positive changes since then, most notably in management of the community. This remains a really nice place to live - quiet, comfortable, and with an ideal location right on the ocean. The staff are terrific. They are highly responsive and the maintenance team is the best (particular shoutouts to Mike, Zee, and Omar).
With that said, lately I've been disappointed with the amenities that OceanAire promotes front & center on their website as a value-add to residents. That lovely spa that you see on the home page? Hasn't worked for months; basically all summer. The fitness center? Machines are frequently broken or not properly maintained, and bizarrely there is a personal trainer running her business out of it all day which monopolizes the equipment. Be careful investing too much value in the beach access, because this part of the coastline experiences major erosion, which means restoration efforts need to happen which block or disrupt that access. (The access was closed for over a year when a sinkhole took out a chunk of the path, and as of the time of writing this review the beach is a major construction site due to a necessary rebuild of the seawall.)
Overall, I still recommend OceanAire to prospective tenants, but please make your decision based solely on the apartment itself, and not in the peripheral amenities which have become unreliable and consequently far less valuable.< /Text>< Time>

While considering a move to the area I was  recommended to check out this company. It's a beautiful area and Marisol was very helpful. Unfortunately work my work situation changed we are no longer moving up north, but we will diffidently keep it in mind in the future. Great place, totally worth checking out.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Oceanaire is beautiful. I’ve loved living there so much but 3 weeks after asking for my offer letter they sent me an offer for 6 months which was my current rent agreement at $300 more per month than what I pay currently. I begged them to keep my rent as close to the same price as possible and they declined recommending I sign a 15 month lease which is still close to $100 more per month than what I pay now. I’m heartbroken to leave but I’m not surprised that this is how they conduct business.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I had a short term lease this past summer while working at SFO.  Zee was the first person I met when checking out the place, and her sunny attitude matched the beautiful day.  The next three months were a gift of summer on the beach, unmarred by any element at Oceanaire.  Stopping in the office with any questions, or just to say Hi to Gina was always a pleasant and helpful occasion, even when it was to ask when the spa would re-open (it’s closure was not uncommon).  Maintenance staff was always ready to help with any of my requests to borrow a screwdriver for a minute, due to the fact I had left all my tools at home in the Valley.
Upon terminating my contract, a snag came up regarding term and dates, which Michael efficiently resolved with no complications.  Thankfully, nothing cast a shadow on a perfect summer stay.
Thanks Crew!
P.S.  Ask Zee for tips on hiking and biking trails in the area.</text>

I moved in towards end of 2017 and Mike, Marisol, & Veronica have been great. They really try to accommodate every request and are not rigid when it comes to maintaining rules.

If only the maintenance person who updates tickets were as accommodating. They tend to hurry past requests without thinking of the tenant.</Review>

My significant other and I have been viewing and touring apartments around the Peninsula and San Francisco. We scheduled a tour to view this amazing property because of the proximity to the beach and the ocean views.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by Zee, the assistant manager. She was friendly, upbeat and gave us a thorough tour. She discussed what future events and improvements they're planning to do and you can hear how much she truly cares about making the experience at OceanAire better. By far, she is the only person we've had a tour with that has made us feel right at home.

Thank you so much Zee! We both thoroughly enjoyed our tour of OceanAire apartments and absolutely can not wait to move in!</Review>

Hello about 4 months ago I was literally kicked out of the spa while using it with a friend, since the spa never worked is always under maintenance, but now answer me what kind of maintenance is this that lasts months and months?  the worst management i have ever had the displeasure to deal with, this is misleading advertising, show on the website that the spa is one of the things the condo offers however this is not true i want to know what day the spa will definitely be open to  residents or I will seek my rights, we do not pay so expensive to be injured</Text>

I visited this property while relocating from Houston. The view is amazing and the property is small and intimate. Zee was so friendly and professional. She helped make me less anxious about my big move by talking to me on a personal level. I decided to go with something less expensive, but this place is definitely still on my radar.</review>

< review>
I've been at OceanAire longer than most; four years in November. Over the years the community has had its ups & downs - most noticeably when it underwent major construction for about a year (which drove many of the negative reviews online). They've made some great positive changes since then, most notably in management of the community. This remains a really nice place to live - quiet, comfortable, and with an ideal location right on the ocean. The staff are terrific. They are highly responsive and the maintenance team is the best (particular shoutouts to Mike, Zee, and Omar).
With that said, lately I've been disappointed with the amenities that OceanAire promotes front & center on their website as a value-add to residents. That lovely spa that you see on the home page? Hasn't worked for months; basically all summer. The fitness center? Machines are frequently broken or not properly maintained, and bizarrely there is a personal trainer running her business out of it all day which monopolizes the equipment. Be careful investing too much value in the beach access, because this part of the coastline experiences major erosion, which means restoration efforts need to happen which block or disrupt that access. (The access was closed for over a year when a sinkhole took out a chunk of the path, and as of the time of writing this review the beach is a major construction site due to a necessary rebuild of the seawall.)

<review>There is no wheelchair accessible route to the office. The whole property is on a hill, and finding paths that don't have stairs is a challenge. Wooden hand rails are regularly covered in mist and sand due to proximity to the coast. This makes them gross to touch and hard to grip. Thicker boards are often used instead of a pole that's easy to get a grip on.</review>< user>

I have lived in one of their corporate apartments for about 3 months.  I have enjoyed my stay here.  My one bedroom apartment interior is nice and spacious for an older apartment.  Currently, the complex is undergoing a much needed major exterior renovation.  I believe once completed, the building exterior will look very nice.   Just be aware, if you visit right now, be prepared for major construction side effects (dust, mold, glass insulation, trash and noise).    This complex has the potential to be very nice within the next 6 months.   Current state, I would rate 2 stars.< /Text>

What a disappointment to live and be in this place from day number 1 to date, I have had many complaints so much so that last night we had to call the police to take care of a neighbor with loud music, now  When I get up this morning we receive calls from the neighbor above threatening and treating us in the worst way, I do not see the day I can end my contract in this place and leave, money lost when living here the place is very beautiful but it is definitely not a good place  To live with your dogs and have a quiet life I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR FAMILIES.< /Review>

<review>I wish the management were more proactive to address noise issues, again middle of the day on a weekend and the upstairs neighbor is blasting music, contacted the office by email and called but the answer is they can't contact the tenant at the moment and the patrol service paid my each tenant don't start to work until 7 and all I get is "sorry for the inconvenience" and the community website doesn't have the noise complaint option anymore< /review>< Date>

<Text>I've lived here for a very long time, and the management has changed many times. But the current management has been wonderful. Everyone in the office has been extremely polite and helpful. As for the buildings, they must have been constructed very well… I rarely hear anything through the walls. I have lived in many apartment buildings and the sound level here is by far the best.</Text><userid>100374920294605530173<//userid><rating>5</rating></record>

I moved to Oceanaire Apartments because my house was damaged in a fire. The apartment was so nice and clean and well cared for. Quiet and warm during the months of cold weather. The staff was terrific - so helpful and understanding. Helped to make a traumatic situation much easier for me.</Review>

{'time': 1508971616643, 'text': 'I’m sorry to hear you are having a bad experience here at Oceanaire with the construction taking place. Please note that we sent a memo to all residents back in June 2017 informing residents of the construction projects taking place. We followed up with a second memo informing each building of the dates that construction would take place and things to expect or prepare for. We have communicated via email and posted letters to ensure everyone is informed every step of the way. These are necessary projects for the betterment of the property and are not something we could have delayed any longer. We hope you will enjoy the remodeled fitness center and resident clubhouse. Please stop by the office to notify us of your keys that are not working so we may address these issues immediately. We are more than happy to schedule a time for you to come in to discuss your concerns. As of the last few months, we have not issued any rent increases. Please let us know if there is anything else we may do to further assist you.'}</Response>

<Text>I've lived here for 2+ years and used to sing praises of the place. I was told that the same management company was kept on after the property was sold and renamed from LandsEnd to OceanAire. However, with all that's going on it's surprising how poorly everything is being handled. As a side note, the beach access - one of the reasons we chose to live here has not been fixed for almost a year now.

CONSTRUCTION: So far, it's been a very poor experience. There's dust, noise, and construction items everywhere. We were given 3 days notice to move all of our patio furniture off during construction with no place to put it all. We were told that, for our specific building, it would be worked on for 2 months and to "keep your curtains drawn to ensure privacy.  Crews will be working at the windows and on balconies with visual access to your home." It's odd that they wouldn't finish 1 building at a time. Much of the parking (including street parking) has been taken over by construction vehicles and building materials. Multiple times, they've also had people enter our apartment for cabling related to the construction. We are given notice, but in reality, what choice do we have if we are not home and prefer that people do not enter? Today is supposed to be the final day of construction; however, the painting is still in progress. It's not going to complete within the deadline they've informed us of.

OFFICE MANAGEMENT: They will make no reasonable accommodations for any of the inconveniences, have no power to do so, and will not point you to people that can help. Our rent continues to increase. Our keys do not work for community shared spaces, and we were told by other apartment renters that we have to get our keys reprogrammed. There's a couple of stoic and rude office staff (with an exception or 2). You eventually give up since it's uncomfortable to list concerns to people that don't care and cannot help.

We still currently live in the complex due to the community of friends that have moved here with us. All 8 of which, not surprisingly, have had their own unhappy apartment issues. My hope is that the management company or owners really take into account what our community members are saying and make an effort to reasonably accommodate for issues. Currently, it just feels like existing apartment renters are being punished for staying here, try to voice concerns, but are faced with stoicism and an "unfortunately, it is what it is" attitude.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Before it changed its name and owner, this place was called Land's End Apartment Homes. Back then, it was a great place to live under the management of Joe and Shelley. After they left, the management team kept changing every few months. I even stopped by the office today and learned the team has been overhauled again(4th time in 6 months). Needless to say, this high turnover rate has made getting anything done impossible. Communication has been terrible as well. The bigger issue may be that they found a sinkhole 100 feet from the property, making it dangerous and blocking access to the beach, which is the essentially the best amenity at this place. With all these unexpected and unpleasant changes, I made the decision to move out.
After reading some of the other reviews, I'm noticing people are saying that the walls and floors are really thin here. Having lived only on the top floor units, I can't really relate to that. One thing that does get loud are the in-unit laundry machines. They are incredibly loud.

UPDATE(11/01/2017): I just read the response from the owner and the suggestion that they "have been in constant communication" with me is not authentic. I was never contacted about it. Ultimately, I posted my review after I moved out so there was nothing to be done. That said, I have been told that there is a new management team and new updates to the units taking place, so I can't speak for current state of the apartments here.

UPDATE(03/01/2018): I have been contacted by a number of current residents asking if I'd be willing to provide information on incidents where the management was dishonest about the state of apartments and facilities, possibly to take action legally. It seems even the current residents are experiencing lingering issues with the management team. Disappointed to hear that things have continued to deteriorate at this place.<//Review>

Before moving in, we were assured by management that the construction in our area was complete. As a night shift nurse, this was important to me. Unfortunately they lied. As I tried to sleep during the day, I would be awakened by loud banging literally on the other side of my bedroom wall. I reached out to management multiple times without response, including my mention that my patient’s lives were in my hands and it was dangerous that I wasn’t sleeping. They refused to work with me in any way. The building itself is poorly constructed. For example, I couldn’t be blow drying my hair in the bathroom and using the toaster in the kitchen at the same time without all of the power in the apartment going out. We had mice despite paying for pest control. The garage that I parked in had a door that rarely worked. I could really go on and on about the issues we had in the short 7 months that we lived there. Definitely wouldn’t recommend this complex for anything long term as the cliff is eroding quickly and it is pretty clear these apartments will be in the ocean in the next few years. Last thing- they reached out to us constantly trying to get positive google reviews. I have a feeling that many of these 5 Star reviews may have been incentivized.<//text></record>

What an amazing place! I've been interviewing in the Bay area and was looking for places and came upon this amazing complex. The location and the place were both great as was the staff (thanks Zee and Llana!), if I get the job I have a top pick of places to live. Thanks again Zee and Llana!< /review>

The office staff, a few in particular, have a way of dismissing you as the only one with an issue, when that's far from the truth. I have rented in most major cities in California due to my profession, and this is the only place I've ever had issues with like these.
This apartment doesnt command even the half of the rent it advertise about..

Pathetic and infested with many pests.

better stay away from such corporatized apartments homes.<//Text>

We lived there for about 9 months and had to move for a job out of state.  The view is unbelievable and nearly all year round you can see whales, dolphins, sea lions, pelicans & more right from your apartment!  The only issues we had were that the garbage disposal broke, the fridge was shutting off and on & the dryer wasn't drying very well, but they resolved all of the issues quickly.  Some reviews complained about the washer/dryer combination machine not drying well, but the filter has to be cleaned every few months, so simply put in a work order and the dryer will work great after being cleaned.  The complex itself is a little older and we can often hear our neighbors upstairs, but we would definitely continue to live here if we were staying in Pacifica.  It is clean, safe and very peaceful.  It is very close to Safeway, good restaurants and Hwy 1.  It was also nice to have a gym, jacuzzi & clubhouse that I could walk to in less than a minute.  The price for the SF Bay Area is reasonable; you will pay about what you'd pay in many other apt. complexes in the area but this one is right on the ocean!  But nothing's perfect...you will not get all of your security deposit back; you will have to pay for carpet shampooing, repainting, apartment cleaning, etc. when you move out.</text>< user_id>

The good:
1) The location is absolutely incredible. We saw whales, seals and dolphins frequently and got to go down to the beach every day. My fiancé and I as well as our dog loved that very much. Pacifica is such an awesome town in the bay that isn’t too far from the city.
2) Office staff is friendly.

The bad: phew...here it goes...
1) They will squeeze every penny out of your security deposit possible. There was one ding in our wall, about 3/4 inch in diameter and we got charged $150 for painting. We also spent the entire day cleaning and shampooing the carpets before we moved. The place looked pristine, yet we still got hit with a $150 charge for apartment cleaning and $95 for carpet cleaning. I’m sure Trinity will respond with a justification for this, however it was an unethical move regardless...as our apartment was beyond acceptable for the next resident’s move in.
2) Mice! You’ll be charged monthly for pest control, yet the pests are far from controlled around Oceanaire. We saw mice as well as their feces in and around our apartment frequently.
3) Very long response times to maintenance requests. Expect about a week min to get something scheduled (not completed, scheduled). I also informed the office about a cable being broken on the smith machine in the community gym. They did nothing for 3 weeks, then their next action was to put an out of order sign on it that says “we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused” rather than fixing the broken equipment. I’d estimate that 50-75% of the emails that come from the office end with that same note...”we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused” rather than addressing the root cause of the issues on hand. Proactive VS reactive management. Last, the emergency maintenance line was non-functioning both times I needed it which was brought to management’s attention. I am not sure if that has been resolved, but it doesn’t change the fact that it happened.
4) Electricity issues. If you use two things simultaneously that draw a lot of power, expect a short. We couldn’t use the following things at the same time: microwave, hairdryer, toaster, washer/dryer. Simply very old electrical wiring throughout property.
5) Many of the apartments will likely be at the bottom of the cliff within the next 5 years, less if the impending earthquake hits. The sea cliff erosion at this location is a real threat.</Review>

I placed $100 deposit for an apartment. They told me that if I decide to choose other places within 3 days,  I can have the refund. It has been half a month since I told them I canceled my appointment and I still did not receive my deposit. I called the management. She said she might need several days to check the system about this issue. I don't know when they would call me back.< /Review>

We are certainly understanding of the inconvenience this project may have caused our residents but this work is for the betterment of the property.

<review>this whole place is a permanent construction site - they're ALWAYS fixing something, because something ALWAYS needs to be fixed, and apparently it's ALWAYS the outside walls of my apartment that need to be fixed! noise, shouting, pounding, hammering and lost sleep for days on end - unbelievably annoying< /review><gmapID>0x808f7b754356e2c1:0xfb38a4865087515a</gmapID>< user_name>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is very comforting, you enjoy tranquility, the cold weather most of the time, it is unique, you meditate, you exercise with yourself (or), you enjoy the surroundings and especially the sea.

Though I haven't been able to frequent T.O.T as much as I would like, it's always a treat at this small restaurant when I can visit. My main meal is the delicious Sukiyaki Donburi. Just sweet and savory enough. But what cemented my love of this place even more is that one evening, pre quarantine, a small older Asian woman who was unhoused came to the front inside the restaurant. Immediately, a security officer came in to physically remove her, and as I was starting to object and inform them that I was getting her food, the server came out with a bag of food for her and let the officer know she was okay to be there.  Upon getting her meal she simply left. I could tell this older lady came from time to time as the servers had already started making something. So this place is just a lovely one, great cozy Atmosphere for dates or friendly gatherings. They seem to help their community and I miss being close enough through work to go often.</Text>

This place is great and I don't understand why the rating's so low. Bowls are around $16 (plus tax and tip), they don't have an obscenely long line like their neighbor Marafuku does, they bring the food out quickly, the broth is so good, and their noodles are super yummy. Portions are generous too.< /Review>

<Review>The food was amazing! The chicken ramen is worth being fat! The service was outstanding, and the interior of the restaurant has Avery authentic look to it. Accompany all this with an Orion beer, and it makes you feel like you're in Okinawa. Great place!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Love this place. Food is excellent and service is quick whether you order in or out. Came in to order the usual dry fried chicken, shrimp & leek dumpling and string beans. The order was ready in 15 mins. Even though they were extremely busy. If you haven't been, don't ask questions, just go!!<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Randomly chose this spot for a late Sunday lunch. Was not disappointed at all. Greeted promptly at the door. Clean  with local art for sale on the walls. I love a place that supports local artists. The Menu had plenty of choices with photos. It all looked wonderful. My friend and I decided to share the seaweed salad, Gyoza, cream cheese wontons, miso soup, and Salmon with mixed tempura entree.  Definitely enough for two. It was all delicious. The miso broth had such good flavor. The tempura was delicately crispy, nice. The Salmon was on point. The gyoza and wontons did not disappoint. Well worth a visit and I will return. Thank you TOT.<//Review>

I've always walked past this place, but on the recommendation of friends gave it a try. Good service and the food did not disappoint. Will definitely try some of their other donburi bowls next time I'm in the area.<//Text>

It's right across the street from the Expo line station. It's easy to get to, either by train, or driving, and it's always worth the trip.

The couple that run the place is very friendly and will reward repeat customers. Their food is top quality. Their naan is choice. And they're always happy to see you.</text><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>Service was good, we felt welcome when we enter the restaurant. We ordered a ramen and a lunch set. The ramen was alright, not exactly as good as the one I had in Japan, but still tasted good. Sashimi in the lunch set was fresh. Overall tasting: above average. If you are driving, you can park at the Japanese village parking lot, remember to validate your parking ticket after you eat, you will have two hours free parking.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWTbbpRft_GaRv5fwNGLwHphyLNkLZx8S9mt_D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl_Nr7J5EplozXuT_GMICRbfH-lrvxuC77VCo1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbeUEKF9iK2Kg6nl4APDna5bXjcOnja3CA-uba=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMavlnR7hROmrDFY00XN-VxaLxsR0nT4U6AKEvp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqTd-WJ3qGqSlQJ2jtprqXa_o4h0tG0yQkX4O5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_foQpyB5LunSS4LQWHgF23f2hDrHLpeShEjFX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOumIjk-pBmZzYuGLzNnuzPw_hREG_f9TQtHePv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
I really love their katsu! It’s so crispy, without being too oily. Their croquettes are also super yummy, the crabs ones are very creamy but the potato has lots of flavour too! The cheese Katsu is a bit too cheesy for me, but my friends really like it and it looks very novel.<//Review>

Love this place. I frequent here often since i work down the street. Love the staff, they are sooooo sweet. They always have delicious food and offer early bird special- $1 off before noon. I always crave their food and have to come back regularly! I definitely suggest stopping by if you're in the area!<//Text>

<text>We came it right before the lunch rush and was seated in a nice booth by the kitchen.  I had not eaten yet so I was very ready for food.

Skimmed the menu and everything looked appetizing.  Lunch Bento caught my eye since I really couldn't make up my mind, was too hungry to think.  The salmon teriyaki gozen, includes appetizer, rice (choice of white or brown - I chose brown), miso soup, and salad.  Appetizers vary.  Today's appetizers included:  fresh tofu topped with green veggie and miso sauce, veggie tempura with grated daikon, few slices of sashimi on a bed of daikon and fresh pickled ginger (YUM!), and zaru soba (just the right amount to enjoy without getting full).  WOW what a bento box!  Price $16.50.  Very reasonable for the feast that was presented.

The salmon teriyaki was grilled to perfection.  And tasted really good with a mouthful of brown rice.  Tempura was crunchy good.  Sashimi was fresh.

Husband ordered the sashi gozen.  And he really enjoyed it!

We both had Sapporo draft.  Washed all the food down well.

Service was good.  And we were lucky to have gotten there just before the rush so lunch was served very timely.

Top 3 ramen I've ever tried. This is a little hidden ramen gem. Walking into this place I wasn't expecting much but after ordering food we were blown away. I've never tried the Nagoya-style ramen but it was super delicious, the broth seems to be tomato based, the noodle perfect, loaded with meat, and fresh leeks and herbs to top it off. It all combined for the perfect bowl of ramen. The sushi here was great too. A huge plus is that while all the other popular sports were packed with an hour wait to sit down, we walked right into this place, sat down, and had our food withing a half hour. I was really impressed and I believe you will be too< /text>

Quaint & cozy little place with a large menu featuring donburi bowls, udon and classic Izakaya dishes.  Parking structure right across the street. Great place to grab a quick bite before cruising and shopping around the plaza of little Tokyo.< /Review>

Took 2 cousins and the 3 of us loved our food and drinks.  I had the fresh lemonade, aburi salmon, some gyoza, and a miso soup.  We ended up sharing our food just to show each other how good it all was. People were very polite, as expected, and service was entirely wholesome and attentive.  I would gladly return with more friends soon.< /review>

A favorite place of ours in Little Tokyo. A few good sushi selections, but mostly we love it for its traditional staples of Japanese cuisine I remember from living there. Donburi bowls, fried cutlets, etc. I will definitely bring my family when they are in town; it will remind them of our time there.< /Text>

<text>We have yet to go to a bad restaurant in Little Tokyo.  Maybe because we research the location first?  Great food.  No real complaints, though I didn't get a refill on my water until the end of our meal -- it was a hot freaking day, i was going to an outdoor music festival; I'm a fairly big guy and I absolutely need LOTS of water.  I'd like to emphasize that the food was excellent.  :)< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I loved the agedashi tofu as an appetizer! I also ordered the sukiyaki donburi with a raw egg. It was great portion, I even had enough to take home. Definitely better than fast food places such as Yoshinoya, however, it was bit  too pricey.

Also, the area (Little Toyko Japanese Plaza) is great to walk around afterwards to explore or even get dessert afterwards. I had no issues with parking in the garage with validation.< /Text>

The food is absolutely fantastic (I had the millefeuille pork with cheese). However, the restaurant is understaffed (I was there on a Tuesday Night), and the servers were overwhelmed.
Absolutely worth a try, but note that you'll have to mind your server.</Text>

<Text>Still one of our favorite places in Little Tokyo. Hot sake, salmon teriyaki and spicy chicken bowl are our go-tos. Yoko has been there forever and there's a quick turnaround and seating is pretty quick. Happy eating!< /Text><user_name>Ailene Michel< /user_name>< time>

A great little lunch and dinner place with a friendly, familiar atmosphere. A fairly simple, authentic menu of Japanese cuisine. A favorite stop of mine when visiting Little Tokyo.< /text>

<text>Food and service were great as always but, constantly changing menu makes it difficult to order my favorites. It's almost to the point where I have to order my favorites al a cart. It's a minor complaint since they are always willing to accommodate.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c647fbdb7465:0x95a6abac0c1ada9f< /Gmap_id><Name>Sean Mocabee</Name>< userid>

The food was great and the staff were very polite . Would highly recommend to try eating there if you're new to Little Tokyo. All in all, it was one of the many great highlights in my trip to Little Tokyo.<//review>

<Review>T.O.T. Ramen is a nice refreshing take on this classic dish. Ground pork provides plenty of texture while the broth really takes a hold of your taste buds. It was reminisce of Mexican Menudo. Their half lemonade and half ice tea is delicious.

I would recommend you get the extra noodle just because it is satisfying slurping those bad boys down. If you're a fan of ramen it is a must try!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>Barely standard service, bland tasting food. I was expecting food that was worth the price but it was just overpriced and had no flavor. I left there not being able to finish my food not because it was too much but because the food had such I basic flavor that I didn't care anymore. I do not recommend this place to anyone ever.</Review>< resp>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) For dinner on June 27th (Wednesday), head to T.O.T. in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles.

After eating, I learned the meaning of T.O.T from the receipt, but it seems to be an abbreviation for Teishokuya of Tokyo.

First of all, toast!

Orion (Imported from OKINAWA) $ 8.75
It seems that they are imported all the way from Okinawa.

And here is the order from the menu.

Millefeuille Shiso Cheese Cutlet (Katsu Only) $ 17.50

Since there is beer, you can use the cutlet separately without a rice set.

Mille-feuille pork cutlet pork and shiso are filled with cheese. It is a cheese that spreads like pizza cheese.

You can enjoy the freshly scented sesame seeds if you do it yourself. Please match the sauce there.

The sauce of sesame and mustard goes well with the freshly fried cutlet.

The shop has all kinds of Japanese food, but I chose the Millefeuille pork cutlet at the entrance and it was the correct answer.

Thank you for your feast (^_^)

6月27日(水)の夕食は、ロサンゼルスのリトルトーキョーにあるT.O.T へ。

食後に、T.O.Tの意味をレシートで知ったのですが、Teishokuya of Tokyo の略だそうです。

まずは乾杯！

Orion (Imported from OKINAWA)　$8.75
はるばる沖縄から輸入しているようです。

そして、メニューの中からオーダーしたのはこちら。

Millefeuille Shiso Cheese Cutlet (Katsu Only)　$17.50

ビールがあるので、ご飯セット無しの、カツ単品に。

ミルフィーユトンカツの豚と紫蘇の間から、トロッとしたチーズが流れ出します。ピザのチーズ並みにのび～るチーズです。

届いた胡麻は、自分ですると、すりたての香りも楽しめます。そこにソースを合わせていただきます。

揚げたてのカツに胡麻と辛子を合わせたソースがよく合います。

和食全般の品があるお店ですが、入口にあったミルフィーユトンカツを選んで正解でした。

ごちそうさまでした(^_^)</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Japanese food here was delicious! After all, miso soup was thankful! ! The sashimi was also fresh and the buckwheat noodles were crispy, and the tempura had a slightly stiff impression of shrimp, but they can be eaten without problems. Pumpkin and sweet potato tempura were also delicious. The price is about 1,500 yen, but I think it is worth going if you miss Japanese food.

(Original)
ここの和食は美味しかったです！なんと言っても味噌汁がありがたかった！！刺身も鮮度良かったし、そばはコシがあって、天ぷらはエビが少し硬めな印象でしたが問題なく食べられます。かぼちゃとさつまいの天ぷらも美味しかったです。値段は1500円くらいからですが、日本食が恋しくなったら行く価値はあると思います。< /Text>< userid>

<review>(Translated by Google) Sushi from regular to bad, terrible presentation. The very correct attention and the very pleasant place but being the Little Tokyo the truth that the sushi was a disappointment. The photos that are published as a cover are from the next door Hama Sushi that unfortunately was closed when we went. So don't get carried away by the photos.

Sushi de regular a malo, pésima presentación. La atención muy correcta y el lugar muy agradable pero estando el Little Tokio la verdad que una decepción el sushi. Las fotos que están publicadas como portada son del local de al lado Hama Sushi que lamentablemente estaba cerrado cuando fuimos.

We called the day before and was able to get an appointment the next day and the help was quick and service was great. Best part, we didn't have to pay a single penny.

I used to take my dad's car there before he passed away. I have also taken my mother's car there before she stopped driving. And I've always taken my car there. they give me good service quick service and good prices. I will continue to do business with them until other people about them. and I love the fact that when you get a flat tire they take care of you. Most of the time with no charge. I would recommend them to everyone. oh my goodness though I don't want everybody to go there because then I won't get that quick service don't go there.lol</Review>

<text>America's Tire has always treated me good here at the Napa store. Way back when they did a deal on just 1 tire for me until payday so I could drive to and from work(Trader Joe's)for the next week. Then I was able to do the 4 tire deal. They have helped co-workers on their tire repairs as well with plugs, valve stems and with great deals too. And not everyone was a previous customer. I do live in Napa yet they were across the street from my old store. I have purchased my 3rd set of tires from the Napa store today because they treated me good in a hard time in the past as also some friends.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Tried to make an appointment because its a pretty far drive. Yet guy on the phone insisted we didnt need an appointment and we can just come right in and be taken care of. Got there at 3:30 and of course its a 2 hour wait. Im now sitting waiting with a 7 month old for 2 hours to get tires balanced. Clown show.</Text>

<review>Did a good job on my F150. David was great. Only advice to management would be to call once vehicle is ready, and give a quick clean of the wheels. There was a lot of yellowish lube residue on the  wheels from mounting. But overall a good experience. I would recommend!< /review><Rating>4< /Rating><Date>1597773985009<//Date><username>Dario</username><Pics>None< /Pics>< user>

<Review>Been going to America's tire for years. They are fast in installation of tires (with appointment you may wait 45 minutes for all tires to be installed). Good prices and discounts/ specials. If you're just needing tires installed, this is the place to go.<//Review>< Time>

They patched my tire for free. They were all very nice and had me in and out quick. They gave me a quote for tires in the front and it was very reasonable. I will definitely be back.<//review>

The tires were not unsafe in any way due to the small degree of wear. This was a  blatant scare tactic to sell new tires and I caution Americas Management that it is very discouraging to see a   great company use such shoddy and fraudulent sales method.

I was impressed by the great customer service. From the phone call I made to the time I left the store. I bought two new tires which they installed. Then they rotated all my tires and pulled and patched two nails without my even asking and at no extra charges. Very impressed!<//text>

I was going to work this morning and my low tire pressure light came on.  I pulled into America's Tire just as they opened.  They got me in, confirmed I had a nail in my tire.  The staff is super friendly and professional and they had me back on the road in less than an hour.  I will definitely be going back when I need a new set of tires.< /Text>< user_name>

Making an appointment was a part of the check out process and they call you with a reminder about it the week of. The installation of two tires was expected to be 45 minutes but they texted me in 25. Great work guys and gals.< /Review>< Pictures>

Tires never came in after 2 weeks.  When i ordered another tire and came for an appointment to replace my previous order the tires i ordered were defective.  The manager of the store Brennan compensated me for the time i waited for the new tires to come in with a very sincere discount for the problems i encountered. With that said every thing went well and i have a good set of tires with a very good discount.  This tires shop live up to their words....they will never fail you .......I strongly recommend this shop! very clean and professional people.

I came in with a slow leaking tire and they would have fixed free of charge but they showed me how worn the tire was and how they couldn’t repair it. Turns out all my tires were in the same condition. I decided to have all 4 replaced since I was about to drive 8 hours. They gave several options with a good warranty. I was so glad they had the tires I wanted in stock. They were professional, knowledgeable and very helpful!</Review>

Awesome Tires so I went for it. Well worth it. Go see these guys and they will point you in the right direction.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Could not be happier with the service I received. I got two new tires at a price that was very fair.  As I sat there in the waiting lounge sipping a warm cup of complimentary coffee I attempted to write  a short email , but I got cut short because my car was already done.  Absolutely satisfied with the very friendly staff, and I was in and out.  No complaints.  Thanks guys</Text>

Bought my tires here a few months back and the service was good. Today I got a nail in one of my tires.They repaired my tire free of charge. Thank you! It is terrible getting a nail hole in your tire but when they came through with the free repair of my tire it made it a little less stressful. Thanks again. Will buy next tires here. I recommend buying tires at America's tire. Thanks again.<//Text>

< review>
Got a flat off-roading in Knoxville and literally not a single tire repair store was open on the weekend in any of these small towns. Called and told these guys it’d take an hour and a half to get there, which would put us right at closing. They said no problem, that they’d make sure we were taken care of and that was the truth! Got there just before 5 and the whole thing took 30 mins max. Super nice guys, service fees much cheaper than other places we’ve been ($19 for one tire). Super convenient, highly recommend!< /review>

<Name>Kayla Smith</Name><pics>None</pics><Time>1488303811334<//Time><review>Long story short, I noticed my flat tire first thing in the morning, had no idea why it was flat.  America's tire was right next door so I drove it over.  I dropped off my vehicle because of the wait. 2 hours later, they called to say all 4 of my tires needed to be replaced.  I said no.  They said they're very old, very poor quality, and they will not fix the 1 tire because it is pulling apart and too dangerous to fix.  I said my tires are only 1 year old and from Costco.  They changed their story, 2 tires were new, and 2 were old and needed to be replaced.  They had no spares to sell.  Their cheapest tire that could get me to a Costco was $175.  Then I asked how much to replace the 2 back tires.  They said they only had 1 tire similar quality to the Bridgestone I had on the front, and that would cost $140... So why was that option cheaper when I asked which was the cheapest tire...  So I told them I'm not the car owner, it's officially my parents, here is my dad's phone number.  20 minutes later, no one had called my dad so I had him call the shop.  Rather than lie to my dad, they fixed up the tire that was previously deemed "dangerous and irreparable" and I went back and picked up my car.  While the mechanic/salesperson may have been correct in saying I needed new tires, they first tried to sell me 4 tires when 2 are still new, and then lied about the ability to fix my tire.  I do not plan on going back to an America's Tire.<//review>< Rating>

After working with Brendan I'll never go back to this place. I went here for years till It took them 3 months to replace a pair of wheels. They threw away the wheels when I went in to have tires  unmounted and discarded. He then tred to con me into buying a whole new set of wheels.</text>

<text>I got 2 tires a few months ago for 179 $ i know there was no deal i just went with the cheapest set. I only go to and from work really so i dont need rugged tires. i went back today to get the same or simmilar tires and now it has jumped in price 319!! I just feel like that is a crazy price diffrence. If i was not in need of tires badly i would wait untill monday and shop around that is for sure.<//text>< username>

good tires, great service, great price, I read reviews about repairing old tires..I have had old tires fail not only on my truck but on my bike (10 speed) they are correct in telling you to replace them, you can damage your car or yourself or even worse hurt or kill someone........buy new tires< /text>

Worst tire shop in Napa. Most unprofessional and inexperienced workers. You will see what I mean if you go here. Do not go here if you have a nice car you will differently regret it. I would give this place 0 stars if possible.</Text>

<Review>I have been going to Tri city vet for almost ten years now. Never had a problem just few minor mishaps. Ever since the pandemic the quality of their service has declined. Just recently I was 6 minutes late. I tried to call and the line was busy. I made it though and they told me they would be right out. They made me wait for 26 minutes before they chose to come out. By that time I had already left. They said since I was late they gave my spot to someone else. I feel they should’ve notified me that they had bumped my appointment. So the lady lectures me on being on time and pretty me I told me this was all my fault and charged me for the deposit. It is safe to say I’ll never go their again. She told me I was lucky they tried to fit me in anyways so paying the deposit  is justified. They could’ve told me my appointment had been changed. The manager was condescending and very judgmental. I don’t recommend for anyone to get involved with them. This isn’t the first time I’ve had to accept their treatment. They have always treated me differently I am just used to it . This time I was just over it.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1618339602211<//Time>< rate>

<time>1538495326532< /time><text>Tri-City Veterinary Clinic has been a part of my family's life for decades! This is the only Vet Clinic I truly trust for my furry "children". Dr. Porte and Dr. Pandi are geniuses when it comes to pet care and diagnosis. They also have no hesitation to get on the ground with your pet and love them.

One of the great values that sets TCVC apart from other clinics is their willingness to approach each issue with small, cost effective steps first. They don't recommend or perform outrageous, unneeded procedures until each less invasive and less costly treatment has been tried. This puts less stress on your pet and less stress on your wallet!

I recommend everyone I know and everyone I meet to visit Tri-City Veterinary Clinic. The staff is the most compassionate and caring as well. We Love TCVC!!!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dc71589a312057:0x5003a22c8258bc53</Gmap_id><rating>5<//rating><username>J H</username>< UserId.>

<Review>My dog requires prescription dog food and I was new to the area. No other Vet hospital would even talk to me they all wanted to charge me to examine my dog first. Tri-City went out of their way and contacted my Vet in Orange County and got the prescription information and sold me the food my dog was prescribed by my vet. I just went back for another bag recently and they treated me like they knew me and that says a lot in this crazy world and these crazy times. If your pet needs care I highly recommend if you're in Oceanside, Carlsbad or Encinitas and you need pet care that you bring your pet here.<//Review>< UserId.>

Dr. Porte is the best. We had to put our dog down 2 years ago. It was so tragic that we changed vets just to avoid the memory. After a year of using surfside for our new dog, I realized how much better Tricity veterinarian treated us and our baby. They are not the cheapest but you get what you pay for.<//Review>

< Review>
I enjoyed 4-5 years of great animal care from the staff at this clinic. It has been my first choice. Until yesterday.

Having had to make the unhappy choice of having to put down a dear dog due to heart issues, I had called ahead and specifically asked for an appointment to quickly put our small pet out of its suffering. The dog was a 15 lb chihuahua mix. I directly expressed my request for a quick procedure following our arrival several times telling them that we would have spent enough personal time with our pet privately before we arrived. I was given a late appointment so that there wouldn't be any scheduling delays, (I was told), and told that everything would be ready when we arrived.

I've had to put down a number of dear pets down before and it's no fun for anyone involved. But I know about how things should go. The expectation is for a peaceful and uneventful passing. Usually the vet administers a preliminary injection of tranquilizer to relax the animal, then a short time afterward an overdose of a powerful anesthesia that allows the tranquil animal to drift quietly off to a sleep from which they never awake.

In this case, we arrived and were shown into a private room that had been prepared appropriately. But that was where things started to go wrong. Dr Pandi was on duty, and came in with the anesthetic hypodermic in hand after a short wait. I had to ask for the preliminary injection; which was provided after several excuses and an additional delay. The tranquilizer injection was given and we were told that the Dr would be waiting just outside the door for us. After about 4 minutes the dog relaxed, but my wife had to chase down the Dr who was nowhere in sight. She finally came in and shaved a back leg to expose a vein into which she would insert the butterfly needle through which she was to inject the anesthesia. Apparently she missed the vein causing the dog to yip and jerk which pulled out the needle and pulled off the tube from the hypodermic. Then she shaved a front leg, successfully inserted the needle, and while the attendant fought to keep the tube attached administered what she said was enough anesthesia for a 40 lb dog. I expected the dog to drift off, but it kept struggling for breath. after several minutes it even struggled and whimpered. I said, "OH COME ON?! REALLY" The Dr gave some excuses about dogs with heart issues behaving differently. Our dog continued to struggle for breath. Finally she offered to give a third injection, and I answered, "PLEASE DO!"  So she left again, and finally returned with a third hypodermic. Then shaved a third leg and made the final injection, which worked after several minutes.

It would be a tragic mistake to redirect the grief of my loss into anger at the vet who facilitated it. I don't believe I am doing that here. My only reason for making this review is to alert others so that they will not have to go through the additional trauma we did in an already stressful and sad situation.< /Review>

Quality care.  No up selling or making you feel quilty if you don't,  or can't do all they suggest at the moment. Great techs and wait time is minimal.

Wouldn’t trust Max in any other hands.< /text>

Great personal service. Many other vets would have asked for expensive tests that we're proven to be unnecessary.</text>

DO NOT GO TO THIS VET!!!!!!! I took my dog here to get a simple shot and asked if we could go back they said no. Ok that’s fair and then I’ve never heard a dog scream like this before. The entire place you could hear her screaming. After it was continuing and getting louder we asked 3 more times before we walked into them strangling her with catchers pole and she was unable to breath. They were trying to muzzle her also. They riled her up so bad she POOPED HERSELF. There were also 7 people standing around the operating table.  This traumatized my dog and me and my husband. PLEASE SHARE THIS! If we hadn’t barged in they could have killed her. She also has injuries on her butt and back. Missing fur, eye sore, and her bottom is swollen. Her tail is twice as big! What did they do to my dog?</review>

Tri-city vet provides exceptional care for a reasonable cost. My dogs have been going to Dr Porte for 15 years. Dr Porte and Dr Pandi are excellent, knowledgeable, and compassionate doctors. They take their time to explain everything and never make you feel rushed. They entire office staff is wonderful. I highly recommend them.< /review>

<Review>On my first trip my cattle dog Eli had a type of Lupus. 3 other vets wanted to charge me over $600 alone for lab work with no guarantee of a result. Dr Porte spent more time visually inspecting the scabs than any other doctor. He felt he knew the cause of the growth and suggested a treatment, qualifying his opinion so I completely understood why he was treating Eli in the manner he prescribed. Next was a car accident which allowed me to experience a comforting Dr Porte, assuring me of the expected recovery. Dr Porte and Dr Pandi are simply the most caring veterinarians I have ever had the experience of dealing with. This is not a job for them, they truly love animals. Its rare to find this kind of quality care today at such fair prices.</Review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>My dad passed away when I was a child, so I have been coming to Chapel Of The Chimes for over 50 years. In 2017, I lost my beautiful mom and my brother. I visit here very often, because it gives me peace as I am still grieving. Lately, there has been an issue. When I place items along with flowers on my mom and dad’s combined niche, they are being taken.The first time this happened was Mother’s Day 2020, and has now happened 3 more times. I know the items are taken, because my sister or sister in law always put flowers for the holidays a few days after I do. Four times now, they have told me the items I put in the niche were gone when they went there. I just couldn’t believe that this keeps happening. I spoke to a staff member after this occurred after Easter this year and asked her about security or cameras. Denise, the staff member, very rudely told me they don’t have security and have no intention of adding security. I than spoke with the General Manager Cary, and told him the situation. I explained I understand if wilted flowers are removed from the staff, but other items should not be removed. Also, the quickness in which the flowers have been taken between my visits and my sisters, I don’t think the flowers would be wilted. Anyway, I told him that I didn’t think it was staff and that something else is happening here. He said he realizes it’s a metropolitan area and things will happen. He gave me lip service and said he would tell staff to watch out more. Now two weeks ago, for Morhers Day I placed flowers and a love you mom balloon and when my sister went there a few days later, everything I placed was gone yet again. I was livid at this point. I left a message over the weekend for Cary to call me, it is now Wednesday and I have not heard from him. The bottom line is that this staff does not give a damn! I have a call in to the newspaper to let them know about the lack of security at this beautiful, historical building.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I was a little worried going there my first time as I wasn't sure if it would seem disrespectful to come here just to look at the beautiful building, but it seems that visitors are welcome and the building is well worth a visit. Make your way up to the second story and you'll find a veritable labyrinth of rooms that only grows more serene and gorgeous the further you go in.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< gmapID>

<review>Had what appeared to be discrepancies on billing end.  Representative Cynthia Aguirre's professionalism and patience was refreshing indeed!  She went through great lengths to answer my questions and allay all of my concerns.  Good listener and determined to make everything clear.  Good service over the years by this storied company.< /review><rating>5<//rating>< gmap_id>

<date>1615495012797</date><review>I purchased a niche for my mom Nov 2019.  She passed of covid on January 12. Chapel of chimes told me that they had sold my moms niche. I have the deed. They offered another and eventually picked a new one. For weeks I was told that I would receive documents and quit claim to sign. Finally I had to talk to a supervisor on Feb 17 who told me the paperwork was at the main office. My mom arrived at chapel of the chimes on February 12.
When I finally received the documents and had the quit claim notarized I sent them back certified mail. They received them on March 1. I was told when they received them she would be placed. Well called on March 9. Told they are really busy and has not been placed. Then told this week. Well my mom has been there since February 12. This is so upsetting. She needs to be laid to rest. This has been the worst experience during a very hard time losing my mother.<//review><user_id>103519763852287446628< /user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My wife Patricia passed away and I used them to pick her up from the nursing home and staying there and To deliver her  to the grave site because of the good review and their price guarantee. To my shock that they wanted me to pay $4500 while Mt View Cemetery only charge $2400 for the same service, after we questioned, they only agreed to reduce by $780 , they are preying on the grieving family, I paid them but do not appreciate the way they conduct their business! I talked to the general manager, he said he’ll look into it, but never heard from him again!<//Review>

<review>This building is a hidden gem of the East Bay. It is a labyrinth of private nooks perfect for contemplation and remembrance. They welcome visitors both to admire the architecture, designed in part by Julia Morgan, as well as to memorialize their loved ones. Additionally, they host musical performances in conjunction with local arts groups that both feed the local culture and, I think, celebrate the residents.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My father and grandfather reside here, so I visit very regularly. The building itself is architecturally gorgeous, and it's a good place to walk around inside,  out of the heat/wildfire smoke. There is an ongoing issue with fruit flies which I have spoken to the staff about multiple times.
If they were better about the bugs, I'd give 5 stars without hesitation. Some of the rooms have skylights which can open. Unfortunately the skylights were open even with the severe wildfire smoke (at rating of unhealthy) but we easily avoided those rooms and it was a good place to get some steps inside for free.

Again, love the facility and the staff is kind during tough times, but minus one star for aggravating fruit flies in my Dad's area (Chapel of Light) and due to the fact that they had skylights open during unhealthy times.<//review>

<Text>My father recently passed from a heart attack, and because we have had past arrangements held here, we felt comfortable going with them. This complaint is not about the funeral directors or people who helped set up arrangements with us. Nicolette, and a lady named Mele, we very compassionate and professional. The best hospitality came from these two ladies. Everything we needed help or information for they were there to assist with urgency. However the supervisor, I don’t have his name but he’s a big tall guy is very rude. My family arrived to support my sister and I in mourning. Granted there were more people that showed up than what we expected but we were not thinking all of us can go inside given the current state of covid in California. While my family was out side the doors the manager came and was very rude to my family. Sir, you are in a business where people are mourning the death of loved ones, you could and should know who to handle things a lot better. This was very disappointing and as I walked out from seeing my father he looked at me with disgust. No hello, no greeting nothing. He yelled at my mother and told her she could not sit in the front of the chapel alone, keeping social distancing. I will inform the Tongan community of how we were treated by the head supervisor. Totally unprofessional and no regard for the situation which we’re currently dealing with. If you are brown, he will not be friendly.<//Text>< time>

If your a diehard raiders fan, and known about the greatest NFL legend like Al Davis, then this is the best place that everyone in the RaiderNation can pay their tribute and giving thanks for everything that he brought the best players, coaches, and even the members of the front office at the former team headquarters in Alameda California.<//text>

Trying to coordinate with Chapel of the Chimes has been a source of grief for my entire family. They dropped the ball multiple times after my dad's passing. It's been about four months since he's passed away and even though we paid for the service and the niche, his niche is still missing the name plaque. How is this possible? This is what they claim on their website but it's been the complete opposite experience for us: "At Chapel of the Chimes, we understand that losing someone you love is one of life’s most difficult experiences, and that’s why it’s so important to us that our clients feel like an extension of our own family. Our incredible team of professionals have many years of experience, and as we comfort families in times of loss, we work tirelessly to ensure they’re all treated with compassion and respect." We were not treated with compassion or respect, and they have caused us even greater grief due to their negligence.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>What an amazing place!  And the staff rivals the buildings for excellence.

I have been coming to the Chapel of the Chimes since I was just a small child.  It was always our favorite hangout to explore without those pesky adults hanging around - we made the place our playground and knew every nook and cranny (probably to the dismay of some adults who were just trying to have a quiet moment!).  It holds such a special place in my heart, not only from those childhood memories, but from recent experiences as well.

A few months ago, I decided that the time had come to make arrangements for my own "after-life" experience.  My mother, as well as many other relatives, had already been interred at the Chapel.  I was lucky to be directed to Ian Ho, who handled everything with professionalism.  He was also very patient as I went through the process of making various decisions, not the least of which was where my remains would be placed.  In the end, I not only decided that the Fountain of Integrity was the place for me, but also decided to remove my mother's urn from the chapel she was in and place it in the same niche that I will eventually occupy.  We also went through the procedure of having my mother's urn re-engraved so that my father's name and dates are also inscribed there (his ashes were scattered elsewhere, per his wishes).

Ian made everything easy for me and I cannot thank him enough.  When the time came for placement of my mother's/father's urn, both he and Matthew were so thoughtful and helpful.

I look forward to visiting the Chapel of the Chimes many times in the future!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place failed to get our  mother finger printed as promised and now we have no way of getting the keepsake finger print tag. We also begun to question everything that was suppose to have been done . We never got her old clothes and we don't know what happened to the new ones we brought them. We were lied to about the finger prints,  from Jaguar and Victoria Bell. This started 12/17/2018 and we still have yet to get any response concerning the finger prints, today. We have no idea if our Mother was the one that was cremated, without prints and not getting the clothes back. It's hurtful and we are devastated. Just tell us the TRUTH! Would not  recommend this place for anyone of melinated skin. I'm hearing other cases of foul play concerning the departed and the survivors.  No closure and added more pain to our grieving.  Chapel of the chimes treated us horribly. At this time my family and I are very happy with the immediate response from the owner concerning the issues we had with this Chapel. RESOLVED!
It's not often that a company Director reaches out and respond to disgruntled customers to make sure they are put back whole and resolve their issues.  This has happened and we are more than satisfied with the empathy  and compassion that Mr. Williams has shown us and has now given us closure for the past situation. For that, five stars are given.<//Review><UserId.>112361112919291875171<//UserId.><time>1550699689307< /time><Response>{'time': 1547590365890, 'text': 'We are deeply sorry for the loss of your mother and we are so sorry to hear about your experience.

It was not a good experience during our time of grief. Me and my sister went to make arrangements for my mom on Monday December 17th. When we got home she had passed away 20 min later. We called all everyone that needed to be called, she was picked up that night. All was good up to that time.
We had our services, great. We were told  the cremation process would be 10 days, we asked about her finger print to be done for special process that requires them. 10 days later she was not cremated and no one notified us. We had made plans for a destination disposal NONREFUNDABLE, No apology was given, to add insult to injury no one could verify if the finger print was done. Instead Victoria told my sister Jaquar was new and dropped the ball, instead of looking into the situation. I had called and left a message still no response from Victoria... We finally got the Urn/remains on January 5,2019 with still no apology for my experience.
My feelings were not only hurt but I am unable to get my closure from my mother's death. I am truly hoping my treatment was not because I am Afro American..... I should have been made to feel less than human, like my mom and our grieving process did not matter as we me and my sister left phone calls and messages to get no response until my sister left her review and was asked to change the content to further add more pain to our grieving process......😢</text>

What an escape this is! So silent, and endless spaces to wander through. There are sun rooms, water fountains, beautiful plants. This is a very, very special place for those who don't mind kicking it with the deceased.< /Text>

I highly recommend Chapel of The Chimes, the entire facility is just beautiful!  The staff were so wonderful. Really want to thank Marlo McKelvy and Ron Maloney for going above and beyond accommodating my family and friends and I. The two of them are so professional.  Will highly recommend Chapel of The Chimes. 👍 Great Job!</Review>

I had been going to another nail salon in San Marcos because the young lady who had been doing my nails for over 20 years moved to that salon and it was close.  After putting up with the owners double booking or trying to squeeze in a walk in prior to my nail appointment I had enough.  What is the sense of making an appointment and then waiting 15 - 20 minutes to get my nails done.  No I am sorry - nothing.  One day I just got up and left.  I decided to try Fantabulous Nails.  OMG what a wonderful place - they are always on time, clean and professional.  Nancy has now been doing my nails for well over a year and never a problem.  The product is of good quality.  During these trying times with closures at any time - my nails lasted 10 weeks before one finally broke.  I get regular fills and was so surprised that they last that long with a chip or break.  I type every day so this was a miracle.  Thank you Nancy!  Try them you will love them and many places to park.<//text>

I showed her a picture of what I wanted and wow... I definitely didn’t get what I asked for. The lines in the design I got were very messy and not clean at all. The paint job is uneven and my nails are a bit bumpy and there are several bubbles. Overall, very poorly done.<//text>

Absolutely a great and relaxing experience. The ladies there made sure I was really happy with my nail color and nail length. The foot and hand massage were exactly what I needed after a long week of holiday prep. Highly recommend.<//review>

I have a great experience with this place.  List a hidden gem within a few blocks from my home.   Diane did my nails and they were beautiful. I feel bad deserting the other place I go to.  But she is sweet and professional.  They struggle to make things work around the government rules. They gotta eat too.  Regardless this place  is awesome.    Clean sanitized and quiet area</Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><text>I am utterly surprised this salon has so many good reviews, that’s the only reason I came.

Their work is Amateur to say the least! They don’t use cuticle remover cream, they barely touch on those (both feet and hand) they provided me with  a sheet of colors that looked a bit too small of a selection, when I asked they said that’s all they have, but when they sat me down they had a huge wall with plenty more options (lazy much?)

Their sanitary precaucions for me were not good, they had gloves while doing my feet but not my hands, never saw them spraying alcohol to the instruments before they were used and it honestly was overall a bad experience.

They do OLD fashion amateur work.

best nail place!! perfect nails in only 1 hour (for acrylics) did very well managing the whole corona virus rules and was very cautious! love the girl that did my nails, didn’t catch her name though. definitely recommend and will be returning only to Fantabulous Nails! 🥰

I am editing this two months later. I am still waiting for a lady to come and sit down to do my nails and it’s been 30 minutes since my appointment time. Very frustrating< /review>

<Text>I came here with my mom and plan on coming back because of the great service. With everything going on with COVID-19 they are taking the safety measures seriously to protect both the employees and customers. Walking in they took my temperature, kindly asked me to wash my hands, provided hand sanitizer. They also put up clear barriers between the employees and customers. Not only that but they took the extra initiative to place barriers between customers and other customers. I felt very safe coming here and I can tell they are actively disinfecting  and taking precautionary measures.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The staff there are superb, along with the beautiful and modern salon. My nails turned out absolutely perfect!
I have gotten so many compliments from men and women.  I have to admit that I showed up 30 minutes before they closed but they still saw me and stayed more than an hour after closing time to finish me up.

Thank you Fantabulous Nails & Spa for my amazing nails< /text>

I’ve been here several times now, usually with a different nail technician each time, and always receive an excellent shellac manicure. Their manicures last longer than other places. Most likely because they take their time and are attentive to details. The deluxe pedicure is also wonderful and a great price.<//Text>

<Text>I honestly don’t know why they have so many good reviews, but my pedicure was one of the worst I’ve ever had. The person who did my pedi started to dig out my ingrown toenail when I didn’t ask her to and she made it worse, it hurts so bad and it’s now infected. My gel polish was painted all over my cuticles and only lasted 4 days before it started peeling off. For a $53 pedicure I’m really upset and concerned about my toe.

The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the friend I was with had an okay experience. Maybe it was just the person that did my pedi, but I don’t want to risk it and I won’t go back there.<//Text><username>Nikki Longmire</username>< date>

I go here every 2 weeks, and I love this place so much!! Everyone is so friendly, and my nails are never anything less than perfect! Although they are always pretty busy, it never feels like they rush to get my nails done with. They take their time, and treat me with respect and kindness. I get a dip set every time, and they have so many colors for me to select from.  I highly recommend this place!</Review>

Diane and Luna are my favorite two ladies and do fabulous work everytime I come here.  I've been coming here since the shop opened 5 months ago and have never been disappointed in services of waxing and nails. The spa is beautiful, airy and clean.  They take their time and accommodate any requests and will guarantee you are happy with your nails and feet and won't rush you out the door. Please come and check out Diane and her staff. You will be happy that you did.</Text>

The owner of this spa was amazing. She was friendly, open about the prices and different types of services. The employees were friendly and didn’t just talk to each other like other places. Would highly recommend due to its great service and shiny new machines... by the way I almost passed out with the amazing massage chair😍</text>

<text>I have been going to Fantabulous Nails & Spa consistently for the last 6 months or so.  They are efficient, kind and provide a high quality service.  I've paid almost twice as much for manicures at other places and inevitably the gel is peeling within a week.  I get a gel manicure every three weeks and the gel is still on almost perfectly and with almost zero peeling!< /text><resp>{'time': 1618780111786, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your feedback!'}</resp>< Name>

First time clients. I brought my daughter-in-law and we both got pedicures and manicures...she also got a full set. The ladies that worked on us were so very nice. They took their time with us and made us feel very pampered.  Definitely going back!< /review>

I have now been going to Fantabulous for months and I love them. Over the years I've never really found a single nail salon that I loved, so I floated from one to the next... until now. Diane and all the ladies are an absolute pleasure, they take the time to do a good job and are always so sweet. I have not had any issues at all which seemed to always be the case with other places. I can't recommend them enough!!</Text>

I highly recommend Fantabulous! Diane, the owner, is a great nail tech. I'm from out of town, and have been getting my nails done for over 20 years. Needed a fill, and Diane was able to fit me in last minute! She takes her time, is meticulous, and does excellent work!< /text>

This place is amazing! I have the worst track record with pedicures but this place finally broke it. They were nice, friendly, and stayed 30 minutes after closing for my sister and I to get fantastic pedicures! Will definitely return and recommend to everyone!</Review>

My daughter and I came in this evening and immediately felt welcome in such a clean space with friendly people. They took time to do our nails without rushing and even made my 10 year old daughter happy with beautiful flowers on her fingers. Thank you and we will be back!< /text>

I was very pleased with the service. I came in with a botched dip manicure from a different nail salon and they cleaned me up and sent me off with perfect nails and eyebrows! The prices were very reasonable as well.< /text>

Such a peaceful and relaxing nail salon! My nails were done perfectly and my favorite part was the use of a hot rock for the mani massage. Will become my new nail salon!< /Review>

Every time I went to this salon, I needed to have my nails fixed.  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the third time was the final straw.  Especially after the owner tried to accuse me for the stones falling off... AGAIN!</Review>

< review>
Went in Saturday morning. Made an appointment over the phone and when I arrived they seated me immediately so that’s a plus! Got gel nails done. Kind of bummed with how my nails turned out because it’s only been a day and there are two nails that are peeling. One started coming off yesterday a couple hours after and today another. I never get my nails done and decided to do it for my college graduation and randomly came to this salon. The staff was friendly and I didn’t have to wait. I’m not sure if the woman who did my nails normally does manicures or the gel they use isn’t good but the last time I got my nails done it took a week or two until I started having them peel. Bummer!<//review>

I've waited a while to write this review. I had a crown put in on one of my molars. The procedure was quick, but pain after it lasted over a month. I had to go to an endodontist for consultation to get a root canal because of that. I came back to get the bite adjusted, and they just adjusted it too much. A year later I have a crown that perforated since the occlusal surface became too thin from adjustment. The crown now needs to be replaced.

It's not just the quality of care that I am unhappy about, but also how they handled the payment. I overpaid during the initial visit, and my insurance covered more resulting in a refund due to me. It took me a month and multiple emails and phone calls to the practice to get the refund even after they received the payment from the insurance and deposited into their bank account (this information was provided by the dental insurance confirming that the check cleared). I kept getting vague answers why my refund was being delayed, but finally got the refund.

An extra star is for dental assistants who truly appeared to want to do the right thing.

Looking back, I should never have selected this dental practice for my care.</Text>

<Text>So from the time I moved back to California I was fortunate to find Dr. Mintor's office. From day one the service there has been second to none, they are always professional and easy to work with. Like most people I have always gotten anxiety when going to the dentist but the staff there has always taken extra care to make sure I'm comfortable and relaxed. I highly recommend their office to anyone.< /Text><name>Christian Holmes< /name><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>5< /Rating>< Time>

<Text>I highly recommend Signature Dental Care to family and friends. It is always an enjoyable visit when my son and I come in for our dental cleanings and exams in Murrieta. My son(5) has zero hesitations about going to the dentist and loves that he gets to pick something out of the treasure chest at the end of the visit! Thank you, Dr. Minter and team!!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Everyone was great... helpful, patient, kind and knowledgeable.
Everyone including the technicians and the dentist explained everything before they started and gave me options.
They accepted my request for an emergency appointment and treated me all in the same day.
I didn’t hesitate to make a follow up appointment and I’ll go back for all my treatments.
I would recommend this practice to anyone who asks for a reference.<//Review>< pictures>

I truly  enjoyed my office visit  to Signature Dental.
What is not to like? It was like meeting up with friends I had not seen in a few months.
we laughed and all of you made sure I was completely comfortable. Thank you for making  sure everything was wiped down and clean.< /Text>

<text>I’m not sure how to start this review other then to say where has this dental practice been my whole life. From Susie in the  front office Who went out of her way to accommodate my crazy schedule,  to Mary Ann the Hygienist who was so gentle but thorough  and to Dr Minter Who was the nicest dentist I have ever met.... What a class act by everyone!! I have never felt good about any dental office until today!
If you are ever in need of a Great Dentist and fantastic staff  then Dr. Minter At Signature Dental Care is who you should be calling...today!< /text>< user>

<text>I usually have enjoyed my time at this office but I will not be returning. I am very disappointed in how they treated me. It was unprofessional and they had no clear explanation to why they decided to deny to care for me. I felt humiliated and discriminated against because of my occupation. Amidst the covid virus pandemic, I definitely understand that people are scared and afraid so I see the place that their actions were coming from. I know it wasn’t meant to be malicious but how they acted was very unprofessional and they were frankly unprepared to prevent transmission of the virus. I also want to add that It is unrealistic to expect all the people who you care for to have a zero chance of having covid. Therefore, you were unprepared. Especially with covid cases escalating every day. It is not going anywhere anytime soon so if you're going to be unprepared, then have stricter regulations or close your office for non-urgent matters to prevent transmission. My appointment was rescheduled due to the pandemic which is completely understandable. I am finally able to fit in my appointment in between my full time job and school. I get there and they check my temperature, pulse ox, they take my xrays and I’m sitting in the chair waiting to get my teeth cleaned. I am having a friendly conversation with staff as usual and after finding out where I work, the dentist assistant tells me she forgot something, then lied to me and said that the doctor overheard our conversation. The desk assistant told me that the dental assistant was the one who reported it which was already obvious since she suddenly forgot something. Then the dental assistant told me I had to leave because of where I work and because I mentioned that I heard we are supposed to be getting tested. I explained to her that I never cared for any known covid patients and that everyone is getting tested for the safety of the patients not because I’m suspected of having covid or have been exposed. I was told that I still need to leave and I can come back in two weeks. I walk out of the room and it’s a ghost town. This two week rule makes no sense because I never cared for anyone with covid that I know of and I will still be working at my job in two weeks. I know that if I did come back, I would receive very minimal care based on their reactions so I will not be coming back. I understand you guys are afraid and scared, but you guys need to understand that you will be caring for people who are not as transparent as I am and you guys should better prepare yourselves. If you want to deny dental care to healthcare workers then be up front about it, please state that or at least have a questionnaire so we don’t have to schedule time out of our lives to get there and feel the way that you made me feel. Also, educate yourselves. There are many people that work in the medical field and those people are aware that coming into contact with someone who has covid will be inevitable. Those people also know that wearing PPE correctly will protect you from this virus. Which is why many of our healthcare workers are not getting the virus. The lady at the front desk was not even wearing a mask. This pandemic is not going anywhere anytime soon. Educate yourselves more on transmission prevention, be transparent with your customers, and be better prepared please.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>Hygienist Julie is the absolute bomb.  I have had some bleeding of my gums for more than a few visits to this office.  While I loved my office experiences with Everyone, Julie correctly identified the two major sources which included her lending her very complete and thorough expertise at getting a deep cleaning which has now cleared any bleeding.  I am most appreciative of her and enjoyed so much her bubbly personality.  I mostly appreciate having a cleaning which needed to be done!< /text>< date>

I met the new dentist today, Dr. Minter, and she is so kind.  I had a filling done and I was very comfortable. The Dr. was very attentive to when I needed a break throughout the procedure.  I would highly recommend this dentist to my closest family and friends.<//text>

<review>Dr. Minter is awesome!! (Obviously, I am biased - but after 20 years I stand behind my claim ;) Signature Dental Care and Dr Minter use 3D digital imaging and 1-visit dentistry with CEREC.The technology alone will impress you but our true strength is in the pride we take in caring for our patients.

I do not like Dentists, at least that is what I have said for year! But, my older sister (who lives in Washington State) wanted to find me one that was the best rated and guess who she found for me? You got it, Ilien Minter! Everyone there was so friendly and kind and just wonderful from the second I walked in. They all helped out and weren't in a rush to get done and ship me out on my way, they discussed a plan for my work and spaced it out so I could get the "have to" things done and be able to save for the rest of "our" plan for the work! I can't say enough about all the Girls/Women there and I am so happy my Sister forced me from afar to go to the Dentist. BTW, I am not a little kid I am a 56 year old man who now likes Dentists, well at least one! Thank you Ilien and Team!< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>This was my first visit to Dr. Minters office, and the moment I had walked into the doors I was treated as if I were family. During my first visit, Alyssa had assisted me during my initial exam. She was very personable and professional which helped ease my dental anxiety. Alyssa had graceful hands during my teeth cleaning, and felt no discomfort whatsoever.

After my initial cleaning, I had then consulted with Dr. Minter about my teeth and she was able to prioritize her top suggestions of dental work that was needed. Dr. Minter was open and honest with me about the work that was truly needed during our initial consult. I had previously gone to Menifee Dental Group and Orthodontics, and they mentioned that I needed several root canals, which wasn’t the case at all.

I am very fortunate to have a trusted doctor like Dr. Minter. They were able to get me on a payment plan that allowed me to afford her quality work. She is the top cosmetic dentist in the area, and offers a wide variety of services like Same Day Crowns, Invisalign, Teeth Laser Whitening & much more! I look forward to visiting her practice again and kick start my new smile with Invisalign. Thank you again for the best dental experience I’ve ever encountered.</Review><UserId.>116442401180866493038</UserId.>< Date>

Intestines (big, small, stomach, and other organs that I didn’t fully understand) take away to cook at home.  These are by far the best I’ve had thus far.  Worthy of a visit.  I know many might get grossed out, but it was very good and worthy of a try for those who’ve never tasted it before. 😋<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Wow, this place is amazing!!!  The quality of their prime steak is superb.  Marbling is excellent and taste out this world.  Best Korean BBQ I've ever had.  I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of fine dining and avid steak lover.  Costco prime ribeye is my personal favorite and I dine at Ruth Chris and Morton's frequently.  What surprised me was the quality of the meat served here for all you can eat BBQ.  Not to mention, everyone here is very friendly and brings your food without any attitude or hesitation.  I am a big eater so I kept ordering more and each time, the manager and the young lady brought my food with a smile and asked me if I needed anything else.

If u like large and small intestine then this is the place to eat. I think this is their specialty. The place is decent size like 7-8 tables. We didn't go for the intestine rather the prime beef brisket and Angus beef. It was really good but not $80 worth which how much we paid for. The sides are not bad..i can't believe they made me eat onions and I really liked it. It was a really nice experience eating here but we won't be coming back.< /Text>

<Text>My first time eating Korean grilled offal. The food was great! Service was middling, but there were only three servers for the whole restaurant. The combo comes with your choice of three organs, as well as stew (choice of kimchi vs doen jang chigae), steamed egg, and corn. The intestines were cut up by the server and allowed to crisp up on the cast iron plate. The intestines were crispy, chewy, fatty, and flavorful. We also ordered naengmyun, which was a great complement to the hot food. I was full for the rest of the day. The one complaint is that they forgot the doen jang chigae we ordered but brought it out at the end. Would definitely try again, but I want to try the LA location and try the pork belly!< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPYjssJi7zQsD2aDfX9ZbzU7V_LoNxRu75zgQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhwc29gYlW7Fvj5HQwsZaIUOR3wXfs-WlYVS4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><name>Andrew Kao</name>< gmapID>

Best gopchang place I've ever eaten. Had to wait an hour since the place was small but totally worth the wait. The quality was similar to ones I've eaten in Korea and the gopchang is already cooked in the kitchen so we ate immediately. The cost was great with combo meal they had and definitely filled me up. There is no other gopchang place that I know in LA with that great of taste. Will be my go to place for it.< /review>

<Review>Service was fine. I timed my visit right before the dinner rush and was seated fast. The one star rating comes from the extremely low value that you get for your money. This place is NOT cheap. The minimum combo item count is 2. I got the combo in the beef section. Each item averages to $35. That’s $70 minimum then. What you get is a really small portion of meat. This meat is not of any significant quality. It is just as any meat you can buy in a mid-tier meat store. First-time diner and I will not come back. I will not recommend and I will spread my findings.<//Review><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

It took 90 minutes to get seated after we were told 40. Other than that, the service was good, this place is just too small. The intestines were great, other meats were pretty mediocre. Overall not worth the wait. Ventilation is poor and the use of canned heat and rickety stands to hold up the heavy pans seems a bit unsafe, as well. I don't think I'll let my friends trick me into coming to this place again, haha.<//Text>

This place is known for their good 'intestines' BBQ' and it must say they were pretty good!  They open around 3pm and by the time we got there which was around 4pm we were fortunate to find a open table and soon saw people waiting outside for 20-30 minutes.   This place is relatively small with about 10 tables for 4 people and parking spot is also packed.   We ordered one 'large' order of mixed intestines ( you can pick which kind) and it was decent size for 3 people and cold noodle (nengmyun) to cap it off.  Spicy sauce nengmyun is what you want to order, not the cold soup based.  We also saw many people ordered intestines to go and serve at home as they are half cooked when taken out.<//review>

This place is best for the locals.  Faint at heart, keep an open mind. They specialize in beef intestines, but also have brisket and pork belly.  A bit rich for my blood and not something you want to eat daily, unless you want clogged arteries lol.  Their service was good and the brisket and pork belly were great cuts.  They don't serve many side dishes other than onions, bean sprouts, and chives. For a small appetite, you may get out of there shy of $30.  Otherwise the other cuts are a bit more $$. ** the pork belly is delicious here!</Review>

Korean BBQ restaurant specializing in innards.  It is not an all you can eat restaurant but the portions are good size and prices are typical for this type of restaurant.  We ordered the mix innards plate, which consists of small intestine, large intestine and part of the stomach.  They pre cook the intestines and you finish cooking it on a hot plate at the table.  We also the brisket.  This was precooked and not finished at the table, but would have been better if you could cook it yourself.  The staff was attentive and friendly.<//text>

Taste was good. Service wasn't. It took 40min for main dish, never apologized. Witnessed others were getting mad also and didn't want to pay for the food.
Hope they fix it!<//review>

<review>It takes time to get meat dish since they cook it half way before it comes to ur table.  Intestine BBQ is far far better than any other Korean BBQ restaurants in anywhere in US. I went there 3 times in one week.
Fyi, if u stay late, they will share their own dinner food, which u won't see on the menu...... good stuff!!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>We visited this Gem of a place about a month ago...I think I wrote a review on Yelp and Facebook because I could not wait to tell everyone how fantastic this place was.  I spent a lot of time in Korean and I grew to love the people and their customs, but mostly I loved the food!  I just love Korean food and every time you walk into an establishment there, they were warm and friendly and so attentive.  I loved it.  I felt like I was home when we first entered Hak San.  It was so familiar.  They keep the traditional feel of Korea and the food is so very good.  I recommend it to anyone that loves to try new flavors, or anyone that loves food.  Sooo good!<//Text><response>None<//response><Date>1468539611118</Date>< UserId.>

<GmapID>0x80dd2d125896432f:0xc8e28e3230a62d4d<//GmapID><text>(Translated by Google) The taste of cold noodles I've never tasted since I was born. I got up right after eating one chopsticks. In the broth, the taste of tan and bitter tastes the same, and the noodles are not melted... I ordered it because it specializes in naengmyeon, but it is a waste.
Mulnaengmyeon and Babimnaengmyeon were both worst.
The seasoning of bibim naengmyeon is very light, but the end taste is also tan and bitter.
When I brought food, I asked for broth, but I didn't respond, but when I was calculating, I asked for broth, but I asked why I didn't, but I looked at it and there was no response.
Other customers said it was delicious because it tasted strange.
It is the worst cold noodles in my life that I have never eaten in Korea and the United States.

태어나 처음 먹어보는 냉면 맛.  한 젓가락 먹다 바로 일어나 버렸다.  육수에서는 탄맛과 쓴맛이 같이나고 면이 풀어지지도 않고...  냉면도 전문으로 한다고해서 시켰는데 별하나도 아깝다.
물냉면  바빔냉면 둘다 최악이었다.
비빔냉면은 양념이 아주 밍밍한데 끝맛은 또 탄맛과 쓴맛이 올라온다.
음식 가져왔을때 육수달라고했는데 대꾸도 안하고 계산할때 육수달라했는데 왜 안주냐고했는데 한번 쳐다보고 대꾸도 없다.
냉면 맛이 이상하다하니 다른손님들은 맛있다 했다고한다.
한국 미국 통틀어 먹어보지 못한 내 생애 최악의 냉면이다.<//text>< time>

(Translated by Google) The service is good and the taste is good~
There are many stops where you have to wait from 6 o'clock except for the open hours. It’s okay after 9pm
I like the taste of makchang daechang that I wait and eat

서비스도 좋고 맛도 좋은 곳이네요 ~
오픈 시간을 제외하고 6시부터는 기다려야 하는 경유가 많습니다. 저녁 9시 이후는 괜찮네요
기다려서 먹는 막창 대창 맛이 좋아요</review>

You can taste the taste of Gangnam cow Daechang :)

The price seems to be expensive, but if you look closely at the Gram, it is by no means expensive compared to Korea.

강남의 소 대창 맛을 느낄수 있습니다 :)

가격은 비싼 듯 하지만 자세히 그람를 따져보면 한국에 비해 결코 비싸지 않습니다

<review>(Translated by Google) I ordered three combo giblets and they all tasted good.
The service seemed a little lacking.
There are a lot of servers to work with (they seem to be using a lot of servers) and they seem to be unaware of what they are supposed to be servicing when they need to turn their guts around and get more attention to what they want and what they need.

세 가지 콤보 곱창을 오더해서 먹었고 모두 맛이 좋았다.함께 나오는 반찬들도 맛이 좋았다.음식 맛은 좋은데
서비스는 좀 부족한것 같았다.
일하는 서버들은 많은데 (쓸데없이 많은 서버를 쓰는듯)그들은 무엇을 서비스 해야 하는지 잘 모르고 있는듯 했다.언제 곱창을 뒤집어 주고 손님이 무엇을 원하는지,무엇이 더 필요한지 좀 더 세밀하게 관심을 가질 필요가 있어야 한다<//review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) There is always a lot of people waiting for more than 40 minutes but it is delicious and I will go again.
The staff was friendly and nice.
However, the parking space is narrow.

I highly recommend Dr. Schmidt and her staff. They are professional, friendly and kind. I have always felt safe and I know I’m in good hands whenever I’m in their office. I also feel confident that I’m getting the best medical services. Their equipment is modern which makes eye exams productive and time efficient. The optomap exam is so important as you age which is why I’m so happy Dr. Schmidt has the best equipment. If you go to Northwest Optometry, there won’t be a need to dilate your eyes, endure loss of vision and/or take time off work to get a full imaging of your eyes. It’ll all get done in less than one hour and you can drive yourself and continue your business for the day. I think this is great because I know this is not the case at all ophthalmologists’ offices. In the past, I endured having my eye dilated. Since I have a low tolerance for pain and discomfort, the exam was unsuccessful and I my vision was blurry for several hours. I no longer have to worry about that if I go see Dr. Schmidt. I’m so happy I found her.<//text>

I love having my vision care at Northwest Optometry. Everyone who works there is so nice and helpful, and they have a wonderful selection of frames to choose from. Choosing new glasses is a fun experience with the team, April and Norma always help you pick a flattering pair within your budget. The technology of the office is current and allows for a quick but thorough exam. Dr. Schmidt is knowledgeable and kind.< /text>

Dr. Schmidt and her staff at Northwest Optometry are amazing. They always go above and beyond. It doesn’t matter if it’s an eye emergency, or a regular check up, they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and provide the best care possible.
I would highly recommend Northwest Optometry.< /text>

<text>I haven't seen an Optometrist for over 10 years but figured now was a good time. I asked around to friends for their recommendations and a few recommended Dr. Amanda. The registration process was easy, check-in was quick, and the appointment itself was painless. I opted to do the extra screen since my eyes hadn't been checked in so long. Do it, it's worth it! The gal who did all my testing,  I believe her name was Jennifer, was super thorough in her explanations and very friendly. Meeting with Dr. Amanda was a breeze too. She is personable, clearly explains the results, and makes you feel like a valued client. Dr. Amanda ended up prescribing me to some lenses and then I met with Norma to pick out the frames. I was very impressed with the styles offered and wide range of brands from Guess to Tom Ford!t Norma took the time to study my face and personality then helped me pick out the perfect frames. I highly recommend Northwest Optometry!!< /text>< user_id>

Dr. Schmidt is an excellent doctor, with an excellent support team. Well-educated, current with medical research, and technologically savvy, she takes very good care of her patients - available to us whenever we need help. Her support staff works diligently to allow everything in the office to run smoothly, and they are very kind and helpful. My life is much better with her, and I feel extremely safe trusting her with my health.</text>

Wonderful staff here. I LOVE how they help and are very reasonable and efficient with the job. Thanks Jose for the wonderful job you did. We had two tires replaced and the back brakes done, along with a alignment. Wonderful job and reasonable price. Yes they repair flats for free.</text>

My last experience was terrible. I just stopped by today and mentions my car issues, there was 1 other person ahead of me and I was surprised at how quick my car was serviced. I'm glad I didn't let the previous trip stop me from coming back and I'm glad I gave it a second chance. The fact that the time I was given was more accurate to how long I had to wait. I would recommend. Good service. Thank you< /Text>

If possible, I would have left a 0 star review. This shop had done good work for me in the past. This time around they messed up my engine and charged me for a new one. This is a shady shop. Don't go unless you need cheap used tires.</Text>

<review>Had an appointment today with this location. However for some reason it wasn’t showing but had my confirmation. Sandoval told me not to worry as he would assist me. The tires I ordered online wasn’t in stock but he gave me a similar brand and honored the price quoted. Her also advised me status on my rear brakes and provided me a package which is much cheaper than what Gardena Nissan offers. Advised him I would return in 2 weeks for my brake service. Thanks Sandoval for your assistance. My car is driving much better now.

Good customer service.  Good pricing.
I'm kind of new in town and my car a got flat tire during the lockdown.  I randomly went to American Tire Depot as a walk-in customer.  The front desk worker was calm and polite; He sensibly answered all my questions and explained pricing options in advance, so I could decide what I could afford.  My car tire was fixed in less than 10 minutes!</Text>

Best tire shop in LA by far!
Trustworthy friendly folks
Fantastic service and very fair prices.
Highly recommend them.
I've bought a few sets of tires for my wife and daughters car as well as my own.. always had a great experience.. Keep up on the tire rotations and you will be very happy how long your tires will last.
They've also fixed flats from nails,etc. quickly and professionally. They stand behind their products and take great care of their customers.< /review>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Update: the management learned of the quality of service I received and they rectified the situation.

Paid to have new after market shocks and upper control arms to be installed on the front end of my truck. I also paid for an alignment totaling $450. Thats no chump change. Initially I thought everything was good until I heard my front tires screech when I drove over a speed bump. When I looked under the front end of my truck, I noticed they installed the upper control arms incorrectly to the spindle. I told them what I heard and what I observed and they put it back together correctly. However, I still heard the screech driving over speed bumps. I took it to the dealership and they had to realign the truck. Basically, it appears they didn’t do an alignment. I paid the dealership $160 to align it correctly. Now, it’s working as it should within spec. Needless to say, I wasn’t satisfied with what I paid for. I didn’t pay for any parts, just labor and for $150 an hour for a three hour job only to have problems within a week after installation, I didn’t get what I paid for.

The tire in our car almost shredded up while my husband was on his way to work , so I have to help him take care of it . While waiting for  AAA to tow the car to the nearest tire station/ store to replaced it , I called American Tire Depot ,and  Omar took care of my tire issue right away. He was very helpful . He did apologized that I have to wait because  he has to have the tire picked up from their warehouse .  The specific tire for the car was not available in their store .  As soon as the tire arrived , they were able to work on it right away  . They have great price comparable to other tire stores . I’m very grateful for their help and honest input . Thank you to Omar and their crew .<//text>

Best customer service Ive had in San Pedro, not only did Omar give me the best service he also explained to me step by step and showed me what I needed. While I was there I saw how other customers left happy with the services these techs did to there cars. Will be coming back for future recommendations and I will definitely recommend family and friends to this shop. Five stars well deserved.< /Review>

<review>Be prepared for the upcharge. They were trying to charge me $600+ for a $70 job. I told them no thanks then called the wife to sell her the good deal. I then called and told them don't do it. I sensed the frustration in the man's voice and I picked my car up. Upon getting my vehicle, I noticed multiple clamps and zip ties disconnected and cut. I thought I got them all until a hidden radiator hose blew off mid drive. I waited on writing this review because I don't know if this was management-driven, disgruntled employee or possibly a mistake. The way I see it, if a professional didn't notice the amount of clamps removed, then that also is a lack of professionalism. The amount of damage this has caused my car is terrible. I write this message to let the company know that it was noticed. Maybe more reviews will come in like this. I'll never return here.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Frank was the supervisor who help me out on everything and all the special deals they had there he was very helpful friendly very talkative cheerful and just made me feel welcome to be there Ryan was the technician who fixed my car with the Alignment putting on the new tires with my brakes and also with my old change but most of all what I liked about Ryan is that they close at six and he stayed after to still fix my car with no questions asked didn’t bother him that he had to stay late He took his time on my car and never rushed through any repairs  he did to my vehicle So I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I will definitely go back for any service I need done to my vehicle again<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>These guys are great! I came in with my Audi and they could not find the master key. The tire guys helped me as best he could. Ultimately I had to go back to Audi to get the locks changed. In the meantime ATD kept my tires and waited for me to return. In an hour I was done and my car was perfect. They are reasonably priced and have great deals! Never going to the dealership after this.</text>< user_id>

<Review>I came down to try and fix my tire or rim and they said they sealed my tire and I wouldn’t need to fix my rim for awhile as well as took an apparent nail out. They said no charge but I could give the mechanic a tip. I was happy too! I gave him 20$ because i felt good about the work. They never let me see the work or ask me to come look at what was wrong or the nail itself. The next day I go to drive my car and my air out of my tire is even worse! So I called them back and was placed on hold for over 12 mins. I hung up and called back and they tried placing me on hold again until I said no I can’t hold it’s urgent. I told the supposed manager I had dealt the day before what happened. They said they sealed and took tire out and next option was send out my rim which would be no cost to ship out but estimated at 80-100$ for the rim repair. I decided to hit another tire spot and they showed me where they tried gluing my cracked rim! GLUING!!! And also the nail was still there!!!! I’m never going back here, sneaky and screwy!< /Review>< userid>

These guys treated me so well as soon as I stepped checked out my car for any issues. Everything just turned out I needed an alignment, while I stressed over being suspension issues. But felt relieved these people were talking like actual experts knowing there work unlike other places I’ve been to. Keep up the good work.<//text>

Friendly staff great customer service. Detailed inspection (free) which I was included in viewing step by step. Provided a detailed receipt if issues (even if I didn't get fixed) . parking is limited if you have a following party. They also have a payment option that I thought was a nice choice for bigger purchases.</review>

I returned back to American Tire Depot unexpectedly to have an electric motor put in my right door. I received first class service from manager, Eddie Rivera who made my need a priority.  He ensured I got the best price and was satisfied.  Ramon, the technician gave me a ride home and back.  This helped me not to be inconvenienced. I am happy and appreciate the service that I received from American Tire Depot in San Pedro. Eddie and his staff are profession, courteous and highly skilled.</Text>

Absolutely wonderful staff! Very knowledge and willing to help. Had a huge problem with my old shock and struts so I had a new set or Rachos 90000 put on my Tahoe Z71 4X4. Let me just tell you my baby drives like if she just had a mommyTahoe makeover. So thank you once again I’ll be sure to  refer friends and family. We are now off road ready!< /Text>

Edward and his staff were fast, professional, kind, and did quality work. Wish I could rate this shop 10 stars. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone in need of tire expertise.

I bought my tires here three years ago, and today I came to get tires rotated for free under the 36 month guarantee. I was in and out in 20 minutes. Everyone is very friendly and helpful and their prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this tire store.<//Text>

The child behind the desk is unprofessional with no type of customer service. I can tell he doesn't care about making business because of his body language and the way he ignores you and just wants your car keys with money. I do not recommend this place due to his ignorance. And it's so obvious that all these reviews are FAKE!! the people commenting only have 1 review! Lol what a joke of a business.< /review>

<Review>If I could give this place NO Stars 👎🏼.i would . This place SUCKS & I do not recommend anyone go there!! When Eddie was manager a few years back it was great but NOW the service & work SUCKS ! I went on Tuesday 1/15/19 and spoke to a “Jimmy” . He did not greet me nor ask me what he could help me with upon arrival. He almost had a facial expression as if he was upset that I was there . He then tossed me a form to compete & he went on to ask me for my keys and instructed me to stay in the waiting area ( he did not ask me what I needed help with ) When he came back into the room I walked up to the counter and  he was texting the whole time & when I was trying to explain to him what I was there for ,he continued to fiddle with his phone and made no eye contact with me . His body language and demeanor  was very un-inviting and unprofessional. I did inform him that his customer service was unprofessional and he replied by saying “oh that’s nice” . I will never go to this place EVER again. This was by far the worse customer service I have ever experienced.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1548183609951, 'text': "Hi I Hernandez, We would like to extend our deepest apologies for the inconvenience you've encountered.

<review>There right now with a flat. Ended up seeing for myself that the other tires needed to be changed. Ernest was the guy at the front desk who helped me. Very nice guy, and knew his stuff. I wanted to buy 4 new BF Goodrich ($50 rebate) and he got me interested in a Toyo Extensa tire (which I looked up to make sure right in front of him), and it checked out. He also told me I'll get a $60 rebate instead of $50 and I think he hooked me up w a Military discount of a few bucks because I am active duty.

Jimmy is the technician who fixed my tires and he literally stopped what he was doing and immediately went to fixing my van tires.

Everyone here was NORMAL. What I mean is, with what I do for a living in the Military, I am always trying to figure out if people are lying to me, being fake, and getting a quick read of people around me. These guys are normal joes trying to make a living. They are not extra nice or extra weird, just perfectly normal and I LOVE that.

To add to this and their level of care and honesty, they came inside and took me out and showed me that one of the back tires was basically new. He GAVE me an old rim with the good tire and said I should keep that as a spare.

Then, as if that wasn't enough, Ernest showed me the rebate for $60 off, took the time to show me how to do it, and showed me how it works. Then he asked me how many kids I have and said I can also get 4 free tickets to a go-cart track in LA that my kids have wanted to go to for a long time.

At one point he couldn't find the promo at first and said that if it was over he would just take $60 off the tires. Very nice man.

This place makes me feel like Pedro still has hope. This place gives you that 1960's feel that Pedro is supposed to give.

Good job American Tire Depot! I was worried because of places like Johnnies Auto Clinic, but this place is good. I am only speaking for the tires and not any other part of this place because I didn't use those services.

- I will say however, as EVERYONE will agree with me, that the only negative thing about this place, that they can't control, is that I had to fork over almost $500 bones. I hate that. It is what it is though.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcNA_tDf1pi1pCl0I2zVLF7HrE5GDkpzCdkrEY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd362fd338523d:0x65afaa0d9eb9c84<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I made an appointment for 8 am the day before and got there 7 to 8. The shop wasn't open. I waited till 8:10 and left. I could hear the phone ringing inside but it went unanswered.

The guy behind the counter must hate his life or job.. or both ... His customer service is absolutely terrible.... Aside from that I Walked in to set up an appointment for an alignment... They told me it's be 3 hours so I go home... Rest... Then return for the alignment ... Before I even finish opening the door all the way the cashier tells me ... "Our machine arm is broken so we can't align your car ... Try somewhere else... It's now 4:10 pm and everywhere else I called is obviously too busy to take my car...

If the machine was broken ... Why couldn't they have called and given me a heads up to head somewhere else in time?</text>

<review>Update, from 5 stars to 4 because I wrote this before my car was completely finished .. there were greesy dirty fingerprint s left all over my rims, and on the inside of my cars door near the window. Everything else was great, but after just having my car detailed the previous day, least they could have done was wipe off their prints off my clean white car. This is not what I expected for the amount of money I spent. The guys were just trying to get out of there right at the closing time, if they had walked me to my car I would have said something.

The service I got today was excellent; Edward showed me the best possible deals. I came in for a free brake inspection, and estimate for new tires.. and because the customer service was so great, and I felt so comfortable, I'm leaving with brand new front brakes, resurfaced roters, 4 new TOYO tires w/ 60k mile warranty, and alignment.

Best part is, I paid nothing because I qualified for $0/0% interest when paid within 6 months!

Highly recommended, if you drive a lot like I do, affordable, and I even qualify for a $100 rebate on the tires! It took about an hour and half.. and is a local small business, so people looking to support their community business, stop by.. it's not to be confused with America's tires, this is American* Tires

All of the gentleman who work there are great!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

These guy's are AWESOME. Last week I was across the street at O'Rielys auto parts, looking for a battery for my Chevy Van. It turned out that my starter was bad, not the battery or alternator. So I walked across the street to American Tire depot and spoke to Jimmy. He said, sure we can change out your starter, let find one for you. Well it was going to be late in the day before they could get one, so he asked me to go back and check at O'Rielys for one, and sure enough they had one in stock. Then I called AAA to have my van towed to ATD from O'Rielys and that is when Jimmy said lets just push the van across the street and we can get started on the repair right away. So Jimmy, Victor and myself pushed the van into ATD parking lot and before you know it, Victor was telling me it's fixed.
I will recommend these guy's for anything, Thank You very much Jimmy & crew.

I just moved to this area and needed a new tire. I value honesty and competence and this place gave the impression of neither. The rim was cracked and they wouldn't order just one (insisting I needed to order 4). They also forgot to return the tire spanner. Also they broke the latch off my trunk and didn't tell me. I prefer to make the drive and go to my usual place (American's Tire Store... in no way affiliated with these goofs).< /Review>

Needed front brake pads replaced. I brought my own to save a few bucks, and I had already checked the rotors —they looked good. They tried to up-sell me on turning the rotors, I said I’d drive it a mile home and bring it back the next morning if it really needed it. I was very polite about it. The rep was very rude. When he asked me if I wanted my old parts I started to reply “no that’s ok, I already took a look at them—“ he interrupted me and said “That’s not what I asked you. Do you want your old parts or not!” Wow.
I took my car to another shop this morning for another opinion. This mechanic confirmed the rotors were fine but the calipers had not been lubed when the pads were replaced, the rear tire valve was broken, tire going flat, and my front tire had both a cheap emergency roadside patch AND a nail in it.  DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR BUSINESS. $80 for 15 mins of work and they didn’t do the minimum of lubing when they  replaced the pads or bother to check the tires. The guy was so mad I didn’t go for the up-charge it makes me question if they damaged my front and rear tires on purpose to make me come back.< /review>

<review>I do not recommend this place at all. The guy at the front desk does not know anything about customer service.he is arrogant.when you come and buy stuff they offer warranties and all that but when you come back to try to get something check that is covered they ignore the problems.... i hope they change that and also keep in mind that customer service should be #1. Bring back Eddie< /review></record>

Purchased new tires and the warranty. Normally don't purchase the warranty, but the price was too good not to. It has paid for itself already, and I still have years of warranty.</Text>

Went in for a simple oil change at 5:30 pm because of a coupon I found online. While I was there Edward was so great with showing me the issues with my car. Most mechanics will just tell you whats wrong to try to get you to pay more and its scary to trust them however Edward brought me into the shop where my car was up on jacks and pointed out everything he could see and told me the prices to fix them and then proceeded to just educate me on everything. The thing I respected most was he didnt push anything on me and his demeanor wasnt to try and get me to fix everything right then and there, it was simply just to inform me of the things I may or may not know of.. Even told me a simpler/cheaper way to fix my key fob which is a service he doesnt even do. They really go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of and I would definitely recommend people here. I was treated just like family and the atomosphere they have there is surly a positive one. Thanks American Tire Depot and special thanks to you Edward!</Text>

A bit pricey but it was worth every penny especially on a special occasion.< /review>< rating>

Very relaxing atmosphere! I'm loving this area! The view of the ocean from the sitting area outside is beautiful, and the weather was absolutely perfect.<//Review>

I love this place! There are plenty of nice shops to look at, a Starbucks and quite a few nice restaurants. Down one end is a Trader Joe’s for you groceries and up the other end is an Aston Martin car dealer. There is also plenty of fancy cars coming and going.<//Review>

There is a large selection of fashionable women's dresses to choose from. I liked how light the lamps were. Employees had always taken care of their customers. It was the most enjoyable shopping experience I've ever had.</Review>

<text>One of the best car shows in Orange County. They meet early on Saturday's. Gear heads, great selection of hot rods and super cars, rock music, fun happy atmosphere and friendly people.

One of the places to stop by if you're a tourist and you've never been to San Francisco.  I grew up in the bay so I would always visit this place when my relatives from the Philippines would come visit us. I love this place, I love being by the ocean. It isn't as cool as the beach but it's nice walking on the pier.<//Review>

< Review>
You gotta give it to this shopping center--they do an amazing job of programming! In conjunction with Arts Brookfield, they manage to pull in some of LA's most interesting artists.
Every week they have a series of happy hours in the food court and some type of art installation or live music.
Went to see Tuxedo last week and it was hopping. A huge crowd that couldn't help dancing to the cool grooves of Mayer Hawthorne.< /Review>

Sad looking mall due to Nordstrom's no longer being an anchor store. I only go there because it has the AMC Theaters. Park on the 4th level in the parking structure to be on the same level as the movie theater.< /Review>

<review>I really liked this area. There is a lot of shopping options that would make this a place you can get everything on your list taken care of for the most part. I felt it was upscale and a safe neighborhood to come to. I love everything about California, residents are extremely lucky to live in such an incredible state. I hope when I get closer to retirement I too can call California home. Especially a place close to the beach.<//review>< Rate>

It reminds me of a local mall but it has so much more of a view profound friendliness. I would go out of your way but I would say you should stop if it is in your way. Javier's and Trader Joe's makes it</text>

Even if I go with money to spend, I won't spend ot at places like this. Respect is a hallmark of customer service. Don't expect it at these stores. Over priced and lacking in social skills. Waste of time in my book.</Review>< Pictures>

Very nice and quiet state park. My first time to the ocean was at this place. There's a nice hike if you park away from the bathrooms. The next day I parked next to the bathrooms and you walk down a picturesque mountainside to the beach. Excellent<//text>

A lot of specialty stores here.  Very high-end catering to the Newport Coast clientele.  The Trader Joe's is excellent and I have been to the Bear Flag Fish and it is fabulous.  Some very chic restaurants there also.  Only four star based on the expense vs value.< /Review>

Nice spot for tourists to take a break from traffic on Coast Highway and spend some time walking in a well maintained and landscaped strip mall.  Great selection of a few quality shops, eateries, and a nice Trader Joe's grocery store for healthy food choices.  Plenty of free parking.< /Text>

With the addition of wifi and more outdoor seating, this place has earned a spot in my usual routine when I am home visiting. This place has a wide array food options (ranging from ultra high end to mid tear), great shopping, Trader Joe's and plenty of parking. It is very close to Crystal Cove State Park and makes a beach picnic very easily assessable.</Text>

I love the location, but I'm just not excited about the retail stores offered.  A nice ocean view and upscale modern architecture, makes the experience more appealing.  Lots of comfortable outdoor seating are available to relax or eat between shopping.</Review>

<Text>Here you'll find culinary options from poke at Bear Flag, Italian restaurant Modo Mia, Z Pizza, unique Starbucks, apparel shopping, Trader Joe's market and a charging station for electric cars. Located across the street from Crystal Cove State Park. You can sit outside on comfortable seating and watch the sunset over the Pacific.<//Text>< Pictures>

Nice place but needs more variety and more outdoor seating.  We had to walk a bit and others had to wait.  Might just depend on the time of day.  Also, might need to do something about the birds.  I was attacked by one but no harm done.< /text>

Great shopping center which has amazing views of the ocean which can make your shopping experience more enjoyable. Lots of nice stores like Banana Republic, Gap, Pier One and yes even a Trader Joes. There are also restaurants here is you wish to get something to eat. Really beautiful and clean, wonderful views and the cool ocean breeze.</Review>

Would you like to see women that have had a lot of plastic surgery? Perhaps people who drive Ferraris daily? Then this is the place to go. A lot of excellent restaurants and really nice shops highly recommended but a tad pretentious.</Review>

<Text>This is a great rehabilitation center to go to in Newport Beach if you're really looking for quality help to get clean. I really found myself here and why I even started using in the first place. Long story short, their addiction treatment program works because they personalize it to your particular problem and your needs.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dce14b06fcf21d:0x831d235cf79cbc60<//gmap_id></record>

Even though I miss Pacific Whey Cafe being at this location, I still come for the diverse shopping and dining options.<//text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Fru fru to the max. Just the thing for wealthy locals, who can see the parking lot from their back yards. Great Trader Joe's with really nice staff. A couple of very pricey high end eateries. The typical Starbucks. Not much else for average people. The rent must be insane. You can see some exotic cars often with the Cars and Coffee meetups. Kind of Beverly Hills OC. Interesting people watching.</Review>< pictures>

Beautiful architecture for these shopping places. Plenty of food (seafood, pizza, ect.) drinks (Starbucks, Boba?), home decor, and Trader Joe's. If you're staying at the Crystal Cove this is definitely a great place to stop and get food and supplies.</text>

I come here often, usually to shop at Trader Joe's. I also like to stop in at Pier One or Williams-Sonoma or one of the clothing shops. There are several great restaurants too including Marche Moderne, which just opened recently. If you haven't tried it, you should check it out; it's a great restaurant.</text>

High end shopping center with several nice restaurants as well as a few fast casual dining options (e.g., Bear Flag for great seafood, Starbuck's for coffee, and Z Pizza for good whole and by the slice pizza) and a Trader Joe's market.<//review>

There is a Trader Joes in the Crystal Cove Shopping Center along with a Starbucks.  So if you need some coffee and a few snacks for a trip into south Orange County or north, this is a good place to stop into.<//Review>

The shops are definitely upscale; if you are looking for that kind of thing and can get though the parking lot without a Lucille-Bluth-lookalike driving into you, you'll probably find interesting stuff. Watch out for the tiny ferocious dogs.</Text>
