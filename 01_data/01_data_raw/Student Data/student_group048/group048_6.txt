I stopped by when I couldn't get my new phone to connect to my stereo. Angel was kind enough to stop in the middle of his morning to help me out. He got my bluetooth connected and off I went. Plus I learned that my mistake was not engaging my emergency brake before attempting to connect my phone - who knew? Super kind, helpful shop.< /Text>

<Text>This is the best shop in the area. I've actually worked in the industry for over 15 years and they handle it the best. They're knowledgeable and friendly. Their time quotes are accurate. They honor their guarantees and they do quality work. I've had a bunch of custom work done on my car and each part of it has been well thought out correctly quoted and done professionally.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great customer service,  great quality work, honest and knowledgeable are all words that come to my mind when I think of my experience with lombards. I'm picky and usually have to return my vehicle after it Has a service done because I'm not satisfied with something they did to my vehicle. I feel bad sometimes but I can't help it, I like things done right and I hold myself to those standards. When I got my vehicle back from lombards I was thinking, "dang.. They did a good job". I couldn't find anything to complain about. You won't be disappointed with their work.<//review>< pictures>

So I drove to SLO and met David. He really spent a lot time getting to know what I was looking for in a stereo for my truck. We listened to a lot of different components and I’ll admit I upgraded higher than I expected but his knowledge of how things sound and the quality was much appreciated. I installed all the equipment and came back to get it all tuned up. Can’t say enough about how good it sounds. No distortion at any level. The whole experience was so impressive and I can’t recommend Lombards enough. Do yourself a favor, don’t mess around on the internet. Just go to Lombards.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80ecf1aadcefc807:0xe4c8605e927cbf5a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Had exactly what I needed and found it quickly.  Had to come here after Wal Mart gave me the wrong stuff and didn't have the correct piece in stock.  Showed up to Lombards a little after closing and still got some help!  Definitely coming back for any questions or purchasing I'll be making in the future.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Called to ask if they sold screws for an amp, long shot. they invited me down to see if they might have something to help. It’s very uncommon but they did find one that would work and while I was there I asked about another product I was interested in, got me set up with the latest tech out at a very competitive price and super friendly the whole time. 10/10 recommend I will be back for all electronic needs for my car!<//review>

Extremely knowledgeable staff, Spoke with Angel and Chris and they really helped me out. Had a stereo installed elsewhere, it was done very poorly and tuned incorrectly, Angel hooked me up with tuning and made it sound absolutely awesome. Even if you do not plan on purchasing anything, I recommend going in to just get your stuff dialed in. They KNOW what they are doing!<//Text>

They installed a Android radio, they were very expensive. I asked them to ground the the bypass brake wire, they did not, it was even written the the order. Went back and asked them to do this, they wanted $125 to do it, I said no.
Went home, removed the radio and I found the ground wire had been taped on the end by them, grounded it, works great.
I believe this was a scam to get mo money!
Just purchased another vehicle and installing another android radio, NOT GOING TO LOMBARDS!< /text>

Let’s start this review by saying that these professionals are, without a doubt, the best in the business. From the second you walk in the door you are their only priority. Have an idea of what you want or what you think you want? These guys will set you up with what you are actually looking for at a price that you can actually afford. I had to update my 1990 Dodge Dakota’s stereo system recently because the original cassette player finally gave up the ghost (I know, crazy right) and the front speakers were shot. After only a couple hours, I had a new head unit that could Bluetooth connect to my phone and due to an unforeseen complication with my speakers, Lombard’s upgraded my speakers at no extra charge! If you are looking for top of the line professionalism and experience, look no further!<//Text>

This is my first experience with Lombards and I had a high-end radar detector installed in my Sprinter. The job is done when promised and everything seems to work okay. I think I have a void one ticket already.
I will consider Lombard's when I do my next stereo install<//Text>

<text>Lombards Stereo did an excellent job of installing a rear view camera system on my 2007 Camry.  They worked with me on options and were able to integrate the rear view camera system directly into my car's navigation system display.  Angel of Lombards answered all our questions and even dropped and picked us up from downtown shopping while the system was installed.  Lombards was a great experience and their customer service was outstanding.<//text>< user_id>

These guys were great. I wasn't in the market for anything super pricy, as I am only sixteen and paying for this my self. However, unlike all other stores, I didn't feel rushed through. At other places they tried to get rid of me when I told them my budget.

These guys on the other hand were friendly, respectful, and didn't try to work me past my budget. They have good prices, and they didn't try to sell me something I didn't need.

Anyway, I purchased my stereo, and installed it myself, when I had questions, I called and they were able to answer them in perfect detail over the phone. Very patient, and helpful.

I came back in after realizing one of my speakers wasn't working. They took off my door panel, and found the problem in just a couple minutes, they had the parts needed on hand, and fixed it in about 30 minutes total, very reasonable cost for labor as well.

Overall I give them a five out of five. Excellent service, and because they are a premium dealer for a lot of brands, they over really good warranty coverage.

Thanks guys!

Best in the business. If your looking to build a quality audio system, these guys have the best quality speakers from manufacturers that don't distribute outside of their respective countries. All of the staff are exceptionally knowledgeable and aren't afraid to tell you when you're waisting money. (E.g. $1000 alpine vs $300 maestro)<//text>

<review>I had a new stereo receiver put into my car. It took about 4 hours total, and as far as I can tell everything works great. They are an official dealer for Alpine, which comes with some perks if you buy into that brand of stereo. These include service, and an extended warranty.

I would be lying if I said the prices here are cheap; but they are for the most part fair. I got the base level Alpine CDE-151 receiver for $150, which is exactly what Alpine sells them for online, however you can get the same model on amazon for ~$90. I ended up paying about $60 in other parts required for installation (dash kit, wire harness, and antenna adapter), and $90 for labor. There was also a $7 miscellaneous charge which I am unsure of the cause.

As far as customer service goes, 10/10. The owner, David, showed me all the different options and explained the strengths and weaknesses of each unit to help me decide what I was looking for. There was never any pressure to buy more expensive models, which I really appreciate. He and his staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.</review>< Pics>

<text>Went in to buy RCA cables. The guy told me that the cables were 100 dollars but changed the price to 30 when I expressed my astonishment at that absolutely ridiculous price. I bought them thinking that I was getting a deal but then found the same exact cables online for 7 dollars. Went in again to return the cables and the guy would only offer store credit. These guys are con artists that will soak you. You can probably get anything they sell online for 5 times less than they charge. Stay away.< /text><name>Fred<//name>< Resp>

Not very happy with service. The cost far exceeded their initial estimates. I had to pull apart their install to find a defective RCA splitter that was the cause of a speaker not playing sound but just emitting engine noises. When I called about the issues, I was basically told "well we made sure everything was working so I don't know what to say". I think I expected more of a "bring it in and lets get it 100% for you no problem." I didn't want to risk another $100/hr, so I just fixed it myself after way too many hours of pulling apart the install to isolate the issue.

I will definitely be doing things on my own, or taking my vehicles somewhere else from now on.

I will admit they are decently knowledgeable and friendly, but still, don't want to do business with them anymore myself.< /Text>

These guys are crooks.  Stay away from them.  Took 5 hours for them to diagnose the problem.  For what they charged me to replace a speaker I could have had a new stereo system installed.  Knew insurance was involved and took advantage.  Stay away!!!!!!!!</Review>

DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PEOPLE - They're so arrogant about their service that they couldn't be honest in telling me that they DID NOT specialize in auto-surveillance cameras.  I was the guinea pig.  After leaving $500 deposit to order a surveillance camera system, I was told that they would be ready for install within a couple of weeks.  Two weeks passed and nothing.   Another couple of weeks pass - still nothing but excuses.  I call again after one month - nothing.  I'm told by Angel, "I'll call you!"  After 4 months of waiting, I call, express my frustration in communicating that I AM DONE WAITING and am taking my business elsewhere - please return my deposit.  They refuse to refund my deposit.  I have taken my business to a real professional who installed the cameras (you can see clearly for 2 blocks) for one-quarter of the price.  LOMBARD'S STEREO is less than professiona and is a rip-offl.  AVOID THEM.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I came in to Lombards knowing what I wanted to do and I was given a range of options for a simple stealth modification install of an 8 in sub and a micro amp to a 2016 rav4.
The owner, David,  gave me the rundown and was to the point. They have a lot of options to the work being done. If you want the best in quality sound, you're going to pick the best wiring, which they offer at half off retail.
David was kind and informative and listened to all my stories without being pushy with the sale. I scheduled an appointment that he was able to bump up a day for me and even gave me a ride up the grade while they did the work.
I came from Oakland to get this service because you don't get this kind of quality service and experience in the city. They just want to push you thru so the next customer can give them money.
Quality service.
Quality experience.

The only complaint I have is their no refund policy.
I can see it being necessary for installed components. But a single battery bank for jump starting a vehicle that doesn't work should qualify for a refund, since it was not an installed item, but a seperate item.
Dick move on their part, but they made good by offering an alternative to the $160 in the form of a new car battery for another vehicle.
Thank you.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< review>
I had no idea about car sound systems. I walked into the store just to get an idea about the different types and brands of speakers available besides the ever popular Bose speakers.
I simply strolled into the store and was lucky to meet with the owner David Joy. I asked him to explain to me about how to recognize what is a good speaker and what will be good for what I need. I showed him my car and what I had in it for speakers. He then spent about 90 minutes explaining to me everything that I possibly wanted to know and more. I was extremely pleased with his customer service. I don't think a Best Buy or any other sound system store would spend that much time with a customer.
I eventually got Audison Prima speakers and amplifier, obviously there were more expensive ones but David knew what I was looking for, he showed me cheaper options and played sample music to show me the how different musical instruments and vocals sound on the speakers with and without amplifiers. I must say I was able to make a very educated decision to invest in the sound system I bought. The installation was immaculate, the upholstery on the subwoofer matched that of the car. The rear speakers were perfectly recessed into the rear wall with similar colored grill, very good workmanship.
If you are an entry level customer who do not know much about speakers, amplifiers and stereo systems then LOMBARD Stereos is the place to go in town. I got what I paid for and will definitely go back if I plan to change my stereo system. I was a very satisfied customer. Definitely ask for David if he is in the store.< /review>

Tocayo Birrieria (food truck)parks here almost everyday beginning at 10am. I've been living in this city many years and had no clue. The food is so delicious I recommend it to anyone. I used to drive 45 minutes to find good birria, and when Tijuanazo opened up I was so glad not to drive far. Tocayo is just another delicious option. Thanks crew!<//Review>

T-mobile at 10242 Reseda Blvd., Northridge
Mobile associates : Emma, Miguel, Jun Manager : Joshua
This store was formerly Sprint. I opened an account with 2 lines. Also I brought my friend who opened 2 lines a week ago. We both transferred from AT&T. I was with AT&T for 13 years until Sept 2020.

During these two weeks these 3 associates and the manager helped me with questions either in person or by phone. Thank you for the excellent customer service.<//Text>

All I can say is wow!! Waleid is amazing! He’s attention to detail is beyond good custom service. He’s like he builds a relationship with you in what could be the first and last you see him. He is so helpful and knowledgeable. I felt very confident during my phone upgrade and would highly recommend this store because of their great customer service.< /review>

<text>This Sprint has the best customer service! Today was my second time coming here to see DJ to get a new iPhone 8 Plus. I would never go to any other retailer except this one because DJ always does a phenomenal job. Customer satisfaction at the best!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Today was my first visit to this Sprint store but it certainly won't be my last. I had my phone activated and also needed my data removed off of my prior phone and transferred over to my new one. When I called, they said they could transfer the data to my new phone, several other Sprint stores told me they don't do that anymore.  When we arrived, we were greeted and Eduardo took care of my activation and transferred all my data.  This store will be the only Sprint store I visit from now on.  Everyone was very nice and professional, plus they played great music.  I would give 10 stars if I could!< /Text>

This place is the top place to get the phone. I got phone for me, my wife and her cousin. Customer service is on the highest level. This place should be an example of how this kind of service should work. Waleid rocks it!!!!! Thank you very much!
If you think you deserve the best customer service, that is the place you need to go to get a new phone!< /review>

<text>I had the most valuable experience and service at this store.
Workers are well educated on all current and past promotions, they always try their best to resolve every issues I have. When things don't work out with one worker, other experienced workers/ Kevin manager always jumps in and never leaves my issues unresolved. This store not only offers best possible options in the beginning, but also provides awesome after care, unlike most of the stores where only cares about initial sales. If you come up with any problem, this store will do their best to get rid of it.  Highly recommend this location! :)<//text></record>

Such great, quick service at this location. Worked specifically with Irma Lopez, who was helpful in pulling up all my information, providing and explaining promotions, and making sure all changes were done with limited effort on my end. Would strongly recommend :)</Text>

<text>Representatives are very friendly! You can be helped as soon as you walk in the store, representatives will be pleased to help you find your needs. I used to go to a different store down in Nordhoff and Tampa and I was always hated to go to that store, long wait and rude reps. This location should be the go to store!< /text>< Rating>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>This place is a SCAM - don’t rent from them. The price sounds good at first but their cars are ANCIENT and even if you adhere to the rental agreement they’ll tell you you’re good when you return the car and then days later find out they deduct a huge chunk of your deposit. They require a $500 deposit for all cars and my one day/$25 rental ended up costing me $100 because the guy lied when I returned and said everything was good! Again, don’t rent from them - when you try to call or show up in person to get your money back - nobody takes responsibility and they give you the runaround! Call this number but this lady only works on Tuesdays and then she hangs up once you explain what you’re calling about. I’m filing a complaint and just call your bank and tell them not to pay them.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>**READ BEFORE COMMITTING**

Of course, we are all here for the same reason. That is because we all got scammed by Airport Car Rental. I would recommend not wasting your time giving them business, because they will steal your money. These rates seem too good to be true with their yellow signs and big black and red fonts. In the end, Laura Chavez (the owner) says "I do not care about the customer's... Stop calling to get your money back!".

After many phone call attempts to get my deposit back, she finally gave up. See my photos attached for the receipted refunds. I was smart to use my travel American Express card which does great in protecting me against any wrongful/mistreatment in regards to travel.

Also attached, is a screen shot her personal cell phone number. Give her a call. She gets lonely with a mother of four kids that live outside Carlsbad, CA. She feared of how persistent I was and now it is time to expose the fraud company. I also attached two photos of one of her workers. He claims to have many names, like any other staff member who works there. I snapped many pictures of his face and the car he drove off after he knew he was going to be on camera. He threatened to run me over (the reason for his hands flaring, telling me to move). But Laura Chavez is the owner and responsible for stealing all your monies.

Now the owner will reply to your negative comments saying "We do not see any record of you renting from us." In addition, if you read the five-star rating of the company, that is her! Laura Chavez. Ring a bell? Of course those positive reviews are bogus. But I am here to tell you my experience with Airport Car Rental. Although they scammed me, I won. I got my money back, my rental was fully refunded thanks to American Express, and I have a direct phone line to the lovely owner of the fine establishment. Have a great day, Airport Car Rental! You'll see me very, very soon...<//Text>< gmapID>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. FRAUDULENT COMPANY.
You will not get your deposit back.

Rate quoted as $17/day or $99 week. On my return, they gave me a bill for over $1,000. I had the car 11 days and paid $495 in advance. $300 was a deposit. THEY REFUSED TO REFUND THE DEPOSIT. THEY KEPT ME FROM GETTING MY BELONGINGS OUT OF THE CAR.
The owner lies about not being able to speak English. He speaks perfect English. A GPS tracker is installed on each car and they track and record your every move, without notice or permission.
My car was a 10 year old toyota corolla. radio, heater/ac fan only worked on high speed. windshield washer does not work. Car has more than 200,000 miles.<//review>

When calling about my deposit they ask for a copy of my rental contract and then do not reply or respond to any calls. I went in person after that and they gave me a different number of the lady who picks up paperwork and I called the number and got forwarded to the same guy who will say he will take. Look at the rental contract and then call back. He does not call back about it!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

See the rest of these reviews.  I needed a car in a pinch and saw there janky signs on the side of the road. I should have known better. The little stumpy fat man on Barnett came out and asked for my card.  He gave back and had charged me twice.  Once for $150.00 and another for $500.00 deposit.  He didn't tell me about the 500.00.  When I asked he said he had told me.  He said it would be refunded back.  Upon return he told me that they charge $20.00 for each credit card swipe and I never gave them insurance information which I did.  I provided the documents AGAIN and they said they would refund it.  Later they said they called MY insurance company and they said I didnt have a policy with them hahaha.  What a joke.  Anyway they never refunded my money.  I am trying to work with my bank but the receipts that the stumpy guy sent them were forged with extra charges and the bank says to file a police report.  I will be calling the police tomorrow morning.  They have a F with the BBB.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>zero stars: They should not be allowed to do business. They took advantage of my wife, and rented her a beat up salvage vehicle for $70/day.  My wife is not used to renting, and when I went to talk to them, I saw their big sign outside said $17/day.  $70/day is for Luxury rentals.  They told me that it depends of availability, but their lot was full. The car wouldn't start next day, so I called, and they said their lot is too full, and cannot let me return the car, but I could exchange it.  I went there, after a jump, and saw their big sign that says $17/day.  They guy made a bunch of excuses, "based on availability, no major credit card", etc.  They had bad hearts and are not affected by people's difficulties, but take advantage of people, my wife in this case.  The cars are beat up, scratches, broken bumpers, terrible cars, and they charged wife $70/day, and had no remorse for taking full advantage of her.  They need to stop ripping people off.  Someone needs to investigate them.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Really wish I would have seen these reviews before renting. I'm their latest victim. Scam artist!! Will be reviewing my law books to see them in small claims. Perhaps a class action suit is in order. Know any good attorneys??< /Review>

They are terrific!  Everyone is pleasant and helpful.  They will pick you up if you're staying downtown, and it's easy to get to the freeways from their location.  Their rates are reasonable.</Text>

My mother rented a vehicle and for starters it was a pos. Well she still used as she needed one then as she returned the vehicle she was gonna get her deposit but now a month later they only hang up and say that it’s the wrong company there’s no record of this transaction. We will contact lawyer and bbb.

<text>SCAMMERS DONT GO THERE!!!!  I’d prefer to give them NO RATING!!!  I called in advance before I arrived in CA for my sons military funeral service. They told me to call when I get to airport, so I did. A man picked me up with a beater car and I’m shocked I thought that was the car I was going to get! He drove me to the car lot, told me the price was $25 a day. I needed the rental for 2 days so that’s $50. Went to sign paper work and charged me $150 deposit. I asked when will I get that back,(mind you that was never mentioned) he said in 5 days.  So he showed me which car I was getting and it was all banged up looked terrible and drove worse. It shook going 45mph gas was on E so I put in gas to half tank.  Finally got to my son’s house they were shocked I got that kind of condition of a car. The back tire was almost flat too.  Called them told them I was scared to drive it again to come get it! They wouldn’t!  Took the car back the day of the service before it started.  When I got back home I waited 9 days still no deposit in my account! I called, now I was told they submit deposits back on the 1st and the 15th of the month.  Also he said it would be 3 days to hit my bank after the 15th. So I waited no return yet now it’s the 20th of the month and nothing. So I called got an answering machine saying, I’m on the phone, leave your name and number I’ll call back in 15 minutes! This went on for 3 days they didn’t answer phone! I left messages for them to call and discuss this matter. Nope no such luck! This has been going on for a month on the first of October!  I got through to them using a friends phone and they hung up on me! I did call the BBB on them! They are scammers don’t go there! My bank wants to give me the money back and then go  after them!!!!  Not to remind you I was upset over the passing of my son and they knew this and they still screwed me over!!!!  REPEAT!!! DONT DEAL WITH THEM. I hope they are reading this, low life people to do this to a woman who just lost her son!!!!   They lIe to you, they steal from you!<//text>< user>

This place is a total scam!! Under no circumstance should you ever consider renting a car from these fraudsters. Desperate, I rented a car from them over Christmas. First, the car smelled of marijuana when I got in. Then I noticed a crack in the window, which I noted to them. After I returned the car, I was shocked to see that they took my full deposit and billed me for the window, which was over $700! I am now in the process of taking them to court. If anybody else on this review thread wants to join up in a class action law suite again this awful business, please let me know.< /review>

DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!!!! WARNING!!!! LAURA SANCHEZ lives in North County, she should be Thrown in prison along with the large bulky guy guy manager. He had on a Mickey Mouse shirt that was too big for them with the stain on it walking around with flip-flops. This place is a complete fraud they are going to be investigated by a federal agency and most likely indicted for fraud the South Dakota license plates on every car it’s such a sham scam they basically want you to pay cash that you can’t prove that you paid what you did with the credit card so always pay with a credit card if for some reason you decide to rent from this Hellish organization that I don’t even think they have a business license.< /Text>

They are thieves and liars, never rent from them, they are a set of criminals running this place, they need to be in jail, they steal your stuff, do not return the deposit and charge you an enormous price, stay away.. they are yet to return our deposit of 1000 $.. Sadly I never read the reviews before renting from them. Well I expected it like every other response, they would say we dont have a record of you renting from us, they never show you a contract of theirs, once you return the car, they show you all different fake contracts.. thieves.. they should be locked up</review>

WARNING- Ive been sick to my stomach since I've rented from this place. I was told it would be a 300$ deposit and 62$ to rent for the day. I explained we would be visiting my sister and he joked saying travel wherever and see what you can see now that you're here and can. Nothing more was explained and I assumed it was unlimited mileage. When I tried reading the contract he rushed me through and was like I promise you're ok. I saw he rang my card for 562.62$ and I immediately started crying. This was our last day of vacation and on my debt card. Nothing was brought up about how you had to pay more if you didn't have a Califronia license ... When I said I was uncomfortable he kept saying you'll have the refund tomorrow and not to worry. He said even if he tried refunding at that time it wouldn't be right back in.
Used the car for the day after not being comfortable and called around 9 am the next day to see when we needed to return it before being charged for another day and he told us we had till 7 pm till they close and no worries. Returned with no deposit back right away like promised and charged for another day.. not to mention 1$ a mile. It's now Wednesday, car was returned Sunday and still no deposit back.
I'm contacting my lawyer at this point & BBB. Writing to inform people to do their research before renting a car so they don't end up getting scammed like we did.

UPDATE- Now Thursday, still no deposit and now getting no reply back from company. Still haven't seen my receipt that I asked be emailed. Filed a report as this is now fraud. Was also recommend to get a new debt card.<//Review>

RIPOFF!! THEY PREY ON PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO WHERE ELSE TO GO TO RENT A CAR.
Rented a car over new years 2018. The only reason I rented  from this company is because they accept debit cards. Pre paid debit cards. They charged an exorbitant price for the old beater of a car, manual transmission, manual roll up windows, etc. Rented for 4 days and returned it on time before 9AM as instructed to do. In fact I was there before they opened the gate to the yard. Also returned the car with no damage, and more gas in it then was necessary. The employee who showed up noticed everything was fine and drove me to the trolley station near by. After over 10 days I still have not received my $500 dollars deposit money back into my account. Repeated calls asking for my refund, put on hold, disconnected, left messages, heard some lame excuse about how they only process deposits twice a month, which is B'S. Finally now almost 2 weeks the manager says that I took the car for one extra day, so he says He is.going to charge me.for an extra day, plus extra mileage when it was unlimited mileage rental, he says that I don't get any of my refund back. The 4 day rental was $525. Plus $500 deposit TOTAL $1,025. TOTAL RIPOFF DON'T RENT A CAR FROM THESE SCUM BAGS, EVER!!!!</review>

One of my worst car rental experiences. Horrible cars...old and nasty and bad gas mileage. They are very slightly cheaper than the name brand agencies at the airport itself, but the cars are so bad it's not worth it.

Also, the guy that works there was super rude. I told him that I was in a hurry  because he was moving very slowly and in response he snapped at me that if I'm in a hurry, I can leave. Obviously I couldn't leave since I was picking up my rental.

Also, this isn't right by the airport.

Trust the reviews. Car rental agencies usually suck, but this is the worst.

Response to reply:

Yes, I'm sure I rented. It's not good practice to pretend like real reviews are from fake customers. My confirmation code for my rental: AIRP-SAND-2124697</Text>

<review>This is the worst rental place I ever experienced and I definitely would NOT recommend this place to anybody.

1. This place don't even have shuttle service at airport!!! When you make reservation, it doesn't tell you that you need to call after you arrived and then they will come and pick you up at the airport. We arrived at airport, and waited at the rental shuttle lane for half hours until we realize we need to make some calls. We called, and they send somebody to pick us up and it took another half hour until the driver get to the airport.

2. We rented an economy car, and the driver who picked up from airport gave the the same car to up for rental and the gas was like quarter tank and they expect us to return it as quarter tank as well.

3. They only open from 9 AM to 5 PM, so if you have flight outside the time frame, you are screwed. We have to left the rental car on the curbside and take a taxi on our own fee in order to make the flight. The agent was so rude, and he told us "it's your own business to get to the airport, get a taxi or something, we won't open until 9 AM". And they even would hang up your phone.

4. They charge you extra money other than the rental fee shown on you reservation for unreasonable fee on your credit card even you returned the car the same condition as you rent it. We had an higher than normal rental fee when we checked our credit card bills and they would not refund it at all and their altitude were so bad.

As speaking, I would not recommend this place at all. Worst business and customer service ever and I will report to BBB as well.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>
<gmapID>0x80deab02d7758dd1:0xcc3d2215e95af8d0</gmapID><review>This place is horrible to not rent from them. I extended my rental by 2 days and for some reason my card was not working. I stayed in contact the whole time. I was told they were open 24 hours so I drove down there to make the payment to find out that they were closed. So I got a hotel just to find that the next morning they had my truck towed with over $2,000 cash in it and when I try to call them to find out if they had it towed nobody would answer my phone call or call me back for several hours. He left me stranded at the hotel about 40 minutes away Trump the lot where I rented it. I absolutely hate this place and I highly recommend that you do not rent from them they are unfair and do not care. I wish I could give them zero or negative< /review><user_name>Bran G< /user_name>< rate>

Total scam.  They advertise that they are shuttle bus to rental car center, but when you arrive at the center, you find out that they are off site.  They are located in Little Italy in downtown SD.  Their cars are not less than 2 years old.  Their lot looks like a used car lot.  Mine was a 2005 Toyota Corolla with over 222,000 miles.  Once there and reality sinks in that you are stuck in a city away from the airport and other car rental places, you feel trapped with limited options.  People are friendly so do I be mean and ask to be driven back to the airport or do I suck it up and drive the old car?  I was on a time crunch so I took the damn car.  After returning the car in the exact same condition that I got it in, with even more gas, they did not have a shuttle to take me to the airport.  I had to call Uber.  A few days later they charged my credit card $500 and sent me a bill saying I owed them $138.89 more for a windshield replacement that cost $638.89.  Total BS.  Don’t use this company.  They are a scam.  I’m reporting them to the better business bureau and hiring an attorney to get my money back.</Text>

The long and short of it is… These people are a SCAM BUSINESS. They will, every time, attempt to scam you out of your deposit, your rental rates, and anything else they can weasel out.

Regardless of the fact that the automobiles they rent are in disrepair, unsafe, and furthermore unclean, they are crooks and thieves.

So much so in fact that when I referenced this simple fact, of them being scam artists, to one of their employees his response was essentially one of “yeah, so what”.

I’m in the process of recuperating the money they scanned from me through Visa.

If I worked for the San Diego government or business commission I would have these people shut down immediately.<//text>

Wanted a cheaper vacation and this helped me out greatly (price of a hotel in S.D. per night is more than this rental for a week). Plus we had no worries of getting the car stolen. Will be talking about the Toyota Corolla for years to come. Made a great trip for my wife and I.< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>This is a serious WARNING: RUN!!! If I could get this place out of business and in jail I would. The only reason I'm bothering to write this review is so that other people don't make the same mistake I made. RUN!!! These people are scammers and criminals!!! They'll offer you an OLD beat up Toyota and if you decline and ask for a decent reliable car they'll raise the price and you'll end up paying more for a dangerously bad vehicle than you would have for a good car with one of the bigger reputable companies. I was already stranded at their trailer office and ended up getting screwed. NOTE: They don't give the required maintenance to their cars. I almost killed myself when their car blew a tire on the road. The tire repair shop told me that all the tires where dangerously BOLD... I called the owner who told me to pay for the new tire so I could get back on the road but he never refunded my money like he said he would. Never answered my calls. They don't care about your safety or good business practices. Please, stay safe and don't go there.< /Review>< pictures>

I am leaving one star because zero is not an option.
They are basically crooks. They take a $500 deposit when you rent and say they will return it when you return the car. Then we returned the car and they said they had to wait until the 15th to process the refund (not what we were originally told).  This was not true either. The 15th came and went and we still didn’t receive a refund for the $500 deposit.
I had to call multiple times over the course of a month to finally get my refund. They dodged my calls and ignored my requests for calls back. When they finally processed the return I posted the review, at which point someone from the shop called and started screaming at me about my review and told them they were going to pull my refund back. Had to contest the charge through my credit card instead. Still waiting on resolution.
Cars were poor quality. The one we rented was filthy when we picked it up.
I would definitely not recommend using this service. It is absolutely not worth the savings you think you may be getting.</text>< Pics>

Found old food at the bottom of the seat I assume from the previous people who rented it. And they took forever to give the security deposit back. I suggest just make a car rental reservation at a more professional place. And no the car was dirty with barely any gas. I was honest about where I went and NO it wasn't returned with any damage.

<review>Never ever rent a car from this guys, I repeat myself, never ever rent anything from this guys!!! They are pure hustlers!!! They will rip you off!! I rented a car from the platform "Turo" and ended there... The guy asked for my credit card and how much Turo invoiced me, which you never have to do when using Turo, it smelled like scam... As I refused he was calling a guys back and forth to explained the situation, hang up the phone and told me to leave, very very rude, I’m not kidding!!! Then I told him I’m gonna call the police and he changed completely his behaviour and after 2 min he told me that we are all good and I can take keys of the car and go... I told him he can keep his car, I’m cancelling everything and calling Turo to report the situation! Real hustlers!!!

To Airport Car Rental: You are answering that it seems I never rented a vehicle from you... Yes, this is what I'm explaining above, I cancelled on site with Turo... All the comments on your company are similar experiences and the only response you have is to say that "you did not find my rental information", are you for real??? Any potential customers who will check on you before renting will be able to read all these comments from different people and have their own opinion if they should rent a car from you or not... Companies like your should not be allowed to operate at all!!!<//review><date>1551731701008< /date><Gmap_id>0x80deab02d7758dd1:0xcc3d2215e95af8d0< /Gmap_id><name>Vadim Couthon</name>< rating>

Avoid at all cost!  Cannot rate them any lower as 1 star is the worst allowed.  My 'rental' was a 99 Toyota with 151k miles, no ac, no radio, not even a working fan.  It smelled like mold to the point I had to purchase Fabreeze to negate the odor.  The interior was literally falling apart, as evident from the pictures.  Engine constantly rattled and sounded like it was about to shut down.  (ComicCon was in town and this was the only thing available).  They not only charged my credit card the rental fee, but an additional 500.00 which I'm STILL waiting to be refunded.   When I call to inquire about the charge, they simply hang up on me and subsequent calls go directly to voice mail.  Even better, ANOTHER 50.00 charge showed up on my card FIVE DAYS after the rental was returned, with no explanation.  The customer service on the phone is unbelievably rude (when they do answer) and refuse to return calls when messages are left on voice mail.  You will do much better paying for UBER or the additional cost for a better known and much more reliable rental agency.  Easily the worst rental company I have EVER dealt with.  If you have to use them, check your credit card on a daily basis.< /review>

< Review>
They scammed me of 700$ for a deposit. I told them I was going to Vegas they seemed fine with it 2 weeks have passed and o still have yet to see my deposit returned and I spoke with the manager a week ago and he said we file paper work on the 1st and 15th I called today and they said I went over the mileage? But I have yet to see my deposit refunded whether there was a fee?I spoke with him a week ago and he did not say one thing aboutgoing over the mileage.?? I am contacting the police and the better business bureau. This fraudulent company is going to come to a end. Do not rent from them. They are the lowest of low scum  bag car rental company</Review>

<review>Worst car rental agency in San Diego!!! Don't use this company! I reserved a doge grand Caravan or equal model and I received a 1999 Toyota Sienna with 160,000miles, the engine light on and the gas tank on empty with the light on. They told me to just return the car with the same amount of gas as I got it. Well I'm a responsible person who isn't going to drive his family around town with a car with the gas light on and end up running out of gas. So upon return the company ended up getting free gas from me. The van reeked of cigarett smoke and the carpet was stained. I thought I was getting a new rental car like normal rental agencies have but I was sadly mistaken. If there was not a cancellation fee I would have just walked off the lot. Don't be confused by the name airport rental car. It's not at the airport. When I returned the car I had to drop it off early in the morning due to my early flight so they had me leave it at a parking garage and then charge me $35 out of my security deposit. I turned in the car a little dirty but nothing a normal vacuum wouldn't take care as a normal rental company would do. Instead they charged me an extra $160 to shampoo all the carpets. This place is a total rip off. Please don't use this company! I thought I was saving money but turns out I didn't and had a terrible experience.Also they rarely answer their phone and the website won't load the webpage links. I wish I would have seen the reviews before making my reservation. Never again!</review>< pictures>

Looks like the feeling is mutual here with a 1.6 Star rating, you definitely get what you pay for.  Not only did my $100 a week car rental cost $50 for 1 extra day (I called ahead, 2 times to request the the change with no call back and then was told that the terms were written on the agreement which was conveniently hand scribbled and illegible).  Now my deposit is being held.  I was told when I dropped the car off it was being processed and would take 3-5 days to hit my account.  I called on the 5th day and then was told they are only processed on the 15th and 1st of the month so now I get to wait another 3-5 days from then.  Is that even legal?</text>

Hello everyone
Never ever rent a car from this company, they give you a vehicle with many issue and then they claim from your insurance company.
Very rude manager and staff. Don’t care about the lowest price because they will charge you more with many wrong reason.
They never return your deposite, I rent a car from that company and returned it on time with no issu but they never refund my deposite.
Don’t deal with that company.
Be careful .< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>DO NOT RENT FROM HERE. Does not even deserve one star. Very disappointed. I left something in the car and when I called the morning after we returned the car when they opened, I was told that the car had been rented and they did not check the car when it was returned. Cars should be vacuumed and cleaned when returned. We had been to the beach so there was sand in the seats and floor. Also it took over two weeks to get our safety deposit back, only after going back to the place to make sure it was done. It should not be that much trouble. I doubt they would have given the money back had we not of gone back. I would NOT recommend using this place.</Text></record>

< review>
Rented from them awhile ago, but recently found the credit card dispute form needed to get back the $196 they attempted to steal the day after I returned the car.
The car was very worn when we picked it up.  It was one of two offered that were equally run down.  Car had no gas (marked as "E" on paperwork).  They asked for a bunch of info that you never have to provide at reputable vendors.  Returned the vehicle without damages, and no receipt was provided at the time of return.  The guy stated someone else (who wasn't there) would take care of it.  I made the guy write "no additional charges" on my copy.  Never gave me the carbons for the charge slip/form they still use (circa 1992).  Then they used the charge form the next day to attempt to steal an additional $196.  Had to dispute this charge threw my credit card because ACR wasn't helpful.  After a couple weeks, I won the dispute and received my money back.
I would rather quite literally walk than rent anything from them again.  I would never recommend anyone use this company, and by the looks of the other reviews, my review is not an outlier.  Long story short, horrible company.  Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else...</review>

Well let me tell you a story . we went on line to rent a car for 6 days and goggled our dates . A+ came up along with all the normal care rental agencies.  The price was fair $150.99 for a compact or midsized car and stated the location was at the San Diego International Air port.  When we got to the airport there was no rental car agencies there but had shuttles to a offsite car center. So we got aboard no problem yet. When we arrived A+ was not there and we ask for information on how to find them. We were told to go to a sign way down the plaza and shuttles will pick you up. We sat there for 1 hr no shuttle for A+ came by. We then called the number on the paperwork and a gentleman ask us where we were and would send someone over to get us. 15 min later he arrived in a old beat up Saturn. We drove to San Diego's little Italy and stopped at a corner rent a wreck the newest  car was maybe a 2001. The 2 workers were very nice and even offered us a upgrade. They pulled it out for me to inspect it was a white full-size 2001 Grand Marquis with 185,000 miles on it the headliner was hanging down every door was dented looked like it had been in a demolition derby interior bad ETC. I told him I sell cars like this for $500.00 to the junk yards. Then they offered me another upgrade to a Mercedes for $100.00 more I looked at it and it was a 2001 faded paint faded headlights looked old had over 150,0000 miles on it and not something I would take my friends to dinner in. so I ask them to just take me back to the rental hub and end this nightmare. The 2 workers were still very nice and gave me and my wife a ride back saying I would still be charged for the no cancellation fee. At this point I could care less just get me out of here. I wound up renting a new Nissan compact for $140.00 total from pay less. Like I said the 2 employees were very nice and we will see what happens on my no cancellation fee.</Review>

<review>$500 deposit is ridiculous for a rental, especially for the selection of cars they have. And on top of that, I only needed two days. I booked through turo, have never had to pay a deposit through them. My suggestion, rent from private parties through turo, if you see the car associated with a rental company, click next.</review>< pictures>

ZERO STARS!  RUDE AND A RIP OFF.  Good luck trying to get anyone on the phone that isn't rude and doesn't just hang up on you mid-conversation. This place charged me $20 per day in insurance, which is ridiculous and was not mentioned on the phone.  Offered to give me a ride to the airport less than 2 miles away for $35.  I declined because an Uber was under $7.  The day after I brought the car back they called me and complained they'd been trying to reach me and I hadn't answered, but I had no voicemails or missed calls from them.  They stated there was a scratch on the bumper and a crack in the windshield. They did not check the vehicle when I was actually there returning it, and I explained that I had received the car unwashed, so perhaps these were already on the vehicle but not visible due to dirt covering them.  Even so, didn't the $20 per day insurance cover this?  I rented a car in Orlando in January and $15 per day insurance covered any damage to the car.  They charged me a $300 deposit, and on top of that, charged me $500 the day after I returned the car before they even spoke to me regarding the damage.  I've been trying to talk to them about this to obtain a copy of my insurance policy and itemization of charges, but every time I call they either do not answer or abruptly hang up on me telling me to call back later (even during hours in which they are open).</review>

<Review>Would have given zero stars if I could. Such a horrible place to rent from. There was no one at the lot when we tried to drop our car off at the end. Upon calling it was, "The driver is dropping someone off at the airport they'll be there in 10 min". 20 minutes later, it was he drove to La Jolla and is stuck in traffic, you should just uber to the airport" They refused to pay for our Uber and then hung up on us. DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM THEM!< /Review>< Name>

Please stay away. These guys are scammers and will ignore all your calls. I had rented a minivan for $56 a day for 1 day and everything was fine until they took $421 dollars from my security deposit. Mind you this van was an old toyota sienna and the AC barely worked with over 200000 miles on it. I kept calling and calling to try and resolve this issue but continued to be ignored even when i walked into the lot. They claim that i drove over 400 miles(in one day) and had smoked in the car(which i didnt, because who is stupid enough to do that in a rental?!). I am currently waiting for a response from the BBB and in the process of taking this to small claims court to get this resolved. Do not fall for their “low pricing”<//Review>

Terrible place to rent! They gave us a car that had many scratches and had a tremendous amount of dog hair! We got a different car and it didn't even have any gas! The car also needed 3 quarts of oil! After all this, we called for answers and they would not answer. We also returned the car a day earlier than was said because of how bad the service was, and yet they still charged us for the extra day! be warned, this place is a total ripoff! Avoid at all costs!< /text>

If I could give zero stars I would. This is the worst experience I've ever had renting ANYTHING! The customer service first of all was horrible. So unprofessional. On one occasion we had come to make a payment and waited for 20 mins only to find out that the guy wasn't even there, let's keep in mind that we had called before we came and we made an appointment. Getting my deposit back was another hassle that I had no time for. I basically had to threaten them to get my deposit back which by the way they told me I'd get back because nothing was wrong with the car. Almost 3 months later they finally gave it back only after I had called every single day. This place was a zero for me . I'll never go back and I don't recommend any one go to them<//text>

<review>Never rent a car here, cars might look good but they break down 2 hours after driving with them. Then, you are screwed : spending half day to make them understand the problem and the car to be towed and finally, they don't provide you neither another car in the same category, nor even a refund! No offices to go to and when you call them they keep telling you to call back or that they have to speak with the manager!
To our minds, it's a fake and thief car rental, please don't go there!<//review>< pictures>

before my plane took off en route to San Diego i checked Kayak and all the major car rental places were price gouging for over $200 for a one day rental on a compact car. By the time i landed, there was nothing left. started calling down every listing on Google Maps, finally found this place and was a bit apprehensive due to the reviews but i called anyway. Guy said i was in luck and he had a car for $70 for the day. the deposit was a bit high at $500 but i did get it back. the car was in rough shape but it ran and didnt break down. seems from the other reviews and talking with the business owner during rental, most of the people who lost their deposit either brought the car back with damage or didnt tell the rental car company where they were going. i was upfront with where i was going and they were fine with it.<//text>

DO NOT ENTER!!!!!! This place is a total scam shack… First off the website shows you nice new cars, but when you show up its a pot lot with really old $200 cars for rent. The car we got was a 1999 toyota sienna with 164,000 miles on it worth about a nickle, which they do not disclose online! The first time i turned the car off it wound not start again for a few hours but i did finally get it started again. We paid around $300 for 4 days which is only a little less than Avis. They made us give them a $500 deposit for the car which wound most likely pay for the whole inventory of this place! Okay no big deal i had to make the guy write refundable by the $500 charge and he did not like that at all. When i gave them the card they managed to lose the card for 15 min while pretending to look for it while the other guy wrote the back numbers down under the counter… Haha what a goof ball!!! Anyway when i turned the car back in, the lady said alright everything is good, your good to go…..

Four days later however i noticed a $102.65 charge on my card from the rental company. I called to ask, hi i still have not gotten my deposit back and for some reason and there is another charge on my card from 4 days after the return of the car. Do you know why? Can you hold sir? yes! Then she hung up the phone. This continued for the next 2.5 weeks so i contacted my bank to file fraudulent charges against the company, and they said it would take a few weeks but i should still try to contact them to get it worked out so today over three weeks later i finally got in contact with them, only to let me know that the $102.65 they have no idea what they used that for, but as far as my deposit goes they needed to use the $500 deposit for a few scratches they found on the car over three weeks after i turned it in…. Hahahaah I'm not sure but maybe its from the last people you tried to scam out of $602.65 for a car that is almost worthless!

The dealer board should really investigate a place with this many one star complaints against it. We all can't be wrong, this place should be shut down and does not deserve a star rating.<//review>

They took our 500$ security and asked us to pay 680$ above that because we went to vagus for 3 days without informing them. If u r renting for a month then its better to buy a car for 1500-2000$. U will get a reasonable car in this price from craigslist. Most of the cars which this shop has are from 1000$-2500$.< /Review>< Resp>

FRAUD. FRAUD. FRAUD...
they will steal your security deposit

I rented a car from here for $750/month including full insurance, it was corolla 2007. The guy took 750 rent + $500 security (all cash). When i came to return car , he said you went to vegus without informing us and refused to return my security deposit of $500 and called cops. Cops came and refused to help me saying we can't do anything, it's your private matter so deal with it. This is how they took all my $500 security deposit, THIEVES, THIEVES, THIEVES< /Text>

Ok first of all the prices they advertise aren't what you pay, so know when you go pick up a car plan on being overcharged, make sure you do a walk through of the car because they won't, and most importantly make sure that they emphasize how they will give your deposit back, because I didn't receive mine, oh and they won't call you back nor will they answer the phone, good luck</review>

SCAM   - car has been returned with no damage but they never returned a deposit  of 500 $. So by the end of the day I have paid 50$ per day for a car, plus 500$ as additional cost. Europeans -BEWARE - they know you will not be back to pick it up personally.  This place needs to get shut down by police !!!!!!!!!<//text>

< Review>
I reserved a car on Feb 26 to Mar 1 2017. They gave me a 210k+ miles Honda Accent, with check engine light flashing. But even though such a poor value car, apparently the car was dear enough for them to charge a insurance even though I denied it (I would have been happy to pay whatever damage on that piece of junk, I mean even if it gets totaled I would not had to pay more than 500 bucks). Anyways, the car was faulty enough that I had to return it the same day. So basically for 3 hours I had to shell out 78 bucks. The only thing I would like to write is, scamming people with literally hidden paperwork is quite an old process and it was my fault I stepped in it. I just hope that some other potential customer reads this review and does not do a future transaction< /Review>

<Review>HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE **AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST**
Cheap,but crappy cars for rent at a sleazeball place. They claimed my car was hit, but there were already so many dents, it was hard to tell. BOTTOM LINE: they take a $300 deposit and even when your claim is settled by insurance, they will not return the $300, TOTAL RIPOFF, AVOID!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!< /Review>< Date>

Worst car rental ever. Considering that I have rented cars for decades all around the world, including Africa, this is quite a statement.

When I started the car in the dusk of 7 pm, the headlights wouldn't seem to turn on. Attendant told me the sensor would kick in soon. Left the agency as it closed. Quickly discovered that the only way to get any headlights was to turn on the fog lights. And there were no dashboard lights. Dashboard brightness thumbwheel did not work. Yes, I stopped and checked the manual. To get to my destination that evening I had to drive on the freeway with no dashboard lights. The only way I could monitor my speed was to turn on the interior lights for a few seconds. This was not good for my night vision and felt scary.

The door locks also did not work properly. The keys were manual (no remote). The key could not lock the car from the driver door. But the key did work on the passenger door, but only to lock the car. So I had to lock the car on the passenger door and unlock it on the driver door. And I had only one key, so had to be extremely careful not to lock the key in the trunk as the lid would drop by itself.

Also, I received the car with the gas gauge at 1/4, but didn't notice until I was on the road. Not sure if the gas gauge was also not working properly, I stopped and gassed up. That cost $40, much of which was wasted as I only had to return it with 1/4 tank. OK, that was partly my fault for overfilling the tank, but what kind of rental company gives you a car with only 1/4 tank of fuel WITHOUT TELLING YOU? I'll let you answer that one.

The car I rented in San Diego, CA had South Dakota license plates. Why is that? When I returned the car, I noticed several others with South Dakota plates. My guess is this is how they manage to rent piece-o-crap cars at lowball prices in California. My advice is to refuse any car not licensed in CA. Better, rent elsewhere. After all, it is your life at risk.</text>

<review>Please don’t ever rent a car from this place. they cheat us out of $48, did not take us to the airport shuttle like promise, and cursed my brother out in front of my 5 year old saying he would beat my brother the f*** up when we questioned about the extra fee. We wanted to keep the car for an extra few hours and even called the place to confirm that we could and was told yes by the lady that answered the phone. We paid $230 for a week including the extra $48. We took the car on Monday morning and returned it Sunday afternoon. I had to ask my brother to call us an Uber to make our flight. I have never been treated this way in my life. I’m still shaking on my way to the airport.<//review>< time>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!!

We had reserved a car from Airport Car Rental (ACR) back in January. When we landed in San Diego, we did as instructed in their email and called their office. We then spoke to a lady, who asked for my name and cell phone number. She then told us that a car would pick us up in front of the Delta terminal in 15 minutes to then drive us back to the rental location. We waited for 25 minutes before I decided to call ACR back. No one picked up the first 2 tries, but I finally, on the third attempt, got a hold of someone who simply whispered into the phone "Call me back in 20 minutes" and hung up. Obviously I couldn't afford waiting 20 minutes on the side of the street, so I called back. No one picked up. At this point, we went to another rental agency and rented a car. We never heard from ACR again, which is quite unbelievable considering ACR was supposed to have someone pick us up. Over a month passed without issue until ACR recently charged us $20 for no apparent reason. There should be no fee because ACR failed to deliver their promised service. Even if they tried to argue a "cancellation" fee, that is only a fee of 1 day, or $8, per their contract.

I tried to discuss the issue with them numerous times, but each time I called, either no one picked up, or they hang up on me after I began describing the issue. Their service is so poor and frankly their business is on the cusp of being legally fraudulent.

They’re likely going to reply to this review and try to pin the entire thing on me.  The facts above are the true facts, so you decide whether saving a few extra dollars by renting from them is worth the hassle.  In hindsight, it certainly wasn’t for me.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Worse car rental place EVER!!! Do not rent from here.  They rent used vehicles with damage.  They have crossed out where you can mark this damage down on their rental agreement form.  They will then keep part or all of your security deposit to pay for "new" damage.</Review>

!!!DON'T RENT FROM THIS PLACE.!!
avoid an argument with these idiots an rent from a real business like herts, or rentacar. they claim that the car i returned was damaged and they wouldnt return my deposit. i went back to look at the car and the manager told me the car was fine. weeks later i still dont have my deposit and they keep saying that the car is damaged even tho it had dents and scratches when i rented it.
we paid full cover to avoid this and still they keep saying the same thing. these people are scammers and need to be jailed.
go somewhere else. save yourself a headache. you will end up paying more than a big car rental place<//Text>

I have to blame myself partially bc this place gave me a bad vibe from the start.  The guy almost fell out of his chair when I walked in, I don't think he'd seen a customer in a long time.  I didn't follow that initial hesitation and I paid for it triple fold in the end.  This place is as sketchy as they come.  The cars are junk, and the contract might as well be written on a napkin.  The car was on E when I picked it up from the lot.  I returned it with a quarter tank and they charged me for gas.  The car ran like dog $h!¥ the entire trip.  The wheels weren't ballanced correctly and it nearly shook itself off the road at interstate speeds.  The interior was filthy, and not just stained carpet but dirt and debris all over the floor.  When I returned the car everything was OK'd and I was told there were no problems.  Four days later my credit card was charged $90 and I recieved no explanation.  When I tried to get in touch with their office I was told to call back and hung up on, multiple times.  You need to speak w a woman I'll call "Jane".  Jane answers the phone, she puts you on hold but never comes back. When you call back a man answers and says "Jane had to leave, call back in an hour".  If you try to ask him any further questions, he hangs up on you.  If you call back in an hour, they start this exact cycle all over again.  I experienced this 5 times before deciding to contact my bank for help.  It's a nightmare, please don't waste your time or money.  These "people" are two bit thieves fronting as a business.  ***YOU'VE BEEN WARNED***< /text>

Awful people, SCAMMERS! Same story as others, cheap car rental (for an awful car), then get charged $500 a few days later! Do NOT come here to save $10 a day, will cost you much more in the end! HOW DO WE REPORT THESE CRIMINALS??< /Review>

CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Terrible service. The car was dirty (old fries between the seat and center console) and had an empty gas tank when I received it. When I finally returned the car, I didn't receive my deposit until 8 days, 2 phone calls, and one visit later. I had to get my bank involved to get my money back. NEVER USE THIS COMPANY.</review>

I learn my lesson now so next time I will spend an extra $10 or $15 renting a car from the airport location.<//review>< pics>

I would not rent a car from this agency again.  Cars are very old.  They gave me a 1996 Acura Integra with only one headlight. They also promised me a weekly rate of $190 but took an additional $90 out of my $500 deposit because they said the car was turned in late even though the car was turned in on time within the seven day period.< /Text>

<text>If I could rate them zero I would do so , A TOTAL SCAM, they are not communicating the terms of the contract with you, and ask you to sign a an old piece of paper with not so readable handwriting on it and hold your deposit for no good reason, it looks cheap for the price as it is advertised but even the price is not cheaper than other car rentals, DO NOT TRUST THEM AT ALL, go to well known other companies with good reputation!</text><resp>None</resp></record>

This place is a total scam. The cars are old and in poor condition.
They kept my 500$ deposit and even charged me an extra 215$ without any explanation. I called multiple times to get an explanation to these amounts and no-one ever wanted to give me any information.
I had to challenge these extra charges through my credit card company to have more info. They sent them a copy of an altered rental agreement saying we brought back the car late (which we didn't) and charged us a dollar for each extra mile over 25 miles while there was no mileage limit when we signed the agreement.

Worst company ever! They charged me the deposit of 500 for the "scratches" on the car. . However, they charged me a day before we even returned the car. They called me the day AFTER we returned it to notify me that they were going to take my deposit and the owner never called me. This place needs to be shut down. I wish I'd read the reviews. I am still waiting for my bank to handle this situation and it has been over 2 months. :( turned my 1 and only vacation into hell.< /text>

I returned the car on time in the state I received it and they stole my $300 deposit,  claiming they didn't charge me a deposit.  They then withdrew an additional $300 from my bank account 5 days later without my permission.  So far they've stolen a total of $600 from me.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) In a few words is a company that is dedicated to the swindling of people, they ask for a supposed high retention of money which is not more than a deposit that they do not return in the "dates" that they propose ... not to go please and as a recommendation go to dirt cheap car rental very professional people and good quality cars without any "deposit" or retention any. In my case I signed a supposed "contract" (which gave me an incomplete copy), a week for a corolla that was practically rusting for a value of 300 and a deposit ("retention") of 300 dollars (auto who did not even take the time to show us) for clear reasons I returned the car to only one day of use and they did not reimburse me for a single peso of what I paid and even today I do not get back the supposed retention.

For more information the alleged owner calls herself MARIA and the sangano she has working in the branch which I think should be her husband (something fat and with a mole on her face) is the one that is dedicated to attracting people and cheating them (both of Mexican nationality) .-

I INVITE ALL PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS PUBLICATION AND WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN SCAMED TO GIVE A FEW MINUTES TO DENOUNCE THIS SUPPOSED COMPANY, DOWN FROM THE TELEPHONE NUMBER APPEARS THE OPTION "SUGGEST AN EDITION" AND SELECT "REMOVE THIS PLACE" AND REASON FOR " SPAM, OFFENSE AND FALSE "

To emphasize that he is not even at the airport and they call themselves airport stupidity ...

I hope to have them helped in some way so that they do not go through what I do. Greetings .-

En pocas palabras es una empresa que se dedica a la estafa de gente, piden una supuesta retencion elevada de dinero el cual no es mas que un deposito que no devuelven en las "fechas" que ellos proponen... no ir porfavor y como recomendacion ir a dirt cheap car rental personas muy profesionales y autos de buena calidad sin ningun "deposito" ni retencion alguna. En mi caso yo firme un supuesto "contrato" (el cual me dieron una copia incompleta), de una semana por un corolla que practicamente se estaba oxidando por un valor de unos 300  y un deposito ("retencion") de 300 dolares (auto que nisiquiera se dieron el tiempo de mostrarnos) por motivos claros devolvi el auto a solo un dia de uso y no me reembolsaron ni un solo peso de lo que page e incluso hasta del dia de hoy no me devuelven la supuesta retencion .-

Para mas informacion la supuesta dueña se hace llamar MARIA y el sangano al cual tiene trabajando en la sucursal el cual creo debe ser su esposo(algo gordo y con un lunar en la cara) es el que se dedica a captar a la gente y estafarlos (los dos de nacionalidad mexicana).-

INVITO A TODAS LAS PERSONAS QUE VEAN ESTA PUBLICACION Y A QUIENES YA HAN SIDO ESTAFADOS A DARSE UNOS MINUTOS PARA DENUNCIAR ESTA SUPUESTA EMPRESA , ABAJO EN DE EL NUMERO TELEFONICO APARECE LA OPCION "SUGERIR UNA EDICION" Y SELECCIONAR "QUITAR ESTE LUGAR " Y MOTIVO POR "SPAM , OFENCIVO Y FALSO"

Destacar que nisiquiera esta en el aeropuerto y se hacen llamar airport una estupidez...

Espero averlos ayudado de alguna manera para que no pasen por lo que yo pase Saludos .-< /review>< pics>

Pool #2 Gardenhouse is well maintained and monitored. The security guard, Jeremiah, does a phenomenal job! He was very helpful and patient by helping us and showing us how the reservation system works! Thank you for having an awesome staff!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>We joined the gardening club to get the family out together. This is perfect for families or individuals.

The heavy lifting is done by the employees but they are very patient and teach you planting techniques, plant care and when to plant seasonally.

The kids have a great time getting their hands dirty and the adults have fun learning something new. Everyone we met has a smile.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

If you decide you would be willing to give us another try,  please feel free to call ahead or use the mobile app to schedule a reservation.

< Review>
I do highly recommend this Supercuts. I've been going to this Supercuts for years. Rosy (Rosie?) the Manager is who I prefer but the others are patient to my instructions & pay attention to details. I get a modified fade w/ long bangs for my curly hair & am more often than not very satisfied.
Go on a Tuesday when they take ($5?) off. Their COVID-19 safety protocols has changed some things. Now you can't make an appointment for the day until you arrive in person so your temperature can be taken.</Review>

<gmap_id>0x80c2594336f0558d:0x81190f053e404568</gmap_id><Review>I just got my haircut to donate it. And it’s supposed to be at least 10 inches well I asked for 12 off . And as soon the stylist , Romona, cut my hair she started cutting more and more off. I specificically asked for it to be mid-shoulder length. And she proceeded to cut off at least another 4 inches. I now have a bob instead of hair to my shoulders. I will never go back there. And to top it off, Romona pulled the earring OUT of my ear and didn’t even care to tell me or say anything. I wish I could give this place less than 1 star. Hardly even worthy of 1.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I came here with my brother to get his hair shaved. It's a welcoming and calming environment. For manly guys, the straight razor shaving is the facial. It's a wonderful feeling. There's nothing like a hot towel on your skin or the manly scent of shaving cream to instantly relieve tension. We were overjoyed when we returned home. He said he liked his new haircut. It comes highly recommended!< /text>< pics>

This shop was the best! I came here last Tuesday to ask haircut, and the barber did a great job on it. As a satisfied customer, I will promise to come back. The place was clean, comfortable, and smell great. Besides, this shop was a perfect place to visit again and again. Thank you so much! I so much appreciate the efforts!</review>

I'm quite sure this is the right place. I came for a haircut, and they rudely said they only accept appointments, and claimed to be booked solid, despite having no visible customers anywhere around.< /review>

Been getting my hair cut by Victor since I moved here from Hawaii 15 years ago. Great barber and friend. He and his wife Elizabeth have always been kind and hospitable. I greatly appreciate the effort and skill they put into their lively hood.

I've been to many barbershops in LA and it's easy for me to say that Victor is one of the best. He takes his time to make sure you get the results you request.  One of my favorite things about James Barber Shop is how diverse the clientele is. You see Asians, Latinos, African-american, etc all coming here to get a high quality hair cut. This place is an LA landmark and has stood the test of time and will continue to do so.

I do like to try out other barbers on occasion based on recommendations from friends but I always return here where Quality and Consistency is King.<//Text><GmapID>0x14e1b14b311075e3:0x9bd0ba6a0d6a2607<//GmapID>< response>

It's also nice that after all these years we still stack up to the other barbers here in LA you've tried. Thanks for letting us know!"}</response>

I’ve been to a ton of different barbers, with wide ranges in quality, but the haircut I got from Victor here was surprisingly good for the price.
Victor really took his time and it was clear that there was a lot of attention to detail going on. A long process but without a doubt a thorough one.
It felt like I got a little more hair cut off than what I wanted, I wanted around a half inch off but it seemed closer to a full inch off but honestly, Im still cool with it because it looks great. And that could just be me!
Overall though, the actual location is nice, Victor was attentive and diligent, and the haircut was great.
If I ever find myself back in LA again, I’ll definitely hit this place up.< /Text>

Very meticulous barber. If you expect a quick haircut, this is not the place for you. If you like a good, detailed haircut, go check it out. Need to reserve online though.< /Review>

<user>115266348956150636892<//user><text>Called this morning (Wed @ 9.10am), asked how much are haircuts, and I was told $30 cash only. I advised the person who answered the phone, I'd be on my way. I was told is by appt only and they're booked today. Really? Is probably better to put a sign out there, "We are NOT taking new business."< /text>< Rate>

<Text>Horrible shop. Incredibly rude, plays favorites with appointments if you can even set one up. Takes up to an hour or more for a simple haircut. Waste of money. Huge mistake setting foot in this place.</Text><Resp>{'time': 1551752628227, 'text': 'Sorry for your experience Matthew. As I mentioned when you came by, and as the sign at the door says we are appointment only. We also take pride in our haircuts so yes they do take about an hour. If I would have taken you on a drop in it would have made me late for my next appointment. I hope you understand and I hope to see you again...next time just schedule online through our website.'}<//Resp></record>

Stopped in to have a check engine light diagnosed.
Counter person told me the problem and a parts estimate. Good place to go without someone trying to sell you extra parts.</Text>

I just spent a extra $20 more on a hose I could have ordered online BUT I have it now and not a week later. You just can't beat that especially when you need the parts right away.

You know im not gonna down the store because of one guys attitude but everyone but the person who resurfaces the rotors is great when one employee asked for an estimate on time for the task to be completed a sarcastic remark was the answer "when i get done with the other ones " dude if you dont like your job find another dont ruin it for the store and i also waited 4 hrs for my rotors to be resurfaced just made me feel like i was a burden not a customer<//Review>

This place gave me the run around to return an item and sent me to multiple stores wasting my time and gas. Still did not get the refund because none of them can do anything without the manager holding their hand. Poor excuse for an auto parts store. Autozone for now on.</review>

<review>An awesome place to take family and friends for breakfast. The breakfast bar ( all you can eat! ) has an amazingly large selection of meats, potatoes and breakfast goodies.  The service was wonderful and the waitress was helpful with every request asked of her.
the prices were very fair, and the regular main menu selection offered a large number of unique choices.</review></record></dataset><record>

Great food great atmosphere. Dog friendly outdoor seating and friendly people. Ever their busboys are super helpful. If you want a down home feel and super portions a must go. Be prepared this place is cash only, they do have an ATM on site and a bank of America ATM within walking distance.< /text>

great local restaurant that has been here forever! Super friendly staff, great service and great food. They also have a delicious buffet. The buffet has special hours so make sure to check ahead.

This place is cash only which is frustrating but they still get a lot of business. There is a b of a atm next door< /text>

With a sweet staff and homey vibe, Mollies has never failed to get my order wrong or burn my food. The food is overpriced and advertised online at a lower price. With a menu that has copious amounts of meat I believe they may have something against vegetarian dishes.</text>

Bring cash. They only take cash. Friends and I went here during brunch time. You're able to either help yourself to the buffet or buy breakfast/lunch from the menu. Both are tasty options. I ordered from the menu and received a large portion of food. It was quick too.< /text>

I love going to Molly's, I've been going there for years.  It is food I know I'll like every time, consistently good food.  The servers are amazing, the volume that they deal with and still treat us with kindness.  We come from Capitola to Scott's Valley just for Molly's. It is a true cafe experience which I love.

<Text>The food was okay. I got a dirty fork and a steak 30% of which were fat. They don't accept cards and make you withdraw cash from an ATM they host.
Most other people in the cafe seemed to be attending the place for the past 30+ years. So apparently they find something good about the place that I couldn't.<//Text>< username>

The cooks really make this place special. The foods great. The bussers are always prompt too refil coffee or clear plates. The servers are mostly rude and seem like they don't want to be there. Our recommendation is to sit outside. Where there is at least room around your seats. Other wise the servers will cram you into tiny booths right next to people you don't know.< /Text>

<Date>1506193335360<//Date><username>Wes F.< /username><Text>We decided to visit this place for breakfast based on their reviews. We waited for over an hour for our food to be served and our waitress never checked back with us at all.

The food was ok. It probably would have tasted better if we had decent service. After we were done we asked for a box and our waitress did not bring one back after 10 minutes. Finally we asked another member of the staff for a box who looked like he was 13 and he was nice enough to bring us a box.

When we went to the counter to check out, we were told that they didn't accept card and we could use their ATM in the back which they host and charge a fee to use.

This place is terrible and when you look at a lot of the reviews you can tell they are fake. Beware of this place. A lot of internet marketers will do fake reviews to boost a companies popularity in google for a nice fee.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><GmapID>0x808e40d27ba892b7:0x3237cde163cca7ae</GmapID><user_id>108535434071661569055</user_id><Rate>1< /Rate><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Your basic American breakfast,  nothing to write home about but good.  I appreciate that they have Worcestershire to pour over my biscuits and gravy.  By the way if you haven't tried Worcestershire on your biscuits and gravy you are missing out!< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Went there and I ordered the huevos rancheros, after asking if it was good or if I should get the shrimp special which looked really good.
I was told by our waitress the huevos rancheros were great.
What I got was nothing resembling anything near a traditional huevos rancheros that I've ever seen.
Wrong ingredients completely.
And it was dinky.
I mentioned to my waitress nicley that I was very disappointed in it.
She kind of gave me a dirty look and said oh okay and walked away.
I ate, paid the bill after the cold shoulder from her with a generous tip.
I will never be back there.
Nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone ever.<//Review>

Nothing super great but breakfasts and burgers are better than average and the staff is almost always friendly and quick.  I normally pay cash for meals but their lack of credit card acceptance can sometimes be inconvenient.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><userid>102567561542612159433</userid><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>The worst service in the county. I've been dining here for 5+ years, and the service has been getting worse and worse. I came in about 2:00 --- well after the lunch rush, but still a good hour before closing. I had to steer the hostess away from seating me at a table with others (!!), as if a party of one doesn't deserve a private place to sit. When my order was finally taken and served, no one ever returned to see if my meal was okay, to bring me a check --- no one even refilled my coffee! There were plenty of waitresses milling about, so I find the lack of common restaurant courtesy to be just plain laziness and bad manners on their part. The waitresses seemed much more interested in filling the jelly baskets and the salt shakers and talking to one another than they were in helping a bona-fide customer. I work too hard for my money to waste it in this restaurant ever again. I won't be back. They get one star only because zero stars is not an option.<//Text><response>None<//response>< name>

So so diner.  Buffet is usually not that good.  Made to order menu much better.  Service can be lacking.  Once sat at the bar for 20 mins before I got served....oh wait, I didn't.  So, I got up and left.</Review>

Two orders of raw pancakes? Not so good. The eggs and other stuff were ok, but can you trust a kitchen that can’t make a pancake? They  also are cash only, a little inconvenient.<//review>

<text>Was brought here by my overnight host after a fun evening of DJ Hero and Dance Central (? i just know you play it on Kinect)

Their french toast came highly recommended by our host, so, French toast I ordered.  And french toast is DELICIOUS!!!!  It is not your regular french toast made out of bread, it almost seemed like I'm eatin cake, yet its not as airy as cake,  but its not exactly pancake either b/c its not so buttery or battery.  I can't quite put my finger on it except, This is what all french toast should taste like!!!

The service is also SUPER speedy.  the wait staff got it down to a science! You order and 5 minutes later, not even enough time for my quick pop in the bathroom and the food is on your table.  Not just ONE PLACE or food, but four plates for the table of four.  now THAT is speedy good service.< /text>< Pics>

It's still one of the house favorites, so we couldn't be happier that it hit all the right notes for you on flavor and texture. And thanks for the compliment on our speedy service, too!

10/10 Recommend. The office is super nice and the staff is even nicer. They offer such a great breakdown of estimated costs pre and post insurance and map out a treatment plan from high to low priority levels. It’s a super comfortable environment and the staff is super supportive of any anxieties and frequently checked comfort level.I am very happy with the overall experience provided.

Incredibly professional and above average cleanliness & hygiene. Couldn’t recommend more.< /text>

My first appointment at this location was a great experience. James who was at the frost desk is really nice his customer service was great I’ve visited other locations and let me tell you, first impressions are everything and he makes a very good one.

Dr. Tath really takes COVID-19 precautions seriously which I appreciate so much. The lobby has purifiers and mist that disinfects the area so I felt at ease, especially since he spaces out his appointments so only you are in the lobby.

Dr. Tath came out to greet me and showed me around the office while introducing himself which I appreciated it shows he cares.

I came went In today because of a toothache after I visited a different location in Tracy and so far he fixed the bite which alleviated some of the pressure I was having, I will follow is post visit instructions and fingers crossed it continues to feel better. I appreciate that he was able to fit me in so quick despite him being really busy because of my toothache, he explained everything so well and made me feel at ease with what will come next in my dental treatment.

I definitely recommend this location, you guys will not be disappointed!< /Review>

Mossdale Dental was one of the best dental offices I’ve encountered. Everything from the ambience, to the staff was remarkable. Dr. Tath truly cares about educating his patients and I felt like I was immediately apart of the family. I would recommend this place to anyone especially families with children.</Review>

From the moment you enter their office you are well taken care of. Everyone is very friendly and sincerely caring. They have state of the art equipment and it really is a wonderful team of professionals. I hate going to the dentist but honestly out of more than 40 years this was the best experience I have ever had and I am extremely grateful for their care in my dental work. I had lost a very large filling and the tooth was so painful and they got me in within minutes and on a Saturday.<//review>

< Review>
Best dental experience I have ever had. They take advanced COVID precautions with high tech filters placed throughout the office. The receptionist is very friendly and the dental hygienist really took her time to explain everything. The dentist came out to the waiting room, sat down and took the time to talk with me and explain their enhanced precautions that they have implemented. He took me through a tour of the facility prior to my exam. The dentist thoroughly explained all steps of the exam. He was very gentle and made sure that I was comfortable throughout the whole appointment. He explained my treatment options and insurance coverage. I did not feel pressured to purchase additional treatment. I will definitely bring my entire family here. Highly recommend!</Review>

This was my first visit. As a nervous Nellie about dentist visits, I was pleasantly surprised! Dr. That gave me a tour of his office and made me feel very at ease. He asked me about why I feel anxious about the dentist, which validated my concerns. Jocelyn and James were both very friendly as was Larisa. I highly recommend them and because of my experience, will continue to get the extensive work done that I need. 😊<//Text>

I took my two kids (4 and 6) to this dental office for the first time yesterday. Many precautions were in place to provide a sanitary environment. The staff was very friendly and Dr. Tath gave helpful advice on how to encourage and provide good oral hygiene for the kids. My only issue is that the appointment took 1.5-2 hours when my kids are used to 30-45 min. We spent some time meeting with the dentist and touring the facility which could have probably been done virtually beforehand to shorten the time. Also, each child was seen separately in the same exam room so they had to switch off, but this was probably a precaution to minimize potential contamination with other rooms. I’m guessing future appointments will be shorter since this was our very first time there. I’d like to add that the staff was very understanding and helpful when my 4 year old started to melt down and thus, a full blown meltdown was avoided =)<//review>

First of all, it’s fancy. New, clean, well lit, and feelin like VIP with the free drinks. About 24 years ago, my mom took me to a dentist with a high tech X-ray where you bite into this little rod it scans. No plates. I since then longed for a dentist as high tech as that place. This place is just that but up to date and more!!!! They got HEPA filters (great for my allergies) and humidifier that cleans the air naturally. Dentist office heaven. Dr. Tath is amazing. He’s my kind of provider because he explains, educates,  and walks you through procedures. He’s also patient. My daughter (in the pic looking cute with her eye protector they provided) hated the idea to go see a dentist and super anxious to go. The staff (also amazing and friendly) did a great job breaking her in. You would never guess in the picture she was nervous  eye protector. She now loves the idea of going to the dentist.

<text>Loved my first visit, the whole staff is super kind and they really take the extra step to make you feel comfortable. I’m usually nervous to go to the dentist but Dr. Pon Tath and his staff reassured me on all of my worries and let me know of all options I had in regards to my Dental Heath Plan. Definitely will keep going here and will be recommending to family and friends!< /text>< pics>

<Review>I am very leary of dentist.  So needless to say, I delayed to go do my much needed checkups and held off for as long as I  could. Well the road  met the rubber and I could not hold off any more so  I began searching around and afterreading various reviews decided to go with mossdale dental.  I  am proud to say that my faith in dentists have been restored the staff and Dr Taft at mossdale dental  are phenomenal beings.  From the first phone call all my questions were answered in a professional yet friendly manner, the office is super clean and  Everyone is courteous. I will highly recommend this dental office and you can thank me later for writing my review. I have a course of treatments to do but so far those that I have done has been pain free, if you're on the fence deciding where to go, please give Mossdale Dental a try.<//Review>< Resp>

<Review>This is Absolutely without a doubt the Best Dentist I have found in Lathrop.  The office is Super clean and Very Aware of COVID-19 practices. The dentist showed me around the whole office and what each room is. His staff are Extremely Friendly and want you to have the Best Dental experience. You can even watch Disney+ while they work on you or qny channels they can get.</Review></record>

During this “COVID” time I am nervous and scared to go anywhere. This time I had no choice, I haven’t slept well in 3 days due to constant pain from my wisdom tooth. I needed to be seen. I heard about Mossdale Dental through friends and figured I’ll give them a try. First off they stagger your appointment quite well. So you’re the only one in the waiting room. While in the waiting room there are 3 air filtration/purification/sanitizing devices on at all times. Dr. Tath came out to great me and gave me a tour of the facility. When you’re in the room there is another purifier running! Well turns out I needed my wisdom tooth extracted. Dr. Tath and team is very calming, welcoming, knowledgeable, courteous. There was no pain or discomfort during the whole procedure! The experience was fantastic and will definitely recommend Mossdale Dental to my family and friends.<//review>

< Review>
Today was my first visit but won’t be my last. I’m so happy I found Mossdale Dental. Dr Tath and all of his staff were extremely friendly. They explained everything they would be doing before it was done. This calmed my nervousness & anxiety very much. They answered all my questions & made me feel very comfortable.

The facility is very clean & comfortable. I was given a tour of the facility and I appreciated that SO much. They are going above & beyond to keep the staff as well as patients safe during this covid time. They have a great system of spacing patients as to not cross with anyone else. This was great.

I will be recommending this office to all of my friends & family. I will also be bringing my young daughter in next.

If you live in the Lathrop area you definitely need to come to this dentist. They are wonderful.<//Review>

<name>Denny</name><Text>My experience at Mossdale Dental exceeded my expectations. As a new patient, Dr. Tath and his staff were both welcoming and friendly. The staff takes all necessary precautions to ensure my safety during this pandemic. There is a check-in process in which my temperature was taken and a mask was provided.

I’ve been to multiple dentists prior to Mossdale Dental. Dr. Tath has been the only dentist who takes his time to thoroughly explain each of my procedures and why it was needed. He made his explanations easy for me to understand which allowed me to feel more comfortable as a patient. I highly recommend seeking Dr. Tath and Mossdale Dental for any dental related needs.</Text>< resp>

If I could give more than 5 stars, I definitely would. It gives me great relief that I’ve finally found a dentist that is more than qualified in their field (with over 15 years of experience). Dr. Tath and his staff exceeded my expectations — from their preventive safety measures against COVID to their state-of-the-art equipment and machineries. Dr. Tath thoroughly explained what he was doing, which made me feel very comfortable and at ease knowing what was going on at all times. The professionalism and friendliness I experienced just on my first visit assured me that I was in good hands with Dr. Tath and his staff. Highly recommend!</Text>

Dr. Tath and his team are amazing! I have been there about 3x time now and their routine has been consistent! Dr. Tath is very informative and you can always see him guiding and teaching his staff. His staff are kind and always explained everything to my daughter who is normally very nervous and asked a lot of questions. We had an emergency issue and Dr. Tath and his team worked quickly to fit my daughter in the same day as well. Everyone is so kind and welcoming.<//review>

I came in for a routine checkup and cleaning. With the whole Covid thing, it's been well over 6 months since my last dentist visit. Needless to say, my teeth needed some TLC. The office was everything I'd expect from a brand new office - clean, updated, etc. The staff was friendly and it was very apparent that they are following the Covid guidelines which made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. Dr. Tath was friendly and didn't shame me for having neglected my teeth for some time :-). Conversation seemed to flow naturally with him rather than seem like a forced one. Will definitely be taking my husband here for his upcoming checkup.</review>

< Review>
I was having a terrible toothache and gum swelling for 3 days and my dentist’s office was closed for the holiday until that Monday.

I looked online for an open dental office and called 3; 2 were prompters, and 1, a real person on the other line. This was Mossdale Dental.

James, the front desk person, took my call and in a few minutes, put me down for an appointment after lunch. A few minutes after, James called to let me know they would be able to see me in the morning. What a great relief!
James exerted all effort to get me in to the clinic as fast as he could, inspite of him being very busy.
He was sincerely helpful, very efficient, kind, and pleasant. He’s the  perfect person in the front desk.
Amanda, the dental assistant was so nice, skilled, pleasant, gentle and kind. She did imaging of my mouth using a high-tech machine.
Dr. Tath, the equally sincerely helpful, very professional, kind dentist, explained my dental issues, gave me prescription for antibiotics, and how he would eventually fix the problem.
What a relief! I’m soo grateful!!
They also have a program which is cost effective for people who have no insurance.
I was blessed to have been seen by this clinic. I will follow up with them in 2 weeks.<//Review>

<Text>Best Dental place in Lathrop/Manteca area, Interior office of the building very high class and has that modern welcoming of new patients/old patients. You get to watch Disney + and enjoy some sparking water while you wait to go in, they even let me watch it while I was waiting for the doctor in the operating room which I thought was pretty cool. Staff there is super friendly and professional, Helps me overcome my dental phobias. Dr Tath is very good at what he does, made my first wisdom tooth removal  less scary than I thought it would be like. They take great precautionary measures for Covid and makes me feel more safe during my visits. Found my new go to Dental office.< /Text><user_id>107960184784874118474< /user_id>< Pictures>

I called Mossdale Dental about excruciating pain in my tooth. I was very skeptical about trying out a new dentist due to the pandemic as well as being 20 weeks pregnant. His staff encouraged me to be seen and I’m glad that I did! I appreciate all of the precautions that they are taking to ensure the safety of their patients during the pandemic but also the extreme measures they take when caring for a pregnant patient. I ended up needing an extraction and root canal. I experienced quite a bit of anxiety just before the procedure started but I’m so thankful for the kindness and patience of Dr. Tath and his staff. They were extremely compassionate and ensured me that things would be okay- followed by personal check ins to make sure that I was recovering properly. Thank you all!<//review>

<text>I had such a wonderful experience with Mossdale Dental. The office was very neat and clean. Both Dr. Tath and the staff were so friendly and professional throughout the entire visit. They took preventative safety measures to ensure patients that they are taking precautions during this pandemic. I came here to get my wisdom teeth removed and was a bit nervous about the entire process. But, Dr. Tath eased my worries by thoroughly explaining how the procedure will go and how to proceed with the aftercare. It was not as bad as I had anticipated it to be. Definitely recommend coming here.</text>< user>

I have not seen a dentist over 5 years due to my fear and embarrassment of my teeth. I'm the type of person who would avoid seeing one unless I was in great pain but that changed thanks to Mossdale Dental. After my experience at Mossdale, I felt the need to write a review because he changed my perspective on Dentists. I came in for a check up and cleaning. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted nicely by the team. I was able to get a tour and was amazed how neatly and clean the set up was. I explained to Dr.Tath how nervous I was and he completely understood. He was very patient with me. He walked me through each procedure and made sure I was comfortable. What amazed me most was being able to see what he was doing to my teeth on the screen. I was able to see which teeth had cavities which made me trust him more as a dentist. The previous dentists I've had pressured me into getting work done and didn't thoroughly explain why I needed those procedures. Dr. Tath is truly honest with his work. I did not feel pressured to get work done and loved how I did not need the laughing gas. I could honestly say I am not as nervous as I used to be and would definitely recommend him to friends and family. Thank you Mossdale Dental for making me feel like I could trust you guys and being so kind. Dr.Tath has an amazing team and is very knowledgeable. Thank you for educating me through the procedure. I enjoyed learning about dental care and had a great experience. Definitely recommend!< /text>

My 5 years old needed an extraction of one of his molars due to a cavity. He barely felt pain, not a single tear. All the staff took the time to explain all the procedure in detail. I was able to stay with my son the entire time. Dr. Tath is very professional and the extraction was a success.
Lariza, Angelina, and James are always willing to help you and answer all your questions. They all were very kind to my son. Además hablan ESPAÑOL 😉!!!<//Text>

<review>I would have to say the best Dental Office I’ve been to. Exceeded my expectations and blew my mind. From the Complimentary water and drinks from the fridge to the Netflix and chill while you wait your turn. This place really gave that comfortable vibe. If you had any health and safety concerns,(Covid-19). Each room is equipped with a Medify Airfilter to filter and clean the air to the smallest microbe constantly. The Office was kept clean and organized. As for the staff everyone was very professional and friendly. My visit here was fast and the procedure for my cleaning was done before I know it. Over all I enjoyed my experience at this wonderful Dental Office. Great environment, Great service and Great Professionals. 10/10 that is why I’m rating this place a 5 star.</review>< Gmap_id>

Rescue Rooter was incredible professional and prompt. I had an emergency on a Sunday and my builder recommended I call them. They came within a few hours and diagnosed the situation and recommended a fix. It took a few weeks but the team were the most professional plumbers I have worked with. It was issues with my old pipes. They gave me a price quote in advance and stick to it. It took over a week to fix but they came every day, wore masks, kept me in the loop, and followed up. Thanks goes out to everyone, especially Al and Cristian for their professionalism and knowledge, transparency, honesty, follow up, and job well done.</Review>

I would say that they are very responsive, professional, and friendly. I called and they responded right away. Unfortunately, my house doesn’t have a washout. Thus, the service wasn’t done. But I really admire them because the staff that they have is professional and knowledgeable, they provided me a good understanding about the problem.<//text>

From my initial site evaluation with Marty, to the team led by Tony, the entire experience was exceptional. I immediately felt like I could work with Marty. He was professional, personable and trustworthy. Tony led the installation team. He was also a pleasure to work with and he took the time to keep me updated on job. The cement work looks very good. I will be sure to recommend your company to friends and family. Thanks for all of your help!</text>

<Review>Well frist this was my second time using Rescue Rooter I have used them about one year ago and payed around 160. A year later I called for same problem and they did Exactly same thing for a price of 321.00 why I have No idea and I was also told when I called it would be apoxmently 30min wait and it took them 2hrs to show and I ask the gentlemen why did they say 30min and it took you 2hrs he said because I was coming from Compton when Compton is right over the bridge..lol and because they dont like to tell the people that it will take more than 2hrs so that was a disappointing to hear we I was also told i would get a discount for senior or for  military,AARP's and when I asked the gentleman for my discount he said No you can't get it .☹ we with all this hopefully I won't be calling them agin .</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
We dad a clogged branch waste line between the kitchen sink and main stack in a townhouse/condo. They came as agreed. The technician was friendly, neat, competent, and got the job done. He agreed, after some prodding, to a discounted price within the latitude given him by the company.

The only issue I had was that the advertised cost was misleading. We were told by the dispatcher and online advertising that the normal business hour service charge would be $79 but the actual cost quoted was $340. The purported reason was that there was not a “clean out”. Surely some jobs are more difficult than others, but getting equipment out and snaking a line would not necessarily be over 4 times more costly due to the point entry. A clean out is typically relevant to accessing a main line which is usually downstream from a clogged line at a bathroom or kitchen fixture. Seems like an industry standard bait and switch.< /Review>

Doug the manager is the best employee and representation of a stellar company that stands 100% by their work and word.  These days it’s very hard to find any company or any person that is amazing the entire time and takes the worry and work on and values the customer.  This company and staff does and I will always recommend them and use them for our home.  Back in 2013, they completed work and we had an issue this week.  Doug stood behind his company and took care of the issue and even did a final camera test on our main line in the pouring rain to make sure everything was perfect and it is.  A perfect company!  Thanks again.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My husband and I bought our house about a year ago. The home has an apartment attached we rent out. Well, the first weekend our new tenant moved in there was a horrible sewer smell. It’s bad enough to have a problem in our own home but the stress magnifies when it’s with a tenant. We called ARS Rescue Rooter and they came out within a few hours of our call. Our main contact throughout the whole process was Ray. He was extremely thorough trying to rule out everything it could possibly be before recommending we get the camera to check out the pipes. Sure enough our pipes had backed up to our rental unit and required replacing old 1950s cast iron pipes beneath our house to the main sewer line.

They provided a quote and came back out with a crew the next day! The whole project was huge but they really worked so quickly and efficiently over the next week to resolve the problem.

Ray in particular made sure to check in throughout with updates and made himself available for any questions we had.

The whole crew just seemed like all around great guys you can trust. Plumbing issues are no fun and this one was super stressful, but their hard work really put us at ease. Very glad we called them and glad we now have them as a contact for any future plumbing work we need help with.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My tankless water heater was worked on Oscar Guzman and Peter. First let me say that they were very good at what they do. Very professional and came early than the arrive time that was scheduled, which was nice. They change out our old busted water heater to a new and improved energy efficient tankless water heater. Both of them had a great attitude and took pride in there job, getting it done correctly and followed all of the compliance policy. Especially with this heat (summer time 96 degree) and the fact that they were very respectful with the current situation (the pandemic), they kept all safety regulations up to par as they worked. My family and I are thankful for their outstanding work and quick response time. If you get a chance to read this guys(Oscar and Peter). Thank you for your hard work during these tough times. I truly appreciate it.<//Text>< Pics>

becareful...... I just got a new replacement water heater with ARS. They came fast and once they get the job and paid, they do not respond anymore. The technician gave me his business card and say all the beautiful promises. He does not reply to emails or voice mails the next day. I had to call the office and talk to the lady and chase him down. technician promised to send the cost breakdown to my insurance company and its time sensitive. he has not responded since last week. secondly, city inspector came today and said needed 2 additional corrections to be done. third, technician did not inform me a city inspector will be reaching out and coming. I got a surprise knock on my door and we were all confused for a moment. with all these said, i spend couple thousand dollars and expect a reasonable standard of service.< /Review>

The drainage problem we had was serious. Oscar, the lead plumber was considerate, helpful  and sensitive to our needs. He kept us informed every step of the way.. That was one of the most important aspects when selecting your company. We plan to use ARS for our plumbing maintenance.<//review>

When the serviceman showed up On time he already had on his mask 😷 and allowed me to explain and showed the problem and was friendly and professional and shared an immediate quote based on a price list not just some random number out the air! Reasonable prices for such expertise! And he cleaned up after himself as well! Will not hesitate to call again should the need arise!< /review>

Oscar from Rescue Rooter was amazing. On time, professional and very knowledgeable. Answered every question I had and verified his work even after the install.  Would of hoped the cost was a bit cheaper (the only reason to deduct a star) but working with Oscar made it worth it and why I would return to get more work done.< /review>

First off, my grandmother is ninety and in the early stages of Alzheimer's.  It was already a bit of an overwhelming day for both of us.  She requires a gentle hand.  Fred and Bryant were godsends to me today.   They were kind, warm, knowledgeable and above all, patient with my grandmother.   Turns out, the plumbing in her home was much more dire than I thought and the guys took care of it quickly and efficiently, and everything is like new again.

Fred and Bryant are excellent ambassadors of ARS.   And they're just incredible human beings.  They went above and beyond for my grandmother and I today.  Their compassion is something I will never forget.   And you have lifelong customers in my family.    Thank you so much for everything.

We had to install the automatic water shut off valve and detectors in our home and ARS was amazing from start to finish. Gabriel helped me understand how to use the system and was able to assist me with any questions I had. They’re also super reliable and honest and priced matched a few items for us as well. Johnny our technician was great! His work was very clean and precise and he made sure he put things back to where they were before he started his work. Ive never worked with a plumbing company that handles their customers like they do. Definitely a great team and I would definitely hire them in the future for any plumbing needs.</Text>

ARS Rescue Rooter rescued me!

After some quick Google research for 24 hour Plumber, I gave ARS a call and was able to schedule an on site appointment the same day, even on a Sunday!

A very nice, well informed, trained technician named Roberto helped resolve an issue with what turned out to be the seismic natural gas shut-off valve.

Roberto schooled me on some basic maintenance on my tankless water heater, performed a site survey for other recommended related maintenance, and all in a short time at a very reasonable cost.

Great work Roberto with ARS Rescue Rooter, you saved the day!</Text>

Fast response. Almost accurate on arrival time but let me know when they were able to get tech and when he’d arrive. Arrived on time. Friendly. Fast. Seemed knowledgeable. Wore surgical booties over shoes to protect floors.
However he dropped them in front yard on way out. All in all it was a very positive experience and I’d hire them again.</text>

It was a pleasure working with Maurice in particular on my four units. Had him come by to clear a couple drains and replace some components for optimal performance. He was quick to do it and offer the best solutions always with a smile.

The admin at ARS is A+ as well. Easy to work with, great communication and flexible scheduling. The accuracy of their 30 min arrival warning is awesome and crucial for someone like me who lives off site.

Appreciate the service< /text>

Initially I contacted them to cleanout my drain. Upon arrival they assessed my plumbing, grabbed their tools and initiated the cleaning. However, the technician left and two managers came and recommended replacing my access point and 4ft of plumbing. Following, they went over the cost and left. When I returned into my house I noticed they did not put my drain overflow back and called their customer service line. A representative informed me they will send the technician back. However, when the technician returned he did not put the pieces back instead he stated that he would call his manager and left. Long story short, the manager informed me after the technician left for the 2nd time that the age of the house is the reason why they can’t repair the fixture. However, I was never informed prior to the leaving that they recommended the pipes to be replaced because they were loose. They care to conduct a house visit because my bathroom tub is still clogged and in the same condition as before. I would not recommend the company at all and regret even calling them.< /review>

<review>Paid for my main line to be cleared and in addition had to pay to have my bathtub line cleared and not even two hours later my laundry line backed up. I called immediately to report the issue and was told someone would be out and two hours later someone called to inform if they came out I would have to be a 99$ charge. I declined and was informed I could receive a reservice between 8-9 am with no charge but I never received a call and when I called back I was informed that I wouldn’t be charged. So three hours later I’ve just received a call stating if they came out it would be an additional charge on top of the 275 I already spent. TOTAL RIP OFF

Thank you ARS for responding to my complaint and correcting my plumbing situation free of charge Ray was fantastic and I appreciate you guys for handling the matter with urgency and understanding</review>< Resp>

ARS Rescue Rooter are a very well run and professional organization. The technicians and supervisors were informative, efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The work was done properly and on time. I’ll definitely recommend them to friends and family.</review>

ARS sent Oscar out the next morning after I called them. He was prompt, clean, friendly and worked very hard to resolve my issue! Would definitely hire again next time I’m in need of plumbing!< /Text>

MATTHEW OUT DID HIMSELF
ARS saved us from a poor plumbing job done by DR construction out of Belflower. Matthew came in, assessed the situation, gave us options with no pressure and was able to start the job that same day. They cleaned up after themselves and also Patched up any walls they had to open.

My ex contractor even called the company acting as my husband to seek information and Matthew called me right away!

the dispatch team was on top of their game and very professional

I am so happy i hired this company and will use them again if need be

I even got a warranty for parts and service

Thank you so much<//Review>

<Text>ARS responded to my service request in less than 2 hrs on a Sunday. Their service is honest, cost effective, fast and thorough. I highly recommend them.

Matt did an excellent job of explaining my problem and the options for repair. He fixed my garbage disposal and gave me good tips on how to avoid a similar problem in the future.

I am temporarily confined to a wheelchair due to a recent accident and Matt could not have been kinder or more considerate. He definitely made my day brighter.

Thank you for an excellent customer experience!

Needed my washing machine line cleared out. Got tired of putting down towels to wash my towels. Went online and found ARS had an offer that was amongst the lowest I could find. Gave them a call and was pleasantly surprised by the very nice lady that told me they could be out within a couple hours. Sounded good to me. A short while later another call and was told that a technician could be at my home in a few minutes. I have never had such clear communication like this for any service industry.  The guy that replaced my kitchen sink wouldn't answer my calls for days. This was the exact opposite.
A nice young man named Johnny  showed up and explained everything he would do. He attempted to snake out the line, but there appeared to be an obstruction.  After giving it his best effort, he called his supervisor that had a camera that would show them the blockage. He would come from Paramount to Torrance and would be on his way shortly. This was being done for free. WHAT?
After some communication, it was decided to try a different machine that might work. Lo and behold,  Johnny was able to use this machine to clear the obstacle and successfully clear the line. He put a garden hose down the line for several minutes and confirmed that it was indeed clear. After he was almost finished,  another tech showed up to see if he could be of any help. WHAT?
I would just like to finally finish by saying that ARS is at the top of their game. Everyone associated with this company appears to just want to do the same thing. That is to make sure they have a satisfied customer. Well, I don't have to tell you that they will be the first number I call in the future and that all my friends and work mates will know what I experienced. Thanks ARS for being the best!!</Review>

Antonio and Joel from ARS Rescue Rooter were very professional and honest. Initially called to replace what I believed to be a leaking water heater but they found the actual problem, saving me from wasteful spending. Provided me with a diagnostic of my problem and options to solve it at no cost. Would highly recommend.<//Review>

I was very pleased with Jamie's professionalism.  He took time to do a thorough inspection of my plumbing.  He informed me of what the problem was and the next steps to take to solve it.   I must say 10x better than the other plumbing guys, I've had in the past.  Thumbs up to Jamie for a job well done!< /Review>

Robert and Miguel did an awesome job for my wife and I. Both men had a super attitude and went the extra mile to get our tough job done right. Though I don’t like having plumbing issues, I’d look forward to seeing you guys again. Thanks guys!</Review>

Rescue Rooter was a great choice for us today! They were able to send someone out to our house/office just a few hours after I called about our master bath shower drain being clogged. Our technician Jason arrived on time and didn’t even laugh when he showed me that it was just the strainer inside of the drain that was clogged and not the actual drain. We’ll be calling them again!< /Text>

I'm very happy with the service. Edwin was respectful of my home, and very knowledgable. You can tell he takes his work seriously, and he was able to explain a lot of technical things without overwhelming me. Everything's working smooth now, and I will definitely use this company again in the future.< /text>

<Text>I needed MAJOR work done! Luckily I literally saw Vianka in the Rescue Rooter Van and flagged her down. She was off work but friendly and agreed to have her guys come out the next day to check it out.
Al arrived with a team and they did an inspection and were friendly, respectful and knowledgeable.
The inspection with cameras began... the team: Tirso, Julian, Andy, Joel and Patrick were neat and cleaned up after work everyday. They were considerate of my house by covering dirt with a tarp and just overall really nice! I can’tThsnk then enough for getting this work done!<//Text>< Pics>

Had a clogged main line and Omar and Francisco came out to fix it. They were on time, polite, clean and HONEST. They unclogged the pipe and called their colleague Jose in to check where the problem was with his camera. Jose showed me the issue and explained it to me. Then provided me with a quote for potentially fixing the problem. However there was absolutely no pressure involved in making me feel like I needed to do it "right now" or only with them. I appreciated their professionalism and compassion. Would definitely call them and use them again. Happy customer :)</text>

Charles came out, I addressed him of the situation and he completely took care of the issue.  He was extremely well mannered and worked in a timely manner. He was very clean and made sure before he left that all my plumbing issues were taken care of.

He is an asset to the ARS Team.

I would call ARS/ Rescue Rooter again if I have any plumbing issues.

Thank you Charles, your the Best!!<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>It's really bleak when your sewer backs up on a Saturday morning especially when you find out that your 90 year old pipe to the city, in Hancock Park, needs to be replaced.  ARS is a professional company and believes in training their people, and it shows: everyone of the individuals responsible to replace our sewer were professional and courteous.  Matt, Ken (the big guy), Francisco, Andy, Marco (polo) and the entire ARS team were fabulous in that they kept us informed and followed through every detail.

It is refreshing to interact with such a professional group during such a tramatic event.  They aleviated a lot of anxiety in responding to a major household issue; by educating and providing video of their work every step of the way.   Delilah and David<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>ARS Rescue Rooter gave me an appointment the next day after I called the night before.  The plumber was print and very professional.  He was knowledgeable about the problem and fixed it well.  He explained what I needed to know about why the problem occurred.  After fixing it, he showed me what he had done and how he made it better.  😀 He gave me education on any future situations.  The price was fair as well.  I recommend this company to anyone.  Thank you 😊< /text>< pics>

<review>Can not say enough great things about the service I received from Roque. I had family visiting for the holidays and ended up with a bad clog in the bathroom forcing the toilet to back up into the shower it was awful and with a full house!!! He came to my rescue diagnosed the problem and had me up and running in no time. He was prompt, courteous, knowledgeable and could not have been more helpful.   Thank you so much Roque you did your company proud. I was very nervous to try a new plumbing company but after my experience with Roque I am so happy I took the chance on ARS.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Rescue rooter send a plumber out to my place within 1.5 hours of calling  without charging any after hours fees as this was a Saturday evening.  The plumber was extremely friendly, fixed the problem and left the space clean. I had a full blockage clog in my upstairs condo bathroom sink. I would definitely recommend Rescue Rooter and use them again in the future!</Text>

As a General Contractor for over 40 years I have the bar set pretty high. The gentleman who arrived at my home was on time and did his job in a professional and timely manner. As for the initial call to Rescue Rooter, It was way too complicated. The person answering the phone asked way too many questions and then repeated the questions again. All in all i am pleased and will use them again. I hope I'm in the computer now so I do not have to answer ALL those questions next time I call.< /review>

They came when they said they would. They were inexpensive and kept to their cost estimate. They cleared the mainline clog in 15 minutes when we had tried snaking it ourselves for days! Wish we would have called sooner.</review>

<Review>After losing a ring down the toilet, we located it 50’ down the waste pipe. Marty was undeterred and determined. We fashioned hooks around the camera, sent it back down and fished it out. We couldn’t believe it worked, but it did. Great experience with your service and could not say enough good things about Marty Suart. Thank You!</Review>< user_name>

I had Melvin Hernandez come out today to unclog washing machine drain and kitchen sink drain. I have to say he was the best plumber I've ever had work on my house! I've lived here for 35 years so over the years I have had many plumbers but not like him ! He was very kind, not pushy like so many are and fixed my problem asap. I will definitely call again when a plumbing problem happens !< /Review>

<review>Robert D.  Was on time, courteous, professional, helpful with matters about the plumbing in general ( new house build with a contractor who doesn't return calls). He was conscientious about laying down floor coverings to protect the area, used shoe covers, cleaned the area and toilet after fixing the issue. He patiently showed us the issues and explained them as we asked question after question.
Addendum: the toilet has been rocking, not replaced well.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

He was respectful, pleasant, explained the issues, and made me feel well taken care of.  I'd have no

I recently had to address some gurgling pipes in an older Torrance home, and chose to call ARS Rescue Rooter LA Basin, located in Paramount.  In less than two hours, Edwin arrived, and after snaking the line out to the street proved not to be the issue, he and his Field Rep, Jose', ran a video scope  through the line and correctly diagnosed the issue.

Edwin was wonderful -- he was very knowledgeable, worked safely and with our safety in mind.  Edwin worked efficiently and cleanly; he was polite and very patient in explaining what exactly was being done. I hope not to have plumbing issues any time soon, but if I do, I will call ARS and ask for Edwin :)</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I got quick service and the person on the phone was pleasant and very accurate about when to expect our technician. Antonio was prompt, polite and knowledgeable. He asked us about possible coupons or specials. We booked online and yes there were specials. He suggested a hydro wash out and since it had been more than 10 years since our last rooter service we went ahead with the hydro wash out after the rooter was done. We got a discount and a 1 year warranty. So glad Antonio could help us especially on a Sunday.</Text>

Al & Marcelino did a great job servicing my drain issue. I had what I thought was a simple backed up kitchen drain. After trying to plunge and snake myself I realized this was not a simple back up. I initially gave Roto Rooter a call and suffered sticker shock with the techs estimate as well as lack of concern or thorough inspection for my drain problem. My second call was to Rescue Rooter. Marcelino shows up for the consult did a thorough inspection of my kitchen sink and clean out before giving me a very fare estimate. After initial drain snaking it was clear my problem required a bit more work. Al provided a great quote for the additional work. The both of them provided a stress free environment and in the end delivered a great service. They were both friendly and professional from start to end. I was extremely pleased with the service and value. Thank you fellas.< /Text>

Rescue Rooter is amazing. We had a huge flood after hard rains. First Moe the plumber came out and they said they couldn’t get to us for two weeks. Moe the Plumber further stated if it rains we will have to have more flooding, they can’t work in the rain and could do nothing to prevent any more flooding.
The people from Rescue Rooter came out and said they would start repairs right away. They worked in the rain and prevented more flooding. They are working every day including weekends. They will be finished way before Moe the plumber could even start.
I am so grateful to them especially Juan, Tony, Matthew, Israel, Chepe, Marco and Jesse. Keep up the great work Rescue Rooter. And thanks again for saving our homes.<//Review>

Called Rescue Rooter late Sunday night about a major clog in my kitchen and appointment was set for early Monday. Robert came exactly at 8:30 and asked for my input to problem; ran the water to the 3 sink piping"s and told me exactly how he was going to attack it and the associated price.  After agreement, he proceeded to the task like a surgeon, he prepared the area and with precision he took the pipes apart to which they were all clogged with black cake. He cleaned all, cut the wall piping due to corrosion, cleaned via snaking this pipe and put on adapter.  He proceeded to reassemble piping and replaced bad pipes with new ones. Once all piping in place, ran water, made one more minor adjustment and proceeded to snake the clean out drain from outside. After all was complete, he cleaned up all and updated paper work with additional cost due to replacement parts.  He asked if I was happy with job and I said "YES!". and left to his next assignment.  All is well again with my kitchen pipes!  I highly recommend this company. Thank you Robert and Rescue Rooter.</review>

Melvin and Alex did an excellent job on our house. We have been here since 1962. Major plumbing repairs were needed and they serviced them in a timely manner with hardly any inconvenience of not having accecc to water. I am proud to say they got the job done and I would highly recommend them to anyone.< /Review>

What was really bad timing for plumbing repairs with Thanksgiving approaching and guest arriving this weekend, was minimized by Melvin's efforts. We really appreciated his attention to our angst over the plumbing damage.< /text>< user_name>

A couple of months ago, I had a problem that had to be fixed immediately. ARS / Rescue Rooter LA Basin was able to help me out within an hour or so of my call. The technician, Yony, was very professional and was able to get to the root cause of my problem, and fix it, very quickly. The owner of the franchise also came out to my home that evening and gave me a complimentary camera scan of my drain pipe to confirm that the blockage had been removed. Thank you ARS/ Rescue Rooter LA Basin! I will call again if I need assistance!<//review>

We had a mainline back-up, we looked on line and called Rescue Rooter.  We have never used them before, but decided to take a chance.  Ray came out and was very professional, thorough, polite and friendly.  Two other representatives came out as well, both were equally professional and friendly.

Everything was explained to us before the work was started, and all was confirmed by the quality assurance department.

Ray did a great job.  Everything was done by the book, and we're very happy with the results.

We would use Rescue Rooter again.  We would ask for Ray.  We would recommend Rescue Rooter.<//text>

Excellent work.  The camera they used showing me the rust inside the 50-year-old cast iron pipes was extremely helpful in making my decision to replace them.  They showed me the rust buildup after they removed the pipe and it was actually worse than I thought.  Not the cheapest guys in town ... but you get what you pay for.</text>

RESCUE ROOTER REVIEW Excellent.

Superior service!  Omar, Israel Jose and the crew were outstanding.
They replaced the entire drain system  amazingly quickly. They  let us know  when to expect them and arrived on time. They told us when we had to stop using water and arranged the work in stages so the no-water period would be short;   Before they started they explained what they were going to do, what it would cost, and offered a senior discount; before we signed the contract the office manager called to be sure we understood everything
We will use them for all future plumbing needs.<//Review>

The service was professionally handled from beginning to end. The Technician was clean, prompt and polite in his work. I was very happy with the service though the cost was certainly more than I had expected for what I considered a very minor service rendered.  For that reason alone I can only give 3 stars.  One should never have to pay extra for courtesy .<//Text>

<Text>Anthony was at our door within 1 hour of calling on Easter Sunday morning 4/5/15. He quickly assessed the problem, provided a detailed quote and answered several questions about potential future issues that might come up after the job began, including potential costs of additional services, and which ones might be needed before he started the first part of the process. He was helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, and he worked efficiently, taking care of our significant plumbing problem within about 2 hours. We were very lucky to have discovered the problem when we did, and once we looked at our options, we luckily decided to call Rescue Rooter to help us out, and got even luckier with Anthony being our plumber.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Awful! Total scam artists. $79 and they did nothing. Told me to pour bleach down the toilet. I had it hydro-jetted for $200. They arrived and told me it would be a minimum of $300 to remove a toilet and snake.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I called this company because of an ad that read $79.00 plumbing service with $50.00 rebate if no warranty is taken.  When the guy got here he told my husband after the fact that the charge was $189.00!  (it took him less than 2 minutes to unclog the toilet). I told him NO, I was told the charge would be $79.00 and the guy on the phone even asked if we were seniors or had auto club and something else.  I told him we were seniors and also had auto club.  He told me we could also use one of the 10% discounts for this service.  The person who did the work, Maurice was nice but said NO we could not have the discount.  I paid him $79.00 and he did not argue.  He asked for a copy of the ad which I printed up for him and he changed the invoice fee to $79.00  However,  I will NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!< /Review>< user_name>

<text>Super Fast & Fantastic Plumbing Job!

I called Rescue Rooter this morning because I had a faucet leak in my bathroom sink. They were out immediately and their service technician Cliserio Avalos did a wonderful job. It was a complicated job because my sink is a pedestal sink. He was very careful and went out of his way to not move the pedestal and worked around it.  I was very appreciative that he spent the extra time with the difficult job. He also made sure the job was done correctly before leaving. He was very courteous, professional and explained the entire process every step of the way. The best part is that he did not leave any mess and cleaned up everything. I highly recommend Rescue Rooter for your plumbing needs. 5 Star Service!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2ca8cc9220253:0xd5d16ad102b57ecc< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Rescue Rooter aims to please--all about service and assisting the customer ASAP!  Anthony Hilton, our plumber, was amazingly professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.  He drove many miles from Gardena to our home in Santa Monica, three times!  He installed a new water heater we purchased ourselves (to save funds) and did it quickly and efficiently. If I ever have another plumbing problem, I would definitely call Rescue Rooter and ask for Anthony!<//Review>

Most disappointing and unprofessional service.  I was first quoted a time between 7-9.  Next I spoke to Kelly she quoted a time of 12-2. Next Jackie says tomorrow.  I called them.  I wasted a full day for no good reason.

<Review>The technician showed up within the time frame promised by the dispatcher (1 hour).  The initial on-the-spot estimate to unclog a drain was very high.  The technician must have been upselling their "enhanced" services to maximize company income) but after negotiating -- and having a discount coupon handy -- I was satisfied with the price and authorized the technician to start the job.  He did the job relatively fast and efficiently, and cleaned up the work area afterwards.  My 5-star rating is for the end result of the technician's work, and price ($59 with their promotion coupon).<//Review><time>1506870351654<//time><UserId.>115474602832948461190<//UserId.>< username>

<review>Initial inspection by plumber was great but it has already been a week and I still don’t have the estimate that I had requested.   Called the company and was extremely hard to get in contact with someone who even knew what I was talking about.  Makes me think was a estimate even ever made? Unprofessional and disappointing.</review>< time>

<Text>Had a major sewer back up on Saturday evening.  Hadn't used Rescue Rooter before but Rescue Rooter was the only of several plumbers we called who could come out that night.  I'm so glad that we found them. Fredy was very thoughtful, thorough, professional and explained everything.  In the future, Rescue Rooter will be my first call for our plumbing needs.

Update - I used Rescue Rooter for an emergency weekend call.  All seemed to go very well and I was happy with the service. I even refered them to a friend who had a good experience. Unfortunately several months after the sewer back up, a termite inspection uncovered a slow drip under our house.  Our regular plumber came out and discovered the seal under the toilet wasn't properly placed by the Rescue Rooter plumber leading to a slow drip. Between the original back up and drip, we ended up with a mold problem in the bathroom floor and wall. Fortunately it was found before the mold was too extensive. I tried calling the company twice.  As someone who owned a small business for years, I thought they would want to know and might at least apologize.  Never got a call back.</Text></record>

< review>
Yes the guys that showed up were great and did an overall good job. Just not sure about the business model of Rescue Rooter. How can an 8 - 9am appointment slide into an almost 12 noon appointment. Got tired of so many times we are doing our best only to delay again and again. Felt as if they wanted to give me hope so I don't just get someone else. Almost felt like psychological warfare, I was so tired of it all, that when they finally diagnosed the issue and gave me a price quote, I would just pay whatever to just get the whole thing over with! I am glad I did not, got the issue fixed by a local plumber and saved $1,500. Not sure I would used them again</review>

< Review>
so we had called out, for non emergency service on a Tuesday, to replace a faucet being that work was going to be done in a high rise building, we needed an insurance proof, and schedule it. So they send out a plumber without ins. cert and had to call corporate for it.......they told me it takes 24 - 48 hours for insurance proof, so we patiently wait for rescheduling,  which it's was a week later and we still didn't hear from them! that was very poor communication on their behalf,
so we call another company who took care of replacing kitchen faucet and water flow in less than 24 hours from our call. IWILL NEVER CALL OR USE ARS RESCUE ROOTER< /Review>

Machen was great. He completed and fixed my sink in less than an hour. The price was a little steep but to no fault of of the plumber. He was polite direct and price was exactly as he quoted. Would use again in an emergency</Review>

I call this company at 6:30am and they had a technician out at my house within 2 hours. Ray came out to help me with my backed up sewer line and realized that my HOA covers this type of problem. He did not charge me for the service call and I was completely surprised how honest and helpful he was. If I ever have any other plumbing issues I wouldn't hesitate to call these guys.</text>

Rescue rooter did complete the job. They were very professional in  diagnosing the problem and took their time to properly resolve the drain blockage. The only drawback was that they showed up approximately 3 hours late and then had to request additional help to resolve the problem. Also they did honor their special pricing and discount.< /review>

Had a main line stoppage. I called Rescue Rooter. Robert came to the house and had the problem quickly repaired. I thought that maybe I had tree roots or some other problem but after Robert snaked the main line from the toilet out to the street he told me that there wasn't a tree root problem or anything else that was major to be concerned about. I had thoughts of having to dig up my front yard as my neighbor did a couple of years ago. Long story short, the service was great and at a very fair price.
I will definitely call Rescue Rooter again.

Excellent service from start to finish. The first plumber I called about the water backing up into our basement said they could "fit me in" two days later!  Uh, no. I then called Rescue Rooter and within an hour "Ro" (Romalice)  was en route to our address. He took the time to fully explain the issue and gave suggestions on ways to avoid future plumbing issues. Best of all, they honored the internet price for the service we received.  Very satisfied. Would recommend.

David arrived to assess the problem. he  snaked the drain first, with little results, suggested we have him use high pressured water to unclog. it unclogged but he felt something else was wrong, so he can someone to use a camera to find the problem, one of the pipes needed to be replaced. So we started the process of fixing the problem, David is truly a hard worker dedicated to his job. David is a very polite, easy to talk to, very respectful, he was here from friday night till 11:30pm, came back the next day to finish the job, didn't leave till about 10;30pm . we were amazed he did the job quickly, dug the hole with just a shovel, by himself, it was HOT outside, taking care not to leave a mess in our driveway, that was considerate, and put back the asphalt in the driveway,we had other contract workers leave a horrible mess for us to clean up. so I would  recommend David to anyone who needed work done for Rescue Rooter.</review><gmapID>0x80c2ca8cc9220253:0xd5d16ad102b57ecc</gmapID><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

The plumber came out & inspected, was suppose to come back,but didn't.
They pushed back my appointment 3 time & still didn't show up. Bottom line, they suck.< /text>

My kitchen sink had been clogged for about 3 months, after trying several unsuccessful methods to clear the clogg I finally decided to get professional help and I called Rescue Rooter. Much to you surprise, they were able to schedule a service call within the hour. The office staff were very courteous and efficient and they followed through with keeping me posted with calls regarding the arrival time of the technician. The technician was Clarence Johnson and he arrived on time, assessed the problem and explained my possible options in detail and gave me the estimated cost which I agreed with and then he proceeded to work on fixing it. Clarence fixed the clogged sink quickly and I am completely satisfied with the results. Clarence provided me with a contact number to call if any future problems arise within the warranty period. I would definitely use this service again if needed and would recommend Rescue Rooter to my friends and relatives.</review>

Stay far away from this business it designed  and set up to rob you for your money. This is how it begins, first they have what is called a PRS (a sales person) that comes out to the call or he may wait around the corner until the technician calls him.The technician will purposely not clear the drain and act as if he is trying to clear the drain, 99% of the jobs here are sold off of lies that the PRS’s tell you. They’ll tell you, you have major root damage in your clay or cast iron pipes and they want to repair it to get more money (charging for an extreme service that is not necessary for the job). The PRS salesman have a required quota every month of $100,00 (they average about $175,000)/ the technicians that do the work have a quota of $30,00 a month (they average about $75,000). The company overhead (mark up price) is triple the price of any other company, they will tell you, You need a bid calculator and they will say, “Let me talk to my boss”. They will hike up the price faster than you can blink. Any PRS sent to your house is to rob you!! Beware and watch out for technicians that call for additional help. If any of you customers out there FELT as if they been done wrong by RESCUE ROOTER, Call the CORPORATE number on the INVOICE, ASK to get your MONEY back or take them to court.< /text>

ZERO star if possible. This is worst company I had ever dealed with. My kitchen sink pipe clogged up 2 weeks ago in a weekday. Called this stupid company found on Google (don't trust Google review, I believed this company paid for the first search) and they said they will be there by 7-8am, 8am passed nobody came and called back and saying still on the way. They came 8:20am, LATE! Then they have a small van like nv200 size and I was skeptical what kinda tools inside. I requested a hydrojet and camera
for my kitchen pipe, I assumed the hydrojet will be like at least 100 ft long with a big machine so powerful and long enough to main pipe. And it's supposed should have camera go inside there to see what's inside then clean up the pipe. Then they said they only have hydrojet machine and no camera, they only have 2 camera for the whole company. How do you run a business without everything needed to serve customer? OK because my kitchen clogged I couldn't wait until camera here because it will take another half day for them to get here. So they pull out the machine. A small tiny 2000psi machine, and approx 75 ft long jetter snake. I even have an 100ft at my house, can't believe they charged me 350 for the hydrojet. I should find some local asian company I believe they charge much less and have a more powerful machine. Remember this 350 you only get ONE hole, another hole 250 additional, sound like u get fked by using your bed your place and you prepare condom and u get charged 2nd time.

OK forget about the clogged and they kinda like cleared it, it drain fine. And said camera will be there on the same day afternoon by 2pm. 2pm passed and I called and they cant make it today. I was so mad and have to pretend a nice guy. Then reschedule to Saturday 8-10am. On Saturday, passed 10am I called they said need to postpone to 12-2pm. By 2pm they called me again they can't make it for that day. They wasted me 2 whole days. I rescheduled for another Saturday and promise me 8-10am I will be the first priority for the camera. First priority MY @SS~~~~~~, they told me again they will come 10am -12pm after I called at 10am. guess what, this time better, they came at 12:20pm. They LATED again!!!!! They bring a camera and turn it on. The camera doesn't read distance. Hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha, how the heck you say you guys are professional and you guys don't have a sewerage camera doesn't read distance? This is so unprofessional! I would never come back or recommend to anybody.<//Text>

<review>I am always skeptical when it comes to plumbers and quotes, etc.  But Rescue Rooters explained the special which was $88 but also in case we did not have the correct "clean out" drain they did say it would be more.  Fredy Vergara the technician came out and he was AWESOME.  Polite, professional, clean, and very knowledgeable about the pipes, etc.  I am clueless when it comes to this stuff.  Fredy explained how the pipes below were connected but we did not have the clean out pipe to get the special.  (I was actually told that by one of the other owners in our complex).  Fredy gave us the estimate $171 and the snake took less than 20 minutes.  He cleaned up the shower after and left no traces of the snaking.  Fredy was completely at ease with our barking dogs!  I highly recommend the company and Fredy V the technician!</review><username>karen goldberg<//username></record>

This company is more about making a sale not about taking care of the plumbing problem that you called them for. Also seniors beware.< /review>

<review>Horrible Horrible experience
The worst plumbing company in the Los Angeles area please please stay away they will quote you high and when the job is done will have a "higher" quote with "warranty"
Rescue rooter is a scam and their "warranty" is just another scam< /review>< Pictures>

Typical bait and switch, they quoted me one price and then wanted double when they showed up.  They didn't want to honor the discount they had offered on the phone and were 4 hours late.  They had an appointment between 8:30 and 9:30 and showed up past 2:00.<//text>
