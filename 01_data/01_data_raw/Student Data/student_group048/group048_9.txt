< review>
Always prompt and on time. They give us great quality prints. We are extremely happy with Alpha :) We were using FastSign but when I started here I reached out to get a quote from Alpha and never looked back. Love that they are a local family owned business and not a franchise they are extremely friendly and always a pleasure to work with. We've had stickers, flyers, Indoor and outdoor signage, Lots of decals and misc items. Our truck was also fully wrapped by them. Love Alpha!</review>

I had the best experience working with AlphaGraphics. I called first and the customer service was great so I decided to take a visit that day. I got a quote and immediately placed my order. A few days later my order was complete and my labels looked AMAZING and brought my product to life! I get asked all the time who printed my labels and I’m sure to tell them and send them to AlphaGraphics!< /review>

Alexis has been fantastic to work with from the beginning. Great communication.  Quick quote turnaround and great input on options.  Flexible and easy to work with She has made us feel like our business matters.  And Amy has patiently worked with us in making the designs just right for us.  She really helped make our brand come alive.  And finally, the finished products are perfect.  Quality print and vibrant color.< /text>

Our experiences with Alpha Graphics, Rancho Cucamonga have always been Great!  Their attention to detail, turn around time, quality and professionalism is why we feel they are the best in the industry.  They feel more like a Partner than a Vendor. They have recommended multiple products that have helped us grow and succeed. We highly recommend all of their products.< /text>

Everyone I spoke with was very professional and seemed generally interested in my needs. We talked about what it was I needed, came to an agreement, and I was told I would have a proof by the end of that day. True to their word I did receive it before the end of the day. After review,⁸ gave them the okay to do the work and again true to their word work was done and ready as promised. I will look to them in the future to have more work done. Thank you to AlphaGraphics for their professionalism an excellent work.

Our company needed a project done in a hurry and someone had referred us to Alpha Graphics. We were so happy and pleased with their work. AlphaGraphics was awesome. Great pricing, great customer service, and quick turn around time. Not to mention, they also delivered to us! We couldn't be more happier and will definitely use them again in the future.< /Review>

The Graphics were completed and approved on Good Friday, 2017 and the Sign was installed before 4pm that same day.  Needless to say we as a Church Family are ecstatic.  What a way to begin the Easter Holiday... We are most greatful to them and their Staff and would recommend them to anyone.  The price was also most impressive for the kind of service we were provided...</Review><username>Sonja Dawkins< /username><user_id>107740339521326426840<//user_id></record>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Working in the Real Estate industry and having my small business on the side, I can tell you that Alphagraphics has beat every vendor I've come across. I've worked with Tim, Matt and David on a daily if not, weekly basis and never disappointed. Granted, if there's a hick up on any material, David 99.9% of the time has already caught it and has it taken care of before I even laid my eyes on the mock ups. I've trusted this company by managing our 5 offices, Realtors, family members and now my own clients. Thanks guys! Took me a while to finally write a review, but I made it! lol</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

We went to the restaurant tonight and ordered some take out. When we got home we noticed a significant difference between what we were charged and the menu price from the handout they have there. When we called were told that they had risen prices but still were using old menus because their new menus with updated pricing they ordered in November hadn't arrived. That would be perfectly understandable if they simply informed us of the difference however they didn't. When we asked why they didn't inform us about the updated pricing the woman on the phone just stayed silent. Who knows how many others they have been overcharging without informing.< /text>

<text>Order a dragon roll, and 2 plates was told to pickup in 45 minutes got there in 45 minutes and stood there for 1 hr before they finally got the order to me. Bad service. Right before I left there was an argument between the cook and some one else in the  Back. O don't recommend.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Customer service was horrible. Took more than 15 mins to take our order and even longer to get our drinks. The restaurant was not busy but somehow the waitress came back and forgot she took our order and tried to retake it. My husbands baked lobster roll was horrible and fell apart as he ate it. The other food we order was tasty but one of our appetizers came after our entree.  Not a great experience and will not be returning.</text>

My review is long overdue.   The customer service is second to none - EXCELLENT!!!  I have purchased several times here.  The owners go far and above to ensure you are happy and satisfied with your meals.  The personal service is OUTSTANDING!!!  The establishment is always clean, well kept,  and never crowded. Every meal has been promptly served within a very reasonable time frame. The meals have always been exactly what I've ordered and have never had to send back.  I recommend the Korean ribs and 12 piece deluxe sashimi (always all salmon).  Some of the traditional rolls (rainbow) may not be as flamboyant as in other establishments but they are reasonably priced.  On that note the prices are reasonable.  I recommend anyone try this place.< /Text>

<Text>4 stars because the waitress was nice. The food however is different story. The Titanic roll was eh... Unlike Other places. The big disappointment is the teryaki short ribs, hard to chew almost like gum.

The food was really good. My only complaint was the banner outside said all rolls were buy one get one half off. That is not the case. They have a small menu that has that deal. Even when you point it out they will not honor it.<//Review>

< review>
I worked at Benihana making sushi. My favorites were the Salmon Skin and Spicy Tuna rolls. The new Shogun is terrible. The. Salmon Skin roll was like eating over cooked bacon bits. The breaded and fried rolls were also over cooked. The only good food items were the California Rolls and the Sapporo beer.</review>

The staff is very polite! Very accommodating. Very nice to kids. They really communicate and establish good relationships with their customers. If you are a returning customer they will greet you like they haven't seen you in forever!

They keep the restaurant very clean. There's classy music too so the environment inside is not nauseating.

Keep in mind that since this is a Japanese restaurant expect it to be a little costly. But the food is great! The food's presentation is great! They put a lot in your plate to the point that you can't finish the whole thing so you really get what you paid for.

They have a lot of items in their menu...some of the items' names are even humorous!

They serve salad with sweet salad dressing and it's good. A salad hater might like it. (Like me) I usually order the Pork Katsu and it's delicious! It's not bland at all. The breading is tasty and crispy and they put lots of pieces of it in your plate. Try everything with sauce. The sauce really makes a difference in your food.

P.S.
The tempura ice cream is the best! =) Just ask them about the ice cream once you're ready for dessert! (I think they do this because they deep-fry the ice cream. I think they wanna make sure the ice cream won't melt before they serve it to you)</Text>

The food was absolutely delicious, to be honest. I ordered the Teriyaki Tofu in a Bento box and the avo/cucmber rolls. However, the customer service was so horrible that I lost my appetite and called for my check. I used to go there all the time when I was younger with my Japanese grandma. Of course, I never had an issue while with her (unfortunately, I have no Asian facial features). I definitely will not be returning.< /Review>

<Review>FIRST and LAST time I will go there. I went in and placed an order to go..they bring me the order once it's ready and I asked the server for hot sauce...he looks over to the owner and tells him that I want hot sauce (like if he was asking for permission to give me some)..then once in the car I check my order and I am missing the California roll I had ordered...so I walk in and they give them to me(no soy sauce) I check the bag in my car and one packet of soy sauce was included for two orders(REALLY) so I go in again and ask for some the owner hands me ONE packet...being frustrated I ask to buy some....he SELLS me 5 soy sauce packets for $1 ...OMG .....my order included pot stickers but no sauce again.....It was too much... so I just left but will NEVER return... so if you go there make sure you take extra money to buy Soy sauce if you want any....food is not too bad but service is HORRIBLE...<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Friendly service with a great selection of delicious and creative tacos. Also, it has a whimsical pop up boutique inside with the cutest little trinkets and build-your-own memory lockets. If you aren't local it's worth the trip!< /review>

<Review>Tacos were delicious. Highly recommend getting one with mango. Pictured here: chipotle chicken with mango, butter shrimp, dippy (steak with onions, mushrooms). Indoor and outdoor seating was available.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>5 Stars because the Food is Delicious!
Portion sizes leave nothing to be missed.
Food was hot and crisp.

My only suggestions (no complaints)
1. We would like more of a restaurant feel (be seated, checked on, served food)  It appears like a sit down restaurant but you order food like a food truck.

2. Fountain Drinks with refills would be a plus.

3. The staff all seemed a bit young and some very inexperienced.  They were polite, but we felt experience with the public was lacking.

Again 5 STARS 🌟  Seriously food is amazing.  A true Cottonwood Gem 💎<//Review><rating>5</rating><Date>1618541125671< /Date>< Response>

<text>Roadrunner Grill in Cottonwood was absolutely amazing!! My family and I got the Grilled chicken mango tacos/ Roadrunner burrito and the cheesy garlic fries which of all was to die for!! If you're looking for a place to eat you HAVE to come here whether you're coming from Redding or Red Bluff you won't be disappointed!! Family owned restaurant with the best staff that will take care of you better than any chain restaurant can. So take your hungry family to the Roadrunner Grill!!< /text>< Pics>

Exceptional food, fast friendly service, great prices. I've been to the Road Runner Grill 9 times so far since I discovered them (just a couple months). They have been amazing every time. Definitely worth a try (or 3). The family who owns/runs this place are good people. I recommend the steak and chicken mango tacos with a rose iced tea - you won't be disappointed no matter what you order!<//Review>

This place started out as a food service truck and now has a restaurant location. I'm sad to say I never had the opportunity to eat from the truck but I'm so glad they now have a restaurant in Cottonwood. Their restaurant location is on front street and not Olive st(I think Olive st was the truck location).

I  have never been more impressed with the food then I was today when I first eat there. I got a few tacos but my favorite was the buffalo chicken taco. It sounded so different that I almost didnt get it but man I'm I glad I did. I'm telling everyone about this place and can't wait to go back and try more new taco flavors. Although I haven't tried the fish and chip they did look amazing.

Everyone need to try this place.< /review>

Best Shrimp chipotle taco I have EVER had. The tortilla was thin like it was handmade and toasted to perfection, not too brittle not too soft. Plenty of shrimp and topped with all of the right fixins including a generous helping of cotija cheese.
The young man who took our order was courteous, helpful and respectful. Not something you find much these days.
Highly recommended<//Text>

<Review>Best tacos in Shasta County. The owners are cool, the staff is polite, taco shop was clean. I really like their surf and turf tacos (steak and shrimp), their flavored tea, and their garlic fries. Highly recommend this place if coming to Cottonwood.<//Review>< pictures>

<Name>Andrew Claassen</Name><Text>This is place is so good, everything is fresh and well seasoned. Locally owned by a great Cottonwood family. The barbecue chicken tacos and the surf and turf tacos are my fav. Also recommend the garlic and cheese fries and the tea. A great flavor for that is elderberry and red raspberry. After I finished my first tea the gentlemen at the front called me by my name and asked if he could top me off. Great great service, the food is also very fast. 100% recommend this place, 10/10.</Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
When we found out there was a Mexican restaurant in Carmel, we had to go there. And it did not disappoint. We started off with margaritas and a watermelon salad. The drinks were great and the salad had a lot of flavor. Their entrees were a good size and delicious as well. We really liked this place and came back the next night for more margaritas.<//Review>

<pics>None</pics><review>The service and employee were 5 star!!! But unfortunately the beans and rice were very bland and the Tacos were fresh but nothing extremely flavorful. The middle eastern breakfast yogurt also lacked any flavor. I feel bad because the ambiance was beautiful and our servers were top notch! Great people, just needs to revamp the menu and add more flavor.</review><time>1583449298064< /time><user>103939103733099633235< /user><Resp>None</Resp><name>Khrisela Kerbey</name></record></dataset><record>

<review>We picked this place because we were craving Mexican food. When we arrived and looked at the menu, we thought we went to the wrong restaurant (completely different international dishes). Server explained that it changed ownership 3 days ago. The food was not good- salsa was basically just chopped tomatoes. The Roasted Beets salad was beets from a can (server and owner admitted and apologized for it). Steak taco was a bit salty with beans and rice (which was a strange yellow rice with carrots). The only decent thing was the guacamole. The staff was very friendly and the owner apologized multiple times. I think they have growing pains and may take time to be decent. It is not a Mexican restaurant.</review>< rate>

This restaurant has a great menu, prices are reasonable and drinks are good, service is a little slow and only one bathroom, but they are very kind. Homemade tortillas. The salsa is a 10 plus. I definitely will return over and over again. That's why I said 4 star's. I like the family ambiance. I'll return with my girlfriend again!!!!!!.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Best restaurant in Carmel by the Sea.  We had salads, main course, dessert, and tea after the meal.  Food was spectacular, Sevilen wine was outstanding, dessert was phenomenal, service was very friendly and hospitable.  Food is fresh and prepared in house.  I had the stuffed eggplant (Karniyarik) and my wife had the Kofte.  Even the Baklava is made there!  Wow!  An all around A+.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_HUFswlZ4xqFIQofjaUvXgretV_eR3slUXeet=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Mediocre food and service.  Zero ambience.  Could be great if soulful effort put forth worthy of 25 bucks a plate but it's just not there.</review>

<text>Lovely service and atmosphere. They play Mexican music as you eat. The chips, salsa, and guacamole are my favorite. Waiters really know the menu and what to reccomend. There are yummy options for vegetarians like me. There are vegan options as well.<//text><UserId.>111706283028720275195<//UserId.><Date>1557082582221</Date>< name>

<Text>We vacationed in Carmel recently and ate dinner here - the food was great! What made it extra special was the kind, attentive, and friendly service. You could tell the folks who worked there took pride in their food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I saw a server bring over a candle centerpiece for a couple who was eating at the bar - it was a simple gesture but it was very sweet!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Review>My husband and I just moved to Carmel from Los Angeles.   We decided to walk in today about 2:00 pm and give it a try.    The food  was decent (not authentic Mexican food.  American Mexican food).  However, Ruben the waiter could not have been more RUDE to us.  I mean wow.  He was rude to everyone including a father and infant waiting for a table.    I’m a former waitress so for me, it was pretty disgusting as to how VERY rude he was.  He even looked mad.  Bad day maybe? Hate your job? NO excuse!

I didn’t take it personal but let’s just say we decided to take our food to go instead because he sucked all of the good energy out of the restaurant.

Shame on management for noticing.  It was obvious.   As new residents of the neighborhood, we will never walk in here again.< /Review>< Time>

<text>In a community where there are literally great restaurants on every corner, its hard to stand out. Yet, this quant place does so with a charming interior, caring and attentive staff (two of whom I believe are the owners) and really delicious Mexican dishes. The guacamole is hand made and a slightly spicier version...a welcome improvement. The sauces and spices used were highly flavorful and felt more "real" than what we usually get. A worthy stop in this food crazy town.</text><gmapID>0x808de6152181b435:0x43a003242aa0af1e< /gmapID><Name>Michael Rock</Name>< Rating>

Our server, Juan was awesome. The food , unfortunately is a different story.  We ordered two vegetarian meals. The Tostado was puffy and overcooked. The content was very small and some of the ingredients were unrecognizable. The other entree was basically inedible, cactus something or other. The 5-star reviews must be from customers ordering meat dishes.  We had two Spanish sparkling wines, and one bottled beer. Our check was $63. Overpriced? Definitely.
Our one-star is for our server, Juan.
There are many traditional Mexican restaurants in this area that offer delicious, less expensive dishes.. Please visit them, and save your money.< /Review>

Chips and salsa showed up before we ordered, and the salsa was exceptionally good as were the chips.  Guacamole was fresh, tasty, made tableside and chips perfect.  Food was amazing!! Super tasty!!!! Margaritas were up there at very very good! Service was exceptionally good! Wish I had one of these in my town!  I give it 5 stars!</Text>

Food was just okay. Staff was very nice but just enough servers. Our server was running around like a headless chicken. We spent a lot of time waiting. He was very kind though which made it a little more tolerable.</Text>

Such a great restaurant, manager was so warm and welcoming to my family, the food was delicious and light. Might be pricey for some but totally worth it. This is honestly one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in the area.< /Text>

Stumbled across Artemis while heading over to try a different establishment. Was intrigued by the menu items, and thought we would give it a try.

So glad we did!  The Cornmeal Encrusted Seabass with Curry Mashed Potatoes & the Short Ribs Raviolis were amazing!! The service was also outstanding!!

Everything was just perfect actually.

They have a fairly diverse menu, but the kitchen seems to be delivering on all of them. Would easily recommend this eatery to anyone.</review>

The food was just brilliant. We took the Seafood Spaghetti, the Octopus Salad, and the Lamb Wrap, and everything was delicious. The Octopus Salad we asked to change the salad from Arugula to Green, and it was accommodated. The place is clean, tastefully decorated, and our waiter was friendly and felt authentic. Given the many dining options in Carmel, it would be a shame to go back to this place next time we visit, instead of exploring other places, but it was so good I'm tempted.<//Text>

<Review>We spent 2 weeks in California and stopped at a number of great Mexican places. This was our favourite overall. Amazing food and great service. Recipes customised to our needs (switched fish for beef for a pescatarian and it tasted great), guacamole prepared fresh on the table, unlimited chips and salsa, friendly waiter. We'll be coming back next time we're back!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><date>1548601114479<//date>< user_id>

MY REVIEW IS FOR ARTEMIS NOT VILLA SOMBREROS! So sorry it closed! A very special friend came into town over Mother’s Day weekend. She loves “great” restaurants and is always telling of new places she finds in Sacramento. We decided to try Artemis on Ocean Avenue. We had the very best dinner there. She had the filet mignon and told me it was cooked to perfection. It melted in her mouth like butter. I had the salmon with fresh vegetables and fingerling potatoes. Excellent! We were both sharing our dishes with each other. It was so good that we went back the next night to have dinner again. You won’t be disappointed. Mark was our waiter and took good care of us! We look forward to returning to this new gem of a restaurant in Carmel!!! So sorry they closed Artemis! ☹️</Review>

<text>Me and my girlfriend are here and they have the best chicken and quesadillas.  This looked like a new place and was glad I came by.  The guac is to die for and the service by the staff is great.  It's a little more expensive than some of the other Mexican restaurants but definitely worth the money.<//text><Time>1554826982097</Time><userid>104285103075629963234< /userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rating>

<pics>None<//pics><date>1558933689113<//date><text>Was hoping for so much more especially for the location. The restaurant is fairly small. We were 1 of maybe 3 tables being occupied at the time. There was one server. We went during lunch time. I placed my order with the server which she repeated to me incorrectly. I corrected her. Several minutes later she returned to confirm our orders having us realize the kitchen hadn't even started firing it up yet. She once again tried to confirm an incorrect order. She was corrected again, twice, because I was getting worried. When our food arrived it was completely wrong and exactly how she had been erroneously trying to confirm prior. She told me just to eat around what I didn't order and a separate plate was brought out with the correct sides. I ordered an iced tea and was told there was not enough left. She had stated she would bring their pozole soup for my daughter but never did and had to be reminded when the food arrived. The food was bland and there was a spice, perhaps cinnamon or nutmeg, that was very overwhelming. Such a disappointing experience. We will not return and do not expect for it to last long in Carmel if experiences like ours are the norm. Price for 2 item combo was close to $20 per plate. The positive, rice was decent and cooked well.</text></record></dataset><record>

The salsa and guacamole was delicious however. The main problem here is the service. We had to ask four times for more chips and they finally arrived right as we were leaving. The waiter also was telling a table waiting for us that we were taking long and apologized for the wait. At that point we had been trying to get a check to leave for quite literally 20 minutes. We finally had to go up to the bar and wait for a check there so we wouldn't be late meeting some friends.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Wow. I usually don't leave bad reviews instead I just don't review it. If you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing. But I am making an exception to this place. I don't know were the high star reviews came from. We were looking for a place to eat after a morning at the beach with the family, and saw the high star reviews and decided to try it. It was a very bad experience. Despite there being only two tables of less than three people and us a party of six with three front house people everything took forever. While we waited to order after having asked for drinks, two other tables came in and left after minutes of just sitting. First red flag. There was a couple sitting next to us that appeared to have finished their queso fundido long ago, when their food arrived. The gentleman just had a bite of his beef tacos and stopped eating, although his companion just stuck to finishing the plate quickly - we at the time assumed he didn't have a big appetite. Second red flag. By this time we had waited 10 minutes to order after having gotten our aguas frescas. The menu items looked promising albeit pricey for common Mexican food -not high dinning. As soon as we ordered the couple next to us asked for their check, it took 15 minutes for the check to arrive, by then we knew we had made a mistake to stick around. We waited 45 for our food and even asked since the other table had just recieved theirs. As soon as we asked about the delay our food started to come in person by person. First dish on the table were the chicken taquitos. The chicken mole taquitos were cold, the sauce watery, and the chicken in them barely had any mole we even asked what had happened to the mole -in their defense they brought us a side of mole. Minutes later, the Guadalajara tacos  made their appearance on the table. The meat was over cooked and didn't taste like Mexican seasoning, although the presentation was great and portions were a decent size. However, the biggest faux paus was that the tortillas for the tacos took minutes to arrive so rice and beans were eaten first. We had asked for three orders of tacos  but only got tortillas for two orders so one person had to wait extra time. When we asked about the whereabouts of the third order we were told they were out. And we had to wait for more to be made. Lastly the mole came in, which was watery and tasted store bought only enhanced with a stick of cinnamon in the process. The meal was overpriced for the quality and time we waited, around 20 dollars per plate. I have had better tasting, authentic, and faster Mexican food out of food trucks in Oakland or San Francisco for half the price. During the entire time we never got asked for a refill on our drinks and we dared not asked for fear of waiting 15 minutes for it. I am a person who has been around the restaurant business for decades, and do not mind the wait or price if service and food are of quality. However, this place didn't have the service or quality. The only thing I can say is that the presentation of some of their plates is great, and their tortillas are hand made and good quality. As we were leaving the lady who makes the tortillas set up shop and was making the tortillas to the public by the window. It was cool to see that and that is why I give them a star.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Great, comfortable, friendly and the food is fantastic. There we could meet Michael, a guy who made the CA-1 by bike!

We highly recommend you to go there when I. Carmel-by-the-Sea.<//text>

Must try lamb shanks - delightfully soft and flavorful
Reservations are better as is the case with most restaurants in the area, especially on weekends.
All in all, I loved the place and would definitely recommend!</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Local refined in its simplicity. Excellent food, interesting wine list. The price is high compared to the type of cuisine but in line with similar Carmel restaurants. Excellent service. Overall an experience that I would do with pleasure.

(Translated by Google) Excellent food and lovely staff. I was wrong and I tipped a $ 100 bill when I wanted to drop a $ 10 bill and they ran me over to the sidewalk to return it to me. But honesty is just an unexpected addition to a wonderful dining experience that is more than worth a try. Also prices are very affordable for what is Carmel by the Sea. Highly recommended.

Excelente comida y personal encantador. Me equivoque y deje de propina un billete de 100 dólares cuando queria dejar uno de 10 y me corrieron a la acera para devolvermelo. Pero la honestidad es solo un aditamento inesperado, a una experiencia gastronómica maravillosa que justifica sobradamente probarlo. Ademas los precios son muy acomodados para lo que es Carmel by the Sea. Muy recomendable.<//Review>

This is such a great little hole-in-the-wall. It's in Downtown Alum Rock (I think), and is never crowded. It has such a chill environment. TVs were playing the World Cup as well as baseball when we went. I ordered the nopale scrambled eggs with fried potato discs, as well as a fish taco, and my boyfriend ordered the pozole with corn tortillas. Both dishes were DELICIOUS. My eggs were busting with cactus pieces, and the flavor was so savory and cactus-y. The fish taco was delectable; the fish pieces were extremely tender and juicy, and seasoned perfectly. Bonus points for having fresh avocado slices!!

My boyfriend was sweating from the heat of his pozole, but still couldn't stop stuffing his face with the bright red soupy goodness in front of him. Service was friendly and quick as well.

I highly recommend this place!!!<//Text>

<review>Make sure you season the soup by adding the salt, loads of green onion, chili paste and cabbage kimchi inside the soup. This is what makes the soup.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The food was good. I had the Colorado Beef. Comes with beans and rice and salad. The salad was about 4 fork fulls.
The beef and sauce was delicious as was the rice and beans.
I only gave them 3 stars because it took over 40 minutes to cook in an empty restaurant.
Staff was kind.< /review>

<Text>Took my Mom and a friend to Sunday breakfast at Linda's. The small but comfortable restaurant  was brightly painted with decorated walls and big televisions to watch the Giants play while we ate. The service was great. It felt as if we were eating at a friend's place. Smiles and friendly greetings when we arrived.
The chips were hard and thick. The salsa was of a mild to medium heat. Nice to taste the individual ingredients as opposed to just hot and burning. Mom  and her friend both order Bacon and Eggs, which they reported " really good bacon", eggs cooked just as ordered,  potatoes in thick round slices, tasty refried beans and good flour tortillas. They were happy with their meals and kept talking about the good sliced potatoes.
I had the Menudo. It was a large bowl with plenty of tripe, and very good broth. It was served with lemon wedges, chopped onion, dried Chile's, oregano and flour tortillas. I asked for cilantro, and it was promptly delivered. I would definitely order the menudo again.
Try Linda's for a  wonderful meal, in a casual and friendly atmosphere, at a reasonable price.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>At Linda's Restaurant you will have a great authentic Mexican atmosphere. The food is by far delicious. The music is amazing, on the louder​side but not unbearable. Just depends if you sit at the bar or in the restaurant side. They have really great michalada of your choice. And the service is very nice.< /Text><date>1491091034068< /date><user_id>115496843667189370815<//user_id>< Rating>

Bill presented to us was $26.00,
Charge on my card was $27.95!
It's not the amount that makes me mad,
It is that no one said anything about the service fee at all! When I asked about it, the waitress pointed to a small piece of paper on the side of the counter below the register, and then to another small printed piece of paper on the wall next to the register, but behind a "juke box" machine. Niether are visible when you walk in and after you've eaten its too late.
This to me is poor management, and/or customer service.
I won't  be going back! 😡< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Amazing asada tacos with pico de gallo fresh made and guacamole not  hot but with a lot flavor. This restaurant ist part of the town at Santa Clara & 24 street. Clean place and  nice people, ambience really friendly and lovely place to eat breakfast lunch or dinner or maybe just one drink.<//text>

(Translated by Google) We are not from San José and we were looking for a good Mexican food as we saw that it had more than four stars we dared to enter but the truth is very disappointing very salty my shrimp broth that I am salty and I earn the only good thing were the beans 🤭

(Translated by Google) It will not be 5 stars but it is better because here you feel more comfortable and in confidence the food is good and even at a normal price, the staff is friendly and helpful.

No sera 5 estrellas pero es mejor por k aqui te sientes mas agusto y en confianza la comida es buena y aun precio normal, el personal es amable y servicial..< /Review>

COLD! Ordered a #1 combo.  Geese enchilada is cold with bagged shredded cheese, not melted. Disgusting. Chicken taco was to be shredded as he said when I asked and it was a cold chunk of brown meat. Terrible. Will not go back!</Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>I ordered my regular California burrito through Uber eats, I was delivered a shrimp burrito instead. I called the restaurant They told me they had made a mistake so I had to drive to the restaurant to pick up my California burrito that I ordered without cheese or guacamole. The woman at the cash register refused to remake my burrito after that the restaurant messed up my order twice. I even called down ahead of time to make sure they got the order details correct. I normally get good service at this establishment but the woman working the cash register on the afternoon shift was very rude and non-accommodating when the restaurant was clearly in the wrong< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
if you’re looking for tongue tacos: do NOT go here, the tongue is cooked differently than regular street tacos, it was burnt and with a lot of fat (barely any meat; $8 wasted) the asada and al pastor tacos were 2/10... there are better places around the area than this one.</review>

<Review>This spot is mind meltingly dank I ordered their pulled pork sandwich with macaroni. The porks flavor was artistically perfect, the roll cradled the meat and it never got soggy, the pickles were solid, last but not least the macaroni was delicious very cheesy and rich. 6/5 stars<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Heard rave reviews about this place, pricey $12 for just a sandwich but they do pile up on the meat! Garlic bread and the sides are tasty - collard greens, coleslaw, baked beans. So far we've tried links, brisket and tri-tip, will be back for more. The spot is tucked away, lookout for the truck<//Review><user_name>SJ< /user_name>< user>

<Review>Five stars is not enough. We had the tri tip and the brisket which were both extremely flavorful, tender, and moist. The collard greens were perfect, cook down with a ham bone, hint of spice and not overcooked. Amazing!!! If we lived here we would be here all the time!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
The greatest BBQ I've tasted! Very flavorful.  The peach cobbler with a side of Ice cream is so good,  homemade flavor!!  They also have an outside food truck and outdoor seating. I drove from Woodland Hills just for this BBQ.<//Review>

I haven't been inside their restaurant as it's closed for the inside portion during this whole thing going on.

I'm greeted immediately when I walk up to the window. They take my order quality.
The food comes out in a timely manner, can't complain.

With that said let's move onto the food!

I've tried almost everything on the menu but the desserts.

Ribs. seasoned well. Smoked to perfection. Falls off the bone. Great flavor and cooked well. I'd say this alone is worth going for. Especially with the spicy bbq sauce.

Hot links. Spicy and grilled well. These are good with the none spicy bbq sauce since the hot links are already spicy. Perfect balance with the normal sauce.

Mac & cheese. SO good true homemade style Mac N' Cheese. What there to not like about that?

Baked bbq beans. Dip it with their garlic bread and you're in for a treat to the taste buds. And to the stomach. I may have indulged a bit to much of the bread and beans. May have gained some weight LOL.

Coleslaw. Sweet and savory yet refreshing. Especially while eating some heavy bbq meats.

Pulled pork. Savory moist smoked seasoned to perfection. If you like pulled pork sandwiches. I without a doubt know you'll enjoy this.

Would I recommend this place? Most definitely.
For the quality and quantity of food the prices are MORE then fair. This is true BBQ.
Plus the staff is quick and extremely nice.

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars isn't entirely their fault but still how I do my grading.

Food quality
Food pricing
Service

Decor ( almost deducted another star from this. But I didn't due to the food truck being displayed very well and the menu being very clear )

Cleanliness ( since they're outside using their food truck I couldn't comment on how I give my 5th star ) so there you have it. I hope that this is understandable.

Food: above average

Decor: N/A it's out of their food truck at the moment in the back.

Customer service: no issues at all. Fast and professional service.

<text>Today they had their catering truck out in Ventura where they were doing the COVID-19 shots. My husband had the half pork half tri tip sandwich, I had the pulled pork. Well I was not sure if I was going to be able to eat the food since I had surgery on my teeth. Well don’t dispare the pulled pork melted in my mouth HEAVEN …. Thank you for being out there and sharing your good food just wish you had a tip jar so I could of tipped you but I understand your giving back to the community that right there just proves to me how there are still grateful people in this world.  God Bless you. See you folks real soon.😊</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I went here with my dad to get some food last weekend. There is a catering truck outside where you order food. They have indoor facilities where they prepare the food. When we went there were outdoor tables to sit at in a very open area all adequately spaced for Covid concerns.

We ordered a meat plate that came with two sides and cornbread (you could get a roll if you want). You get your choice of meats and we ordered brisket, spare ribs, and chicken with cornbread. For the sides we had collard greens and mac & cheese. It cost $22 and was quite filling for two people.

The meats were all cooked perfectly and tasted good even without sauce. We got their spicy bbq sauce to go with and it was excellent. The chicken breast was juicy which takes skill to do on the grill.

The mac & cheese and cornbread were solid. And the collard greens were delicious. I will definitely be hitting up this place again.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Oh my heavens! Ordered delivery from It's in the Sauce for the first time and everything was incredibly delicious! The tri-tip sandwich was smokey deliciousness...and had so much meat inside. The baked beans had a lot of meat inside too and may be the tastiest I've ever had. Finally, the peach cobbler was actually a little pie and was old school all the way. So glad I have enough leftover for a second meal! I will definitely order from here again!</Review>< pics>

We had It's in the Sauce cater a 50th reunion for approximately 250 physicians. The food was delicious, the catering staff were personable and joy to talk to. Greggory and his father Wayne were some of the kindest people I have had the pleasure of working with. The love of family and love of good BBQ food is evident by the service they provide.
We highly recommend It's in the Sauce!< /text>

I moved to SF a few months ago and was a little worried about finding a new hair salon. Veer and Wander was close by my neighborhood so I decided to give it a try. Safe to say I have found my  thick, curly hair’s new home. From the moment you walk in, the entire team is so welcoming and friendly. Cassie is so talented and knowledgeable about hair. She cut and styled my hair in a way that will save me time in the mornings and looks amazing! Absolutely would recommend!!<//text>

<text>Love this place, very pricey but all my fave stylists keep leaving. I’ve been coming here for years and overall it’s a lovely salon that’s tucked away in an alley between Market St and Mission/Castro. I wish my stylists didn’t keep leaving but I keep coming back. Their prices are stupid but given they use great products and have good stylists, I pay the price.<//text>< Pics>

I had such a great experience at Veer & Wander! My stylist Emma did an amazing job coloring my hair (I got a balayage) and enjoyed the experience form start to finish. The salon is also very clean, well kept, and has a trendy atmosphere. I would come here again and will recommend Emma to all my friends!< /Review>

I love this salon and apothecary! Connie does my hair and I always come out looking so good I don't want to wash my hair for days! The apothecary has lots of wonderful products to help you look your best. This place is very inspirational and I highly recommend a visit.</review>

I got a haircut from Cassie a few weeks ago and it was an amazing experience. She really listened to what I wanted and the result is the best haircut I have ever had. In addition to being very pleased with her work, I’ve gotten constant compliments and my hair is super healthy. I am definitely going back to see her next time I need anything hair related.<//review>

<Text>It took me 5 years to find a hairstylist after moving to San Francisco. I have been coming back to see Cassie for 6 months and I can not say enough about her. Not only does she dona killer cut, but she has been working to improve the overall quality and health of my hair. After years of at home DIY jobs its amazing to have the sleek sexy hair i wanted! The place is also really nice and all the staff is super nice. Highly recommended if you need a new place!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

My first time here and I’m loving it! It is open, bright, comfortable and Katie is great. It is always hard to know where to go for your first haircut in a new city, but I think I got lucky on my first try. I highly recommend this place. It is worth the pricing.<//Review>

Always a stylish cut and she's charming, accommodating and very nice. I have long, crazy, curly thick hair and she always manages to tame it and get it looking great. She also hones my daughter's fine, straight hair into a perfect pixie cut. Rachael's versatile, talented and a lovely person (zero attitude) to boot!

This is the third salon I've followed Rachael to. Veer & Wander is located in an, err, often "colorful" section of Market Street...but once you're inside, it's a beautiful, modern space. The Apothecary always tempts with an impressive selection of harder-to-find beauty brands.<//review>< pictures>

This is a really wonderful salon - everything from the cute little shop out front to the friendly, skilled staff was great. I am really pleased with the cut and style that I received. It's a little hidden away (tucked away just off mid-Market - you wouldn't notice it if walking near that area unless you look for it) but now I know its there I will be making it my regular salon.<//Review>

I stumbled upon the salon, waiting for an oil change and was kindly accommodated and connected with Erin.  Over the past year or so I have been going to Veer & Wander, driving all the way Point Reyes.  Erin saved me from a really bad cut.  She provided me great advice and options, on how to best achieve the look I was going for.  The love the design and vibe of the salon - hip without attitude!</review>

<date>1461475156099< /date><review>I followed my amazing stylist Erin to Veer & Wander. She's the best! She is extremely talented, with every aspect of this profession! I would never see anyone else. She's fantastic with color, cut and style, and extremely knowledgeable about product to help nourish, strengthen and maintain healthy hair, which goes hand in hand with all the coloring I do to it. You can trust her to be honest, and leave you always looking and feeling fabulous. The salon itself is full of nothing but authenticity, from the people who work there to the products and service provided by everyone. I love Connie's vision and love the whole ambiance of the salon. Veer & Wander is most definitely The Salon to go to. And Erin's the girl to see!</review>< Response>

Just moved to CA A and really wanted to switch my look up to something a little more sophisticated looking with little to no maintenance needed. Nothing fancy at all, but for some reason, a look I've never quite gotten done right by any other stylist. SO grateful I know Jessica!! She hooked me UP! Super helpful with giving opinions on what style to go with, thorough, and whatever she put in my hair, made it smell hello good (nice). I've gotten nothing but compliments since then and I'm in love with the length! Will DEFINITELY be going back exclusively to get styled by my girl! The salon itself was sheek, bright, and clean.<//text>

Veer & Wander is and experience in itself. Not only is it a beauty in its decor and vibe, but everyone who works there is friendly, and hardworking and always ready to help. The boutique is filled with amazing rare items that make unique gifts. My stylist, Lizzie, is warm, totally talented, and just 100% cool. I always feel like I matter when I go to V&W. And, I leave looking really great too!< /review>

Rachael Anne is the best. This is the third salon I have followed her to, and the least convenient (for me), but she's worth it.

I have crazy thick, wavy, unruly hair that she somehow manages to tame into something respectable. Seriously, she is deeply talented, has a great eye and is a terrific conversationalist. No attitude, she is sweet and smart.

The salon is great, all black and white minimalism, once you make it in the door. Unfortunately you may have to step over a few homeless people to get in that door.<//Review>

<Text>As a recent SF transplant I was desperate to find a salon that could handle my mane. I have a ton of hair and it's frizzy and wiry. Phoebe from Veer & Wander gave me the best cut of my life and I can now say that doing my hair everyday is easy and takes less time and effort than ever. So grateful to have found V & W. Looking forward to getting my color done with Michael!< /Text>< Pictures>

Nope. Based on the reviews was really hopeful that I could get what I've been asking my hairdresser for and she never quite gets it. Wanted some layering in my thick, curly hair and instead the stylist at V& W went crazy thinning my hair. I have about half as much hair as I used to and my hair is now wispy and stringy. It is going to take me months to grow this out. Plus, she just seemed like she really did not want to be there--I asked her one question and she just did not want to speak to me. Maybe she was having a bad day but I felt like I was just annoying her being in the chair. Overall a really bad experience, will not be going back.<//Text>

I have been a faithful customer/devotee of Connie's for 12 years. I love that she is forever attending conferences and workshops to expand her wealth of knowledge and keep up on the latest trends. I also love that after so many years together, she's bold enough to tell me that, no, going platinum for a few weeks *just for fun* is not a wise move (bless her!). Veer & Wander is a cool salon with an urban/industrial vibe ... and lots of hair inspiration floating around with the stylists you'll see here.</review>

Lizzy is worth the trip from Oakland.  I have been getting cuts from her for 12 years and I have referred several people to her who see her regularly now.  Though I can't speak to the haircuts of the other stylists, everyone at Veer & Wander is always friendly and free of drama.<//review>

She is very honest with you and will help you create a complete custom look tailored for you. It's rare to find a stylist that is exceptional at both color and cut.

I go to this salon regularly for hair cuts and have recently purchased some shaving goods. It's an excellent spot with friendly staff and expert professionals providing all the services. I cannot say enough nice things about my stylist, Sarah De Boni. I've always walked away with a great cut and enjoyed it for weeks as it grew out exactly as I wanted as well.

For the true value of services here, this is a great place.< /Text>

< Review>
I found this lovely salon when I was looking for RMS products.  The idea of being a "model" and getting a haircut while helping someone learn the skills sounded like a fun thing to do.  To say the opportunity met all my expectations would be putting it mildly.  I had a wonderful time, got a great haircut, lots of suggestions and product tips and when I am back in SF (I live on the East Coast!!) Veer & Wander will be on my "to do" list.  THANK YOU! THANK YOU  (PS the RMS products did not disappoint either :-)  !)< /Review>

<Review>Steven, my stylist for eleven years and my colorist for the last three, is brilliant. In all this time, he has consistently delivered the perfect style and color.

Steven patiently talks me through various options, and will offer opinions or follow instructions, or do some combination of both - whatever I ask. I feel safe in his hands because I trust his judgment and impeccable sense of style. He is exceptionally creative and precise.

Steven has executed every kind of hairstyle imaginable with me, at all lengths, as well as highlights of various shades and dimensions. He has done a phenomenal job with both cut and color every time. People always ask me where I get my hair done because he is so awesome.

Of less obvious import, but essential to me, is Steven's presence. He is a smart, hilarious, and kind person. I know for a fact that he won't talk to you if you prefer to sit in the chair in silence, but I never want that. I have fun at my appointments because I get to talk to a high quality person. I can't imagine going to anyone else.

In its current incarnation, Veer & Wander has been around for just a few years, but I didn't notice any turnover when it changed names. As far as I know, they only added people, all of whom I like.

The cosmetics counter came in with the name change. I love it. The people on that side have great ideas, and have taken time trying different products on my face to see what works. I really like shopping in there.

Every experience in my decade there has been positive. That's a rare statement to make with any business relationship, and especially one in a service industry focused on the loaded issue of hair.<//Review>< username>

There are a lot of cosmetics, you can buy for a friend, the price is not expensive. The boss is very enthusiastic.</Text>

<Review>Phron McElroy has a great eye for color and shape. I rarely have clear vision when I come in for an appointment, but Phron is always so  patient and helps me think through options. He has a nice balance of listening to my lofty ideas and provides great suggestions on what works best for my type of hair and lifestyle.  Ultimately I always trust what he suggests and have Never been disappointed with the outcome. His cuts also always seem to grow out nicely and are low maintenance. Phron is the perfect balance of very professional, warm and communicative yet also has a great sense of humor. I highly recommend his services 💯 also the salon is a gem! So clean and relaxing.</Review><user_id>111653617096300000149</user_id><rating>5< /rating>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I like Veer and Wander so much, especially Steven and Ursula, that I drive from the Napa Valley to San Francisco for my haircuts.  And have been doing it for years.  I just haven't found anyone else like Steven Kamla who knows better how to cut and style curly hair.
Plus the studio is so inviting and stylish.  There are tillansia and succulents scattered among the apothecary and vintage industrial decor.  The body care and cosmetics are well made and wonderful to use, and of course, they carry Kevin Murphy cream for curly hair, which is perfect for my easy care style.
A perfect salon in every way!< /review>< Pictures>

Holy moly, have been here twice and this place totally blows me away every time with what they can do with my hair. I shaved my head last summer, and as anyone who has shaved their head before knows, the growing out process is AWKWARD. I was about 8 months into roughing this out and sporting a pretty terrible/shapeless mullet thing, but Atsuko is a miracle worker.

I was skeptical that she would be able to do much with my hair since it's still fairly short and uneven, but after an artful cut, my hair has been shaped into an adorable Louise Brooks-style bob that looks edgy and will grow out nicely. Cannot sing enough praises to Atsuko and the rest of the stylists here, they are true experts and I am beyond happy to be looking more like my former self again! My only regret is not having come in sooner to chop the mop!<//text>

Hung - technician. Outstanding! Checked my SUV first (free). Told me to run car on hwy 4 on 'cruise control.' My Highlander 'passed' all smog emissions * Praise God! $58, including Certificate. Highly recommend Pinole business.< /text>

Made engine oil and filter change (I supplied both), rotated tires, checked break pads thickness.  Done in reasonable time,  price is acceptable. Will try a break pads replacement with them when have a chance.</text>

<review>Wanted to see about a diagnosis of possibly my u joints being bad. Didn't want any work done besides the diagnosis which I was prepared to pay cash . Young black guy was cool and ready to do his job but his unprofessional boss couldn't do anything but shake his head and say no.not even a recommendation to a better equipped shop. These guys are sub par wouldn't trust em for nothing but an oil change and even then it's iffy.<//review></record>

<Text>When visiting my mother-in-law, I found that her 2012 Tucson was overdue for routine maintenance.  As this is probably going to remain her daily driver for a while, we decided it would be a good idea to establish a relationship with a reputable shop in the area who could take care of mom even when we were not in town.  A friend of the family had recommended AccuTech in Pinole.  Even though it was a little bit of a drive, it proved to be worth it. David, the service manager, took the car in and was able to quickly identify the necessary maintenance from the service schedule.  Further, he did not recommend anything unnecessary and I felt we received excellent value for the price we paid.  Additionally, I also like the fact that Kevin, the owner, and his family have all worked in the automotive industry their whole lives.  It is nice to be able to support this family run business.  I would not hesitate to recommend AccuTech to anyone!<//Text><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>104853483876250226542</user_id>< rate>

I have had several repairs performed by Accutech.  New air struts, a new power steering pump,  and a rear hatch lock for my Mercedes, plus several smog checks over the years: all good and reasonable.  Thanks Accutech !< /text>

Accu Tech Auto Care is  Awesome!!!
Everyone there is Polite, Caring & Very Knowledgeable!!! Friendly & they will give u a Ride Home & Back while working on ur  vehicle if you need it.
I’ve going there many years for Oil Changes & Smog. ( I had a Friend who is a  mechanic so he would do other Stuff)
Well the last time I took to Tech Auto they explained other things I needed done. I knew about them I said Go Ahead Price was Right On.

For standard service (brake pads, oil change, etc.) they do acceptable work.  I had bad experiences with more elaborate work (fixing malfunctioning mixing damper for cabin air conditioning system, and brake piston maloperation).  I stopped going here after they closed several hours early on a Friday with my van (my only vehicle) in their custody, rendering me incapable of getting groceries for my family until they deigned to give me my vehicle back the next day.</Review>< Time>

Good place for large parties as gives a cheap alternative. I wish they have some more option s but never mind the price and the quality they offer cant complain. The place is really cozy and best value for money.<//Review>

I just stopped by 15 minutes before close and was refused a pizza. I was offered crazy bread and cheese bread but refused to help me with a pizza. A simple order thin crust pepperoni pizza. Easy as heck to make. I come here often

Ive worked pizza for 8 years. Ive had to make people’s orders 1 minute before close. 15 minutes is not unreasonable. Thanks for the help. I really like your pizza but this experience was awful. Dude that was working.....super lazy.<//Review>

This has been hit or miss for me over the last two years.  Overall, the service is quick, but can vary between being short, to friendly.  The pizza doesn't disappoint - you get what you pay for in terms of decent, inexpensive pizza.</Text>

<Text>My friend and I split a pizza and it was pretty good. We got the $6 fresh and ready pepperoni and it took only seven minutes to pick up.

Great location. Pizza was really yummy. I know most probably notice that they've stepped up their game as far as quality goes.  My only -star was for communication barrier as we couldn't understand the order taker and he didn't really understand our needs and the timeliness of receiving the pizza. Other than that,. All was well.  It's always good to grab pizza while packing & moving . 🍕< /Review>

<Review>Called to place an order.  It was super basic, stuff crust pizza with sausage.  The order taker said so a pepperoni pizza?  I repeated my order and the response was "so cancel the pepperoni and add sausage."  I tried to explain once again and he hung up on me!  Super Classy.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Just came home only to find that my crazy bread is essentially nothing was nothing more than the equivalent of generic prepackaged bread with not garlic butter on it. Real crazy bread is made from scratch dough that is made in store. Worker was indifferent in all ways. Quite possible this is a Little Caesars is operating without a current/legit franchise agreement. Just wasted $7.50 and the person would not even give me a receipt. Avoid or go at your own peril.<//text>< response>

I said "extra sauce" and they took me seriously. Usually I say that to just get a standard amount of sauce I think should be on a pizza. I wasn't ready and I liked it a lot.<//Text>

Employee here was rude and condescending. Repeatedly yelled at me and rolled his eyes at other customers. My Little Ceasars gift card (which worked at another location) wouldn’t swipe properly  and this guy was unwilling to even see if he could manually type in the code. Mocked me for having a card that didn’t work and asked “where I bought the card.”<//Text>

Ordered a extra most bestest stuffed crust pizza and they tried giving me one left over from the hot box which is not how it should be, they should always be made fresh they are not the same as hot n ready pizzas which is why customers pay more then they also "accidently" charged me $5.81 for 4 ranch cups which they "happily" refunded and then charged me the correct price of $2.79 i don't know if this is just a isolated incident or if try this stuff all the time but they didn't fool me so if your planning of going here my advice is pay close attention.< /Text>

<Review>I had the worst experience with the worst customer service i have ever had with a pizza restaurant. ....these guys don't even care if your happy or not. ..I made an order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 15min. ...I left my place with a half hour to give them. ..when i got there. ...they  not only did not make it yet. ..but could care less that i said something about it. ....I waited the whole time for them to make it.  It defeats the purpose of calling in. They then proceeded to give me older chicken wing's rather than giving me new ones. ....I don't recommend this place after 5pm, actually, i dont recomend this place at all.    Not sure if i delt with a night manager. ..but if i did. ...he wasn't worth minimum wage. ....< /Review>< Pictures>

I just got off the phone with Russell who helped me sign up for a storage unit. I called in earlier with some questions on how the process works, and Russell was notified I was interested in a specific spot so he called to let me know how to make the best decision about it. Renting a space over the phone was very easy - he patiently walked me through each step. He even helped explain each section in the contract I was signing, which I appreciated. I’m looking forward to moving my stuff in!</Text>

Russell and Kelsie are troopers with professionalism.  Within 24 hours of booking my appointment (on a holiday), Kelsie had me singed & sealed by close of business the following day.  She ensured I was squared away on my new space while showcasing what makes Extra Space better than the competition.  A true VIP experience, thank you.</text>

Not only was Kelsey amazingly kind in regards with the issues of what's going on with my life. She was honest when I asked her questions about renting, she told me all the benefits of why it's important to get insurance.

<Review>Absolutely amazing! They were patient and answered all of my questions regarding their policies, they took the time to show me the unit so I could get a visual idea of how much space I actually needed! They even showed me how to use the gate which I greatly appreciate it! Even being the cheapest on the market their property is extremely clean and tidy!! All renter seem respectful of people unloading and loading their items from the vehicles. I’ve recommended them to everybody I’ve talked to so far!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I’ve only met Kelsie so far but she was so patient and helpful. I arrived 5 minutes prior to closing but she was as helpful as if the day just begun. She pulled a golf cart back out and toured the facility with me. She made sure I saw all the options available. She stayed much later than closing time to ensure I had everything figured out and that my access code worked properly. It was a real pleasure.</text>< pictures>

Great overall experience. The tele-sales at first was not 100% accurate re storage benefits but they got the job done. Ultimately, the onsite manager (in Menlo Park Russell) finished our paperwork and is an expert in the area of storage. he helped us understand all the ins-and-outs of our storage needs and happy we are working with his team and location! 5 stars for Russell and MP team -1 star for tele-sales = 4 stars. :-)<//review>

To Extra Space Storage Corporate Team-

The extra space storage on Willow Road in Menlo Park is a good example of what storage facilities should be like. Manager -Russell and Kelsie are doing and outstanding job. They are positive and respectful to their valued customers.  The facility is clean up-to-date and organized. I’ve noted that Kelsie shows a true and genuine dedication to superior service.

Respectfully,   Dan</review>

This place is a RIP off,the only thing they do is raise the price.
There security is a joke,any body with a unit can access other  units no cameras.
I have item's  removed mostly tools and electronics.Nothing done.
On a 292 dollar  unit late fee 250 late fee.They don't  confirm electronic payments like they should.

< Review>
I had my ups and downs with different storage locations. Believe me I got stories, like most people most aren't good. However working with Kelsie at the Palo Alto/Menlo Park location made my experience a good one. Always answering my questions and concerns, explaining the pros and cons, and the benefits of their location. She always has a smile, is very professional, and on a good day has jokes. Whenever I had a problem, she was always trying to see what could be done to better assist me. It's hard to get good service now a day, so I am never disappointed when Kelsie is there to help. I recommend this location because you get nothing but the best and real customer service with a smile.</Review>

<review>Had a great experience yesterday 4/18/19! When I checked in I was greeted by the manager that was filling in for the day (typically works in EPA). He made a typical painful process fun and positive.

This was one of the most positive customer service experiences I have had in a long time. Thank you Nate and I hope your daughter had a great 1st birthday!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Met with Renee and Ed and it was a very pleasurable experience. They were very friendly and will definitely refer people to their facility. They made me and my wife feel like we have known them for a very long time. It was great knowing there are great, kind, and caring people still out there. I know picking this storage place was a great choice and I  am sure it will be great for everyone else. Thank you Renee and Ed and we will be looking forward to seeing you guys in the future!!!< /text>

I am very happy with my experience at Extra Space. The manager, Felix, was immediately welcoming and extremely helpful. He had my reservation ready for my appointment and promptly showed me to the storage unit so I could decide if it had enough space. He explained all of the procedures, double checked to make sure my gate codes were working, and answered any and all questions I had. Very professional and friendly. The facility is very nice and obviously well maintained. Definitely recommended.< /Text>

Right so, you know, I have stuff. Dropped it off here today, with the help of Rom, a guy in Colma who was covering and a lady in Colma, and the lady on the phone. It costs $24 for one month. Helped a lady with her mattress. And broke Al Canpinpin’s coffee pot. EDIT: Move out went good. Like I said, it's $24 for the free month. They highly encourage reviews for their internal competitions between stores. I have no problem helping my buddy Rom out by writing this review, tied to my name, enscribed here.< /text>

< Review>
I just rented a storage unit from the Extra Space Storage at 1520 Willow, where Felix is the manager and his wife, Rene, is also working there.

After I reserved a storage unit online, I received a confirmation via email right away and also a reminder of the date. My first impression about this facility when I first got to the office was that Felix welcomed me with a smile and explained everything very clear to me and set up my account. He showed the unit, the floor plan and ways to access my unit.

I drove a couples of times to bring my stuffs to the unit. Every time I was there, I usually saw Felix checking and maintaining the facility and his wife cleaning the place. No wonder the facility always looks clean and neat.

At one time, I had to go to my unit late at night (around 9 pm) and I expressed my concern about the safety at night, both Felix and Rene assured me that the place was safe and informed me that the police station was on the opposite of the road. The information did help me feel better.

Since I just moved to the area, they also gave very useful information regarding where to visit, have good food, or donate some stuffs.

Felix and Rene, thank you for being so helpful and keeping the facility clean.<//Review>

I had a wonderful experience with Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park. Renee and the folks there are always so friendly and easy to work with. They have gone out of their way to make me happy on more than one occasion.
The facilities are clean, safe, and well kept.
There is no doubt I will go back to Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park the next time I need storage space. I can't say enough good things about them!<//Text>

Since this facility has taken on new management and a new name, I have had nothing but the most delightful experiences with the employees.  Renee and Felix are two amazing individuals.  They are kind, helpful, and very respectful of their customers.  I hope that this facility continues to maintain its report with its new and used customers.<//review>

<Review>Felix, the site manager is a very nice and knowledgeable, and when I did not know what to do, he helped me with every steps of the process. The facility is very clean and organized. I am very impressed with the way Felix spend his time with me to ensure I am all set and ready to move my stuff in. A great place to store your stuff!<//Review>< user_id>

I have been a renter until last month for the last three years, I no longer needed storage but almost wished I did because of the excellent experience that I had there. The managers Renee and Felix Moya are so sweet and helpful, professional yet so personable. I will miss them both, and for anyone that has storage needs, this facility is clean and well maintained, online services easy and user friendly and again management can't be beat. Highly recommended!</text>

<Review>Rented a 10x20 unit for 16 months to store full household of furniture. Location is fairly convenient relative to major roads. They raised prices three times during the 16 months, ended with $571/month. Front desk is fairly helpful but we didn't ask much of them so can't give assessment there. Besides being extremely expensive, it was a good experience for the first 12 moths...

When I recently returned to the unit to move out, I discovered rats or mice had laid droppings everywhere. While our stuff was well-packed and we incurred very little permanent damage, the extent of contamination was ridiculous. Once we moved everything out, the entire floor was covered in droppings. I also noticed large rodent traps around the entire facility that weren't there before, so I am assuming this a new development.

When I brought this up to management, the head lady at the front desk did not take responsibility for the issue, and suggested that we likely caused the infestation due to food items stored in the unit. We have never stored food items in the unit. This is a property-wide issue at this facility and it's awful. The fact that the local management doesn't want to own it is unfortunate for the Extra Space brand at large, and we let corporate know.

Before you consider storing anything of value here, make sure you review the contractual terms to ensure the facility assumes liability for rodent infestation. My guess is that they won't since they know they have a huge problem, and you should take your business elsewhere.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fbc983c732079:0xd82e3c3c4ad3b716</gmap_id>< UserId.>

< Review>
Ray helped me with accurate knowledge of both the facility and storage process., He had a professional manner and a friendly attitude. The office, grounds and my storage area was shown to me and everything was immaculate. I would recommend ExtraSpace Storage to anyone. And Ray at the Menlo Park office was super.

By chance I found a closer to home and less expensive outdoor space for my RV.
If that does not work out, I will definitely check back with these good folks.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1493051312508, 'text': 'Great to hear about your pleasant experience here at Extra Space, Fred.

I had a great experience -- Felix went through all of the details with me and helped me select a unit to fit my needs at the best available price.

Much easier and simpler than expected!< /review>

< Review>
I’ve used a number of storage space providers - one thing that seems consistent is that ExtraSpace is always well-maintained and very clean.

I just went and opened one at the Menlo Park location (I’m a current customer in Marina del Rey at another ExtraSpace facility) because I needed a space to drop some things off while I’m moving and since I’m an existing customer, signup was basically a few mouse clicks to get me started. Very nice front desk guy, very professional, and Ihad a great time chatting with him as well.<//Review>

I've been storing my things at this storage facility for the past four years and never had a problem up until now. When I came to pick up a few things there were rat poop all over my furniture, all over foor and boxes. Disgusting! I will complain to the manager.  Do not store your things at this facility. Im sure it is not covered by the insurance. Extra space clean up your facility at menlo park on willow  las road</Review>

The facility is clean, our move in was quick and efficient and we always found that the staff were friendly and ready to assist in any way they could.
We moved out today and if we need storage again in the future we will be back.  I fully recommend Ed and ExtraSpace on Willow Road in Menlo Park. CA< /text>< Pics>

<Name>Doge & Apryl Äeschbacher< /Name><review>Extra Space Storage, is conveniently located. Outstanding prices for the size unit we needed. I have a 5X10 unit and the unit I moved from in San Francisco was a 4X5 via U-Haul. The 5X10 is nearly $30 cheaper, now that's a win.. win.

I will be referring other's to Extra Space Storage, for their storage needs in the future.</review>< Resp>

<review>I was a student looking for storage for the summer when I came across fliers advertising a discount introductory rate for All Aboard Mini Storage.  I decided to go with it because I would be saving $25 over a competing storage facility.  Do not be fooled by the discount.

I’m giving All Aboard Mini Storage a low rating because I ultimately ended up losing a lot more money than the discount saved and because their customer service was extremely bad compared with the previous storage facility I went with.

I was warned beforehand that I would have to give a 5-day notice before closing my storage space.  At the end of summer, I sent an email to them, giving my notification.  I received a personal confirmation from the manager that they had received my notification and that they appreciated doing business with me.  Two months later, I find that they were still charging me and now at full price.  When I contacted them about this mistake, they told me to refer back to the contract I had signed 5 months ago at section 7, where it stated that I would have to come in person to close my account.  At no point before that did they contact me about coming in to shut down the account and I was led to believe that the account had closed.  At no point did they apologise because they were afraid of liability if they did.

Basically, there is an expectation for YOU to follow up on closing your account, otherwise it is in their best interest to just keep charging without your knowledge.  I ended up wasting over $200 without my knowledge before I realised they were still charging me.  I did not get a refund despite the fact that I had nothing stored in the space for over two months.  I did not get an apology and instead was treated to a lecture about how I should always keep track of a contract during my summer vacation.  Students should stay away.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I needed some extra storage for a short period of time, and really hesitated to think of a storage unit b/c of previous experiences and expected high cost. I bit the bullet and went to Extra Storage (which used to be All Aboard, and I didn't have a good experience w/ All Aboard) since it's near my home.  I found Felix Moya to be extremely helpful, quick with information and options, and over all very accommodating to my needs.  I had the unit booked and items in the unit in less than an hour, at a price that was so much less than I expected. They had many offers and specials and it really fit my nees. I was very impressed with the appearance and cleanliness of the facility; it really felt like it was very new, but it has been there forever, and not been renovated (units).  Felix takes his job seriously, and manages the facility very well. I feel confident that my possessions are safe, and that access to the facility will be consistent and painless.</text>
