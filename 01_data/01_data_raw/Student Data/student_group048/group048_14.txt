<review>Prices are  higher but it's expected considering the location in the Foothills. However, the staff is friendly, and, helpful, they have a variety of items from fresh fruits, and, veggies, to meats, frozen foods/desserts, other edibles, hot foods,  household goods, a gas station, etc. They even have specialty items that I can't even find at stores like Raleys, or, Walmart anymore! Better selection than the old Gold Eagle in Brownsville had before they burnt down.
If you can't get to the larger towns, or, don't want to make the long drive, this is the place to go! Highly recommended!<//review><user>108563848215867316058<//user><GmapID>0x809ca0197ae25289:0x37d7ad4fb8aa00bd</GmapID>< rating>

Love the employees, always so friendly and helpful. Love that they always have some awesome coca cola classic of course. But most importantly, the patrons that visit this store are some of the nicest folks.
The nice man behind me in line saw me walking home from the store and gave me a ride home. He doesn't know me for nothing and i was a hot sweaty mess... but out of the kindness that seems to be lacking in our society, he pulled over and drove me back to my spot.
Without spreading your name thank you kind sir... you save me from a long walk!
I am grateful and will be pay it forward once i get my truck working!
Love this town!< /review>

<text>Physically it is limited in space, but it caters to the Fellowship of Friends group of mostly foreigners with many of their products. It does have pretty much of what I need, though, when I go there, and is the most convenient store to my residence. They also have gas and diesel, which is very beneficial for all of us in the area since the other options are driving to Brownsville 8-10 miles away or to the 76 station at the highway 20 junction; another 13 miles away.. The people/workers are very friendly there, which I appreciate. It is also a place to gather, which in rural communities like ours is a plus. You can sit in the deli with your laptop and use their internet.< /text><rating>3< /rating>< gmap_id>

<text>Oregon House Grocery store needs to expand the store, it's to small & crowded. If they expand they would really be great, they have a good start on things the customers want and need.  For all the thousands that live up here now and all the vacationers there's so much more that's needed so people don't have to go down to the valley to shop, everyone would love it.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I shop at the Oregon House Grocery Store almost on a daily basis. Living in the foothills you dont have alot of options. The prices are somewhat on the high side. The store also offers regular gasoline as well as diesal gas. They are open in the winter months from  7 am to 8pm. You can also get propane and cash in your recyclables.</Text>

I was so disappointed with the Staff here, so much so that I won't do any further business there, ever. The store is over priced and grungy. The employees were rude, disrespectful, unhelpful and showed serious attitude with me but were very nice to locals, making me feel unwelcome. I will travel 20+ miles to take my business else where, and I will never reccomend them to anyone Ever. Negative stars.</text>

They are supposed to be a full service store, it's 5:15 and they aren't taking recycle which is a California law for them Todo and also they haven't had air in over a month. The service here continues to get worse. It would be nice if the owner didn't have a monopoly on all the grocery stores within a 10 mile radius of me.  Poor service, I wouldn't recommend going here and the management(joanie Coleman) ,  druggies and pieces of garbage</review>

When you're thirty miles from Marysville and want or need an item most foothills stores won't carry Oregon House Store has it! Sure the prices are higher but when we needed green onions this place had them. They have gas too if you screwed up and didn't get filled up in the valley!</text>

<Text>Great, great customer service. Once i walked in I was greeted with respect and great attitude from the employees and the owner showed how much his customers matter. There meat department is to die for. They sell nothing but QUALITY meat. They have these meat platters that are very delicious. I definitely recommend this place. I have told my piers about this place and thet are very satisfied with the quality products. Please try them and you sill be very happy. It’s like a little Mexican store. I LOVE IT!</Text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) This butcher shop has the best meat in the county! I bought in several butcher shops and no one meets the quality of My Little Town. The trays are well prepared with good seasoning. The store is well stocked with groceries and takeout. I am always treated with good service and kindness.

I needed to get my brakes done for a cross country drive. I was visiting from Florida. My mom has used this mechanic for years and is the only one she trusts to work on her vehicles. I bring my truck in for inspection and I needed both front and back brakes done. They were able to complete the repair the same day. And it was right before Christmas Eve. I am so pleased with the work they did. And my ride back to Florida was safe and smooth. Highly recommend this shop.<//Review>

<text>CHAPMAN AUTO REPAIR OF ORANGE is the name to remember whenever you need any kind of work done to your car.  Believe it or not, their company’s slogan is “Thank you for calling the HAPPIEST place on earth, how can we help you today?”  At first I thought to myself that an Auto Repair place is like any other places and how can the company got Voted as the BEST of ORANGE for customer’s service and also Guarantee all of their repairs on PARTS and LABORS for LIFE.   Is that possible?  Is there such a place????

I then venture out to really find out if this place is real or are they just another advertisement scam like we all have seen, used to, and accustomed to receiving when it comes to dealing with auto repair companies.  After the worst possible experience I had with Lexus of Westminster, I have decided to give Chapman Auto Repair of Orange a try.  I found them online like most of us and believe me if you googled the company’s name you will be at ease after reading all the good comments left of this company.

From the first time talking to them until I left with my car LS 460 Lexus, I felt relieved for bringing my car here and to give them a try.  My Lexus needs a new starter and Lexus of Westminster quoted me the price of little over $2,200.00 to fix including the Diagnosis fees of $189.00 just to find out what the actual problem.  It took them 4 days later from the day of leaving my car to receiving a call back from them informing me my starter is the problem.  After the consultant Lance quoted me of the price $2,200 to fix the starter I confirmed with him once again about the warranty for their work and I was told of 12 months warranty on parts and labor and this is for replacing a “RE-MANUFACTURER” starter, not a brand new one.  I guess after 12 months and if the starter decided not to work again I will be out of another $2,200 for another starter.

With Chapman Auto Repair of Orange, the business is owned by John Pascal.  It is a family owned business and almost everyone who lives in Orange County knows who they are not because they are a big operator in the Auto Repairs space but most people know them through referral of friends, coworkers, or family members.  Don’t be fooled by taking your vehicle to the dealers as I thought my car will be safe with them when I pay higher prices.  This misconception is so wrong especially with Lexus of Westminster where their quoted prices of $2,200 to replace a starter, I got the exact same service from Chapman Auto Repair of Orange for $1,326.00 with LIFETIME WARRANTY ON PARTS & LABORS.  Yes, you heard that right, my starter is warrantied for life on parts and labors so I never have to replace another starter again.

John’s company also paid to have my car detailed all of inside, washed on the outside plus as complimentary he gave me a free oil change just to give them a try.  Now I am hook with their services and if I have to add up all of their combined services the cost of replacing my starter with them will be around $1,200.00 not counting the LIFETIME WARRANTY ON PARTS AND LABOR.  In many cases you have to pay extra for this type of insurance but with John’s company he told me that he uses great quality parts therefore he doesn’t mind giving lifetime warranty for the peace of mind to all of his customers.

What really melt my heart and felt warm about John and his staffs (Wesley, Joseph Robles, and Alan) is while I was there waiting for my car to be worked on, a homeless person walked in and was extremely apologetic by asking John if he could use the bathroom and not only John graciously agreed but also ask that the homeless person take with him some popcorn and a bottle of water with him after.  John did it with a smile instead of pushing him away.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank John Pascal (the owner), Joseph and Alan who helped signed me in, and Wesley who drove me to get a car rental while my car was worked on.

By proving this story is true I wanted to give my name and Michael T. Diep.  I am the inventor of Emery Cat Board.<//text>< GmapID>

Very helpful. They Were flexible with me and communicated quickly even when I messaged through the yelp app. My Prius was serviced and back to me in a prompt and timely manner, running great with new brakes and pads, a new oil pan plug and spark plugs.</Review>

Today was the first time I had been to Chapman Auto Repair, and I must say I am so impressed with every bit of my experience.

From making the appointment, safely checking my vehicle (COVID SAFE), and then sending me a detailed report along with photos and video of my vehicle showing me all the ins and outs that need my attention and in the severity in which they do, the entire experience was great!

I found this report to be so incredible helpful as I am not a mechanic, and seeing the items right there, along with photo and video documentation of the problems... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

After reading over the itemized and detailed examination report, I called the office and got a warm greeting, and an honest and fair price for the work I needed done.

I have never had such a pleasant experience like this with any mechanic, auto repair shop or repair service before!

Everyone that I spoke with was so polite, and professional.
I highly recommend Chapman Auto Repair to anyone that has any problems with their vehicles!!</text>

I have been looking for a full service mechanic because the place I was going to let me down. After a bit of research, I found Chapman Auto of Orange.

For the record: I have Not had any work done, yet. I have been having some issues with my Acura and decided it was time for the professionals to take a look.

First Impressions:

Everyone is super nice. I filled out a request for an appointment at 10:30 PM and by 8:45 AM Alan had given me a call. I told him about my issues and that I was waiting for a tow. The truck had already been ordered, so no point deduction for not telling me about the free service (I also have roadside assistance, so my tow was the cost of a tip). The Full Diagnostic Fee was a bit higher than I would have liked, but acceptable. It is a nice place and things cost money. I was initially greeted by Wesley, who asked if I would be needing a ride home. They have a free shuttle, awesome. While waiting, the owner, John, came up and introduced himself. On the free shuttle ride home, I was told that they also have loaner cars, if I end up having the repairs done. So far, so good.<//Text>

In a bustling city, where commuting is a necessity and car-related issues are bound to arise, it's reassuring to know that you can find a reliable automotive expert located right at the heart of LA. Thank you to Vic and his team at Hovson for the quality work and customer service I received last week. Something as minor as having the headlights replaced on my vehicle is a complicated task since it requires removal of the whole front bumper. I was so impressed with how efficiently and cost-effectively Vic completed the work! Not only did he fix what was needed, he went the extra mile and performed a quality check on ALL of the lights on my vehicle, front and rear, and detected one of the signal lights was out as well...something I didn't even notice. So grateful for the professional care I received at Hovson!< /Text>

BUYER BEWARE!!!

I took my truck a week ago to Chapman Auto Repair of Orange for an oil change and to replace a serpentine belt. My truck was not leaking oil and the repair shop said my oil pan was leaking oil and they recommended I change the oil pan gasket. I declined this repair and a few days after coming home it began leaking oil in my driveway. I got underneath and noticed that the drain bolt to the oil pan was loose and was leaking oil from that spot. These guys are Crooks and I believe they purposely left the drain bolt loose so it could leak oil.<//review>

<text>This shop has given us great service in the past at much better prices than a dealership. They are nice, professional, courteous and treat people well, but they recently diagnoseds a part as bad that I just had replaced 6 months earlier and charged $120.
I'll take the car back to the place that replaced the part and see what they say. If it turns out to be a bad or defective part, I'll amend this review to add more stars.</text><user_id>102427876013928264233< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

My roommate Lynden John took his '94 Nissan truck in for an engine replacement. Bout 5 or 6 G. Problems with new engine so they claimed defective parts and charged him to replace. Blew up radiator while testing engine. Coolant probably damaged engine. After several hours with new radiator, IT leakes out all over. Couldn't find where they moved the transmission stick. Took 3 of their mechanics 25 minutes to find it. Last time that truck left their lot the check engine light came on after 30 minutes!! They will charge you for THEIR mistakes which is quite often. After $12,000.00 for a $6,000.00 engine, THEY can pay their finance company the remaining $2,000.00. Got all paperwork to back it up. All this within 2 years. Never go there!!< /text></record>

I won't go into details, but I have a couple of cars fixed by these guys.  They are nice guys no doubt, but like other people have said they replace so much stuff that does not need to be replaced and charge ALOT of money for it.  And who knows if they actually fix the original problem.  I recently had my entire power steering system fixed (over $1000) by them a couple months ago and now its out...great work guys! Go somewhere else for sure!<//Review>

<Text>This was my first time going to Chapman Auto Repair. They were recommended to me so I decided to take my care there for an oil change. The experience was great. The staff is amazingly friendly and professional. I was assisted by Rene, both over the phone and in person. He was great to work with. The waiting area is clean and inviting. I look forward to paying them another visit when the time comes for my car's next oil change. Keep up the great work and service.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dcd9d950575d03:0xe40b668282e66356< /gmap_id>< Rate>

Too bad I can't give 0 stars. Let me start by saying they are either Ignorant or just crooks. I took my truck in for a squeak from the belt. After they did the "full inspection" they gave me an estimate for over 5 grand. Since it was there, I said ok to 2 of the lesser priced items. The squeak came back, Took it back and was told it could be the rockers and might have to do "exploratory surgery". God only know how much they would have charged. Took it somewhere else & it was a water pump leaking onto the belt. New gasket was all that was needed. Their costs are about double of what they should be. Please go somewhere else.</Text>

Posted a poor review after my first experience below.

Owner contacted me and Alan and team repaired the leak and stood behind their work.

I appreciate the service and will again come back.   I can not modify the previous review so I am creating another.

I have bringing in my Jeep Cherokee in since 2010 and always had great service. I drive from Oklahoma City to California to have my car serviced by Chapman Car Care. They have never told me of unnecessary work needing to be done.  Their shuttle service works great! Their work is guaranteed. I have received consistent reliable service. I have had no major problems since I have been taking my Jeep to Chapman Car Care. Knowing my car is in good hands is a great comfort. Thanks Guys!</review>

Very happy I found Chapman Auto Repair!  Efficient, on time with my appointment.  Staff very friendly and made me feel comfortable.  Clean, comfortable waiting room - with popcorn!  I went for a smog check, but I was so impressed I will bring all my future auto repair needs to Chapman Auto Repair.

My second visit to Chapman yesterday for oil change.  They caught a broken motor mount which I also had replaced.  When I picked my car up it was cleaned inside and out - even the tires were gleaming!  Love this place!< /Text>

I am a small Car Dealership in the area, and was looking for a good, knowledgeable mechanic, with reasonable prices. I was tired of going with the super cheap mechanic and having to fix things more than once, and costing me more in the long run. I read a lot of positive reviews for Chapman Auto Repair, and decided to give them a try. Before I took my first vehicle to them, I took it to Mazda for a diagnostic. I then took it to both mechanics I normally work with. They both gave me different recommendations (both were wrong). I then took it to Chapman Auto Repair who gave me the exact same diagnostic that Mazda did - at a fraction of the price. Not super cheap, but accurate, which is extremely valuable to my business.<//Review><Name>Trend Motorsports< /Name><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

<rating>1</rating><Text>They will get you to pay for something. They changed my oil before I called them back to give them the go ahead. I told him let me speak to my business partner and I'll call you back. I called back and said we don't need it and he claimed they were half way through the oil change even though the truck wasn't ready for 3 more hours. (How was he already in the middle of changing my oil??)
Now it gets better. I call the dealer I purchased the truck from telling him I just paid 200 dollars for an oil change and wasn't happy that he sold me a truck that had just recently been serviced. He informed me he has documentation And it was just done 2 weeks ago! Chapman said it was low and needed changing. They just wanted to charge me 230 dollars for a miss diagnosis and an oil change I never needed.
The dealer told me any honest machanic would have seen the oil filter was brand new and didn't need replacing. The guys at Chapman come across like really nice guys but at the end of the day they are very tricky sales men. I will also contact Better Business Bureau as well.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Another wonderful  experience at Chapman Auto Repair.  My air conditioner broke so popped in without an appointment.  They couldn't have made it easier.  From the knowledgeable, courteous Customer Service Reps, the ride to the car rental and updates throughout the day.  Oh yea, and they even took it to get washed before I picked it up.  Less expensive than the dealer, quality work and SO much easier!<//review><GmapID>0x80dcd9d950575d03:0xe40b668282e66356</GmapID>< pics>

Only once before have I found a mechanic that I can trust like Chapman Car Care. That mechanic retired years ago.

We've had a number of opportunities to use them and they have always been fair and honest. They also have incredible customer service.

I would refer anybody to these folks.

Don't look at the negative reviews posted here. They have absolutely nothing to do with their service and competency.</Review>

< review>
My daughter, an 18-year old new driver, is going to college 2 hours from me and doesn't know the area well. Her truck died and she needed immediate assistance at 2pm on a Friday. I searched the internet and found great reviews for Chapman Car Care, so I gave it a shot.  1) they had it towed and tow company was there within 5 minutes (no joke!) 2) they had great customer service over the phone and in the shop.  They answered all my questions, kept my daughter and more importantly me up-to-date on their findings via phone. It took a couple of hours to find out the cause, but in the meantime, they shuttled my daughter to get food. I thought the price was reasonable for what it was (electrical). They took my card over the phone without a hassle all while sending my daughter on her way.  I can't tell you how much they helped with my anxiety and was very pleased with their service.  We will be using them in the future!  I will be recommending them to others! Thank you Chapman Car Care (especially Bob!)  :)< /review>

<Text>As a female with not a lot of knowledge when it comes to cars, I was already feeling unsure about going into a new "Auto Repair Shop".  I thought to myself however, no matter what, you will eventually need to get some repairs done and the dealership will always be much higher in cost than a family-owned business. So I went ahead and scheduled an appointment with Chapman Auto Repair.

As soon as I walked in, I was completely impressed by not only the cleanliness of the facility, there were snacks, waters in a fridge and I was greeted with the most positive attitude -- it felt so genuine!  It wasn't just one staff member, I was greeted by 3-4 including some of the mechanics that were coming in and out of the main office.  I immediately felt at ease and welcomed.

Fortunately for me, I work right down the street so I was able to drop my car off at lunch, and get a ride to work and back to Chapman Auto Repair with the free shuttle service!

I returned to Chapman Auto Repair to see a list of items that my car would need to run smoother.  Even though I was budgeted for a few of those expenses, Chapman Auto Repair did not push me, they did not "sell me", they did set me up with a priority plan to fulfill all the line items over time and feeling confident that my car will run as smooth as it's able.  It felt like it was a family friend genuinely trying to help me get my car up-to-par.

Overall, my experience was very pleasant.  I was so pleased that I went back for a follow-up maintenance service several months later when it was time.  At that point, I was able to expense another line item on the plan.

I would highly recommend to anyone who needs work done for their car.  Chapman Auto Repair is warm, family-friendly, positive, they remember your name, and ultimately they look out for YOU and your car!  Thank you Chapman Auto Repair!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We tried to visit here to get an alignment for our car after getting new tires.  We were told they are too busy and they asked us to set an appointment.  They offered a specific time 2 days later. We paid for the expected service and left.  Came back at the time they asked and they said they are too busy to do the work.  Perhaps we could come back another day.   WHAT?  And what would happen then?  They would look to see IF they could do it at that time. So what good is an appointment.  They said they only have one lift and they have always have a waiting list of cars that need it.   I asked for a refund of the money.  They refused.   So I had no choice but to file a fraud report with our credit card company who will charge them back and credit us that way.

Can not recommend this place.  They intentionally lie about appointment times and refuse to honor their own promises.  We ended up visiting Big-O to get the work done and they did it immediatly and at a cheaper price than Chapman wanted even after using their $40 off coupon we got from America's Tire.

--Additional info, next day--
The same representative that we dealt with at the time saw our review and called us on the phone to argue his point.    Having the employee involved call the customer to continue the argument is not a very good thing to do.

In their favor, a person identifying himself as the owner reached out to us and expressed regret at what transpired and assured us this is not what they want to see happen.  He offered to refund the amount immediately, something his employee would not do.   We returned the next day and received a check for the refund, but not until the employee from yesterday made a snide remark asking if we are going to remove the negative review.  He was told that we will edit the review adding this resolution.  Holding the check while asking that question and awaiting a reply felt like he was debating not giving us the check unless we agreed to remove the negative review.

In the end, We have upped the star rating from 1 to 3 based ONLY on the owners quick and appropriate response.</review>

Excellent work! 5-stars all the way. I have a good car, but it needed work. LOTS of work, as luck would have it. I brought the car in late on a Friday. By 5pm the next day, Saturday, my car was fixed up perfect...except for one thing. Turns out I needed something adjusted. I brought it back just before closing, and not long after they took care of everything. I'm very happy with the service, and happier to know that there's an honest group of mechanics in town.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Chapman Auto is run the way a business ought to be run!  They always put the best interest of the customer at the forefront of everything that they do.  They also conduct themselves professionally and very courteously.  The product that they turn out, automotive repair, is done with the highest of standards and quality.  They do not charge a high price and do poor work or install low grade parts, they use only the best of parts.  I trust this shop to do the work they say they'll do.  Over the last 15  years that I've used auto dealers, I have figured out that many dealers often bill unneccessary work that they sometimes don't even do.  Chapman does what they say they will do.  It is just very nice to have a shop like this to work with!  This is the old way American business used to be and a great example for businesses today...< /Review>< Pics>

Took my car in for a safety inspection and was very pleased with the way my car was checked and the way I was treated. They dropped me off at a local Mall while my car was being checked, and picked me up when the inspection was completed. They washed my car and made sure I was happy with the results of their work.
I found John and Chris to be very cordial and informative about matters relating to my car and it's performance...thumb's up to these guys...

There is a 1st for everything and I can honestly say I trust Chapman Auto Repair in Orange.  A trustworthy auto repair location is hard to find and with a aging car I'm excited to find a business that doesn't need to know my banking balance to do a repair or diagnosis on my car.  Thank you<//Text>

<text>Chapman Auto Repair has satisfactorily performed repairs on two of my cars (Ford and Lexus) for reasonable costs (defined by independent internet sources).  A valve cover gasket replacement was performed by an experienced mechanic for close to half of the Dealer Quote.  The customer interaction is very good and the staff's depth of experience and certification seems to be excellent. The work is performed promptly.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

John, Ken, Bob, Wes and the team at Chapman are awesome.  I've been taking my cars here for about 10yrs and I've always received fair, reasonable, honest car repair and maintenance with a smile.  Their customer service is excellent - they really are super nice guys.  I recommend them to friends and family all the time.</review>

<Text>Let me quickly set the scene. Me, my wife, and 2-year-old daughter take a spontaneous Saturday trip to Disneyland, leaving from Las Vegas. We don't pack a thing and head out. After a wonderful day, we see fireworks, gas up, and head home. With 5 lanes of dense traffic backed up for miles on the 91, my clutch goes out, and things get bad. I call several toe truck companies before one says, "Hey man, you need to call 911, like now." CHP arrives, shutting down the highway, and uses their car to push mine to the side. An interesting tow truck driver and a Best Western later, I drop my car off at Chapman's gate.

Now it's Sunday, and Chapman's is closed. I reach out the owner on Yelp, and he responds right away, saying, "I will get you taken care of first thing Monday morning." After another day at Disneyland, and another hotel room, I get to Chapman's bright and early.

I talk to Joe, who says he will check things out and see what we can do. I can tell Joe is a compassionate man who actually cares about getting my family home. Unfortunately, it's not a simple fix. It's going to take an entire clutch replacement which is usually a day and a half job. Joe hustles up and calls around for all the parts and luckily is able to find them. He says he will get me out the same day. A major relief.

Fun fact, Lyft and Uber, don't have car seats anywhere other than New York. We spend the day walking the streets of Orange and catch a movie. At 4pm, Joe calls to let me know they are buttoning things up and I should head down. We sit around a while and meet another interesting character, Frank, who keeps things light and lively while we wait.

Unfortunately, one of the parts is bad out of the box. We will have to stay another night. Frank offers to pay for our room and says they will get the part first thing in the morning. Best case scenario we are on the road by 10am, worst case, 3pm. I appreciate the blunt honesty throughout.

At 8am the next day, I get a call saying my car is ready to go. Joe and James, spent the entire night, until 9pm, taking my car back apart so they could get things done early in the morning and get my family on the road. It was James birthday to boot, and he spent it at work, helping me. That's the real deal. I won't forget it.

Big thanks to Joe, James, and Frank for taking care of me and going the extra mile. After four days in the same clothes and 15+ miles pushing a stroller around the streets of Orange, finally getting home is an indescribable feeling that I still may not have if it wasn't for these men.< /Text>< username>

I came in as a walk in for a smog check and i was glad I choose this shop. I was taken care of by Alan who was extremely helpful and courtesy. In a matter of minutes my vehicle was being inspected. Also I was with my 6 year old daughter and as soon as the team seen here they were filling up a balloon. Needless to say she was happy with that. The icing on the cake was when Alan handed me a voucher for a free car wash, now that made my day. All in all I had a great experience and would recommend this shop to anyone who is looking to get their business done right and in a flash.</review>

<review>Even though they paid him back, I'm suspicious of a company that would over charge intentionally to begin with.

Chad from Anaheim wrote this on Yelp

After dropping my vehicle off for ignition issues, I researched in my records and found we had never replaced spark plugs. I asked the technician how the plugs looked and their response was "they look like new, I would not recommend to replace them."

I paid for them to diagnose the issue. They quoted 2 things that even the manufacturer agrees was not needed,

I went home, pulled the plugs and found them to be in horrible condition. After replacing them myself, the $1,900 repair estimate turned into a $60 resolution. Everything was fixed, the check engine light turned off, and now I do not trust these guys. For the note, it has been over a month and the engine has not ran rough even once since, which was regularly occurring when it was taken into the shop.

I even reached out to the GM to give him the opportunity to make it right for us, I even dropped off the spark plugs, and haven't had any communication since, despite a couple professional follow-up messages. Very sad as I once thought highly of their service, but the real test is always when there is a problem and in how they take that opportunity to recover from the situation. There was no recovery attempt with me and as such I will not return and take the risk of another poor service opportunity and a potential rip-off attempt.< /review><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

Courteous and friendly service is expected at any business and was received at Chapman Auto Repair. A bit reluctant, I called first and came in on a Saturday without an appointment. I had an oil leak and was very concerned about the issue and how much it was going to cost. My car is less than 5 years old and I hoped it was nothing serious. It was repaired by the end of the day and with the first time customer discount,  diagnostic included,it was reasonable. Timely repairs,  a reasonable price, courteous service, free shuttle, and issue resolved. This made my day.< /text>

When my car experienced problems while on the freeway, my insurance company arranged for towing to Chapman Auto Repair, which they recommended. The entire staff was cordial and professional from the first minute. Literally within a few minutes, the problem was identified and I was being shown the parts and printouts of my options. They assisted me with a car for the duration of the repair. I received updates on the progress, and the estimated time of completion was entirely accurate. I had a great experience with this shop, and will not hesitate to take my car repair needs there in the future.</text>

I've been exclusively servicing my vehicles here for approximately 7 years and have always received great care.  John the owner is an upstanding guy who takes customer service and satisfaction very seriously.  In all my years of service I've only experienced one hiccup and that was resolved with the utmost care and professionalism and for that I'm very grateful.  There have been many times when I've been told that a repair is not warranted and have been able to save money on repairs.  In all, I've been pleased with the level of service that I've received and truly feel that they've kept us safely on the road.  One of the best things for me has been their willingness to pick-up or drop-off not just me but my car, as single person, that service in itself is fantastic.  They have even picked my car up from my job and repaired it while I've worked!  I HIGHLY recommend this shop!<//text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>BEWARE. Behind the smiles and kindness this shop is: Expensive, untrustworthy, & cause more harm than they fix. My car required about $600 in break fixes, but they attempted to quote me $5000 in work on a car that is barely worth more than that. Taking it to the dealer would have been cheaper, and upon calling around they were roughly 4x the cost of any other place. They reinstalled my tires with a pinched nozzle which left me stranded one day the following week with a flat tire. The window washer fluid spray has not worked ever since my visit, and refilling the fluid does not help. Even obvious oversights like replacing the emblem on the wheel or replacing each of the air stem caps on my tires they neglected to do, which scares me to think about what they forget to do under the hood and out of sight.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I called Chapman Auto Repair to ask what made them qualify for "Voted Best Auto Repair Orange County" I was told that this was compiled data from Yelp and Google reviews. I asked if they were given an award or merit for this achievement. The answer was no that this is something they decide on their own. I then said through my research Chapman Auto Care had low scores on Yelp and several lower than average reviews on Google. It was further explained that their achievement was "OLD DATA" So how can a company decide that they are voted best in the county when they clearly are not. I was told to hold and never got an answer while waiting over 25 minutes. I guess they thought I would just go away. If a company has to lie to bring in business, what does that say about them as a reputable company.</Text>< gmap_id>

Excellent experience. I came to Chapman Care Care to get a second opinion, and ended up getting the work done there. They were very quick, open and communicative. I loved the diagnostic report they provided, with photos and explanations of what was wrong and what needed to be done. They provided me with a list of items that were urgent, and a second list of items that could wait. The prices seemed reasonable, and I really appreciated the free shuttle to and from the shop while they had my car. I'll be going back next time I need to get some work done.< /review>

I was looking for an alternative to the Jeep dealership in Tustin, and found this place! I'm glad I found them, and will continue taking my Jeep there for tuneups and service. Joe, the manager, was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend them to any fellow student, or anyone for that matter. You won't get ripped off, and they won't treat you disrespectfully.<//Review>

There is no high pressure like, "You need ths" or You need that, etc, etc.  You tell them what the car needs in repair, and they will fix it, and do it right.  Prices are very fair, and reasonable, much better than a dealer.  Try them once and you will not go anywhere else.  I really appreciate their honesty and fairness.  This is a good place to take your car.<//review>< GmapID>

I work in town and got off at 7am. These guys were open so I gave them a call about getting a smog check. The tech was coming in at 8am. Super friendly on the phone and when I showed up, EVERYONE greeted me with a friendly smile. As other customers were coming in, they received the same friendly hello. The lobby has WiFi if you need it and coffee was available. And, the place was very clean and comfortable. I wish them continuing success and I know they'll be around for many more years to come because of the formula they're following. Thanks again guys!!!</review>

Just had my car worked on at this shop. They absolutely knocked it out of the ballpark! I just had a minor job done and even though I spent 1/10th of what I have spent at other shops, Chapman Auto Repair and the staff totally made me feel like a VIP.

From the way the answer their phone (First impressions DO make a huge difference) to the time you leave, they are courteous, professional and friendly.

The value I received was by far greater than the money I spent. That is not something I often say when I have my car worked on.

Kudos in particular to Joseph who was my service advisor, and John- the big Kahuna, whom I also spoke with for making this a great experience at the auto repair shop. I will definitely be coming to you in the future for my auto repair needs.<//text>

My first time here was a very pleasant experience. I had seen the shop many times but had never stopped in.  I had a coupon for an oil change and thought I'd give it a try. I also got a smog check and my tires rotated. They were very accommodating in getting me in and out as soon as possible. The recommendations that were made were logical per my maintenance schedule and the mileage of my vehicle I found their pricing comparable to the dealership that I usually use.  However, this place is much more convenient for me, as I commute by train just down the street. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and I felt well taken care of.  I will definitely be coming back!<//text>

We were in Anaheim for a family vacation to Disneyland when our Suburban started making a strange noise. I found Chapman auto online and took a chance. They were wonderful. They were extremely friendly,  repaired my car in a timely fashion, and shuttled me back to the Disneyland front gate. Chapman auto turned what could have been a disaster into a non issue. Thank you so much for your kind, efficient service!

<review>Great service, very friendly but the real important thing is price and quality.  They have that too.  They say that they are friendly and they are friendly.  I did have a problem with the repair and they took care of it, no questions asked.  You really know someone is good when you have problems and you still want to come back.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

If I could give zero stars i would
Please be aware --- be very aware
My car was towed, they checked it out and I was told the following"
I need to replace: water pump, thermostat, radiator hose top and bottom, and a belt = $1,600. I told them no deal and picked up my car. Took my car to my regular mechanic and I was told the following:
"That place is a rip off. The only thing you needed is a new clamp as the one on the radiator hose is defective". The clamp was replaced and my car has been fine ever since - in Total I spent $0.00. No, my mechanic does not believe in patch work. I use my car for work, so whatever I need to pay to have it repaired ....I would pa.

I will be honest, after their quote, i was worried that I would need to come out of pocket for at least $1,000 once i took it to my mechanic

I took my car there as it was recommended, but I was told, "they are expensive". The night before as I was driving home, I noticed that my engine warning light was on and the thermostat needle was reading hot. The car did not overheat. I also heard some squeaking and screeching which indicated a belt was wet. the belt can only be wet from a leak. However,  I did not notice any leakage. My radiator reservoir had no antifreeze and it took 3.5 bottles of arrowhead water. Definitely, something was wrong, but with my limited knowledge about auto repair - I figured, i would leave it to the experts. Not knowing that the experts were expert ripoffs.

They give you a line of credit (that's how they get you). I'm not foolish, I priced all the parts they listed - $650 which means $950 was labor costs.

I informed the person that recommended me , and trust after she pays what she owes.... she will never return. I won't ever go to them again, nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.

They didn't count on me knowing as much as I know about my car. I have been driving the same model car for 18 years (not the same car) and within that time I have gained some knowledge.

The only plus, since I dropped my friend's name , they did not charge me 89.99 to inspect the problem. LOL --- most likely because they knew that i would be back starting trouble to get a refund for misleading me and wanting me to give them $1,600 in exchange for a hose clamp.

I'm waiting for them to read this review and contact me so I can give them $1,600 worth of curse words.

Know your car, don;t be desperate, give AAA plus so you can tow your car past 7 miles. AAA is $75 for the year and you can tow up to 100 miles  --- well worth it !

Beware .... Be very Aware... DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR THERE.... you have been warned. If you gon there and get ripped off ...you cannot say," I didn't know".

The "good reviews" are from people who didn't know any better. Their car was repaired because they were desperate and figured what they paid was a good deal.

You tell me ...who got the better deal....
$1,600 would have put my car back on the road, but so did a clamp that cost a buck and change. All the parts  that they requested to be repaired were in good working condition...considering I replaced the radiator one year ago, and my engine was replaced 45 days ago. So, if there were any issues my mechanic would have caught it.  In my model car, everything is so cramped that in order to get to the defective part, the surrounding parts require removal.

Please whenever anyone replaces parts on your car --- Be sure to get the old parts back as that is one indication that at least the part was changed out and not patched up and put back in.  That includes oil filters. Some mechanics will rise off the filter to get all the dust and dirty off then put in the same filter, although you were charged for a new one.

Take heed and scroll down to read a review from  2 months ago and another from 7 months ago - they both said the same thing as i just said about being over-priced and not needing to change out working parts .<//Text>

I am not from here, so I had no idea where to go to get my a/c looked at since it was going out.  I took my car in and they took me back in a hummer shuttle to my house, called me and updated me on everything that was going on, shuttled me back the next day and the a/c blew better than it had in a long time!

Bottom line : Great people and service!

For all of your car needs, Chapman auto care is the place to go!< /Text>

My customer experience was so exceptional that I decided to write a review for the 1st time ever. The before and after performance of my vehicle was extraordinary. At the end, they gave me paperwork that explained the kind of details that left every single possible question that I had answered. Whoever is reading this... I suggest you go to them, Bottom line.
P.S. there is a lot of other positive stuff I left out just because I’m lazy and I want to go to bed right now.<//Review>

<Review>If it were possible to give zero stars, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to give them that. The front office staff are super friendly when it comes to welcoming you, but the service is over priced. They told me that they were going to charge me a certain price over the phone, but once I arrived to pick up my car the price was $69 more than established. I was told I was going to be charged $2,618 but ended up paying $2,679 of who knows what, which was not clear on my receipt either. That's not the worst. When I went to pick up my car, they hadn't done what they said they were going to do. They were supposed to change a radiator hose and take out all the dirty antifreeze and oil residue that was in the system because it was muddy dirty. Once I received my car back they claimed to have done all the work and charged me for it. When I got home, I opened the hood of my car to check all that they had done. I checked all the fluids,  where the antifreeze goes was still the same brownish mud that initially I had taken my car for. So, I called them to ask about it and they told me to take my truck back and once I was there the technician told me that the car was going to be ok and I only needed to drive a little more. They claimed to have flushed the system twice, but it was clear they had not done so because it looked the exact same way before and after the "check." They started flushing the system again and they placed new antifreeze and the truck was finally ok, which means that they didn't do it and lied about it. That makes you wonder if they really perform the services that they charge you for. I would not recommend this place to anyone and if you decide to take your car there, you have to know about cars because they will take advantage of you.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I took my car in because I checked the level of my transmission fluid and it was over the MAXIMUM after a friend put transmission fluid in it. I ran my car in to Chapman Auto to fix the issue and I was charged $86. When I got home, I checked the level of my transmission fluid and it was still at the same level, over the MAXIMUM. They did not perform any service on my car. I was charged $86 for nothing.
Additionally, I had new brake pads put on, who knows if I even needed them, now the car doesn't stop without applying additional force to the break peddle.
On another occasion, I was overcharged and I was also quoted more than $350 for a $12 dollar seal that AA charges $90 for parts and labor. When I explained that AA only charges $90 the owner explained that his employee accidently hit the wrong button on the computer for the service. That's why they were going to charge me over $350 but, I caught them. When I asked for my bills to be reviewed for other overcharges the owner, John, became nasty. He admitted that they owed me a refund, but they would not refund me because I asked them to check all my past bills/charges.
I reported this to the Better Business Bureau, because none of us deserve to be scammed out of our hard earned dollars.
They really need a formal investigation for all the false repairs they have been charging for AND the fraud for telling people that their cars need repairs that they don't need.
This place is a scam. Look them up on yelp and you'll see other customers who CAUGHT them; giving false diagnosis, performing unauthorized repairs, overcharging and charging for services that your car doesn't need and/or that they did not even do.< /review>

They gave a reasonable estimate ($1100) and told me they could probably finish it by the end of the day,  give me a ride to work after I dropped it off and would pick me up again to pick it up. They also said if it was not completed they would give me a complimentary rental car. After a couple hours they call me and let me know I didn't need a clutch replacement, only a minor repair ($127). I know if I had gone to most places they would have charged me the other amount and not done the real work. I was impressed. Plus, my car was washed when I picked it up.

It is no coincidence that the Lion's Share of these reviews are mostly 4+ & 5 Stars~!  As it is our human nature to be more likely to complain about something than to praise a positive experience...you can take the negative & very few comments with a grain of salt.  Truth is that John & his mechanic are Class-A folks with a Class-A operation.</Text>

<review>These guys never test on obd scanner which would then show system  reset.need a retest.mistake on their part but still would play you out to pay retest said the machine ran twice,...really..?I realize now most place gives free retest . they got me twice.and worst part was that they act like its your fault. They act nice and deceived and get ya .Bussiness as usual.good luck to all , even with their coupon .most places is 29.99 pass or free retest.unlike some places I know.and most other place would happily retest pass or don't pay as advertise all over.lesson learned. I would never recommend this place .so much other reputable smog @ lower price without coupons anyway. Just google it.</review>< Pics>

My warranty expired on my car and I was very concerned about finding a repair shop that I felt would not take advantage of a woman who knows nothing about repairing an automobile. I had a bad noise coming from the front area of my car. I asked for a diagnosis and received an e-mail with pictures of the problem! The dealership never did that. Not only did they find out I needed brakes but found a really bad problem regarding oil leaking under the car that I had addressed with the dealership twice before my warrant ran out,(they never found it), but Chapman Auto Repair  took a picture of it to prove it.They said that it had been there a very long time. It would have been covered under my warranty! Everyone is so sincerely genuine here. I do believe that if I have any problems with my car they will be there for me. I didn't need to find transportation as they took me to work and picked me up when my car was repaired. Winner winner chicken dinner for sure!!!< /review>

If your older car breaks down on a weekend, don't have it towed to this facility.  My son's 2005 Jaguar X Type's water pumped seized and the pump drive belt broke.  I had the car towed to this facility because of the smiley faces and seemingly good reviews.

On Monday about noon Brien (that's how it's spelled!) texted me an estimate of a number of critical repairs that were urgently needed.  Of the eight items on the estimate not one of them was the seized water pump and broken belt!!!!!

So I called Brien and asked him about the original reason the car was brought in.  "Oh, the broken belt and seized water pump?"  Yes, can you give me an estimate for replacing the water pump, the water pump drive belt, and the serpentine belt? "I'll get right back to you"

$990.00 dollars for a water pump, water pump drive belt, and serpentine belt!!!  After a few minutes of blackness I came to and decided to come down to the shop and meet the crew..

Jaguar would have done it for a whole lot less.

This is not a difficult repair and I'm not a barefoot Pilgrim.  I decided not to do business with these people.  Now I was a bit surprised to receive a bill for $111.00 for the diagnostic estimate that they did on the car.  Biting the bullet because I had to have my car towed from the facility and I was feeling a bit exposed I paid the fee with my AMEX.  (I'm going to the BBB because I didn't ask for that diagnostic estimate)

I don't recall asking them to check my shocks or spark plugs.  I brought the car in with a seized water pump and broken belt.  That's just shady.

As to being friendly and perhaps the 'Happiest Place on Earth" these folks, including the new owner and his partner are smiling and very polite even when acknowledging that they are very expensive but they offer a 'lifetime' warranty and that's good value.

Such a shill.  Try and make good on that warranty if the car breaks down 50 miles from the shop.  Good luck.

So, my friends in Orange, don't fall for the bright paint and balloons, the kids dentist office toy box or the smiling faces of the happiest people on earth.

They're only happy when you're over a barrel and broke<//Review>

I met one of the techs at last years Octoberfest and now that i needed work on my car, i decided to give him a call. Just dropped off my car. The price to "lookk at my car" was a bit high, however it all gets applied to the work. I was offered a free drink and popcorn. they joked that free box wine and margaritas were available. I laughed, opened the fridge and, well... they actually had wine, hard lemonade, etc. Then because its already the end of the day, the got me a rental car, FREE OF CHARGE!!! How much better service can one expect?!</Text>

$900 + 2 weeks + a part I didn't need = nothing but Hot Air /// Some facts:  My A/C was 'pulsing' on and off (* cooling no more than 2-3 minutes at a time), incapable of bringing down the temp in my car cabin any further than near ambient (particularly during very hot days). I purchased a Groupon for an A/C system inspection and refill (if need be) at Chapman Auto Repair. After approx. 20 minutes, a member of the service team explained that he'd performed an A/C system leak check, charged the system with refrigerant "which was low" and insisted that a heating/cooling valve component needed to be replaced. 1 week later, I paid $850 (on top of the $50 Groupon), took receipt of my car and within the span of a weekend, my A/C began pulsing and then didn't work at all = nothing but hot air (* at any setting, having run 20+ minute tests on every possible setting with an outside temp of 100+F). I brought my car back, explained my concerns and Chapman agreed to take a look. Another week later, soon after speaking with a member of the Chapman front office - a conversation wherein it was suggested that I might not know what I'm talking about/there can't possibly be any merit to my claim (* I'm a university educated chemist, with a background in car tuning, construction, computer repair, new products development, woodworking...and chemistry), my car was delivered to me, idling, with the A/C on full and the lowest temperature setting, blowing nothing but HOT AIR!? Frustrated and told earlier that the team at Chapman felt certain that my car was repaired. I drove away, and drove straight to a mechanic with whom I worked with before. I cannot possibly state how surreal it was to receive my car in just as bad, if not worse, a condition as it was when I brought it in (2 weeks prior), with zero acknowledgment nor desire on the part of Chapman to get to the bottom of my cooling concerns. Note: I truly beg anyone at Chapman... I beg you to refute any of the above as being anything but the facts. At shop #2, the expert mechanic checked the A/C, explained to me that the refrigerant was near empyt, charged the system and performed a thorough leak check (including a UV light scan of any and all joints, junctions, known leak points throughtout the engine bay). Having found no sign of leaks whatsoever, he charged me $30 for the refrigerant and insisted that I drive the car for a week+ and report back. 3 weeks later, he checked the system again finding zero refrigerant lost, no leaks and the A/C working perfectly = comes on quickly (within seconds) and cools rapidly (despite the outside temp) aka. a fully functioning A/C. So what happened at Chapman? I'll honestly never know. Did they bother to fully charge the system? I can't say. Is their A/C diagnostic device broken? I have no idea. Was there a leak that somehow, miraculously repaired itself? It's unlikely. Did Chapman charge me $900 and deliver a car with an A/C system that inarguably didn't work (ex. hot air when delivered, empty refrigerant confirmed by second shop)? Yes, absolutely yes (and PLEASE Chapman, try to tell me I'm wrong. I would love to hear your input). P.S. I gave a tip to the second shop because of his absolute honesty, his desire to do right by his customers (he never once questioned my claims) and because his repair ACTUALLY WORKED - crazy, I know!< /review>

This nice guy shenanigans if ridiculous. Took my vehicle in, didn't diagnose problem for 5 days and called my other mechanic to get opinion, and told them it's a tranny issue that they can't do it. After the back and forth , found out it was a transmission control motor, which they wanted to charge over $1000 to do. They said they would have to refurbish my old one and it was going to be a lot because they don't make part for 1990 jeep anymore.long story short, I took it back to my good mechanic at Leons Transmission, and they found the part for my Jeep at half the cost. The part is 480 + labor. Alot different than Chapman car care, which wanted me to refurbish part since they couldn't find one, and charged twice the amount. I've worked on this jeep inside and out and was at a loss. But trust who your going to. These situations happen all the time.< /review>

<Text>The staff here are really friendly and I feel they are honest. It is not the cheapest place to get auto repairs done, but I don't mind paying more for the best customer service and for my car being ready when they say it will be. I haven't used their complimentary shuttle, but they have offered it to me, which is really kind. They mail me coupons that I use. Their labor and parts are under a very reasonable warranty too.

Out of the few times I have been here for service, my issues were fixed in an extremely timely manner; however I had to take my car back to them on three separate occasions due to bad parts that failed (a starter and a power steering pump), and for an adjustment one of the techs forgot to do (the engine was revving hard while I was parked).

I might have had a bit of bad luck these three times, and they did rush to get my car done, but I did have to mention it and dock a star because of these reasons. I am glad I live close and was able to take advantage of their warranty which they honored.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
When we decided to replace our aging sedan, we did a number of internet searches for vehicles that fit our wants - we found quite a few nice-looking options at the Deal Time dealership in Bakersfield.  The staff responded very quickly to our multiple email inquiries, and we set a time to visit and look at the vehicles we liked from their ads.

From the time we arrived, the salespeople were exceptional - they showed us all 4 of the vehicles we were interested in, took us on test drives, and discussed the options with us, all without any “pressure” to buy something.  In all, I think we dealt with 3 different sales people (Junior, Aldo, Alfonso if memory serves me) while we were checking out the different vehicles - one thing that amazed us was that each new salesperson we talked to knew what we were looking at, and where we were in the process (what we liked and what we didn’t).  It was great to have such a seamless transition between multiple different people!

When we decided on a specific SUV, the negotiation was effortless - the vehicle was priced right where Kelly Blue Book indicated, and we feel they gave us a more than fair offer on our trade-in.

Due to some time constraints, we had to leave the dealership before we could complete the transaction - but, that didn’t matter!  When we came back the next day, they had all the paperwork and our new SUV waiting for us, washed, cleaned, shiny, and ready to go.

Of course, we had our own mechanic go over the SUV.  Although it’s an older / classic model he told us it was in great shape, and didn’t identify any problems with it at all.

In all, we’re thrilled with the new car, and we’ve never had a more positive car buying experience - we’d highly recommend Deal Time to anyone looking for a new vehicle.

Thanks for such a great experience!

Today was my first time getting a car!! I had the greatest experience! I was assisted by Miguel, he was so amazing! He made every thing very simple for me. He even picked me up in my new car so I could get down to the lot for paper work because I was having a transportation issue. Everyone was so nice and very helpful. I’m happy I went to them !!!!</Review>

Me and my husband decided to buy a car today and Anthony helped us. We loved how enthusiastic and charismatic he was. The workers at Deal Time are the most friendly people and let’s not forget about their great deals. I 100% recommend everyone to get your vehicles from deal time!!<//Review>

What a great experience. Not your typical used car establishment. My son and I were extremely pleased with the service and knowledge of the staff. Jose and Anthony were both extremely professional and personable. The entire staff made the transaction process flawless and simple. Would definitely do business with them  in the future and would highly recommend.<//Text>

Nicho was Awesome, I was so satisfied with the service that I got at Deal Time. I wasn’t approved at the time of the deal, but he kept working and found a bank to approve me. Good people, and would definitely recommend them to family and friends.< /review>

The salesman who helped me was Nicho. Once we got there he helped us right away and offered a test drive. He was very friendly and made the experience easy and not too scary haha, since was my first time purchasing a car i was a bit nervous.

Called twice only to be transferred to a voicemail.  I guess this is what one needs to expect when dealing with "used car" sales people as opposed to new.  Nonetheless, disappointing customer service!

REVISED REVIEW:
Jess called me to apologize for me being transferred to voicemail.  He was so kind and genuine.  He was puzzled as well as to why I got voicemail.  I read people well and being in customer service, I knew immediately that he is not your typical car salesman.  He truly is sincere in everything he says.  The fact that he posted an apology AND called was quite impressive!  That is excellent customer service!  I really hope we will be able to purchase our car from Deal Time because of the great service thus far from Jess.  There really needs to be more sales people like him in all industries!

Thanks Jess for your sincere apologies and reaching out so quickly!  Deal Time is very fortunate and blessed to have you on their sales team!!</Text>

Bought a truck from them 1 month ago, after having it for a week the breaks started to get hard and would be super hard to stop, called them they "fixed" the problem. After 3 weeks of being "fixed" it messed up again and sense our 1 month warranty was up they would not cover it and told us to stop calling them to fix it and look in another direction. They never even fixed the problem in the first place!! The problem is that the vacuum pump is only 7% and it needs to be at least 25%. Peter sold us a broken truck and doesn't even care! They seem really nice at first until they scam you!! Definitely do not recommend to anyone!</text>< pictures>

He greeted me with a friendly smile showed me some cars and even let me test drive one (which if anyone is looking for a Camaro, their 2015 RS is a steal!!!).

I had a great experience with my car purchase. I had been to several other dealers in and out of town with lukewarm customer service. That was not the case at Deal Time. Julian Sr. took the time to listen to my needs and understand my situation. They found a car I love at a unbeatable price. Julian was there and followed up with me through the whole process. I strongly recommend Deal Time. Ask for Julian Sr. and get some real customer service.<//Review>

Our salesman, Peter Hoogland, made the whole process easy and painless. He put my wife and I at ease with his no pressure approach and vast experience. We got a Camry at a very good price. They outgrew their last location and their new location is large with a great selection.<//review>

I just got my Nissan Armada almost a month ago and I’m so happy with it! Not to mention, it was a decent price. The staff was super friendly and answered all of my questions. I will definitely recommend my friends and family to them!</review>

To begin with I had went into deal time auto sales and was told i was approved for a car they ran my credit and everything was good then when I went back 2 days later to give them the money down they wanted they had sold it. I was upset and wanted that specific car so a young sales man came out and said I can help you nd after I let him know what I wanted he said yeah we'll have it tomorrow then said but you can put the money down right and I said yeah for the car I saw not a car I haven't even seen nor test drove nd he got upset and said I didn't even qualify for the car I originally wanted when the other car sales man said I did.he wanted me to put 2,000 down for a car I hadn't seen nor drove and when I said no he just stormed out and left.< /Review>

Extremely friendly welcoming staff, and large selection of very nice cars. They answered all of my questions and worked with my low income & not perfect credit to get me into something safe for me and my baby. I definitely recommend!< /Review>

Great customer service I must say. They are very friendly and cared about getting me into the right car. I didn’t think I was going to be able to leave the lot driving in my new car but they helped me out and with just $500 down payment no more waiting for the bus for me. Thanks Deal Time<//review>

<Response>{'time': 1576962334012, 'text': "NOTE:  After more research and as I thought, a BOGUS REVIEW!!  This is Jess Winters, Vice President.  As you can tell by our 395+ 5 Star Reviews, we put our Customers experience as our #1 priority.  I checked our system and couldn't find your name anywhere or that you have ever visited Deal Time Auto Sales.  We do get a few of our competitor's Salespeople who will post a bad review.  We take every review seriously, so if your review is legitimate, then please give us the courtesy of a call, so please call me, Jess Winters @ (661) 978-0813 so we can discuss it.  By the way, you have no idea what our final cost is on any vehicle because CARFAX or Experian's AutoCheck doesn't have access to our final reconditioning costs are.  I look forward to hearing from you soon."}<//Response>< name>

<review>Before buying a restored vehicle from this company or any other salvage yard company y.Ask for the VIN# then you can search on BIDFAX.(which is free) and you can see how much they paid for the vehicle, where they got it. How much damage was done, and then shopt your offer. I was interested in a $7500, vehicle they only paid $3000 for it.be a smart buyer people.</review></record>

<Review>Just purchased a truck from Deal Times and I must say I’m impressed with how quick we got all our questions answered and us into a new truck! Yrak Garcia is the man to look for if you want a hassle free no BS quick buy! We had been looking for a while and everyone always gave us the runaround. So if your looking for a fast and professional dealer I definitely recommend Yrak! He is now our sales go to person I will be referring everyone to him!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80ea6a3c2255056d:0x472b06e4a78f037b</gmapID></record>

I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to give you the same Signature 5 Star Experience that over 350 of our customers that not only enjoyed but gave us 5 Star Reviews.   I think you would agree that a quick 5 minute drive by doesn't give you enough feed back to rate us fairly.  We appreciate and welcome all feed back whether good or bad because we can learn from both.  Unfortunately your Review doesn't give us much to work on, but I can assure you that our goal is to never prejudge.  We always strive to treat every Prospect, Customer and Referrals with our Signature 5 Star experience whether they buy or not.  Unfortunately, you didn't give us a fair chance to make you feel welcome.  I'm asking for the opportunity to personally speak with you so I can get your feedback that might help us improve.  Again, my name is Jess Winters, Vice President at Deal Time Auto Sales and can be reached  anytime at (661) 978-081  Hopefully I will be hearing from you soon.  Thank you and have a blessed day.  Since I haven't heard back from you and we didn't get a fair chance to give you the kind of experience we always want to achieve, would you please delete your Review or give me a call at (661) 978-0813 to discuss your dissatisfaction.

Okay I have no idea how they have such high ratings. On multiple occasions I have inquired about vehicles online. Not one time have I got a response. A total of 3 inquiries over the last few months. I am a business owner and this is not professional.</Text>

Sold me a lemon. The head gasket was blown at only 115,000 miles, and the vehicle needed a new engine before I even got the title in the mail. It was leaking oil all over so they must have known and cleaned it up, because i was told it sat on their lot for a month. Of course I paid cash and signed the form that opts me out of any hope of a lemon law. Crooks. Avoid this place, get your used car from an honest person who knows their vehicle.</text>

The most Jankiest carlot I known of from day one when i got my car i been having issues. Beyond Unprofessional. They selling cars and only putting oil changes on them knowing thiers bigger issues with them. I pray you guys don't go through what i been going through. They know what they are doing and they dont care. Long as they get your money first then they are good. DealTime has been a headache from day one.</review>

< Review>
THE WORST DEALERSHIP EVER. We were in desperate need of a car for myself. My boyfriend had went in at 11am told them what exact car we wanted, filled out the paperwork, got everything handled. They told us that they were going to get the car serviced, it was still about 12pm. Still definitely enough time to get the car serviced and available to us THAT SAME DAY. Now we are on the second day of trying to get our car, Ive called and my boyfriend has called to try to figure out if we can get it today and we are still getting the same excuses “it is still in service”. I know from previous experience that it does not take more than a couple of hours to get a car serviced! Customer service was horrible, I was told “well you guys can pick a different car if you want”. I asked how much longer is it going to take and they gave me the answer of “I don’t know it’s in service” If we weren’t in such need of a cheap car then we would definitely had just said forget it. Even though we do need the car I still want to tell them never mind, that is how crappy of a dealership they have. I do not recommend to anyone.<//Review>

***I really want to give zero stars****Honestly thought this was a good place to buy a vehicle due to reviews ive seen but dont let that fool you.
Went in and i wasnt even able to look at any of the vehicles...they automatically took me in and they got me approved for a vehicle i never saw by the time i figured out what car it was i did not like it.....when i spoke to oscar he said it would be impossible to get an SUV seeing how i have 5 kids i need a bigger car......
What kind of customer service is that?
And im sorry but maybe next time you should be more polite talking to people.....oscar was very rude and didnt even want to hear my concerns....as a customer i think i have the right to voice my opinion.< /Review>

Said they would try and get me a loan for a truck , I went on a Saturday they told we have more banks open on Monday so to leave my info n they would run it with the banks ,nothing ever pop up on my credit they didn't wanna work with me also I called 2times in the morning and miday to see results and 2nd time they would pick up my call , so I waited for a week and never received a call . It would have been nice to know that I didn't get approved or I did.</Text>

Thanks Deal Time, I needed a car that could save on gas, and I was able to get a nice 2015 Nissan Sentra , I was only wanting to put down 500, and nothing more, and Deal TIme worked with me, the process was simple and easy, no hassle, no pressure, Thanks to Bryson for making my car buying process stress free, with excellent customer service and great salesmanship skills, if you're ever in need of a nice ride go see Bryson and let it be known that it was my review that convinced you, all bad reviews on here can't override the fact they have a almost 5 star rating, that should tell you something, so go in today I'll promise you as long as you meet the qualifications you'll be impressed with the car buying process, Thanks again Bryson and Deal Time!!!!!<//review>

I would give this dealership half a star if I could. I bought a car here and the car dealer lied to me the entire time about the car. I was told the car had a rebuilt title but it was a salvage! And the car had many problems and did not run within 6 months.< /review>

I had 5 watches that all needed batteries replaced and 2 needed completely new wristbands. ($102) While I couldn’t find a exact replica of the previous metallic band, they were able to suggest several alternatives that still fit the size and style of my watch. I was happy with the relatively quick (about an hour) and friendly service of the young lady and will definitely be back again.< /Review>

I went in to get my watch arm band replaced and for $16, the least that I should have expected was to have gotten something that holds together longer. The loop that holds the strap down came apart as soon as I got it back home. Well, I guess the most I can expect is that they can only replace batteries without issue. You truly get what you pay for.

I'm always so satisfied when I take my watch to Fast-Fix. I bought a lifetime battery warranty 8 years ago and they were happy to honor it and also put in a new screw on my band for free. I also took another watch in thinking I had to buy a new watch band and to my surprise they were able to fix it so of course I bought a warranty for that watch too.</review>

Came here to adjust the bands of my new watch, and was very satisfied with the price it took to do it. Took less than 30 minutes and recommend it to anyone looking for quick and cheap services.< /text>

I get all my watch batteries here. They have a great program whereby they replace the battery if it doesn't last its term. 1 year, 2 years  or 3 years, etc. They mark the battery, so they always know how long it should have lasted.</review>

The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. I had recently purchased  a G-Shock watch, except the band was too big. I checked in to Fast Fix to have my watch adjusted to my wrist. Their clerk had me try on my watch to get an idea as to how many links they needed to remove. Their clerk told me that the adjustment would take roughly 20-25 minutes. I figured I'd kill some time at Macy's. Not even 10 minutes after I left the store, I receive a phone call from the Fast Fix staff, telling me that my watch is ready. I checked back in, and another employee had me try it on. Sure enough, my watch was now a perfect fit. The fair pricing and the great staff definitely earned my business!< /Text>

< review>
Replaced a battery on a piece last year at this business. Needed another battery replacement this year and decided to try another local watch repair shop. Come to find out, the previous battery that was installed was clearly the wrong size. The horologist changing the replacement couldn't believe it, it was almost half the size of the required cell for the watch.

Terrible business practices that I hope the public is aware of when entering your store. Yikes.</review>

I went in to zales to see if they could replace it and repair the prongs. I was given an estimate of a 3 week turn around. Heck no! So I was referred to fast fix and thank goodness for them. I went in at around noon. They said that it could be done by 5 as long as they had the diamond in stock. They cleaned, rhodium plated, tightened the other prongs, and replaced my diamond. I received the call at 4 that it was ready. Amazing! So friendly, so helpful, and so quick. Will definitely come back to them and recommend them.< /Text>< username>

< Review>
Fast-Fix Jewelry has been in the a West Covina mall for as long as I can remember. They can fix any type of jewelry and I've even come to them multiple times for the same piece! Even though I did not buy my original rope chain from them, the staff was very knowledgeable and offered to explain why my chain kept breaking and possible options. They are so friendly and patient. They get the job done, call you when it's ready, get the repairs done in realistic and adequate time, they are honest, and have great prices. Fast-Fix Jewelry also works with you to get you an affordable price for any item and is not forceful or tries to make a sale. I won't go to anyone else for all my jewelry repairs! They log all your fixes and know what's been done to each piece. Most trustworthy business!< /Review>

<Text>Very easy transaction, went in for a battery change. I have a Nixon 51-30 so the backing needs a special tool to take off to replace. It only took 10-15 min and they gave my watch a steam cleaning which made it look brand new! Will definitely go back for more repairs and if I need another battery...<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Awesome fast friendly service! I had a local jeweler quote me a higher price and a 2 WEEK WAIT and laughed when I said I wanted to find somewhere faster thinking I wouldn't be able to. Well I can always find a reason to fo go to the mall and ate at lazy dog and my bracelet was fixed for 10 dollars less in the time it took me to eat dinner. They have some beautiful jewelry in there too!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

This is my second visit here. They're great! They ordered the perfect watch strap for me again straight from the supplier plus gave me additional options and gave their input. I can't wait until my next visit. Highly recommended.</Review>

I always bring my jewelry to be fixed here and I am never disappointed.
Recently I took in a ring my grandmother gave me to be resized and polish, I wish I took a before and after. The ring was old and dingy, not really shiny and when they were done it looked like a brand new ring. I almost cried at how beautiful they left it. Thank you, fast fix!<//review>

I always go to Fast-Fix Years ago I went to another place for a new battery and they told me I needed to have my watch cleaned $100 I left & found Fast-Fix All I needed was a new battery Fast-Fix never cheats you They replace batteries for free when they are still under warranty I brag about Fast-Fix so much  that my friends give me their watches to take to Fast-Fix I also trust them with my wedding rings<//Review>

<Text>I dropped my watch off last week. At first they tell me it would take 3 hours to fix the band on my watch. Upon my return they tell me it's going to be another week because they need to order the part. A week later they tell me that the person who was going to fix my watch is on vacation and it would be another week. People do not bring your watches to be repaired here. They don't keep there word and won't care about your feelings or good customer service.<//Text><Time>1443030970509<//Time><user>108073339583918434480< /user></record></dataset><record>

<review>I came in to get a watch resized, and to put in a new battery. Each cost around $20, which I thought was a bit expensive. (But I don’t know what average prices for these things are, so take my words with a grain of salt.)

True to their name, service was very fast. Only took 30 minutes. The staff is also very polite and friendly.< /review>< date>

There was nothing professional about that place. I went in yesterday to fix my wedding band, simple job to add 2 sizes to it. They told me to leave it and pick it up today, I understand that is the holidays that why I left it. Upon getting there they told me that it was going to be 1 more hour to get it done and that they would call me once it was done; 2 hours later one the mall I have got a call so I showed up and they still tell me that it would take 10 more minutes. 30 minutes later he wasn't done with it. Lack of professionalism.< /text>

< review>
Fast Fix is a rip off. I purchased a diamond ring. I have a receipt stating the ring is 14 kt. gold and diamonds. The owner kept the ring to supposedly polish and clean the ring. I made a statement to him “ok don’t change my diamonds”. Funny how you say things at that moment. Went back ring not ready. Got a call from the owner stating he made a mistake. The ring had sapphire diamonds. Huh? When I went to pick up the ring it didn’t look right. Took the ring to another jeweler and it seemed to have been tampered with. The jeweler stated the stones were a very low cloudy grade of cubic zirconias. Yes, you can see the ring lines are crooked, and dents where they hammered the gold. He totally lied to me. I was so excited about this ring and now I am sad I ended up with no ring. Do not trust this man he might not be giving you what you are paying for!!! I wish I knew how to post the pictures of the receipt and ring. You would be able to see that I am stating the facts!!!!<//review>
<time>1525920993355< /time><Rate>1<//Rate><Response>{'time': 1526772682264, 'text': 'To be clear on this experience, Ms. Mona Diaz was COMPLETELY WRONG. She was going to purchase this particular ring in Jan. 2018. Yes the ring was LABELED 14K Y/G Dia. Ring for the original price of $1200 (The deposit receipt on the picture was based on wrong label) Price was brought down to $900. Ms. Diaz made a deposit of $450 at that time and was to pay the rest later. Ring was left here to be polished. Unfortunately, our jeweler  who has been with us for over 20yrs, noticed it was MISLABELED. Stones were not diamonds but were CZs. We immediately called Ms. Diaz to inform her that the ring had been MISLABELED. I Masood Ghassemi Owner, left her multiple messages, spoke Ms. Diaz multiple times that she did not have to purchase the ring if she was unhappy. We offered complete refund on her deposit. Ms. Diaz insisted she loved the ring and would still like to purchase ring as CZs. Price for ring was appropriately Priced at $300. After several weeks as shown on receipt Ms. Diaz Purchased a 14k Y/G Cz Ring on 4/24/2018 for $300 and received a $150 refund from previous deposit.\nOne week later Ms. Diaz came back and wanted a full refund because she insisted that we " Switched " all stones in ring. We gave her full refund. AS BEING IN THIS BUSINESS FOR 23YRS IN THIS MALL IT WOULD  NOT MAKE ALL SENSE AT ALL FOR US TO TRY TO REMOVE ALL DIAMONDS. In the process of removing all stones from a channel setting, Diamonds as such, would all break and/or chip. Plus resetting CZs into it would cost us a lot of time and money. "Diamonds" removed would be USELESS to us. We did not hammer, modify, or touch the stones. It was the same exact ring we originally showed in January.\nI tried to explain to Ms. Diaz multiple times. We try to do the most honest thing by our customers every single day.\nWE DID NOT SELL HER A DIAMOND RING. WE SOLD HER A 14K Y/G RING W/ CZs RING FOR $300. IT WAS A SIMPLE MISTAKE ON A LABEL THAT WE QUICKLY CORRECTED. Ms. Diaz received a complete refund for $300 after this 4 month ordeal.'}< /Response></record></dataset><record>

They left my glasses broken as it is. My boyfriend went to this place in hopes of fixing my favorite glasses, on top of that paying almost 100$ for it. He waited over an hour for this. I don't even want to add anything else.<//Review>< Pics>

I haven't been to the bar area since it was Amigo's and I must say the bartenders aren't very pleasant. Went in after work for a few drinks with some friends and was disappointed on how much I paid for a drink I could of made better at home. Hoping the service improves over time.<//Text>

The food was decent. We waited for 10 minutes before anyone said the cook was in the bathroom 🤔Mind you it's about 11:30am and everyone is twiddling their thumbs. Hopefully it was just a bad day for the restaurant, but for me; I won't be going back<//Review>

< Review>
The service was TERRIBLE! The girl who waited on us looked like she hated life and didn't even acknowledge us. We asked for the jalapeno poppers and she just walked away at a snail's pace and literally dragged her feet. The food is expensive for the quality. I will never come back here again!<//Review>

<Review>I love this place. I have frequented this establishment 3 years, always good. Every time i come up from Los Angeles i look forward to getting a burrito from Campadres. Easy going and chill atmosphere.
Chicken Wet Burritos are on point. Seasoned well, the rice has flavor and I walk away full. Thats the most important thing. Full and satisfied .</Review>< Response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Don't usually post negative reviews, but my experience there last night was anything but good.  Went there a couple of times before they changed their name and the food was so so.  Thought the name change might mean an improvement in the food.  Not the case.  I ordered a wet burrito with red sauce.  They brought me a burrito covered in green sauce.  Not a big deal.  The bar tender caught the mistake and sent it back.  Couple of minutes later they brought me a burrito covered in a red and green sauce.  Too cheap to remake the burrito, they just put red sauce on top of the green sauce and brought it back.  Might have been good if they remade it, but instead it was just a soggy mess.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80952b8ca054c987:0xf0be5d2bcc575a27< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The girl servers are rude. The blond handling the register is pretty dumb repeated my name 20 times and she turned the register saying “what name?” As she rolled her eyes. Looked like she was hungover of hating life. Never going again. Food was decent this time.</text>

<Text>Arrived at 11:30pm with a few people on a Friday night on March 16th and there were quite a bit of people there which was nice.  We ordered a round of drinks and 15 minutes later at 11:45 the bartender called last call.  People started laughing but then when they realized she was serious they started getting upset.  One guy sitting at the bar even yelled out "are u serious?"  Sure enough she was.  I can see if the bar was dead but it wasn't.   People were still walking in and others were still buying pitchers and drinks.  And money was being put in the jukebox which pissed people off who had just dropped money in it.  I also saw people checking the closing time online which clearly says 2am on friday... as it still does today.  So I guess the bartender had plans or just wanted to go home because I'm sure the owner wouldn't want to close especially if the bar was busy with people still coming in.  If you do not want to be there til 2am then maybe you shouldn't be the bartender.  I'm sure a lot of money was lost that night.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The service was a lil slow when we went for dinner. The server must have left because we were waiting 10 mins until we flagged down another employee. The food portions are good size. I reccomend the wet burrito.<//text>

<review>I am amazed that this place is still opened. The service is horrible. The workers prefer to let the customers stand and wait while they have their conversations that are obviously more important. I have a few complaints, but to list a few: 1. The food prep worker was eating behind the counter and then came to make my food without washing his hands or using gloves. 2. Even a 5th grader knows that it's not safe to microwave styrofoam, yet I watched this being done for a few customers that were waiting. 3. The bartenders will ignore you if you are not one of the drunk guys sitting at the bar. This list could go on and on, but why waste the time. I won't go back again. It's not worth my health. Why should I have to ask for health standards for my food prep????? I would give zero stars if I could.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

We were at the Tulare Thunderbowl Races and I went to ask if I could order something specific, because I have certain food restrictions so I can’t eat certain foods, and the young lady who was supposed to be taking orders was so beyond rude and kept telling me “the menu is right there” and wouldn’t answer my question. I understand that things are different because you aren’t in the restaurant, but I just wanted to know how much it would have been to add rice to my burrito because I can’t eat meat so I didn’t want to order the bigger burrito. The young lady wouldn’t even let me get my question out and she was absolutely rude. I will NEVER give them my service again.<//review>

<text>I ordered a one item dinner, which i picked a crunchy beef taco. The food was not made fresh, the rice was as least a day old and reheated in the microwave.  It had some very hard and burnt pieces and was over salted.  My beans were also very salted, but Im fine if the refired beans were a day old because thats the basic way to cook the beans.  The taco was ok not alot of meat stuffed in it, just really disappointed about the rice.... seriously when people are paying 13 dollars for plate, rice is the basic food that can be made freah everyday and simple.... I can rice make at home and not cost me that much.  There's a tiny taco stand (Mi Casa)by my house and omg the rice is always fresh and the tacos are over stuffed with amazing tasting asada.  I can get 8 tacos and rice and beans for the same price.  So go here for the bar then eat after a ciuple of drinks.</text></record>

This will be the first and last time I come here. All of the employees were rude, I watched food be put into a microwave in a styrofoam container and one employee told the other to “leave the door open when you microwave.” Then the third employee came back from dumping the trash and proceeded to start serving without washing his hands. Next the employees proceeded to stand in front of the menu and lean on the counter while we tried to find what we want, to bad we couldn’t see through their heads. As we ordered we had one request, no pico de gallo on one of the burritos, the lady preparing our food couldn’t even remember that and had to ask twice more as we moved the three foot length of the counter. The cashier acted as if we were inconveniences to her standing and leaning time when we went to pay. The bartender was just as horrible, slamming cups, bottles, and chairs as she closed up and at one point even became aggressive when it was about 20 minutes till last call. All of the employees have poor attitudes and terrible customer service along with horrific cleanliness standards.< /Review>

As I googled their times...it shows 11 PM on a Sunday, however, we were basically being pushed out by 9.....my father and I were still paid customers eating dinner (yes it was late) but we were still to be considered customers and instead of them asking if we would like a refill before they took the caps of the machines we were forced to finish our meal with nothing to drink.......if your going to say your closing at 11 then technically you need to stay open till that time instead of making customers feeling like they are pushed out.....the food quality is not that great either and my cheese was not even melted in my burrito........wouldn’t be a place I’d recommend to tourist or visitors.....<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The cashier had an angry face and treated us poorly, apart from that it is supposed to be a Mexican restaurant where they must speak Spanish and not even that towards the poor cashier 😯, if they have a business, take good care of their customers PLEASE.

(Original)
La cajera tenia cara De enojada  y nos atendio mal,  aparte se supone q es un restaurante Mexicano donde deven hablar espanol y ni eso hacia la pobre cajera 😯,  si tienen un negocio atiendan bien asu clientela por FAVOR.</review>

< Review>
Left my wallet in the restroom and manager said their cameras didn't capture who went in the restroom after me.. Then, my wallet was gone. So either and employee kept it or her. Never did any manager refuse to efficiently run the cameras back to verify. She was absolutely no help, even then they treated me like I'm the one who stole something. Very very unprofessional, uncompassionate and little to no effort type of professional ethical values.<//Review>

< review>
Imagine going to grab a pair of leggings, and finding out that instead of just walking up and grabbing what you need, you have to dig through a nightmare of clothing. I’ve never seen an old navy in such awful condition!

To top it all off, two employees stood behind the counter were gossiping (loudly) while completely ignoring the fact that there was a line. I don’t typically post negative, petty reviews like this but I was really disappointed in the whole place. I get that it’s an old navy, not a Tiffany’s, but good grief.</review>

The staff was polite, cheerful, and attentive. They were very helpful to help me find exactly what I needed. The Young man at the register was very pleasant and efficient. I had a excellent experience.< /text>

CHECK YOUR RECIEPTS!!!! I was overcharged on an item that was on a half price rack, oh and to top it off they charged the item for more than what the original tag says!!!!!! Super annoying when you don't live right around the corner and gotta drive the far distance to get your money back!</Text>

<Review>On Friday 08/02/19 was the last time I will shop at Old Navy. The place was a dump. At the check out line there was a broken bottle of fragrance on the floor, I notified one of the cashiers and she acknowledged me and continued working the register. There were 4 women working the registers. 10 minutes later and the broken glass was still on the floor.  Doesn't the safety of the customers take priority?< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Text>With back to school shopping the store was a mess. People don't put things back where they found them and the workers can't keep up on the cleaning. Some price signs were missing so it was hard to tell what was on sale or not. The lines moved fast and the selection was good.< /Text></record>

Brenda was very helpful.  The stores fairly large but a little messy. But I do understand because I work retail. Found what we needed & wait in line wasn't bad.< /Review>

Waited 20 minutes in line and didn't move. Two cahiers one left and no replacement although I saw at least 3 other employees putting stock away. The one cashier was qorking hard, she called for help and manager came but couldn't use register  Dropped my stuff and placed a verbal complaint and all shed say is "we're short staff" when I left 6 people in line and no one had moved.<//review>

Everything was a total mess sizes all mixed together.   Too much effort for me to find what I wanted. Prices went that great for memorial sale either.<//text>

disorganized, not lot of variety of woman s clothes not compare to the Fresno Old Navy store. Disappointed with this store. also the reward money has an expiration day, it sucks. Way get reward money when they give you a time limit. TJMax give you reward money without expiration day to use when you can. not hard to decide where to shop. Sorry old Navy.</text>

I went to Old Navy today to return an item and I saw jeans for $10!! I didn't walk around because they were right by the line ... I thought yaaay, score!!!!
While in line in front of me a young lady was telling Michael "manager" that the price was incorrect. So he goes and checks it out and honors the price... Great!
My turn... Both the pants I picked (off the $10 rack) were not $10. Mind you, there was more than one of the same kind I picked on the rack, but different sizes!!
I proceed to tell Kathryn, the young lady helping me that they should honor the price because they were on the $10 rack!
Well, Michael "manager" said no. It really bummed me out! Why did he honor the young ladies items but not mine!?
I feel that was very unfair and I will be contacting corporate. I run a store, and I would rather honor a $5 price difference than loss $10 and a customer.
Michael is not a very good manager.< /Review>

< Review>
I use to love shopping at old Navy,  but it has really went down hill as far as appearance,   the clothes were a total mess, shoes thrown all over the floor. It was really sad to see. I really liked old navy.</Review>

Trash, food, in shells, clothes mixed up with other clothes, not to mention sizes.
Would have bought more but needed a guide to find my way around.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Today was my first time trying this place. My sister and her boyfriend were craving poke bowls for lunch and recommended this place. We ordered via postmates. I ordered the large bowl with white rice as the base, 4 proteins - spicy tuna, salmon, scallop, and albacore. I added almost everything to the bowl because I like my poke bowl to be very flavorful and usually get the whole shibang. However, this place doesn’t look like they have that option rather you select what you want. Mix-ins: onion and cucumber. Sauces: house sauce, ponzu, spicy ponzu, sesame oil, spicy mayo, and sweet chili. Sides: crab meat and seaweed salad. Toppings: green onion, cilantro, corn, edamame, Masago, crispy garlic, crispy onion. Drizzle: spicy mayo, eel sauce, lemon  garlic and sriracha on the side. Although I requested for almost close to everything, the bowl was still a bit dry and it did not seem like all the sauces I requested was added. Also they did not provide the sriracha on the side as requested. I’m not sure if they were busy or they just missed adding what was requested. The large bowl was very filling, so make sure you’re hungry if you get this size.

As this was my first time trying this place, I had a different expectation than what I experienced. Honestly, I’ve had better poke from other place. This place was not terribly bad. However, I would not highly recommend this place. Nonetheless, feel free to give this place a chance and see whether you have a better experience than I did.</review></record>

I like this restaurant! They give high quality food, their menu is large, The chief cook in that place is a real pro, I like very much trying all their food. The food is always tasty, the service towards the clients  is friendly. I often go to  this place and I was never unhappy. I recommend it to all.<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Were should I begin!  Upon entering the facility i noticed   there was not a lot of people waiting in line. This made me ultra excited because i wasn't going to be rushed to make my order however, this was not the case. The young  hipster looking female that took my order already seemed as though she came to work in a really bad mood. This has not been the first time as she has previously been in the same type of mood before. As i was placing my order she continuously interrupted me while i was trying to tell her what items i wanted. Thankfully another young lady took over my order however she continued to be rude to the costumer behind me. I heard the gentlemen request additional scoops of a certain topping she very rudely dismissed his request and tossed the bowl to the side of the counter. She seems as she does not belong in customer service. I was so upset over the awful costumer service i experienced that i was unable to enjoy or finish my bowl. MANAGER PLEASE RETRAIN YOUR STAFF ON APPROPRIATE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</Review>< pictures>

I ordered the small poke bowl which is more expensive than the regular on this menu, and was small and provided only 2 proteins. I felt like the server was rushing me while ordering, even though there was no line. The food was pretty bland for the price, i probably won't go again.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Who doesn't love poke? I know I sure do and this place is pretty good but the prices are a little too high for me. If I want poke I can go somewhere else with the same test and a little less expensive.< /Review>

Food is good,  the place looked clean. 1st time being there and don't know if I'd go back Customer Service was bad. Three girls in there working and standing around talking totally no acknowledgement I had to let them know I was ready to order,  the girl that helped me walked up yawning. I tell her it's my 1st time there and her reply was "oh", didn't bother explaining how to order from their menu. The only thing she explained was where to get my fork and napkin. Not worth spending $12. when customer service is not good, friendly. Now I know why the 2 guys that walked in before me and walked out empty handed looked upset. Not good for business either.< /review>

My go-to poke place, and not because its close to my house but because their selection there is fresh, good, and they sometimes put more protein than you think you deserve. It gets pretty busy during lunch time but the line goes by fast. They now deliver through door dash and postmates so you could get your favorite poke at home.< /review>

After reading the reviews I was hesitant to stop in because most people commented on the poor customer service, but honestly I was craving a poke bowl, so I went here anyways. I am happy to say, I was pleasantly impressed,  the selection was very fresh and delicious,  the place is very clean,  and the two young ladies were friendly, very nice and helpful. I will be going back.< /Review>

First time trying poke...this place was delicious! Everything was fresh, clean and tasty. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because of the service we received. Girl wasn’t friendly, in fact was rude and didn’t care to walk us through the steps when I told her it was our first time. She seemed to hate her job. Other than the bad customer service the place was very good.< /text>

I've only been here once, but it was good enough to already write a positive review. I had 3 proteins: salmon, spicy tuna, and scallop along with seaweed salad and edamame. It was fresh, quick, and delicious. Decent prices as well.< /review>

I have taken vehicles here before back before they changed hands in 2016 and once after. I never had any problems before. They can fix your vehicle if they can figure what's wrong with it. My car has suspension problems. I have no check engine light and no super obvious broken parts dangling. So it makes it more difficult to figure out the problem. This was the third mechanic shop I took it to. My current experience with them was very disapointing the tech couldn't figure the main reason I brought it there for. I had to take it somewhere else. So I talked to someone via text who came off as unprofessional. I personally don't plan on dealing with them again.< /review>

<Text>I am literally in tears as I type this. My sister had been searching for weeks for a place to look at her car. Every where she went legitimately tried to take advantage of her until yesterday she found Sam's. Not only is this guy completely professional but trustworthy and honest. He is a rarity. He did a complete diagnostic on her car and had a text sent telling her what's wrong and it was nothing that the others had told her. He fixed it for a fair price and in the same day. Only sad part is hes booked 2 weeks out so you have to schedule with him and get your spot. Its worth the wait.< /Text><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

Took my 2009 Chevy Malibu in to get the water pump replaced. I was stressing cause it's my company vehicle I use to Live Stream. I was referred to Sam Moores Automotive Repair by a trusted friend. There customer service was great. They kept in touch giving me updates on my Vehicles progress. The best News to me was they Got my vehicle done Same Day which was huge for me! The Warranty was great to! 🚨HIGHLY RECOMMEND!🚨 They give there Customer Peace of mind. Which is huge to me when it comes to my Daily Driver Vehicle!<//Review>

If you want great customer service and value for your dollar I highly suggest Sam Moore Automotive. The work they performed was done to perfection and on time. They explained everything that needed to be done and why it needed to be repaired. Two days after the work was completed I received a follow up phone call to make sure the car was operating correctly and to find out if I was satisfied with the work. I have total confidence in this business to handle all my automotive repair needs. Dave, thank you to you and your team for exceeding our expectations!</review>

This last time I was dropping by my truck for a conversion from r12 refrigerant for the ac to r134a.

I was quoted for one price and we paid quite another.

The difference was a few hundred dollars and I wasn't contacted before they did the work. They called me to say it was done. I came after work right before their shop closed, and signed and paid. I was really surprised by the difference in price, but I didn't want to raise a fuss right as they were trying to close. Later on, my friends told me that mechanics are supposed to let you know before they do any work that's going to cost you more money. I wish I had known that at the time of paying for it, but I had already signed and handed over the credit card. Because of that, I own my mistake of paying before I talk to someone about an issue, and chose not to contact them for any sort of recompense. I'm just going to choose a shop that isn't so out of the way and is more communacative.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Sam Moore’s Automotive is outstanding! I don’t know what I would do without Dave and the crew. Prior to the loss of my husband, I took our vehicle maintenance and repair for granted.  Not only does this shop maintain and repair the vehicles, they go above and beyond, they are so very patient explaining everything, and you couldn’t want for a more professional, honest, and thorough experience. It is a comfort to know that the vehicles are safe and ready for the road. From the staff at the front desk, to the crew, to the commitment and patience of the owner, Dave, the service and care can’t be beat. Thank you!<//Text>

I needed help with the oil in my car..couldn't do it by myself. I work across the street , went over to the shop after I got off work. It was after they usually close. The gentleman was friendly, professional and so very helpful.  If I ever need anything done to my car , I will take it to him. Cant say enough good things about them. Thank you so very much for helping me!< /review>

I was referred to Sam Moore’s Automotive from a friend who said they were great mechanics, friendly, and at a fair price. I was very happy with their work. They fixed what I brought it in for, but they also fixed by back up camera that I was having trouble with. He rewired the whole back up camera system and was able to get it working for me!! They were professional, but very friendly. They are very knowledgeable and were able to correctly diagnose and fix my vehicle. I appreciate them picking me up when the vehicle was done. Thanks! We will be back!<//review>

Sam Moore's has been a lifesaver for me on multiple occasions. My most recent go around had to do with my 2014 Camaro. I was having electrical issues for weeks and had been to the Chevy dealer a few times, Chevy could never find the problem and ended up sending me home with a 250$ bill each time.

Today I was having the same electrical issue with my car and decided to drive it straight to Sam Moore's. Best. Idea. Yet.

I pulled up and asked if someone could look at it while it was still running and they both dropped everything to come out and check it out. A couple hours later I was able to swing by and get my car, free of charge because they were able to fix the problem by resetting the battery. They even gave me a ride home while they held onto my car.

If your having car problems, don't waste your time with overpriced dealers. Take it here. Thanks guys!< /review>

Dave took such good care of me when my alternator kicked the bucket! Great service and fast turnaround. Best customer service in town. They’ll tell you what’s wrong with the car before you pay anything and treat you like family- the owner even offered to drive me to work while my car was being looked at so I wouldn't be late!<//review>

<review>By the grace of god we somehow found SMO first it was my sons car that was having the issue and they treated him awesome and i was shocked to see that the cost was less than 4 other places we had received estimates on and are quick in doing the repairs too. They have awesome employees that honestly care about you and your vehicle which is extreamly rare in this day and age. So when i needed to get my vehicle looked at of course i took it to them and i was shown the same kindness they bestowed upon my son. No need to look any where for other repair shops anymore we have found the only one we want and will go to and its Sam Moore's Automotive. Thank you from the bottom of my heart y'all are awesome!!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea44814f1905bb:0xf803c74d72931b38< /gmap_id></record>

Then on Tuesday I heard it making a sound when I turned it on so I took it back and they proceeded to figure out the problem which was a very large job. We were under a time restraint and they guaranteed they would have it back to us. We drove it out of town and have not had any further problems. Great customer service. Will definitely use them again in the future.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Not only for me but I have recommended him to many friends. He is very knowledgeable and honest. He will not do anything that is not needed. Strong Christian man and runs his business accordingly. I highly recommend him. 😁< /text>< pictures>

<text>There are only  a few places I know where I can hand over my car keys to someone and say fix it!  I know my car will receive what it needs at a reasonable price and I don't have to worry about it getting anything it doesn't need.  Peace of mind is available at Sam's Auto.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Recently my heater went out on my car. Took it into the dealership where they wanted to charge me a ridiculous amount just to inspect it. I ended up bringing my car here & im so glad I did. They were fast, affordable, kind, and explained everything to me in depth. The staff was hilarious and made us feel at ease. I absolutely recommend Sam Moore’s automotive repair!<//review>

I have utilized the services of Sam Moore's Automotive for years. Usually, when a change of ownership is involved you run into service issues that cause frustration, however, when Dave took over the business several years back he not only met my expectations but has continually exceeded them. Dave is a man of integrity with a level of honesty rarely seen in the automotive repair industry. I highly recommend Sam Moore's Automotive for all of you transportation maintenance needs.</Text>

<Text>Outstanding service and outstanding mechanics.  Sam Moore's Automotive has worked on my newer truck and my wife's vintage Mercedes.  On every occasion the vehicle problems were properly diagnosed and fixed accordingly.  The work is priced commpetative and always fare and reasonable.  I can personally attest to the warranty of work.  Can't say enough about this shop.  Extremely competent and of high morality.< /Text><Name>James S< /Name>< rate>

Other than keeping the truck too long.'}<//response>
<review>Do not go to this place! They over charge!  Charge you for parts and labor and dont confirm about what's wrong with your car or truck  before fixing. I installed  new parts before I took my truck to there shop. They told me that the brand new parts I had put on was no good. When I knew the where because I tested before I dropped off truck. My bill was 558.00 and they keep my truck for 3 days with no call.  I had to call every day.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>This is no longer Sam Moore's Automotive. It was purchased last summer by a new owner, and it definitely is not the same. I took my F150 in because of a fuel issue. The quote($1700) which cost me $100 just to look at my truck, included fixing my air conditioning(which was working fine), spark plugs, wires, and a new wire harness. I don't think they actually knew what the problem was. I had to take the truck elsewhere to get it fixed. Never again.< /review>< pictures>

Sam Moore's automotive is not honest and should be put out of business!!! Dave quoted me 1900 dallors to patch my engine.  It cost me 1700 for a brand new one! Are you kidding me! They lie and they act like Christians no way !! Sorry but they are liars and cheats !!!< /Text>

<text>Just started going to Harbor Point. We love it. Incredible teaching from the Pastors. Outstanding Worship music. We've been hunting for a new church since the back off of Covid. I think we found it. Thank you Lord for leading us to Harbor Point Church. May we follow you and your teachings Lord.</text>< Pics>

I've tried out a few different churches in the Orange County area since relocating and each one was special in their own way. For me Mariners South County left a lasting 1st impression because I was warmly welcomed by both the staff as well as the fellowship. The Pastor was funny and when the worship team took the stage I felt like I was at a concert! :)<//Text>

Proud to call this place my home. Recently this church merged I was from the other campus. I think things only got better. Everything just worked. Incredible place to learn about God and a great place to make life long relationships.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I was inspired to check out Mariners church after seeing how they helped my kids elementary school with donations of time and money as people at the church organized the community and church goers to give the school a facelift. I also saw Mariners extend open arms to all kids of people who were outcasts and fallen on hard times. As I researched the church I learned they had several campuses throughout Orange County.  I read some mixed reviews on google. I read a review from a local guide who apparently had never walked into the church itself. Inside the church I was greeted and offered help in finding where I was headed. The church has several ministries going that are extremely impactful to the community. I participated in a Mexico mission trip where the church has been serving for many years by helping children attend schools. I also observed a whole building at Mariners Irvine devoted to Student ministries for the upcoming youth. I also Noticed a whole Care and recovery building in Irvine open to anyone from any campus or any faith - devoted to multiple care and recovery platforms from Alcoholics Anonymous and Women's care and recovery ministries to Men battling sexual addiction. Never did I see a church or a set of people more interested in being in the community for the community than Mariners Church. Well done Mariners the work visible here is not of this world and that brings me to my last point. Humble leaders never pretending to be anything other than broken men and women seeking the Lord with all of their heart. I now call this church home and look forward to how the church and I will serve in the future.< /text>< Pics>

Attended for the first time 12.02.18 in the 11:30am service. The pastor named Jeff who spoke during this service chose to pander for laughs and likes from the congregation instead of presenting the Word of God with authority. Most of the service time consisted of him telling many silly personal stories with trivial details to appease the congregation instead of presenting the Word. Coddling the congregation and watering down God's Word is not the way to nurture the hungry souls of God's children. This service appeared to be more of a comedy hour to glorify pastor Jeff than a time to glorify and grow closer to Jesus. Jeff spent about 5 to 7 minutes at the end of the service actually speaking about some Biblcal information. Not once did he encouraged the congregation to bring a Bible or get a hold of a physical Bible if they did not own one. Phones, apps and slideshows are not an acceptable substitute to God's printed word. Pastoral service is not conforming to what we think that those congregated would like to hear, but speaking the truth without fear of what others might think. Being a pastor is not a role to which we are to seek to glorify ourselves like a Pharisee, it's about Jesus and what He's done for us. It's hard to understand that in a culture of self-absorbency like the one in Orange County. We don't come to a church to hear the pastor, we come to hear what GOD has to say to us. May you have eyes to see and ears to hear.

Some of the other reviews mention the ambiance and snacks. These are mere bread and circus my friends. The truth is if the staff, who are very much held accountable for every word that comes out of their mouths, are not feeding you God's unadulterated TRUTH they are not obeying God and are doing you zero good. It's easy to appease people with food, drink & comedy. Obeying God and delivering His Word is more challenging and the real point of gathering. A superficial and worldly church will comfort your body, a living church will cultivate your soul. Jeff and other pastoral staff: Will you be able to look back and testify before Father God that you did EVERYTHING He directed you to do in order to reach His children?

Being aware of the symbolism presented on your building or stage or property is important. Your decorations on stage were satanic pyramids with the all seeing eye.<//Text>

Fast and easy. Made an appointment to remove an old mattress with Got Junk for the next day. They called twice before arriving. Jason and Darrell of LA Metro wore masks and were very pleasant and efficient. In and out in less than five minutes. Would recommend them for removal of any large items.</review>

These guys are great! They came by on a Saturday, moved everything out of an office, very professional, very clean and efficient. Once all the moving was done they even took the time to sweep and vacuum everything. Definitely would recommend them!< /text>

<review>We called for an estimate and within two hours Jason, Jose P and Mark showed up. After looking at what we needed to have removed, we agreed on a fair price. They worked quickly to get the job done. They all had great attitudes and did a fantastic job! I will call and request this team again whenever I need any junk removed!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Much appreciative of the great work that “1-(800) GOT-JUNK” did for us.....the crew came by in a timely manner (on schedule) and were so helpful and professional! Major Kudos to Jason and his partner Robert for the swift and careful work they did traversing my top floor duplex to remove all my unwanted furniture. Highly recommend for anyone in the LA/Metro area for all types of junk removal at a moments notice! Will definitely use your services for future needs! Thanks guys! Such a great job today!

<review>I had an awesome experience dealing with 1-800-Got Junk.  The initial confirmation calls with Stephen were very pleasant and informative.  I was again notified when they were on their way.  Upon arrival, I was as pleasantly greeted by Stephen along with Jose H.  After their evaluation of my items, I was clearly advised of the cost and although it was slightly higher than my budget, the end results were amazing and I was totally satisfied with not only the cost but the great job that was performed by this team. Thank you for your services and I look forward to not only referring the service to others but as well to use the services again for my next round of getting rid of “stuff”. 😊< /review><Time>1620150300604<//Time><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x80c29dc68c40b289:0xcea452c99c630bde< /Gmap_id><user_name>Denise Brown< /user_name><user_id>109019598188313295532< /user_id>< rate>

This was a great experience. Jason and Robert were the guys that showed up to help me remove my box spring from the curb. They called first to communicate that they were on their way so I would know when to expect them. Everything was so quick and efficient. They were also incredibly warm, friendly, sincere, and accommodating. Thank you guys!!< /Review>

<Review>This is by far one of the very best, consistently professional companies I've used (more than a dozen times in 15 years).  They come when they say (or earlier, with a call) and have been without exception, and employ the nicest and most professional individuals. You will not be disappointed. I certainly haven't been.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1617286899468, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving this fantastic feedback for our team, Mona!

I would give them 6 stars if I could.  Daryl and his crew were amazing.  Very hard working, trustworthy and so customer friendly.  They worked with me on the price and still came in under budget.  They went above and beyond in every way.  This is the second time I’ve used 1800gotjunk and would use them every time.  Worth every penny!< /Review>

<text>Connor and Steven went above and beyond to rid me of a hot tub which had been illegally dumped on my property. They updated me throughout the day on their estimated time of arrival (which did not change) and arrived at the time they estimated. Very prompt! They also were dedicated to getting the hot tub removed - they had to unload about half the truck (which was already packed with other people's junk) in order to get the hot tub loaded. They did all this extra work without a complaint. Further, the price was extremely reasonable especially considering the extra work involved.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29dc68c40b289:0xcea452c99c630bde< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

1-800-GOT-JUNK was great. They were communicative through the entire process. Upfront about their pricing model and packed my junk so it took up only the space It needed, no shady “space price” inflation. They arrived on time and Damon and Robert were friendly and efficient. I would absolutely use them again.</Review>

Jason and Noel picked up our couch and we’re very professional and efficient. There was a miscommunication on cost and they willingly worked with us to sort it out. Very satisfied with their service.< /Review>

I also appreciate that they make efforts to donate what they can of the junk they pick up. But because of the pricing, I’d only recommend this in a pinch. Other than that, thanks guys!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>When I needed a broken 65” tv removed from my house, I googled TV removal & 800 got junk came up. I filled out my information online and within minutes received  a phone call from Jason. He explained that they’d be on their way in the next hour or so. Jason & Jose H were quick, prompt, safe, and very nice and Courteous. If you’re looking to get junk moved out quickly, without the hassles of trying to find a large vehicle, packing it, and driving to a dump. This service is highly recommended. Thank you Jason and Jose H !!< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

Great communication and assistance! Julian was great in guiding me through the quick and straightforward process while Brandon worked his magic loading a good portion of the items. I was also quite surprised at how well they work together, coordinating the lifting of items and making sure they are supporting each other as well.
They were efficient, funny, and an awesome team to work with. I will definitely use this company again!< /Text>

These guys are the best in the business. Jason, Connor Y, Will and Andrew, not only were you professional and courteous, but it seems like you enjoy your work! Thank you for making our move that much easier! We are moving homes and had a lot of household junk, including furniture!  I kept adding to the pile - and they were friendly and helpful. Even offering to carry items that I wasn’t having hard away. Moving is hard - but I would use this team every time.<//Text>

I needed to get rid of loads of cardboard boxes for my recent move. Getting rid of the amount of boxes I had would’ve taken me months to get rid of through local waste management which is why I looked into using other services.

Brandon and Greyson were so great! They were super professional and timely.  The whole process was super easy and efficient - booking was a breeze and they even called ahead to confirm their arrival time. The original estimate was over my budget but they gave me a discount to make it work. :) Once we decided on the price, they loaded everything up and on their way. The whole process took less than 15 min.

Thank you so much! Will definitely use them again if I have bulk items to get rid of, highly recommend. Huge plus is knowing that they will recycle it!< /Review>

While the prices are rather steep, they were thankfully willing to negotiate down to a place I could afford. The two gentleman who came by, Mark and Stephen, we’re outstanding! They not only hauled away my old couches, they helped get my new ones into my house, which the furniture company wouldn’t due to Co-vid. Without their help, I’d be outside sitting on my new couches, instead of nice and cozy inside. Thanks again guys!<//Review>

<review>I set up an appointment with 1-800-GOT-JUNK online only a few hrs before the proposed pick up time. I chose midday because I thought I’d be lucky if they even registered my time but not only did they honor my appointment, they ended up calling and coming early as they had finished their other appointments ahead of time. They’re just that good! Jason and Paul were fast, friendly and easy to work with. Can’t imagine calling anyone else for my junk removal needs moving forward!< /review><rating>5</rating><Name>Ryan Porter<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I needed the world's heaviest floppiest mattress removed from my apartment and I was so overwhelmed at the thought of trying to get it to the curb by myself. I was able to make a same day appointment and Jason and Everett took care of the beast in like 30 seconds. They were super courteous and friendly, all masked up and everything.< /Text>

The whole experience was great!

Jason, Connor and Nestor were extremely efficient and quiet and took multiple large pieces of furniture in under an hour and didn’t scuff or damage anything.

No disappointment at all!<//text>

1-800-Got-Junk pulls a little bit of a “Gotcha” though.
The website gives a base price, but they don’t give an estimate until they get there... and their prices are HIGH and based on space used in their smallish truck.  So the price jumps quickly.

Having said that. Their associates were super friendly and pleasant.< /Text>< Pics>

We recently lost both our parents and needed to have some furniture taken away.  Jason and Devon were so gracious and kind.  They were respectful of our situation and helped us overcome an extremely emotional transition. We highly recommend Jason and Devon!  And thank you 1-800-Got-Junk for sending us two kind souls.

<review>The simplest and the easiest , I called last night and they picked up the next day. Conner called 30 min before arrival and arrived on time,  He was very  professional and friendly Also the other guy that assisted him was very professional and friendly  but didn’t catch his name. For sure this will be my to go to for any clean up. On top of that is was cheaper than getting one of those off the street hauling guys, and way more convenient.

I paid the minimal payment to remove one 3 seater couch which turned out being around $175. Comparing that price to a dump run that would’ve cost me about $35 seemed a little steep. But I didn’t have the time to do a dump run so $175 it was. The service gets 5 stars. They were awesome & it was stress free they came when they said & it was very simple & quick. The guys were super awesome. Overall I’m happy just the price was a little steep.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< date>

Jason and Stephen were both very professional helping us dispose of the furniture that didn't make the cut getting packed for our cross-country move. They arrived when then said they would and got everything out, even a couch that didn't quite fit down the hall & a desk that I neglected to property break down.</Review>

<review>The representatives were communicative about their schedule and timing, when their earlier job ran later than expected.  They were both pleasant and courteous, and got to work right away. I was surprised at how quickly they handled removing my discard items from 3 different locations on my property. I  look forward to calling on 1800GotJunk in the near future; it is such a relief to have free space that was once unnecessarily cluttered.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>Steven and David did a great job getting a beast of a medical filing  cabinet out of our office. Little did anyone know, it was bolted to the ground so it took them  3 hours to disassemble it and take it away. Would’ve given 5 stars but our carpet was pretty messy from their shoes tracking in dirt, which required a carpet cleaner to get it clean again.<//text>< Rating>

I cannot say enough about how great this company is. From the first phone call, to the truck coming to pick up the stuff. Prices were fair, everyone was extremely professional. Clean cut, very polite men came to the house right on time. They kept me informed before the pickup as to what time they would arrive. They were quick and did an amazing job. I will definitely use them again. Great job!!!<//review>

Jonathan and his partner arrived promptly - from times indicated. Were masked, friendly, and explained how the service works. Price determined by how much their truck is filled. They didn't need it all organized or on the curb, though did that for them. Chose to use GOT-JUNK because had a large carpet that wasn't able to break down for the city. All in all, they were fast, and organized the items to pre-determine if they are to recycle or donate. Pretty cool..they use some of the same drop offs as the City, but for me, had enough things to not have to drag it all to the curb. Gave them a big tip and they were on their way. Thank YOU GOT-JUNK!< /review>

<Review>Stephen and Paul showed up on time, explained the pricing and made quick work of my trash haul. They even offered to sweep. As they were hauling my junk they offered tips on other things they could help with and how to optimally schedule future pickups if needed.< /Review>< Pictures>

1-800-JUNK is one of the most phenomenal companies that I've ever had the pleasure of working with! Friendly, Trustworthy, Professional, Efficient, and I could go on and on. An amazing organization and a tremendous group of people. I had, (And continue to have) the unfortunate task of cleaning out 40 years of someone else's," Hoarding" past. 1-800-JUNK was recommended by my sister. From my first phone call to fruition I was delighted. 1-800-JUNK exceeded my expectations 100+times over. The process fast, tidy, and more than kind to my pocketbook. Also, knowing that many items would be donated to families in need warms my heart. Daniel,( The rep who transported the junk) was so kind while he worked alone traversing many trips up and down unforgiving stairs but never complained. He worked tirelessly he was simply fantastic. The local Operations Manager, Sven reached out prior to my scheduled pickup date and answered all my questions while calming my nerves and anticipation. This was over and above what I could have imagined. Sven, and Daniel,in fact the whole 1-800-JUNK team are truly compassionate people!!! Please, if you are in need of Junk removal call 1-800-JUNK. I am truly humbled by my experience 🙏< /review>

This company was great and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone and will use it again myself. I was able to get people out here in less than an hour from my phone call. Daniel and Jose were awesome! They showed up early, were very kind, and did an incredible job. They even swept after taking away my items! Thank you so much for everything :)</review>

I was very pleased with the entire experience. I easily booked an appointment online, someone called me before my pickup window to let me know approximately when they would arrive. As promised, they arrived on time gave me the estimate and efficiently removed everything. The gentleman that removed my furniture were kind and professional. I would recommend to anyone!<//Review>

Jason and Stephen came through and handled business in minutes. 1st time using JUNK LA, and they earned my future business with their timeliness, work ethic, and professionalism. Had two huge pieces of old furniture, on the second floor of a complex.

They were in and out in less than 15 minutes. Unbelievable!<//text>

<text>Noel and Daniel were awesome!  They explained everything before they loaded up their truck. They were very courteous.  I appreciated their hard work in taking all our junk away and the fact that they cleaned up after they removed everything was amazing. I highly recommend these two kind souls.  I would request them again if I need them to come out again.< /text><Rating>5</Rating><user_name>Debra Bowling< /user_name><Time>1592584376418<//Time><gmap_id>0x80c29dc68c40b289:0xcea452c99c630bde<//gmap_id>< pictures>

<Review>We really needed to do spring cleaning and had a lot of items/bed frames/and other junk that were just taking up space. We decided to call 1800GOTJUNK and getting our specific time and day of the appointment was very easy. When the truck arrived, Jason and Stephen were really helpful and made clearing all the items very painless. They just asked me what needed to get removed and I just pointed to all the areas that needed to be clean and they did it with no questions. When all the items were in the truck, there was dirt and trash on the street that our old items had collected in the garage and they even sweep the whole area up and clean the area! At the end, they even asked me if there was anything else that I needed help with such as moving things around in the garage or anything else and that was a cool personal touch that was much appreciated. As far as safety protocols due to COVID, they followed all the proper precautions and made me feel safe and comfortable. The whole process from making the appointment, to the phone call Reminders about the upcoming service, to Jason and Stephen being the service techs and being very professional and courteous, the entire experience was A+ rated and we are very happy with the outcome. Thanks again and we will definitely use 1800GOTJUNK again in the future!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

I’ve used 1-800-Got-Junk for over four years now in two different states. They always come on time and they are fast and efficient. Jason and Steven D. came by this morning and made short shrift of the multiple items we needed to get rid of. I highly recommend them and the guys that removed our items today.</Review>

These guys did not get the job done. I showed them the bags of trash on the side of my house (3 trash bags + 1 box that couldn’t fit in the garage) and I had 2 boxes of junk and a luggage in front of my house. They only took the 3 items in front even though I showed them everything I wanted them to take. I can not believe I wasted my money on this service.<//Text>

<Review>Jason and Stephen showed up on time, we're extremely courteous, and extremely efficient. Both wow masks throughout the entire job and explained everything clearly and completely. It was a little more expensive than I was anticipating, but the ease at which the entire job was handled definitely made up for the difference. Would 100% use them again!<//Review>< pics>

They were EXCELLENT EXCELLENT WORKERS!!!!  We are amazed at the carefulness and work speed!!  They had excellent work ethics, happy people and helpfulness.
They were such a pleasure to work with. They showed up on time and worked diligently and finished the job at my dad's place.  My dad passed away more than 3 yrs ago and it had been hard for me to complete this last phase. However , with their understanding and empathy it really made this more bearable.
I would call on Connor and Justin ANYTIME AGAIN!!
I have another BIG PROJECT FOR THEM NEXT YEAR or even sooner!
These guys came with mask and took extra covid precaution.
They are my "Obiwon Kenobi" (my only hope!!) and came through for me.
They didn't price gouge me and charged me fair and square.
I would definitely use these two guys!!  They went in as "boys" and came out as "MEN!"  Strength lies within these great workers!!!!< /text>

<Review>Jason and Mark were very courteous, extremely professional, and did a fabulous job of clearing our junk pile.  We were their last stop and they somehow managed to get our large junk pile onto their mostly filled truck.  Great service, will definitely use 1-800 Got Junk again.<//Review>< Response>

Today Andrew and Daniel came over to help with furniture removal, and they were very careful, and considerate of flooring and walls to make sure they did not scratch anything. And I appreciate that awareness.

They arrived a little early and called before hand to make sure the time was good. Everything was removed within 15 min. They work efficiently and are very personable.

I can’t recommend them enough.

The two person team that answered the call were very professional and worked in a timely fashion.

Jason and Mark should get special recognition for their proficient work ethic. Any company would be happy to have assets like them as a part of their team - so, 1-800-GOT-JUNK please give them props!

Due to the continuous positive experiences I’ve received from this company - they are my “GO TO” for junk removal and I highly recommend their services.

Daniel and Steven arrived promptly at the start of the appointment window.  They, in fact, had to wait for me to get home.  They were both friendly and polite and introduced themselves with names and handshakes.

Showed them what I was looking to have removed.  They provided the quote and explained the basis for the amount.  At no time, did I feel any pressure or obligation to accept their services.

Their friendliness and professionalism was greatly appreciated.  I would definitely seek their help in the future.< /Text>

They came and gave us a quote that was reasonable. They worked quickly and efficiently. They did a lot to really pack it in, as the quote was based on volume. They worked so well that the actual price was slightly lower than the quote. They were extremely professional in their appearance and manners. Super appreciate the hard work. Thank you.< /Review>

Gabriel and Jaime provided great service. I got a call 30 minutes before my service window and another call to let me know they were on the way. They quote was fair and they removed the couch and additional items quickly and safely from my apartment building. They were friendly and easy to deal with. I definitely recommend this service if you need to get rid of things quickly. Thank you!< /Review>

So appreciative of the fine work done by Stephen and John M this morning. Their courteous service began with a call early this morning prior to the job to give us their estimated time of arrival. On time and true professionals. They quickly assessed the job and took all of the items that needed to be removed. A quick and easy experience. We will definitely be using Got Junk for our future needs!< /Review>

<Text>Quick and Easy!

I had a small job and the guys at 1-800-GOT-JUNK came through!

Called them at 10:30am and they were out by noon. They gave me a quote, I accepted and they went to work. Zack and Jovanni were courteous and fast.

I will for sure be using them in the future if/when the need arises!< /Text>< Time>

<text>John P and Jason arrived at the time stated and were ready to work. They provided me with a brief run through on their service pricing. They were not pushy and shared the price quoted is without obligation. They were careful removing my junk. I am satisfied with the service they provided.<//text>< pics>

Jason and Jose got the job done instantly. They even called to see if I’d like my junk picked up at an earlier time and had me pay right away to ensure a quick job. The entire thing took about 5 minutes and was very easy, especially with two employees who were so friendly and accommodating.< /Text>

Both, Noah and Robert, exemplified customer service and interaction as they removed the necessary items from our residence.  Their good natured attitudes and ability to work as a team should not be overlooked.

<Review>My experience with 1-800-GOT-JUNK was a positive one. My drivers showed up within an hour of making the reservation and they even came back 2 hours later when they couldn’t fit everything on the truck! They also worked very hard to go back and forth to load my junk! Positive experience!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Had amazing service from Juan and Mark this morning. I set up an appointment in the morning to get rid if a mattress, heavy, wooden bed frame, and headboard. They called 30 minutes prior to the appointment to touch base with the process and were very friendly and polite.
When they arrived, they were very quick and efficient with taking out the furniture!< /text>< rating>

<Review>Service was great. Connor and Nestor communicated with me throughout the morning and showed up right when they said they would. Even though my unit was in the back of the building on the second floor, they were able to pick everything up and load it into the truck in under an hour, and even cleaned up after.

I had a great experience with Leo and Daniel from one 800-GOT-JUNK.  They were both courteous, strong and thorough. It was easy to schedule and easy to get a hold of them. They help me with a problem that I wasn’t sure I was going to solve so I am so grateful and happy to have Leo and Daniel help me with JUNK🙏</review>

Leo and Daniel were FANTASTIC! Professional, friendly, great communication leading up to their arrival. It was my first experience using this service and they made it a smooth and stress-free process. I would absolutely use this service again. You’ll be in great hands if Leo and Daniel show up at your door.< /Review>

1-800-got-junk saves the day! I needed a quick haul away of a sectional sofa and they came just one day after calling. I had not found a charity that could get it in a timely manner so they’re speedy pickup date was a lifesaver.  I also feel good about using their service because they will donate it to a local charity. The employees were wonderful as well. Highly recommend.<//text>

< Review>
Zack and Blake helped us last weekend. My husband and I were in such a time crunch as we were moving and had leftover furniture that we didn’t want to take with us. The furniture was very heavy and Zack and Blake were professional and helpful. They had no problem removing our furniture for us and were extremely accommodating. We felt very comfortable with them and will definitely use them in the future. Great customer service! They went above and beyond!< /Review>

Whole experience was pleasant and easy. Would totally ask them to come back for anything else I needed gone.<//review>

I'm a designer, and have used these guys many times to remove junk, old furniture and unwanted items from clients' homes and offices.  I especially love the fact that they will handle donation of old or unwanted furniture on behalf, so that usable pieces we might be getting rid of don't go to waste.  Connor and Dre are a pleasure to work with -- they're friendly, resourceful, efficient, and on time.  Straightforward, easy, and my go-to junk and furniture removal people.< /Text>

<Review>I used 1-800-Got-Junk? through Casper. Pickup was scheduled same day and Daniel and Kyle were prompt, courteous, very aware of safety and our home while carrying out an old futon from the second floor that our son had slept on for six years. I would definitely use this service again and I would personally request these two hard working young men. They were mannerly and personable while doing a very good job. Good representatives of their company! I can see why Casper partners with 1-800-Got-Junk?<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Amazing service!!! My Aunt had passed and we had made furniture donations to Habitat for Humanity and had horrible experiences. Blake and Anthony arrived and were so respectful of our loss. Professional and careful not to damage the house or furniture. The small amount of money I paid for the service was well worth it.<//review>

This service was exactly what we needed to finish our moving process. We had a bunch of boxes and packaging that had accumulated throughout our house. With 1-800-GOT-JUNK? LA Metro, we were able to have it taken away while we continued setting up our new home. Plus, they recycle the junk!! Dre and Gabriel were prompt and courteous, thoughtful and friendly -- definitely request them! 1-800-GOT-JUNK? is a convenient and hassle-free way to clean up quickly!</Text>

She was able to cut us an amazing deal for ALL our junk. A very kind lady who didn’t have to do what she did. We are extremely greatful for the service provided. The two men that helped take out our junk, Daniel and Kyle, were very kind and helpful as well, making it easier for us to move. Thank you 1-800-GOT-JUNK!!! :)<//Text>< pictures>

I like to commend Robert and Conner from 1800 GOT JUNK.    They did a great job today. I needed a large tv and a very large tv console removed from my home. They arrived within an hour an hour of my call. They were pleasant and professional  representatives of 1800 GOT JUNK. I would use the services of 1800GOT JUNK  and Robert and Conner again.</Review>

<Text>I called for an estimate at about 11:30am.  At about 11:45 the Got Junk truck was outside and up walks Juan & Jaime.  Willing to help me move some stuff out of the way so that they could get a better Idea of the load size, I got a no pressure estimate with time to think about it and call back if I wasn’t ready to commit. Well, the price was right and I committed and 1800 GotJunk was pulling out of my driveway at 12:30 with all of my junk. Before they left they cleaned up the leftover debris and put everything back the way it was. It was a great experience.< /Text>< user_name>

<Text>I can’t say enough about Stephan and John. I did a big garage clean out during the Thanksgiving holiday. I underestimated the work and took 3 days to complete it. I ended up with a large pile of junk. On Saturday night I booked 1800 got junk to come pick it up. I did not think anybody would show on Sunday during a holiday weekend. To my happy surprise Stephan and John showed up! They came on time during the time they said they would arrive. They were professional, efficient and clean. Stephan and John and 1800 Got Junk are 5 stars in my book!<//Text>< Pics>

Connor and Dre came out and assessed the mess, and clearly explained the process, the quote and were able to address all of our questions and concerns on the spot. These guys work quick, effectively, were very professional and made the whole process a breeze.

Great company. Quick to make an appointment, and to follow up on it as promised. They said they would be at my house to pick up an old Cal-King size mattress between 4:00 and 6:00 pm, but the would call when they were near the house. At 4:15 this very polite man called to say they would be here in 15 minutes. It was raining. In 15 minutes exactly, John Medina and Jason Flint were at my door, introducing themselves and shaking hands, all smiles. They went immediately to work, getting the mattress out in no time, making sure no furniture was disturbed. I recommend the company, and these two men, wholeheartedly.</review>

<text>Dre and John M were absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend them!

They showed up on time and were incredibly friendly. Not only did they haul away our unwanted items, but they also helped me bring in some Amazon packages. They had positive attitudes and made the whole process easy.

I am a repeat customer and will continue to reach out to Got Junk for all of our trash removal needs.</text>< Pictures>

I called Got Junk at 9:13AM and they were at my house by 10:30AM.  The Connor team of 2 were professional, courteous and the job was done in less than 10 mins as I had a only a few things including old carpet mats to go.  I spent $208 which includes the 20% tip I gave them for their work.  I would hire Got Junk again.  Thank you for the service!

<review>This is our second time using 1-800-GotJunk. The first time was a good experience, but I just had the best experience with Juan and Conner.

My appointment was set for early in the morning, they called to confirm my appointment but I was driving so I couldn't pick up - instead, Juan sent me a very courteous text message explaining who he was and confirming our appointment. I called back and he confirmed his window of arrival and unlike every other delivery service I've had to deal with, they were pleasantly right on time.  We are moving out of state, and needed to get rid of quite a bit of stuff before the Christmas break, I was worried that we wouldn't be able to get rid of all the junk in time before any new renters came around to view the property, but they got the job done! Since we are moving out of state, we had a strict budget on what we could spend on the junk haul away, Juan was very helpful and offered to meet our needs in the best possible way. I appreciated his honestly and willingness to help. They were both so kind, and courteous and they were speedy and SUPER efficient. The haul away was clean and quick, I really couldn't be more pleased!<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The service I received from 1-800-GOT-JUNK was first rate!  The team of Jackson and Gabe were very professional and efficient at carrying out all the items we needed moved.  It was amazing just to watch them lift and fit it all in their truck.   I'll use the service again.

On the next generation of Got Junk trucks, add a lift gate.<//Review>

Craig and Kevin helped remove junk again for us today, in the rain. Such a fun crew. Helpful, fast, thorough. It’s a pleasure to get rid of stuff with their help.<//review>< user_id>

Because of them going above and beyond with loading and cleaning my space, not only will I be using this company again, I am going to tell all my friends and family that you guys are definitely the way to go.

<text>Why did I wait to call??? It was so easy. The workers were professional, on-time (very important when living on the Central Coast where time is determined by the quality of the surf conditions that day), efficient, and professional. I was given a quote before the work was started that I felt was fair and reasonable. They moved my living room furniture and bedroom set to remove two large, heavy area rugs I'm replacing and put the furniture back; and made sure the furniture was arranged to my satisfaction. They cleaned up all the junk piles I'd stacked around the house. The call center answered all my questions and were very accommodating the three times I called to reschedule. While I hope to never accumulate that much junk again, I won't hesitate to call them next time.<//text>< pictures>

When the company I worked for had trash that the city was giving a hard time to pick up, we called 1-800- got- junk and they were no hassle.  Showed up on time and very curious and professional. If you want a job done right contact these guys.  As for the city beware,  if you don’t clean up your act you have a company out there that no how to do their job and yours.< /review>

<review>The gentlemen that helped me out were just great. Arrived on time and got rid of it all in record time. The prices are a bit high. But the with the time it took, the courtesy and friendliness they displayed it was well worth it.

I had never used a junk removal service before, so I didn’t really know what to expect. It was easy to book the appointment online, and then equally easy to reschedule it when my plans changed. Then on the day of the pickup, today, I got another call a 1/2 hour before their arrival so I didn’t have to wait around at the location for the whole 2 hour window. They arrived right when they said they would, quickly assessed the job and gave me a quote, and quickly and easily removed everything with no help needed from me. They were courteous, quick, and efficient. I’m SO happy to have the junk out of my life, and couldn’t be more pleased with my experience. A+, would definitely use again.< /text>

My experience with 1-800-junk could not have been better. I had an apartment full of furniture and things to dispose of and didn’t know how I was going to get them out. The two men that came to help me were extremely helpful and made it affordable for me. They were friendly, positive, cheerful, and did an excellent job. I couldn’t be happier. I thank them so much for making my life easier!!!</review>

I am so pleased with the job that Daniel and Gavin did. They were courteous, explained charges prior to beginning work and then removed the items I requested with much care. They were careful not to damage walls, carpeting and doors. They worked with precision and did not waste any time completing the job. I would gladly use them again. Thankyou!</text>

It was so easy to book and there were plenty of appointment times open that met my crazy schedule.  The team was very communicative and the two young men who picked up my stuff were fast, efficient and really nice!  I would HIGHLY recommend this service.</text>

<Text>These gentlemen showed up early and were very efficient. They were great to work with and explained everything so I would know what the cost was up front. When they were done they swept the area and made sure that they had taken everything that I wanted gone. Would work with them again if I ever need.<//Text>< Name>

I am impressed with the professionalism of your team. I had used 1-800-got junk 4 times. They were always on time and always did an incredible job.

The last guys that I worked with are as follows:

Jamie
Angel
John
Joe
Rudy

I would highly recommended 1-800 got junk to any and all who ask.

Thank you,

Calvin Dix< /review>

<text>The reservation process was quick and simple, they called me 30 minutes before arrival and showed up on time, the employees were very polite and professional. They broke down an entertainment center and had it loaded on their truck in 10 minutes. Great service.

I couldn't have been more impressed with the two young men who arrived to haul away my old hot tub.  They were both friendly, polite, and hard working.  They more than took care of hauling away my junk, they even cleaned up afterwards.  I will not hesitate to use them again.</review>

He was friendly, pro & the price was reasonable. The work was completed quickly and done with care not to damage the premises. Highly Recommend!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

First thing was that the 2 guys that showed up were awesome. Explained how they charge, went through my stuff and gave me a fair rate. Just in case you don’t know, I didn’t but I did ask, they donate or recycle all of the stuff they pick up that they can. It’s a great service and I will be using them again.< /review>

<Review>This was my first experience using 1-800-GOT-JUNK.  I hired them to clean a piece of property that had been inhabited by some homeless people. As one can imagine, It was not the best of working conditions. Because of the great job done by Rudy and Walt I would not hesitate to use this company again.

If I could, I would give Rudy and Walt (10) stars.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c29dc68c40b289:0xcea452c99c630bde</gmap_id></record>

We needed things taken from our LA Office and wow were we surprised. I didn't think it was possible to get all our stuff cleared so quickly. The even threw out some of our trash on the way out.

If you need something like this taken care of, don't even debate between multiple companies. Just save some time and call 1 800 got junk.

Thanks Dre, John P and Keven, you guys were awesome!< /Text>

Not only do they walk you through the process, they offer solutions to efficiently get the job done.
Four times 1-800-Got-Junk walked me through the process of cleaning out a school basement.
Each and every time their team was efficient and professional from the start to the end of the cleaning process.  I can now breathe easier knowing that this major project is done.

<Review>So today isn’t just a regular day of cleaning, it’s the day I decided to get rid of decades worth of junk and to make it a little more special, I did it on my Birthday!! The boys came on time and we talked a little before the initial job. They were cool with me keeping some metal and them taking everything else. They helped me move around some things too to make sure my experience was worth every penny. Connor explained how the system works and both him and John did everything without any excuses or anything. They are both great workers and they enjoyed the music I played! We laughed, smiled and all got the job done. I tried helping but they both insisted I sit back and just give them direction. I’m really glad I booked this appointment, thank you John and Connor!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c29dc68c40b289:0xcea452c99c630bde<//GmapID></record>

<Review>This was the second time I’ve used GotJunk to clear out storage units after moving to Europe, and now deciding to stay longer.
They crew was right on time and worked  without hesitation with the heavy things I had in a second story stairs only unit.
Deondre, John P & Sven then followed me to another location for more of the same, except happily with a lift.
I’d definitely use  them again, but hope I won’t need to!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

My partner and I acquired a medical practice, but we absorbed the patients into our respective offices. After moving the charts and medical equipment, we were left with the daunting task of clearing out all that remained, such as waiting room chairs, cabinets; the list was endless. I called these guys, and it couldn't have been easier. First, we encountered some "unusual" language" that the landlord required on the certificate of insurance. They handled that with ease. Then came the hard part of emptying the office suite. Andrew and Rudy were exceptional. By the end of the day, the office space was empty. Old copiers, phones, desks; all were gone. Save your back, save your hands, save the planet. Call these guys.<//Review>

(LA Metro)

I rate their customer service 5*****  Stars!

The two gentleman, Connor & Han who came out this morning; by the way...  They called prior to coming AND was on time ready to work!

Both assisted me by doing whatever was asked cheerfully and made sure that it was to my satisfaction.

I will referer family and friends to this wonderful service.

Note:  One request to Corporate; your Drivers need lifts on the back of your trucks for the Heavy appliance items(Stoves, Refridgerators, Washers Dryers etc.) 💕

Like most families our garage was full of junk that had accumulated over the years. Today we decided it was time to clean out the garage, so we can actually use it like normal humans!!! I must say we could not have done it without Steven and Jorgen @ Got Junk!!
- These two gentlemen were so professional, so efficient, so nice, and more than anything they were able to work with us on price.
-We have managed to go through at least half of the junk in our garage, and we will be calling them back to help us get rid of the rest.
-Highly recommend this service!!! A+<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I am a landscape contractor and cleared a project site where various types of debris were removed - parts of a deck, hot tub, fencing, broken vases, dead plant material etc., etc, I would have had to call separate dumpster containers to haul away all that trash, plus permits to place them! There were not 'tons' of debris, but enough to be a problem for me.
I used 800-Got -Junk and was so happy with the service - they came out to give me a quote, said it would be two trucks - I agreed it looked at least that much. They arrived, went over what I wanted removed, informed me they will stop at the two truck quote - unless I approved any more.
They cleaned the site to the point it looked like nothing had been there!
The entire crew - Dre, Jaime, Craig, Conner, Rudy and John M. - were polite, humorous and worked quickly.
I will be using this service in the future for similar project sites.
