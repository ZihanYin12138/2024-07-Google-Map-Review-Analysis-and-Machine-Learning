I purchased a "classroom and hands on" driving lessons package at a reasonable price. My then 15 year son learned everything he had to know about driving. Once he was done with the online training he was given a certificate of completion which is required for a minor before they take their written test. He was well prepared for the written test and he passed on the first try.  He then took 6 hours of behind the wheel training with an instructor. They would pick him up and drop him off at home each day he had training. Today my son completed the last step of the process and passed his behind the wheel test on the first try  I once again hired EZ Will today to rent their vehicle for behind the wheel test, an instructor picked him up an hour before and accompanied him to take the test. I highly recommend EZ  Will School!< /text>

<text>This school is very accommodating, helpful and positive. They know every student's needs, corrects mistakes costructively and calmly, and very patient. They are all professional, so timely with schedules, and communication is perfect, from phone calls to emails. I passed my behind the wheel test because they taught me everything I needed to. And I highly recommend this school to anyone who needs to go for driving school.<//text><user>108789860771588350849</user>< gmap_id>

The owner and driver instructor (Ken) was very helpful, professional and patient.
They make sure the students are well prepared for their driving test. If you need assistance the day of the driving test, they can help with that as well. I highly recommend this driving school to anyone wanting to get their driver's license. Thank you EZ Will!</Text>

<Review>REVIEW 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

Honestly the best driving school you can go to. I had a basic understanding of driving before I started, but going through my lessons with EZ Will Driving school really put myself at ease.

Firstly, they go everything that will be on the driving test and have the most calmest and patient teachers. You also have 2 hours per session, which is a good amount of time to practice too. I personally had Cynthia, Calvin, and Ed for my practice runs, and they go through everything you need to know to be a defensive driver and a safe driver.

Secondly, on the dmv test service, they pick you up 1 hour before the test and go over any last minute trips and really have anything you need for your test, so you’re good on the insurance and having a licensed driver with you. I personally had Ken with me, and he was great. Totally patient and said I could pass and I did!

Lastly, they really want you to pass, so they give really good advice in every step of the way of your learning process.

Definitely recommend if you want some practice before your test or to use on your test date!< /Review>< pictures>

All of the instructors I had during my courses at EZ Will were on time, gave great instruction and helped me feel comfortable driving behind the wheel. A couple of friends recommended I go to driving school before taking my test and told me about EZ Will. I’m so glad I took their advice and took these classes. Passed my test on the first try but even more, I feel confident getting behind the wheel. Recommend for anyone looking for courses on driving.< /Review>

Honestly, this school is amazing! I was able to learn so much from 3 classes with them and they took me to the DMV, practiced an hour before, which all allowed me to pass my driving test!!!! Also special thanks to my instructor Mrs. Cynthia, who helped me out during my 3 classes and continuously believed in me even when I didn’t, and Mr. Kenny who took me to the exam and helped me practice and gave nothing but encouraging words. Overall, it was an amazing environment to be taught in and this school is amazing in general! 100% recommend!< /review>

I heard of EZ Will Driving School on my sister’s alumni newsletter from her/my high school, Junipero Serra High School (I am currently a senior). When I first walked into the school, everyone was following safety precautions by wear masks and having hand sanitizer and Mr. EZ Will and the staff was very nice. Also. cars were kept very clean. For my three days of lessons ( I had the 6 hours behind the wheel), I had Mr. Ken as my instructor. He was very calm and patient with me. By the end of my last lesson with him, I was backing up pretty straight, parallel parking with less help, etc. Overall it was a great experience and would totally recommend going to EZ Will Driving School. Thank you so much to Mr. EZ Will, and Mr. Ken !</review>

So first off, it’s very important for those of you considering this driving school to understand they aren’t LGBTQIA friendly. I’m part of this amazing community and they did not respect my pronouns. Another thing, I paid 6 hours of driving lessons including the dmv service and they hardly taught me anything! The first instructor I got was very rude and very unprofessional. Disrespected my pronouns, consistently kept touching the wheel, horrible greeting the first time we interacted , and taught me nothing. She even had the audacity to smoke near the car while we were waiting for “another student” which is unsafe to have another student in the same car with the instructor during these times (COVID-19). They did not mention this to me whatsoever I had to learn after I took my first lesson! I called and complained they didn’t seem to care much. I got a second instructor who was another individual on the next lesson. The instructor was okay, taught me more then the first individual and respected my pronouns.I didn’t have him long unfortunately. They ended up giving me another instructor. When it came to the last instructor for the dmv, he was rude, he didn’t respect my pronouns, he didn’t care about me as a student whether I passed or failed. He was also speaking to random people at the dmv the whole time I was waiting to be called to take my behind the wheel test. Unfortunately I failed my test on the first try even after 6 hours of lessons paid. Even on my way back home disappointed, this instructor did not care or encourage me they just didn’t care. I didn’t learn much the instructor made me uncomfortable and did I mention they’ve also discouraged me? Yes, they have favoritism. I highly recommend another driving school. ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT THING THEY DO NOT FOLLOW COVID 19 REGULATIONS. THEY WILL HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT IN THE SAME CAR AND DONT EVEN SANITIZE THE CAR LIKE THAT!!Stay away from this one it’s definitely not worth your money and your effort nor your health! Good luck I’m looking into other driving schools at the moment!<//Review>

Best driving school!  My son enrolled in the 6 hour behind the wheel course and the instruction was excellent.  They really helped him to understand the rules of the road.  We also enrolled him in the DMV drive test where he was picked up an hour before his driver's license road test at the DMV and taken on the actual route before. He took the road test in the EZ Will vehicle while the instructed waited.  He passed with a great score and is now a licensed driver!  I highly recommend.  All 4 driving instructors were top notch. *Professional *On Time *Teen Friendly *Patient *Knowledgable</text>

Ask the instructors to be extremely tough for your driving lessons because you will be fully alert of their knowledge on the day of driver's test. Also, the pre-test driving with the school at the day of the test is really crucial to refresh your knowledge with the instructors and to prepare your nerve. I strongly recommend to sign up with EZ Will Driving<//Text>

I had the BEST experience here! They definitely set me on a path where I feel more confident in taking control of my life all because I simply learned how to drive! I’m ecstatic to be out on the road because I’m knowledgeable on how to maneuver correctly, especially around reckless drivers now a days. I was first taught by Beatrice who helped me calm my nerves tremendously and I even got on the freeway for the first time because of her. Then my last two days I drove with Maude. I recommend her to any potential prospect looking to take classes because she is one to keep it real with you. I was able to understand the rules of the road better because of her! She broke it down in a way that anyone will understand. Because of her I am 110% sure that I will pass my drivers test! So if anyone is looking to take lessons I highly recommend this place. They care about the students, they work very well with your schedule, and they share nothing but positive vibes! Good luck to anyone looking to taking lessons!! :)< /review>

I highly recommend the EZ Will Driving School
My driving test was to soon and i didn't enough time to practice and drive more to be ready to the exam,but thank god i did some research online and found out about this school and i didn't hesitate to call them which is what i did imediatly,the person who answerd my call helped me a lot and explained to me every pacages that they offer and i did book the 2 Hours with DMV service,and I booked an apoitment to practice 2 hours,i was called the day of my apoitment and my instructor  Everardo was there at time at pick up location
He picked me up and helped me a lot and giving me good adivices and he answerd all my questions and he was making sure that I understood everything that he was explaining,Everardo  was an excelente instructor,the day of the DMV exam My other instructor Angie Arrived at time to my location she waited for me and she was very kind and helpful before we start moving to the DMV she talked to me and asked me if i have any questions and of cours she did answerd all my questions and explained clearly everything that i need to follow to pass my test and i was carfully making sure to do everything correct,we did practice again 1 hour before my exam
after that we arrived to the DMV office she helped me with the whole process and she suported me a lot to pass the driving test I wnt on my drive with my instructor we did about 15 minutes drive and everything went well,now I'm able to drive myself without waithing and wasting my money booking rides and arriving late to work,and this is my first try with EZ WILLThe classes also gave me peace of mind and put me at ease while taking the test. I was able to pass on my first try. school and i passed it.
Thank you very much EZ WILL team  especially Angie & Everardo i really appreciate it ,everything was excellent.
I highly recommend EZ WILL Driving School for pupils of all ages! His prices are incomparable and his experience speaks volumes.</Text>

Your 6 hour ends up being 5 hours because they like to spend time in the office trying to engage in pointless conversation. Didn't get a lot of training because every time I get a different instructor and they have different ways of teaching you the same thing. Had to pay another driving school for highway lessons even though it was sup7to be included in the 6 hour. I believe these reviews are bought<//Review>

I’m having the most frustrating experience with this driving school. First of all the front desk staff is so rude and clearly have a lack of knowledge about the program. Also the lack of professionalism, to cancel a behind the wheel training session, the first one, 2 hours before the sssion is to begin is totally unacceptable. On top of that to advise the earliest reschedule is a week away. I don’t understand how you own and run your own business but never seem to be available or reachable phone. I will not recommend this business.<//text>

Took the six hour course. Had Taja as an instructor. Very helpful at explaining everything and helping you calm down if you're nervous. He also made it very fun and not a rigorous task. Would definitely recommend this school to my friends and family.</text>

The tinna lady had lots of favorites. She was very impatient with me while teaching and told me that I’ll never get my license to drive. I ended up passing the test on the first try, both with the permit and behind the wheel. Why don’t you curve your enthusiasm next time miss tinna 👍🏽< /Review>

Miss Tinna is the best!!!! She gave me so many tips and encouraged me not to be nervous or afraid. I passed the DMV driving test thanks to her and I recommend her to anyone who wants to pass. She even told me I would pass before taking the test since according to her I was ready! Driving is not at all hard you just need the right instructor to guide you. EZ will driving school is the best. Prices are great as well as the instructors and staff. Thank you!!!!!!!< /text>

Taja was a good driving instructor. He helped me work on my turns a lot. He wasn’t getting frustrated with me. My turns were the hardest part of driving but Taja helped me out on that. Curtis was a good driving instructor as well. He helped me a lot on my turns.</Text>

In GoodWill driving school you have some of the best instructors to teach you. They are cool, very patient and help you clear the DMV tests without any hassles.
They are very punctual to pick you up for the class, prepare you very well to take behind the wheel tests in the DMV. I would definitely recommend them for classes.
The best part, they give the best rates in LA.
Keep up the good work.

<Review>Great school, great teaching. And it's the best price i could find in Los Angeles. I had Ken, he was very calm, and he gave me soooo many tips and small things that not only would help me pass the test, but also to be a great driver in general. He would critique me, of course, but never raised his voice or made me feel uncomfortable. I may a little biased now, but i highly reccomend EZ WILL over any driving school.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

It is great to be bilingual, but to only speak your native language AND work with the public is not fair to the customer and sets up for an uncomfortable exchange between two people about food. To have to repeat "Onion bagel " 6 times and then have to translate the word "Onion" to get the correct bagel is TOO MUCH for a donut shop at 4 am...... But if that is your new business model ... Good luck.<//text>

Went this morning with my mom and it was a nice surprise... You would think that a donut shop in the middle of Compton would not be as good as it actually was!! From the street it looked dirty due to trash on the road and surrounding area but inside it was real clean and the staff was super nice!! Coffee was hot and the donuts were delicious!! The selection was great too...< /Text>

< review>
Sandwiches are alright but the problem is when you ask for anything on the sandwich or if you even want to chnage it, the employees seem to have a fit. They act as though you are ruining their lives just to make the Sandwich the way you want. I can also see their station and equipment is unsanitary as well. Ive been here 3 times and each time its the same attitude from each employee. Also I do not speak Spanish well due to the fact that I am not Hispanic. I try to get some Spanish words in to help the girls but they treated me even worse because I used mostly English to make my order. Very unprofessional.</review>

<Review>I love this place. It's small and cozy and it's located right next to the middle school. So when it's dismissal time, it gets pretty busy. Otherwise, you can get in and out pretty fast.
My go to is the Black Forest bagel sandwich served hot. It is so good! The donuts here at good as well.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2cb5f3b70bbc7:0x76e71218cc8b3829<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

< text>
I went here with a few of my friends around 1 am because we had a major craving for donuts. Since this was 24 hour, and close by, we came here.
The overall experience was not that great. As soon as we walked up to the window, the only employee working looked very disappointed to see us. He wasn't very friendly and it took him a while to understand what we were asking for.
As someone who works in retail, I understand that no matter what type of day I'm having, I have to give every customer a decent experience. So it bothered me that this employee did not care to make us feel welcomed.
The two stars are for the donuts, cause they were really good and crispy. So good.<//text>

My husband went to the window and it took her a long while to get to help him and was very rude dis not even care and ignored as he asked her why she disnt tell him he had to go to the window! This place needs a better management and new employees! Seems like they are miserable and dont like their job!<//Text>< pictures>

Wtf!?! Third he was talking about how he hasint slept yet busting an all nighter? Then after I chose my doughnuts for my dozen I go home open the box and it was completely all the wrong ones, and the doughnuts were all dark brown, hard, and nothing about it was soft my kids started throwing them around and I ended up tossing the whole thing...smh!< /Text>< Pictures>

Very clean and organized throughout the store. Prices are perfect compared to other locations or online. Many well known brands of shoes all the way to scrubs. Whenever, my wife needs new scrubs we always come here. Employees are very friendly and always helpful. Also, they sell maternity scrubs which is a great bonus. No need to wait for weeks when ordering them online. Support small local business by coming here.< /review>

<Text>Today I went into Nurse Boutique of Visalia, Ca to inquire about a refund that is due for being overcharged. This is my 3rd time coming in and nothing has been resolved!!! I was told that the manager can’t call me because she’s off the clock.... Well please tell me what she’s doing while she’s on the clock because this has been an issue for 3 weeks! Still waiting..</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went in this morning the lady was very RUDE!! I felt like I was bugging her when I asked for help. She kept directing me to the more expensive items than just helping me with the items I had. Would never go back or recommend that place.. customer service is everything!<//Review>

Usually there is immaculate staff, but on Saturday March 14th around 2-3 pm the sales assistance had an unacceptable attitude. Wouldn’t provide help, or details about when new shipments will be in. This not good for business, for as soon as we walked in, we wanted to leave. The usual staff and management is great.</review>

Great selection of scrubs. Everyone is always very helpful and nice. Sam has great customer service skills and was very helpful in checking other stores for my size. I have always been happy with their selection and quality of scrubs.</text>

Avoid this place literally bought scrubs not to long ago and can’t even get my money back when I found them cheaper online? You guys are better off going all the way to Fresno.</Review>

<review>My Mom bought a pair of boots for me for Christmas from here, through Amazon. Everything was fine until I tried to exchange them for a half size larger. They said that they would not honor as exchange due to the purchase date and return date being more than 60 days... I get that, but I have a NEVER WORN pair of boots, that I cannot wear now. wasted money and they would not even TRY to work with me. This line is on their Amazon page... "We want you to love the shoes or boots you ordered from Nurses Boutique! If you are not happy with your order for any reason, you may return your merchandise for a refund or exchange." Well i am NOT happy and now my mother wasted $155 for nothing. Thanks Nurse's Boutique for showing us your great customer service skills and standing true to your word!<//review>< Pics>

This store is packed to the gills with this different scrubs selections. We work hard to get exactly what you're looking for and have pretty reasonable prices compared to the stuff online. Biggest drawback is there are no returns only store Credit. Really difficult to find the first time.</text>

<username>Kevin Morrison</username><text>cluttered , what is wrong with your pricing, i tried to buy some scrubs and every pair was a different price, then i was told its because of the size ok i can buy that but then still every price was different one 2x was 24.99 the next color 2 x was 31.99 then the same color 2x was 26.99 i was so confused and i felt like i was being price gouged,  they did call the manager and then i was told i would have to put a deposit down and the manager will get back to me on the price, i needed them now i told the people, there answer, this is the only way.   this is the way you lost a customer, this is the second time i have had this issue with visalia store< /text><UserId.>117215579150795198989</UserId.><Rating>1< /Rating><gmapID>0x80952f2ff357168b:0xf20c38fa74c6bbe5<//gmapID>< Pics>

I came in with a broken hearing aid. As I am deaf in one ear, the “good side” is crucial.  My past experiences with taking broken devices to other offices informed me that I would have to wait a week or more (pre-Covid)for the device to be repaired by the manufacturer. I was sure I’d be without for a couple weeks. To my great surprise and relief, Greg was able to repair the hearing aid right in front of me.  It was clear that he knew exactly what he was doing. I was so happy to be “back on the air” when I left the shop.  I’m grateful and pleased with the experience. 5 BIG stars!<//text>

I felt very welcomed and I felt in good hands with Doctor Gregory Novall. He was very informative and explained everything to me and how I can resolve my hearing issues. I am very thankful I found this facility and would recommend to everyone with hearing issues to come here.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Just moved here from another state and needed hearing aids.  I was in great need as my old ones broke.  Gary was so nice and so was the sweet girl at the desk.  Was suprised left that day with new ones.  My last ones I had to wait till they were ordered.  I am so happy to hear once again.  He spent along time explaining the use and I am so happy I can hear tv and on the phone.  My daughter was also happy that I could hear and she didn't have to say things over and over.  This office rocks.<//review></record>

<text>After struggling to hear for sometime, everyone wearing a mask tipped me over the edge...it was time for hearing aids! A co-worker, another nurse, had recently obtained hearing aids from Connect Hearing and suggested I go here. I have not been disappointed and cannot say enough good things about the quality of my hearing exam and Gregory’s thoroughness and professionalism. Love the Phonaks!</text>< user_name>

My fiance went into the office and had a hearing test done
We really liked the office and the atmosphere. The receptionist was really nice. Gregory who administered the hearing evaluation was excellent! He  took his time in explaining the test results and helped us with hearing aids. He consulted and had feedback.  He was professional and knowledgeable with a sense of humor.  I would definitely recommend this establishment for anyone who has issues with hearing.  Glad we were recommended!<//text>

<review>I was very happy with my whole experience. Gregory was very patient and very helpful at explaining everything to me. No one really looks forward to admitting they need hearing aids but I find I am so happy with them. I highly recommend that if you think you have a hearing problem, that you make and appointment.  I wish I had gotten them sooner.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Having worn hearing aids now for 36 years, I have to say that Greg is a very caring, compassionate hearing aid specialist.  I relocated to the desert back in March and my previous hearing aid specialist is now three hours away.  I had been having problems with my hearing aids for several months and Greg solved the problem in two visits.  He took his time and really made me feel he cared about me and how well the aids functioned.  I highly recommend Connect Hearing in Palm Springs.

Thank you for working me in your busy morning schedule to replace a part on my hearing aid. From the phone call to the office visit,  both friendly and professional. I'm new to the Palm Springs area from Los Angeles and will definitely be following back with this business for my hearing needs.

<review>I had a great experience here, I was diagnosed with genetic hearing loss over 8 years ago and was given a hearing tube to help but that did not work and my hearing loss has only progressed. I am worried to be in public places, but was reassured by the level of cleanliness and seeing that no patients are not sitting in the waiting room.

Gregory is very kind and had my hearing aids in the office within a week after ordering them, he taught me how to care for them (cleaning, battery changing etc) and program them so that I do not walk around squeaking and he connected it to bluetooth for me. YES BLUETOOTH, I no longer have to use my headphones to listen to podcast or music, I can also press a button on the hearing aid to answer phone calls. I was worried about getting hearing aids and how bulky they seem to be, well modern times have them being small and very unnoticeable.

I was overall pleased with the service and care here. I have IEHP at the moment because of not working much due to covid, I was not treated poorly at all. I told my PCP who referred me here at the quality of care and how happy I was with the office along with my mother who has a hearing aid.</review>< name>

We had an amazing experience. I took my father in-law because his hearing aid broke. Not only we were able to get an appt. fast enough but we were able to borrow a hearing aid while his was ordered. He really cares for his patients and I would recommend Connect Hearing in Palm Springs to everybody.<//review>

7/16/2020 Mr Novell has helped me again my  right side hearing aide broke when playing with my grandson. I called him and told him how it was broken ( the wire had been pulled out from the unit,he told me to come in and he would fix it. Not only did he fix it right there but did a full check on both aides and found one with a problem which had to be sent to the manufacturer of the unit to be fixed. One week later I received my corrected at no cost and Gregg even gave me a loner while mine was being repaired again at no cost to me. This Gentleman not only knows his work but is caring and honest.<//Review>

< Review>
Recently my mother needed a hearing aid replacement. Because she has Alzheimer's, and had just suffered a fall, I was not able to take her into the office to have the hearing aid fitted. Erika and Gregory were kind enough to allow me to pick it up and take it to my mother. It fits well, and now my mother is not only able to hear better, but she may also experience a slight improvement in her balance. I truly appreciate their accommodating us in the interest of my mother's safety. They are caring and kind, which makes the care-giving easier to manage. Thank you!< /Review>

<review>Usually a trip to the hearing aid store is a pain!  You just want your hearing aid fixed but first they want to test you and then try to convince you need something better and more expensive.  Erica ar Connect Hearing  realized immediately the reciever to my hearing aid had gone bad and replaced it in just a couple of minutes. She was pleasant, no nonsense and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. I'll be back!!!< /review>< user_id>

<text>I recently relocated to Palm Springs and needed new hearing aids. I went to Connect Hearing and met with Greg.  I was very pleased with his office and purchased new phonak  hearing aids.  Love the new hearing aids,  in particular the blue tooth connection with my phone and even to you tube.
Also,  Greg does not run a purchase and goodbye operation.  He scheduled follow up appointments to make sure all was working well.    I would have no issue recommending Connect Hearing.<//text>< Pics>

Erika, the receptionist, was the most helpful and kind person. I went in to ask how to repair my Phonak hearing aid as the part holding the battery had fallen off. Even though I had not bought my hearing aids from them, she gave me the spare part (with the button), put it in the aid, and provided me with a pair of batteries, all for free. Then when the audiologist came out and saw my dog he offered me a treat for him, and I am not their client. Really nice people and very knowledgeable.<//Review>

I have been helped by Connect Hearing in Palm Springs for the past 2 1/2 years and I can only say that the knowledge and help they have given me is nothing short of miraculous!
I have a crazy schedule for someone who is supposed to be retired, but their ability to somehow fit me in at the last minute is unbelievable. And extremely kind.
My thanks to Greg, HCP, and Erika, PCC for their caring and professionalism!</review>

<Review>I recently bought a pair of hearing aids from Greg & Erika from the Palm Springs office.  The personalized service that I have received from them both is outstanding.  This is my first pair of hearing aids.  Greg guided me as to which pair was best for me, and my budget.  I highly recommend this office and staff.   Thank You....  Don Soja, Palm Springs.<//Review>< pics>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Received a complementary hearing test earlier today. It's been years since I've had one done and I'd been wanting to get a test just because I'm older now and I want to be proactive about my health, including hearing. The test was thorough, using modern technology. Erika and Greg are professional, kind and efficient. The entire process was no-pressure and aimed at giving me valuable feedback. I brought a someone with me (who was also tested) and received a very nice referral gift. I recommend them highly.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80db1b9e94cc93cb:0x1741a47f193b0c1e< /gmap_id><rating>5</rating>< time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I have been very impressed by everything about my experiences with Erika and Greg at Connect Hearing in Palm Springs, Ca. I was referred to them by my insurance company when it was time for me to have my 10-year old hearing aids replaced. Greg is always very courteous and patient with me and makes me feel comfortable when I visit. He is very knowledgeable and keen on interpreting my sometimes vague descriptions of what I am experiencing with my new hearing aids and does a good job evaluating my situation and making the appropriate adjustments. This is a rare talent and Greg seems to have it! Stop by and visit them the next time you are in need of anything related to you, or your loved one’s hearing. You will not be disappointed.</Text>< Time>

Stopped to repair my hearing aid & decided to have a hearing check  Tiffany offered the latest Phonak so advanced from the first set I got 4 years ago.  Greg did the final fitting and contacted me several times for follow up.  Erika at the front desk assisted me with the Care Credit application.  Very pleased with the Palm Springs location and my new hearing aids.< /text>

< review>
Gregory is very helpful explaining the differences in hearing aids and fit my mother to a new set of hearing aids.  These new hearing aids are absolutely great. These new hearing aids connect to the tv so that we no longer need the tv blaring just so that Mom can hear it. Now the whole family can watch the news etc in a normal fashion and still carry on conversations.

This store is super helpful including the young lady at the front desk.  I cannot tell you how nice it is to work with pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable people such as these.  I give this store 5 stars based on multiple appointment here.<//review>

The comp hearing test really opened my eyes to my hearing loss. Dr. Greg was so helpful. I couldn't believe I got two hearing aids, one for each ear, for free to test for a week. We went through all of the products and found one in my budget range. I highly recommend Connect Hearing in PS.<//review>

Gregory is very knowledgeable and answers all my husbands questions. He is patient and never rushes him. Erika is very nice and also very knowledgeable.  She speaks very clearly which is extremely important when communicating with hearing impaired patients.  Highly recommend Connect Hearing to anyone.</Review>

<text>I wanted to have my hearing checked and was referred to Connect Hearing by my doctor.
The day I spoke to my doctor I received a call from Ericka at Connect Hearing.  I made my appointment and found out officially how bad my hearing was (not a "get your hearing checked" call from a friend :-) ).
I ordered my hearing aids that day and received them the following week.  And they were covered by my insurance!
Everyone in the office is very courteous and professional  and Greg is very competent and extremely helpful in every way.  He helped me sort out my hearing aid options and answered every question I had (and the ones I didn't think of.)  Nothing was too much trouble for him including calling me while I was away in Mexico and unable to come into the office for my follow up appointment.
When I did get back into the office, Greg helped me with a battery problem right off the bat and then we went into seeing how my hearing aids were stacking up.  No problems there and no problems with Connect Hearing on E Palm Canyon Dr in Palm Springs!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Dr. Novall made my hearing test non-stressful and post-test evaluation comfortable. I had been dreading it and postponing because I didn't want to know as my family has been suspecting for a while now. It turns out that my loss is very small. I am not "normal," but close enough not to require an aid at this time. When I do, I will return to Dr. Novall because he made the experience less daunting than I feared it would be.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

You would think im asking them to do some manual labor or to put of there way for something other than Whats under warrenty.

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the terrific service I have received from the Palm Springs, California Connect Hearing office.  Specifically, Gregory Novall, the Hearing Instrument Specialist.  I have worn hearing aids for about 10 years now and have been to probably five other Hearing Specialists over the course of those 10 years.  At no time has any one of the other Hearing Specialists treated me as well as Mr. Novall.  What makes Mr. Novall’s service better than any other Hearing Specialist is:
•	Mr. Novall allowed me time to try several different levels of hearing aids before I made my final decision as to which ones were the ‘best fit’ for my hearing needs.  At the end of each trial week I met with Mr. Novall and we discussed what worked and what did not work for me and then Mr. Novall used his computer technology to verify the pros and cons while sharing with me the information he was getting from the computer information.
•	Mr. Novall checked my hearing in more than one manner and did not rely on just one assessment.
•	After I made my final decision and was provided my hearing aids, Mr. Novall called to be sure everything was working to my satisfaction.
•	Mr. Novall encouraged me, after about two weeks, to return to his office so he could connect my hearing aids to the computer and see if there were any adjustments he should, or that I would like, for him to make.  He then went on to set up another ‘check in’ appointment in about 6 weeks and explained that after that he would like me to check in with him in about 3 months.  My past experience, once I received my hearing aids, was to walk out the door and never hear from that office again.
•	At no time during this process did I ever feel like I was asking too much or taking too much of Mr. Novall’s time.  He has made me feel like I was his only client.

It is clear to me that Gregory Novall enjoys his work, knows what he is doing and cares very much about the service he provides to his clients.  I thank you, Gregory, for this wonderful experience.  I had no idea of the services I was missing over these past 10 years.

Sincerely,
Douglas W. Hammer</Text>

I have an old hearing aid which I wanted examined. Mr. Novell took the time to examine the devise and gave me expert advise as to what to do.  I will return when it is time to purchase a new instrument.  Maurice<//text>

< Review>
I first visited this service centre six years ago. I purchased new updated aids there two years ago. I have found the product to be exceptional. But the service far outweighs the product. I have lost one aid while in Canada and had a replacement within a very few days of calling the office. Upon returning south this fall I visited the office and had the aids checked and retuned. There was no wait time and the hearing instrument specialist, Gregory Novall, is very competent and really makes you feel that you are special to him and to the company. I would strongly recommend this company and this location to anyone suffering hearing loss, or anyone struggling with those old style megaphone aids. Jim Yuel, Palm Springs, Ca.</Review>

<Text>They've made a very cute a cozy outdoor dining area. Service was amazing, we were being checked on frequently and the staff were all so nice. It would be 5 star but it was a bit pricey for the amount of food you were getting. Nice for an anniversary or birthday dinner.< /Text></record>

Saturday night piano bar is best entertainment around. Singers of all styles captivate patrons without a mic. Pianist Ron Snyder is the bomb! You'll have a blast!</Text>

The semi private room was nice enough. I felt the food quality did not match the cost. It is a very small, cozy place. Wouldn't go back with so many other choices available at a similar price point.</Text>

<Text>This old school gem is tucked in to the northwest corner of Pasadena near the Eagle Rock border. The menu offers traditional Italian fare, and the daily specials are not to be missed. There is a full bar, with live piano during the latter part of the week. And, the Service is outstanding. In the three years that we have lived here, we have never had an experience which fell short of excellent. This has become our "go-to" local restaurant, and it is a pleasure to support this small local business.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Name>A C< /Name><review>My wife and I came here for dinner today. Upon entering, the two of us were seated at a table side by side (the other side only had room for a chair positioned for the next table behind). I saw someone who I think may have been the owner, who gave us what felt like a very judgmental look (perhaps as we were the youngest there?), but notably I have never commented on noticing something like this from any of my other reviews. I also noticed a paucity of interaction between waiters and patrons.
The food order was incorrect, we asked for the sauteed chicken with pine nuts but were instead given the sauteed chicken with lemon sauce. Partly as I wasn't expecting it, the lemon component was extremely overpowering for the chicken  dish, but I'm not one to have them cook up new food for any of the above reasons. Chicken was clearly originally frozen.
The lasagna dish was okay but tasted like something that came out of a Kroger box.
I was expecting more for the price point of Stoney.
The clams were tasty, and our waiter was very friendly, hence the 2nd star.</review><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<Text>This is an old school italian restaurant with a personality all its own. Clearly a favorite among locals with a loyal clientelle who the wait and service staff seem to know well. I have been here a few times and never had a bad experience with either the people or the food.< /Text></record>

A quaint restaurant off the beaten path with ample parking in their lot or on the back street.  Food is great and reasonably priced.  Service is exceptional and they have a private room that can accommodate 14 comfortably.<//review>

<Text>White table cloth gem tucked away by the Rose Bowl. Amazing restaurant with phenomenal staff. Patient, kind, and very helpful. This is where you go for some peace and quiet, maybe some light live piano. Menu is traditional but food is outstanding. Try their Stoney Point chicken if in the mood or some steak. Small parking lot with available valet on weekends I believe. Reservations recommend but not required. Have some class and enjoy!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>A really nice little spot. The dishes had amazing flavor. Even the bread they served at first was delicious.
Most of all, the service was great. Don't forget to order dessert. The pianist was just setting down to play as we were leaving. I'm sure that would have been enjoyable as well.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Delicious food, friendly staff and a live piano player. Favorite Italian place in LA now. Smaller and more rustic feel, this is a tucked away gem. I had the steamed clams and the lasagna bolognese special both very good.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I had dinner at this restaurant on Oct 27.2015. The service was great, and has an intimate atmosphere. My wife was looking for a restaurant to meet some friends for dinner and found this little gem. It's a nice place to go and celebrate a special occasion. There was a piano player who played some nice music, a combination of musical melodies.But  He played a little loud at times.which was a little annoying. Perhaps he could have played a little softer and keep it below dinner conversation. But its the first restaurant that I have been to in a long time, that was not so noisy and you didn't have to talk loud to have a conversation at your table.  Oh and the food taste good.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Superb! This is a hidden gem tucked between Glendale and Pasadena which survives not because of its visability but by its reputation. We were there early evening  on Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend. Everybody was out of town yet they were packed. The reason is simple: They serbe Mana, Food of the Gods! Nothing more I can say.</Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Stoney Point has some of the nicest people in the world working for them. I stumbled in here after walking three miles and getting hopelessly lost in Pasadena (I'm not an LA local) with a dead phone and no ride, and they immediately gave me water and a place to charge my phone. After hearing me out about my terrible night, I even got a ride back to my hotel from a friend of the bartender's (shout out to Reggie, I still owe you). I was having a terrible night and the people at Stoney's saved me from so much trouble. Will be coming back just to hang out next time I'm in LA.< /Review></record>

The waiter was very rude. He complained about the tip that we left. It was 20 percent of the bill.
Never in my life, has a waiter ever complained about a 20 percent tip.<//text>

< Review>
I was shopping in Chino Hills yesterday with my dear friend.  She loves B&BW’s so we went there , she got her soaps and I was looking at candles and this wonderful sales associate Niko just made my very normal shopping experience a wonderful experience.  He was full of energy, loved his job he was just a wonderful person.  In today’s mask wearing world it’s difficult to shine but Niko was amazing!  We will always ask for Niko when shopping there in the future.
Then adorable Taylor checked us out and was friendly and pleasant.
Thank you B&BW Chino Hills!<//Review>

Great store at a great location with great products. I really enjoy just shopping around inside this store and looking for things to make myself feel better. It is the perfect place to buy products for your body, face, and also to buy gifts.</review>

Came in just to browse and maybe use my rewards points and was so happy with the service! The staff was super attentive and very knowledgeable about all their products and promotions. The first staff member was great and asked me what kind of things I liked and matched me with the most perfect scent diffuser, succulents and crystals?! WIN! And it lights up!! At the cash register Laura was super sweet and patient even though the customer ahead of me was giving her a hard time. I’ll be coming back for my scent refills!</review>

Checkout person didn't ask for my email, and I didn't know to offer it to get exclusive deals on future purchases, now I'm put on almost $150 worth of points in app :_( Plus is, employees were friendly, and answered my questions. Even got my Hubbz to choose a scented men's lotion for himself!<//review>

Such attentive staff. Well stocked and always a pleasure to shop at this establishment. Always a great deal here and there. I always go for the hand soap deals but I thought I would change it up and take advantage with their candle deals. The aromatherapy line is truly the best. I love their pillow mist. Sleep collection is everything. Picked up a few candles and a new pillow spray which I can't wait to try it out. Definitely will retun again that's a promise for sure.< /text>

<time>1566674033103< /time><rate>5</rate><text>Sabrina, greeted me at the door and let us know about all the sales and everything they had. When i asked her about different candles to purchase that didnt have a super heavy pumkin scent she recommended some beautiful smelling candles. I remembered my friend had a candle but couldnt remember the name only part of it she went looking for it and eventually found one. It wasn't  the one my friend had. But she was so sweet and so amazing for doing that for me. She offered me a bag when i had lots of candles and she was ready to help with a friendly personality and a go to attitude. Even though it was later in the evening. It was so refreshing and nice to have someone help out like that! Sabrina is amazing! And so is this location all the lovely staff was so helpful and so sweet!</text>< pics>

I had tonight's special fish, crab and shrimp sauteed in white wine. It was delicious. Best dish I had in the restaurant by far. Their seafood was fresh and savory. Would have it again definitely<//Text>

<Review>Stopped in on a road trip for 'authentic Mexican food' and found ourselves disappointed in every aspect. No one to greet us or tell us to seat ourselves; extra ordinarily long period before ANYBODY came into the dining area or greeted us or got us anything. The food was bland & disappointing. They had lost their liquor license, so no margarita, and the service was deplorable. The two employees that we saw were pleasant enough, but inept. Would not recommend.<//Review><Name>kosenrufu39< /Name>< userid>

<Text>Don't order the vegetarian burrito unless you like just rice and cheese maybe tortilla. So much jiggly grizzle bits in the asada. And I got the shrimp burrito with 3.5 shrimp. (Update: I dug out two other shrimp from the remnants of the burrito) And then they said there was no chicken, and then there was a piece of chicken in some ones burrito. Burritos advertised with sour cream and guac, none to be found except for the burrito that requested no guac. The big red flag was that we were the only four people in that restaurant. Oh and I don't know what happened but their liquor license is suspended. Two stars for the delicious salsa and chips. And one for the really nice lady who brought us "food".<//Text><Date>1512710292137</Date><UserId.>118257274956345209152< /UserId.>< Pictures>

<review>Used to be a semi reg.  Now no way. Service great but food third world country style. I know someone who found a bug in her salad, the salsa always tastes like its been sitting on the counter all day, the chips were made last decade, I think the staff and the owner are locking horns.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Don't order the vegetarian burrito unless you like just rice and cheese maybe tortilla. So much jiggly grizzle bits in the asada. And I got the shrimp burrito with 3.5 shrimp. (Update: I dug out two other shrimp from the remnants of the burrito) And then they said there was no chicken, and then there was a piece of chicken in some ones burrito. Burritos advertised with sour cream and guac, none to be found except for the burrito that requested no guac. The big red flag was that we were the only four people in that restaurant. Oh and I don't know what happened but their liquor license is suspended. Two stars for the delicious salsa and chips. And one for the really nice lady who brought us "food".< /Review>

<text>Customer service is absolutely terrible, hardly anyone working, very empty and yet they still screw up on your order, for instance, they double charge you, a dinner for two people on a to go order cost $66.00, for just 2 chimichanga dinners, 2 side house salads, 2 side small chips and salsa. The whole meal itself tasted very old and stale, not fresh. You call to state they over charge you, they agree, but say sorry and that they would credit us money for next time, well, there is not going to be a next time, that's the last straw! Very sad, hope they go out of business soon. Please be warned and don't dine here, bad service, bad food, and over charging, probably to try and make up money for business they are not making, it's only going to be a short time before this type of business catches up to them to be shut down for good!!!!!!!<//text>< Pictures>

They lost their liquor license in March of 2017 and as of August 11, 2017 they have not recovered it. The food was good but the huge tequila bar seemed to be mocking us as we ate. Google should revise their details for El Tapatio.<//Text><Time>1502578828077</Time>< UserId.>

< Review>
I've been here 8 times and I'm always seated on the side closest to the restroom.  Usually I just accept the seat but I.asked to be sat somewhere else.  The owner told me that all the other tables were taken or on reserve. I stayed and watched several seats never given to anyone else.  They do this more than race and color. Its age if you are alone, all kinds of things.  I'm tired of being willfully blind for a desire that is really tired and pathetic when I.think about it. You never have the duck anyway.  The service wasn't good.either. Going to Shutters on the beach, real service.  Love a company that can diversify their rituals and ceremonies instead of utilizing old and outdated methods.  I GUESS SOME BUSINESSES HAVE NO OTHER LEG TO STAND ON. LOL< /Review>

<Review>Just yum, that’s all I can say.
The octopus was served with a delicious tamarind sauce, the smoked lamb rib was so very tender with a divine sauce.
They had me at the Oxtail bolognese when I saw it on the menu. It did not disappoint.

Told my husband I was sad it was just the 2 of us. There were so many other dishes that sounded so good that I wanted to try.
Guess we have to return a few times.

Highly recommend. Between the food and service I can assure you, you will want to return again too!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Gave me a serious upset stomach, I think either your water filters need to be replaced or there was some old food. Also, steak came out dripping with ‘oil’ which I’m guessing was a clarified butter mix of some kind? Anyway.... not good. Maybe that’s what caused it.</text>

The food is just ok. Definitely not good “price-quality”. I traveled the world having meat and I’ve had best food in so many more “low quality” restaurants in my life. Don’t spend $60 in a small piece of meat. It’s just not worth it.<//review>

Ordered the pre fixe dinner. The starters of cabbage, wings, and salad were all exceptionally tasty. The main course of sirloin and salmon were delectable. The sides of squash and potato wedges were perfectly complementary. Finishing with the desert of the peach tart with blueberries a la mode was the perfect way to end the meal.<//Text>

There’s a couple things at this restaurant that we’ve never had before,  one was, a kitchen appreciation tax. I’ve never seen this ever. The other was, Fermented jalapeño vinegar.
The oysters were served with a passion fruit mignonette.

They have a cooler of many varieties of steaks, differently aged from days, two weeks, to even months.

We enjoyed everything that was there but I felt that they were very proud of their prices.  It was loud, Nor did I think the service was that grand.

I WOULD probably go back for a cocktail or glass of vine but wasn’t that impressed on what they charged for their age steaks.< /text>

<user_name>Jo Dee<//user_name><Text>I live half a mile from this place in the Marina. Can't believe I only discovered it tonight. Imagine 'Meat on Ocean', bursting with more flavor, if that's even possible. All the accoutrements induce eye rolls. Now, rib eye? Was a bit on the tough side compared to Meat's. But full of flavor, you can't put your fork down. Lamb rib appetizers were perfect. As was our server Brian.< /Text></record>

In short, Charcoal is one of the best restaurants in LA. With a two-star Chef/Owner Josiah Citrin, you've got a menu filled with some of the most delicious, craveable food - all tinged with the flavor of a charcoal grill. Want proof? Start with brunch and their ridiculously addictive Charcoal Baked Potato stuffed with a poached egg, sour cream, and smoked Gouda. Sounds simple, but it's perfection. Ditto for the Smoked Salmon Benedict with a charcoal toned Hollandaise sauce. The house smoked salmon is spectacular. And if you've got a kid or a sweet tooth, order the Dutch Baby Blueberry Pancake that's served in a skillet with a side of  vanilla whipped cream and blueberry compote. It's guaranteed to disappear quickly.<//Text>

A more casual, but still hip spot, by the people that brought you Melisse. As the name implies most of the items on the menu are grilled or charcoal cooked. It's a little loud, it's a little cozy and it's a little expensive. Not quite a steakhouse, but as much as the menu seems to lean towards protein, the highlights and standouts are the veggies.

The coal roasted cabbage is a mainstay appetizer and for good reason. Fork tender but still has structure, paired with the yogurt, sumac, lemon; it is a simple but yet sophisticated dish. The roasted carrots had a slight, bitter char that was eased by the creamy and cool sheep ricotta cheese. The seasonal sunchokes were tender and ate like a cross between artichokes and a fingerling potato; the meter lemon scallion dressing had a good blend of umami and acidity.

The large striploin for 2 was 20 oz and perfectly cooked medium rare in the charcoals. A little under seasoned for my taste, but I suspect it was because of the optional sauces of house made herb vinegar, chimichurri, smokey BBQ sauce and house A1/honey mustard (not a fan of the last two).

Suggested attire is business casual, but it's by the beach so a little more casual than that is okay. Cocktails are $15, wine by the glass are in the ~$16 range, beers in the $8/9 range.

I can see the appeal and it's a good modern alternative to your standard, fancier steak houses. Will be back to check out happy hour which is 5:30-7:00pm nightly at the bar.< /text>

Great food, super vibe, really busy.  We tried Charcoal on the Dine LA menu.  What a great value.  We added a couple of appetizers just to try some more items.  Overall it was wonderful.  The Flat Iron Steak was as tender as a filet, but with a ton more taste.  The appetizers were a treat.  I loved the barbecued chicken drumettes.  The cabbage appetizer was a real surprise.  It is not often that I can say that I love cabbage.  My only negative was the fact that we ordered an extra butter with our bread, and they charged us $2.95.  When I asked about it, the waiter took it off our check without me requesting the removal.  Really smart staff, smart manager and great cooking.  Innovative, creative, high quality, a great dining experience.  I highly recommend Charcoal.</text>

It was solid BBQ food on the westside that will give Baby Blues BBQ a run for their money. The quality of the meat seemed better at Charcoal but it is on the pricer side but is justified by a lot of staff and great service. Before you can ask for another Marg from the bartender he is already shaking it up “I got you amigo, try this one!” I would recommend and I would come back. With tip tax it’s about $80 per person with drinks and good cuts of steak that can be shared.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVMs76QVxmvB2Fr2AkHC_YFNRyPMi0KENekqzQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrAYBKqCP2Ioy4jKyHcHupZfdPzhr5O9ELKMgF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFQYTczgFTWljXYSNXXhjG84uZUmPQNOI3cod7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4_ZoziPOBY9f6qvydZN2kEZsPmSQW3mJG357X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgvDdammDHD47B5rJkLedELqGQJlA7xZ-ujtCe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJcL9MfxSxuaC6-TxIDByZH5yIG5WJQVLjdAQb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFL4P9CB1dCmbSTdV46NqQh9Jcgqo6hM7AwIJQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjlrmBSgSoiNiEV2hXeORNk7acKbn3ob6EFtG6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<Review>I went to this restaurant for my birthday with my girlfriend. The food was very tasty. The side dishes (Brussels Sprouts and Chopped Salad) were amazing. Unfortunately, our waiter was a different story.  After taking our order, he barely paid any attention to us or checked on us to see if we needed anything else. Not even to see whether if everything was okay once the food arrived. Sadly, the only thing that made the service somewhat tolerable was the hardworking Busboy who went above and beyond his job duties.  At one point I asked the Busboy if he could get our server.  After few seconds of awkward silence he stated that our waiter had already gone home for the night.  This came as somewhat of a surprise since at no point prior to sitting down for dinner, during dinner or up until the point we were told that  the “Waiter of the year” had departed did we complain to him or had issues with anything).  At this point I asked for our check which was brought. The total (for just the two of us) was almost $300. Long story short, $350 later I asked for the manager and explained my experience and in return I received a half hearted apology.  Truth be told, from time to time I crave the Chopped salad but after the rude treatment we got I will not be going back. Again good food but not so good service.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUwM2scmJoyxyVSXOHa5LI_Vx8-TFetTi0_yoU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-Pl_i1Hz_yx9LLsE4c22raYgK14GH8MA7ZBW3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8ZRZEapXTbn7cbv5kS4CoEMt4dI_SKbqRZa7N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< date>

I come to this spot every time I visit LA. Try to get a reservation because it can be crowded, but I've had no trouble finding a spot at the bar. Place is fairly spendy, but you get what you pay for: Top-notch cocktails and wines with food you've never tasted before, especially if you like a charcoal smokey flavor. It's infused into just about everything. Go for a nice steak and don't skip on getting the chicken wings. Kitchen is open, so you can see right in and the atmosphere is elegant, but casual. Staff is great, too. I'll be back!<//Text>

My boyfriend ordered a burger to-go a few days ago that came with potatoes. Tonight, he ordered the same burger with a baked potato. When the food came out, the check said $14 additional charge. He asked the bartender why it wasn't included and he responded with "sorry man". Terrible customer service. My boyfriend ended up paying $33 for a burger and a potato. Complete waste of money and the food wasn't even good! Potato was so burnt he couldn't eat the skin.

<Review>No bad restaurant.  But little things can ruin the impression.  Poor quality napkins, the old and washed.  They leave a lot of fibers and dust on the clothes.<//Review>< Time>

We got new plates every course, the food was phenomenal and if you're willing to spend some money than you can get the best cuts of 35 day dry aged beef.

Exceptional food here. We came here for a group lunch and they were more than accommodating to us and our guests. We were a group of 12.
Our waiter was very friendly and had great recommendations during our lunch.<//review>

My wife has been commenting for some time that she would like to try this place. I surprised her for our anniversary and made a reservation (place is always busy so make a reservation). We arrived on time and were seated in about 5 minutes. In my reservation I had mentioned it was our anniversary and my wife has Celiac disease. Everyone wished us a happy anniversary and there was even a cute card on our table. They also took my wife's food allergy seriously and seemed well trained to be aware.
The food is amazing and the service equally amazing and attentive.
This place is designed around sharing, a mistake we made not knowing. We had the ribeye, carrot and steak fries as well as the strawberry fields and old fashioned drinks and the apple crumble (which was gluten free). Everything was so good!! Special props to Sara our great server who was funny, friendly and just all around great.</review>

<text>Lana K is one of the nicest and friendliest servers I've ever had at any restaurant. The food here is really delicious. I am only giving this place four stars because my girlfriend and I paid $113 for brunch. We each had one entree and bottomless mimosas each and one coffee. So it is really good but it pricey.< /text>< Pics>

Being walking distance from Venice Beach is ideal and they do have valet parking if you need it. The staff are genuine and attentive and the food is great. They even make their ketchup in house with their own secret recipe which reminded me of the ketchups I used to have growing up in Europe. The portion sizes were alright as well. I sat at the bar and the bartender was great, always filled my bottomless drink when my glass was empty and new the food menu as well. Definitely a great spot to grab a bite to eat< /review>

<Review>This is the second time I've eaten here and it just keeps getting better. This time I visited for brunch and had an amazing paleo meal.

Gluten and grain free waffle with ham and eggs. It was to die for. My sister ordered the stuffed baked potato and ended up ordering an extra waffle for herself after tasting mine.

The atmosphere is great, very Venice. The food is amazing and creative.

The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend popping in for a meal. Even just a drink at the full bar is worth a visit.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb2e705c8d5f:0x5a4d7eb59b884fba</gmap_id>< pics>

We arrived on time and were seated in about 5 minutes. In my reservation I had mentioned it was our anniversary and my wife has Celiac disease. Everyone wished us a happy anniversary and there was even a cute card on our table. They also took my wife's food allergy seriously and seemed well trained to be aware.
The food is amazing and the service equally amazing and attentive.

At first, when I saw the price I was completely shocked but after the FIRST & LAST bite it was absolutely INCREDIBLE!! I ordered the THREE EGG OMLETE and ate every LAST BITE! you really can’t go wrong with anything here! Take a walk around and see what other people have ordered so you know what looks good but once again, YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH ANYTHING! Will definitely be back here in the near future for BRUNCH! DELICIOUS!<//review>

<Text>Not a fan of writing bad reviews as I support local but the beyond poor service level, treatment from the hostess stand along with the poor food quality leaves me no choice.

Just a suggestion, don't by two desserts u less there are at least four people to share them. They are huge! At almost $13 I guess they should be though. The place was hoping on a Tuesday night so we sat at the bar. The servers and the service was great and the environment was energetic. Great vibe as everyone seemed to be enjoying their food and experience. I would definitely fine there again.<//text>< Pictures>

Right from the start we were greeted warmly and taken to the table we reserved. The food was spectacular and our waiter was more than happy to describe the items on the menu, as well as the daily specials.
We had the sirloin and scallop entrees, with the carrot and Brussels sprouts side dishes to pair. We were very glad we took his recommendations, as both side dishes were spectacular! The sirloin and scallops were perfectly cooked and paired quite well.
Overall, we were extremely happy with our visit and I can't wait to return when I am back in town!<//review>< name>

<Review>As an avid weekend BBQ host when I saw the concept for Charcoal my wife and I had to visit during our recent trip to SoCal.  The chef has done am excellent job combining flavors in new and unique ways.  Who knew you could make cabbage taste that good!

We had a chef's tasting menu that allowed us try  number of different dishes.  There wasn't a single dish we tried that wasn't excellent.  The wagyu beef was my favorite.  The chef was able to create an excellent flavor without drowning out the natural beef.  The char around the exterior was consistent and made me jealous!  I wish I could create that same consistency with charcoal at home.  The only downside is that now I need to step up my game at home in order to live up to the expectations he created.<//Review><date>1565548069359</date>< userid>

Solid food and a local spot for us. However myself and many locals feel the prices and value just are not there. Should have better pricing off peak hours and for locals to be more of a neighborhood spot imo instead of trying to capture top dollar. Priced a little better and this would be a 4/5 star spot I’d be a regular at.</Text>

Omg! This place is great and the food is just amazing. I had the steak and eggs and my wife had a breakfast sandwich, and we both had a French press coffee. The sandwich was dare I say perfect and the steak was just butter. I know it sounds like I'm hyping this up but real talk it was really great food and the atmosphere was very chill. Shoot out to our waiter btw (Kevin I think) he was awesome.</Text>

<Review>Ridiculously Good! Glorious even and then Fred Savage from "the wonder years" sat down next to us at the bar and I asked my wife if we died in the Uber ride over here because this place is just too good...
I could talk about the 190 day aged meat, or about the best carrots I've ever eaten, I could talk about the top notch service from a very cool and  culturally diverse staff. But I won't, once you go here, you can do all the talking..</Review>< pics>

All around excellent experience.  Very good service.  Orders cooked to perfection.  Both the duck and the bison steak ( particularly the duck, in my opinion) we're great as were the grilled cabbage, and the carrots.  Top dollar, but worth it.< /Review>

<review>I am into competitive BBQ as a hobby and travel for work so I stop at all of the best BBQ/smoking/grilling spots I can find as I travel. I accidentally wandered into this place and have simply fallen in love. The first day I went alone the chicken and chicken wings were so good I brought customers their the next night and bought the cookbook the chef made to learn from. Tonight I had the grilled peppers, coal fired steak and grilled cabbage. Each thing was better than the last with the cabbage being the surprise highlight. Every dish has been incredible. My only complaint is over eating from wanting to try everything.< /review>< pics>

AMAZING! Great cauliflower. Huge, delicious salad. Steak was pretty good, not worth $60. Very busy, reservations required unless you can find spot at the bar. They are very slow to check on you. They could use more staff.</review>

This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. My sister picked out this place on our first trip to LA and by the end of our trip, we cancelled our reservations elsewhere, we came back to Charcoal Venice for a second time.

The food is absolutely incredible and worth every penny. The first time we began with the cabbage and the second time with the bread and French butter. Both were outstanding. We had the skirt steak both times because it was some of the best we've ever had.

We both were extremely impressed with the staff, as well. They all worked together so well and helped look after each others tables. They were all so kind and so efficient. I've never seen anything like it. The manager was so on top of things and helped the staff out so much.

All in all, if you go to Venice, don't skip over this place. You won't regret it. Excellent staff and wonderful food. We will absolutely be back!< /review>

Went last night with my wife. We were willing to go for a while ... complete disappointment. Hostess and waitress were great, i give a 5 stars for the service without a doubt. However, food had no taste. We ordered the calamari & the wings to start (zero taste), the skirt steak was okay but the fries (no way they are fresh cut) and the sweet onions were terrible.< /text>

We had an amazing meal - 10oz sirloin, lamb sugo with pappardelle, and a side of Brussels sprouts. It was impressive and incredibly satisfying. The waiter was also very friendly and made us feel welcome. Overall great experience.< /Review>

<Review>Don't believe the hype.  This place should be a lot better, especially for the price. The food ranges from okay to pretty good,  but definitely avoid the steak.  I've had three different types of steak,  each on different occasions,  ranging from the cheapest to the higher end.  They were all woefully underwhelming and the meat itself lacks so much flavor it's hard to distinguish which was better.  Sure you can douse it in a sauce,  but having the meat by itself,  aside from the salt and admittedly nice charcoal flavor on the outside,  the actual meat is flavorless.  He needs to find a better source for his cows. I've grabbed a 3$ steak from a random grocery near big pine,  ca, sprinkled a bit of salt and pepper, slapped it on a grate over a fire, and it knocked the socks off the steaks I've had here. It's a shame because there's clearly a lot of effort put intro the food at charcoal, fire such little payoff.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2bb2e705c8d5f:0x5a4d7eb59b884fba< /gmapID></record>

<Review>We came to California for a week and loved it such on our first visit, we ended up going again on our last night. Service is wonderful and the hardworking manager makes sure everything is running smoothly, all with a smile on her face.

Overall incredible 👌 experience. For three people we ordered the mushroom and beet tartare starter, an arugula salad, roasted carrots with ricotta and a waygu 12 oz. The tartare was the only thing I didn't love immediately. It was very good but the beet overpowered the mushroom. The mushrooms gave a nice meatiness to the dish. Salad and carrots we're perfection. The waygu...our server asked us if we wanted to omit the sauce garnish. We were hesitant at first and then said to omit it. The sauce is already on the table so if you want to add it later you can. I recommend leaving it off. The beef was perfection at medium rare. Service 5/5 as well. Appreciate a good pro tip on pricey steak.< /text>

Simply perfect. Our server Rob set the tone with attentive service. The food was so good we ate well past fullness and didn't stop there: charred cabbage starter - never had such flavorful cabbage; duck - one of the best I've ever had; roast carrots - so many flavors; roast corn - sweet and citrusy, lovely spices, mmmm mmm mmm. The wine selection was interesting and reasonably priced. We had a table in the corner which made it perfect for a romantic dinner. Definitely coming back here, many times.</text>

<text>Very good meals. Very good service in spite of being quite busy on a Friday night. They have cork panels in the ceiling which helps dampen the sound fortunately, as it was - still borderline too loud to comfortably here dinner companions.  Chicken was delicious as we're great beens and carrots.  Go early or late when it's quieter.</text><gmap_id>0x80c2bb2e705c8d5f:0x5a4d7eb59b884fba<//gmap_id><rate>4</rate><user_name>Ken< /user_name><userid>103207788172650385314<//userid></record>

What a treat it was to dine here.  Wonderful food, well seasoned, beautifully presented.
Our group of four enjoyed venison tartar, collard green salad, brocollini, carrots - oh those carrots!, duck and short ribs, all of the dishes were above average flavor and presentation.  Thank you, Charcoal, we will be back!</Review>

This place is incredible. The service was impeccable, and the food was fantastic. Believe it or not this is a great place to eat if you're vegetarian. We had a few veggie dishes that were more inventive and equally as delicious as our meat dishes.</review>

<text>Just an amazing experience. Not pretentious. Just plain spectacular food and great execution. Potentially one of my top favorite restaurants. I got the chicken wings, calamari, lamb ribs and bread. I had everything with the vinegar and chimichurri sauce. Just crazy good. The wings and lamb ribs are a must. I died.</text>< userid>

Lovely recent addition to the Marina/Venice restaurant scene.  Food is served family style, including steak entrees (see pictures).  Recommend the prime skirt steak entree and arugula salad (which is too large for one person).  Top notch cocktail menu.<//Review>

The food was very good. Not only did it taste great but it was innovative. For example, I had the cabbage that had been cooked in the embers and it was delicious and unusual. I think that a lot of thought had gone into the menu. The portion sizes weren't bad for a restaurant with innovative food. The restaurant was well decorated and the staff were friendly. It was expensive though - expect to pay around USD 70 per person including tax and tip but not including drinks.< /Text>

Love all the other restaurants by Josiah Citrin.  Eaten at them often.
Also love all types of, American, Korean, Japanese, grilled/bbq meat. Over all the the food at Charcoal was flavorless, over sauced, and extremely over priced.  The cuts of meat were no where near the quality or variety of other grill/steak houses.  We had the most expensive aged beef which was not cooked as requested and had zero flavor.  Duck was over cooked.  The cabbage dish was vaguely interesting mostly due to the sauce. Mushroom dish was good.  Carrots so so.  The coffee was awful.  The wine was wonderful.  There was zero pacing of the meal. The service was decent  but over all the experience was a bad joke.  I've had much better meals almost anywhere.  Perhaps the other five star reviews never ate at any of Citrin's other establishments.< /text>

Charcoal has become a destination restaurant. We have friends who come here from Miami Beach, FL who make Charcoal their main destination. The restaurant's unique (and very pricey menu) offers charcoal grilled meats and vegetables.  Some standout side items: the char-grilled cabbage with yoghurt sauce, the smoked German potatoes with onions and mushrooms, the char-grilled carrots with yoghurt. The duck and chicken are very good, but the fish was too salty for our tastes. However, the MAIN reason to eat at Charcoal is the char-grilled red meats. The Skirt Steak, the Hangar Steak are delicious, and though some think the lean Bison Steak ($60) is THE reason to eat at Charcoal, we disagree. We have found the other red meats more satisfying and less expensive. If you like lemonade, they have a berry one with is also char-flavored. They also make signature cocktails. If you are into desserts and love Olive Oil Cake as much as we do, they make a very lovely one. But try the Chocolate Crisp Peanut Butter Cake. The Apple Crumb is also very good. All-in-all, Charcoal is expensive, but worth the spluge for a unique dining experience. The place is VERY popular; reservations are necessary, and you will be charged a No-Show fee if you make one but not everyone in your party shows up. This is now a common practice for high-end, very busy restaurants. The place is noisy, so it is not suited to a quiet romantic dinner. The best choice is for a group of six ppl to come and everyone at the table order something different to share. Wait staff is helpful and eager to answer queries.<//text>

I was underwhelmed. Given the pricey menu and extreme hype, I expected more, but got less. Furthermore, there are plenty of other very good restaurants in Los Angeles that are worth trying. Perhaps I've been in NYC too long, but I know that I can find better food at much more reasonable prices in Queens (specifically Astoria and Jackson Heights) and certainly in Manhattan. Save the money you'd spend on dinner here and fly to NY or try somewhere else in SoCal that is not so overhyped.    Just my 2 cents...</text>

< Review>
All I can say is that the skirt steak was unbelievable and so was the pappardelle.. wow. I would go here again if I could afford it (my family took me out). Excellent for people with peanut allergies because the chef is allergic to peanuts! So I felt very safe there. Staff clearly cares about giving diners the best experience, though one waitress kept apologizing profusely when she couldn’t remember the ingredients of one dish and I was like “lol it’s really ok”. Interestingly you can order water many different ways with ice inside, or on the side in a separate glass.</Review>

<review>One of the owners is a bully to his staff. Embarrassing to watch. He was even abusive to a few customers. A total punk who would get knocked on his ass in my neighborhood in New york, but I guess in California wimps like him get away with it.

Food not bad, not great. Nice looking room. with so much competition in the area there is not too much to warrant a return.<//review>< pictures>

<text>We had a great experience: every dish we ordered (cabbage,  mushroom tartare,  chicken,  beef, And the dessert- Smores, apple...) was excellent. Only word - excellent: nothing too salty,  nothing fattening > just perfect. I highly recommend it if you want a unique experience. Thank you.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<gmapID>0x80c2bb2e705c8d5f:0x5a4d7eb59b884fba</gmapID><review>Wowza! This is my second time ... this time, via Uber Eats. My first visit was spectacular, this one was too ... but a few things of note for both sides. I was hungry, so for a big order, I went right for the Lamb Ribs ... I might have to say they might be the best lamb ribs I've ever had! They had some very unique seasoning, I believe they were smoked, and oh so good .... they didn't taste like lamb at all oddly, but still, just delicious .... a little fatty, but that might be why they were so tender ... Next, chopped salad, most excellent, a lot of stuff in there, maybe too much, but very good, .... seemed like a healthy and crunchy choice of fresh stuff - not off the charts like the ribs, but good. THE STEAK! Hmmm ... most excellent, but I ordered it medium rare. I would recommend it medium. The steak is VERY marbled, which is good ... but with all that marbling, the fat and gristle needs to be cooked down a bit more than medium rare in IMHO ... it was a bit too chewy and fatty at medium rare. I heated it a bit more myself on my cast iron pan and it was much, much better at medium. It was a great piece of meat, but I would like a tiny bit more seasoning, if only just some salt, but again, good meat. The collards .... they were not as expected, most folks have them more old school, e.g well cooked down .... these were raw or maybe barely cooked, very good, but not what I expected. I would not have added all the bread crumbs and cheese, would have been nicer to have them a little more simple and light, delicious, but with the added things in there, a bit heavy. A couple of little nit pics, but all in all the food was outstanding ... order 2 orders of the lamb ribs, ribeye medium, and a few more dishes and you'll be a happy fan! I will be back again and even if by Uber Eats, "I'll be back"! Oh .... bonus points: I'm not always a fan of "steak sauce" but oh my oh my, their sauce, I think it's called J-1 (??), it was fantastic!!!! I nice tang of home-made goodness, I wonder if they sell it by the bottle??? It's that good. See ya'll soon, great work, delicious!</review>< Resp>

Only then might a highly influential community reconsider the place.  Until then, know that boorish Trumpian attitudes don't prosper in Venice. Peace!</Text>< resp>

<Review>We only went in for a quick bite to eat. Our server Sara was lovely and attentive and informative. She apologised for our long wait but we didn't really mind. We each had the sirloin steak. I had the smoked potatoes and my brother had the fries. I was enjoying the smoked potatoes until my brother tried one and said it tasted like it was cooked with hotdog water :( My brother said his steak was really good. My steak was only ok. It was cooked perfectly but the last third of it was super tough - even my steak knife was struggling to cut through it! I didn't want to spit it out so I tried to swallow it and almost choked lol. My brother sampled the local beer and I stuck with soft drinks. The charcoal strawberry lemonade and the root beer were nice. But the plastic straws were terrible! They completely split at both ends and became unusable. Overall, good food and great service.</Review><user_id>108970118690643065464< /user_id>< Pictures>

<review>The reviews are spot on.  I worked with the chef once.  Godawful experience.  Talentless hack.  Hires a chef de cuisine to do all the work and he takes all the credit.  Raging alcoholic that treats people worse than most people treat their pets.  It is comical to see him work himself into a tizzy cuz he has a horrible lisp and spitting problem.  Think Daffy Duck meets Porky Pig.  Surprised he is still around.  I thought the word was out on this guy due to the amount of restaurants he's closed.  Save the theatrics for celebrity chefs on TV.  This guy is a joke.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<rating>3<//rating><review>I have been here many times and I must say, as good as the food is, the hostesses are so unfriendly and uncooperative. We had dinner on March 31st. We asked for a certain table and were told that was reserved for 4 people (we were 2) and yet 15 minutes later, a couple came in without a reservation and was seated there. The other confusing thing is they say they open at 6 for dining but do not say the bar opens at 5:30 so when we got there at 6:10, the bar was full and they do not honour their happy hour menu at the tables. This last experience much sealed it for me and it's highly unlikely I will return.</review>< pictures>

Really excellent food, but stupid noisy.  I suppose it's a "high energy" atmosphere. Never understood the attraction of that, but again the food is underpriced for the quality, so we'll probably go back.< /Text>

Stunner on Washington Blvd.  Beautiful food, attentive service, and casual but sophisticated atmosphere makes this restaurant a must-stop for a nice dinner.  Namesake - grilled - meats, fish, and vegetable matched with modern cocktails (some nice interpretations of old school cocktails), an interesting, curated, mid-to-high end (but not steak house) wine list made our meal memorable.  Aged-35-day duck was pricey (and our server warned us that the although the portion size indicated a half duck, be prepared for a de-boned portion that may cause you to wonder about the near $50 you just spent) but - yes - worth it.  If the quality keeps up as the restaurant matures, will be a stalwart in what otherwise is a bit of a deadzone (and graveyard to many other restaurants).</review>

<Review>Amazingly delicious!  What a find.  The 21day aged duck is to die for!  Had multiple vegetable sides that were too.  Desserts? check.  If you consider the chef is a Michellin chef from  LA's best french restaurant, you would have to assume this is GOOD food, and you would be correct.  He happened to be in the kitchen the night we dined, which added to to great evening.  This will replace Gjelina as my go-to restaurant when visiting LA.</Review>< Rating>

We had to birthday  members at our table  and no dessert was offered  or even a happy birthday song? small portions shared family style. Overpriced for the amount of food you get and there were a bunch of hipsters that look like they were hunting for gluten free tacos.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1487882145780<//date></record></dataset><record>

From long time Venice resident and KCRW music DJ Tom Schnabel:

At my ripe old age not that many firsts happen, but last night was an exception. I was thrown out of a restaurant.
I was happy to see Josiah Citrin's (of Mélisse and Guide Michelin fame) new space Charcoal finally open on Washington Blvd. I even attended a community meeting last fall to voice my approval of this new high-end eatery, one of the few within walking distance of my flat.
While waiting near the bar for a table to open up, I was bumped and pushed by some stranger; I thought to myself 'what's up with that guy'. Then my friend Joe walked by him and, the aisle being quite narrow, his jacket brushed up against the same guy that had pushed me. The guy pushed my friend back in retaliation. My friend is not one to be pushed around, and a fight almost ensued.
Then the manager then came and asked us to leave. Turns out, the belligerent jerk was a big investor. And apparently he enjoyed his power, pushing people around at Charcoal. Even one of the hostesses told us he'd done the same to her. When we refused to leave, Charcoal's manager said he'd call the police.
Needless to say, this ruined our dinner and I don't plan on returning to Charcoal anytime soon. Just because you're a major investor in the new restaurant, that doesn't justify being boorish and rude with patrons like me and my two guests.
So we left Charcoal and walked next door to Le Cellier, a French-Vietnamese bistro that had a calmer, more welcoming ambience, and enjoyed a nice meal together.< /text>

Good food and service; a little pricey and can be hard to get into without a reservation on weekend nights. Try the carrots.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>From long time Venice resident and KCRW music DJ Tom Schnabel:

At my ripe old age not that many firsts happen, but last night was an exception. I was thrown out of a restaurant.
I was happy to see Josiah Citrin's (of Mélisse and Guide Michelin fame) new space Charcoal finally open on Washington Blvd. I even attended a community meeting last fall to voice my approval of this new high-end eatery, one of the few within walking distance of my flat.
While waiting near the bar for a table to open up, I was bumped and pushed by some stranger; I thought to myself 'what's up with that guy'. Then my friend Joe walked by him and, the aisle being quite narrow, his jacket brushed up against the same guy that had pushed me. The guy pushed my friend back in retaliation. My friend is not one to be pushed around, and a fight almost ensued.
Then the manager then came and asked us to leave. Turns out, the belligerent jerk was a big investor. And apparently he enjoyed his power, pushing people around at Charcoal. Even one of the hostesses told us he'd done the same to her. When we refused to leave, Charcoal's manager said he'd call the police.
Needless to say, this ruined our dinner and I don't plan on returning to Charcoal anytime soon. Just because you're a major investor in the new restaurant, that doesn't justify being boorish and rude with patrons like me and my two guests.
So we left Charcoal and walked next door to Le Cellier, a French-Vietnamese bistro that had a calmer, more welcoming ambience, and enjoyed a nice meal together.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Slow and unorganized hand held computer ordering system, food needs salt but no salt on the tables and no follow up service for us to ask for salt, food arrived warm and not hot.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent restaurant where hard to get into. Book better for 1 - 3 days. Everything is delicious, great service! Unforgettably!

Отличный ресторан, где трудно попасть. Бронировать лучше за 1 - 3 дня. Всё вкусно, отличное обслуживание! Незабываемо!< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very good food. Rich meat accompanied by a variety of sauces and homemade dressings. Well the entrances, maybe a little dark. High price, ok but this is Venice 😀

(Translated by Google) Highly recommended restaurant, especially for steak and fish dishes. Small map. Everything prepared over an open fire, hence the name. Very good!

(Original)
Absolut empfehlenswertes Restaurant, insbesondere für Steak- und Fischgerichte. Kleine Karte. Alles über offenem Feuer zubereitet, daher auch der Name. Super gut!<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very good food, but very expensive. Drink should be expected to be $ 80.

Valley Vape Smoke  Shop is awesome! They have great prices and they have some refreshing vape juice flavors like True Gold and Real Money. These are 2 of Vape Craft Inc's most popular fruity and dessert flavors. Also, Ray has great customer service and always takes care of the customer's needs! He has a customer discount rewards program that is absolutely amazing. Check it out and take advantage of the amazing discounts here! 😃👍🏿<//review>

I have been coming to Valley Vape for the past couple of years and I absolutely love this place. What makes it so special is the owner, Ray and his wife and Floyd and the other staff. I immediately felt like I was part of the family. Always a great selection, great prices and great service! I don’t shop anywhere else! Keep up the good work!!< /text>

<text>Very professional and friendly! I've been here a couple of times now and I've always been treated with a warm welcome. The gentleman at the counter even remembered my last visit! He helped me select the flavor of my vape juice and was spot on, I love it. 10/10 would recommend.< /text>< gmap_id>

This is one of the best vape shops I've been to in socal. From the great pricing, huge selection, and amazing customer service, I'd be a regular customer if I lived locally. They were my hero today for sure!< /review>

Very professional and friendly! I've been here a couple of times now and I've always been treated with a warm welcome. The gentleman at the counter even remembered my last visit! He helped me select the flavor of my vape juice and was spot on, I love it. 10/10 would recommend.</Text>

<Review>My man Ray did an excellent job of helping me find a new mod and a legit tank. He patiently spent 45 minutes answering all my questions and made sure I left happy. Although they were out of some flavors I was interested in, Ray was able to help me find alternatives that were comparable. I confidently spent over $300 this first visit and I will definitely be coming back for all my future vape needs!<//Review><response>None< /response>< user>

Shop is clean and orderly. The selection is nothing like it used to be. Prices are not the worst, but not the best. Still seems like a great vape shop/lounge, couches foosball and a sweet dog.< /review>

Guy behind counter completely ignored my wife and I when we greeted him. We then stood at counter for a couple minutes in a totally empty store while the guy finished his text conversation. So when we finally got some attention, it was over priced. The beauty of capitalism is you can take your money to other shops.<//Review>

<text>Valley Vapes unfortunately leans on the shady side of sales. They have a habit of under-quoting prices then overcharging on the receipt. It's happened a number of times but $5-10 here and there wasn't worth burning a bridge with the closest local shop. (Prices are not marked in the store so you're cost is up to them)
A while back I picked up 2 new tanks, a pack of coils for each, a couple 30mils and a "Fuchai 213" by Sigelei. I'm not heavy into the vape community, I simply use the devices so I rely heavily on what I'd expect to be a professional within one's industry.
I was quoted $100 for the mod and confirmed it was a good choice. After swiping the card, it was naturally $10 over the quote, where the tanks were $3-4 over the quote... who knows how much of a premium was tagged onto the other products. I did receive $19 in "discounts" from my rewards number.
Once I got home, I looked the mod up on Youtube for a full rundown on the controls and immediately saw just about everywhere online selling for $48 with free shipping (some as high as 70 with 'free' Sony cells). A little frustrating but I'd rather support local business and understand online shops often sell near dealer cost. Youtube had a slew of negative demos where the temp control was faulty, the USB was charge only (no firmware updates), charging port balancing issues, over-claimed wattage, etc.
I felt a bit taken for a ride. I can't help but think not only are prices bumped at will, but they were also well aware the device had issues and wanted to move them. I called no more than an hour or so after purchasing to see if we could make things right. "No returns, no exchanges, all sales final." I have my suspicions the gentleman I spoke to on the phone was the same that rang me up but he claimed to had not been there when the mod was sold and that he'd have to talk to his manager and have "him" call me back.
I was the only person in the shop aside from a young lady laying down on the couch. I can appreciate there's often plenty of work to be done off of the sales floor so I gave it a few hours to see if I get a call back before posting. Call never came.

Long story short, if you plan on trying out Valley Vape:
1) Do not buy products on the whim (Don't rely on their "expertise").
2) Know what you're after and the average brick & mortar going rate.
3) Ask for prices before picking products AND before paying to ensure they match up. Record the audio if need be (seriously, it's that bad...)
4) Honestly, I'd suggest shopping elsewhere. This isn't an honest company and truly does not deserve your business.< /text>< pictures>

<resp>None</resp><review>QUALITY products. AUTHENTIC products... if ur short of cash, then they got a couple things for u (CAM mod and what not), but if ur looking for the big boy toys... this is THE SHOP. Best AV selection in east daygo thats for sure. Amazing amount of random accessories and small addons for ur setups, which i honestly feel is where 90% of shops are slacking on.  Huge juice selection (other then they only carry a few 0nics but most people vape 3-6). There is a couple issues i have tho, and its the way they talk to or treat people. Josh has a hard job tho trying to satisfy customers while keeping a business running, but i feel as tho he tries to get away with giving attitude or harsh words to those who frequent the shop. i come in with younger cats (18-23) and i feel as tho i get treated unintelligent, or as if my word is taken ALOT more lightly. I get VERY little chit chat with him, and if i do, i feel as tho hes always trying to correct me in some sort. Another thing is the amount of pinching and dimming josh does.... getting another penny out of everything he can.... but again, i guess how some people run their business. They definitely DONT overcharge, they just arent cutting any phat deals. Keep in mind tho that 75% of their product is top of the line stuff tho. Anthony is really cool, ask any frequent and they can tell u just about the same thing regarding both these people, havent met another frequent that doesnt feel the same yet. I WILL continue going, as its still a friendlier vibe then i get in most shops, but i feel they need to recognize and adjust.

Great shop. I quit smoking and went in for a vape. The owner (I believe his name is Josh?) actually helped me pick one out and was honest/upfront, he didn't just try to sell me something, he spend over 2 hours showing me everything, the pros and cons of each unit etc. Eventually I went with the Sigelei 75watt temp control. He hooked me up with a discount. It's been over 2 months and I haven't had a cig. Every time I come in for more juice or coils these guys are awesome, attentive, patient and carry premium juice flavors that are free of any harmful chemicals etc. The other thing I like about their juices is that most are made right here in California (go local!). I know i'm relatively new to vaping , but if you are a seasoned pro, or a newbie like me i'm sure you'll like this shop. Give them a try. You wont be disappointed.< /Review>

Great local neighborhood park t anyone is welcome to attend and enjoy what this park has to offer. Conveniently nestled on the edge of an accreditted and distinguished CA elementary school, and tucked behind a SAMLARC RSM Community pool.  Easily accessible and plenty of space to host birthday parties, BBQ's,picnics, etc. Tennis courts and a playground for children that is definitely worth the visit. Without a doubt the ride home will be peaceful because all of their energy was burned out in just a couple hours .... this applies to fur babies too!!🐾 🐕😉😊😁<//text>

Great park. A little sunny in the middle of the day but lots of trees all around the playground.< /Review>

Awesome park! The table area is large enough to host a large group.

Charcoal BBQs are clean and in good condition. Good parking options.

Landscaping is in great condition. Terracing of landscaping allows for different types of activities without feeling like one giant park. Ball parks and walking paths are also in great condition/proximity.< /review>

Nice public park with kid's play jungle, swings, tennis courts, swimming pool and jogging track. It also has a large gazebo with lots of benches for a picnic or party. Nice area to spend afternoon.< /Text>

Nice grass to play and walk on, good pavilion for a picnic, good little play ground, a couple tennis courts, a couple baseball diamonds, and a 1/4 sidewalk track to run around the park. Loved that I could run while watching the kids play. Got a5k in in no time!</Review>

Decent park for sports , tennis , baseball games , volleyball area ,birthday parties as there is one covered table area that is busy almost every weekend .  There is a small children’s play area in the back . The bathrooms are on the other side by the pool . The pool area itself is is for RSM residents only .  Over all nice shaded trees and grass area to walk the dog or relax at the park .<//review>

Watch out for tennis players.  They run that place like a jail gang.  You can hear them grunting and see them decimating those hapless little green balls all day and into the night.  Watch out for swinging rackets!< /Text>

I was able to purchase insurance quickly and easily, but I wish I could specify more what my business is. There are a lot of diverse startups in my area, all operating in different ways, being able to itemize and eliminate coverage qualities I need/don't need would be so helpful! Also, does Next Insurance offer 1 time event insurance and/or licensing services (like alcohol commission licenses)? That would be dope!</Text>

We currently don't short-term policies, but you do have the ability to cancel your policy online at any time. If you decide to cancel early, you'll receive a pro-rated refund for any unused premium on your account. At this time, we don't offer coverage intended for events with regards to alcohol, but it is something we're looking into! If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to us at support@nextinsurance.com. We're happy to help!"}< /Resp>< userid>

So far ,at this point ,it’s been less than a week since I have had next insurance ,but the initial process was definitely five stars! They say what they mean and they mean what they say ! it wasn’t a lot of running around and the app was easy to use.</Text>

Next insurance is the greatest!!!   It has so easy to get my agent on the phone before I signed up, it remains that way now that I am a customer.  The process was simple, and the price was afforable.  I have been searching  for the right agent and company for almost two years. I was referred to Vince, who was highly recommended, he is what they say... a good fair man who handles his business.  Thanks Next Insurance.  You made the search process simple and pain free.< /text>

I was able to purchase a commercial policy in literally 10 minutes .
I've had this same type of insurance (E&O) before and it has always taken at least 5 days to get, and I got it at a lower premium.  I'm a fan!< /Text>

Quick and easy. They didn’t bog me down with unnecessary questions  or hoops to jump through. Doesn’t include workers comp, make sure your employer knows that. 1 star deducted because they lead you to believe there is only ONE price options,  but there is a range of coverage and you can choose instead of going with the initial package offered.<//Review>

It was pretty simple to get insurance  but I did not like how they started me on a more expensive plan  2 million policy when I only neede the bare minimum.  And there was no way to change it. Kinda scandalous  dropped them for that reason and went somewhere 20.00 cheaper for 1 million policy , my God man only neede for some lite handyman work like cleaning gutters pressure washing ect
Did not need a 2 million dollar policy for that</review>

One company called at an inopportune time and I asked them to call me the next day. Two days passed,  and I resumed my hunt for a policy.
I found your company’s site and within a few minutes I purchased a General Liability policy for my new LLC. The site made it very easy to understand pricing and coverage needs. I plan on purchasing another policy very soon. By the way the other company finally called six days later. I told them “snooze and you loose”.</Text>< resp>

I needed a General Liability policy for my new business as well as Commercial Auto insurance for my vehicle. I shopped extensively online and through my local agent. The Next Insurance website was, by far, the easiest to navigate. The pricing options were easy to understand without a bunch of legal speak. I had a couple of questions later on and suddenly my phone rings from a well-spoken Next Insurance agent. The pricing and coverage options were very competitive so I went with Next Insurance. I had to contact them 2 more times after I signed up to get my Liability certificate fine tuned for the picky DOPL. Both times I was greeted by a live human agent (after requesting “live agent” from the robot dude). Incredibly professional, understanding, well-spoken and competent agents each time! This is incredibly rare in a time where companies are routing calls to India. I had my amended certificates emailed to me in minutes. Needles to say, I’m very pleased thus far and pleasantly surprised with the amazing customer service I have received.</Text>

As of this point I can say Next insurance has done a good job. They provided a quote online and a service rep contacted me a couple of days later to see if he could answer any questions which he did. I was able to print my  insurance certificate out immediately  after  purchasing the policy. I look forward to seeing how they perform if I should need them in case of a claim.<//Review>

Your name says it …  “NEXT”

I knew that after those clear, easy to follow instructions, your patience, attitude, prices, and perseverance, that you were going to be “next” in my list, and I was right, I have been in the construction field 41 + years and of course I dealt with many insurance and bonds companies and you are the best … “clear, concise and concrete” and that is what a contractor needs

Keep the good work, keep healthy and continue in keeping us happy!

Love this insurance. The application was very easy and the service fast.
No waiting for days to be insured and the price was the best deal for my business.
Next Insurance will be my business insurance for years to come.
Finally, a small business insurance you can afford.</text>

Fantastic company! Needed Insurance for huge events that my company has been booked this year and found Next Insurance. At first I was spectacular but they had everything ready and I sent all the papers to the event places. If you have a Bounce House company. I strongly  recommend this company! Thanks again.</review>

Surprisingly simple for my small business to use. Forms were easily sent to prospective clients. Love that I can do it myself instead of having to wait for an agent to call me back for more information before a client could receive the certificates.

I have two separate policies with next. Dispatch insurance and handyman. The original quote for the handyman coverage was $40 a month. When I called to actually purchase it I was told $61. Which is a far cry from $40. But other then that it's fine I guess. Can't work without coverage, but probably gonna keep checking around for something less expensive. The dispatch coverage is awesome tho. $25 a month I can afford. 👍< /Review>

The General Liability Insurance quote over the phone was very fast and the premiums are very competitive. I was even able to talk to a Real Person without being put on hold for endless minutes. YEAH!
I am very satisfied with the service so far and highly recommend Next.</Review>

You can't validate the address of my rural business with USPS, so you simply apologize and refuse the quote. If you don't cover Alaska, I can understand that. But it's bad to refuse customers because of your technical problem, instead of taking the chance to betterize process/ fix a bug (I receive mails every days at the same USPS address).<//text>

<Review>I am a subcontracted carpenter and have been established for 4 years. I wish I would have signed up with NEXT 4 years ago. I have not had a claim and hope to never have one.. that being said insurance is something that is 100% required in my profession. Next was easy, not only for signing up but continued monthly payments and personal management. It eliminates the agent from the equation allowing me to send certificates directly to contractors with out having to bug another human to do my work. It is cheaper than I've ever paid by about 30%. Hopefully if I ever do have to put in a claim they will be as easy and stream lined with dealing with that  as they are with taking my payments. So far very happy.</Review><date>1564251810504</date><GmapID>0x808fbae5e7a483f3:0x1d75c2b31f36563a<//GmapID><Response>None</Response>< username>

<review>I've been searching locally for general liability insurance for about 3 months now.
Sometimes it feels like nobody wants to write a policy.
And then I found NEXT insurance .
From start to finish it has been the most Pleasant an amazing experience being able to type in what you need online hit the Go Button and pay for the policy and boom your covered.
I hope I never need to file a claim, but if I do I hope doing so is as easy as getting the policy!
Im sure it will be.
Thanks NEXT Insurance !!

<Review>I went through a local insurance company for general liability for personal training. It took them 3 days to get a quote to me which ended up being $800/year! I immediately hopped online and found next insurance. Quote process took me <5min and it was $172/year with more coverage!! No brainer for me. Thanks Next Insurance!< /Review>< Pictures>

So far so good. Unbelievable prices that are very affordable than what I'm used to paying. Only took minutes to sign up. Got my documents right away and have already utilized the Certificate of Insurance to one of my customers which was very easy and quick to do. Hopefully this company will stand up to what they are representing so far and they will have my business from now on.< /review>

So far so good.
Signing up for insurance was easy and quick. Their website was intuitive and funneled through quickly.
Hopefully I will never need to use it.
If I do I will update this post to reflect that process.< /Text>

So far so good. Next Insurance is an affordable way to quickly and easily pick up a general liability insurance policy. I purchased my policy on my phone and immediately had a certificate to show a client. I have only had my policy for a few days but so far I am happy.</text>

The sign up experience was smooth and quick. I needed immediate coverage and was able to complete the process in about 20 minutes. Proof of insurance and additional insured on policy are available immediately and have simply links to share via email.< /text>

<Text>In SHORT.
AFFORDABILITY at last!  For years I carried a Farmers group gli...it seemed their rates increased year after, with no REASON as to why...I had NEVER FILED a claim against them & always paid my coverage on their due date.
Finally, we, the small business owners are getting a break” from doing business at an affordable level with thanks to the folks at Next Ins.< /Text>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Absolutely amazing. From one business to another, use these guys. The cheapest rates, and they were the fastest to sign up with. I had a proof of insurance certificate within minutes for my customers. The process couldn't have been easier.

I initially started my search with these guys first, so of course I had to keep searching. After about an hour of shopping I came running back to them.

Thank you guys for streamlining the process. You are definitely ahead of your time.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Give this company a 5-star rating their online presence was good I found them at a couple other places also. I enjoyed talking to Sarah and particularly as she was a fantastic person to talk to and knew everything about the policies and what I was looking for and helped me decide with which policy to go with.</Text>

I own a small business and I needed to renew my liability insurance. I found NEXT and within 10 mins I had coverage. Not only quick and very efficient but only cost me a fraction of what I had  been paying for years, for the exact same coverage. I only wish I had found them sooner. I highly recommend this company!!<//Text>

<Text>Great company to work with, the online application was easy to use and you get an instant quote. I've inquired with a lot of online insurance companies over the years and they bombard you with pushy phone calls, not  Next Insurance they deliver without the pushy sales people. This company was great to work with I highly recommend.< /Text>< pictures>

The process was very simple to get insured for personal training and nutrition. It took literally minutes and I had the required documentation to prove I was insured for a client I was seeing that same day. Highly recommended.< /Review>

I need ed a general liability insurance for a job I took on in Huntsville Alabama. I was never asked to get insurance on the other jobs I've had in the past. It it was so easy I can get insurance through next insurance I would recommend it to anybody looking for general liability protection. Thanks Roy</review>

The company that insured me was Gallagher Bassett, which is who they use for general liability as well.  i was involved in an auto accident where a commercial box truck hit me from behind on the freeway and totalled my  truck.  i went to the hospital and had a bunch of scans and check done to make sure i was ok.  It wasn't cheap.  i made the claim on 6-24-19 and almost 60 days later, my medical bills have not been paid, i have yet to be made an offer for my vehicle or all of my  tools that i lost in the accident.  I have been in a rental the entire time and that bill is also adding up.  i understand i didn't have rental coverage, however it also doesnt take 60 days to handle something like this.  California insurance code gives 30 calendar days once the claim was accepted.  So now i have a rental truck for an additional 30 days that the party at fault is not going to want to pay because this has been taking so long.  Ive called Next insurance every other day to make them get a hold of Gallagher basset, since I am paying them i feel that they should have them get a hold of me or my attorney.  So if you do buy insurance from this company, i hope that you never have any issues because i'm sure your experience will be no different than mine.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1566607085962, 'text': 'Hi Robert,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

I was able to purchase insurance for my CPT business in less than 15 minutes. Everything was explained in great detail, and the entire experience was painless.  Next Insurance clearly gets it, when it comes to customer service!< /Text>

I saved just over $200 of my annual premium hrough Next Insurance. I'm a small business owner for over 30 years. I was nervous doing this entirely on line, however this is easier than ever and I did my own certs and emailed them to my customers. I'm still surprised. But it works.< /review>

Next insurance  was so easy. As a new buisness  owner I thought the process of getting  insured would be awful. Not the case here!!! They ask a few simple questions and they had me set... thanks NEXT.< /Review>

I was amazed at how easy it was to select the right insurance for my company. Although my company offers more than one service. I was only  allowed to select one category.</Review>
