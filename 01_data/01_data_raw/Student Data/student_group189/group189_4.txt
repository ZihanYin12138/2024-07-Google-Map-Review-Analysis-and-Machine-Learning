<text>Very concerned with the integrity of the management team at this apartment complex.  While moving my daughter in last month, my room mates father and I both noticed a fibrous material lodged in the HVAC vents.  We thought it might be asbestos, since we are both engineers with over 25 years experience, we though it prudent to bring this to the managements attention.  A month later, the manager told our daughters the test came back negative, but would not share the results of the report.  What is this, the dark ages?  This is the first time I have ever written a negative posting, but the lack of progressive thought by the management team leads me to believe they are out of touch with modern thought process and information sharing.  I plan on sending out a sample myself for peace of mind.< /text></record>

My friends and I were looking for a place to rent and we found this place. A women named Jessica was extremely helpful and answered all of our questions in a fast and easy manner! Some situations happened and we unfortunately had to cancel our applications, Jessica was externally helpful and understanding. If we are ever looking for another place to rent we will definitely have this place high on our list just because of how corporative and understanding the staff was! Thank you!</review>

I’ve had a great experience every time with the office and employees. I have also received fast service from them each time I needed something fixed in my apartment. The downside to this place is the parking! It’s parking by permit only yet there is no one on duty to enforce this. I think they need to extend parking to accommodate their renters and guests or actually enforce permit parking because it is a problem. Other than that, great place.< /Review>

I do think it's a quite place to live but the only thing I don't agree with is the pictures of what the inside of the apartments look like. The lay out is correct but the counter tops, sinks, stove,tub, flooring,walls, Windows DO NOT match the photos in any way. They're not horrible but in no way do they look like what are in the photos. However the pool, exercise pics are the same.< /text>

Staff - front desk and maintenance crew -  is very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The complex is going through a complete renovation and updates and it is coming together very nicely!
Some nights are noisy with parties and people coming and going late into the night.
Overall I feel safe here though, both in the complex and the neighborhood. It is close to a lot of amenities.</review>

We moved in last month and the office staff has been nothing but professional.  When we signed our lease they were very thorough with the information we need to know.  I have read the reviews on here about the management and cars being towed and do not know about all of that so maybe management/owners have changed.  For us, it's been no problem and the office staff have been very helpful. We are happy to be here.<//Review>

They have no respect for their residents. They are rude and have no professionalism. They ladies sitting on the front desk have no sense and I bet! they are not even educated enough to sort out common problems of the residents.
The parking is a huge problem in this property and that is not due to the space but the management. They got my car towed even though I am a resident from my parking spot and made me pay for their deeds.
They evade all your problems, whenever you need their help they just escape it.

The management is good for nothing!!!!!!!!
Please don’t waste your money and peace of mind on these apartments!!!<//review>< pics>

<text>!!THIS IS NOT A FAKE REVIEW!!.. what I am about to say is 100% true based off my experience living here! (Only saying this cause I know when I read reviews I always wonder if the really good ones are fake lol) I LOVE living here. Moving next to a university you’d think it would be loud noisy and messy around here.. but NOPE. It’s very clean, maintenance answers work orders as soon as they can, the managers and staff are all really helpful and I’ve never had an issue with roaches, atleast in MY unit. The ONLY downfall I would say to this building is I wish there were more free parking spaces for how many cars they actually have on site. Other than that (maybe I’ve been lucky) but I’ve had a great experience moving here and the day I move out I’ll be very sad.< /text><user>102118666690141704633</user></record></dataset><record>

This has been by far the worse place I've lived in.   I can't wait until my lease is up.  I had a late night issue with my bathroom shower handle not shutting off properly & I wasn't able to reach anyone.  Called emergency numbers, left voice mails,  sent online maintenance order requests, and nothing.  I've had many false  promises given to me.  Please beware if your looking into staying here,  definitely can't call it home.</Text>

Parking is horrible ! There's always people in your stalls. I'm not one to call for someone's car to be towed but it's getting ridiculous and they haven't given guest passes in over three months so if you have a guest they have to park a ways down from the apartments. I preferred the old ugly lot at least there were more parking space.</review>

The last year of living here was the worst. There was no parking so I had to park down the block and walk a block or two at night. Even though I paid for a parking pass.  So if you have any roommates someone always has to be home. Also forget about having company over you will be towed. So plan on a very solitary life there. There is no security so if you are looking for a place for your daughter to live while going to Fresno state this is not the place. The gropper was caught on property twice and still no security. Someone broke into our apartment and we asked if the lock could be changed and they wanted to charge us $25. Wow that is some good customer service there.
With the construction there is mice and roaches like you would not believe. There is no washer dryer hook ups, and the laundry rooms always have one or two machines that aren’t working. So if you work or go to school in the day time you have to walk around there at night. And at that time the smell of marijuana is very overwhelming.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Came to visit my girlfriend from out of town which I arrived at 12am, there isn't any guest parking on cite. Which I ended parking on a reserved parking spot which was the only spot to find with no designated number in sight. Woke up early at 8ish to notice that my car was getting towed by West coast towing, had to pay 255 to take it out, easy money for them but hard earned money for me. This place needs guest parking, my visit was more expensive that expected by having my car towed, not cool.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I lived here for more than seven years.  They were to have given me the entire deposit back (California statute) due to the amount of time I lived there.  They did not.  I considered taking them to small claims court but ended up not following through (which was my fault but I just wanted to be done with it).

Then I got a phone call - Hey, you owe us money from the move out. I gave the person an ear-full, let them know that I didn't receive my deposit that I was entitled to (by law, mind you), and that I was owed money not the other way around.

This would have been the end of it....until I got ANOTHER phone call YEARS later (four years later, to be exact) asking me about the money I "owed". *sigh*.  I had to explain to that lady what the deal was (apparently she was newly hired, had gone through the files to be a diligent worker, and unilaterally decided to follow-up on my file in order to be a good worker bee; bless her heart).  She was caught like a deer in a headlights at my response, although I was not rude nor was I even mad at that point just amazed at the lack of organization by management.

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!  Take pictures when you move in, and take pictures when you move out!  Video tape the walk through at move in and at move out.  Make sure they provide an itemized list that details what the costs were in case they do not give your whole deposit back!

Back when I lived here, car break-ins were extremely frequent (it was only a matter of time before you car got broken into, almost like a rite of passage in becoming a resident here).  Management didn't care.  And there was a maintenance man that appeared to be a nice guy (though a bit rough around the edges) that ended up getting arrested because he was using the master key to enter apartments and steal stuff.

Our place was burglarized because it was right next to Barstow (due to the amount of foot traffic, I presume).  My neighbors next door were burglarized several times; there were a couple of guys that lived there that were victimized, and later on a girl who lived there that had to live through a very scary home invasion type burglary/robbery.

Just another day at the Plazas.

Were there good times?  Of course.  This was, however, in SPITE of management (not because of them).  The biggest plus about this complex is that it is close to Fresno State campus.  Beyond that?  PLEASE BE CAREFUL!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Not only was there construction during my experience living here without rent being deducted for the inconvenience (early morning wakeups, taking over all back parking with tools), but they also shut my water off on multiple occasions without notifying me. They also don't have enough parking for residents let alone guests there were multiple times when there was not a single spot for me to park and I had to drive to my mom's. My car window was vandalized within a month of me living here and no one did anything about it there are no cameras nor a gate and I hardly ever saw security. When it comes to moving out be careful if you and your roommate end on bad terms (like me and mine did)who ever files their 30 day notice first will receive the security deposit check as they cannot split it for whatever reason. The staff is friendly that's about all they have going for them I would not recommend living here to anyone.</Text>< pictures>

<Name>Ankit Pathak<//Name><Text>We lived here in a 2bhk plan for almost more than 2 years and just moved out of here a month ago. And, I think the place came under new management almost an year ago.

Regarding staff, I would say that the current leasing staff is really helpful and they do listen to all your problems and try to work on them as soon as they can. And although, we did got some roach problems (which I guess can happen at any place) a few months back before moving out, but they did helped us in fumigating the apartment for us and were really helpful.

The only concern which I had and I think was the same for most of the other people was that you need a guest parking pass to even park in the open parking space, which you need to collect from office (once a month) if a guest is coming to your place. Now, If your guest doesn't have the pass and the car is parked in an open space, it will definitely be towed. Even though, I do think it's kind of a hassle for people who are new here but then again, I think its kind of necessary as otherwise being so close to Bulldog stadium and Fresno state, people will start parking in the open spaces and so the actual tenants and their guests will not have spaces for their cars to park, so I do kind of understand that.

Also, since we lived here for more than 2 years and so I will have to admit that the apartment was not actually in its best shape when we moved out, but we still got a very good amount (almost 80%) of our security deposit back.
So thanks again Monica (the Manager) and Francisco (the maintenance guy) and the other 2 ladies (sorry, I don't remember your exact name) at the office. Keep up the good work :)</Text>< Rating>

<text>This is the worst place i've ever lived at!! The outside is getting remodeled yet the inside still looks ugly and infested with roaches! i pay almost $900 for 2 bedrooms and 1 bath, that's too much for how ------ this place is. let's not forget how much management sucks. I called about a leak and they didn't show up to fix it 2 weeks later. on top of that the outside is getting remodeled and they're removing all parking spots so people have to park down the street with a chance of your car getting towed and even though numerous people have complained management doesn't care!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>My family and I have lived here for 3 years now. My spouse, my 6 year old and I absolutely love it! I see a lot of negative reviews on here and I can just tell you it's a bunch of balony. All 3 years I have lived here, I have NEVER seen any insects at all. If you have insects it's because your apartment is SUPER dirty. I mean if you live like your homeless then you can't expect to be insect free and no matter how much they spray the issue will never go away. Also, the negative comments on here about the no parking, loud construction workers etcccc.....that by far is the dumbest thing to write a review about. Their intentions are to better the community with beautiful scenery and also upgrade the security. They don't have the intentions to make anyone upset or cause any inconveniences for anyone. They give monthly bulletins to all tenants informing them of upcoming changes, progress made and most definitely aplogizing for any inconvenience it may cause tenants and visitors. So it's pathetic to write a negative review for something that is understandable. This community has really bloomed in a beautiful place I call home. I absolutely love the staff in the office including maintenence. The community manager Monica is such a great person. She's so professional and always finds a way to better your stay here no matter what you need. I don't understand how she has any negative reviews on here, she is the most understanding person I have met. You can't make everyone happy. People will find anything to complain about. Jessica & Pah in the office are great also. Very professional and helps in any way possible. Tom is by far the best maintenence worker. I don't have favorites but he is really amazing. He goes above and beyond to fix anything even if it's not on the work order. He came to fix my toilet one time when I made a work order and after he finished he replaced my air filter and changed light bulbs even though it wasn't on the work order. He is so fast with fixing anything and he's really social.....he will literally conversate with you while he is working. These by far are the best apartments I have lived in. They are always kept up and clean and the grounds keeper does an amazing job. They spray I believe every week for bugs and the grass gets cut every week. A- lot of the renovations are complete and it is beautiful! I feel so safe living here with my family. I would definitely recommend living here. If your looking for a safe community for your family with understanding, caring and professional staff, then Plaza Apartments Community is where you wanna be. 👏< /Review>< Pictures>

Worst parking situation! We have talked to management but we still get people parking in our stall. We call the STC private security but they said they don't tow they only cite which doesn't solve our problem of not having a parking a space. When I ask for a solution they said I would complain to your management about the procedure we have to take. Yet we as residents have been towed twice while living here. Horrible!!!</text>

Horrible place, I visited my brother here for a few days, my brother has been complaining about tenants that live above and beside them. This complex states, that under no circumstances that dogs are allowed in this place, but they Allowed some tenants have a huge dogs living in the complex, the dog constantly running jumping growling all hours of the night. My brother told one of the women on the front desk, she said that the tenants upstairs has a permit. And when I asked the tenants upstairs they said they have someone they know that works in the office and the lady allowed them to have a dog in the apartment. And for what I see the tenants upstairs does not have any type of disabilities to have any special type of permit. I don't have anything against dogs, but if the dog keeps your family at night and management has done nothing about this issue because they know the tenants that live their is absolutely wrong. And the others tenants that live beside them constantly have parties every weekdays and weekends till 7am in the morning with their loud annoying music,  and people coming and going doing drugs in the front doors is infuriating my brother. And my brother told the same Lady about this issue still nothing was done at all. And fact that management constantly harassing them on what they should up in their balcony is horrible, its not like their balcony is messy, its just that they put non balcony items their because they don't have space inside. Tenants should be allowed whatever they want to put in the apartment even balconies because they are paying for their apartment. And special treatments with other tenants is unfair and unjust just because they know someone that works at the office is wrong. They should pay attention more on the drug users and the actually finishing the apartment complex. Very disappointed in this place diffinitely going to all everyone we know about how horrible this place is and how they should never rent here. They should change all the people that work here they are horrible.< /Text>

There are a lot of roaches and other bugs in my new apartment, poor management as they disturbing in different ways,  like they wake you up at 6 am to move your car cuz they wanna repair parking and if you don't your car is towed! or some guy put a ladder behind my window at 7 am and got the nail gun and started workin on the woods! They are horrible! I would prefer to pay a couple of hundred more and work harder but live somewhere  relaxed, everything is so old! Most of the equipment is super old, old carpet!the air conditioning does not cool the weather! And as soon as you turn it on all of the walls will vibrate! Electricity plugs have short circuit and sparking so bad some times, some of them don't work, as a rule of stupid management if your guest is staying more than 3days you should let them know and pay more, your guest parking pass is not valid during footbal days cuz they wanna sell the parkings! I have never seen a security guard at night, 1month ago the gas lane was on fire and electricity cut off! Poor security,  not allowed to do something on your car more than adding water and they will charge you doing something on your car! The manager talks to you like youre her soldier and impolite! She is super rude and impolite! It is still not the best choice around campus if you don't have that much money, there are a couple of more apartments for the same price and better quality on shaw!<//review>

Me and my family haved lived here for almost 2 years. We have only every had roaches 3 times! 3 roaches each at different times and only because we left our back door open and they wandered in, The office was more than happy to send someone to spray the inside and outside of our place. There is NOOO infestation! Atleast not in our buliding. We have had small feild mice find their way in but they are harmless. There is one mantanece guy that works here who is a creep, He looks in peoples windows and stuff but most of the other staff is really friendly. We keep to ourselves and the neighbors are very quiet. The only down side, they have a no pet policy =[ Other than that we have had a very good 2 years here. We are sad to be leaving but we really want a puppy!< /text>

All their positive reviews are from their employees, not customers. They all love working there, of course, because they don't have to actually work. If they did someone would be answering their phones and delivering my package on time.< /review>< Pictures>

They sent a postcard to ask me to arrange my delivery.  They've had the item for almost a month, and this is the first contact they've made!  If that wasn't bad enough...

- the given phone number doesn't work
- their 1 800 number doesn't work either
- their "submit a claim" form doesn't load

There is no way to reach these guys, and I don't even know who they are or why they have my item.  What is this?</Text>

This is the worst shipping company I have ever dealt with. They have botched an order from Costco several times over the course of 4 weeks. Difficult to get ahold of them. Difficult to schedule a delivery. They keep losing contact with their drivers and their drivers keep forgetting to put our box on their truck. They keep losing information. They don’t attempt to correct their mistakes or even apologize or attempt to make things right. We still have not received our complete order from Costco! I hope they lose their Costco contract. Worst logistics company I have ever seen! Costco drop these people, please!!!!!!!</Text>

<Text>Horrible horrible horrible! They emailed asking for scheduled delivery window a week before the delivery. I selected an available 4 hour delivery window. Took a day off waiting for the shipment and no signs of delivery. I called their 800 number several times without a response. Then I called the phone number of the local distribution center and got through talking to someone after 10 unsuccessful times. I gave her the tracking number and asked about where the delivery is since it was 3 hours past the delivery window. To my surprise, she said that the shipment is thousands of miles away and nowhere close to delivery. I am extremely frustrated with the fact that I had to take unpaid time off from work to receive the shipment since they said I need to stay at home to sign the delivery. COSTCO, I am very unhappy... I am surprised this business exists...<//Text><gmapID>0x808f95b7150923eb:0xda6710c87520abdf</gmapID><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

I ordered a christmas tree from Costco online and to be delivered by CEVA. They called me a week earlier and scheduled a delivery window of 8am-12noon, and I have to be present for the signature. On the delivery day they did not show up by 12noon and no phone calls to give me a heads up. I called around 12:30pm and the operator said she would check and get back to me, which she never did. The truck finally showed up around 4:30pm, but they did not even contact me prior to arrival (they missed the delivery window and what if I were not home?). Looked at other reviews, they are indeed the worst logistics company.</review>

If i could give 0 star, i would do that.
The driver can't even wait for me for 10 minutes so i can get home for my deliver. Worse, if he won't wait, shouldn't have told me to come home ... took me 7 minutes to get home and he was already gone. I called them to see if they would be back later so i would wait at home but they didn't bother to pick up the phone.
I had no choice but to call the 800 number to reschedule and they gave me the schedule for next day. I took a day off from work to wait for them this time but they did not come ... i called the local number and they told me they could not make it today.. didn't even bother to give a reason or to call me and tell me they could not make it; Unbelievable.</text>

Waited home all day for a scheduled delivery (10 am-2 pm) when I called at 2 pm because delivery hadn't arrived...was told that items were still in Chicago and their "local" office should have contacted me.  Was transferred to "supervisor" Jocelyn who told me someone had tried to call me a few days ago...of which I have no record and they were unable to leave me a message?!  She thought it was no big deal that I waited all day for a delivery and disconnected our call when I was upset and trying to figure out why someone hadn't followed up if they couldn't leave a message or email me.  Worst service ever.</text>

Horrible deliverer. HSN uses this company. Delivered a Samsung 65” tv damaged. Called HSN and they sent Ceva back out to pickup damaged tv. Guess what? Ceva picked up and never returned the tv back to HSN! I can’t get no where with Ceva because I misplaced my tracking number and their customer service can’t find my order even after giving them my full name and address! Crooks!!< /text>

Brought a TV from Costco and they subcontracted it out to this company.  First scheduled delivery, they changed it without letting me know.  Second delivery, they said the driver is having some sort of problem and all the other drivers are out.  Again, no notification at all.  Very poor communication and service.  Avoid at all cost and do not use them.< /review>

Item was to have arrived yesterday, but a delivery was attempted at 1:22 PM in a different city.  I called in and Anna at CEVA said they attempted to deliver it to us but our business wasn't open (!).  At 1:22 PM, folks.  So I assured her that I was at the front desk and all our doors were open.  She then said delivery was foiled because of the weather.  Yes, it was sprinkling rain that day; that must have done it; all good delivery people give up at 1:22 PM.  So now delivery is delayed TWO DAYS.  Pretty much every answer she gave me was contradicted by facts, so I asked to speak to her supervisor.  She connected me to a recording which said they are too busy to answer and to call back another time - then I was disconnected.  I don't know what kind of cut rates these folks have, but folks, please don't do this to your customers.  Pay the extra $20 or whatever and have someone reputable handle your goods.<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><review>Waiting on a big item to be delivered from 3-6pm. Got off work early and got to my house right at 2:45. There's a note on the door saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. Called the company(had to go online to find the number since the number on the note/receipt was bogus)  and rescheduled for the next day between 10am-2pm, so I took off work. I called to check on it at 11am, said within the hour. It's now 3pm and I can't get ahold of anyone at the company, nor has my $500+ item showed up.

Wrong numbers on invoice/note
Can't get ahold of the company
No answering service all you get is "the wireless number is currently unavailable"

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU DO BUSINESS. THEY'LL EMBARRASS YOU WITH THEIR INEPTITUDE AND MESS UP ANY SCHEDULE YOU MAY HAVE PROMISED A CUSTOMER. THEY ARE UNRELIABLE AND DO NOT COMMUNICATE PROPERLY. HORRIBLE BUSINESS< /review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Scheduled a deliver for Dec 7th it has been 5 days and no contact from their part.  It shows that they have received the TV on the 3rd and that they scheduled a deliver.  They lied to my parents about them calling and scheduling.

<Review>If there is an option of zero star, I won't give them even one. Horrible service, I don't know why Costco chooses them to make delivery. Two mornings wasted at home for nothing, still haven't received my package after 2 weeks.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Went right at opening on Wednesday morning 10:30. Had  Dirty Tea quite good for my 1st one ever. The employee was nice a bit on the quiet side. The parking was easy enough, and the cost verses size was adequate I would say. Enjoy!< /Text>

<review>Tea be honest, this was terrible. The tea. The service was quick but when asked a simple question I wasn’t offered much help. I got the guava smoothie. All I can taste is how a cheap bathroom air freshener smells... I know it’s harsh but for 2 drinks that taste like this was nearly $14. The cups are unique.

Pros: Service is quick, cups are cool

Cons: Taste like air freshener, pretty expensive, more than Frappuccino from Starbucks, customer service isn’t there.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_9wmPSpZzJXaT0IgnYRqRyxQCVBc94VaPIN8q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< username>

<Review>I wouldn't have minded the 15 minute wait for 2 teas and the fact that the order was wrong if it wasn't WAY too sweet. It could've used like 1/3 of the sugar. Couldn't drink it. Although the cashier was nice, I think she couldn't hear me order and got my order wrong because the blender was going and was too close to the front of the store.</Review>< rating>

<Text>When I went to go try this I already had low expectations because all my asian fam live in la/oc and the boba places out there are highly competitive. I got the thai tea slush and my sister got the brown sugar boba, the drinks were oddly bland but overly sweet. I will say the cups are cute and service was good/quick. I will probably try their fruity drinks next if I ever go back but overall its meh.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I had to give it 2 stars because of the dress code. Yes! Strapless shirt on of the girls every time I order. Is just doesn’t look formal for such a place the offer delicious drinks. Formal shirts & dress code, place will be a 10 star!< /Text><user_name>ROBLOX Playzzz</user_name><Time>1608248885314</Time>< userid>

SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! Staff is incompetent. Drinks are mediocre at best and definitely not worth the 45 minute wait. They do not comply with 6ft distancing and need to be reported to OSHA for cleanliness and improper sanitation. If you want to pay $10 for a cup of ice this is the place for you. Hopefully they lose business and shut down soon like all the businesses to inhabit that space before them. I’ll surely be making a call to the health department!<//text>

< review>
Today was my first time trying this place and I'm glad I did.  I ordered the tropical tea with fresh fruit and added the honey boba to it.  The tea was really good and clean tasting, and the honey boba was soft and fresh. The ONLY reason why I didn't give them 5 stars was because the amount of fresh fruit in my drink DID NOT match the advertised picture.  Mine had scarce bits and pieces floating around in it disguised with leaves and lemon.  Also, I'm not sure how slivers of strawberries and lemon are considered TROPICAL........... sound likes strawberry lemonade to me.  However, the tea was still tasty, so I will give them another try.<//review>

Favorite boba cafe in town I’ve only recently discovered. Love being able to adjust the sweetness levels and substitute milk for other non-dairy options. Boba is perfect and the Hot Cheetos Elote was very good. Local favorite!< /Text>

< Review>
The drinks were delicious, so 4 stars for that. But the people working there were a bit cold and lowkey rude, I won’t go back for that reason. I work in customer service and I know how tiring it can be, but if you’re going to put little to no energy in your exchange, find a new job. 😒</Review>

We got the chai milk tea and vanilla milk tea, they were delicious. Hopefully next time they get coconut milk tea back because that'll be worth the try.<//Text>

The drinks are interesting. If you're not familiar you have to ask what exactly they are and the group of students running the place aren't very helpful.</text>

(But had to come back and give it a 1*)
I come in atleast 3 times a week always very polite and nice But lack Getting my order right everytime they usually forget to add extra boba but this time they messed up 3 out of 4 of my drinks that I bought. I asked for 4 large bobas 2 with extra boba and one light boba also one being just regular boba. I restated my order so that there would be no mess up and received 2 without boba and 2 with light boba. Like how do u even get that? I live 20 min away so wasn't worth the drive but PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE CUSTOMERS SAY. REPEAT THE ORDER BACK TO THE CUSTOMER SO THIS DOESNT HAPPEN ANYMORE!!!! It's not that hard...</text>< pics>

<text>I went to the t-mobil store at 499 University Avenue in Palo Alto and was helped by Samantha. This was the 4th store we'd gone to. OMG the difference in help and customer service she gave us. She was a great listener! Thoroughly explained our options and was the best customer service-sales person I've had the pleasure of having in the last 30 years. I highly recommend visiting this store and Samanta actually we went back the next day and the manager Ashton was a breath of fresh air. Its people like Samantha and Ashton that make going to t-mobil great. Thank you very much you guys(and girl 😁) for being you and making our experience great.< /text><userid>101632125522967946966<//userid>< Response>

<text>Love it, as soon as you walk in everyone will tell you the same thing, you can do it online, they don't care if you really need help from them, an elderly friend of mine really needed help, she doesn't know much about technology but what better place to get help than Sprint, your company right??? Wrong,  they could care less and they will show you that they don't care, is not like they are pretending to. I saw a guy walk in and an  employee with out looking away from his computer just say, "what's going on", they are not even trying anymore, they make you feel like you are bothering them</text><gmapID>0x808fbb88e62fbe1b:0xa007a04860807a3a<//gmapID><Name>Miguel Torres</Name>< Pictures>

< review>
Today, I visited the Sprint store in downtown Palo Alto near Stanford Hospital. Are old j-3 phones are not holding charges and those batteries are difficult to find. Plus, I purchased 2 iPads 15 days ago. There try it out time is 14 days I just missed it. However their customer service was wonderful they gave me a discount that took away sticker shock from my bill. The young gentleman that worked with me for almost an hour in the store was so professional and patient. I really appreciate Sprint for providing such a great customer service Representatives. As a result, I will probably stay with Sprint for another two years or so. if you have any problems with your phone bill or the equipment that you get from Sprint they will back it up. I recommend them highly!< /review>

My wife and I went to this location to end our contract & the employee said "No, you guys have been here for years we'd hate to see you go. How about we throw in a FREE phone upgrade and a tablet." Naturally we jumped on this as we thought we were being rewarded for our customer loyalty. Days later we find out that he charged us for the phone, charged us for a whole new plan - that we didn't ask for, and refused to acknowledge this ingenious behavior stating that "It wasn't in writing." This store is down right deceitful & deplorable! We were shocked that something like this could happen from such a reputable company. We have yet to have this incident rectified from Sprint.< /text>

I cannot remember his name but when I walked in he was on a cell phone obviously engaged in a personal conversation which was extremely loud. I waited about 10 mins until he finally stopped what he was doing to see what I needed. He then starts the conversation with "if you are not the primary account holder I can't help you and I'm still helping the lady before you". I left and was not helped with what I needed. I've been a customer with sprint for years but I'm afraid that after this experience I will not be any longer.

<review>This place is the worst. Just tried for the second time to make a return within the 14 day period. Each time different excuse and no manager on duty to respond. Staff (both Donny and Enrique/Henrico) are the worst. Refused to call corporate, their manager, or do anything helpful to respond to the situation. The staff are actually the most unhelpful, rude people I've ever dealt with. I'm awaiting a call back from corporate and will speak to the regional manager about this.<//review>< Pics>

I was a sprint customer for a long time until I couldn't take the poor treatment and the horrendous customer service anymore. Their customer service is not only just plain awful; it's also offensive! I mean, they went out of their way to attack me and, basically, call me a liar because I had a complaint. I was so appalled. Sprint as a company is a terrible mess. I walked out of the store and went straight to Verizon down the street. I will never return to Sprint. Among the worst company I have ever had to interact with. Top two, for sure.</text>

This review is for Sprint generally in the Bay Area; Sprint worked fine for us in another city. We moved to the area and found the service was terrible here (dropped calls, missed calls, very poor voice quality, and frequent "no signal" readings). When we asked the Sprint customer service about cancelation they directed us to go to a Sprint store in-person to get our phones checked out. Long story short, after hours wasted with customer service we canceled with a full cancelation fee. If you go with Sprint in this area, check beforehand to see how coverage will be for you. Be ready to either deal with poor coverage or pay a full cancelation fee to switch out to something better. We are now on Project Fi and it the connection is consistently very good.< /Text>

I'm pretty positive they stole my leased phones when I turned them in and now Sprint has charged me $1,200 because they didn't "receive them."

Came in to have my phone fixed, had to wait for the "Tech" who turned out to be another salesman, he played with the kick-stand on the back of my phone (which had nothing to do with the issue) then brought it to the real tech in the back. When he returned he opened by asking me if I'm attached to my number, and pointing out that I'm out of contract and while saying my current plan is fine he implied I should buy a better one. Nether of those things have anything to do with the issue since I pay monthly for sprint total protection (which has been really great in the past, at a different store). I pretty much stopped him there since it was just a sales pitch and all I wanted was my phone repaired. He was still going at it to my back as I was walking out the door; from 15 ft away, at the back of the store. Wasted 20 min of my life. There are other service centers.

TL;DR
Went here to get my phone fixed, instead they wanted to sell me a new plan, contract, and phone. Rude customer service.</Text>

The staff and doctors are very informative and helpful in explaining every detail, from the eye exams to options for contact lenses and glasses. They're also efficient and get you in and out with very short wait times, even though I arrived about 15 minutes before my appointment.<//review>

Our family has been patients at Generations for quite a while now and they are hands down the best eye doctor we have had. Their entire staff is amazing from start to finish. Our two older boys have grown up going to this office and have never had a bad or scary experience. The staff is so warm and inviting, especially Dr. Ibanez. She is the primary doctor we see for our visits and she is the absolute kindest. Our boys love getting to see a picture of their eyes and reading through the big glasses, earning bonus points for the super small letters! Having kids, we appreciate their kindness & patience so much - would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an eye doctor in the area.</review>

<text>Dr. Ibanez just did an eye exam on my 5 year old and 2 year old. She was great with the kids!  My 5 year old was super excited to “play games” and the Dr was able to successfully complete a full exam!  My 2 year old was a little less cooperative, we the Dr was still able to see what she needed to make an assessment. Great first experience for my kids!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Eye doctors. They are like my glasses in the middle of the night. Can't seem to find them when I need them. Generations was referred to me by a family member and I haven't had anything but a great experience. I have gone to Costco, Lens Crafters and other big chains. I even did the completely online glasses vendor that takes your prescription and sends you a cheap pair of prescription glasses. The biggest reason I recommend Generations is because their customer service is fantastic. The biggest selling point used to be they had a shorter appointment schedule but their number of customers is growing, which is what you want for a business that will see you once a year at most. They are a hidden gem in Turlock so if you can find them, you'll SEE why EYE recommend them.</Text>

Clean office, upfront about what your insurance will cover. Great with myself, husband and my 6 year old daughter! Very professional and personable. Will definitely be keeping this office as our home optometrist.< /text>

I went in for my first visit today and couldn't be happier with this place! The staff is friendly and the doctor is fantastic! She is very patient and friendly. The selection of frames could have been a little better but I found glasses and sunglass that I like. I will definitely be back and will refer people here.< /review>

I have been going to Dr Bonander for 25 years now. She has always been great to work with my severe myopia and  stigmatism. I am difficult to fit with contacts and glasses so it is nice to go to someone that is patient and kind.<//Text>

<Text>Terrible costumer service. Severe lack of knowledge about how to use your insurance properly. Zero since of urgency and ownership.

I thought well is just one of those days, not  for her I called at a later time to provide a different insurance and she pretty much hung up on me very rude. It is really sad to call a provider and have such a RUDE RECEPTIONIST. I give her 1 star only because she answered the phone. Lord bless her day< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Worst experience in any medical office setting.  They forgot to order my contacts, and offered no explanation for the error.  A very poor solution offered.  Sadly,  it was not something I could use for my visual needs.<//review>

My very first appointment with Generations Family Optical which was recommended by my co-worker was on Friday August 13,2021. I had a great first experience it had been awhile since my eyes had been checked and I ended up needing glasses the Dr. was very informative during my exam and the staff was very helpful when it came to picking out my new glasses I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing their eyes checked or glasses very nice place.<//Review>

They were awesome! Super easy to work with. Didn’t have any headaches to deal with. Mateo the Sales Representative was amazing! Very communicative, timely, etc...he was very open and straight forward with the process and pricing. I didn’t ever have to wonder what was going to happen or if there were any surprises coming my way. Overall, the team was great and I would definitely recommend them if you need anything AC related. Well done! Thank you!</text>

We had an excellent experience! Madison was thorough and was dedicated to getting our Air conditioner fixed. He gave us multiple options and didn't pressure us, just provided the best information and prices for our repairs. We are happy that we found a local company with such amazing reviews that are so true! We can't wait to start having everything maintained regularly. Thank you for all your hard work and getting it up & running before the heat!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Jorge is simply the best. He is very professional, personable and knowledgeable. I like when people are honest about the things, he didn't come off as a salesman. He stated what was required, how much the service will cost and recommendations for the future. You don't find HONEST people like Jorge Cervantes these days. A TRUE CLASS ACT!!! I will certainly recommend Cool Air Solutions to anyone requiring service on their heating and cooling needs.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>We just completed a very large air conditioning project with Cool Air Solutions and while they were not the cheapest bid I received,  the service and performance we received was worth every penny!!  It started with Jay who came out and put together the initial bid.   He arrived on time and spent a good amount of time walking the property and discussing with us our options.  He let me ask him millions of questions and was more than happy to explain and answer all my concerns.  He worked with us to complete the financing of our three new units and work began almost immediately.  They were also willing to work scheduling around our needs as our property is a short term rental and the guest house on our property had guests at the time and they happily agreed to do that unit the following week once our guests checked out.

Freddie was the lead installer on our project and he was friendly and awesome to work with.  His crew was nothing short of the same.  They worked steady and cleaned up after themselves each day as if they were never there.  At the end of the job upon the final walk through with Freddie  there was a small punch list of things that had to be still be completed as he needed to order a few small parts as well as Freddie discovered the unit in our guest house needed a bigger breaker for the unit that was missed in the initial scope of work.  All parts were ordered and fixes made within the next week and we are good to go!  Working with Cool Air Solutions was such a pleasure as they were willing to go the extra mile no matter what I asked of them.  I am so happy that I have found an A/C company that I know going forward will take good care of me and my property.  Thanks Cool Air!!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYDZQ7Jp5hjOxx8YzkadADssTS7qgPyXiDNUqn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1582581361933, 'text': "Good Afternoon Stacy, we are ecstatic about your experience!

<text>After our AC stopped working, I was dreading calling around to different AC repair companies and dealing with a pressuring salesperson.

I went ahead and made an appointment with Cool Air Solutions, which was very easy to do online. Madison came the next day and without doubt is the best technician I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He listened and understood the problem with our AC, and had an idea of what the problem could be quickly. Provided me with a straight answer to every question, which I really appreciate. He is very knowledgeable and took the time to answer my many questions, and show me how the system worked and where the faulty part was. We were provided different options and budgets with zero pressure. He also looked over our furnace and provided feedback on our system and his valid concerns with the age of the system. I would highly recommend Madison and Cool Air Solutions.< /text><user>113743696493514815300<//user><rating>5<//rating><gmap_id>0x80db7f3d0770313f:0x821f9d4379be8e71</gmap_id><username>Nathan Shannon</username>< pics>

Cool Air was able to respond to my service request very promptly. The technician, Luis Mendez was here exactly when he said he would be, was friendly and respectful and very knowledgeable. He diagnosed my issue with my furnace quickly, and got the parts ordered immediately. He was back in two days as soon as the parts arrived and fixed everything. He was excellent at explaining to me exactly what the issue was and how it was repaired.<//text>

< Review>
Jay arrived at the time scheduled and went over my options very thoroughly. He did not try to push more expensive products at all.
Installers arrived at the time scheduled. Victor was very friendly and took care of business. My only hiccup I had was when I went into the rafters to look at the equipment they installed. I wanted to see the Overflow Limit Switch and discovered the reinstalled my old ones. When I brought it they put the new ones on. My liquid line was not taped to my suction line it was just laying on my rafters. When I brought it up Victor took care of it.
I had a lot of trouble connecting my Thermostat to my phone. I asked Victor for assistance but he was not familiar with this process either. After about 30 minutes we eventually figured out why. Victor was very friendly throughout the process</Review>

I have used Cool Air Solutions for nearly 8 years. They are very honest in their dealings and don’t try and over or upsell to unnecessary items. I recently made the decision to upgrade our old HVAC system and I didn’t even comparison shop their price. I trust these folks implicitly. The technicians are super knowledgeable, clean, and respectful. They have an outstanding warranty and will stand behind everything they do. Can’t say enough good things about this company, would give 6 stars if available.< /review>

I have been using Cool Air solutions for my furnace/ AC unit since I bought my home in 2017. The employees have always been polite and courteous. They have always tried to explain what they are doing and how the system is working. Most recently I had an employee by the name of Daniel Tietze do the routine maintenance on my units. Not only did he explain everything but he also took pictures to show me what was happening and wrong with the furnace in my attic and why my AC was noisier than normal. He also helped me to get a better fitting filter in place. Truly a wonderful and professional person and it was a painless experience. I learned a few things too. Thanks so much for taking care of my home and my family.</Text>

< review>
We have been customers of CAS since 2017 and have been on there semi-annual maintenance plan. Recently we decided to replace / upgrade our aging systems, and decided to get quotes from multiple companies. None of the reps from the other companies really took the time to sit down and explain the various options available. Mateo, our rep from CAS however, did. He spent a total of 2 hrs with us over the course of two visits, thoroughly explaining each system and various options. He was patient and answered all questions, and was never pushy nor did he make assumptions as to our needs. Merely offered professional advice and opinion. CAS was not the cheapest quote, but from Mateo, to the install crew, they were all highly professional. Mateo even promptly replied to multiple questions I sent via text, even though he was out of town. IMO you can’t go wrong with this company.< /review>

Excellent professional HVAC service beginning with thorough consultation to evaluate requirements for replacement of 23 year old HVAC system and water heater. Jay P presented options and costs, and negotiated an acceptable agreement and installation schedule. Installation was completed efficiently and cheerfully  in about 6 hours on time by  Freddy, Victor and Josh including extra tasks and taking great care to protect our home floors, walls and furniture.</review>

I was very pleased with Cool Air Solutions from beginning to end. Mateo was my first contact and he really listened to what I needed and most certainly worked with me to get the best heating and AC units for a very fair price for both materials and the labor. Mateo is very knowledgeable in his field,  and if you’re looking for quality and professional HVAC services at a fair price I would definitely give them a call. Also Victor and crew who installed the heat and A.C. System offered great workmanship, were friendly, and cleaned up everything after they were finished with the job. Thank you Mateo, Victor, and everyone at Cool Air Solutions!</Review>

<text>It's not every day you meet a well qualified professional like Madison. I was extremely impressed with his knowledge and experience with my equipment. Madison took a sufficient amount of time do a thorough analization of my HVAC issue at hand. He did not give me a rush job and handle himself with vim, vigour, drive and ambition. After he was finished with reviewing the job Madison laid out a most remarkable 👌 presentation in 3 categories. I will say that no one in my history of dealing with repair men and a company who has obviously demanded nothing but the VERY BEST FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES! In closing I would like to let others who request REPAIRS or REPLACEMENT of NEW EQUIPMENT, to use COOL AIR SOLUTIONS HEATING & AIR AS YOU WILL BE IMPRESSED in every way.

<rate>5<//rate><review>When I first contracted Cool Air Solutions last year it was for investigation and repair of a strange noise in my AC system. They came out quickly, following good COVID protocols, diagnosed the issue, and presented my options clearly and concisely without pressure. I opted to get some new parts, they had them delivered and installed within a week.

I signed up for their recurring maintenance package and just had a service visit to do full diagnostics on my system. Jimmy was punctual, polite and proficient, thoroughly investigating all my HVAC systems and showing me his observations. Again, I received clear and concise options for repair/replacement, and I plan to continue to use Cool Air Solutions to meet my HVAC needs.

<Date>1578710512339< /Date><rate>5</rate><text>David with Cool Air Solutions was great. He quickly identified what was wrong with our furnace and intelligently answered all my questions.

I felt confident in my decision based off of his feedback. We moved forward and our heater is working great again!

We were expecting a $3k+ visit which an unprofessional HVAC company would have walked me right into. We are warm again for a fraction of what we expected.

Based on Cool Air Solutions professionalism, technical knowledge, and flexibility I have no problem giving a 5 star review.

I'm a very hard consumer to please. Cool Air Solutions has my business from here on out. Thanks again!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

During our routine maintenance, Jarvis from Cool Air indicated that our blower motors needed to be replaced and the blower wells to be cleaned.  Although we've gone a year since the last maintenance without an incident, I decided maybe it was time to get it done rather than waiting for it to breakdown.  I've been on their regular maintenance customer for about 1 1/2 years and so far, they've shown up when promised and seems to go about their business in a workman like manner.  I appreciated Jarvis' work ethics and professionalism and will certainly use him again if needed (now that it's fixed, I shouldn't need him though!)</review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>Experienced a burning odor from the vents while using the A/C. Called Cool Air Solutions and they had a tech over the very next day. Luke was professional, polite, wore a mask and social distanced. After a series of questions, he entered our attic to inspect the heating unit and blower. Conducted a full inspection, took steps to mitigate the odor and gave us an A+ on the condition of our 17 year old system. Within 1 hour after leaving, the blower stopped working. I called the service desk and Holly promptedly got Luke back out the next day. Luke re-checked his work and realized he missed the capacitor that needed to be replaced. He took care of the problem at no additional charge.

Even though I asked numerous questions around the types of new systems and costs, there was never any "upsale" from Luke or anyone at CAS. They simply did what was asked. They earned my trust and confidence and the right to be my first choice when the time comes for an upgrade. I highly recommend Cool Air Solutions.< /text>< userid>

<Review>My home warranty company used them to service my heating furnace. After 2 service trips, technician said he could not fix it, could not get parts.
Requested to Home warranty company to replace, this would cost me $1500.00 out of my pocket. So after doing a little research online I figured out the problem, located the part and repaired the Furnace myself. for a $20.00 part and a little of my time. I have no experience in heating / AC. kind of sad that there technicians could not figure out the issue.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1590857404758, 'text': 'Jeff, We cant seem to find you in our system and we do not work for warranty companies as they are typically a bit shady.

< review>
They fixed the issue my AC had with the blower during the hot summer months(a bad blower motor), which was the good part. Now the bad...they wouldn’t schedule at a time that was good for me to be home so I had to have my elderly father who has hearing problems be there. From what I found online they appeared to overcharge me for their services by a lot (I later found a handyman who concurred). And a $98 fee just to show up if I refused their service. They claimed to give him a discount by offering a service package that would allow 2 more inspections & replace things like filters. I asked that they send me the details, the woman on the phone said she would but then stopped replying when I complained she never sent them. Then months later I get a call from them that the service check is due & once again they wouldn’t schedule it at my convenience. I assumed they would just do a quick inspection & change the filters. But instead my father told me they were in the home for 3 hours, 2 in the attic. I didn’t see why they needed to spend that much time there given that they should have fixed any major issues on the first service call. Then they tell us we need to have thousands of dollars in services done, including replacing our AC unit because it is old. This was beginning to feel like upselling. Despite having another service call included with that plan they sold us, I won’t be letting them back in my home in the future.

————-
UPDATE: I originally gave them 2-stars but had to downgrade them to 1(IF I COULD GIVE ZERO I WOULD). So the AC breaks again only a year after we paid them a lot of money to fix it. They send a guy named Luis to fix the unit. He then tells us it’s a separate issue and he needs to replace the circuit board. It was Labor Day weekend and he doesn’t have the part, he quotes us $800 (the same price they charged us only a year earlier to fix the blower motor)...but here’s the kicker he can’t get it till 3 days later. So 3 days come and go, I called to complain to the company. He calls me back the next day telling me he can’t do it for another week because he can’t find the part. IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER AND BOILING HOT. So I called around, finally I found a trustable repairman and he quotes me $200 less than Luis did AND he got the part the same day! AND HE DIDN’T CHARGE ME $29 JUST TO SHOW & DO NOTHING!!! AVOID THIS PLACE 😡🚨🚨🚨If you want a referral look at my reviews to find out who I went with.</review>

Any machine or complicated device with moving parts requires maintenance to continue to function as expected.  What can be better than that maintenance being expertly applied and on a routine schedule by professionals?  Nothing.  The value in Cool Air’s service today was clearly evident as per usual, and the technician, Brian, performed expertly with the highest standards of knowledge, efficiency, professionalism and courtesy.  This type of service extends the value of a homeowner’s investment like nothing else can.</text>

<review>Nicholas was absolutely awesome, gave me a call letting me know his arrival time. He arrived on time, was very polite and professional. Arrived at front door, introduced himself and explained everything he was here to service and gave me an approximate time the service would take. Before beginning the service he made sure to answer any questions I might have. Heating system was completely serviced very up front and no nonsense. Thank you Nicholas and Thank you Cool Air Solutions. I will look forward to seeing you for our summer A/C service<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Service tech Michael P. is awesome. Great personality, thorough in his inspection and explanation of the items he was checking on, mindful of putting on/off his shoe protectors when coming and going from the house and attic which I appreciated. He also offered several alternatives to correcting some ducting issues I have, with an awareness of saving us money. Very competent at what he does. Thank you!</Review>< Pictures>

The technicians came in, diagnosed the problem made repairs and were done within 1 hour! They showed up on time and were very professional. I was given 2 quotes for work done and offered more benefits with going with the scheduled tune ups. A great experience and my house is now 100x cooler.< /text>

<review>Does not return phone call's.
A service tech was selling a unit to my neighbor and I asked if I could buy a capacitor for a blower motor to my furnace and the tech said no.
I called the office just to be fed a line on nonsense said if I wanted 3.00 part I have to set up a service call and have them install it.
Thanks but no thanks.
I guess if they cant RIP me off or sell me a whole system then I'm not a client... keep your parts!!<//review>< Response>

<text>My experience with Cool Air Solutions was great.  My AC was leaking condensation and we were in middle of a heatwave; not a great scenario.   They were responsive right away, and when Jason came out for the repair, he was polite, professional and very knowledgeable.  He blew out my clogged line, confirmed the system worked properly and overall, I couldn’t have been more happy with my experience with everyone at Cool Air Solutions.  Responsible and very reasonably priced!< /text>< gmapID>

We called Cool Air Solutions to do a maintenance/check on our A/C Unit.  We got a quick appointment and Michael the technician was at our house as promised.  He did a thorough inspection on system and found a couple of items that needed attention, he explained everything thoroughly.  We were very satisfied with the high quality customer service we received by Cool Air Solutions and their high quality, knowledgeable technician.  Thank you!<//text>

Luke my service tech did a fantastic job answered all my questions, very efficient and left the work area in better condition then when he arrived.
Be careful when dealing with the sales people.
Having trouble with the contractual maintenance responsibilities. I'm hopeful that these issues will be resolved soon.< /review>

Very professional.  Brian was on time and he explained what had caused my heater to stop working (along with showing me pictures of the damaged circuit board).  He then explained the process of getting it repaired   As my system is quite old, the part was not in stock but arrived within a day or two.  Scheduled another visit to install the circuit board and now my heater is working like it's brand new.  Highly recommend Cool Air Solutions.<//review>

Nick Wilson and David Rosnick came to our home this time.  As always amazing customer service.  They check our system to make sure all works well.
This time we had them install Air Scrubber.  I'm very excited about this system Nick recommended.  Can't wait to start feeling the difference in the air within the home.</text></record>

<text>Michael came by yesterday to do our spring a/c check up. Did thorough maintenance and explained in detail everything that was done and what needed to be done. Our system is 10 years old and had never had any maintenance. Good thing we had Cool Air Solutions get it into shape before summer! Michael showed me all pricing in writing so I could easily make a decision. There was absolutely no pressure to decide on the spot. I did decide to go ahead with what was truly necessary. Michael had the parts on the truck and took care of it quickly. We now are believers in spring and fall maintenance on our heat and a/c. This visit quite possibly saved us from having to replace the whole unit in the not too far off future. We absolutely love Michael! Such a pleasant and courteous young man.<//text>< pics>

I am extremely pleased with the service I received from this company yesterday. My needs were listened to, my questions were asked, and functionalities of my system were pointed out to me that I hadn’t even thought about or noticed.  I give this company a four thumbs up! Michael Pierson, the representative who came out, was extremely good and thoughtful.<//Review>

The Installation was perfect and correct, the units were sized perfect for my home and the energy efficient product has now started to pay off in savings.

<review>David, my tech, was really thorough and explained exactly what he was doing.  I paid for their semi annual tune up/check for my AC and heater and during this check, he took the AC apart, cleaned it out, ran diagnostics and replaced a failing fan motor.  I think that their maintenance plan is reasonably priced plus you get 15% off parts. I would highly recommend using them to repair or have a AC tune up!<//review>< pics>

Tyler was exceptional today during his maintenance and service visit at our home.  He called before arriving informing me of his arrival time and arrived promptly for his appointment. Upon arrival,  he was clean and professional and very friendly.  He was left to perform his maintenance and inspection of our HVAC unit and was very professional in his duties.

He explained what work he was going to do and carefully went over the unit and the process of his work.  I am very pleased with Tyler and his work performance and would recommend him and your company to anyone.  He informed me of the air filter and of the upcoming 6 month heating maintenance visit with us for his next service visit.

I am very happy and pleased with his performance and with your company. Thank you for making this process easy and non stressful.
Sincerely,

Tony Fuentes</review>

Starting with Jay Pierce who provided the initial quote and was helpful in selecting the right system for us, to Selina and the office crew, and finally Sam and his installation crew all provided excellent, professional and top quality service. We could not be any happier with how the installation crew took the time to place the units and make sure the system had a proper foundation on which to work.  The crew sealed areas where airflow was not correct, took the time to completely show us how to get the most out of the systems' efficiencies and left the job site spotless.  Now we have an quiet, efficient running heating and air system, all thanks to the guys at Cool Air Solutions Heating and Air Conditioning. We look forward to a long relationship with this company servicing and maintaining our heating and cooling needs!</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>Had an urgent issue I wanted to attend to, and Cool Air Solutions was highly recommended and reviewed.  The representative who took my call was very nice and made sure I knew availability of the repair person and a time window.  Michael came out during the specified window and called before coming to give me arrival time. Michael was very friendly and made sure my concerns were addressed as well as what his recommendation was.  Service was quick and he made sure I was satisfied before leaving.  Will definitely be a repeat customer and hope to deal with Michael in the future.< /text>< Pics>

Sale to instillation to semi-annual service to professional courtesy, Cool Air Solutions are exceptional. Every aspect of my association with the members of this company are 5 star. It is indeed a pleasure in this age of questionable business practices and prices , to work with this company. I can not recommend them with a greater enthusiasm. As a Marine, my standards are high and Cool Air achieves them across the board.<//Review>

<Review>Tyler was very polite, professional, and knowledgeable.  He consulted with the office to fix a potential AC problem, checked out the AC, and provided me with a full report on its condition.  Answered all my questions and made sure that I had no further questions before he completed the job.  Cool Air Solutions installed my air conditioning/heating system in 2015 and has performed bi-annual maintenance since that time.  The system has performed flawlessly and saved me a substantial sum on my annual air condition and heating bills.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Ruben was at my home yesterday for the service maintenance of my furnace. He was friendly, courteous, neat and organized. Everything was left in spotless order. While explaining things to me, the Internet connection was discussed. I did not realize that I could use my phone to check on my system. Ruben was very patient with thorough explanation on how to set it up, access information and make changes when needed. He exhibits a great work ethic and professionalism. RUBEN definitely deserves FIVE STARS! I also commend Cool Air Solutions for their excellent business skills. Their office staff is also amazing! Selina and Mary are always very helpful!!<//review>

<text>Mike arrived on time and introduced himself very professionally. He verified that we were scheduled for maintenance and was equipped with the knowledge of service agreement that I had on file. We then looked at the AC unit and power source. I showed him the scuttle to access the equipment upstairs. I advised him that I had an April Air in series. He thanked me for the information and advised me on a high level of his maintenance steps. Mike was very expedient and skilled. After completion,  he cleaned up the work area very well. Mike advised me of the maintenance performed. Mike offered me a chance to re-up - which I did no problem! Thanks Mike and CAS-H&AC!<//text>< Pics>

This company is great. On time, informed me of my options, and offers a preventive maintenance plan. Everyone I’ve dealt with from the phone agents to the service techs (Luke and Mike) have been friendly and efficient. I’d definitely recommend this company to others.<//review>

Had an urgent issue I wanted to attend to, and Cool Air Solutions was highly recommended and reviewed.  The representative who took my call was very nice and made sure I knew availability of the repair person and a time window.  Michael came out during the specified window and called before coming to give me arrival time. Michael was very friendly and made sure my concerns were addressed as well as what his recommendation was.  Service was quick and he made sure I was satisfied before leaving.  Will definitely be a repeat customer and hope to deal with Michael in the future.<//Text>

We had a new AC installed and we were very happy with the service we received from start to finish.  Jay who gave us the estimate and answered all are question and did not rush us even though it was in the evening when he came.  The office people who set the appointments and the technician who installed the unit were all very nice and professional.  The technicians did a great job and  answered other questions that we had about the thermostat and filters.  They were all patient and polite and explained everything we needed to know about the unit.

Our heating unit was giving it's yearly service today.  The service technician was very professional and did a great job.  He explained everything he did and answered all our questions.  We have used  Cool Air   Solutions for a few years now and are very happy with their service and highly recommend the company.< /review>

We wish we had found Cool Air Solutions first. The Cool Air rep. who came out yesterday inspected the other guy's work, and carefully detailed what needed to be fixed. The crew today solved our issues, and deserve new uniform t-shirts, lunch, and more!!  This company has integrity, high standards, and is truly professional. Great job, and treated us right.< /Text>< Pics>

Cool Air Solutions replaced our heating and air-conditioning systems a couple of years back.  We've had them back several time since to due both the fall and spring check-ups. They have been excellent to work with, contacting us when the service is due and then scheduling.  We've had the same technician preform the service and he made us feel comfortable as he knows our system and the equipment locations.  Overall great service!<//Text>

<review>Just moved to Temecula , I wanted to have my HVAC system checked out and service, I called Cool Air Solution was highly recommended and from YELP reviews.

Luke the Technician did a great job, thorough, professional, courteous, he took the  time to service my two units.  I trusted him for what  was needed to up keep my ac systems. I  agreed and signed for parts needed. I thought that whatever I signed and agreed to, he would provide me a written copy that same day, he said he would email me the signed copy.  We never received any email from him or invoice from the company.  My wife and I was shocked to see that they charged us for parts that was not the same of what was quoted and signed.  I checked with Grangers for the price of some of  the parts item and it was more than twice and some three times as much.  They finally emailed me the invoice upon request, showed only the total price without the breakdown price of the parts, I have to request for parts breakdown price over the phone.

This is a lesson learned, we felt we were scammed and overcharged, we should have done more research on my part.</review>< Gmap_id>

After contacting other AC companies it’s nice to know I have found a company that I can trust to work on my system. Dave is great and really went out of his way to make sure our system was back up and running both cosmetically and mechanically after a fire that almost destroyed it. Now it looks and runs like the day we bought it and the price was exactly where i thought it would be prior to them coming out, so it’s nice to not be fed a bunch of BS stating I need a new system like other companies did. I would highly recommend this company for all of your heating and cooling needs. Their service plan will also make sure my system keeps operating at peak performance and will help me avoid any further issues! Thanks again Cool Air Solutions!</review>

Brian was outstanding!!  He was professional, knowledgeable and thorough.  He completed by air conditioning "checkup" for the summer months, and now I'm already for the hot days!!  He was also very neat when he came into the house - wearing booties for the floors and placing down a cloth when he got up into the attic.  Brian definitely deserves five stars for his service!!!  Can't say enough about this company - have been using them a couple of years, and everyone has been amazing!  Thank you!!<//Text>

We recently moved to the Temecula area and engaged Cool Air Solutions to look at our HVAC equipment and identify and needed services.  Their technician, Tyler Holmquist, showed up right as scheduled; he kept us informed of his arrival prior to getting here.  He did a  inspection of all three of our AC units efficiently and thoroughly.  He explained in detail what he found and we agreed on a follow up to address a couple of minor issues he found.  He was courteous and proficient, and he left the place as clean as it was when he came.  Will definitely use them to follow up on our HVAC needs.</Text>

We chose Cool Air Solutions over another local company due to their honesty in their presentation.  Jay answered every question and we wound up with a better system than our first bid for a lot less money.
I have always felt more comfortable with locally owned smaller companies as I feel that they can provide better service and we have not been disappointed.  We had a completely new system installed both Air and Heat and can’t be happier with the way it has performed for the past year.
We highly recommend this company!< /text>

We have utilized their services for the past 3 or 4 years with outstanding experiences on each occasion.
They are professional, reliable and are very clear on their instructions and recommendations. They did a major energy conservation installation and were available to fine tune the work as we requested. We recommend them without reservation. Our service technicians were particularly excellent with many thanks to Jay and more recently Tim Eagleson. Kudos to Justin for a quality business.<//Review>

Our air conditioning went out in the middle of a heat wave and they were able to fit us into their busy schedule. Tim and Travis arrived on time and were in and out quickly. They were able to fix our unit and offered us advice on how to keep it running smoothly. We will definitely be referring them and using them in the future when needed!</Text>

Not only did he walk me through the process, he provided me with options without a hard sell.  His friendly demeanor made the entire process easier.  When your AC goes out you are not going to be happy, but if it does you hope it is a somewhat painless process; having Michael as my guy made it so for me.  Thanks Michael!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I had Cool Air Solutions come out to my house today for an inspection. This was my first experience with them and by far they are the best A/C & Heating Company I have ever dealt with. And I have used several different companies. I got a reminder call last week, confirming that they would be coming out. I then received a call yesterday confirming the date and time. And then I got a call from Michael, the technician telling me he was about 20 minutes away.  The communication was excellent. When he arrived, he  represented the company well as he was in a neat uniform, clearly identifying himself. He put on shoe covers before stepping inside. Michael was very friendly, polite, and clearly knew what he was doing. A short time later, Tim arrived. I learned Tim is the supervisor. Tim stopped by to see how the job is going and to give Mike a hand if needed. Tim was equally polite and kind. Both of these gentlemen are an excellent representative of the company. They didn't try to up-sell me or pressure me into any purchases. They were genuine and honest. I have found myself an excellent Heating and Air Conditioning company. Thank you Cool Air Solutions!< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

However, the issues still remain unresolved.
I have confidence that the next appointment we make will finally resolve the issues that remain since the day of installation of my new system. I've not had AC in the house before, so this is a system less than a month old at current. Although it cools nicely , were having difficulty getting the whole house cooled to the same or at least a comfortable temp throughout both floors of the home.
But again, I have faith that the air flow and  cooling the upstairs issue will be resolved quickly.  Their on it !! ☺
Thanks for being a stand up company  ☺<//text></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Our air conditioning broke down.  When I called Brian Carr of Cool Air Solutions his technician was out bright and early the next day.  We found Brian knowledgeable, caring, warm and friendly.  He immediately went to work to find us the best solution for our situation.  Not only was he such a wonderful person to meet, a ball of positive energy, a man of integrity that did what he said he would do, but did it with both a heart and with much empathy for our situation,  the installers that installed the system were clean, professional, prompt and friendly as well.  They did a fabulous job.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a Lennox system or any other system that you need.  The price was right, the customer service excellent and they even got us in sooner than we thought.  To everyone at Cool Air Solutions that worked with us through Lowes...thank you so much for all you did for us.  I would give them 10 stars If i could.< /Text>< pics>

Also the only company, out of the three local companies I got estimates from, that took the time to measure the house and insure the unit was right sized for the task.  Also took the time to replace room registers and straighten duct work.

I called cool Air Solutions to come out and service my air conditioner. Tim was great. He arrived when he said he would. He was very thorough and offered suggestions. I would definitely want Tim to come back and service the heater in the Winter. Great job Tim!                                                                        Ken Eshilian< /Review>

<Text>We have 3 commercial buildings with over 20 10 ton air units and knowing the industry we had to go through several companies before we found the best one for our needs.  Cool Air Solutions was by far the best company; with the best customer service I have seen in a long time.  I want to give Jay Pierce, Selina Kaldas, Jennifer Curran and all the absolutely amazing technicians Cool Air Solutions has at their disposal a sixth star that was not included in the rating.  I can appreciate hard work and dedication, but when I see a technician asking how all the other air units are and giving free pointers on how to better maintain the units to utilize their full potential and at the same time saving us money; all I can say is "Thank you".  Surrounding yourself with people like that will exceed any and all times of difficulty in this economy and again to all Cool Air employees thank you.

Sincerely,

Philip Reams< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have to say Michael Pierson and the office staffs are very cool people. It's always an healthy conversation and service. My air condition was broken and they came out, checked the problem, and fixed it in one day. When it time for maintenance Mike checked everything around the house to make sure that there isn't any problem. Mike even went out his way to install a frame around my ceiling vent cover that was missing. This was not part of the maintenance.
I truly recommend Cool Air Solution.
Thanks to all of you.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Just had Tim and Travis from Cool Air Solutions out here today.  These guys were great.  Went straight to work diagnosing the problem and recommending fixes.  As I am on a tight budget, they were able to work some magic and get my dual zone A/C working again for a minimal fee.  My upstairs has been sweltering hot with the 100+ temps and now I at least have A/C coming out of the ducts from upstairs.  Thanks Tim and Travis.  I appreciate it.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Travis and Cool Air Solutions took care of my air conditioner problem the same day that I called them.  It was 100 degrees outside, so I was very thankful.  Travis was very nice to deal with and explained everything in detail.  He did a great job and I will be calling them to do my annual maintenance as well.  Thanks again for getting me up and running.</Review>

I was alerted to this service by SDG&E.  It was a full home survey of my heating and air conditioning systems, furnace and water heater.  Many measurements were taken and assessments of my equipment.  All of the information will be available to SDG&E for future reference.  Recommendations were made concerning thermostats, home alerts and ways to be more eco-conscious.  I really appreciated how thorough David was in his assessment and how much information he shared with me about how to get the most out of my home.  He was courteous, very knowledgeable and just a nice guy.  I plan on calling on them again when I have questions or repairs to be made.<//review>

We had an new furnace and AC unit installed a few days ago by Cool Air Solutions. Justin came out and took the time to show us the products that were in line with what we were looking for and also went over which products qualified for  SCE rebates/tax credits. He went over many options in many price ranges so we had the proper information to choose a system that fit our needs. The installers Bob and Anthony were nothing short of fantastic!. They were very professional, thorough, and had a great attn to detail. I would highly recommend Cool Air Solutions to anyone looking for quality!. Thank you Cool Air Solutions!

I called at 4:15pm to get an appointment to fix my air conditioner.  They said they can be at my home between 5-7pm on a day that was >99 degrees and my air conditioner had stopped working.  I feared my 25 year old air conditioner had died and needed replacement.  I asked that a technician be dispatched and I was given a 2 hour window of when he might show up.  I also asked that the technician call me 30 minutes in advance to make sure I was ready for them.  By 4:45pm the tech, Travis, called and said he was on his way.  The Tech, Travis, was professionally dressed came in a company van introduced himself at my door asked if he could come in and put protective booties on to keep my floors clean!  within 20 minutes he had diagnosed the problem!  Travis had the parts on the truck,  replaced the parts and had my A/C running in 45 minutes!!!  Travis stayed and made additional diagnostic tests to make sure nothing else was needed to be adjusted or replaced.  Travis offered a 15% discount if I were to sign up for a annual service to adjust the heater and A/C at $169 (they would come out every 6 months to clean, inspect & adjust either A/C or heater just prior to peak season).  I declined and paid full price of the repair at $335.  I thought it was a good value and great service!  I would recommend them and call them first if there is a next time.</text>

Excellent install. CAS removed 2 separate systems(1 upstairs and 1 down) with  1 AC/ Heating system.  After getting used to our system, minor air flow adjustments were made by CAS. This system works better than our old systems ever did! could not be happier!</text>

Brian our service technician was absolutely professional, knowledgeable, and excellent at servicing and  repairing all work needing to be performed. He done a "Spring Maintenance" residential agreement. Then he diagnosed our system to determine if our damper needed to be replace. After troubleshooting he determine that our zone board needed replacing. He determined it was not the damper, thank goodness. He also replaced a bad safety flow switch that our last technician  just unplugged and never informed us that it needed replacing. All repairs were done in a timely manner and we couldn't be more happy to have received great service. We would definitely recommend requesting Brian H. as your next HVAC technician.< /text>

They quoted me $14k for a new system (not top of the line...the middle of the road option). Had two more companies come out, one quoted $5900, the other $7k.  I told owner of the co that quoted $7k that I received another quote for $14k, he said "Let me guess who it is. Named off three companies and the third one was Cool Air Solutions!"

Had a system recently installed by Cool Air Solutions. Our contact was Jay and he did a great job. From determining the type and size of the system to the installation, all involved were very professional and conscious to our needs. Installation in the attic was a challenge for the crew but they stuck to it and did a clean installation. I would recommend them. Customer #10336< /Text>

Today I experienced the best service of my life.  So its Saturday night and my Air Conditioning goes out. Of course I figured a week before I was going to be back in a cool house. However Cool Air sent Tim Eagleson out the next afternoon. Wow! my AC was working in 30 minutes. He was so professional and polite. Super detail oriented. Didn't make my access panel a mess like most previous workers that went into our attic. He is a benefit to any staff.  We highly recommend when you have this company out that you ask for Tim. Might I add the price was absolutely amazing.  Thank you for the amazing work and great customer service.

Our A/C went out a couple of days ago and were freaked out thinking this was going to be 1000's!  My wife looked on google reviews and found Cool Air Solutions in Temecula.  Jay came out to our house (and was on time!).
We know nothing about the A/C and Jay took the time to educate us on what we were looking at and he fixed it on the spot!  For a VERY reasonable price.  We will not hesitate to use them again.  Customer number 007224</review>

Service was prompt and the service tech was very professional.  I'm much more educated on how the entire AC system could​ run more energy efficient if we ever had to upgrade our aging units, thanks to Adam.  Overall great experience and would recommend this company to friends and family.</Review>

<review>We recently installed the XC25 air conditioning system in our home from Cool Air Solutions Inc.  Their entire staff was polite courteous and extremely professional.  The entire process was painless.  Their pricing is competitive unlike some of the other installers in my area.  It is impossible to overstate how satisfied I am with Cool Air Solutions Inc.  Mike Guddy and Jason were simply professional, kind and very patient in explaining my new system.  Mike went above and beyond what was required.  He even repaired some hole in my exterior wall, which was something he didn't have to do.  They left my home as clean as it was before they started work.  Most importantly my wife is happy about that!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I called Cool Air Solutions after having received a repair quote from another company.  I was originally going to go with XX company had they called me back.  But since I didn’t hear from them, I asked a friend for a referral  and she gave me Cool Air Solutons.  Their quote was 500.00 less than XX’s quote so I decided to go with them.
My first impression was how polite both Javier Garcia and his partner were.  My ducts and vents were totally done incorrectly 2 years ago (when I didn’t own the house) and they had to do some real manipulating of themselves to get around the convoluted configuration.  But they did manage in 5 hours to get the work done and cleaned up after finishing.  My air is now flowing freely through my vents which hasn’t happened in the time I have lived here.  I am so happy and pleased.  I would definitely recommend them to all my friends and acquaintances!</Text><user_name>Jan Caraveo< /user_name>< GmapID>

Have used Cool Air for both my AC and Heating since moving out to Temecula.  Fortunately for us, the sent Tim out both times to take care of the problems.  Couldn't ask for better service.  He was prompt, friendly, neat (shoe covers before coming in was a nice touch), and efficient.  Most recently he narrowed down the problem with our heating, returned the next day with the part (within 1 hour of me calling to book the repair), and fixed our heating.  We will certainly use Cool Air if/when the need arises.  Thanks Tim!< /text>

Heater is now working again, thanks to tim and travis. These guys were fantastic. They arrived during time they stated. Had another company check out the system last month they told me I  needed a new blower, and said when blower went out it knocked board out as well.Tim and travis diagnosed and said only the board was bad.  Cost me half of what  it would have cost thru the other company had I gone with them. Appreciate the honesty. Strongly recommend this company.<//text>

<Review>We just had Cool Air Solutions install 2 air conditioning units and 2 new furnaces.  Our systems had finally died.  We found them by going to the Southern CA Edison web site and looking for contractors that had met their standards for installing truly efficient systems that would qualify for energy rebates.  There were only two companies in our area and we spoke to both.  Cool Air was so precise in what they would do (new 15 seer units, new insulation in the attic, new registers, & wifi thermostats) and at a price that was much much lower than their competitor.  Their estimate even included building permits and subsequent testing to meeting SCE's requirements.  They installed in less than two weeks and were completely done in 2 days.  We must give a shout out to Jordan and Justin who spent hours in our hot attic getting everything removed, replaced, and then connected.  I have never met such polite and hard working young men.  The final decision maker for us was their financing connection.  We applied to Citi Card through their connection and were able to get 21 month financing at 0% and no fees.  This was so much more attractive to us than HERO financing where there are fees and the total added to your tax bill for years!  We are now enjoying our very quiet and efficient system.  Thank you, Cool Air, for being such professionals  We're happy.:-)</Review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Unbelievable!  I YouTube how to replace a capacitor for the motor on the fan of my AC unit, and Mike said he would sell me the part for $285 not including labor, which I made perfectly clear I just wanted the part.  After seeing the YouTube video they said the part usually is around $20.  I just found a replacement on Amazon for $17 and change.  I feel sorry for any residents that get swindled by this group!<//Text>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!!!   " HONESTY, INTEGRITY, AND SUPERIOR SERVICE" NOT TO MENTION BEST PRICING IN TOWN !!!  My wife and I recently purchased a home, The Heating and Air Conditioning system were over 25 years old so we decided to upgrade them. We originally got a quote on a Lennox system from the other premier Lennox dealer in town and almost made the "mistake" of going with them, I called Justin here at Cool Air Solutions and he came right out and gave us the Cool Air Solutions quote.  Cool Air solutions not only saved us over 40% from WC they did it with the Top of the Line Lennox system, and the Quiet cool house fan system.   Thank you Cool Air Solutions and Justin - You have gained a " Customer for Life "...... I have already sent you one referral and many more to come...............If you want the best service, best prices, honesty and integrity this is who you can trust.
Thank you Justin and Cool Air Solutions........Steve & Tiffanie Trudeau</text>

I recently had air conditioning and furnace replacement done. After 3 different estimates ,  from Sear's , West coast air , and Cool Air Solutions, It was an easy choice. Justin came out and blew the competition away. He is so easy going and takes the time to really educate you on the various choices and systems. I had numerous counter offers from one of the other companies who ultimately came in at a lower price. However, the equipment they were offering was inferior to Cool Airs and they had no other choices. Also I did not like the way that the rep spoke about his competitors and their equipment. Justin never had a negative thing to say about any of his competitors. My job was not an easy one, the conditioner had to be placed a long way from the power supply and the ducting had to be replaced in a very small work space. The workers especially the leader of the crew { i'm sorry I can't remember his name I'm old LOL} were all very respectful of my home and family , and were also very professional and knowledgable. I ended up with a much better system than I ever thought I could afford, and some extras thrown in, all for one really reasonable price. I am a very diligent shopper when it comes to buying for my home, and I did an extensive amount of research before deciding which equipment and installer to use. I highly and confidently recommend Cool Air Solutions they are the best of the best.</Text>

From Jay (Salesman);. Mike, Jordon, Anthony and Jaine (the installers); with Selina & Moriah make
and outstanding team....  No pressure to purchase and the installers could not have been more
efficient in working; cleanup and general all around professionals. Had a few question with rebates and the girls in the office were very polite and made sure I understood everything...  Justin the owner
can be proud of his staff that worked with me as purchasing A/C roof mounted is stressful.... Finally
checked with Costco Lennox  &  Home Depot Lennox .. Both came to house and were "thousands of dollars more on written estimates amount for the same unit retail without extra items that Cool Air
Solutions Offered. .  Most importantly, neither Costco nor Home Depot had the " rebates of $ 2640.00  from Energy Upgrade California & a $400  rebate for energy, rebate total rebates $ 3,040.00."   I went back to Temecula Costco to show them their price thru Lennox, manger took estimates and stated would get back to me as why no rebates and so much more price difference over $ 3100.00.  Finally,
go to SCEdison web site to look up companies that qualified for rebate program.. Also how rated
by them in your area.</Text>

<gmapID>0x80db7f3d0770313f:0x821f9d4379be8e71<//gmapID><text>Recently we had our AC break down during one of really hot days. I got a phone number for Jay Pierce from a friend of mine that had their HVAC system replaced by Cool Air Solutions. It was really an emergency for us since we have a newborn baby and a toddler at home. Surviving a 100 degree day without a working AC unit was simply not an option. So I called Jay, and he got me in touch with Selena whom managed to schedule an appointment for next day morning. It was actually Jay that came in and checked our unit. The fix was easy - it was just the braker that went out but he overall tested our unit and suggested a replacement since it was already 26 years old and it could completely die on us any time. We also have had issues with the heating system. I've got couple of quotes in the past at a substantially high price and that's why we have been postponing a replacement. So when Jay provided us with his quote for Lennox XC17 we didn't hesitate. The price he gave us was unbeatable. They were able to schedule us within a week and in one day we had a new unit installed. I can not express how happy we are with the new system. We chose a wifi operated thermostat and it is the coolest thing to have. We can turn it on and off, change temp settings literally from your phone. Just download an app and register with Lennox and there you go, really fun stuff. Two technicians that installed the unit in our house were very professional and did an exceptional job. They went above and beyond their assignment when they had to seal leaks in our main vent. I was so pleased with their attention to detail and simply the quality of work. I will be recommending Cool Air Solutions to my friends and anyone that I hear is in need of a new system. You won't be disappointed.<//text>< Resp>

I wanted to express how professional Cool Air Solutions has been to me as I looked and ultimately selected them to replace my HVAC system in my home. From the beginning Justin was awesome gave me many options and helped to select the best unit for my home that would also qualify for the SCE rebates. I got lots of quotes and prices were all over the place,  Cool Air Solutions was in the middle. If you are looking for a honest licensed company that will make sure your install meets code and in some cases above code then look no further. I scheduled appointment with Justin for the install,  the installers arrived on time with everything needed. They took extreme measures to assure my home was not damaged even wore slippers over boots when entering the home. Mike was the person in charge of install, trust me you want this guy working on your house. He cut no corners explained any question asked and made sure the job was well cleaned up after completed. Mike even helped me pull out my old water heater and set new one in as I was installing that myself sort of Lol all but the lifting part. Thank God Mike and TJ were there to help me move them as the old one was problematic to remove.  They even hauled off the old water heater for me. Jose did all the duct work and was awesome as well. This company will install exactly what your home needs in the correct size. They don’t guess they do calculations and make sure you don’t get a system that is too big for the job required.  In short they save you money every month with the proper sized system. Just because some builder gets a good deal on a bunch of HVAC does not mean it was best for your house. The home next to me is 500 square foot larger and has same exact system as my home had. Great company highly recommend. Thanks Cool Air Solutions.

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>My AC unit had a problem, called this company and a technician checked the system and told us the evaporation coil needs replacement, the repair cost will be $2185. I asked him to give me an itemized estimation and he refused.  I will update the final cost to repair the system once I have it done by another company.

Here is the update: I spent $151.00 to have everything fixed. The problem was not caused by the evaporation coil.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This place is a DUMP. People discard their trash like it was a landfill (it is).  The recycling section (breathable air) has places for wood, appliances, metals, inert solids, plastics and lots of dumptsters for trash, too. You go up to the landfill on top if you want to dump and go. The sign says "Dead Animals $70 a ton". Not real sure if they were buying or selling "mystery meats".  They weigh your truck on the way in and out, but I have never been charged. No scavenging unless you are a seagull or crow.< /Text>

<Text>Employees are always friendly. This place is just like the rest of California, yes that's right a absolute dump. If they took most of the homeless people that like to throw trash everywhere going through stuff and employed them out here as sorters a few methacan Americans to organize and clean this place would still be a dump.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Large county dump located east of Bakersfield. This place gets really busy with pick up trucks and big trucks. When you first pull in onto the scale your vehicle is Weighted and you have to report what is in your load. I. E.

It's nice as a dump can be, however it is way out of town. I just wish it were closer. Beautiful drive out there in a clear day though.</review>

<review>The young people working there were more interested in their conversation, than the customer.  On Saturday & Sunday both. Unfortunate. There was a different guy working there on the weekend,  he was great. He even remembered what I drank 2 weeks later. I was truly looking forward to seeing him because he cared about the customer.  Once I stood outside and waited for my drink. He unexpectedly,  brought it out to me. I was so surprised.  That's customer service!!!</review>< pics>

Excellent location!! Excellent Service!! Highly suggest!!Dragonfruit drinks are SUPERB!!  When I called to order she informed me that they usually only order on the app but was kind enough to make the drinks any house since I was directly on my way. She went out of her way to give me excellent customer service. She delivered a 150%! I have been coming here for years!!  You never know who will show up here!! I miss my breakfast club!! The lawyers, writers and artists. 💯🎯🙏🏽👊🏾🎐⚖⚖📲📲📱📱📲<//review>

This coffee shop really has the best coffee that's best for me! Every time I come around here, the staffs are very polite and even greeted me enthusiastically. The coffee was good, and thanks to this barista, who does it very well. For me, this would be the best coffee shop ever. Strongly recommended!<//Text>

<time>1602446192632<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I started going to this Starbucks all the way back in the mid 90s when I was a Film/TV actor. The location is great between Westwood and Santa Monica and it's directly across from the Westside Pavilion Mall where I used to read at Barnes & Noble(there was another mini bucks in there). Sadly, the WP Mall is mostly empty now with hardly any customers and only a few stores left open.

This Starbucks is still busy and I always had good experiences with the staff.

I have been to alot of Starbucks. This one is in my top 5 for number of visits.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

It is set at 72 etc. but in reality it is only 67 degrees, it will be great for the summer but at all other times, you must bring in a heavy winter jacket if you plan to sit for longer length of time. You also have to keep paying for the meter and you will get a ticket right away if you are just a few minutes late to get to your car because the parking office is just around the corner.</review><rate>1<//rate>< Pics>

Americano, Carmel Macchiato, or just the house blend is always on point. Top it off with Starbucks whipped cream and a slice of lemon loaf and all is right in the world!</Review>

Very congested
They never have soap inside the restrooms, it makes you think how does the employees wash their hands after using the restroom?  This is unsanitary and raises a public health concern especially for a store that prepares hot food.<//Review>

<review>One of the better Starbucks store I have been to.  Staff are friendly, helpful and service is fast.  This is just beside a parking lot managed by the city. The nearest free parking is street parking along Midvale Avenue. This is accessible to public transportation.< /review>< Pictures>

<Date>1557934159193<//Date><Review>I came in to redeem a bday gift drink. I approached the counter and was greeted with a warm welcome and was walked through how to use the app since I haven't used it in a long time. We found out the gift had expired because you can only use it on the day of your bday. I had no idea. I had worked on my bday and the day after and never found time to make it to a Starbucks. Without having to explain myself or cause a problem they offered to cover the drink and all wished me happy birthday... It really meant so much, as I was having a very stressful morning already. And the coffee was perfect. I will make this my regular Starbucks location from now on. Thank you staff!</Review></record>

<Text>I unfortunately didn't catch his name, but the man who helped me when I went in gave me the worst service I've ever experienced at a food/beverage/coffee establishment. He was unfriendly from the beginning when I ordered, then set my food on the counter 4 feet away from where I was sitting, when he didn't even have to come out from behind the counter- could have taken 3 more steps and handed it to me- and said "here's your panini" and walked away. Then when I had waited for what seemed way too long, I looked in his direction as he was making coffee and when he made eye contact with me, asked, "did you get your latte?" and when I answered "no," he said "it's over there," and pointed to the OTHER END of the store. He couldn't even leave it where he left my food? It's like he wanted to make my experience unpleasant. When I opened my drink, it was about 3/4 of the way full. It was not the type of drink you leave room for milk in... I was pretty confused, as I was perfectly friendly when I ordered and paid. Did I look like an ex girlfriend? The only reason I gave two stars instead of one on this rating is because the food and drink tasted fine.< /Text>< Date>

One of the best Starbucks in the neighborhood, staff are super friendly, the baristas behind the bar are super fast, sometimes when I come in they already have my drink ready, they are great with remembering people by their drinks. I have never been to a better starbucks. They recently upgraded their interior with new chairs, a new display case, a chill wall, and they now carry this new food called Mercato.<//text>

Ordered Americano, went to restroom, came out, my shots were getting cold and the two  baristas were just leaning and chatting. He saw me and said " Oh, forgot your drink". He then poured the bad shots in a cup. I had to argue with him about shots are dead in 30 seconds to get him to re-make the drink.  I thought the reason we had to pay premium prices because it was better quality???< /text>

This is a great little hike. Some good up hill then back down. Very few people on the trail. Little patches of snow here and there.<//Review>

It's beautiful here. They've got a few picnic tables and nice clean restrooms. The trails are in excellent condition and range from easy to very difficult. However, it was windy and cold when we went which is not unusual for this area. It's also close to Pioneertown which is a nice bonus and it's only a few miles from two major highways. But be careful, the last mile or two are on a dirt road. The road wasn't too bad though. My 2-wheel drive car has low profile tires and sits pretty low and I didn't have any trouble getting there.< /Review>

<username>Mr. Borges</username><Date>1560715290841< /Date><rating>5</rating><Text>This place is a gem. Not too far to drive from Yucca Valley, free parking, no day use fee and dogs are allowed.

I’ve hiked Chaparrosa Peak and Indian Loop and they are both great.

If it is hot do the first part of the loop counterclockwise to Olsen Ruins and back. It has a lot of shade and follows a cool stream.

You might see Roamer, the Ranger’s dog. Roamer has a tag that says he is allowed to hike with people. He is a good guide and loves beef jerky.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNZbth9t0TTayiw0X9J1-YnRucwAlYs4f_U2nt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMivJcik5Mh2G0YYjjpsn5-EMiWTuXAJVCrKw_a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

It was OK. Currently, part of their trail system is closed with no notice to when it will open. A sign says that it is as a result of a private land owner revoking an easement on their property. This is not a small deal to me and limits my interest in another visit.< /Review>

Great canyon hike that provides ample amount of shade. Just keep your eyes open the heavy brush and rocks are great for rattlesnakes and there is always mountain lion activity even if you don't see them. I myself always carry mace just incase on any hike or trails. Make sure you bring plenty water for your hikes</review>

<Review>A hidden gem. The indian loop is well worth the hike, as has a changing landscape throughout the hike.  There are even willows, trees and a stream.  Best done early in the morning or late afternoon in the summer. The winter is awesome because of the cool air and snowcapped mountains.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80db2e923aa5f94f:0xe1fe0c890d7a5cba< /Gmap_id></record>

Beautiful place. We drove past here and stopped in for a little brrak. Walked the trail a bit and had a little snow fight. No complaints when you can find a little snow to brighten your day.</review>

The hike into the preserve is a great experience. We hiked from the ranger station up the wash....were we came upon a stream of water within sight of the ranger station still. Water was cool and refreshing. Then we continued to hike further to the large cotton wood trees. Very nice setting. Lots of flowers still exist on this hike. Caught pics of about 12 to 15 different color types. 😃</Text>

It was great. Went around 330 on the Ruins trail and return about 530. It's nice when it's shaded which made it cool. Such a great experience.</Review>

We thoroughly enjoyed our home school field trip and Blanca our guide. She was very patient with the children and extremely informative. We look forward to hopeful future addition of more restrooms and camping capability.<//Review>

< Review>
This was my first time ever to Sushi Delight and let me tell you, I am a life long fan! I enjoyed their Calamari Tempura Roll and their Lexus Roll and the Shrimp Tempura Roll. I even tried the Dynamite Roll! Each roll was so fresh and delicious! The rolls are so good you don't even need to dip them into any sauces.
Jerry was running the show there at Sushi Delight and he had a relationship with just about everyone who walked into the restaurant to pick up their order. It's refreshing to go somewhere that cares about more than making a profit off of you.
Let me share that I enjoyed it so much at lunchtime, that I went back for dinner that same day!!! It was awesome that they were offering 20 percent off specialty rolls that day too!
I will be visiting real soon to calm the craving I have had since visiting Sushi Delight!</Review>

I've eaten here a few times and have not been disappointed. The rolls are delicious and the fish is fresh. Fun variety including a "Hot Cheetos Roll". I definitely recommend giving this place a try< /Text>

Really is the best place in town for sushi at a great price.  Never once have I gotten sick or gotten sick of eating this places endless choices of specialty rolls served at a 20% discount when placed as a to go order.  AJ the sushi boy always says hi makes me feel welcome and is always very professional in his work.  I’m glad that indoor dining is back can’t wait to show my family this true gem of Lomita<//text>

< Review>
A Delight indeed. Think I've been here close to 100 times. Love their menu, full of photos of every kind of sushi roll they make. Good selection of sushi and sashimi.  Teriyaki salmon or chicken bento boxes filled with tempura, California roll, and salad always fill me up. A very kind owner working the tables, along with a friendly staff, especially Angel. 2 wide screen TV'S with sports on. Plenty of parking,  a great all around place.<//Review>

<Text>Great friendly service.
I am not too familiar with sushi and all types of ingredients. So I wanted something baked or cooked. They were so understanding and helpful in order to find a delicious yet freshly made right when you order sushi 🍣🍥< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Great people, great sushi. Today we got a large order to-go and in trying to reorganize my trunk with a $100+ of sushi in hand I somehow dropped the platter on the ground.. what a horrible feeling. I told the staff, intent on fully paying for the same order.. but the staff gave me a significant discount to lessen the pain. Can't recommend this place enough for good quality, reasonably priced sushi.< /text>< name>

IMO, best sushi in the South Bay. For the exceptional quality of fish and customer service, the price is more than fair.  I would definitely say that the customer is getting the better end of the deal. Comfortable and cozy, a great place for a date or lunch with friends. Service is always quick and I can usually grab a quick but great lunch. Normally I'm in and out within 35 minutes for lunch. This place is so good that I almost don't want to write this so it doesn't become too crowded, but I'm going to keep going anyway!

I'm not well versed on the Japanese terminology, but the sushi that is just rice and fish is by far the best I've had in the South Bay. The quality of their salmon sushi is exceptional. It is well marbled and almost buttery to the taste. The texture of the rice that they use is perfect, just enough of a bite to add texture but not overbearing or dry.

Their sushi rolls are also wonderful. My favorite is the Harley Davidson roll, which is a wonderfully tempura fried roll that has salmon and cream cheese in it, with other delicious things inside and out to add to the rich creaminess. Sounds a bit odd on paper, but it is a very unique and savory roll.

Great small place tucked away behind other mediocre businesses. Seriously, come and check it out, you'll be hard pressed to be let down.<//review>

<text>I come here at least once a week. Last Friday, me and my friend came and ordered our usual, same as always. We were literally the only table that the servers did not check in with. We were confused as to why? Not even being offered a refill during the hour we were there. We proceed to pay at the register since we had not been given a bill. The poor excuse of an owner told us to sit and he would bring the check. We told him we had been waiting long and instead of simply saying something like “sorry about that” he replied, “30 min? Really?” then proceeded to slam the check on the counter. He then said, “if you needed the check you could have flagged down one of the servers”. Again, we are here often and never have to do that. Still confused as to why we were the only table not being checked in with. All we were expecting from a restaurant “OWNER” was a simple apology. Instead, we received attitude and arrogance. It was not even a big deal, we were more confused than annoyed until we realized the kind of person we were dealing with. Since I’m here, I should mention the fact that the cooks don’t wear any gloves and the “restaurant” has had a grade of a “B” for as long as I can remember. All over social media, people degrade this place and I never understood why until my last and final visit Friday. The owner has claimed to “value” his customers but becomes infuriated with an honest review and calls the guest “pathetic”. So professional! Rather than trying to help the issue, the customer receives back lash? What a man! What an owner!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Delicious food and awesome service!! Been coming here for years and they keep trying new things to improve their menu and still keep the favorites.  Always trying to better themselves. Service is excellent!  Love this place!   The owner Jerry and his wife Britney and the staff have done an excellent job!  The only downside for us is that now its gotten crowded that we now have to make reservations!<//Review>< pictures>

Great atmosphere, helpful staff, delicious food. Couldn't ask for better. Ordered Udon and didn't get a spoon with it but they quickly brought me one after letting them know. Wonderful visit.</text>

Took my daughter here for her 20th birthday. The food was amazing and the staff was really accommodating when it came to our large family and seeing to our needs. One of the best sushi spots I’ve been to.<//Review>

Terrible service and wait time and to top it all of they made me pay in advance and then lost my order. They completely forgot about me. They made me pay in advance but others could pay later. Never again..<//review>

This place is awesome and I'm literally only writing this review because of the great service I had thanks to Brian! He's such a great server and I really appreciate his good attitude and easygoing approachness!
Thanks Brian! See you soon!

Now, the food: The sushi is delicious here! Can't go wrong with a Tiger Roll or their Tamago Rolls, and it's such a steal! The prices are great for the quality of the sushi. Such a great spot, with a great vibe!
Definitely a great place to stop by.

Edit: (05/16/21) Stopped by recently and Brian is still great! Thanks man!< /Review>

<Text>Best Sushi anywhere! My fav place to eat! I've been coming here for over 10 years.  The sushi is so fresh and good here. I love the vibe too! I've tried so many of the different specialty sushi on the menu.. It's so hard to pick a fav.  Went for Mothers Day and had a great dinner, tried the Aloha roll for the first time, it's new, it was so so good! You'll like this one if you like the combo of hot and cold, and there's no rice or seaweed on this one.  It's different, but in a really good way and I'll definitely order it again on my next visit. Try the Lomita roll too! So bomb! Staff is friendly and Jerry is the nicest guy, so sweet and cares about his customers. 5 starts for Sushi Delight! 🍣<//Text>< GmapID>

<text>The manager of this place should be ashamed for not placing an importance on customer service. He must have forgot that his place is only open DUE to the customers. We received attitude from him for wanting to pay for our bill at the register because we waited too long at the table for the bill. He rudely told us to sit back down but we didn’t. Proceeds to slam the bill on the counter with attitude. My friend and I were in awe that a manager was treating a customer like this. We were gonna just pay our bill and go and forget about the slow service but this manager really put the cherry on top and made the experience even worse. Never stepping foot in this establishment again. They’ll probably violate health codes for the 10th time pretty soon anyway.< /text>< pictures>

Love this place. From traditional sushi to more modern and experimental interpretations of the cuisine, I've never had a bad meal or even a bad roll here.

They also have decent drink and happy hour specials. You pretty much can't go wrong here.<//review>

<Text>I visited the restaurant a few times and each time the service is bad and the servers are always dry; no smile, no welcoming attitudes, no personalities what so ever.

The food; it's well presented, but hit and miss. The taste is only mediocre and not worth the price. If you want quality sushi, drive over to Gardena. There are plenty of delicious sushi and noodle restaurant all along Western Ave.< /Text>< Rate>

We love this place! They have sushi rolls that we can't find anywhere else. My favorites are the Harley Davidson and the Lomita rolls. They also have a Hot Cheetos roll that's pretty good. Definitely recommend this place 👍.</review>

<Text>This is my favorite sushi spot of all time! You cannot beat the flavors and deliciousness of the rolls here. Our family favorite is the Lomita roll and Lobster Roll but we add cream cheese to them, that's just an addition that we like, either way...they are delectable.  Owner and staff are super friendly. They keep making additions so that your finning experience is a pleasant one. Good spot to watch some games and have some beers.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd4a692446861d:0xaa20dc1912af1ba9</gmapID>< Name>

Our new local sushi spot! The best of everything. And I don't eat seafood, hahaha. The sushi lovers in our group loved everything they tried and I am hooked on their cucumber salad and gyoza, so ono!! If you have a non seafood eater in the group, the chicken or beef teriyaki is the bomb! Some days their rolls are 1/2 price before 6 pm, which makes a huge difference on the bill. Saturday nights are pretty busy, and the place is lively. Great food, decent prices and very friendly staff. Highly recommend this place :)</text>

<Name>VW SnowRider< /Name><Review>Been to this sushi place twice for take away. The first time the food was good, but the second time, which was on October 24, 2018, the sushi tasted like day old food and was very bland. The rice was hard and the tempera tasted like it had expired a long time ago. We also order the Mushroom Bomb which we loved the first time but on the second visit the mushroom was dry and gummy like it was not cooked enough. Both my wife and I felt sick after eating the food. Will not return.<//Review>< gmapID>

This place has really delicious sushi! It’s my go-to sushi spot. My bf & I usually get the 16 pc Chef Sashimi Special, a specialty roll & an order of the calamari tempura which is also so bomb. Definitely a must try if you’re in the area.<//text>

This is the best sushi spot in Lomita in my opinion. Great rolls both hot and cold. Happy Hour is great, complimentary miso soup is provided. The rolls on the menu are creative. Sushi is always fresh. It is probably considered moderate to expensive. There are less expensive places but you get what you pay for. Deliciousness</review>

Unassuming hole in the wall location.  Great service, they are always pleasant and courteous

The fish is great and fresh.  Most of it is farmed but the quality is still on par with more expensive sushi restaurants.

Baja roll is excellent

Sfg roll is excellent

Spice tuna with crispy rice is great

They also ha e a frequent diner program which rewards you for repeat visits

Must say this has become our go to sushi place.  Value, quality. AnD service<//Text>

I worked here and i loved it ... But their sushi is definitely something to try especially their king kong, heart attack, Lomita, and spicy tuna rolls cause those are definitely my favorites and also customer favorites.</Text>

Do not get the All-You-Can-Eat.  It's mostly rice, & they have rules/time limits, etc.  Just order from the regular menu, it's fine.  Pay what good sushi is worth, and go for quality, not quantity.<//text>

Got the 16 piece sashimi plate. Very fresh sashimi, some of the best ice had recently. The platter had white tuna, yellow tail, tuna and salmon. I don't like salmon sashimi, but it was fresh and the other three selections were excellent.

Had a very fun desert menu, we got the mint chip with a dark chocolate shell. A refreshing ending.

Great service and a very chill atmosphere. Would definitely come again.< /Text>

The Laker is my past time favorite, but the Baja is incredible and one of their newer rolls. Go go go!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>106464300281998839816< /userid><gmapID>0x80dd4a692446861d:0xaa20dc1912af1ba9</gmapID><Date>1506013337786</Date></record></dataset><record>

<text>Ordered to go and received 2 correct items, but the third item was wrong. Overall, the sushi was not that good and mayonnaise was added to everything, even what should have just been plain salmon and rice. Not impressed at all. Staff was really the only good thing there since they were very friendly.<//text><Time>1500777064092< /Time><user_name>Tiffany Young</user_name>< rating>
