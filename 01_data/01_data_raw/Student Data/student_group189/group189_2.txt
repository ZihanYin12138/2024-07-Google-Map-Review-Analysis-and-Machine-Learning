<Review>Always a great experience and great food,  But I spoke to the owner the other day and he shared some bad news. That he has plans on closing within the next couple of months. So I think as a Hayward community and other city's should coming out and support this Black Business and send him out right...</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>The ribs and chicken were tender, juicy and flavorful. The mac and cheese was one the best if not the best I've ever had. Better and more authentic than Famous Daves. The owners were welcoming and friendly as well.<//review><username>Jon Quianzon<//username><Date>1524641423130< /Date><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

ABSOLUTELY a wonderful experience. The tri-tip was on point, the Mac & Cheese, outstanding the Potato Salad, great. Staff was friendly,  I'm not talking about your run of the mill greeting. There was a bit of dialog about my order. And I must say the lady behind the counter was oozing with confidence about how good my selection was, and rightfully so, because hands down it was a great meal. The price point is fair. My only regret, is that I just found this hidden gem. I will be returning to put the rest of the menu items to the test.</Text>

I love BBQ so thought I tried to spot, I live around the corner. Have driven past the many times but always had to pay whether or not I wanted to drop that much money for some barbecue. Oh when you realize you crave BBQ and there's no other barbecue spot you get a little more curious so one day me and my boyfriend at the nerves and we went up there and we got some barbecue that I have to say it was delicious. I wish it wasn't so expensive because I will be there every day but it's definitely something I'm willing to invest in every two weeks because it was good. Love the music they were playing and you can smell their food from miles away so you can never say it's not home cook.<//Text><Rate>4< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Really tasty ribs! The ribs I ordered were meaty, well seasoned,  moist not dry.  I was a pleasant experience eating the ribs.  The potato salad did not disappoint. Again,  well seasoned, good texture not mushy or undercooked.  It's a little different from the normal mayo-based potato salad  but it is good.  Last thing was the green beans. Again, very pleasantly surprised on how good it was.

Overall food is a hit.  Only negative, I felt it was a little over priced at $18.99 for the dinner plate (4 ribs).  I would like 5-6 bones at that price point. But I get it, I'd buy a full rack next time.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Take your time... Savor each bite... Let your taste buds share the joy of this food with the rest of your senses... (Wolfing it down is a shame considering all the time, love, and care that goes into this food.)

Ribs (my mouth is watering for more) with green beans (wow, what is the magic seasoning here?) & potato salad (there are no words for a loaded-with-flavor bomb).  Tri tip (juicy and yummy) with candied yams (yes! no skimping on the spices) & potato salad (ditto from above). Wow - all great choices with more sides and dessert to try on our next visit!

Btw- my husband is not a great fan of tri tip because most places make it too dry. But here? I had to keep my fork ready to fend off the poaching!!! Me? I usually cut off the fatty bits. But here? I ate every bit as it literally melted in my mouth. (Hubby was bummed as he usually gets the fatty bits of any bbq from me)

Staff was great - friendly, helpful and full of smiles and laughter! It was like being invited into someone's home for the best bbq! California BBQ ROCKS! - this pastor knows what he's doing...

Oh and the hot bbq sauce is flavorful with just a little kick - just as the pastor described it!</text>< pictures>

The food is good  but the the owner is kind of stingy the portions are really small considering the price oh and don't go there starving because although the place is never busy you'll be waiting anywhere from 35 to 45 minutes for your food like he jus started cookin making everything from scratch or sumn.</Text>

Pastor B. is a very friendly and personable proprietor who served ribs tender enough to pull off easily with a plastic forks.  He remembers your name and asks how the food is.  The tri tip was tender as well and the Mac and cheese was a hit with me.  The sauce is sweet and savory, blending well with the seasoned, tender meats.  I will return to Hayward for this one.<//Text>

The service was horrible. But if you're white you get your meal before anyone else and they get offered cornbread. The food is so so. Nothing to praise about it. And the younger guy at the register is mute apparently.< /Review>

<Text>I love the food! I love the people who work/own this place. Super friendly and they take care of you. Everything I've eaten here is amazing. I get the 4 meat combo for like 30 bucks and share that with about 3 ppl that includes myself. The BBQ and the desserts are so good. The fried fish is on point. Go here and support this amazing BBQ joint.<//Text>< username>

The food was very flavorful the mac and cheese, the green beans, the potato salad all with good flavor. The three way combo (ribs,links,brisket) all were very tender which is to be applauded because they were closing within the hour which often means the food is old and dried out. Well not at Just Potato Salad. And the service was excellent especially it being so late. Without question they will be getting more of my business. They have earned it.< /Text>

<review>Incredible. I ordered a bishop's platter here to sample the different meats, and potato salad and Mac n Cheese for sides. The meat was juicy, tender and very rich in flavour. It took awhile but it was very well worth the wait, I haven't had meat as good in awhile. Excellent service, goes extra and tries to get to know you. I love this place, sad that I'm only staying a few days in Hayward because I'd love to come here often for a great BBQ fix.<//review>< pictures>

Best BBQ I’ve ever had !! Made me feel like I was at a family picnic & my uncle was on the grill. The ribs fell off of the bone . Links were great. Had a side of baked beans & potato salad 🙌🏽 . It was a long wait time so I will call in next time but it was very much worth the wait . I’d never have bbq from anywhere else if I can help it. Telling everyone I know 🗣 !!< /Text>

Good friendly environment. I wanted to sample a little of everything they had to offer so I ordered the Bishop Sampler with a few sides and desserts to go. I'm looking forward to this good meal. I was referred by a friend who said the food was off the chain. I pretty sure I will be back here very soon.</review>

<Review>This is the best barbecue in Hayward! The chicken is wonderful, and the links must be eaten to be believed! The potato salad is the best I've ever had in my life (don't tell my mom!), but the green beans are the most looked-forward-to part of the meal for me: so full of flavour, they are basically addictive!

Add to that generous portions, and wonderfully friendly staff, and you'll understand why I come back here for dinner so often. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.<//Review>< UserId.>

The ribs and beans were good, but that was the worst potato salad I've had, both me and my friend ended spitting it out. Who puts raw garlic in potato salad? Hopefully it was a bad batch, for their namesake of their business. But I'm not ever going back, and take a chance it wasn't. I love garlic, and cook with it often  I'm feeling sick just thinking of that horrible potato salad.<//text><rate>1<//rate>< Pictures>

Pastor Bennett aka PB makes some delicious bbq. The seasoned green beans are tasty and try the Cream cake warm. The folks are friendly and the food is good. Makes a great combo!

A year later and I have visited several more times. The food is still delicious and the service is still friendly. They remember my face every time I go in. Highly recommended!!<//text>

The rush that other reviews talk about must be for lunch, because at dinner time it was pretty quiet.  But, everything else holds, the food is amazing (the meat for but the sides are maybe even better), and the staff are super nice and friendly.  It's maybe not as cheap as you would expect, but it's well worth it.< /text>

This place is simply amazing. Came in last Thursday and picked up the catfish and the bbq chicken to go. The staff was unbelievably friendly and took the time to explain the menu. The potato salad was the true star of the meal as it was just unbelievably well made. There is no question that if I ever have another "treat yourself" day I will come straight here.<//text>

Turns out California CAN do BBQ. Not only is the BBQ in a league of its own, but the sides are also spectacular. They have a sign warning customers that they must buy a meal to get the sides, because the sides have been so popular that people have been running the store out of business.

When you go, make sure to get the potato salad. It is, no exaggeration, the best I have ever had.

A word of caution, it is a bit on the pricey side. For a pork sandwich, side, and tax, I paid just shy of $15. Even so, it's well worth it. You can tell the food is made with genuine love.<//review>

The food was delicious and the sauce appropriate. We had the ribs tri-tip hot link and blackened red snapper; sides of baked beans, potato salad, collared greens and french fries. They have seating so we ate there. PB and his people we're friendly and the food was just so soft and delicious.< /Text>

The brisket was old and they grlilled the links on a flat grill.The potato salad was good. And it took awhile to get my food..I like bbq that's cooked there and not at home.

<review>Found this place near by on my yelp app...I frequent this area often and this is the first time I've seen this place only to learn it just open 6 months ago. Break down:

Had the bishop platter which is a sample of the brisket, rib, mild or hot link and chicken and two sides I had the bake beans and fries.

The brisket was tender but kind tasted old....give 3/5 only cause I think it can get better

Mild (beef)link 5/5 not spice at all so if you want a kick go with the hot (pork)link

Chicken was my favorite very tender and juicy perfectly cook with the right amount of sauce. 5/5

Rib 5/5 very tender falling off the bone and juicy.

Overall 5/5 will definitely be back around.

Would be 10/5 if they had rib tips :0) since I am from Chicago</review>< response>

If you like this place than you've never tryed good BBQ! Sweet Owners and lovely people but the BBQ is store bought and flavoring is generic. I understand why it's called Just Potato Salad.

<text>Unbelievably good barbecue with a soul food twist. I stopped eating dinner halfway through so I could head back to the counter and get a to go order for my wife at home. She hadn't asked for it -- I just felt it was that important that she get to experience their food.< /text><user>107545692377691796997<//user><GmapID>0x808f945b1f417e6b:0x5c108d4fe17bb3fb<//GmapID>< name>

Overpriced, small portions and a peach cobbler that's worth shooting the pastor that runs this place and overhyped it. This place will never see another dollar from me< /text>

<Text>BY far the best southern style food anywhere in the US.  I explore bbq places, not only was the tri tip exquisite a tender, best restaurant tri tip ever, the potato salad far superior the baked beans unequaled.  In the first taste of any of it you are lost in delight.  Worth the drive....<//Text>< pictures>

This is the best bbq in hayward hands down. No complaints. I ordered from DoorDash. I would say if you could just go up there and pick your order rather then order it off there because it will get expensive real quick. But still well worth it!!!</Text>

I looked at the menu & ordered tri tip chicken combo BBQ  dinner w/ green beans & mac n chesse. I also ordered lrge catfish 7pc w/potato salad & pd extra for collard greens? Paid $45. We were happy with our food my only complaint is that they could be more generous with the sides! Oh & 1 slice of bread won't help with all that Cue & 7pc Catfish Dinner. If you don't call it in expect to wait 20-25 min. They cook to order!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great service from start to finish! Office staff were great over the phone and with emailed estimates. The technician, Anthony, did a thorough initial inspection, explained everything well, and was very patient in answering all of my questions. He and his coworker just finished installing my new water heater and I’m very happy with their work- professional, on time, and job well done! I highly recommend them for any plumbing needs.</text>

< Review>
Rosenthal Plumbing was prompt and the technician, Chris, was very competent, accommodating and efficient. An inefficient point of use water heater installed prior to our ownership was changed out. Although he made a small error in calculating energy needs on the electrical side, Chris was quick to inform us and no  labor, materials or time was lost since the electrical had yet to be done by another company. The choice of product was still what it should have been. I would recommend Rosenthal to anyone looking for quality service, especially with Chris in its employ.<//Review>

Rosenthal Pluming was able to be at my home the same day I called. The plumber they sent out was knowledgeable and polite. He explained all info pertaining to replacing our water heater.
We are very pleased and will return to Rosenthal Plumbing as needed. The cost was reasonable.< /Review>

The service person, Chris, was very thorough in analyzing our septic system problem, which turned out to be quite complex.  He employed a variety of diagnostic equipment to evaluate our very dated system. Chris and his co-worker, Matthew, patiently educated me about a wide range of septic equipment, both old and new,, which helped me understand why repair work was necessary, and what options could be used to address them. Will definitely be using Rosenthal Plumbing for any future septic work!<//review>

Michael came out to give quote on water heater. I had three other quotes from different companies. He answered my questions and he was knowledgeable and professional. I decided to go with Rosenthal because of that first impression. Michael also installed the water heater and I was happy with the overall interaction and experience with everyone involved.<//Review>

< Review>
Rosenthal’s is who I count on to do the job right no matter how small or large a job.
I’ve tried others to repair small toilet leaks on Toto toilets and even that small a job
other plumbers don’t do right, then I have to call Rosenthals and pay a second time
to get the job done correctly. Skip the less expensive plumbers and get the job done
once, correctly! This time it was a bigger job repairing an outside line so of course
I called Rosenthals! Thank you Rosenthal’s!!!< /Review>

Now that we have our own place, we went back to them because they've always been very kind and knowledgeable, straight shooters, estimates are clear and competitive.

Brandon and Eric from Rosenthal did an outstanding job on several plumbing issues I had. Both hard working, focused professionals and their attention to detail was flawless. They explained all new, up-to-code elements very carefully.
Highest level of professionalism I’ve ever encountered with a plumbing company. I couldn’t be happier or more satisfied!< /Review>

We have used Rosenthal before and we are continuing with another project.
That project will be our third with Rosenthal.
1. Water heater
2. Pipes failed under the house
3. Water quality system

The young man, Michael, who did the work, along with his apprentice, was in every way great.  Very professional, always made sure we knew ahead what was going on, always here when he said they’d be, intelligent in the entire way he approached the whole job and any problems, and very careful in making as little damage to the yard as possible.  Both worked very hard withe the digging, repair, and cleanup.  I only wish we had had the cash (which, alas, we don’t)to give them each a big tip, as in every way they deserved it!  But, at least we can honestly and highly recommend Michael, his apprentice, and Rosenthal plumbing.  Also, I want to put in a word for the young woman who is their secretary.  She was unfailingly polite, prompt about setting things up for us, scheduling, etc., and came across as a warm, friendly emissary.  Altogether, this was a good experience and conclusion to what has been a big headache!  Thanks!</Review>

< review>
Called in the afternoon because I had a mangled nipple from an old leaky hose bib that I wasn't comfortable trying to replace since it tee'd off of the main supply and I found myself unexpectedly out of water. Anyway they fit me in the next morning(!) gave a best (nipple comes off) next (replace the tee and 10 ft of pipe under the house) and worse case (can't get a good join on the tee because the shut-off next to the house is too corroded). They were able to get the nipple off  (the cheapest option) but I was glad they were so thorough and covered all the possibilities.< /review>

<user>112304302650447331753<//user><Text>Chris was very punctual and professional however I was being upsold on services that I was not interested in and after 20 minutes they presented me with three options and the pricing was from $2700 - $1000 for replacing a garbage disposal,drain lever for a bathtub and a shower valve all of the parts I already had. The best was $550.00 to install a garbage disposal and I provided the new disposal. When I asked what there labor rate was they said 125 per hour and I questioned him that it would take 4 hours to replace the disposal and he said well we have profit, transportation etc. I got all three done for $320.00.  It was worse than buying a used car.</Text><resp>None<//resp></record>

Tech was nice and took care of our issue but it is clear they are pushing upsales. I was Very clear what was needed but after being there an hour they had only started quotes for options (including a new water heater) and had not yet done the descaling which was the only thing I asked For. They sent me a text I never Asked for with a personal bio of the tech showing up. I really Don’t care what his favorite color is and felt it was over reaching to send that to me.

What happened to just doing what I asked For? I wont Be using them again- not a terrible experience but certainly a lot of wasted time.</review>

<Text>I thought they were very expensive for the job of cleaning out a clog in a kitchen drain. The service person tried to “up sell” me  something I didn’t want or need and wasted his time and mine. He was here for 2 hours and the actual work probably could have been done in 45 minutes. I would not call them again.</Text>< Pics>

A water heater leak was discovered  inside our home on Saturday afternoon. I called Rosenthal  Plumbing for a service visit on Monday morning; the two technicians arrived shortly after  noon.
After examining the current water heater, it's setup, and damage caused by a leak, I was given two work order options to correct the issue.  After choosing the most thorough option, the technicians spent the next four and a half hours removing the 26 year old water heater and old piping from its location  and installing a new heater along with bringing the system up to current building code requirements and safeguards to mitigate another leak causing water damage inside the house. They returned Tuesday late morning to finish other outside piping repairs on the water main valve to the house.
Brandon and his partner were professional and  courteous. A pleasure to interact with.
I appreciate Rosenthal Plumbing's quick response time to our problem and the professionally completed work they provided. Thank you!< /Text>

<Text>Rosenthal is the best! They’ve helped us out of several issues the past few years with friendly and speedy service but this last time was the best to date. We woke up to a burst pipe with flooding everywhere and they were at our house immediately and worked through the weekend to ensure we had water restored and new pipes. We have dogs and young kids at home so quick action was crucial to allowing us to feel comfortable in our home. We are loyal customers. Thanks again!< /Text></record>

<Text>When my water heater flaked out just before Christmas, I called Rosenthal Plumbing.  They immediately scheduled an appointment for the morning of  Thursday, December 26th.  Brandon arrived on time and gave his evaluation and recommendation.   During his visit, Brandon was also able to identify issues I had been having with my kitchen sink and my bathroom sink, both of which were unrelated to the dying water heater.  His suggestions were clear, precise, and easily understandable.  He recommended the Flow-Tech system without any hard-sell.   His suggestions made sense, so upon my approval he set to work descaling my tankless water heater and installing the Flow-Tech system.  Brandon worked quickly and didn't mind explaining the steps to me.  Upon completion, he cleaned up his work area and left it cleaner than upon arrival.  I heartily recommend Brandon and Rosenthal Plumbing.  They continue to provide years of friendly, outstanding service.< /Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1595528314804, 'text': 'Hi Donald,\nThank you so much for the feedback! Rosenthal Plumbing has been in the service industry for over 35 years and we always appreciate any feedback we get and take it as a learning moment with our team. Our pricing is very competitive with most plumbing companies in the area. We offer our customers free consultations to assess and provide them with the best options based on our findings. We offer a pressure free experience. If our customers are not comfortable with the price there is no charge for our time. Once we get an approval, we are able to start the work. The reason it took long for him to provide you with estimates is, he needed to get a better understanding of your whole plumbing system. From the job details I see it was a mainline issue causing the toilet, tub, and shower to back up. These jobs can take longer depending on what is causing the blockage and how far the blockage is. He also brought to your attention that the water pressure to the home was very high and a PRV and expansion tank were needed. These were also included in the estimate he presented to you for approval. Upon completion of the job, he did a final walk through with you to ensure all was good. We are sorry you did not see value in this service!\nThank you again, for this feedback.'}</Response>

<review>Peter went out of his way to be helpful in completing the job.  He even used his own time and gas to go back and pick up a vanity that Home Depot left off the order.  Peter never complained and just kept working, coming back the next day to complete the job that would have taken one day if Home Depot hadn't messed up.  I'm so impressed by the patience and quality of work.  Thank you Peter and Rosenthal Plumbing.  I hope they give you a good Christmas bonus!!!!!<//review><rate>5</rate><userid>102308321111074968197</userid>< Time>

<Review>I chose Rosenthal Plumbing because other companies I called weren't able to do the work I needed done.  My Tech Abel is the best.  He was able to do the work and more. Replacing broken leaky pipes that I didnt know were bad. He also took out an old system I had and hauled  it away. He cleans up his work area . He is very pleasant, respectful, informs clients what he is about to do and what his opinion is for a more effective system.< /Review>< pics>

<text>My entire experience with Rosenthal plumbing was five stars. Scheduling was easy, Peter showed up exactly on time, wore protective booties to keep the house clean, quickly and efficiently provided an estimate of service and then was available to make the repairs the same day.  He was polite, considerate and seemingly expert at his trade.
I won’t hesitate to call Rosenthal Plumbing next time the need arises.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I was very impressed with Rosenthal Plumbing. They came when they said they would,with prompt service. The plumbers were very professional, yet friendly and personable. They really listened when I spoke of my problem and were really helpful in the solution. Another thing I noticed and really appreciated was the lead guy was teaching the new guy a few things about some of the newer equipment. I like he was very respectful and kind to his co-worker and they appeared to have a great relationship.Their communication was very good between them and as well as to me, to what they needed and were doing. I was also able to see my roots myself in my pipes. When I called and spoke to the receptionist/ office manager, not sure her title, but she too was kind and very helpful. I needed a copy of some paper work and they provided it asap! I am grateful and very happy with their service. The guys were the type of guys that I wanted to invite to my next BBQ, just awesome folks all the way around!

<review>As usual, Rosenthal rose to the occasion and provided excellent service, above and beyond any others.  Abel was my technician and was incredible, as were his compadres, Mike and Jacob.  Abel was knowledgable, informative, caring, and presented alternative solutions to my issue when warranted.  The office staff was responsive and timely to my needs.  Rosenthal Plumbing is my go-to!< /review><user_name>Susan Bogan<//user_name><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x808e15585537e1e3:0xa3f392c6d7ae6c8c</GmapID>< Rating>

The scheduling process for my appointment didn't go so well.  I took a day off of work in order to be home for my original appointment and was notified much too late that my appointment had to be rescheduled and then I had to wait until I could make myself available again for another appointment.   I have to admit I was taken aback by the cost.  I had a garbage disposal and a faucet replaced, (of which I provided both) and the plumbing cost was $852.00, Abel was only here less than 2 hours.  I guess it's right what they say.....Plumbers make more than Doctors.< /Review></record>

Tim has an open, positive and friendly personality.  We are asking to convert an old tub set-up into a tub/shower.  He checked out the existing plumbing.  I'm not sure how he fit his 6-foot frame into our awkward space, but he did.  He gave me three different price options, depending on what we wanted and what we might be able to do for ourselves.  Although, we haven't done the work yet, I would definitely recommend Tim and Rosenthal plumbing at this point.

Rosenthal has helped us with several plumbing issues during the past several months.
All of their people are very polite, do excellent work, clean up, and follow up if there are any issues.
The company is customer focused. Whitney and Selina are excellent, they follow up and keep you informed as to when their service person will arrive.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Rosenthal Plumbing recently came to by home on two separate occasions. Both times, Brandon (who I highly recommend) was on time, did an excellent job, was tidy and quick. Prior to Brandon's arrival, Rosenthal sent a reminder email noting who was coming out and included a photo of Brandon. Although their prices are high, I would absolutely recommend Rosenthal Plumbing. They are incredibly professional and have excellent customer service.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Rosenthal Plumbing is fantastic. 3 business days after my initial inquiry "Pete the Plumber" showed up and was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. It was a pleasure guys! I highly recommend calling these guys.</Text>

<review>Juan was extremely friendly and helpful. We knew we had a leak but couldn't find it and Juan did a thorough check and even did the replacement when he did find the leak. He was extremely accommodating, as we were very busy with a couch being delivered at the same time and our two dogs being very energetic. Our experience with Juan was pleasant and greatly satisfactory. We would definitely use Rosenthal again, and would request Juan as our technician.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I had a smooth and positive experience working with Gilbert E who installed our new tankless water heater.  He was professional, informative and helpful in every way.  Gilbert installed our heater very quickly, the next day after our old heater flooded and burned out.  The new heater looks great and works wonderfully.  Thank you Gilbert for your hard work and getting the job just when we needed it.< /Review><gmapID>0x808e15585537e1e3:0xa3f392c6d7ae6c8c< /gmapID><user_id>115135935126630111212< /user_id>< user_name>

John was very professional, on time and easy to talk to. He answered my questions so that understood what was being done and why.
Sunny in the office helped me out when I needed someone late one night. She sent Jared out and he too was very professional and completed the job in a timely manor.</text>

He knew what to do and, even though much digging in our rock-hard clay soil was required, he got us back on line very quickly. The site was cleaned up very well and put back to normal.Juan and his assistant Alex did a great job and cheerfully got us through our disaster! Thanks Rosenthal.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Corbin was very professional and answered all of my questions. He was also friendly and I felt safe having him in my house. He has a very positive can-do attitude. He explained clearly what needed to be done and charged fair pricing including offering a coupon. Overall I am completely satisfied with his work and would request him to address my plumbing needs in the future. I tried another plumber in December by recommendation who cost less but did a terrible job therefore I will not do that again and have my plumbing needs done by Rosenthal, as we have for over 10 years. Corbin has been the best you have sent out so far! Thank you< /text></record></dataset><record>

Fast and professional service. Peter did a good job communicating what needed to be done before he started, and then what he had done as he finished the different parts of the job. He kept all work areas clean as he worked and then did an extra cleaning when the job was finished. Very satisfied!< /review>

So Jared came...quickly diagnosed my problem...and then offered me a few options on how it can be addressed given my budget constraints.  He did the job quickly and professionally...Very happy with the results.

<text>About a week ago, I took advantage of an ad for Rosenthal Plumbing which was affixed to a Santa Cruz Sentinel edition awhile ago. I received a very quick response. Within a day or two, Brandon O., a Rosenthal technician, showed up at my mobile home and arranged to fix my plumbing problems: I needed new faucets and drain plumbing in my kitchen and two bathrooms, a new disposall in the kitchen, and a new toilet in one of the bathrooms. All of this was done quickly and well in 3 consecutive afternoons. Brandon's work was neat and swift.< /text></record>

I hired Rosenthal when I needed to get bids on a costly repair. Not only was Rosenthal 25% cheaper than the others, they approached the repair and avoided destruction of a wall which the other plumbers said was unavoidable. With the bid I got photographs of what needed to be done, and after the job, I got photographs of the repair. The job was started and completed on time. The repair took place in someone's bedroom, and the plumbers were "cool people" according to the person who had to invite them into their space. Rosenthal is now my first call when I need plumbing maintenance and repair.< /text>

Corbin was awesome. Very friendly and knowledgable. He went above and beyond to not only help unclog our main pipe drain which was attached to our Washing machine, bathtub and sink, he was able to access and find a solution so that this does not happen again. I like that they use the camera to access the drain and see exactly where the problem clog lied. Thank you again Rosenthal plumbing and kudos to Corbin for a great job.< /review>

I felt like they went above and beyond the install of the new hot water heater by also re-routing some of the Pex under the house to avoid some unrelated issues, installing a pressure regulator and compression tank. Removing the old tank seemed impossible to me but they got it out without a scratch. I had the opportunity to shadow Juan a bit during the day and was blown away by his experience and attention to detail. I will certainly use Rosenthal in the future</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Rosenthal showed up quickly, fixed the problem, and gave me an invoice.
I felt they charged way too much, $800, for installing a toilet, & haul away of the old toilet.

The invoice only stated $800 for the toilet.  I expected a break down of material cost, labor, & overhead.

I would use them if you need something fixed quickly, not economically.</Text>

Jerrod was prompt, polite and got the job done quickly and neatly. He gave me a quote up front that he said was higher than most but I found it comparable to any other plumber I've had out to the house. He was honest, and straight forward. I'll call again when I need a plumber.</Review>

Polite, courteous, knowledgeable, timely describe my experience with this company. Abel arrived a few hours after my call to report a leak in a pipe under the kitchen sink. He did a thorough assessment of the problem. He explained what needed to be done to fix the problem and notified me of other concerns. It was a holiday weekend so the immediate problem was addressed by the professional. The work was completed quickly and the area was cleaned up. The Rosenthal Company provided excellent service. I will definitely call them for future plumbing needs. Thank you!<//Text>

The job took less than four hours and involved less than $100 in materials.

The fee of $1,661 equates to $400 per hour of labor.  This is an excessive charge. Based on this I would not recommend or use  Rosenthal Plumbing in the future

I would like to be treated fairly, that is actual time at your billing rate plus materials.  Let me know if this is acceptable to Rosenthal Plumbing.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Billy was great!  He was prompt, professional and got the job done quickly.  I had no heat or hot water and I appreciate the fact that Rosenthal Plumbing sent Billy out on the same day I called.  Billy communicated well with me and I appreciated his sense of humor, too.

The job ended up being complicated and it took a couple of days to get parts, but Billy came when he said he would and did a great job.  I also appreciate the fact that when he saw what that it was complicated, he called the owner, Dave, in.  It wasn't cheap, but it was a fair price and we now have a system that I expect to last for many years.  The "on demand" hot water and recirculating pump doesn't give hot water immediately as I'd hoped it would, but Billy and Dave (the owner) helped me to understand the limits of the system before they installed it; it doesn't waste as much water as it used to.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808e15585537e1e3:0xa3f392c6d7ae6c8c<//Gmap_id></record>

I called 4 plumbing companies, all who advertised 24/7 service, on Sunday to take care of my two totally blocked toilets. Rose that was the only company that called back on Sunday evening. They were not able to come out until the next morning but Corbin arrived promptly at 9:00, made the repairs and left the bathrooms clean and functional</review>

Juan and Isaac were extremely helpful and diligent about installing our new tankless water heater.  There were a lot of issues that came up during the installation that they just handled.  Very professional and pleasant.  Took care of several plumbing issues not related to the job -- clearly they care about their work and making the customer's experience excellent.  Prior to Rosenthal, we'd engaged with another company for the same job, they delayed for almost a week before telling us they couldn't do the job.  When we'd called Rosenthal, we had already been without hot water for almost a week.  Juan and Isaac came out and would have had the install done in a day, but the exact model of heater we wanted wasn't available that day -- they got it from a neighboring town, and completed the install the next day.  Overall a very excellent experience!</Text>

<review>We needed a new water heater installed so I called Rosenthal Plumbing @ 9:15 am and within 2 1/2 hrs., Juan had arrived and given us an estimate of our options. After selecting the water heater we wanted, he made a quick trip to pick up the water heater etc. Then promptly arrived back at our house & was able to install in a rather tight space all by himself. He was completely finished & we had hot water again by 2:30 that same day! Juan was professional and friendly and thorough. I would definitely refer Rosenthal Plumbing to my friends.</review>< Pics>

<review>We called Rosenthal Plumbing for an emergency situation. A lot of water was leaking through the ceiling into our master bedroom. Jesse E arrived promptly, assessed the situation, and went to work. He was fabulous! He very clearly knows his stuff -- he was articulate, intelligent, careful and delightfully competent! We had no clue where the water could be coming from, but he diligently and methodically worked through all of the possibilities, found it AND fixed it. We would call Rosenthal again for anything having to do with plumbing. And Jesse is a jewel.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>I have used Rosenthal plumbing a couple of times over the past years and they have never disappointed.  The technicians they have sent out, Danny and Jesse are top notch.  I like to watch, ask questions, and try to learn something from them.  They have always been very patient and answered my questions.  In observing their work it is obvious that these techs are craftsman and take a lot of pride in their work.  I wouldn't consider using any other plumbing company.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

When  I heard that estimate, I knew there was a clean out closer to the street which when I found the clean out, the price dropped to $99.  The difference in time necessary to clear the line from a clean out In the back of the house as opposed to the clean out closer to the street certainly did not warrant the difference in cost.  I of course was happy to have the line cleared for $99 but it could have just as easily cost me $500+.  I probably won't use Rosenthal Plumbing again.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This review is for Josh S. only!!! Josh saved our family from a rough situation. Unfortunately with plumbing issues people are usually in somewhat of a desperate situation. We were completely backed into a corner and handed a bill of $7300. by another employee of Rosenthal. I'm still debating on doing a review of our initial experience with Rosenthal.. Luckily Josh was able to save us from the repairs the other employee said we needed. Josh is an honest guy, and an extremely hard worker who is able to solve problems with the customers best interest in mind. All is well that ends well. If you call Rosenthal and request Josh, you will be in great hands.<//Review>

Tried to charge me $600 to replace a ptrap under my sink.  True, water filter and garbage disposal under there too - but this is a job I can do myself in an hour, just was busy.  Then I said that’s way too much and it went to $400.

I called my handyman who did it for $90.

But professional, came out on time, estimated for free.  Just too expensive.

I sort of know a little of plumbing but for those who don't I fear rip offs here.<//review>

<text>I wish there was an option to rate separate stages of a job. Tony is great at his job and truly enjoys his field of expertise. I had a brand new line ran from the meter to my house and the work done was excellent and done quickly. My one reason for not giving a 5 star review is due to the bid process of this job. There was some miscommunication and/or misunderstanding on specifics of why I needed the new line and so when the new line was turned on it did not fully address the issue. Tony with the approval of Jack trouble shot the problem and got my house clear of lines going to adjacent lots.(long story) Overall good experience and would will hire them in the future.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< user>

Rosenthal responded quickly to my urgent plumbing issue. I left a message with their answering service a 6am and was called at 8am sharp when they opened. They had a tech at my door by 9:30. Juan was very professional, friendly, and fast. He was thorough in his diagnosis and gave me a few options in writing of what they could do to help. He didn't pressure me to do any major work on the spot. As it turned out, the basic main line clearing solved the immediate problem, but future work will be needed and I will go back to Rosenthal when the time comes.</text>

<Review>Wow, Im so impressed with Tim and Jennifer, they came towards the end of the day. My plumbing issue was labor intensive and time consuming, they could have left and finished the job the next day, but they stayed and finished the job, and gave me many options on how to proceed with the project. I live in a home with 2 persons with disabilities, Tim and Jennifer did not want us to go without water, so they pushed through.
My hats off to them and to Rosenthal.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Juan Garcia did an excellent job unclogging our kitchen sink, replacing leaky parts, and installing a new kitchen faucet.
But he gave us a bad recommendation for a “restorer.”  The restorer was Matt Watt, the owner of the two-month old company “Santa Cruz Restoration.” Matt’s two-man crew removed our water damaged wood cabinet and floor in a day, without a hint of restoration, charging us $ 5000.00 for that.< /Text><user_name>Tatiana Bertschinger<//user_name><date>1442853447955< /date><gmap_id>0x808e15585537e1e3:0xa3f392c6d7ae6c8c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Short version: Rosenthal is great! Tristan is a really helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable technician and the folks with whom I spoke in the office were friendly and informative as well. *And* they have very reasonable rates! A+
Longer version: we recently had a combination of plumbing problems and after getting zero response from another local company, Rosenthal got a technician (Tristan) out to our place in short order. After diagnosing a septic problem (which I'm sure was fun for him), he left with a smile and without charging us for the diagnosis, and called back shortly afterward to recommend an appropriate septic company.
That wasn't the end. Turns we really did have some plumbing problems in addition to our septic problem. The day that our septic tank was cleared out and fixed (thanks, Pete's Outflow and Randy Rohrbough!) Tristan returned and was able to fix the plumbing and since then everything's been right as rain. The price was very reasonable as well.
Rosenthal did an excellent job and were very friendly and professional.  A very pleasant outcome to a not-so-great problem. We'll definitely be calling Rosenthal again for plumbing issues. Thanks, guys!<//Review>

My wife and I recently purchased an older house and started having plumbing issues. Unfortunately we called the company that is advertised all the time - initials RR. After 4 visits and almost $1,000 cost, we still had the same problems. We next called Rosenthal Plumbing.  Josh (technician) and Todd (project manager) were here the same day to diagnose the problem. They came up with a plan and arrived the next day and repaired everything. These guys are professional and don’t mess around. We highly recommend them.<//review>

We have been relying on Rosenthal Plumbing for many years. Yesterday we called on them again when the kitchen drains started backing up. At 9AM this morning Juan Garcia and his sidekick Abel rode to the rescue. It is obvious that they both take great pride in their work and, after hours under the house replacing pipe, all is well once more. While they were here they checked the house from end to end and found a few more things that needed fixing (for example they discovered that the water pressure coming into the house was 100 and they lowered it to 60 - that was a good catch which certainly saved future problems).
Thank you Juan and Abel for the great work you did today.

Juan and Jose worked very hard in the hot sun, digging through thick and tangled tree routes, and got the job done quickly and well.

< Review>
Our experience with Rosenthal Plumbing was very plasant. Our technicians were Able and Greg. Both technicians were extremely knowledgeable on technics, materials,
use of latest equipment, customer friendly, and attention to detail.
A section of old main connecting to cast iron main drain to the septic need to be replaced. A close inspection showed this section of main was orangeburg pipe, a pipe made of rolled paper and tar. Able and Greg educated me on the history and make up of this material, (as I went on the Internet and read about this material which Able and Greg accurately describe. They trench out the old material and replaced with up to date code material and installed a main clean-out at ground level. When they finished the work my yard looked like it had not been touched with shovels.
Eric in the office was easy and professional to work with. And Rosenthal showed up accurately on time. This is a good company which I shall use again for any future plumbing situation.  5 star rating out of 5.

<text>Short version: Rosenthal is great! Tristan is a really helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable technician and the folks with whom I spoke in the office were friendly and informative as well. *And* they have very reasonable rates! A+
Longer version: we recently had a combination of plumbing problems and after getting zero response from another local company, Rosenthal got a technician (Tristan) out to our place in short order. After diagnosing a septic problem (which I'm sure was fun for him), he left with a smile and without charging us for the diagnosis, and called back shortly afterward to recommend an appropriate septic company.
That wasn't the end. Turns we really did have some plumbing problems in addition to our septic problem. The day that our septic tank was cleared out and fixed (thanks, Pete's Outflow and Randy Rohrbough!) Tristan returned and was able to fix the plumbing and since then everything's been right as rain. The price was very reasonable as well.
Rosenthal did an excellent job and were very friendly and professional.  A very pleasant outcome to a not-so-great problem. We'll definitely be calling Rosenthal again for plumbing issues. Thanks, guys!< /text>< rating>

Juan and Jose were great. Came in diagnosed issue, setup floor protection, put on booties, pulled toilet , snaked (cut) all the way out to the street to clear clog. Cleaned area and were out. I will say we had another company out the night before and the experience literally started off on the wrong foot. The guy from the other company walked right into our house with big dirty boots and could not help us since he was not experienced enough. Juan was not that guy. He was very mindful of our house and belongings and corrected our issue quickly.<//text>

<Text>I use Rosenthal Plumbing because so far they seem to be dependable in getting the job done; however, I do think they are a bit too pricey.  I had a sink faucet replaced it costed $599.00 (and that was with a discount, yikes!)< /Text>< pics>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Juan and Keith took a few hours in the morning to review our repipe project, as well as the immediate need for a quick fix on a leaky pipe. They were polite and professional, with insights that were based on experience and modern plumbing standards. Our main issue is that we don't understand the pricing structure for the estimates, and the pricing and estimate for future work seems excessive. The cost of the work that they did was also about double or triple what we would expect. The estimate was supposedly free, but the price for the quick fix doesn't make sense, unless it includes the time spent assessing the whole system. The trucks are fully equipped, so they do seem to be a good choice for work in the Santa Cruz Mountains, on that front! We will be getting another estimate before scheduling the "big" repipe project.< /review>< userid>

<GmapID>0x808e15585537e1e3:0xa3f392c6d7ae6c8c</GmapID><text>We noticed a small drip in our backflow preventer box the Wednesday of Thanksgiving. We were able to call and make an appointment with Rosenthal for Black Friday. Peter was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, he informed us the cost to fix the preventer was as much as to replace it (almost $2k). On top of that, they charged us over $500 to install an $89 garbage disposal we supplied and that didn't include the $239 switch to operate it, but at least that saved us an electrician coming out. While under the sink, Peter discovered a drip on a pipe, then a broken knob. Peter went and got parts and came back, a 45 min roundtrip. When he looked again, the drip suddenly became a full leak with standing water and we were further informed the spray hose to the faucet was faulty. Unfortunately, after leaving for parts again, we were told this additional $251 part was unavailable until after the weekend. Peter was nice to apply a $60 coupon and drywall in a sizeable hole water and other items could get into that was left under the sink, but it wasn't pretty. We were a little frustrated to have to call Rosenthal on Monday to remind them they needed to come back out and finish the job. Dispatch set an appointment for Tuesday morning, but Peter came out late Monday afternoon so we could get our kitchen sink back. Again, Peter was great, but the time, cost, and follow through was less than ideal.</text></record></dataset><record>

promptly responded. However, the option offered to clean the blocked sewage line was the most expensive when there was one that was cheaper, but it does not provide as thorough a cleaning.  I had to ask about it, to get that cheaper option (half the price) offered (rotating knife (cheap) vs water jet (more expensive)).  On the other hand, when their rotating knife tool did not work they did the jet cleaning at half the price.<//text>

Tristan was very personal, helpful, and professional. I thought all the people at Rosenthal were very courteous and had super customer service skills. I had to replace the whole sewer line. It was a frightening thought tearing up the whole property, digging a trench to the street, the mess involved, the reconstruction of a paver patio, repaving the driveway, the inconvenience of not having a sewer ( have to move out), and the fear of the cost. After Tristan unplugged and surveyed the line with a camera and showed me the condition it was in he gave me some options, keep calling Rosenthal forever, dig and replace the line, or replace the line via a newer method I was unfamilar with Trenchless Replacement. This is one of those unappreciated expenses but you have to have it. I chose Trenchless which was thousands of dollars less expensive from start to finish the process took two days I was out of operation for four hours and no damage to the property it was amazing and educational. I can't say enough about the service and professionalism Tristan and his crew did the job was cleaned up at the end of the day, you wouldn't know anything had been done.< /text>

<Text>I was mortified because I inadvertently (cleaning the toilet) saw the rag get flushed down and disappear !  I am an 84 year old lady and my landlady and I got in a big tiff because I knew better than to try and "flush" something that big and bulky through the system...I told her I would pay because I had already put my hand as far as I could go and the rag had gone thru.   She is so ornery she had to put her own hand to check on me.  THEN she wanted to flush it through and I felt since I had to pay for it, I did not want to compound the problem and refused to let her flush,

I am so glad I did because when  Billy came he very professionally explained to two old ladies what the options were for retrieval.  The landlord seeing he knew more than we did, stepped aside (phew) and Billy did his work (after all THAT is what was trained to do and had plenty of eperience with this (maybe not two 84 year old renter/landlord argument (heh heh)

After the augur didn't work, the next step was taken to try and retrieve the rag from the outside pipe system.  HE WORKED.  With gloved hand he grabbed the rag as I flushed the toilet.    YAY BILLY .....I was so over-joyed as I don't have a lot of money to do any camera procedure !

The business owner can certainly take a bow for hiring a wonderful man like  Billy (who has a great sense of humor  )BTW)  but more importantly is both  professional, very smart and a wonderful asset to your firm.

They had to deal with ... a "ball block" that was defective and fish it out from the drain.

The ran their cable on the clean-out  line to street ... and wall clean out  to the bathroom drain.

They said they also flush blocked rain gutters which is a problem for those who live around trees.

While it took longer than their average visit ... they kept to their $99.00 charge.< /Review>

Called back, phone rang about 20 times before someone else answered.  I explained my situation, but he was just answering the phone so he was not able to give me any information.  I gave him my number and he said someone would be calling me "soon".  By the next day I still had not heard back.  By then I finally reached another plumber who was able to come out and fix the problem.  Don't call Rosenthal Plumbing if you need service right away.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
Called Friday afternoon with a plumbing emergency.  Got disconnected from the first operator.  Called back, phone rang about 20 times before someone else answered.  I explained my situation, but he was just answering the phone so he was not able to give me any information.  I gave him my number and he said someone would be calling me "soon".  By the next day I still had not heard back.  By then I finally reached another plumber who was able to come out and fix the problem.  Don't call Rosenthal Plumbing if you need service right away.< /review>

This gym has a allot for you to choose from.
Cardio area w/at least 30 different types of  equipment  upstairs. Aerobic area upstairs (should be closed door for personal  comfort). Spin cycle rm  downstairs (same as above). Free weight area  downstairs (good size). Resistance machine area downstairs (good size) Full size B-ball court, and more. If you can't get in  athlete shape. You don't know what your doing or you just need something to cry about. "O", did I for get to mention for those that can come on base, its free.</review>

<text>Very over-crowded and needs to be expanded. All of the machines are always taken up and the basketball court doubles as a volleyball court and a soccer field. Unfortunately this means it always has a dozen people not getting to practice their sport due to the lack of space. The A/C is also never cool at all. It's 80+ degrees inside during summer and, on the flip side, the sauna in the men's room is always out of service.<//text>< Rating>

<review>Base gym seriously needs renovation. The mens sauna's broken, the weight rooms are sectioned rooms instead of an open area. old gym, needs funding for better equipment but there are renovating plans coming this summer. We are saved!< /review>< Pictures>

Andrew was in touch with me the day I booked the appointment and stayed in touch as I had to make changes to the appointment.  So much so that I wanted to make sure the time I chose he would be available.  We then worked out what worked best...he arrived on time (with a call and text of his ETA) and was kind and courteous.</review>

Very professional and kind. My kids were running around watching everything he was doing and he was very patient. The TV was placed perfectly and he waited to make sure that everything worked! Very pleased.
I called Saturday after 7PM and was able to have my TV installed the next day at 2PM. The scheduler was very kind and explained everything clearly. I was surprised that I was able to reach someone so late, and get my TV so quickly!
I will definitely use this service again. It was worth every bit of what we paid.< /Text>

I expected the appointments to be pushed out for a week.  I was really surprised there were next day appointments available.  Jose was very quick and efficient.  Perfectly mounted TV.  I would definitely could use HelloTech again.< /text>

Joseph did a fantastic job and explained what he was doing while he was doing it. He told me exactly what I need to do if I want to adjust my tv. He was very friendly and courteous. Joseph was also very conscious of social distancing and wearing his mask, which we very much so appreciated. We are very happy with our newly-mounted tv!</Text>

Rick L. was absolutely the best. He took his time and did not rush. He even helped me to move my furniture to help decide the best spot bc my tv was too large for the space. Rick exceeded my expectations and provided exceptional customer service. He was friendly too and maintained excellent communication throughout the scheduling process!</Review>

<Review>HelloTech has immense potential. The need for a full service tech company for your home could not be more timely. When I discovered HelloTech I was amazed at all the services it offered. It was literally everything I needed to get my home and home office up and running in this new “working from hone era”. However, I have been extremely disappointed with being able to get a technician to come to my home and set everything up. I did get one person to come provide a home check, but he never came back and my original order is still outstanding. I keep getting texts about the cancellation of the order, not being able to find a technician, etc. the idea of HelloTech is great, the logistics need a lot of work.<//Review>< Pictures>

He knew what he was doing and answered all of our questions well when we had them. We would gladly welcome him back into our home for any further service calls. He’s an excellent representative of your company!</text>

I was hesitant to try a company that I isn't familiar. But I like that they will come to a person's home to do the work. I decided to give them a try especially so I wouldn't have to deal with the hustle & bustle of a computer store. I hoped that this company would take time to show me various tips including features on my new laptop. I was not disappointed & my Tech Tamil was on time & made sure I was completely happy with all questions answered before he left. I highly recommend HelloTech.< /Text>

Brian was very helpful; however, Reverie sent the wrong part so he wasn't able to install the two new control boxes. Brian was able to get the bases working even without installing the new control boxes. We did receive the control boxes later in the day after Brian had already left.< /review>

We purchased three ring cameras on Good Friday from Amazon. Amazon Home Services refused to install the solar panels and an internet search found HelloTech.  The cost was a bit expensive but we wanted professional installation. Our installer Rainey was prompt, knowledgeable and thorough. He exceeded our expectations.  We are glad we used HelloTech.< /Text>

Tech showed up to fix television. Failed terribly. TV won’t even turn on at this point. Customer support says they won’t get back to me for another 24-48 hours. If that doesn’t include weekends then they broke the tv for 4 days until Monday. Won’t use them again.</review>

<Time>1572796436211</Time><text>I had my new SimpliSafe alarm system installed by HelloTech. I’m very happy I chose to have HelloTech install my system instead of attempting it myself and the pricing was reasonable.
Gabriel was very professional, polite and knowledgeable, and if possible, I will request him if I need HelloTech in the future. I had several things going on at the time and he made the process very easy and was very respectful of not interrupting me when I was tending to other matters. If he had a question for me, he waited until I was available and I appreciated that very much.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I don't recommend this company's service. I had to call more than five times in order to get one call back. It is very inefficient. My client had to postpone his flight twice and I wasted a lot of my time. Find another company to do your job if you can.<//Text></record>

Great experience. Miranda, and Dr. Vista were extremely friendly and helpful. Ana, who did my initial cleaning, was very friendly and gentle as well. They provided great information on what steps to take next in my oral hygiene and general work.< /text>

I needed an emergency appointment my crown fell off. The  staff at The front Desk was awesome they fitted me in on a tight schedule worked around my insurance and had me out the same day. The doctor made extra effort to make sure I was comfortable and relax. I would highly recommend this Dentis to anyone looking for a new place to go or to switch your existing dentist. Five star service all the way.</Review>

<Review>I’ve been going to Dr. Vista for over 10 years now and refer friends/family to her whenever I get a chance. Dr. Vista has always been kind and warm with every interaction. You can feel that she cares about her patients and her team. I live in the East Bay now but I still make the drive to SSF for her services. She has an amazing team as well! You will not be disappointed!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808f799be410ae51:0x1f01ebff82240099< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

A plan for upcoming dental work to replace two old damaged crowns was presented as I left.

Let’s be honest, nobody likes going to the dentist, save for those few psychopaths.  That being said, my experience at Vista was excellent!

The upshot

-Easy to book an appointment
-Easy to follow COVID protocols

If they were a deli I would have given them 5 stars.  However since I was there to have my gums murdered then i could only muster 4 stars.   It’s my own fault should have flossed more.< /review>

Dr. Vista and her team are INCREDIBLE. I will only go there for my dental needs. There's no need to explore other practices once you've experienced the best. And trust me, they are THE BEST!<//Text>

I have always had terrible experiences at dentist offices but not here! I always get the best service when I come here. From Nikidra scheduling me, so quickly checking me in for my appointments and always updating me with my insurance questions, Ana’s gentle touch when cleaning my teeth, Miranda so kind and gentle when taking my x-rays making sure I’m comfortable and polishing my teeth making them nice and pretty. And Dr. Vista always so nice and thorough, she listens to all my concerns and leaves me with reassurance and confidence. Thank you so much for all of your care ladies I greatly appreciate you and look forward to seeing you next time.</text>

Dr. Vista quite frankly is not just better than most at her profession....she’s a great person who happens to be a dentist...an outstanding one at that. The rest of her team of technical & administrative personnel are all exemplary as well. I live in SF. Being a patient in this office is worth the travel. Do yourself a favor...stop looking and book your first appointment already. Treat yourself...don’t cheat yourself.<//review>

Dr. Vista and her staff are incredibly professional, painLESS and compassionate. She has the latest dental equipment which make the prognosis and treatment plan very easy to understand. I highly recommend Vista Dental Care to everyone!</Text>

<text>Getting a crown is not fun, but is needed. Having needed to get two done, in one day feeling determined, was indeed a procedure. The teamwork from admin and check-in to the imaging and “milling” and finally to technical hiccups from computer imaging and the milling, comes time the need to adjust manually. Although it felt like happy hour in a dental office, the teams diligence, knowledge and working under pressure making sure the tiny details are immaculate. its either my body likes lidocaine or with my significant lack of sleep it starts to reject the lidocaine, i needed enough to say the least. If it wasnt for this teams outstanding work and patience overall, I wouldnt be able see how this team truly shines. the meticulousness will not go away. thank you!</text>< Pictures>

I have been using Vista dental for my dental needs for many years. They are courteous, empathetic, and most of all professional. I am 50 years old and have been to many dentists in my life, most of which leave me feeling like they really don’t care about the work they do more than the money I bring them. I have never felt that way at Vista. They have taken the time to get to know me and surprise me when they bring up a conversation from the last visit. When Dr. Vista is working on me she frequently stops to check to make sure I am comfortable. If you want a Dentist who cares about the work they do and remembers your a person in the process then this is your stop.< /text>

Honestly going to "the dentist" is not exactly something I look forward to BUT I do enjoy having life chats with Carherine. Her practice & team are all professional, efficient, & use state of the art equipment.

I have been a satisfied customer for years now and would highly recommend this very well run business to all . I just happened to have an unrelated appointment scheduled an hour after the start time of my regular cleaning and made it with time to spare .  The staff is efficient and very friendly . Dr. Vista is extremely pleasant. If you are in the market for a great Dentist look no farther.</Review>

Dr. Vista is very detail oriented and taking time to explain her services during our family 1st visit to her office for dental checkup and exam.  She took her time to explain our teeth conditions after exam and what steps need to take place in caring for them with options.  Her staff are also very helpful and friendly in getting us thru all processing and services.  Great team work and services.< /text>

<text>I love Dr. Vista. Vista Dental Care is the best dentist I've ever been to. It usually takes me 2 hours to get to SSF but it is well worth the drive. I know I will receive quality care and they always make me feel so comfortable and relaxed. I've only had positive experiences going here (been seeing Dr. Vista since 2012), all of the staff are friendly, caring, and are knowledgeable. I'm so grateful to have found this place! Thank you Dr. Vista for making my dental experience a great one. You really go above and beyond!<//text>< Pictures>

Was nervous going out, I’ve only been out to grocery store since March. But I felt comfortable with going to see Dr. Vista (July 28) because I know she had high standards before this pandemic, and she had time to set up her practice with Covid protocols in place.
Filled out forms online, easy and fast. Texted when I arrived, wait in car. Walk in and had temperature check and hand sanitizer, I was wearing mask and my own sunglasses. All staff wearing mask. Everything is covered in plastic. I gargled with Listerine twice. Hardly anyone is there, just me and hygienist. All virus safe protocols were in place, I felt comfortable and safe being there.< /review>

I have never had a good experience with dentists prior to finding Dr. Vista. From day one her team helped me feel at ease in the chair, asked multiple questions about my history, health and expectations before even offering advice and recommendations. Unlike most dentists I’ve visited she did not push any procedure I was not comfortable with. Dr. Vista spent the ‘time’ necessary to prioritize my wellbeing before and after the dental procedure to ensure my comfort and I find that level of attention unprecedented in this field. In addition to this, when an insurance hiccup occurred, her incredible team quickly remedied the situation. I recommend Dr. Vista to anyone looking for an honest and exception dental team!< /Text>

< Review>
Everyone at this office was extremely nice and helpful. I’ve been to 3 other dentists in the past 2 years, and I will say without a doubt that everyone at Vista dental were extremely professional and pleasant. Dr. Vista gave me different options that the other dentists wouldn’t offer, and for someone who isn’t rich and doesn’t have the best insurance, they are willing to work with me, and let me know that they were there to help me. By far the best dentist I have ever been to. Dr. Vista made my experience so good that I almost look forward to going back to the dentist. I didn't even feel the shot because she numbs you before she actually numbs you. If that makes any sense. Plus the caps that I received look like my real teeth. She has the coolest machine that makes them as you wait. Never seen one like it before, but I will say it's the best machine ever!!  Thank you Vista dental. You are all rock stars in my eyes!!< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Vista and her staff are the best. i’m typically a hot mess in the dental chair and I’ve never felt more at ease than when I’m at her office. She explains procedures before, during and after and is so gentle. the assistants and the office staff are great as well. the office staff explains everything and is incredible at insurance billing so you don’t have to worry about things. I can’t recommend her and her office highly enough.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Dr. Vista has been around for some time now and Vista Dental has been my dentist office for at least the last 15 years. Used to be Cohen Dental back in  the 80s , And now it's Vista Dental and it is still my favorite dental office. The hygienists are very nice and will assist the doctor and anything you need. The technology there is very updated they have great x-ray machines. Also if you happen to need extra work like crowns or Bridges she has the facilities and technique for all those extras.</text>

<Review>As a new patient, Dr. Vista met with me for over an hour to learn about my history and explain her process and patient-centered approach. She empowered me to make my own decisions about my dental health. The evaluation was super thorough and transparent. She takes the time to build relationships with her patients. Mimi and the dental hygienist were also very friendly, thorough, and engaging! Would highly recommend this practice to anyone in the Bay Area.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Flossing and Deep cleaning was very hurts too. I was told that i might need root canal. But they said i will be okay without getting root canal. So i did crown. I shouldn’t trust them!
Now i can only chew on one side. I have to take ibuprofen every day every 6-8hours. Untill it gets done. Well, They did their job and they still got money. I’m in terrible pain every day. I shouldn’t trust them.< /Review>< pictures>

I have always had a great experience.  Staff is friendly and  knowledgeable. I am greeted by name with a smile.  Going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do, but Vista Dental Care makes it almost pleasant.</review>

Great location with lots of parking. Dentist always let me know whats going on before any work is done. Another plus is she makes sure there's the least amount of pain possible. Very friendly staff.</Text>

Friendliest staff you will ever meet -- they will always greet you by name. Dr. Vista is lovely as well, and even made the experience of having to get a crown bearable.</Text>

<time>1515729351463< /time><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Mathew Nicholls<//username><review>I hate dentists. Growing up in England, I can't remember a single pleasant experience with an NHS dentist. I've been in the states for 4 years now and have been avoiding a dentist visit at all costs, I recently found myself in actual need of a dentist and quickly.

I did my research, I looked around and saw who was rated highly and what people were saying and I decided on Vista Dental Care. It took me a couple of days for my schedule to sync up with their opening times but I eventually reached the front desk and booked my appointment. I was greeted with a cheery manner and had everything explained to me very clearly.

The day of the appointment arrives and I'm suddenly filled with dread, memories going through my head of the dentists back home and how they would prod and poke me while I sat there clueless as to what was going on, then being told I was done and I should go pay. I get the same cheery greeting when I arrive at the office and take a seat.

My name gets called and I'm led to an examination room. Dr. Vista's assistant (I wish I remembered her name) was amazing. She explained everything that was going to happen way before anything was actually done, she explained how dental insurance worked (remember I've only been here a few years and I don't really get sick) and made me feel generally more comfortable. So far so good.

Dr. Vista joins us in the examination room, introduces herself and does some more explaining about what will and won't be happening today. She answers all my questions without talking down to me and with absolutely no judgement, and makes sure she's working towards *my* goals, not just whatever she wants. I'm feeling WAY more relaxed at this point.

I'm taken to another room and we do a panoramic x-ray, and again everything was explained before it was done. I'm shown how it looks afterwards and was surprised to learn I have a tooth growing sideways (like at 90 degrees to the rest of my teeth). We had a laugh about my 'wonky tooth' and everything was very lighthearted. We went back to the examination room to do some more location specific x-rays which all went very smoothly. So far nobody has hurt me!

Dr. Vista came back and explained that she was going to do a more hands-on examination, which didn't hurt at all. How is this even possible?! (Hint: it's because she has skills)

After that we discussed all the different work that would need to be done and what *my* priority is for that work. I ended up changing my mind on what was most important half way through, and that was completely fine with everyone.

I left feeling reassured and certainly not afraid to go back. I'm actually looking forward to seeing Dr. Vista again, with a lifetime of being afraid of dentists put to rest in one visit. I really can't say enough good things about my first visit and about Dr. Vista and her team. Everyone should just go here.<//review>< UserId.>

Edwin at Caliber Collision was great!  He kept us informed all the way, and took such great care of our car.  I highly recommend Caliber to anyone looking to get work done on their car.  They matched my paint perfectly.  They even washed and waxed the car!< /Text>

<text>Nice people but slow AF.  My car  was supposed to be ready to pick up after repairs and good to go but come to find out, the battery was dead.  So I needed to get back into another rental since my previous one had already been closed out.  Albert took care of that ASAP and even brought my car to the dealer to have the battery replaced which was thankfully under warranty.  Go to Albert - he’ll take good care of you.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK_dNsaxsENUaA9s2_U4qBUilocU0Q-42Wy4Rm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhmkJIQURNce76y7HKoo0e57oq_fSIVbVLAB_q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnAtntj1nLXIHB-062DEsrS053yDo_JVnBzI2E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhi2Q4D2YVHUz9oNBdsqCX87cSIVovmEN7u8tl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-zKC2IDTTSPEKuF8Mk7TsgYmAsyeUrVLpXnEv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFh4dGonOWHx74nFwv5TaP9pdQGWyncyd3Y8X9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c3285eb612564d:0x13efbfeb5c5112b3</gmap_id></record>

<review>This place was amazing. They didn't have my parts, so they shipped it off to a sister store. My car was fixed and it came back so clean and they even vacuumed it. They even towed it back to me which was just a cherry on top. Honestly, so impressed. Thank you so much!</review>< Pics>

Edwin was my service mgr. He was well knowledgeable and very professional. The work that was done to my truck was spot on. The date promised for pickup was spot on
I highly recommend Caliber collision on San Bernardino rd. Covina.< /Review>

< Review>
Smooth drop off, smooth paperwork, and smooth & quick pick-up at Caliber, couldn't imagine it any better.   David H., kept me up to date, worked with me on email and phone to coordinate all the hassle that comes with repairing a car after an accident, he was great!  Also, the ladies at front, are friendly and welcoming, made me feel comfortable.  Overall my experience although not fun being out of a car isn't pleasant, I would do it all over again with the crew at Caliber, thank you!

My BMW  was  vandalized recently. The damage required extensive work. Albert my representative,  was consistent in communicating and provided the best  recommendations. Albert also took care of the insurance people (you know how they are) with no problems. I will definitely take my beamer back. Calliber Collision in Covina was quick and on time. I recommend you take your cars their. Ask for Albert!!<//text>

I dropped off my car for repair after being rear-ended only to be told that they refuse to work on it because they found repairs from a past accident. But instead of telling me as soon as possible they waited THREE days just to take of the damn bumper to tell me they weren't going to work on it and that they'll let me know when I can come pick up my car. They never called me, I had to call them on Tuesday and they said "oh it's been ready since Friday, my manager didn't call you?" Obviously he didn't. So not only did they not do anything, they wasted my time and they wasted 8 days worth of my insurances rental coverage!

I really cant imagine a better experience.   About 1 week in I asked for an eta on the car, I was actually surprised when Adolpho (my advisor) actually went step by step and gave me a solid date (5/24-5/25).   Usually you get the "well, its hard to tell, blah blah."   Now at first I dont expect an answer bec there is often issues once you start getting into it.  Then I was constantly being updated with texts... and I mean at least every 2 days, and often daily.  Sometimes these are simply "going as planned, all going well."   But you know... thats better than no communications at all!    But there was more often something solid.. "all parts are here" or "going into paint now."   In addition to the texts I got calls, usually once every 3-5 days.   I mean, how often do you get this kind of non-stop, constant feedback?   When it was done- ahead of schedule by 1 day- they picked me up via a free Uber.  Wow.  I was wondering who was going to give me a ride.  That took care of that...  When I got there, the car was pulled up directly in the front.  Adolpho walked me around, showing me that the car was detailed (not just a wash folks!) inside and out.  Unbelievably, I had a dent on the front left bumper (the accident was at the rear right so nowhere related) and they removed it at no charge, total surprise!   Adolpho showed me they had filled the gas tank... by this time I was just swooning with praise.   I promised him I would write a glowing review.  Here it is, you guys TOTALLY deserve it and knocked it out of the ballpark!

<review>DONT EVER COME HERE !!!! I took my car in to get fixed after i was referred  by my 21 century insurance agent and it was the worst decision I made.I took my car in Jan.28 and didn't get it till March 21 and it was suppose to be ready according to them March9. I would get weekly updates by Luis. A week before my car is suppose to be ready Luis tells me everything is going good and they are even trying to get it done before March 9 which was a complete and utter lie because they were still waiting on a bench to install a part and no way they can get it done by March 9 and I was never informed until March 7 two days before my car was suppose to be ready that it might take extra week or so.
Which turned to two weeks. So I spoke to manager Hector which gave me an update and literally said "Well you aren't the only car we are working on" would be nice to know if they aren't capable of fixing car in time let the customer know
So if u want to drop off the car to be fixed and not know anything about what's going on and having to literally harass them for information this is the place for you. I even had to speak to regional manager Steve but that didn't go anywhere all he said he is going to talk to his staff and if all I needed was to vent to him cuz "what did I want him to do?" And then said well it's because usually people have a rental car and don't worry about how long it takes as long as it gets fixed. Well, I'm sorry when it's passed ur deadline March 9, I think it's customers right to know exactly what is going on with ur car that's causing a delay.<//review><response>{'time': 1524148172542, 'text': "Hi Jonathan Crisologo, thank you for your feedback.

<Review>Strictly Plumbers have been helping me with my marketing for a couple of years now and from the beginning to now Tony Gee and staff have been awesome. Being a business owner its hard to find a company that can understand your plumbing marketing needs, but with Strictly Plumbers they make it really easy because they understand the plumbing market. Every month they keep me updated on how we did and what we can improve. When I talk to Oliver he always has great ideas to stand out in this plumbing market. What I can tell you also is that my phone rings everyday and I'm always helping a customer with all there plumbing needs.
Thank you Strictly Plumbers for being my marketing team.You guys stand by what you say when getting lots of  plumbing calls.
Thank you.

This is jesse Fernandez the manager here at Strictly Plumbers.
I never believed in Marketing until I ran across Tony G.  He talked to me for months and i finally asked him to show me how this Marketing thing works.

Well This well oiled Machine of Strictly Plumbers actually really works, with Website Design, SEO, Google and Google my business, PPC, and  Facebook.  Through results I have experienced in plumbing companies we Service I became part of Tony’s amazing team of 20 and became his Manager.   I have never been part of such an Amazing company, working together as a team toward the same goal.
I Thrive in the results we get our plumbers and really enjoy what I do as part of the Strictly Plumbers Family.<//Text>

< Review>
This was the ultimate knock down, drag out WWF fight of my career. Tony, Oliver and I battled it out for nearly two months, but Strictly Plumbers never gave up, and they delivered an awesome website! My hats off for going above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a great product and putting in the extra hours to get it done!

I may have not been their easiest client, but I demand great service from companies that I deal with. It's the same level of service I deliver time after time to my clients. Except nothing less! Up, or down these guys really delivered!

I think in the long run we all learned a valuable lesson. Expectations need to be met, or the customer will not be happy and reviews will reflect that. It was a long road, but we got there. I didn't love the process, but I love the product.

Thanks again guys and gals!<//Review>

Tony and crew are amazing. Their onboarding process was very organized and efficient. The design team did an excellent job on our site. Before Strictly Plumbers our website wasn’t working for us. If you have a plumbing company, you owe it to yourself to hire Tony and crew at Strictly Plumbers. You won’t be disappointed.<//review>

1. Tony Gee has a team that works to get you the results you want, fast.
2. Upfront pricing. He provides different tiers on his website depending on how big of a company you are and the results you are looking for.
3. FAST turnaround time. I hired his company to create a brand new identity I want to implement this Fall. Queenie was the representative who let me know every few days how things were going. The graphics designer made the edits I requested without complaint.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting a lot out of the brand redesign, but I was floored after seeing the results.

Keep in mind, I am not a customer but was inquiring about their services. for my plumbing company. Tony Gee keeps on saying he was a plumber and knows what to do. What he doesn't mention that the websites he builds has duplicate content and almost every site looks the same with the same content.

Google does not like duplicate content. Buyer be ware!< /Review>

Tony is very knowledgeable about plumbing being a former plumber himself. It made my website build process much easier and smoother. Him being a plumber is also an advantage in the back end stuff that most web designers would not know.</Text>

Strictly plumbing had been a Tremendous addition to our marketing. They have really helped our business connect directly with quality leads in a way that has allowed us to deviate from wasteful marketing spending. Tony and his team are responsive and helpful with all of our needs. I am excited in the direction I see our business going. I attribute much of our success to Stricktly Plumbing. I only wish I would’ve met them sooner.</Review>

<Date>1575560958992<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I own a plumbing company in Los Angeles, CA called Aragon Plumbing. We hire Tony Gee from Strictly Plumbers about 9 months ago and they built my new plumbing website that came out amazing, it’s way better than my old website. I recently hired Strictly Plumbers for SEO after they gained my trust and built my killer website I gave them a shot with SEO and I can see the hard work. I’m really happy with service .

Tony Gee was a plumber first 15yrs and it shows, There’s a huge difference when you hire Strictly Plumbers Marketing VS other marketing agencies. The plumbing background is a game changer for me, this company really understands my plumbing company and they are true EXPERTS in marketing for Plumbers.

If you own a plumbing company and need marketing, you MUST speak with Tony Gee.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I own Matrix Plumbing and ever since I hired Strictly Plumbers I have been able to double the amount of calls within 60 days. Tony Gee was a Plumber in the past and it shows, i ask for water leaks and I get water leaks, I ask for tankless water heater calls and that’s what I get. I’m so impressed by the powerful results. If you own a plumbing company and need more plumbing calls, Tony Gee the owner of Strictly Plumbers runs the #1 marketing agency for Plumbers. This month alone we have made $200k and its only been 13 days. This marketing has not only helped my plumbing company grow but it has also changed my life. Thank you Tony Gee and Strictly Plumbers</Review>

We recently hire strickly plumbers to handle our marketing. In doing so within the first two weeks Tony has made himself completely available to the needs of our campaign. He has also gone above the call of duty (in my opinion) by returning my phone calls late evenings.
I believe we have made the best investment with our marketing dollar in today’s market.<//review>

I began at this gym a little under a year ago after 3 years of powerlifting as a hobby.  I considered myself to be about as strong as I'd ever be naturally, but after spending time with many of the talented people who both work and attend here, I'm a significantly stronger and more knowledgeable person.  This gym is THE place to go for anyone in San Diego who is serious about their strength and fitness.  This gym's leaders and community members will take your training as seriously as you do, and will inspire you to push your limits and accomplish things you didn't think yourself capable of.  Highly recommend!<//text>

<user_id>115466358943404092746</user_id><rate>5</rate><Review>Excellent facility. The left side is focused around cardio and CrossFit type stuff. The right side is all about bodybuilding and powerlifting.

They have a good variety of amount of equipment, weight, and accessories (chains, deadlift bar, etc.), so you're going to be able to get your training done well here.

I've used this gym for my powerlifting training sessions several times over the past couple of years when I'm in the area, driving about 40 mins to get here. Good parking, fairly close off highway, and friendly staff.<//Review>< Pics>

I really enjoyed working out here while I was a member, they stayed open during Covid, great place to release some stress and get out of the house. Well equipped gym, nothing fancy but gets the job done.

One star review for the fact that I've cancelled my membership in Nov 2020 and I'm STILL being charged monthly. They told me my membership was cancelled, but I'm still getting charged every month. The gym owners do not respond to calls or emails. Chase is no longer doing stop-payments on accounts, so now I'm stuck disputing the charges every month.

There are SO many other gym in SD that take running a business seriously, spend your money elsewhere.</Text>

I felt it necessary to leave a review of my experience at this gym so people know that it is not for everyone.

I was a member at this gym and also worked as a part-time personal trainer.

I was treated as a friend in the beginning except for the usual owner of the gym Gracie who treated me with poor customer service.

One, I’ve heard stories about the owner and her abrasive behavior towards others. you are not allowed to wear a mask at her gym though that is not my preference this is discrimination for those of us that prefer to be or feel safer.

Biggest problem I experienced was I felt uncomfortable in this gym and when the girl at the front desk told me that I could use a gym for the rest of the day after I canceled I was confronted by two other staff members asking me the same question drilling me and getting in my face about me canceling the gym and still using it later that evening.

This gym is very clicky this gym is very dramatic the owner has no clue how to have proper customer service and even the manager has Napoleon syndrome. He is unfriendly does not say hi when you greet him and stares you down like you’ve done something wrong.

I hesitate to give a small business and negative review as I have been a small business owner in the past but customer service is number one and the Staff at this gym do not communicate with each other obviously and do not have proper customer service you are better off going to another gym were you will not be harassed when you have done nothing wrong</text>

Lots of equipment,  great variety,  classes available.  Trainers can work their personal training for a 'rent type' fee or session fee.
Great place for serious lifting.

Whenever I'm in the San Diego area this is the gym I MUST go to!! My coach is the owner of the gym and she is great! She has really helped me post surgery become a much stronger lifter!

If you live even remotely close and don't train at this gym you should come by and realize what you're missing out on. This gym has everything you need to better yourself whether you're a competitive powerlifter/strongman/Olympic lifter, or just wanting to better yourself. The coaches are great, the gym and its members are very helpful. The specialty equipment found here is cutting edge. I highly suggest you come by for a visit and see what CETC can offer you.<//text>

This is the nicest gym in SD not to mention Southern California. If you powerlift, or do crossfit this is the spot to train. This gym has everything you could possibly want. The equipment is top of the line. If you train conjugate this should be your home, I couldn't imagine a better place to train when in SD.< /text>

<Text>By far the best gym I've been to! Top notch equipment and super motivating environment. Very family friendly with a lot of options for different types of training  (powerlifting, crossfit, bodybuilding).

This place has the best variety of specialty and standard equipment, Crossfit area, tons of training space, legit parking, and qualified coaching staff. What's not to love?? Come check it out, prices are very competitive.</Review>< Pictures>

California Elite Training Center cators towards personal goals and self development. Gracie and staff strive to provide the tools and equipment to make people better. As a powerlifter, this is a fantastic place to achieve personal goals. It has all the specialty equipment one could ask for including a monolift and deadlift platform. Members are very supportive of each other creating a family-like feel. Gracie also offers strength based crossfit. She knows what she's doing and there's a reason why she's one of the best in the industry. No matter what level of fitness you are at, I would highly recommend California Elite Training Center to achieve personal goals.<//Text>

Badass gym for serious athletes and home of the DCS Pack.  If you're committed and willing to learn you will grow exponentially at this gym as an athlete.  Whether you are a powerlifter, into CrossFit,  an Oly competitor, or just like lifting heavy things the staff works hard at making you feel right at home.</text>

This is hands down the best gym in socal I have ever seen or been to. Not only the equipment but the people are amazing. I haven't been to a gym where I was intimidated to go to like I was at this gym but as soon as I got inside that all changed thanks to the kind inviting people that probably saw the intimidation I was feeling and before I knew it I was one of them loaded up under a monolift for the first time doin some skwaats! 😉 I had to many questions when I first joined on the equipment/specialty bars etc... and especially when I joined the DCS mens pack and saw new exercises daily that I had never done before. I thought I had pretty much done or at least heard of everything I would encounter here coming from bodybuilding to powerlifting was a big eye opener and I'm stronger happier and healthier after joining CETC and it's great because I'm a single dad and my kids can come and hangout in the kid room and do homework or watch movies while I train. They also have a no BS approach to the gym atmosphere, meaning they don't mind if you want to do something most commercial gyms might freak out for as long as it's respecting everyone else and the gym the sky's the limit and Gracie has been open and available almost 24/7 (apparently she has to sleep or something, whatever)😉.< /review>

The only Starbucks that is fast and make the drinks as tasty as possible not like other Starbucks in Imperial Valley that makes you wait long time for your drinks and no flavor like Brawley for example they make your drinks flavorless most of the time< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>I can’t believe I have a drink not even near to what a real Starbucks is. I ordered  white hot chocolate with mint.  I got a cup of milk with small amount pieces of dark chocolate. This is my second and last worse experience at this store in imperial because I will never visit that place again. The drinks are prepared with too much ice that water down the flavor and little of the real products. It seems like they are trying to save products or something by doing this. I have been at the world largest Starbucks store and many others and never experienced something so bad. A cup of milk is not a white hot chocolate people. Visit real places and you will experience the real taste and flavored hot chocolate.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Great service and coffee. Wait times not great, after 15 minutes you start to regret getting in line but now can't get out. I would like them to find a way to expedite things. The only complaint comes with wait time which is a byproduct of demand, if you are willing to wait for quality then this is the place for you (they could be quicker though).< /review>

Good coffee. Service although friendly cannot get my orders right! Too much sweetener, too much ice! I asked for unsweetened and got sweeten! Staff needs to remove their earpieces so that they can hear better.< /text>

I call on a daily to get info on there products and not once have they picked up the phone. I’m forced to make line just to ask if they have any of their products available. Store manager please address this.. your location is the only store that doesn’t pick up.< /review>

You know what it is, there is no real reason to review it. Same softness and bland emptiness to go along the sweetness of augar and legal uppers. They did just fine, the employees are great. Thankless kind of career where you just get polite thanks and no real appreciation. Leave a nice tip in the jar for working Americans.</Review>< Pictures>

I like the staff and the beautiful new store BUT the flaw i found going here is the drive through.  People try and line up from 2 different directions resulting in blocking other cars and people getting upset because they think you cut in line.  When there is no line in drive through its great but if there is a line... Do yourself a favor just drive to the next Starbucks and avoid the frustration.  5 stars once they did this problem 👍</Text>

I enjoy this Starbucks location because it is not crowded and the atmosphere at this store is conducive for getting work done. Also, the baristas are very welcoming and cheerful.<//review>

There was a fly inside the bread display, tables were not properly wiped clean, and there were bread crumbs on the tables along with the chairs.< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>In-n-Out is been a stable during road trips visiting families in Southern California. This is no exception, cheeseburger and fries for four, fresh veggies, beef cooked just right and animal style takes it to another level of tasty burger. Due to COVID-19 self serve drink station was closed, you could still get refills and water. Good service, staff was very welcoming while they take your order.<//text>< Pics>

A California institution. I grew up in Southern California and now only pass through; however, I always make a point stopping at an In-N-Out Burger at least once. My usual order is a 3x3 and well-done fries (animal style) and I am rarely (if ever) disappointed.< /review>

Covid update 5/2021:
Drive through and limited dine in with 6 feet social distance available. Plenty of outdoor seating with umbrella shades. Long drive through lines but there is a clerk walking up and down drive through line to speed up process.

Plenty of parking for cars and SUV. RV and Semi will need to park at the lower open lot and walk up. Orders are relatively fast. Ordering lines can extend out side but it moves fairly quick. Very tasty French fries thats quite unique in texture. They offer Coke products.</review>

<text>It was nice to sit down in the restaurant and actually eat like a human being instead of some type of masked minion that has to eat outside with the animals, I didn't mean to speak ill of the ruling Elite since they can do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do wherever they want to do it</text><Response>None< /Response><user>115069099739058706909</user>< username>

Were looking for a stop on the road through CA and this was the best option.  Super fast service and super clean bathrooms.  The food was the same as usual with in and out, great stop if you are driving through.<//review>

Delicious food as always.  The employee who took my order was friendly, courteous and helpful in customizing my order.  I had opted to go inside to order since there was a long line at the drive through.  I did not have to wait long for my food.  All of  the employees were wearing gloves and masks and they all seemed to work well with each other while each one was busy with their own task.  I've noticed that all In-N-Out employees, for the most part, work hard and seem happy. The Kettlmen City, California location is no exception.  Thank you In-N-Out for a great eating out experience.< /text>

I've never understood the hype around in-n-out.  Their burgers are just ok. Their fries taste undercooked.  If I need to order from a secret menu then why not make it the main menu?
They do have really good prices which is why I give them 3 stars, but overall their burgers don't break my fast food top 10.< /Review>

The person in the front taking our order, put down my protein wrapped Hamburger. Your line is so long when you asked to fix , you knew it was a joke.  Now my husband is mad at me and won't eat because im not happy. Thanks. Y'all may be overworked.</Review>

Ok were in Covid . We are on a road trip. Travel restrictions are lifted. Were in Kettleman City. Pretty much an armpit... RIGHT!   We have been driving for about 4 hrs or so need a potty break. All the other businesses really locked down Sorry no bathroom service oh but you can spend your money. Which i think is Big Bull malarkey.
Thank the lord for In & Out because that is what its all about..
Clean  stocked up restrooms courteous employees and oh my the single patty burger with grilled onions 🌰  was yum 😋  ie. Thank you Kettleman in and out. God bless and keep your selfs safe.<//text>

<Text>11/20/2020 the lines are long, but thanks to In-N-Out in their ruthless efficiency the wait time is fairly short

It's worth noting that due to Covid the indoor seating is closed, and they're only letting a limited number of people inside at a time for takeout - so there's a line at the door.

One bonus is that at least this store takes Google/Samsung/Apple Pay</Text>< user>

In-N-Out Burger is the most consistent in quality of all burger stands. This includes A & W which I think has the best Double Bacon Cheeseburger anywhere.  But they have a couple of places that are not as good as they should be.   IN-N-OUT Burgers are all the same all menus are the same and the quality of their products are very very good.</review>

In-N-Out never disappoints. Most people will take their orders to go, so be warned. The drive thru lines are quite long. It took us about 45 minutes from when we got in line, till when he left with our food.

But the food. My oh my was it good. The food is always good, just the wait is what was bad. The saying good things come to those who wait is true when it come to this place.</text>

I really appreciated this in-n-out for its women’s restroom. There were 7-8 stalls plus a nice large space (not in a stall) that had a pull down changing table. I’m sure a lot of thought and consideration for women’s needs (# of stalls) went into this because my husband said the men’s restroom had 2 stalls + a urinal.<//review>

<review>Perfect pit-stop for road trips between NorCal and SoCal. Stop by for great (as always) In'n'Out. Parking is ample, service is perfect, and there's plenty of other things to grab nearby to if needed. 5/5 always.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>In N Out quality and management = Mcdonald's and Burger King!  We ordered a double double with animal style and a cheeseburger with onions.  They switched it.  Then when I mentioned it to the manager, Robert, he sent it to the prep lady with glasses and told her to just switch the buns. Bottom Line, the animal style was mixed with the non animal style. I told him it is not right, Robert said they are busy. Totally not the service expected of in n out! I guess you can just switch buns and make a crappy burger and call it good... I thought In N Out was about quality. I obviously was wrong.  Totally unacceptable!</review>< user_name>

Great customer service and the food is great (it's in-n-out duh it's good.) Also they have a ton of RV parking which is probably pretty helpful if you got one. 🍔💯<//text>

Literally in the middle of nowhere. I haven't had it in a while (like maybe 5 years. Still good but not great. Quite touristy even for being so far from all the major cities.< /Text>

Yum. Basics done right. You can always count on In-N-Out for yummy burgers, fries, shakes.
Helpful, friendly, efficient staff. Clean restaurant, good safety protocols. I appreciated how they limited the number of customers going inside, even if that meant waiting outside in the sun.<//Text>

This is a standard In-N-Out, but with a twist: it's conveniently located in the middle of nowhere next to the 5 freeway. As is expected, service is prompt and food is delicious. There's also plenty of parking to take a break from driving, eat in your car, and do some stretches. Just be warned: you're definitely not the only one hoping to grab In-N-Out for lunch. The line will be long.</Text>

<UserId.>115793307909476996266</UserId.><text>I could not go through drive through because I was pulling a 40 foot trailer. When I arrived there were no cars at all in the Drive-Thru I ordered inside along with two others. We waited a long time while the staff proceeded to prepare all the new drive-thru orders which arrived after us. There were at least six. Then, I believe there was a new trainee and the burger preparer was holding the burgers right up to his face so he could see how they were put together. They were wearing masks but I still don't like my food being held up 6 in to someone's face. I travel that route 5 times a week and always stop at this location at least three times a week. This however will be my last stop. Not that it matters this restaurant makes phenomenal money and has a great reputation.

The In-N-Out  is conveniently located across from the Tesla Superchargers.</text>

Always a dependable experience, not just the best burger you can buy. Famous for fast service, they also feature a lot of shaded outdoor seating. Everyone should know by now that items "off-menu" are available, like a burger wrapped in lettuce in place of the bun, triple and quadruplestacked burgers, et cetera. And if your neighbors are chatty, enjoy their company: I'll bet that they are YOUR kind of people 😉.</review>

Despite people being crazy over in and out I never shared that enthusiasm. The bun is always soggy and the fries are not crispy.< /Review><user>109778918191516868911</user><response>None</response>< Time>

I drive by this in-and-out 2 or 3 times a year. It is always packed with tour busses. They did a great job moving people through though.< /Review>

Honestly, I don't get it. People rave about this place. My third time and location. Every time the food is just mediocre. Clean and friendly environment, maybe that's the hook? Give it a shot see what you think.<//text>

The food and service were fine. But the amount of flys in the lobby was ridiculous.< /review>

< review>
I love the location in Kettleman City, right off I5.  the burger is consistantly good at all In-N-Out’s, the problem is the same; you are never in and out.  The drive through takes forever, and if you go in it seems the drive through takes precedence.  To be honest, there are many other choices at this location, and since I am always passing through here, I think I’ll go to another choice to save time.<//review>

I know everyone really loves IN N OUT, but with a limited menu and fries that are nowhere as good as Five Guys (or any other fast food joint), I can't give them a rating above 3 stars.

The restaurant is clean. The service is great. But the food is only okay, to me.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
First time trying this restaurant. It was off the highway so very busy. Even though the rush never ended, the staff was excellent in getting food out and served to the right customers. Tables were being busted as soon as people left, floors were exceptionally clean as well as the bathroom facilities. One of the best shakes I have had in a while. Wish more were located in the north.< /Review>

<review>This place is still as popular as ever amid the covid-19 crisis.  Employees made sure that social distancing was enforced, periodic cleaning of the dining surfaces, the fountain drinks are there but no longer self serve.  There was only one dispenser for hand sanitizer located at the entrance.  The bathrooms needed more attention with cleaning.</review>< GmapID>

I asked for a protein style and they only gave me one wrap of lettuce ☹️ I don't take the bum and I know it doesn't cost a lot for iceberg lettuce. Why not put at least 2 a o they are not coming apart so fast.< /Review>

<review>I love having a quick bite on the road from a place that is the same at any location you find one.  The more I visit the more I appreciate them. I order my burger with onions grilled and extra tomatoes and Dr. Pepper to drink. I never have to explain my order,  they get it!  Look for the palm trees:)< /review>< pictures>

To get to this location, you can enter on the North if you are headed East. If you miss it, then turn after the Chevron and go around to South to enter. My family, and a whole bunch of others, like In-N-Out, so I eat there when they choose. They are consistent, and they work hard.</Text>

<text>Holiday travellers flock to this In-N-Out in Kettleman City which is about midway between LA and San Francisco. Quality is consistent all throughout the burger chain. Service is extremely quick. Make sure and order from their "secret  menu".< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< username>

we were on vacation and hungry and we saw the restaurant. It was a nice clean restaurant and the people were Helpful. Most of the time when we are traveling if we see In and Out Burgers we try to stop and eat as by our experience the food is always good and consistent. The service is also Consistently good. Every In-N-Out Burger that I have been has been nice and clean had this experience was also good.</Text>

As awesome and consistent as any other In-N-Out stop I've made since I've been going. The secret to happiness is a double-double with fresh onions, grilled mustard, animal fries with a dab of sauce.... 😋</Review>

<text>It is 1:30 pm, the line is out the door, all types of humanity are present, why? To partake of the delicious hamburger that is made the way you like. For me, the double  double animal style, for the wife, hamburger, no onion, add pickles. Fries and a drink, 7 mins later, we are filling our stomachs. Just can't beat the In-N-Out experience.  Enjoy.</text>< pictures>

For a restaurant off of highway 5, fantastic.  Clean fast and good.  No line that in itself was amazing.  Back on the road in 25 minutes after eating a quick meal.  The way it was prepared it must get incredibly busy, so beware.< /text>

This was our first time eating at In-N-Out Burger. We ate here on 5/24/2018 on our way to San Francisco. This is just a stop off the highway and it shares a parking lot with McDonald's, which is kind of funny. This restaurant was packed when we were there, unlike McDonald's. The food was great, even though we had to wait a while to get it. I really appreciated the sauces!</text>

Their Double-Doubles are the BEST cheeseburgers you will ever find. Ask for grilled onions on top of the two parties of meat, and the two slices of cheese, and it just gets better. Clean inside, friendly staff, fresh food. With bathrooms and ample parking. What more could you ask for.
Even their milkshakes are great. Enjoy!</text>

<time>1577170289897< /time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>Busiest In-N-Out in California...Kettleman City location lies almost exactly between L.A. and S.F. and is always busy during lunch hours, any time of year. Often, we find tour busses there, which means 60 or more people from one vehicle. More often than not, there are lines outside the building. And yet, the organization, friendly staff, excellent work ethic and overall efficiency makes it do-able and still fairly fast. I have had my number be 30+ numbers behind who they are serving, and still get my food within 10 mins. Consistent quality, clean bathrooms. If you are traveling on I-5 and craving a burger and fries, this is the spot to visit.</Text>< Pics>

Nothing else to say but best fast food burgers you can get.  Fries are a matter of taste, but add some salt and all good.  Shakes are awesome.</text>

The food is typical In N Out, which means better than any other fast food you can find. Clean facilities with a good size do ning room and parking lot

Great place to stop on those long trips to/from northern to southern California.  Consistently have some decent prices on gasoline here as well so that definitely makes this exit preferable to others.< /Text>

Loved, loved, loved the food. I didn't think it could possibly live up to the hype, but the food was outstanding. Most fast-food burgers are overdone and tasteless. These were fresh and delicious. And the condiments table had hot chilies!!!<//text>

Great location, right off of 5. Stop by for some quick food then get back on the road. The only issue is this place sometimes does get very crowded, but it is an In-N-Out so the know how to move a line pretty well.< /Text>

This is one of those town's I would normally just pass up, but it was a good place for a pit-stop, or at least I thought it was. Finding this restaurant is quite difficult as it requires a bunch of side streets to access. And getting out can be challenging as is finding the freeway.  Food is great as usual, but the location isn't! The entire area is a bit of a tourist trap as gas prices are much higher here than other places.</text>

At the cheeseburger without onions, fries and a soda. The same old question where's the beef. Every trash can in the place was overflowing one of the dirtiest in and outside I've been at.  I wouldn't even say anything about that because they are always busy but this place was not busy at the time.< /Review>

Can't go wrong when you visit In-N-Out Burger.  The double stack burger with the secret sauce is very delicious.  The fries are freshly made on site.  Those taste good with the secret sauce.  Customer service is always the best.  They deliver the food in a timely manner with friendly customer focus service.  The Arnold Palmer drink is one of my favorite drinks.< /Text>

This spot is worth a visit. They serve large portions for reasonable rates. Consistently well organized and with good mood. Will visit here again.< /Text>

<text>At the cheeseburger without onions, fries and a soda. The same old question where's the beef. Every trash can in the place was overflowing one of the dirtiest in and outside I've been at.  I wouldn't even say anything about that because they are always busy but this place was not busy at the time.</text>< pictures>

Just regular burgers if you ask me. Their fries taste like cardboard. It's like they don't care how they taste. But clearly they are doing something right to have all those locations.</review>

Very clean restaurant with plenty of seating inside and outside. I ordered french fries which were delicious and a chocolate shake which I mostly threw away because it was too fluffy or full of air bubbles so to speak and did not have the texture of a milkshake at all. It was not very cold only cool, so I think maybe the temperature regulator on the shake machine was not turn to cold enough. I've had shakes it other In and Out Burgers and they were more like a real Shake thick and with ice crystals. There were a lot of people there today so maybe the machine was not given enough time to get the mixture cold enough. I ended up throwing the shake away from this In and Out Burger. My friend had a burger and she thought it was okay.<//Text>

In_N_Out is one of the best burger chains in California. They sell nothing but burgers frys and drinks. The hamburger patty's grade has changed since they 1st started. Clean and friendly service.  I went with a bus full of Housing Advocates and the ACLU.</Text>

<review>Driving past this restaurant, I decided to stop by for a snack.  I did not know that it would open at 10:30.  when I saw in the window that their employee was shaving while standing behind the counter.  I changed my mind about taking their burgers.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWO6cdRDjy3IJZD6LZhEm3MRZBMosCa4f0rNMD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><GmapID>0x864e9f98620c4dd9:0x6de05b09ecac81a</GmapID><Response>None< /Response><Date>1579280045175< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><UserId.>116511866831587696705< /UserId.><name>K P</name></record>

Clean restrooms, parking, and freshly prepared food. You really cannot ask for more from a burger joint. Entrance is a little hard to find, but makes since they have a corner location.</Text>

Not bad. My food was correctly assembled. Cold fries were quickly exchanged for fresh when I asked. Then, a manager came by and replaced the entire order again with an absolutely fresh one, even though we had already eaten half the burgers. She wanted to be sure we enjoyed all our food fresh and at the same time. Nice.</review>

It was my second visit to the park in Anaheim after a long period from 2008. I saw that the park had  many additions besides the new Galaxy's Edge. This park is not like the small one in Paris. Also Galaxy's Edge is beautiful but I really would prefer to see the missing attraction.< /text>

<Review>This is where I learned that I had a sunburn in my leg simply from driving.  This review is to raise awareness for the dangers of the sun. 🔥    anyways.  No it's not.  This was actually funny.   But the 4x4 animal style, and the animal fries were on point!  Great spot to grab some great grub!</Review>< name>

Good burger. I liked the double-double and the pickled chilies. Soft drinks free refill. Efficient kitchen, professional staff. The lady in the dining area keeping the tables clean at all times. She greet customers at the right moment and makes small talks. The lady makes eating burger at this establishment a very human experience.<//review>

<review>Very busy as another mentioned, but rushes we'll managed. Plenty of staff and most friendly and in order. Tasty meal, don't be intimidated by a double. Only big because of condiments. Much like steak n shake if familiar. Not bad in price for Cali, $7 and change for the meal.</review>< pictures>

Very nice associates. There was an issue and the cooks didn't get the tag for our order, and once the issue was noticed, they made the food and brought it out within something like five minutes. Order was exactly right and delicious! They handled the mistake very well, (even though my dad was not acting like the most patient person ever). Everything in the dining room and restroom was stocked and clean, too.</Text>

What else can I say. Its In-N-Out Burger. One of the best, if not, the best burger joint in California.  I know it's not the only place to get a burger, but the atmosphere and work ethics prove this place is your best choice. Easy Food menu to choose from and delicious fresh cut french fries. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

A young man named Jose served our food to us while sitting in the dining room. Great service all around. Burger was hot and tasted great. Would have been 5 stars if I had received a full portion of fries. Unfortunately it was only a half portion.< /review>

<Text>This place is across the street from a huge truck parking lot it's a super easy walk to get in and out of there... The food was made fresh and it was delicious! The french fries were perfect my milkshake was the right consistency and tasted great. I'm definitely going to go again.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I ate hear for the first time on my way to Texas! It was a fun experience. The line was through the door, but like the name , we were in and out! If I’m being completely honest, the burger was good, but not great. I was actually surprised how average it tasted, because I hear people ranting and raving about it all the time. We ordered our fries animal style, basically they add chili and secret sauce (1000 island), and that was also good but not great. The atmosphere was awesome, and I’d probably visit again. Kudos to the workers, they were working hard!</review>< pics>

<Text>If you're not originally from California, like me, you will arrive wondering why everyone here can't stop raving about In-n-Out.

Well, I'll tell you why:  It's good.  Really good.  But I'm not just talking about the food.  The place is well-staffed, extremely well-managed and *clean*.  And I'm not only talking about this location.  I'm talking about every one I've been to.  Every.  Single.  One.

For those of us who grew up on McDonald's in the 1970's, when it was a much better place than it eventually became, you owe it to yourself to brave the crowds and visit In-n-Out and see for yourself.

I'll never eat McDonald's again.< /Text>< pics>

<name>Frank Scovill</name>< Review>
There are very long spaces between stops on Interstate 5 between Bakersfield/The Grapevine toward the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley and Stockton in the northern portion of the valley. Here is a bright spot in the southern area, and the In-N-Out was outstanding.
Upholding the high standards we have come to expect from this franchise, you will not be dissemination. And in one of the highest traffic areas in California, the employees were fast, efficient and very pleasant toward everyone in every circumstance.<//Review>

In-N-Out is always good.
animal fries, protein style burgers, milkshakes,  and 4x4.
They always have friendly helpful staff which is always a plus at any restaurant<//Review>

<Review>This has been our go to stop midway between L.A. and San Jose for the last three years, but recently has gotten crowded (good for business) but bad for us. People don't know how to maneuver parking lots, the bathrooms are now disgusting, and the wait for food just takes too long. It used to be a "quick stop" (15 minutes) but not anymore.<//Review></record>

While driving down the I-5, we realized we were getting hungry as we approached Kettlemen City. Thankfully In n Out states open late so I ordered the first burger I've probably had in a year at 11 pm.

Delicious fries, iced tea, and the standard hamburger. Even though they were packed with a ton of new high school graduates celebrating on a Friday night, one employee offered to get our food when our number was called so that we wouldn't have to get up.

Super nice! Great food and awesome service; all night long!<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

In n out is always a good place to have hamburgers but this place is a little cheaper than ones in bay area because of tax maybe.
Located in the middle of San Jose and LA so I always drive in to fuel and have a meal.</text>

My son’s favorite place..for vegetarians you can order grilled cheese burger with extra vegetables at same cost..can add grilled onions too. They make their fries from scratch in their kitchen..it’s awesome..in the best fries among all fast food joints..very clean and hygiene friendly place..< /review>

In-N-Out is the best fast food place period. I always get a double double, an animal fry, and a pink lemonade. Some of the best service in a fast food place and the dining floor is always clean.<//text>

I frequent this restaurant in a regular basis when traveling. Employees are always very curtious while working in a fast paced environment. During the summer months this place is packed with the line to order going out the door. If you order burgers expect it to take 20 min or more to get your food. Which is not a complaint just FYI.< /text>

There are very long spaces between stops on Interstate 5 between Bakersfield/The Grapevine toward the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley and Stockton in the northern portion of the valley. Here is a bright spot in the southern area, and the In-N-Out was outstanding.
Upholding the high standards we have come to expect from this franchise, you will not be dissemination. And in one of the highest traffic areas in California, the employees were fast, efficient and very pleasant toward everyone in every circumstance.<//Text>

I always visit this location on my 5 Freeway trips. Great service (even opened 10 mins early for my group's chartered bus, THUMBS UP :D). Food is like every other In N Out, simply DELICIOUS. Very clean too, both indoor and outdoor seating are well-kept. AWESOME place overall for a quick pit stop! :)</Text>

My son’s favorite place..for vegetarians you can order grilled cheese burger with extra vegetables at same cost..can add grilled onions too. They make their fries from scratch in their kitchen..it’s awesome..in the best fries among all fast food joints..very clean and hygiene friendly place..</text>

One of my favorite hamburger restaurants in California. That being said, this spot is fast and efficient, and of course the food is always good. Feel bad for the young lady taking our order outside in the hot sun. Anyways, despite the huge line, the line moved fast and the food as always good quality.<//text>

Great value. The cashiers are always pleasant. It's not a good place to go to meet up with a friend--it's too noisy to hold much of a coversation.  I wish that In-N-out had electronic boards displaying the customer's order number rather than hearing someone constantly yelling the order numbers. It's still one of my favorite fast food restaurants.< /text>

Super busy while traveling, but generally clean or close to it. Lots of bathroom stalls, and a changing station in the women's bathroom (not sure if there's one in the men's). Good sized parking lot including about 6 RV parking spaces. There's at least 5 tables outside, can't speak to how shady they are during the day as I've only been there around 5-6pm in the summer, but they were in the shade of the building by then. A few well used grassy areas to let your dog do its business. I don't think I've ever had trouble with the food, although they might have forgotten the ketchup packs one time. Just be sure to ask!< /Text>

Same old reliable fresh tasty burger but it is crazy busy during the holidays or long weekends. During holidays you can expect 25 minutes to get your food served and another 15 minutes to get out of the parking lot. Oh, good luck finding a table too. Other than, same friendly staff and great burgers.</Text>

Super fast compared to all the other ones I've been to. All up and down California and even the one in Oregon, and this one was by far the fastest. We got number 78 and when we walked in they had called number 60, but still had our food within 5 minutes, and man was it delicious.<//Text>

The burgers itself are of a nice texture and quality. Do mind their beef supplier. If you have ever driven on N5 from LA to SF you should know what am talking about. Being a meat eater myself does concerns me and have no plans to come back.<//text>

Everyone is nice and helpful, their prices are good, and they are very clean. Can be busy at times, but that is probably because they are a by a highway and the only city for miles. They handle a crowd very well! Overall great service!<//Review>

I have never gone through on a mega bus (nor will I) because this site is always bustling.  We just stopped in at 10:40 am and had a short wait but a line formed quickly behind us.</review>< gmapID>

This was the friendliest in and out that I have ever been to. It's located in a funny place. You have to enter in in a back road, but the place was clean, friendly, and I was very impressed by the service the staff gave.</Text>

Pretty busy place, it's crazy.  This people work really hard. We bought to go because this places was super full but anyway the hamburgers are ok nothing special but the vanilla shake is really good! I love it. You have free parking and it's close to de Avenue.  Follow me in Instagram and Facebook @HoppinCities for more reviews and places<//Text>

I like the hamburger from here, especially cause I can ask for protein burger, they will wrap hamber in lettuce neatly for you instead of buna, to cut the carba. Not many burger places do that for you.</review>

Everyone is nice and helpful, their prices are good, and they are very clean. Can be busy at times, but that is probably because they are a by a highway and the only city for miles. They handle a crowd very well! Overall great service!< /Review>

We always stop here when traveling and they always have the best and freshest tasting burgers and fries.  I have never gone through on a mega bus (nor will I) because this site is always bustling.  We just stopped in at 10:40 am and had a short wait but a line formed quickly behind us.< /review>

The food is always good, especially after a long drive. Why then the three stars? One star lost because of the bathrooms, they're tiny and inadequate for the number of people who come here. To give you a hint of the badness, there's almost always a wait for the guy's restroom. The second star was lost because of the indoor seating, many folks wait around for others to finish and then jump into their still warm seats. Over all, this In-N-Out is undersized for its location and popularity, by a large magnitude.<//Review>

<Review>Had their double double burger. Loved it! The burger was very fresh. Also here’s a tip for something off-the-menu: ask for their “animal fries” - real potatoes made fries, topped with onions and melted cheese.< /Review>< Pictures>

In n Out is a great establishment, however this specific one is a huge tourist hotspot. There is always a line much longer than other In n Outs and that takes a toll on the staff and food quality. Even swinging in to use the bathroom real quick can be a mistake.</Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>The food was great, just like any In-N-Out, but this particular one had a poor bathroom. The toilet seats were too small for the toilet. There was a flipped over wet floor sign in the middle of the bathroom, and the floor wasn't even wet. The mirrors were all foggy and faded, and the food preparation wasn't too good either. I witnessed an employee be careless with my food, and another employee even asked her why she did that. I wouldn't advise this particular location for an In-N-Out. Next time I am in this area, I'll most likely be trying out a different place to eat. :(</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x864e9f98620c4dd9:0x6de05b09ecac81a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went there on the way back from Anaheim. Burgers and fries were delicious, as they had been on the way there. However, the drinks had a soapy taste, like chemicals. The town is known to have a toxic plant up the hill, blamed for birth defects in the town. When we asked about it, they first told us we were the first to complain. Later, however, the manager told us that they knew and that they were on the phone with someone about it, and said it was "not harmless as far as we know of". I love it there, but please be cautious with the drinks!!!<//text>

Just stopped here real fast on the way back from Pismo going home to Modesto. The line was crazy long and the delivered the food light speed actually. No wonder they have so many people working at one time! I can even imagine where these people commute from since there is nothing else out here, they must pay good!<//review>

If you are traveling from central California to the coast, i mean, you got to stop here. The lines are always wicked long, but always worth the wait. Their food is always consistent and tastes amazing.< /Text>

A go to place when traveling around the I-5. This is like a midway point between SF and LA, so it's a great rest stop when eating a meal. In-n-out is always great to get, especially with Animal style (grilled onions and extra sauce) and extra toasted buns.<//review>

Honestly, I don't get it. People rave about this place. My third time and location. Every time the food is just mediocre. Clean and friendly environment, maybe that's the hook? Give it a shot see what you think.</text>

Used to eat at a part of this chain everytime I went to NTC, I guess the workers are taught the same thing. It's not often you go to a fast food chain with respectful YOUNG people behind the counter.</Review>

Just like any in n out shin dig but much busier. If it's a nice day out, during lunch rush, good luck finding parking & place to sit. Regular burgers come with raw onions but if you ask for grilled, it'll be just grilled that you get. They have grilled cheese (secret menu) which comes with pickles & can come with grilled or raw onions, probably even both. I wonder if the cows we driveby on highway 5 are what's for lunch. Anyway, one guy working here was very nice, clearing tables outside. Would come here again but try & stay away from their most busy times.<//Review>

Went through drive through on Sunday 2/11/18.
There was virtually nobody in line which is rare for in n out.
We received our food with the quickness and it was on par with what you expect at this chain.

Perfection.< /Review>

This is one of the best In-N-Out locations anywhere, and a good bet for a place to take a break on I-5.  It is always packed, and at peak times the line is out the door, but they are ready for it.  During the last visit they averaged well over two orders served per minute, so even with a long line out the door we were eating less than 10 minutes after parking.  And in the midst of that rush the food was still at its best.  Double-double gooey and delicious, perfectly cooked, but not even the skightest mess while eating it -- that takes a skill level you don't find at a lot of other In-N-Out locations.  Fries were very crisp and somewhat bland, easily fixed with some salt and pepper, as it should be so that you can season them to your liking.  Dining room and restrooms were very clean and in order, extra help was available to keep it that way.  If every In-N-Out were like this one, I'd put them on par with The Habit and Shake Shack, at least for quality and service.< /Text>

I'm not  big of a fan but I'll give them a three, fries to crunchy and I don't love. The burger sauce but without the sauce I'd eat them, shakes are good also. The place clean and pretty quick and the o in smell will lure you over.< /Review>

We stop here probably 3x year on our drive up north but I feel like the crowd gets worse every time. The food is great but they have got to get a handle on their overcrowding on holiday weekends. Thankfully the cashiers are super friendly!<//Review>< pics>

It's an In-N-Out that gets a lot of traffic being in Kettleman City, and getting to it is a bit miserable.  Seemed to be short staffed my last stop (after 8pm on a Monday), but past stops haven't been bad (relative to the number of people).  Food still came out as expected.</review>

I come here about 4-5 times/year for the last 20 years. But the last time I was here, I bought protein sytle burgers and the lettuce was still soaking wet with water making the burgers taste terrible!!!! Quality is waaaaay down at this place.</review>

Grab your burgers here before heading west towards the coast. I always try to stop here when passing through, because it's never quite as busy as their other locations near the cities. Fries are fresh as expected, burgers always juicy. Bathrooms looked a bit neglected, but that happens sometimes.< /review>

As with all In N Outs, the service is fast and the food is tasty.  We time our drives between northern and southern CA to ensure we can make a pit stop here.  The other options along I-5 are sub par compared to In N Out.< /Review>

However, this location, being the last In-N-Out stop on the way to San Francisco on I-5 from LA, is usually quite packed with limited seats available. Therefore, unless you are doing drive through, I'd say stop ahead of time at another In-N-Out location.<//Text>< pictures>

I love the burgers, but I haven't gone there for about 8 months, ever since I found out that In-N-Out contributes to the Trump campaign, I will not being giving my money to a company that supports that Fool, just Google the company's or business that support him, you will be surprised!!!</Review>

Very popular and busy.  Great midway stop for a SoCal to/from NorCal road trip.  Fuel yourself up here, then fuel up your car before heading back on the road.  Check their secret menu in advance if you want some variety.  I recommend a Neapolitan shake and mustard fry cheeseburger, protein style.<//review>

As with all In N Outs, the service is fast and the food is tasty.  We time our drives between northern and southern CA to ensure we can make a pit stop here.  The other options along I-5 are sub par compared to In N Out.</text>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>I like In-N-Out. In fact, I love the chain and its burgers. However, this location, being the last In-N-Out stop on the way to San Francisco on I-5 from LA, is usually quite packed with limited seats available. Therefore, unless you are doing drive through, I'd say stop ahead of time at another In-N-Out location.<//review>< pics>

C'mon this is In-N-Out, it's good anytime. Great place to stop inf you are on I-5 and are halfway between SoCal and the Bay Area. If you have a dog they also have great outdoor seating. Can be crowded at times as everyone seem to stop here for gas and the pit-stop that families need to do.<//Text>

Compared to most In-n-Outs this one's drive thru is much easier to access. It's also very long for when it's busy. Parking is extensive. Staff is very friendly as you'd expect at an in n out. 5 Stars when compared to other In-n-Outs.< /Review>

A very hot summer day--- staff very busy the store was full ........ yet all was working so well that for me was great
All the staff should be commended for the attention to duty, respect, and personal grooming all was perfect.
Management did not have to intervine at all while l was at the restaurant . In the contrary
they were also waiting on customers. ..
Will return to this store... and live in Wildomar  California.< /review>

This location was okay, but had an issue with multiple files in the place.  Not just 1 or 2, but more like 5 to 10.  Additionally the staff was not that great.  Someone spilled a drink in front of the couch ter, and instead of cleaning it up for them, they simply handed them napkins...< /text>

Where we are from we don't have one of these so when we are on vacation we most definitely go here!!😋 Gosh I hope they'll come to their senses and build one in Bend Oregon!🤪 Although there's a lot of competition here already but this is why we have options 😉< /Review>

Had severely undercooked fries the last time I was here on a Megabus stop. Soggy and floppy flies are unacceptable, but I had no time to go back to complain since the service was so slow that the Megabus nearly left without me. Took about 20 minutes from when I ordered to when I received my food. Try the McDonald's next door if you're just stopping for Megabus.<//review>

This location of in n out is always busy, but they're consistently quick and friendly, and their quality never slips. This is a travel route store, so it would be easy for them to just be rude and pushy because they know they'll get more customers if they lose some. Despite this, they remain kind and eager to please. This is one of our favorite places to stop on the way to the coast.<//review>

There seemed to be a lot of flies inside the restaurant, however the food was good.  Take the time to go to the mining town that is right next to it.<//Text>

Same old burgers, but this location never has enough seating (even outside) and the line always wraps outside.</text>

In-N-Out is always consistent in their quality. This location of the I-5 is no exception! The parking lot is medium sized and the drive thru line is well organized.  Service as usual is very snappy and courteous.  If you're in the area or going on a road trip,  In-N-Out is always a safe bet for food!</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Delicious as always, but this time I ordered something new for my Animals Frys cheese fries (yellow cheese melted in the oven) with the special dressing of the house, I almost did not like them because that cheese I do not like I thought they used Cheese for nachos. But if you like American cheese you will love animals frys.

(Original)
Delicioso como siempre, pero esta vez ordene algo nuevo para mi Animals Frys papas fritas con queso (cuadrito de queso amarillo derretido en horno) con el aderezo especial de la casa, a mi casi no me gustaron porque ese queso no me gusta pense que utilizaban queso para nachos. Pero si te gusta el queso americano amaras las animals frys.</review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Delicious as always, but this time I ordered something new for my Animals Frys cheese fries (yellow cheese melted in the oven) with the special dressing of the house, I almost did not like them because that cheese I do not like I thought they used Cheese for nachos. But if you like American cheese you will love animals frys.

(Original)
Delicioso como siempre, pero esta vez ordene algo nuevo para mi Animals Frys papas fritas con queso (cuadrito de queso amarillo derretido en horno) con el aderezo especial de la casa, a mi casi no me gustaron porque ese queso no me gusta pense que utilizaban queso para nachos. Pero si te gusta el queso americano amaras las animals frys.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Burger was delicious, but unfortunately the fries are nothing. That's why a star deduction. But judging only the burger, it would be 5 stars.

Burger war super lecker, jedoch sind die Pommes leider nichts. Deswegen ein Stern abzug. Aber wenn man nur den Burger beurteilt, dann wären es 5 Sterne.<//Text>
