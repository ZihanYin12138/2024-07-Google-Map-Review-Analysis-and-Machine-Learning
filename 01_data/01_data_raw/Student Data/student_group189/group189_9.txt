<rate>5<//rate><Review>I've been coming here for over 17 years, I'm 26 now. The food quality has only improved, unlike some other places I know. You can't go wrong with any of the food choices they offer. The people and service are amazing, they remember your name, and when I was a teenager I forgot a $20 bill and they ran after me to return it. How honest is that! For all these reasons, I will continue to be a loyal customer here.</Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Only have ever gotten a vegetarian breakfast burrito here.  It’s always been amazing and affordable.  Going on 10 years of me receiving the same excellent to-go experience.  Limited, casual seating<//Review>

All the food was great. The shop is very cute and looks like family owned. Orange juice was nice and fresh. Breakfast burritos are really tasty, they are medium size but also pretty cheap!< /text>

<text>Great little place for quick Mexican food. We came on a Sunday for breakfast and we both had the carne asada breakfast burrito.  It was tasty and the homemade salsa was delicious. I have to say it was smaller than I expected, but the price was right, so it was appropriate.  We can't wait to come again for the lunch!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJHWtvNxMTQDAZSI78eOKjQ3JHGwp733HJ9xYd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9-L-aDZCEJMfwh9GLc1eTPmAGuVG7J76FEney=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Delicious and affordable! Breakfast burrito and fresh squeezed orange juice is incredible. Or wet burrito for lunch. It's family owned and has a cute outdoor seating area. It is technically cash only but they have an atm right next to the register! You really gotta come here if you're in the area.</Text>

<Text>Ignore every review that says anything negative about Delia’s. This restaurant is THE final word in Burritos.  If you want food that is going to enhance your life from the first to the last bite and have you coming back for more, Delia’s is the place to go. There’s a reason why so many people love it. It is the only restaurant in the world that I have purposefully driven over an hour and a half from my house just to get a breakfast burrito... and it was 110% worth it.</Text>< Pics>

The coffee was phenomenal, but that's the namesake so I would hope so. However, the food wasn't anything to necessarily write home about. Prefer to go to bea Beas down the street, same wait with an even better menu.< /Review>

I don't even know what to say.  Had a to go order, food was just awful. Ordered the chicken breast sandwich and "steak" sandwich which is just a slab of some breakfast steak in a roll covered in mayo. Actually had high hopes for this place.< /Text>

Food was great! Got the chorizo con huevo, berry pancakes, egg and spinach sandwich, iced cafe de ollas (MUST ORDER, even for non-coffee drinkers). They did forget the side of fruit for the sandwich (which costs extra) but mistakes happen.</Review>

<user_id>104245578941153418830< /user_id><Review>I spotted this small little Quaint restaurant driving in this neighborhood that I'm not familiar with and decided to go ahead and give it a try, and what an amazing surprise. It has such a charm about it it's a small quaint place and the cooking is so home grown, we really enjoyed the food we ordered and will definitely return again. Parking might be a challenge but there's three parking around the neighborhood so go ahead park on the side street and walk on over and enjoy some authentic homemade meals.

Nice date sandwich was delicious the combination plate was even better and my friend had the flautas play with she raved about.</Review>< gmap_id>

Truly Exceptional. I don't often write reviews as, to be honest, most places are between one and three stars with food so bad, uninspired or bland and I don't want to feel like I contributed to the demise of a small business, which leads me to normally remain silent. Delia's has possibly the best tacos Dorados  (fried hard shell) I have ever eaten and that salsa roja is almost unmatched with a perfect balance between spice, salt and lime. The refried beans are the perfect consistency and you can tell that they were homemade and finished off with a nice dusting of cotija cheese. I'll absolutely be back and can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Truly impressive!<//Review>

Saw the reviews for Chilaquiles and they were not wrong.  Amazing!!!  I try them everywhere we go and these were the best so far.  My husband had the chorizo plate and said the same.  Also you have to try the orange juice!  Thanks guys for great service and food!!!<//Review>

<text>Amazing food, Great prices, friendly staff!! Everything I has was so delicious. I had French toast with bacon eggs and sausage. My husband had chilaqiles with beans, eggs, and a side of fries. We both left extremly satisfied! Definitely coming back! There orange juice, freshly made and the best I've had so far. If you have room for dessert I recommend the flan. It melts in your mouth.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Decided to give this place a try since I used to pass by it numerous times. Plus I was in a mood for Mexican food. It is conveniently located on York Blvd right next to the fire station. Not very hard to miss, especially if your driving. They do have parking an is super small, but street parking seems to not be an issue.  I love that they have a decorative outside seating area with plants and the shade from the trees nearby. So if you have a furry friend you're good to go. Decided to order sopes de carnitas, only order two since I thought they were going to be small. To my surprise they were not, not only that but also the meat was really tasty. I complimented the owner about the food and she was grateful and seem humble about it. I fell in love even more with the place. They stop service early so give them a call before you come so you get no surprises. I will continue to give this place my business since the service was great and food was up to part.< /Review>

I love this spot for breakfast! Super friendly, reasonable prices and delicious food. It's everything I ever wanted in a neighborhood eatery. Specifically love the breakfast burritos, but everything I've tried has been great!<//text>

When anyone from out of town comes to LA and is looking for a good breakfast place I always recommend Delia's and to get a breakfast burrito with avocado. The service here is amazing and the people here are always serving with a smile. Great place highly recommended!!< /Review>

I have been going to this restaurant when it was under different owners. When it was called York Burger. Since they have taken over it has felt more like home! They treat you good, and with respect.< /Text>

Good menudo. Good pancakes according to my wife. I had machaca (shredded beef) with eggs and they were good too, and I was glad they were able to serve them without chile. We’ll be back again (this was our second time for breakfast).<//Text>

The staff at Vogue Studios are great.  I've been going there for several years to get my  haircuts. Andrea cuts my hair and she's fantastic. She cuts my hair just the way I like it. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed.<//Review>

I recommend this salon over any salon I've went including Ulta the one in the mall the one diclemente this tops all of them. I just got a perm and for once i am satisfied for what I'm paying. It's affordable ,and everyone is nice. Take my word for this . This is top notch and I will be back and I will tell others how good this place was . Thank You!</text>

Showed a picture of the hair color and design I wanted however I got something completely different. It took a lot of time, I spent 4 hours and 30 minutes and my hair wasn't ready in time so I left with wet hair and realized as it dried it wasn't what I wanted.< /text>

I'm glad I found this place,  very close to where I live. Came in for a color and haircut, very pleased and happy.  I had a hairbox color very difficult to remove but the hairdresser gave me a few options and I'm glad with the results. Next appt I 'll bring my sis to do her hair.<//review>

You're better off going to Supercuts. This place doesn't care about clients or customer service. I would not recommend spending your money here.< /text>

<Text>I was looking for a new place to get my hair done, but the very first thing I saw was-“Please do not bring your children unless they have an appointment.” That does not work for me as a stay at home mom of two. Sounds so snobby, I’m glad I looked at their website before going in there because I won’t support a business like that.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c25942d3d63b4f:0xbaa197702c5ce0c9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Yesterday I went for a color correction and balayage service. After 8 hours and 430 i walked out with an undesired hair color. Please make sure they perform a strand test on your hair before starting a long coloring  process. I wasted a lot of time and money for an undesired end result.
2 stars because i like the way Priscilla cut my hair.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Came here for shave ice with the family and it was awesome. From other pictures, it looks like they used to have the petal-plastic containers I remember from Hawaii, but they’ve replaced them with more eco-friendly paper-based bowls. The ice shaving machine looks like the standard Hawaiian one and the ice itself comes out light and fluffy. About 16 flavors are available, limit 3 per serving. $4 for a small, $6 for a large and $3 for the unadvertised mini. Add $1 for a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle. Small is a generous size, pictured below.

Update (4/11/2021): Still delicious and the best shave ice I’ve had outside of Hawaii. Mini is now advertised, small and large increased in price a little bit. Absolutely worth it. Inside dining is closed, so it’s either eat outside sitting on the brick walkway or take it somewhere else.<//text>

offers a great alternative to ice cream or frozen yogurt. Very affordable with a bright and clean atmosphere. I highly recommend giving Big Al's a visit!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Very happy we found this place.    Not only do they offer Hawaiian style shaved ice, but the new owner is very nice and considerate.   Prices are good too, but I must write about the shaved ice.   Once you've had shaved ice in Hawaii nothing on the mainland really stacks up.   That changed when we found big Al's.   Their ice making machine and tools are bought from Hawaii and it is just as light and airy.   Don't miss this place if you're headed to Avila Beach, CA.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

An awesome find. Daughter wanted frozen yogurt but we saw a sign for shave ice and decided to head to Big Al's instead. Got two shave ices with ice cream and halpia cream along with an iced vanilla latte. The shave ice reminded us of Hawaii. The vanilla latte was on point. Had a chance to talk with the owners. Very nice and you can tell they really care about their products. Locals and visitors are lucky to have a place like this right near the beach.</review>

Went to Big Al's today just for the shave ice. It really does live up to the other reviews I've seen. Truly authentic Hawaiian shave ice (make sure you ask to add ice cream). Lots of flavor options. Great friendly service. I highly recommend it. SHAVE ICE.<//Text>

Walked around Avila for a bit and ran into this hidden place. One of the best cafes I've been to.. And you would never know that you were in a crowded place since it is secluded and just a hair away from the beach. Great spot and great prices, love the vibe.<//text>

First time at this place, I absolutely loved it! Had a delicious and humongous shaved ice 🍧 with ice cream in the middle.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I will definitely keep going back for more! 😃</Text>

This is the best shaved ice I have ever had. They also have an option to add a scoop of ice cream. Definitely recommend coming here.<//Review>

Small little coffee shop with a great atmosphere and great service and prices. Chatted with the owner Tim, who took our order and made our coffee, you can tell that he enjoys what he does and he was very pleasant. The coffee is all brewed locally and is all organic and tasted great. Will definitely go back whenever I'm at Avila Beach< /Review>

<text>(((( ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ))))

I am so very grateful and extremely satisfied with South Bay Storage in Harbor City!
Not only are their prices exceptionally fair and reasonable, the grounds are very well kept up and managed by some of the best customer service that I've experienced this past year now!
All of the staff at South Bay Storage have quality values from the very first day upon moving in to an appropriate unit that they helped me decide upon. Very very CLEAN and SANITARY and SECURE and WELL MAINTAINED facility!
Since March 12th 2019 when the Nation rapidly implemented a "stay at home order", the "wearing of masks", " washing our hands" and of course the "6 foot rule" , South Bay Storage in Harbor City was not only in quick compliance in all areas of meeting those governed standards to prevent the spread of Covid-19 Corona Virus,  but I believe they were by far TOP NOTCH before even entering the facility at their secured gate, we were notified. Not only do I sleep well at night knowing that my property is secure, I feel safe while on their property with an immediate sense of good SANITARY and CLEAN EVERYTHING! And that's NO JOKE! This has got to be #1 on the MAP FOLKS!
I could go on and on with very satisfied rave reviews of what I've experienced as a tenant and customer!
Especially in this challenging time in our nation and around the globe, again, in my honest opinion, the management team hear would be, could be and are very capable, skilled, dedicated and ready to be a, no wait, This team is more than likly---->"THEE", #1 prime example of how a storage facility should be managed!!! Bar None!!!
FIVE ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐ STAR RATING IN MY BOOK!!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

KEEP UP THE OUTSTANDING JOB!!!

Sincerely,

Ronald W.
San Pedro, Ca.
VERY SATISFIED TENANT!!!< /text>< Pictures>

The customer service I received was second to none . I was really impressed with the fact that they had carts to put your possessions on to assist with unloading your vehicle. I’ve patronized quite a few storage facilities and South Bay is by far the best.< /text>

< review>
I moved in June of 2018 and had to down size from a 4200sq ft house to 1900sq ft house so I had to store half of my belongings. I looked around for the right storage facility a month before I moved and I chose South Bay Storage because of how secure the facility is and the cleanliness of the grounds. The prices for the different size spaces are very reasonable...better than I expected!

Varun is fantastic in every way! He was very helpful and patient with me while considered what storage space would work for me. Needless to say...he did not have a drive up space available at the time but promised that as soon as one becomes available he would call! Sure enough, one of the lovely and very friendly sales agents called about three months later and I was able to move to a much bigger space.

The facility is exceptionally clean, well kept and well maintained. Tony, the maintenance supervisor, is always on hand to assist you if needed. He’s great too! There are no rodents and that is a plus!

If you are looking for storage in this area...this is the place for you!</review>

<Review>DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING!
I reserved a 10 x  11 unit through sparefoot and when I went today to complete rental contract I was met with a big surprise.  Rental rate is not $112.50 per month.   I was told rental rate is $225 per month and that the $112.5 is only for first 3 months (half off).

The manager was not available today and will not be in the office until Tuesday, 6/30.

I didn't receive any written communication from the storage facility to indicate that the rental rate was not as advertised on sparefoot nor was I informed of this in any subsequent reminder email messages.   One of the customer service personnel on site claims she told me in phone conversation that regular rental rate is $225, but I have no recollection of that.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1600297385819, 'text': "Hello Theresa, as we already talked about this and explained that sparefoot.com clearly shows the unit at $225/month and it was discounted to $112.50/ month for the special as you stated. Sparefoot has all the details listed right below the special when you book the unit. Its a 3rd party service and then the email you the booking they don't show the details but its all listed on the site when you book. We tried giving you a good rate but you did not want that either. I was waiting for you to change this rating as we had done our best to accommodate you. Sorry for the misunderstanding over the advertising but i hope you will give us another chance in the future."}</resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
The ladies in the office are outstanding when it comes to the customer service they seem to always remember mine & other customers by first name and storage unit  number. Even if I'm just walking in to pay a bill or calling over the phone. These ladies are very experienced and versed at what they do. They all have been at this location for many years. I've never been treated unfairly. They even don't mind that I really access all of the amenities and services that they offer like photo copying and  the  use of the computer in the business  office room.  They are even reasonable when I keep communication with them about an expected delay of payment.
All four of these employees are outstanding individuals with Great Customer service.
OH and the OWNER is also just half as Nice.  But hopefully if he reads this wonderful review, he would contemplate giving these great ladies a RAISE or even a NICE BONUS !!!

Thanks again to all the employees at SOUTH BAY STORAGE CENTER you guys are doing a great job.
KEEP IT UP!!! (I'm out! "drop the mic")<//Review>

From the moment we first walked in the door 8 years ago in 2010 to inquire about renting a storage unit until we finally moved our stuff out a month ago, this company and its staff were superb.  They truly believe in friendly service first and service with a smile.

And let me tell you about the storage spaces themselves:  They are completely enclosed.  No open ceilings or rafters or flimsy walls between units (as I have seen in other locations) and that means that your belongings do not get dusty or dirty.  In 8 years, I never saw any evidence of rodents or bugs, not even a spider web, let alone a spider.  Not only are the offices immaculate, but each of the buildings is spotless, the bathrooms are spotless, and the grounds are well-kept and manicured.  My unit never showed any signs of tampering and I never saw anything that made me question security.

If we ever need a storage unit again in the South Bay, I would not hesitate to return to South Bay Storage Center.  There simply is no way their service and facilities could be any better.  They are simply the best.<//Text><Name>Debi Luther<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I had to have my things in storage for an extended period and honestly these people are great.  Really you can't go wrong with this facility.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I recently posted a review that reflected badly upon this facility. I  apologize for that.  I did not know all of the details at the time of move out. I used this storage location for about a year and the staff were wonderful and the pricing was great. Upon the move out day I was not there. I relied on movers to take care of it. The movers complained to me about their "happenings" during the move out involving the Security man on duty, however after I received a call from the Manager about this. It was made clear to me that the story that I was given by the movers was not completely true. Therefore in my opinion South Bay Storage is a great facility and I highly recommend them.

The other options I've looked at in the area are nice, but South Bay Storage Center went above and beyond to show excellent customer service from the moment I got there. I'm a mom of two children under five, who were with me when I went to look at units. When we got out of the car an employee immediately offered to open the front door for us. We walked inside to multiple happy and friendly faces who welcomed us (this felt like a big deal since the other storage companies seemed to only have one employee at a time--it felt safer knowing there are multiple people watching over everything at all times + security guards around the property). My kids were wiggly as I was asking questions in the front office and the two women helping me, Yasmin and Grey, offered them paper, colored pencils, and light up keychains to entertain them. Grey even hand-sharped the colored pencils that had gone dull!! Yasmin took us up to see the unit and was so accommodating off my questions and figuring out the best plan for the rental.

The property and buildings themselves were super clean, and I loved that the buildings had windows to let in the natural light instead of having to walk down a closed off hall to get to my unit. All-in-all I'm excited to be doing business with South Bay Storage Center!<//review>< rate>

So far one of the best storage centers I’ve dealt with  this place has everything, the customer service, the cleanliness, and the great prices. When you get great service though the price is not a problem, the staff there were very professional and very helpful they got me the quotes I requested and I was able to get the unit I needed. Definitely recommend this place to anyone around the area.<//Review>

< Review>
Stored some business items at this facility for a few months and was very pleased. The items that i stored required for them to be stored in a dry cool place and they were able to accommodate that by placing me in a climate controlled building with a/c. Access is easy and wide which was great for me because i needed to access my unit frequently. The staff has been working there for years which makes them very knowledgeable and professional.< /Review>

<Date>1514652836557< /Date><Text>Our family are longtime tenants with South Bay Storage Center. We have rented several units from 2012 to present. Security is our number one priority when considering a facility’s worthiness. South Bay excels in this regard with a balance of simple but effective security protocols and thorough maintenance. The property is attractive with plenty of natural light and all of our “C” building units are climate controlled, which is a rarely offered premium service that makes working in the unit a much more comfortable experience. Office staff are exceptional in their customer care and groundskeeping is equally remarkable.
We have had different kinds of problems with every other storage facility we employed, especially during stretches when our family lived out of state. But we have never had a single problem with any aspect of the process/experience of storing with South Bay. As local homeowners, we consider ourselves very fortunate to have S.B. Storage Center  so conveniently located.  Thank you, South Bay Storage — you have our highest recommendation.<//Text><user_id>102369573910102015398</user_id>< response>

They are committed until they hear back from you. I called Friday and they were great about setting aside a unit for me @ NO deposit. I would show up Sunday. I moved around and lost my phone. They tried getting a hold of me. Finally they, did 2weeks later and i was surprised they still had the unit for me. I apologize and figured since i didn't show up. It would be given away. In return i posted a 5Star review.  Tnx guys</review>

Food quality on Wednesday was quite poor.  Outside atmodphere is nice, but doesn't make up for inferior food or chef.  Used to come here often before it closed and remodeled.  Restaurant seems to have gone through 3 cycles over the last 6+ years, each worse.  Now menu is very small with relatively little selection.  Vegetable add-ons are poorly cooked and flavored.  Seafood and burgers are over-cooked.  Even blueberry bread pudding of first restaurant iteration was pretty ordinary.  Won't be back.</text>

<Review>Tapas y Vino closed about 6 months ago, it is now 1892 Bistro (the founding year of Redondo Beach), Andy is still one the owners. The motif has changed a lot, the menu has some additions and deletions. Definitely worth trying again.<//Review>< GmapID>

Food can vary from excellent to ok. Love some of the tapas. Others not as much. The sangria is very good. Also love the scallop and sausage dishes. Check the menu and if it sounds good to you, you will likely be happy. Wish the wine program had better Spanish selections at actual spanish wine prices.<//Text>

The food was excellent and our server (Jerome) was very attentive and helpful.  I had the duck breast with couscous and my girlfriend had the Black Cod.   The mushroom/manchego cheese appetizer was ok...seemed like the preparation was a little rushed.   They also have a great wine selection....but no bottles under $32.  The bottle we had Evodia (2009) was $38 but sells in the stores for $7.   I guess i just can't get over the high 500% mark up in restaurants.  It just seems a little a little extreme.

The ambiance was ok.  You can tell they're trying.   But the decor is a little conflicting.  It's a mix between modern and traditional.  The outdoor patio area is great....and they have heat lamps to keep it cozy and warm.  There's also a nice modern-style fire pit.     It's the inside that needs a little face lift to keep up with the modern/contemporary feel i believe they're trying to achieve.    Also, the television behind the bar is a bit distracting.  It's constantly on even when there is no game.

I gave it a 3 because the ambiance clash.   One of the main reasons I enjoy a restaurant is because of the ambiance.< /Text>

Don't let the fact that they offer appetizers fool you. You will need a wheel chair you'll get so stuffed. Quality and atmosphere make this spot a hit for a bite with fiends. Great wine too!<//Text>

The food was pretty good, but a bit expensive for the food you get, even for a tapas place, where I don't expect the food to be cheap. I'd totally go again if someone else was paying for it.< /Review>

<text>It's a good gym. Clean and the equipment you need. However, it seems like unless you go before 8 a.m it ends up being packed to the point you cant use any equipment because everything is taken. For instance the squat racks,  I don't think I have been there since when the 2 racks were actually available.</text>< GmapID>

<Text>This is one of the best Gold's locations you can go to. It's clean, the people are nice, and there's a spacious "grass" area for powerlifting, floor exercises, and more. There is a sufficient amount of equipment however the 3 bench presses are always taken at peak hours.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Fairly priced, clean, decent hours and everyone very friendly. + For having far less teenagers than most of the 24s I've experienced. Definitely in another league when compared to the Altadena 24 hr for those wondering. I live very close to the Altadena 24 but drive here.< /Review>

<text>As far as the equipment goes, it's a decent gym. I love the hardcore vibe the gym has, but the members are terrible. Between machines CONSTANTLY being broken or members absolutely refusing to re-rack their weights, getting a decent workout in this gym can be difficult at times. There are a handful of people who actually clean up after themselves but having to unrack a fully loaded leg press because some guy decided to ego lift is frustrating. On top of that, the dumbbells outside are an absolute mess, between mismatching weights or dumbbells going missing entirely. The gym itself is great aside from a few machines I wish it had (nothing that would make or break the gym) but the members and how they treat the gym are very upsetting.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2dca78c11b061:0xcc9e54b7f3736092<//GmapID><rating>2<//rating><username>Sweeney</username><date>1558990147467< /date><user>113332380879043756194</user></record>

I should have read the reviews.... it looks like they have a company competition of which location can keep the most credit card numbers from their customers. I talked to the managers and her staff, no one would help me out. I payed for twice weekly personal training, but after only one session my trainer recommended three days per week and said "you'll see faster results" and of course I agreed. One week later, he again suggested I increase training to go to four times per week with the fifth day free. So, of course I increased again thinking this would be the best deal possible. I am new to weight lifting and personal training, so the five days a week became too much for me physically. I asked to downgrade back to my original two days a week. Guess what, they won't let you downgrade and they continued charging me for $950. What makes it worse is they didn't tell me they'd continue charging me the same, even though I had the reduced schedule. I had to discover this by reviewing my credit card statement at the end of last month! They told me they won't refund any of the money, that's it's impossible to return it and they have a contract. They showed me the month to month contract I thought I had signed, but they sneaked in a two month contract to extend it one additional month. They blatantly tricked me! Talking again with the managers and employees, they just kept saying they can't do anything, that we have a contract. So reluctantly I'm finishing out my personal training sessions (that I already paid for) as they won't refund my money. The entire experience was ridiculous - unprofessional and abusive of this business.</review>

<Text>As a gym facility, this is a great spot. Not usually too busy, plenty of machines, free weights, and even an outdoor section if you want to take advantage of the weather. I generally find the members to be friendly and courteous. The staff are usually bright, cherry, and helpful. I have been in and out of town for the past few years, and they were able to waive my "initiation fee" a couple times since that is a ridiculous fee (~$60). So overall a great place to workout- I would recommend it, especially over the large, overcrowded places like LA or 24hr fitness.< /Text><user_id>105363355566469738364< /user_id><rate>4</rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><username>Justin Hillman< /username>< Gmap_id>

{'time': 1496181776328, 'text': 'Hi L, We apologize for this experience at our gym. We do charge $15 for a day pass, but the front desk associates should always be asking if a member wants a receipt, which we will gladly provide. The liability waiver should be filled out on the first visit, and on any future visits there is an option on the form for "returning guest." There is the option to change visitor\'s guests to monthly billing, which would be $32.99/month if they frequently visit the gym with you. If you\'re interested in this option, or have any other questions, please reach out to the General Manager, Janet Gibbs, at janet.gibbs@goldsgym.com or (626)304-1133. Thank you.'}<//resp>
<text>This location has some suspect, underhanded business practices. I have been a member for about 4 years and within the past 2 weeks, I have taken my friend who is not a member twice on separate occasions and was charged $15 each day for a day pass. What struck me was that my friend had to fill out the same form (liability waiver) in person that is online for a free trial, and no receipt was offered/provided on either occasion which raises the question of whether staff is pocketing the money or they are told not to provide a receipt by management. The other concern I have is that I get charged bi-weekly and have asked to be charged monthly  (easier to track with the rest of my finances) to which they said they were unable to do and gave no reason. That is no way to treat a loyal customer. I plan to bring both of these issues to the Better Business Bureau.< /text><userid>117249107916952861037</userid>< username>

Horrible customer service. They do not greet you when entering  they are rude when asking questions. I do not recommend the kids clubs the girls are always on their phone not watching the children or they are chitchatting with members. Any concerns you'd had they would not assist I've been going here for over 2yrs it's not crowded and equipment is clean but customer service ruined it for me I'm done, so glad I won't be renewing at this location.</Text>

<Text>I came in on business with Musclepharm and I was greeted by friendly and attractive staff. I had never been to a golds gym before but had heard good things about them being the go to for heavier dumbells and a bodybuilding friendly environment.

There was a decent mix of ages but I would put the average age there to be late 30's. From my conversations there I would say the crowd was rather well informed about nutrition and supplements.

The gym is definitely older, but I found the equipmemt to be in working order with great mix of classic and newer equipment. There was more equipment in then gym than expected. Floor space there is utilized very efficiently.

Highlights would include:
1. 150lb+ dumbells
2. Adjustable Deadlifting platform
3. Bumper plates and a rubber platform for Olympic lifts
4. Outdoor patio with weights and furniture.
5. Separate room for cardio equipment and a dance studio.
6. Its one of the three corporate Gold's gyms in Cali. So an "All club" membership from them($50ish/month) would also give u access to the Venice and Long Beach gyms. All other Golds gyms in Cali are franchises and cant offer access to the Venice club(the mecca of bb'ing).</Text>< Pics>

As soon as I walked into the office, Eric was very welcoming. He answered all my questions thoroughly and was very helpful. It was also very convenient of him to be able to translate everything in Spanish for my grandmother. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for affordable prices for car insurance.<//text>

<Review>I lost my jacket at this place while dancing and the team wasn’t cooperative to help me find it. I don’t think anyone should go to this place if the employees at this place don’t care to help you find you belonging from camera footage while you enjoy. Why pay so much money as cover charge when they take no responsibility.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAMsyxbU5yTV7kuOr_rjIPwU-BZoPhFXYLXWDi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f7e3c0db18abb:0x208cb384e40dda0c</gmap_id></record>

<text>Bruno's is a neat venue to check out while wandering through the Mission. A step or two up from your local dive bars, Bruno's offers a wide variety of alcohol to fulfill every person's needs. I recommend booking the private back room for a large party/special event/birthday and you can certainly have all the fun you want while entertaining guests.

Drinks are pretty much standard SF prices of about $10 each. Dress up a bit and put your fancy shoes on so that you'll feel part of the In-crowd.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Title last time I'll be going here because they had it advertised on Eventbrite that is free before 11 and I screenshot the event just to make sure we don't run into problems. when we got there the door person try to tell us that it's 15 to get in and when we showed them the screenshot of the Eventbrite stating that it was free before 11 they still would not Connor the tickets or us getting in.<//Text>

<text>Its an okay place to go with a group of friends. The mix drinks are not the best here at Bruno's. Better of getting beer. Small but good enough to fit a good amount of people. They have two dance floors.< /text><name>ivan yanez<//name>< response>

<text>If you're looking for a good time in the Mission, you might want to check out Bruno's.  This inconspicuous bar houses not one, but three dance floors. The music is generally pretty decent and the crowd is usually a mix of people from all over SF.  If you get there before 10pm, you can sneak in without having to pay the cover.<//text>< resp>

We went for a party late at night. The bouncer checked our bags (I always like that because of security). The music was pretty good and we had an awesome time!

Also, the beer was quite cheap and the drinks were good and served in a timely manner.< /Review>

<review>Ah, I long for the old Bruno's: Where you could hear great live local jazz for a reasonable cover. This incarnation of Bruno's is all about the bridge and peninsula crowd, and DJ spun tunes. That's fine, if it floats your boat, but it sinks mine like a stone.</review><gmap_id>0x808f7e3c0db18abb:0x208cb384e40dda0c</gmap_id><date>1369279370967< /date><UserId.>104358571929442807869< /UserId.>< name>

Multipurpose Bar/Club that often hosts themed nights.  Cover is charged to enter, and adjacent hiphop bar is often times very full of young, dancing individuals that have had a little too much to drink.  More relaxed atmosphere is located next door with a 15+ foot bar.  Great spot to begin your night and in close proximity to visit many different similar spots close by.<//Text>

< Review>
I've been here multiple times for birthdays, girl night outs and going away parties. There are two areas in this club. The bar area where people can dance usually has hip hop and r&b music. This area also has booths for bottle service. And the actual dancefloor is usually top 40 or EDM music with all of the lights. My friends and I always have a good time here and there is something for everyone! The women's bathroom is cramped and small with two stalls but that's always the case in clubs.< /Review>

Came here Friday night with my girlfriend. It was already midnight when we got there so it was just at that cusp between boring empty and uncomfortably full which was great. Seemed like there was no dress code even though it's advertised and a 5 dollar cover. It's not big inside but there's plenty of space to dance. In the middle is like a table that runs the length of the bar to put drinks on. The drinks where decently cheap and very strong which I loved. Whom ever they had DJing last night was killing it though , the crowd was going crazy with every song he mixed it , it was great. At some point in the night we left and I left my card and Id. When I went back to get it the doors where closed but I knocked and got the owner who was super nice , asked me to come in , got my name and returned my ID and credit card. Would come back!<//Text>

<Review>Came here on a Saturday night with some friends and had a blast. I loved the music, it was top 40 I would say but with both new songs and old school songs. The fresh prince theme song came on... how could you possibly not do the carlton to that. I didn't like that the only tequila they had was patron but its ok.

Cover was 5$.

Dance floor was pretty packed but there was plenty of space. The DJ did a great job switching up the songs. The bar area was fairly large and open.

Overall i'd definitely come back especially cause its in the middle of everything.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We went to a party there and the place is just adorable! Love the atmosphere and vibe of the place. Barely had cell coverage though, text could get out but not calls. Not their fault, just saying.</Text>

Let me start with....We traveled from Colorado to get married here at Sweet Pea Ranch. Husband and I both are originally from Cali, and so our friends and family could all be with us on wedding day we loaded up the toyhauler and came to cali. They offer all inclusive packages which made it very easy for us being states away. They made us feel like family, our wedding was above and beyond what we imagined. We will forever keep this day in our dreams. We come from a ranch town and have horses of our own so Sweet Pea Ranch was just for us, we felt at home.
We would like to celebrate an anniversary here down the road (if they allow that)</Review>

Working with Sweet Pea Ranch for our October 12th wedding was an absolute dream. I was incredibly nervous going into the wedding planning process. The idea of having to coordinate everything was just overwhelming and I was sure where to begin. I stumbled upon Sweet Pea on The Knot's planning app and instantly fell in love with the photos of the venue. Then learning that it was all inclusive, I knew that that was the way for us to go. We had a long engagment but knowing that everything was set and waiting for us to be ready for our big day, was such a stress relief. The fact that all we /had/ to do was get ourselves dressed, get someone to take photos, and someone to marry us (which now is a package option at Sweet Pea as well!) made the few decisions we did have to make so much easier! Our day was beautiful and went off without a hitch, though it did seem that the DJ didn't play many of our requested songs which was a bit of a bummer (but the music he did play was fun!) but I'm so grateful that I found Sweet Pea Ranch! We could never have planned the beautiful day that they gave us!< /Text>

Their wedding was the fairytale wedding my daughter has always dreamed of. From the first time we went to the ranch an met Tess, Jen and Chelsea my daughter knew it was a perfect place for their wedding. I just can’t say enough about Tess, Jen and the entire staff. Jen was our coordinator and she did not miss one detail. Jen and Tess went above and beyond to accommodate a few extra requests we have made.   Not only is the ranch an amazing place for a wedding, the animals added the perfect extra touch. I will recommend this venue to everyone.      I am one happy mama.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1584486775042, 'text': 'Thank you so much Teri! What a privilege of was to host this special day! Thanks for the shout out of my team!

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>Just recently went to a wedding here and it was okay. The ceremony spot was small and cute. The layout of the venue is a bit odd and I didn't care for the uneven terrain every few steps. I saw a few people trip which didn't seem very safe. The reception area was very rustic and well themed but they only had port-a-potty's which was such a turn off for a wedding. So gross to use in our wedding attire. I wouldn't come here again or book them based on that alone. One of the staff members said this place has been here for several years so you would think they would make indoor bathrooms a priority but I guess not. Food was okay but no vegetarian entree option and nothing was super tasty. Near the end of the night, the bartender cut off my friend who was drinking and she was not even drunk. She was so embarrassed because of that and they went to so far to tell the Bride that she was cutoff. I would have been livid had I been the Bride. You don't interrupt my night to tattle on a friend. She hadn't been aggressive nor rude to anyone when they cut her off and yet they still seemed to make a scene about it. It really turned me off to this venue. I felt really bad for my friend since she had actually gone up a couple times for me and the Groom's mother for drinks as a good gesture. Overall, this venue left a sour taste in my mouth for recommending them to anyone.</text><gmapID>0x80c33a76d9f0abc7:0x4e14f3406f824b8<//gmapID><user>112248665434125003993</user><response>{'time': 1584488758378, 'text': "Hi Mandy, we are sorry your experience was not what you expected. I'm not sure which of our Bride and Grooms wedding you attended however, I can tell you how much effort they put into making their selections for their guest to enjoy. Deep Pit Bbq with brisket, bbq chicken, scalloped potatoes, mac and cheese, grilled vegetables and  two type of friendly vegan and vegetarian salads, A four hour hosted bar service (free to the guest) fully loaded dessert bar, coffee bar, beverage bar, smores and popcorn by the fire pits are just a few of the amenities. Please don't forget the Dancing and music by their chosen DJ! He is the best! I know that our couple would have wanted you to have the best time ever! They carefully chose each guest in order to keep them in their budget. On average, couples pay over $100.00/per person for each guest they invite. The portajohns you mentioned are actually solar powered airplane type restroom with flushing toilets and sinks to wash hands. We have recently purchased a beautiful 8 station restroom trailer with hard wood floors, stereo and a fireplace. I'm sure the bride and groom are sad that you did not have a good time and that you were were disappointed with their Venue selection. As for the Bar cutting off people who have over consumed, we have a responsibility and obligation to abide by liquor catering guidelines. Our brides and grooms are in full support of that prior to the event. They want their guest to be safe. Please know that we wish the best for you. Tess Mercer"}< /response>< rate>

We recently had our wedding here and it was absolutely amazing. The staff from beginning to end was so accommodating and really went above and beyond. I have to give a special shout out to Chelsea. She was our point person through out the whole process and she really was such a delight to work with. We enjoyed her services so much that we even had her as our photographer. This place is magical and beautiful.  All of our guests couldn’t stop talking about this unique venue. The ranch is so interactive and that’s the kind of wedding we wanted. Thank you to Tess the owner and her staff. You made our wedding so memorable. We will be back to celebrate our 10 year :)< /Review>

<text>Absolutely gorgeous venue. Country chic. Attended and April wedding here. Perfectly situated, felt like it was far away from everything but was an easy drive and not too difficult to get to. A hidden gem tucked against the hills. Tons of beautiful photo spots. There was a concern for rain and tents were put up, they still looked beautiful.

All of the attendants and waiters were great.

One of the smoothest run weddings I've ever been to.<//text>< pictures>

Also they are open to a lot of different uses there.  I saw a production company use the entire place as their base camp for a shoot up on the mountain. So cool.  Really fun,  and the pictures you take during the events come out really cool because they have props all over. I know their pricing is competitive and you would most likely need to plan pretty far in advance for popular days.</Review>< Pics>

Haven't been there in a while. I was looking for some items for myself & a client and thought I'd check them out. Although i looked thru the selection they had and the store was very clean, some items were definitely overpriced.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Ok the worst experience in a beauty supply store in CA.  My daughter and I went into Maxx to get some hair products due to our recent move here to maintain our natural hair. Short story....my hooded hair dryer broke  moving here and I required a new one. Went into the store  was immediately  greeted by a male and 2 females. Not paying any attention i proceeded to shop but my 10 year old noticed the man and woman were standing on the ends of the aisle watching us...she has never experienced  this before but I have. I told her to overlook it. we aren't stealing.. its  done becasue some beauty supply stores experience a lot of theft in the beauty industry..

mind you I have read reviews about this place dating back to 2012. . not very good but being that it's the only place close enough without me having to drive to Oakland I took a chance to be a patron.

I got what I need and went to pay for the dryer and other items we picked out. I asked the lady checking me out if there was anything wrong with the dryer could I bring it back and she said yes if there was an issue with it. I asked her if  it was  the only one you have  in store. She replied yes. I am currently 37 weeks pregnant so I dont have time to be back and forth with COVID-19  added.. I get home start and finish my hair but when I am about to dry it the hair dryer is broken already!!! Yes broken.  Luckily I was smart and took a video and pictures of my husband taking the dryer out the box.

I go immediately to the store the next morning and was greeted and i addressed my concerns.  She tells me she will give me a 65 dollar credit. I politely said no ma'am.. she said its our store policy  or I can wait until they ship it off and return it or I can ship it off with the warranty myself... I said red flag. Its not my fault I received a product that was broken when I was told if any defects I could bring it back. No way I would have known about it being broken unless it was opened in the store. She proceeded to blame me for it being broken but had nooooo idea that I had the video of my husband removing it with pictures until I showed her. She was very defensive  before i could make my arguments.

She then proceeded to change her tune when I spoke of the bad reviews of their customer service and how they treat the community that try to support them and   How this was a manufacturing  or shipping defect and I am now being punished for something outside my control... it would be different if it was weave or products but its a dryer.... I am not going to spend 65 dollars in credit when I am  a locked queen and rarely shop in The beauty supply unless needed.

she made a phone call, told them I had a video and I received my money...

I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE.. I will take my coins elsewhere...</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>This is my go to hair place. I live in Vacaville but I will make the journey for the hair because there's so many different styles to choose from and great prices. They used to follow me around the store but if you've been there you'll understand why. On their front door there are so many pictures of people who have stolen hair or hair products. It's nothing personal. They are just protecting their business. However, they don't follow me anymore because I'm a regular and they trust me. They are sweet people and are always very helpful. I highly recommend this place.< /text>< Pics>

I feel bad for the people who claim to have been profiled at this place.  They've never followed me around, they're fast and they're always super friendly to my kids. Some stuff Is a little pricey but it's worth saving a trip to Vallejo or Oakland.</review>

Could be me being paranoid but "pretending to fix things" every aisle we're on is stupid. If I were going to steal I wouldn't come in with my pregnant wife and holding my daughter</Review>

I think they would get a greater base if they allowed try ons. Otherwise they have an array of other products such as shampoo, gels, hair care, as well as costume Jewelry and makeup.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>I love places like this.  It seems like restaurants like this are getting harder and harder to find.  Great ambience.  Excellent food, with lots of choices.  I had rib eye steak, garlic shrimp and ribs.   The food was tasty and the service was excellent.  The young man that waited on us looked a little bit and sounded exactly like Mathew McConaughey.   Great personality and you could tell he really enjoyed his job.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsUkBwe-mFCX5UMGOj6zpZzPJU3YZjyfHnsYt6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqiPGWNTqOhu4StqFbyaSx1D7myshljijXAlTO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCh666UEwOSTOGdo_wHE36mkvT71eURtw0-RD8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Not sure if u get silverware last around here but I we did not pleased. Also water was abundant but refills (tea, Shirley temples) were a hard nut to crack. Lucky food was on par with prices except lobster tail. Little high. Great time definitely would come again.<//text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>The average steak dinner is $50 and that's a 9oz filet & a slice of garlic bread.

Sides are not part of your meal.  Those are priced individually, which adds considerably to the cost.  One of our dinner guests actually said, after looking the menu over, "Oh.  Salad, beans and potatoes are $12 more, which should have been included anyway."  We laughed about it - but he was right.

Onion rings are provided for the table while you wait for your food and choice of ice cream or liqueur after dinner.  (If asked, we still would have preferred the sides to be included with the meal instead of these offerings).

There was a musician playing in the bar.  The music was audible to those of us in the dining room.  He was exceptionally good and we enjoyed it.  The atmosphere was casual and relaxed.

There is a view of the ocean but their windows were noticeably dirty and in need of a good cleaning.  Overall, everyone had a good time.< /review>< Pictures>

Cannot thank Jay and his staff enough.  Him, manager Ashley, and the rest of them helped make our wedding day special.  Helped us feed 30 family members who came to the coast to help celebrate our day.  The banquet room was the perfect setup and the kids had room to go out back and play.  The food was great as always but the staff and the kindness was the best of the best.  Cannot thank them enough.</Text>

Great food and great service! Be prepared to open your wallet but it's worth it! 🙂 We've been coming here for nearly 50 years and they have never let us down. (Except they closed their store with all the childhood candy, souvenirs, and the McLintocks salsa and sauces... *THAT* is the only negative thing I can't say about this place!)< /Review>

<Text>Limited dining here because of just opening 25% to the public because of pandemic. Waiters were overwhelmed. Two waiters made eye contact walked by. Third waiter from across the room came over and took our drink order 20 minutes waiting. While taking our drink order we decided to order our meal. Ordered the porterhouse well done this took over 30 minutes. The waiter explained with that thick cut of meat there's also extra time involved. When we finally got the porterhouse it was well worth the wait. However waiting for catch up salt and pepper that were not on the table may have taken 15 minutes. Overall this experience was a success despite the wait.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

My wife and I celebrated our 21st anniversary at McLintocks. The food is always good.  Our server was Savanna and what a great person she is. She was always there to check on us and when she learned it was our anniversary she made a big deal about it. She even sent over Ashley the GM to speak with us, another great person. Outstanding time, even better people, thank you ladies.</Text>

We went right after they reopened after COVID. Staff was super friendly and we didn't have to wait at all for our reserved table. Food quality was great. I got the surf and turf and my wife got the filet. Both were cooked and tasted really well.

Indoors was still a little weird to eat inside, but the tables were placed far enough apart and plexiglass was between the booths. Highly recommended, even during times where COVID is still present.< /text>

< Review>
This is a heartbreaker to write, because if I was doing this review 2 years ago, I'd be at 5 stars.

My wife and I were at F. McLintock's in early April and we definitely noticed the downhill slide that has taken place since the pandemic.  Everything seems to have been monetized here in the same way that steakhouses in SF and LA nickel-dime you for everything- it's all a-la-carte now.

Also, gone are the baked potatoes.  Seriously, how do you have a steakhouse and not have baked potatoes?  What's with that?

It breaks my heart to write this, but bang for the buck? You're better off going somewhere else.< /Review>

<Review>The food was amazing and the drinks were good. Service at the bar was really slow. Me and my wife had to  keep flagging  down the bartender to ask for another drink and flag him down again to cash out and had to ask for my dessert too😫 after cashing out. not the best experience I had there..</Review>< user_name>

Server Leo was very attentive and friendly which is exactly what anyone wanting to dine-in is looking for. Would eat here again and recommend to others. Keep it up F.

<Review>This was the largest portion of calamari I've ever been served, and it was delish! The lemon caper sauce does need help though, they process the capers, which takes away the whole caper sauce texture, no biggie just my opinion. The atmosphere was very upbeat, and all servers were very nice!< /Review>< Pictures>

Food was over cooked. I asked for medium rare and got well done on my steak. The lady behind me ordered rare and hers was well done. Waitress was very nice. Was not happy with my food at all.</Review>

We had our wedding dinner there and so it will be forever a part of our lives. Our wedding party was small but we were treated great. The servers were both nice entertaining, the food was great. The guests are from out of town and loved everything. The best part for the wife was as we were leaving, the whole restaurant gave us a rousing round of applause.</Text>

Went for our Anniversary dinner (other options were closed due to COVID). Our reservation was for 7. We got there at 6:30 and we're immediately seated at a table behind other people. Our order was taken, drinks were brought out. My husband's Mason jar had lipstick on it, and our server was no where to be found, we mentioned it to the bus boy, he took it away and brought a fresh drinking a. Then as I take a sip of water I noticed my glass was chipped. We sent it away with the waiter who came to say that  there had been an accident in the kitchen and he apologized for the food delay.3 other tables (large parties) received their food before us although 2 of those tables were seated after us. We wanted to walk out but we decided to wait the 20 more minutes for our food.< /review>

My SO and I were here for dinner tonight and had two slightly different experiences. I ordered the Strawberry Lemon-Tini. It was okay. Not great. He had an 805. They serve onion rings complimentary when you are seated, which is nice and they’re pretty good. My SO had an 805, and then we were ready to order. I ordered the surf and turf, with my filet cooked rare and he got the The Bleu filet. When my order came it was perfect and delicious I loved everything about it, however, his was cooked a little bit more rare than he would’ve liked it and he ordered it medium rare. Unfortunately, it looked exactly like mine, so I get it. I had another drink, the Shell Beach Breeze and it was fantastic we did send his steak back to be cooked a little more and when it came back it was perfect. We had the Tan Ferraris for dessert and they were tasty. He wasn’t super happy about the experience just because of the price...he thought it would’ve been a little bit better however on my end I thought everything was great.. my food was great, the service is great, and the drinks weren’t bad at all. I would definitely come back which means he’s also coming back ☺️.</Text>

We have been coming here for over 30 years.  I must say the place doesn't have the same fun atmosphere as before but what place does.  McLintocks is still a meal we look forward to each time we travel to the Central Coast.   The unlimited onion rings and salsa to start are still the best.  The steaks, which they are supposed to be known for, are average at best.  The sides make up for this.  We had the beef ribs and salmon this time and both were acceptable.<//review>

<Review>Took the family in for Thanksgiving dinner instead of subjecting myself to all the cooking and cleaning year after year. Thanksgiving menu had many great choices although my Father-in-law lamented that there was no dark meat turkey on offer so had ham instead. They could have done better with the green beans and yams but the rest of the food was delicious. Place was packed and very noisy. Our servers were excellent. Make reservations well in advance!<//Review><user_id>114125102937537621804<//user_id></record>

We had our wedding dinner there and so it will be forever a part of our lives. Our wedding party was small but we were treated great. The servers were both nice entertaining, the food was great. The guests are from out of town and loved everything. The best part for the wife was as we were leaving, the whole restaurant gave us a rousing round of applause.< /review>

Went for our Anniversary dinner (other options were closed due to COVID). Our reservation was for 7. We got there at 6:30 and we're immediately seated at a table behind other people. Our order was taken, drinks were brought out. My husband's Mason jar had lipstick on it, and our server was no where to be found, we mentioned it to the bus boy, he took it away and brought a fresh drinking a. Then as I take a sip of water I noticed my glass was chipped. We sent it away with the waiter who came to say that  there had been an accident in the kitchen and he apologized for the food delay.3 other tables (large parties) received their food before us although 2 of those tables were seated after us. We wanted to walk out but we decided to wait the 20 more minutes for our food.< /review>

McLintocks is still a meal we look forward to each time we travel to the Central Coast.   The unlimited onion rings and salsa to start are still the best.  The steaks, which they are supposed to be known for, are average at best.  The sides make up for this.  We had the beef ribs and salmon this time and both were acceptable.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Went there tonight (9-10-19). I was looking so forward to lobster. Hadn't had it in a long time. I ordered the lobster and added the petite filet cooked medium.  Well, the lobster was tough as nails. Could barely cut into it. It was $55.00 for a very small piece of inedible food. My steak that was ordered medium, was rare. I don't know what happened to this restaurant.  I assume it's poor management and the reason Steamers went out of business.  Such a shame. The sides were still good and our waitress was very nice. I think they should invest in premium chefs.< /text><user_name>Cindy Fire<//user_name>< Pics>

They have very good steak. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it for the quality of food. The service is great and they will poor water on your head if you ask. They also set the tables in a unique fashion.
Because of all of this I would highly recommend this restaurant.<//review>

They bought the onion rings back.  This is a great place for fun.  Have a waitress fill a glass of water on your head while wearing a blindfold.  You won't get as wet as you think.  Food is great and price is reasonable.<//text>

The staff here was absolutely wonderful. However the food needs improvement. The artichoke appetizer was great, but everything else had really no flavor p...my top sirloin. It was so overcooked,it was like shoe leather and I could barely cut it,l alone chew it.</text>

We eat here everytime we come to the coast. No reservation is necessary but it can be very busy and may have quite the wait. However, it's worth it!! The service is great with very friendly and quick servers and always attentive.  The bar is great with delicious mixed drinks and a wide range of beer. The main attraction is the food and is all delicious and there is a ton of it all!! Your guaranteed to leave stuffed with leftovers to take as well!!  From pasta, chicken to steak, is all fabulous and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!!</Text>

Mcclintock's is still mcclintock's. At least they're consistent. The pulled pork and chicken sandwich was good. I was just appointed they didn't have beef ribs.< /review>

The ribeye steak could have been better. Cooked medium rare to order, but not much flavor. Not very tender either.</Text>

No frills seating and pricey for the area, but very flavourful. I had the filet mignon with a blue cheese topping on a bed of mashed potatoes and it was very good.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu_YbDEzJ5UiCJeunRB0FZeLPNSleTTjddyEvp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

The atmosphere was fantastic, if you like the old west,  the service was good, the food was also quite good, a dish or two may have been a bit salty, but I would say that is personal taste issue. I WOULD GO!< /Text>

This place is amazing. The food is unbelievable  and if you walk away hungry than it is your fault. Very friendly staff and they make an entertaining spectacle of pouring your water. The food is cooked just right. They give you onions rings with salsa (yum)for a snack when your food is cooking and they bring the food it comes with beans, bread, dessert. I wish I lived closer so I could come frequently. There were really animals for decoration and all kinds of brands throughout the restaurant.< /review>

<Text>Service was absolutely horrible, The waitress was polite but super slow and seemed confused.  Took forever for her to take our order, forever to get the food and then she never really checked on us at all. We had  steak and a salmon. Got a rib eye really grisly and had no sear on it. The salmon was flavorless and extremely greasy from all the butter.  Really disappointed for a $100+ meal. Dont even get me started on the ambiance, awful & creepy....<//Text>< pictures>

This has to be one of the most disappointing experiences I have ever had!  I have worked in the food service industry in many capacities for 20 years and i have to say that I couldn’t be more disappointed!  My man and I went to celebrate my birthday. We ordered drinks and our meal.  Our salad came out before our drinks and then the fries we ordered with our meal came out and still no drinks.   Then my wine was delivered to the table and my boyfriends drink still was not delivered.   Our meal came out which was the ribeye and it was rare as rare gets.  And my mashed potatoes were cold.  We asked for a manager to come to the table because our server found it quite amusing that everything about our experience there was unexceptionable at best.  The manager shows up to the table and really is unimpressive. He says they will recook our steak and sorry it is not right.  When our steak comes back our it is well done. Our server finds this amusing we ask for the manager again.  Our server leaves the table and laughs with other coworkers about our situation and when the manager comes over again he is nothing but offensive.  Bottom line is we should have been more than understanding about the food but the disregard for service and the lack of wanting to truly make it right is unacceptable!  Had the server and the manager apologized and was truly willing to make it right we would have been happy.  But they were not and we left upset.  Unfortunately you have to give one star to post a review. I would have given negative stars if that was an option</Review>

Love Pismo location, Paso Robles has good food. But the environment is usually so loud that you can't talk without yelling. When I go to dinner with my family I want to be able to talk to them without having to scream. But the food is outstanding.</Text>

<time>1580792712563</time><rating>1< /rating><Text>Terrible experience. Start with cold onion rings then microwaved ribs old garlic bread and shrimp that smelled. Then didn’t acknowledge my wife’s birthday.  $125 dollars for a meal worse than cold McDonald’s! Will never go back here again. Do not believe the hype or be sold on the view. Over rated over priced and not recommended. Manager and waitress were pretty much like that’s as good as it gets sorry. Will comp you the $ 15 over priced mini champagne. Never apologized or tried to make the experience better. Highly disappointed with this so called fine dinning restaurant. What a memorable 40th birthday dinner for all the wrong reasons. Best part of the $50 meal was the scoop of ice cream . Kinda hard to get that wrong! Very disappointed McClintocks!!</Text>< pics>

Well! Right from the start my wife asked for a table and the hostess  said let me see what i can do and walked away. When she came back took our name and said she would call us so we waited for about 35 minutes before we were called, after another 30 minutes we get our order taken then another 50 minutes to get our food and to top it off my steak was cold. The manager did come by before the food was served to apologize and never came back to see if everything was ok. The waitress did upgrade our Desert to a piece of cheesecake but that took a while. All said and done it took us a little  over 2 and 1/2 hours. It had been about 8 years since we had been here and now i know why...............................< /review>

Once “The Place To Go”. Now just worn out and tired. Energetic and attentive service - casually presented. This place has a wonderful, sweeping view of the ocean  -  over Hwy 101. Too bad the double pane windows are fogged and streaked. Two to three star pricing with entrees that lost my enthusiasm pretty quickly.< /Text>

Terrible food. Terrible service. I brought my husband here under the assumption that it was as good as I remembered from 4 years ago... IT IS NOT.
We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 cocktails and 2 dinner entrees and literally every single thing was bland and disgusting. I've had better tasting food from a hospital. Our bartender/server disappeared for about 20 minutes and came back to notice we hadn't touched our food...like at all! (2 bites is all it took to know)  He made a joke about us not eating and kinda blew us off. We were just over it at this point. When he returned again, he offered to replace it but 6 items in and nothing tasted close to good so I just politely asked for the check.
The "manager" who avoided all eye contact with us even though he stood at the bar joking forever with staff, and never came by to check on us was "nice" enough to take $20 off of our $130 bill. If the service wasn't so terrible, the cold and bland food may have been a little easier to deal with. Save your money and go to a decent steakhouse.... Hitching Post or Jockos would be 100x better and worth the money.<//Review>

Simply the best and most entertaining place to eat on the central california coast. The meals are big portions, the atmostphere is fun and exciting.  But the food is Amazing!  All for a reasonable price also.  I think we paid about 25 buck a person when it was all said and done.  We were all beyond full and happy!  A must see when you go to pismo beach or the central coast.  :)<//review>

Took 2 hours to get our food and eat, all the steaks were under cooked and extremely rare. For the price save yourself the time and go somewhere actually nice on the water. Its tacky and not at all what we expected<//Review>

Very slow business on this particular night.  Our server was very attentive and sociable.  Pricey menu with a decent selection... food was fair as it was cold when served.  Not my 1st. choice to visit again.</Text>

The best place to eat on the Central Coast! This has been our family's go to place for more years that I  care to admit (70's)! Great food great drinks! The mushrooms are fabulous,   I always get the bacon wrapped blue cheese fillet mignon! They have steak,  seafood,  vegetarian options! Can't go wrong choosing this place!!!<//Text>

For those that read the price and judge, let me say you missed out. All the onion rings you can eat, they were great, I even tried the salsa and it had it's appeal. My wife a vegan even was satisfied with this place. Came here for my birthday this year,  it was all I wanted. Thank you all that served and made our time here great.< /Text>

Service was excellent,  wait staff were efficient and water glasses never ran out. The 14 oz rib eye was sliced too thin resulting in an overcooked steak. The promise of a discount for the steak did not happen. The night I visited, bottles of wine were 1/2 priced which was nice.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80ec587d3dea6819:0xc455945d4c42463a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Highes and lows. Been going there many decades first time back in five years. The steak was solid but the beans and potatoes are not what I remember.I appreciated the stroll down memory lane, but it kind of explained why it is not as crowded as it used to be.

Also they need to clean the windows. Beautiful view, sorry Windows tainted the experience< /Text>

Delicious food. The service was okay. I ordered the Garden salad with Tri tip on the side and the salad was not bad but wasn't great. Everything else was amazing to include the grilled BBQ chicken and the artichoke appetizer.<//Review>

Such a fun place for birthdays, anniversaries, office parties, whatever. Great food and lots of it. I highly recommend reservations and/or get there when it first opens, otherwise the wait may be long, but still worth it. Ask them to do their water trick, so much fun.< /Review>

This is my 3rd time having dinner at your place and was very impressed with our waiter who went all out for us from onion rings to keeping my Pepsi filled. Our meal was perfect and the after dinner drink a toasted almond was so good I had to ask her if I could get a big boy size
Which she gave me a big smile and said she'd be right back.  I wished we lived closer I'd visit at least twice a week. See you on our next trip down here from Washington.  Jayne thank you again for a great evening. Keep smiling. RD< /review>

Well let's just say there hours posted are not what they are.
Came over to a Cal Poly Mustang's game today and was really.looking forward to having a nice dinner at Mclintocks. Arrived at 9:16 and the doors were locked. So I called them while at the door and no one answered and all the waiters and waitresses were acting like they didn't see us.  Finally got someone's attention and they got the manager. He came to the door and asked if we were here for dinner, Duh.
We said yes and then he says sorry folks but were on holiday hours, in Oct.
We said that table right there was still looking at a menu and hadn't order yet and your still turning us a way? Again sorry folks were closed.
Well let's just say this is the last time I will be visiting McClintocks.

<Text>Wait time on a Saturday evening in the main restaurant was 45 minutes to an hour, we happily accepted seating in the bar. The staff was friendly, just a bit too busy that night. We ate our dinner but ran out of drinks, no one came by to refill. Additional side of food and beer that we ordered never made it to our table. Food was great, and ambiance with live music was great.</Text>< Pictures>

Recently moving back to the Central Coast I wanted to take my fiance to Mcklintochs for his Birthday. The food was good except for the fact that his steak came out way ahead of my food and was very rare when he ordered medium rare. The waitress only came by to check way into the meal. At the end she was in such a hurry to turn over her table that she mentioned the desserts really fast that we didnt catch all she was saying.  I felt bad for him because his questions were met with attitude from the time he was ordering his steak to a simple question about the birthday cake something she mumbled really fast. We ended up not getting dessert and she just brought the bill even thought I had mentioned it was his Birthday.</Review>

<review>I was there on Christmas as well as the prior reviewer. Had a totally "bomb" meal. Can't believe she gave such a wonderful review, but only gave 4 stars....  ???? What's up with that? I have been going to your place for 15 years on my annual Big Sur drive and have been eating there every one of those years to enjoy a great piece of meat! If this app had 20 stars, I'd give it to you. Great service, location and the best steak on the west coast! Keep it up guys, see you next winter!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Very noisy place.  It took 28 minutes to get my drink order.  Service way below average.  Hope food tastes OK.  Spoiled experience.  Had not been on central coast for many years and wanted to enjoy the evening.  Will not be back.< /Text>

<name>Debra Klosinski<//name><Response>None<//Response><Review>The food was delicious.  I had the baby back ribs. They were so accomadating to let me have both sauces  on the side. There was no way to pick my favorite. The BBQ sauce was very good also the sweet n sour just as flavorful. No, couldn't choose. Want both next time for sure. The staff are friendly and very efficient. The Lemon Drop martini yummy. Yes I will go back...where else can you start your meal with a basket of onion rings.

I've been going here for years, but when I went yesterday, it just wasn't right.

The biggest problem was the water. It tasted like mildew or mold. I thought it just might be the glass, but my wife's water tasted the same. This is a place where you want to drink the water because the waiters do pouring tricks (pour blindfolded so the the glass on your head, or just pour really high). My steak sauce also had a hint of this flavor (so I assume they used water in making it).

My steak was good, but it was overcooked. I ordered medium-rare but it was more in the medium to medium-well category.

The service here was first rate as always, but the water killed it. I'm surprised I don't see any other reviews talking about this.</Text>

OMG, so good! We've come here several times over the last decade or so. Food and service are top notch and the ocean view is so pretty. The prices have gone way up, we spent $110.00 for two people to have dinner, 1 drink each and 1shared appetizer.< /Review>

Very noisy place.  It took 28 minutes to get my drink order.  Service way below average.  Hope food tastes OK.  Spoiled experience.  Had not been on central coast for many years and wanted to enjoy the evening.  Will not be back.< /text>

<text>Recently moving back to the Central Coast I wanted to take my fiance to Mcklintochs for his Birthday. The food was good except for the fact that his steak came out way ahead of my food and was very rare when he ordered medium rare. The waitress only came by to check way into the meal. At the end she was in such a hurry to turn over her table that she mentioned the desserts really fast that we didnt catch all she was saying.  I felt bad for him because his questions were met with attitude from the time he was ordering his steak to a simple question about the birthday cake something she mumbled really fast. We ended up not getting dessert and she just brought the bill even thought I had mentioned it was his Birthday.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80ec587d3dea6819:0xc455945d4c42463a<//gmapID></record>

We ate at F. McLintocks and heard that their steaks are excellent. We ordered our dinner and an appetizer and after 15 minutes the waitress came over and said "apparently I forgot to hit 'send' for your order"! "Oops"! We finally got our appetizer and then our dinner and I was extremely disappointed at the top sirloin steak. It had no taste and was bland. The next day I noticed that I left my credit card there from the night before and returned to the restaurant to see if they had it. The manager was not very friendly and made no effort to see if he could find it. He said, "it isn't in the lost credit card section so I guess it isn't here"! I said I might have dropped it on the floor but he made absolutely no effort to help me. It was early in the day and there were very few people there so it wasn't because he was busy. Very disappointed and will not recommend this restaurant!</text>

<Review>I was there on Christmas as well as the prior reviewer. Had a totally "bomb" meal. Can't believe she gave such a wonderful review, but only gave 4 stars....  ???? What's up with that? I have been going to your place for 15 years on my annual Big Sur drive and have been eating there every one of those years to enjoy a great piece of meat! If this app had 20 stars, I'd give it to you. Great service, location and the best steak on the west coast! Keep it up guys, see you next winter!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< Review>
Had been here 12 yrs ago and everything was great. This time, not so much. It wss a Tuesday evening, mid-August

Food -
The steak was excellent. The potatoes and onion rings were just right. But the bread and vegetables were poorly prepared. The beans should have been described better (spicy and dry vs sweet and tender) - i liked them, but my bf would have substituted them for a salad IF salad was an option. (And why isnt it?)

Environment:
Every few minutes a waitress would walk by hollering numbers, and the other staff would holler back. I guess it's "cute", but right in my ear was unnerving. Can't blame them for the screaming (literally) toddlers, but it made the visit a very unpleasant for the price, especially with the bussing station being centrally located - dishes being slammed around loudly...Wait staff was very kind.
The steak was not enough to make up for the rest, but maybe we hit them on an off day.<//Review>

Cool, casual and rustic...good food but over priced. Service is good and the wait was short...a one time experience is good enough for me. For me, there is nothing really setting the food apart from any other steakhouse...< /review>

Tasty food, large portions, but the Tritip steak was very tough and difficult to eat. Jan. 2020 disappointing but like this restaurant. 5 months prior it was excellent.</Text>

Ordered to "take out".  It is good that I did that because it is a 3 day holiday weekend and the restaurant was packed.  Parking was almost impossible. I ordered 2 of their very "pricey" hamburgers with cheese  (Comes with french fries and also onion rings and salsa) They were very good.<//text>

<text>We thought we'd try their thanksgiving dinner. Have been locals for 40 + years. It was a big disappointment. The turkey & ham dinners were like basic cafeteria food.Worst mashed potatoes & cranberry sauce I've ever had. Not worth The  $50 price tag. The service was good. Won't be going back any time soon.<//text></record>

< Review>
Got the trail combo,  steak, shrimp, ribs everything was excellent. Four stars because of price more expensive than the other two Mc Lintocks but then again it's a million dollar view. Couple of friends ordered the meat well done and got it blood rare. I did enjoy my endless onion rings and strawberry ice cream for dessert. Service from our waiter was very good.< /Review>

View of the 101. Pricey & hyped. Burgers are pricey & overrated. Steaks cost a ton. Needs renovation. Greasy food...think complementary fried Onion Rings.  Not Vegetarian friendly.
Service is very pleasant. Disappointing for the $. For tourist or locals who crave a steak.  Popular with locals for a special occasion.< /Text>

Celebrating with the family, 3 birthdays plus one on the way! Great meals my cousin Jack ordered a full rack of ribs delicious.
I had the porterhouse steak medium family style and a side Ceasar salad. I also had a 22oz Shock top a Moscow mule and a Amaretto sour. Everything was so delicious, will always be a favorite of the family!</review>

<review>Don't know what happened to this place.  We love coming to this restaurant when we go to Pismo. But this time it was not a pleasant experience whatsoever. We asked for a table for 2 and manager said it would be a 30 to 45 minute wait. I looked around and didnt see anyone waiting in the waiting area.  Manager then suggested we can go to the bar area and get immediate seating.  Well we did, but nobody ever approached out table. After a while I went back to the manager to let him know that we havent received any service yet. He sighed and said he would talk to the bartender. I went back to our table and noticed another table not getting any service either.  I also noticed empty tables in the dining area. By this time we had enough. I went back to the manager and told him that nobody ever came to our table. You'd think by this time he would take over and wait on the couple of tables or pull another server to the tables. Nope.  He did not. I told him that we were leaving. He just said ok.  There was a family of four standing there at the host station listening to this.  I dont know what he said to them, but as we were driving out of parking lot, we saw them walking to their car.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Have been eating at McClintocks Every time we come to this area. We live in Sonora Ca <--- not Sonoma. We love the atomophere and have never had a bad meal. Tonight was no exception to one of the best steaks I have ever had. My Wife had the petite filet and I had the Kansas City steak, oh my I cannot rave anymore about it. The red oak gives the beef such a unique flavor, the trail camp beans, the home style potatoes, the onion rings and the beverages are all top shelf. Our server April was awesome, thank you McClintock's for another awesome meal and the citrus serbert was great also.</Review>

the food is WAY over priced. i ordered the steak sirloin and i asked for it medium rare, when it was served to me it was well done and super dry! my order also came with shrimp with side of lemons. never received the lemons.  customer service was horrible and bad attitude. I wouldn't come back here . I will much rather go the Hitching Post in Casmallia.<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Our first time there. Was very disappointed. Went with friends that highly recommended it. All but one steak was way under cooked. Sent the steaks back to the kitchen to be cooked longer. One steak came back with a piece plastic buried in it and almost chocked our friend. They were not busy yet it took forever  to get our steaks back and by then our sides were either cold or gone and the whole dining experience was ruined.</review>< pics>

<review>This place was probably good twenty years ago, and I have no idea how they have so many good reviews now.

The decor is decrepit. The interior is dark and smells. The taxidermied animals are dirty and have obviously seen much better days. The tables and chairs are worn, and the carpeting is badly stained and in need of replacing.

The restaurant is understaffed, and the workers clearly do not put much effort into their jobs. The "hostess" said that it would be a few minutes and disappeared for about ten. She came back to greet a couple who had been waiting for several minutes and had a reservation. She disappeared with them and came back from the restaurant to grab menus and said, "I can take you now," as if it were an inconvenience.

There were several large parties, and the servers were clearly more interested in working those tables. A group with four children was sat with the kids across from us, instead of with them at the opposite end, bothering nobody. This removed any remaining appeal to the ambience.

The food is below average and very over-priced. My partner got the top sirloin. Even though it was cooked as directed, it was very tough. Although she was craving the meat, she simply couldn't force herself to eat all of it. She did enjoy the beans, which were spicy to her liking.

I ordered the pork chop. It was was also very tough and slightly dry. It lacked the strap of fat that should have made it moist and tasty. It came with a small bowl of cold applesauce, served as if just spooned out of the can in the fridge. Caramelize apples would have been a better match, fresh, and served warm. The rice pilaf was not nearly as good as stuff that you can get from a box.

The potatoes served with the meal were amazingly bland. I am one who generally prefers quite bland food, but had to make two rounds with the salt and pepper. The smattering of onions at the bottom were really the tastiest part of the potatoes.

The bread service was underwhelming. The basket only had two pieces of bread for two people. How long was that supposed to last? The bread itself was greasy and flat.

The sherbet was ridiculous. First, the word has only one "R" in it. The servers should know. Second, rainbow sherbet has more than just lime and a smattering of raspberry. The sherbet came in difficult to handle metal cups and clearly had been scooped earlier and then put back in the freezer. There were ice crystals in the bottom.

Finally, we had to wait a considerable amount of time for the bill. The credit card receipt came back with a felt tip pen to sign.

If the prices had been much lower, this might have slid by as acceptable tourist fare. However, for what they are charging, the food should be spot on and the service good.

I strongly suggest avoiding McClintock's. I don't think that it even qualifies as a bar pretending to be a restaurant. There are many better options nearby.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>For quality has gone down over the past decade or so. It's a nice place to eat of you're visiting the area, but you'll only see locals there if they want to stop by for their birthday dinner to get their picture on the wall. Food is just ok, prices are a little on the high side for the food quality.<//Text><Date>1437894456558</Date><user_id>109155326939681312818< /user_id><GmapID>0x80ec587d3dea6819:0xc455945d4c42463a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place has a very rustic atmosphere and they serve very large portions way more than I could possibly think of eating. It was fun and worth trying.</text>

<review>Very expensive that’s for sure.  However, the ambiance is worth a trip, your not going to see another steak house like it.  However, the meal was just ok for the price.  I probably would not go back in the future due to the high prices and the fact that the food was decent but not amazing.</review><user_name>Doug B<//user_name><user>107491880712661940732<//user>< pictures>

<Review>The atmosphere is rustic cowboy feel and the staff is very attentive to your needs.  The steak (ribeye) was cooked to order and was delicious.  The pricing is definitely above Outback but worth the trip.  The only knock is the clam chowder was not up to the local standards.< /Review>< pictures>

We had our company party there. They double booked our banquet room and they stuck us on one side of the restaurant. They really tried to make up for that, but it did put a damper on our party. That was unfortunate.<//text>

<review>Couldn't wait to have dinner here. Way overpriced. Ordered Tri tip, it was so salty we couldn't eat it. Shouldve sent it back but can't do that, respectfully anyway. Sides are lousy for price. Will never go back. Waste of our 117$. Expected much better.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80ec587d3dea6819:0xc455945d4c42463a< /gmapID></record>

<text>The food was good, but overpriced.  The waiters were friendly but the unique way they fill water glasses makes for a wet table and therefore wet sleeves should you touch the table.  I felt like I should have received a lot more food for the price or it should have tasted better...not that it wasn't good, just pricey for what you get.< /text>< user_name>

Ive been going here for years and years. The food has gotten more expensive .. less given and not great quality...  Waited for a table for 1 hour after being told 20 mins... was fine we had a drink but then disappointed when we saw all the empty tables....This time I went in for my anniversary. Told the waitress .. usually they celebrate it but didn't happen this time. Started with a salad which they used to include with dinner but changed a couple years ago. It was pretty much soaking in the ranch dressing and after 2 bites I just couldn't eat it. I wish there was just a medium amount.  By the time the server came back they had our main course. She said "oh you didn't like your salad? I explained but she just said "oh no"... No offer to replace and it was still on my bill in the end... The steak was small and I asked for medium well but it was pretty much raw... My wife's chicken breast was so think it was chrispy ,, Id tell you about other peoples food in my party but I think you get the idea... We hadn't finished yet. The bill came and they pretty much started clearin the table.. with empty tables around we didn't really get the rush... I read the reviews about others feeling its overpriced and it is... good quality or not the prices shouldn't be that high.... ... Just left feeling a bit let down for our special occasion....< /review>

Overcharged and mediocre taste on the steak. Overdone the first time around. Raw the second. Taste was not steakghouse quality. I expected more for the reputation. Everything else, service especially, was exceptional.</text>

Just left tonight and was so disappointed. We gave been coming fir years and always left happy.  Tonight they ofdered us a window table if we waited 10 minutes past our reservastion. Happy to wait, only to be taken to a middle table.  Then husband ordered a baxin wrapped filet,  he was served a top sirloin. When I made the rservation they asjed about anything being celebrated, yes his bday. Nope not celbrated as in the past. Potatoes were cold and blah. So very dissapoibted, guess that is why the parking lot was half empty on a Friday Holiday weekend.< /review>

<Review>Our waitress was rude. Didnt even take my hubbys drink order. Twice she ignored him. She acted strung out, maybe on something. We were there for 2 hours. She rarely came by to help. Got our drink orders wrong more than once. My filet was super well done and overly salted. I ordered it medium. My daughters steak was burnt and super salty. Hubby had rib eye. Also super salty. When i wanted to add to our order she avoided us.really bad experience for 140$. Especially since my filet alone was 50$. Definately not worth it and couldnt get my steak fixed because she never came back until it was time for her to get paid. Kinda ridiculous that everyone that came after us was gone before we even got to eat. And it wasnt even a huge order. Very disappointed. We splurged and should have just got something cheap.< /Review>< username>

<Review>Told waitress my spouse was allergic to nuts so she was served rice with almonds. Veggies had been frozen, mushy ick. You would expect that for a $10.00 dinner but not a $33.00 dinner. Burgers are $18.00. Not worth the price at all, Yuck.<//Review>< Date>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Well, after a long day of work my friend and I decided to drive to shell beach to Mc Lintocks for a drink and dinner. We wanted to sit at a table in the bar and listen  to the music. Waitress came to the table to get our order. We planned on ordering beef ribs, knowing that is what we get at the SLO mclintock's. Disappointed to find out that Shell Beach mclintock's does not carry beef ribs. Pretty bummed out so we decided to get the nachos but then soon to find out that they were out of nachos for the evening. Pretty bummed out about our second choice . Looking at the menu and nothing else really looked good for my appetite. The waitress was so nice and said it was her second day on the floor and was apologizing for not having what we wanted she then flipped over the menu and on the back side at the very bottom of the menu was a tortellini with blackened salmon  she was suggested for us to try. This is something I do not eat for one, I do not like salmon but the waitress said it was really good. We went a head and ordered it. I will tell you .... this was the best..... I mean the best tortellini and blackened salmon I have ever had. All the way home we were raving about how good that was. The dinner started out to be disappointing but ended up being fantastic. I wish I could remember the waitress's name she was super cute with dark hair and big round glasses she had an absolutely adorable smile and was so kind and helpful. If it weren't for her I definitely wouldn't have tried something out of my comfort zone. I am giving mclintock's a four star for their fantastic tortellini and you're amazing waitress. I am down one star for not having beef ribs. I will definitely be back.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1496243834311< /date>< user>

<Text>The food was okay, but I've learned from locals that this is a place that tourists go.  It's kind of depressing that a place looking at the ocean down't really have good seafood.  What I got was pretty bland.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It was my birthday and even though both the guy that took our reservations as well as our waitress asked about the occasion , they never took a picture or sang a birthday song . We all ordered steaks and all our steaks were salty . Perhaps the meat was old and they just used a lot of salt as preservatives . Not a good experience at all . I would not recommend this place at all .</Review>< username>

The food wasnt the best.  They get you in and get you out but you cant even enjoy ypur food because they are kinda pushy about getting you done and out of there. Won't go back<//Review>

The service was great. The food was okay but really not worth the money. The facilities are getting ran down. If the service wasn't so good this would be a 2.5-3 star.<//text>
