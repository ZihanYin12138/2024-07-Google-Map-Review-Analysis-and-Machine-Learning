<text>Food here is pretty par for KFC, but you can get an A&W root beer ... so it's just a little bit better.

The service here is a bit slow, but the folks are plenty  polite, so it's kinda a wash as far as that goes, generally when I want KFC I come here.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPITmR5oGb6rYK5O8I4m_NEnKsPBHmr7muHion-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80843e8a1485ac3d:0x2a99afa48529c4ab< /GmapID></record>

I love it!! Prices are very good. Chicken is always perfect. I can hardly wait for the new one on Broadway in Eureka.  If you like chicken, this is the best!< /text>

Grabbed a bite to eat on our way home from SF. Been here before and David is the most hard working, personable guy in the place. Always friendly. Always concerned with satisfaction of his guests. He has a great smile and a good attitude. This man should get a raise.</Review>

Would have been 5 star but only 3 other groups (1, 2 and 2 in each) and dining room had zero clean tables, grabbed handful of napkins and water from bathroom sink and cleaned one for us to use. There was a few cars in the drive through but had an employee dedicated for that. 2 people in kitchen area and 2 manning the counter...surely someone could give the dining room a quick wipe down. The cabinets were full of chicken, so they were not swamped. But food was great...hot fresh and tasted fantastic. Live less than 1.5
miles away and go here often; but usually drive through and often they are out of chicken (around 2 hours before closing) we will then drive to the Santa Rosa location and get chicken there. 14 mile round trip seems silly when there is this location so much closer...but when you want chicken, you want chicken!</Review>

<review>The food was ok but the tables & floor were dirty, as was the restroom. Looked as though the floor in ladies room had not been mopped for a very long time. Trash overflowing too. Only 2 tables occupied, including ours, so it seems as though tables could have been wiped & floor swept at the very least.<//review><Rating>3</Rating>< Time>

< review>
K F C has been severely torturing chickens for a very long time, over a decade. Look it up on a website called Kentucky Fried Cruelty. I cryed, it's excruciatingly sad. There's NO WAY I could ever patronize K F C, knowing that my money would be supporting DROWNING and SCALDING (at the same time) live chickens to death! And that's just some of the nauseating, heart-wrenching torture they endure. Please share the video on that website and please, please help these chickens by not supporting a business that severely tortures them to death! Thank you.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>If I'm going to be honest I don't drink that often, the real reason why I came into the establishment is because I wanted to support a friend who works there. With that said, establishment was clean, the jukebox was blasting favorable tunes, the patreons were seemingly having a good time laughing and talking, and of course I'm going to give high praise to the bartender Rajah who kept the drinks flowing smooth like honey!<//text>< Pictures>

Staff is nice. Very nice. But this place is dead and in the cold of the winter leaves the door wide open plus it smells like cat litter toward what used to be a kitchen? Anyways walk past the pool table towards the wall with the stage and you will smell what I mean, not to mention train tracks literally run right next to this place hence the name. They have 3 tvs playing. One is soaps the other telemundo news and the other futball.  And they are drowned out with sounds of the 50's playing from the juke box. If you don't like a crowd and want to chill here with just a few ppl you know then this is the apot for you.< /Text>

We did come at 8:40, but at 9:05 they started vacuuming the entire dining room while we tried to have a conversation.  By 9:10 the entire staff was hovering at the next table, watching us and talking loudly in Mandarin.  By 9:15 they told us "the register was closing" - it's an old style cash register and never closes!  Too bad I'll never go again because the food is really good and there are so few options out here in Oakland.< /Text>< Pictures>

Had Hong Kong crispy fried noodles. They were floating in oil, completely greasy. Veggies were completely overcooked. Horrible $15. Dish.</review>

Nothing horrible but the crispy duck was not that great and was mostly bones and fat. A little pricey for what you get too.< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Salesperson name Maria was handling my request of purchase....... my issue was that the truck i was interested in was being sold while she was running my credit and I literally ask how was everything going and she said she's waiting for other banks to get back at her, so the following day I called her back for a follow up and they told me she's busy and will give me a call back.... couple hours pass another Salesperson called and inform me that the truck have been sold to another person and if I was interested in another truck.... I told her why didn't they just told me that the truck was sold already now I have wasted my time and my credits was affected by running them..... not a good experience at all with this dealer.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Name>solomon baca</Name><review>Great service, friendly, and great prices. The process of buying my car was easy and they explained everything very well. I feel satisfied with my purchase. Definitely would recommend.

Since the day I bought it, they had told me about a problem with the car (I was told after all the paperwork was done) ,but to be fair I didn’t test drive the car so I can’t blame it all on them. They told me they were going to fix it in 2 weeks which turned out to be almost 7 weeks because I barely got it fixed yesterday. I was expecting a new part, but the part that they put in is used. This morning I got into my car and tried to start it and it just wouldn’t start. After a while of trying it finally started. Then, I drove it to the first stop sign and once I stopped, there was a really loud rattling sound.<//review><user>110598744011136866145< /user><Rate>2</Rate>< response>

<Resp>None</Resp><rating>1<//rating><text>Bought a 08 suburband from them. When we got there it was in the back and the battery was dead, which was no big deal the replaced it before we left. Few days later wife was driving down the road and the truck turned off causing her almost to crash. We had it towed to our house where I found the ground cable was complete broken due to them not putting the battery bracket back on the battery and the battery was sliding around under the hood. I told them that I could fix it for about a hundred dollars and I would do it myself since it was at my house, I am an ASE certified tech and I need the truck. I only wanted them to pay for the parts. They told no and that they would only pay for half or they wanted us to tow it to their shop they contract with. The truck was also missing a lot of things and we were not worried about it till this almost killed my wife. I don't not recommend  this dealership. Stay away.

Update: they also charged us license and registration and we got a notice from the DMV to pay 2018. When we asked they tried to tell us that's how they do it and when we told them I worked at dealership and know we paid for them they refunded us the funds. DON'T BUY FROM THEM THEY STEAL!!!!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Staff super friendly, affordable prices, high quality vehicles.  Bought a 12 Toyota Camry and I couldnt be happier. I absolutely love my car. Its been two months and no issues. Shout out to Marcos, Maria and Jr. They made the process quick and easy, answered all of my questions and got me a great deal. If you're looking to buy a car Esquivel is the place to go.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Sad to say how truly people like this car dealer can and will take advantage of nice decent people as myself. I genuinely gave my 3000 dollar down pay with no amount whatsoever given back . After the fact of getting two cars. First one had only three days motor went out. Then yes they took advantage again to place us in another car asking for more money down . That car broke too. Here I am with a six month old son and still without a car and no type of refund at a loss of my money down to end up with no transportation. In all fairness sad that this world has the crookedness I’ve experienced by coming to this dealer . Esquivel is about taking and not looking out for any type of customers period. In time hopefully Justice is served. Highly recommended to not think their cool .< /text><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

We just went back a second time to purchase a Chrysler 300 and again very impressed and happy. We worked with Junior and Pearl. They were terrific and took care of us. I highly recommend to any one! Will will be returning again in the future!< /Review>< time>

Just bought a used car from this Latino family owned place about a week ago and for the price, it was reasonable and worth it! Common sense, always know what to look out for if you decide to buy used. Saleswoman Maria sold me the car and she listened to me with whatever questions and concerns I had. She was very professional once I was ready to sign and also helpful with whatever I needed to know prior to signing. Overall, Maria made my experience pleasant throughout everything and I am happy with my purchase. I will recommend anyone that is looking for a car to see Maria! Thank you Maria!!!!<//text>

<Review>DO NOT!
i repeat do not do service with this dealer.
A family member of mine has been taken advantage by this company
In the past month she was given 2 vehicles
In which the first vehicle within 3 days the motor was totally shot .
It then took this company some pleading to get another vehicle to her . yet again after reaching out to them multiple times and being avoided she was given another vehicle which of course broke down 2 days later.
So now upon trying to reach them again regarding the issue they have clearly not helped or responded in anyway
She was even trying to just get the down payment back of $3,000 and they are totally ignoring her
To make matters worse she has a new born child and in dire need of a vehicle or at least the funds from the deposit back.
Terrible service from a terrible company
Please fair warning to all do not do business with them.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c34d732dba2737:0x3c2de20d897bde49<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The truth is you can buy a car in almost every corner. What you should look for Is service. Esquivel Auto depot has great service. They are not pushy like other car lots. They truly helped me and my family out with getting into a vehicle that would fit my family's needs.

Thank you Esquivel Family for helping us out. I will let everyone know that you provided a great service.<//review>

I was kind of skeptical on going with a used dealership for my brother but my friend recommended Esquivel Auto he advised me he purchased both his cars a Mercedes and a BMW with no issues and they even gave him warranty, his a trusted friend so I met with Marcos alongside my brother we finally found what my brother was looking for and as of now no issues fast, easy services and great car SELECTION. We were in and out in an hour. GREAT JOB EVERYONE! TRUSTED SERVICE</Review>

They rushed my boyfriend to get a car and didn’t even explain to him all the forms 4 days later he said he didnt want the truck anymore so the so called manager (the lady in the far left desk) told bring me my car and hung up in his face a. Total of 4 times while he tried to get and understanding of why he couldn’t get his down payment back After just 4 DAYS. These people are rude and don’t care about there customers at all and treat you as if you didn’t just give them your money DO NOT GO HERE</text>

I came in with no hope in getting a car, my credit was not that great! As soon as i walked in i seen a car i fell in love with! And i was able to drive out of there with the exact car i wanted! Marcos and the whole Esquivel team were great! They were the friendliest people ive ever met! They made me feel so welcomed and they didnt try to pressure me or anything like any other dealer would of! I highly recommend them! They also worked with me and they made my payments comfortable and affordable to the point were i wont be stressed out and fall behind. Thank you all! You guys were awesome!!< /Review>

<date>1499797507743<//date><rating>1<//rating><text>Super bad dealership. Worst ever. Bought a car from the a few month so ago. It was dirty from the exterior to the interior. The lights didn't work. The battery didn't work. Super dirty car. They only gave us one key, they claim that they don't have the spare even though we saw it on the test drive. Inside the building smelled like rotten egg. A horrible smell. They were changing a baby's diper in there. It just added to the smell. All of there cars are overpriced & aren't even in good condition. Bad experience. They also practically kicked us out after signing the papers & all that.< /text>< pictures>

I took it to Subaru mechanic shop and with in minutes they had a list of problems any mechanic would of seen if they only looked at the car. I payed out of my own pocket to get it fixed, then when I went to talk to them about all the problems it had they where very rude and didn't want to answer any of the questions I asked them, till this day the car has a ton of problems.

I went here after going to about 10 other car dealerships and all of them either told me i had too bad of credit and needed a cosigner or $5000 down and wouldn't work with me but as soon as i got to Esquivel and told them my situation they didnt hesitate to help me. I didnt need a cosigner or $5000 down and they gave me time to get my down payment and found me a car I loved for a great price and with awesome customer service! This is the place to go and they had a ton of cars to choose from!< /Review>

This place is horrible, the people there come off as nice but take no time to care about you because they're so tied into attending other people that came in after you in hopes to obtain a sale. My pregnant wife and I waited for hours, before our issue was resolved. These people don't care for you or your car after they made their sale. I bought an older vehicle and it was already starting to have issues a week after it came off the lot. they tell you to write in description what the problem with the vehicle is before your 30 day warranty ends. they only fixed one part and thought it was resolved. our car still has issues and our warranty is up. remember, this place is trash. the mechanics can easily remove the check engine light with a diagnostics machine. i'd suggest looking elsewhere because this place is a fraud.<//Text>

This person tried selling me a Chevy Cruze blue n color but when I started it up & check under the hood to check on a noise I heard & noticed that the engine was shaking , the sales person came out & said the down payment had went from 1500$ to 2300$ on a used car, I was told I had no credit ! Who has no credit ? U have either good or bad credit when I was told your credit didn't matter , your job was your credit ..... When ppl start speaking in another language they think u don't understand 9/10 times they are taking about u & it's not good ...... But once again HISPANICS  playing the race card .... Please don't think I'm saying this because I didn't get that car I didn't want because it would have cost me more in repairs after I drove it off the lot or I would have ended up.in court sueing them under the lemon law .

This car dealership is the worst ! They where nice at first willing to work with you... But after you sign there is a complete turn around very rude and not helpful at all! Once we drove the car off the lot it broke down they sent me to their so call mechanic that didn't do anything to the car ! Till this day that car is nothing but problems !  They are a rip off !! Regret getting a car here ! And also they showed us a car fax that didn't belong to the car ...we found out when we tried tading it in that it had been in a accident and on their report it showed nothing ... They are a scam should have looked at their bbb rating F!</Review>

They sold us a horrible condition car at a high price. Then they promise to fix it and after that the car come out looking good but in the next week it refuses to start. All the cars on there lot are broken or have been made to run but are NOT repaired. If u want to get ripped off like me and other people i know you go here.< /review>

High mileage high prices take you take your mechanic to verify what you are financing or buying. Cars look good but the check engine light might come on soon as you  finish the paperwork and leave the lot .</Review>

<Text>They sold me a car that only worked until I brought it home and then it broke down. There was so many problems with the car and when I took it to a Subaru mantientance shop there were more problems with the car than I can count. And when I took the car back to esquivel they said it was my problem. And they tried tacking on more money on the down payment then what we never agreed to on the contract. DO NOT GO HERE! They were horrible and will definitely rip you off!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Im glad this place knows what they are doing!!! Been to another dealer down the street, was promised me theyd approve me and nothing, had too return the car!! I was super upset!! ! Then my friend told me of ESQUIVALS.  I called and told them i had bad credit and what had happend at the other dealer. One of the girls that answered said, if you have income and a downpayment we can help. So i went down to look at the cars and was out in about an hour, long story short. Fast easy process, and got me approved.<//text>

Don't buy anything from here. It has been a nightmare for my husband and I. We bought a car and a week later it was already in the shop. They would never answer the phone. To make a long story short. The tranny was bad, from the first day and now we are stuck in a loan.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is very easy to qualify, they are very kind to serve you and the most important thing is that you go out driving the car you choose, it does not matter if you have all the down payment, because they give you favorable time to give it and they give you the car without problem, And very importantly, Ask for BRIAN PICADO And he will help you with pleasure and you will leave driving the car you NEED. 🚐🤗

(Original)
Es muy fácil calificar ,muy amablemente te atienden y lo más importante es que sales manejando el carro que escojes,no importa si tienes todo el down payment, porque te dan tiempo favorable para darlo y te dan el carro sin problema,Y muy importante, Pregunta por  BRIAN PICADO Y te Ayudará con mucho gusto y saldrás manejando el carro que NECESITAS. 🚐🤗< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I thought that they were more honest people, pity that I referred many friends, tried to change my car than I had a year ago and it turned out that they never found my husband's credit history and it was sadder than Marcos that I solved this and even Ahortia did not want to answer me. the calls are wrong

They have a small gift area and even crafting supplies which i think is great. Every time i am in wawona its my go to for anything i need! Oh and on pi day I forgot to get a pie and they had 3 flavors it was pretty good pie and a lemon sorbet made my pi day even more special. Local shop with a friendly shop keeper!< /review>< pics>

Very well stocked general store.  Most meat items are frozen, however, you can ask the clerk if they have anything fresh refrigerated, which they usually have.  Plenty of food items, as well as an assortment of camping needs, magazine rack, local artwork, and fishing supplies.  Great ice cream selection.  Well worth a stop when visiting Wawona.<//text>

The new owners are amazing and super friendly. I had forgotten my gas canister and they went to a different store to get us one, and now make sure they keep them in stock for forgetful backpackers. They were angels and I will never forget their kindness. They also had fabulous fruits and snacks for our drive home.<//Text>

Always like to shop here when we stay at the cabin. Friendly people and they always seem to have whatever we need when we are in the middle of nowhere.</review>

A bit confused but very well furnished shop, it saved our grill-party during our stay in the park!< /text>

Wonderful store with amazing owners and staff. We came by to get some engine coolant and everyone was so helpful in figuring out what we need. Truly selfless, good people. We ended up coming back here for all our yosemite needs including a whole kit for smores!  Thank you to the pine tree market crew!!</review>

Friendly staff, great supplies, nice place to buy what you need for yosemite and surroundings. We also bought delicious cookies from kids in parking lot. That’s a place we definitely will use again when visiting the park. 5 huge stars!!<//text>

<review>My family has a cabin a few lots over. The deal is GO THERE for ice cream and beer! The best desserts are at the cabin! They have fresh produce, a large varirty of staples, and a good selection of "gear" in case you found out you need it.
This store has the best t shirts around, especially if you feel "local".
The people in the market are the nicest people you want to know. It's like old home week......</review>< Pics>

We were staying in the area for a couple days while exploring the park and this market had everything. Lots of staples that we needed while we rented a house and incredibly helpful stuff who suggested places to eat/visit in and around Wawona. Couldn't have asked for more.< /Review>

<Review>If you're staying in Wawona (or even nearby), Pine Tree Market is a great place to get ice, beer, sodas, fresh produce, cheese and lunchmeat, ingredients for larger meals, and a great selection of wine and spirits. The staff is friendly and helpful too! Expect rural prices.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Well-stocked little grocery store in the Redwoods at Yosemite vacation rental area, with everything you could want to cook in your vacation rental house. We picked up stuff for salad, fruit, and even New York steaks! The Wawona gas & grocery on the main road is good for souvenirs, but the Pine Tree is a better grocery store. We stocked up at the Von's in Oakhurst before arriving in Yosemite, but with 3 nights in the park and six hungry adults to feed, we inevitably ran out of food - thank goodness for the Pine Tree.</text>

Convenient little market in Wawona. One of two stores in the area.  They have what you need for the short term, i.e. booze, beer and food.  Limited hours (9-7) but it's a small town.</review>

If you come empty-handed and unprepared to the park you can buy almost everything for the trip here. Of course it is a bit more expensive than a normal store, but there is not other store nearby. Staff is kind and friendly.<//review>

<Text>We were referred to Allied Auto so we brought a 2006 truck in for a purchase inspection and were so impressed with the detailed explanation and cost of each item needing work.  The list was long!   We decided not to proceed with the work but Matt was so helpful and took it a step further, explaining what the most important items would be to take care of first if we were to go elsewhere. He was so helpful and we really appreciated his expertise and not feeling pressure to proceed. We won’t be hanging on to the truck but I will definitely be bringing my car in when it’s time for servicing! It’s nice to have local shops you can trust!<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pictures>

We've been bringing our cars to Allied for 5-6 years. Started with older models that weren't worth taking to original dealer for service. The team at Allied has always been prompt in responding, provide fair prices for their work, and we've never had any issues with work they've done on our cars. We've started bringing our newer cars here too now. They're convenient to our home and provide complimentary drop off/pickup service within a certain radius.</review>

<Review>I had an odd experience here. They gave me a $188 oil change with a $100 labor charge without providing an estimate first. California's Automotive Repair Act says an estimate must be provided first.
They wanted to charge me over $700 to reseal valve covers, about double what most shops would charge -- and it wasn't necessary, according to the second opinion that I got. As a tie breaker, I parked my car over some paper: no sign of a leak.
This shop very thoroughly checked my car for problems, finding several other issues including a brake light that needed to be replaced, yet they did not even mention that my check engine light was on.
This is probably a great shop to use if you have a nice car and lots of money to spend. I do not; the total cost of the suggested repairs was double the blue book value of my car.< /Review><user_id>104328412811779134329< /user_id>< Name>

The team at Allied Auto Works was awesome. Explained the issues with my vehicle very well and helped with the decision that it was not worth fixing the car. I appreciated their honest assessment—they had my best interests at heart rather than just their bottom line. They even oriented the car so it would be easy to tow away when I was ready! They were recommended by a friend and I would definitely recommend them to anyone seeking an honest mechanic.< /review>

They do a great job here for a fair price. The work is excellent quality and they’re very honest. They let me know things to watch in the future that may need servicing but don’t need it yet. I’ve been going to them for about 3 years and I’ve never been disappointed. You can trust them with your car. Lots of the locals use them.<//Review>

I use allied Auto works exclusively for all issues general and specific that come up along with annual maintenance procedures for my Mazda speed 3. Matt and all of the personnel and repair and maintenance people are extremely professional from their greeting when I call to their professional knowledge and describing and suggesting what procedures should be checked and addressed and they are always spot on. Their quote over the phone when I call and explain what my vehicle is doing they will give me an estimate and have been extremely fair in their practice and addressing and repairing all issues with my vehicle. These people have always been extremely professional and knowledgeable when discussing when I explain in layman's terms my vehicle's problems. I would recommend them unconditionally as an extremely fair and knowledgeable business to have work done on my vehicle. They are my one-stop shop for all my automotive questions and recommendations and repairs.<//Text>

<Review>Professional, priced fairly, efficient, honest, and competent mechanics here. It’s hard to find a good bmw mechanic- it’s even harder to find one that prices fairly, and almost impossible to find one that is all of the above and honest. This place is solid. Excellent place to leave your Bimmer.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>You can’t get a better quality of service and professionalism than at Allied Auto Works. They make you feel like your vehicle is the most important one in the shop. Before starting any work on your car, they call you to discuss the issues to ensure they have your approval to proceed. And I have stopped by unannounced more than once with a car concern, and they immediately come out and check for problems. They are a family run business and treat you like you are part of their family! They are the best!<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

<Review>I took my 300D Mercedes in for the installation of a new door striker on the driver's door.  The old one had simply worn out and the door did not close completely.  Brian could not have been more helpful and professional since we had come in without an appointment.  He confirmed that he could do the work and have it complete later in the afternoon. Within an hour or so,  Allied called to say the work was complete and ready for pickup.  When we returned to the shop, Brian spent several minutes going over the work and confirmed that the door was closing properly.  We greatly appreciated his concern with the problem and the fair pricing for the service.  We'll certainly return for additional service and recommend Allied Auto Works highly.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The dealership told me I needed a new engine at $11,000.  My wife and I both spoke with Brian and felt really good about his approach to the diagnostics.  They were able to pinpoint the problem areas and make the repairs for a fraction of the cost.  In a very timely matter I might add.  Matt was very helpful as well and very articulate and knowledgeable.  We will definitely be clients going forward.</review>

After having to schedule a week in advance and then going to my local Audi dealer for my 95K checkup and getting a ridiculous quote, Allied was able to service my car and flush the cooling system for 50% of the dealer service quote.  The car was ready on time, washed and I will be using them going forward for all out of warranty service.</text>

We have had Allied Auto service or repair four different vehicles including German and Japanese models and they have always diagnosed any issue accurately and communicated our options clearly for us to make a decision before continuing.  Their work has always met or exceeded our expectations and they are pleasant  and professional to deal with in person and on the phone.< /review>

I was looking for a new repair facility for my vehicles. I pulled into Allied Auto to talk about my problem with my F150. They were very knowledgeable about the existing problem that my model has. Told them I needed to be able to trust a facility, being I have worked with cars and trucks all my life. They told me what was needed and I told them to go ahead. Truck done on time an d fair price will be bringing all my other cars for work when they need it<//Text>

I've had a great experience with Matt and the team at allied auto works with both of our cars.  High quality repair work, good pricing relative to dealerships, and always checking in before doing any major work. Great customer service as well.<//Text>

Allied auto has always been able to explain clearly the  reasons for repairs and the risks of not doing them.  I had some oil leaks and fixed one because it could have caused damage if the leak continued. Allied Auto’s explanation made sense and helped me with my decision.< /text>

Matt was very understanding with what I asked him to do besides the regular service. It was my first time to go to Allied. He made sure that he knew everything that was done the last time before I come to Allied. He had my car done as I asked and on time to be picked up.
Kyle, the shuttle driver was pleasant and punctual also.
I do recommend Allied to anyone< /review>

We came to the mechanic with a pretty much broken car and instead of repairing it and earning money, they recommended to cut our losses. Matt, Brian and the other mechanics were really helping us out and try to keep our mood up. We could even use their phone all day long to organize things. They tried calling a few places as well in our name to help us out to get rid of the car. Very nice and reliable mechanics!!< /review>

<Review>The team here is awesome. I've been bringing in my 1998 Honda Accord since I moved here, and I've found a mechanic I trust. They take the time to explain the work that needs to be done to your vehicle and when they actually do the work, they do it with exceptional quality. Additionally, their prices are much better than any dealership!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb6a800172417:0x613e04b3f088f2b1< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I appreciate their flexibility.  I was supposed to pick the car up in the afternoon but my return from a trip was delayed until after the shop was closed.  I needed the car early the next morning.  Travis put the second key under the mat, I picked the car up on my way home from the airport and settled up the bill the following day.  I have been a customer for over 20 years so I am sure they know where I live, but just imagine the local car dealer working out that arrangement with you!< /Review>

I came across AAW through Nextdoor when I looked for advice on car maintenance, and everyone gave high marks on them. I decided to give it a try. I called and made an appointment and the process was smooth and easy. When I dropped off my car to the shop, Travis was very patient to listen to my request and came up with a suggestion to diagnose the issues and gave me a very reasonable estimate. During mid morning I got a call from Travis telling me the maintenance work and repair was completed. He spent time to explain to me the issue and how they fixed it. The written report on my invoice was thorough and identify issues to look out in the future. I also got a first-time customer discount which was a pleasant surprise. The final bill I would conservatively estimated as a fraction of what I would expect to pay at the dealer. Not only because it is a neighborhood business that I prefer to support, the professionalism and honesty makes me feel very comfortable to recommend them to any of my neighbor. Travis is a rock star in my opinion. If they can offer a shuttle service within the city, even a paid one they will get my 100 mark. Now is only 99.9.</Review><username>Frank Ip</username>< user_id>

<time>1415997271674</time><Review>My 1984 Honda CRX has carburetor problems. It basically dies on me when slowing down and stopping.  It needs a new carburetor, which is hard to find for this car and model. After visiting several auto shops, all telling me the problem can't be fixed, I got a referral to Allied Auto Works. They adjusted the idling from 200 rpm to 1200 rpm and the car is now safe to drive.I not only appreciate their honesty, but the fact that you get transport to and from your home.< /Review>< user_id>

They say if you find a doctor, mechanic, or lawyer you can trust, stick with them as they are hard to come by. Well, I've found my mechanic. They do fantastic work and have reasonable prices. They go above and beyond what they need to do and are extremely friendly to boot.<//Text>

Matt Ahern the service manager was friendly and professional. I recognized him at the time of my appointment as I knew him from his prior employer. Work was done in a timely manner; and was the price quoted over the phone. I also talked with the mechanic who worked on my car. He was friendly and knowledgeable about my car (Saab). Where some mechanics tend to shy away from them as they're not familiar with them. I would not hesitate to refer them to friends and family.< /Review>

We have services our BMW in Allied Auto Work for the past 4 years. They always provide quick and exceptional service. On many occasions, we just walked with a problem without making an appointment and ALL of those times they took us in and helped us immediately! They are amazing! Still a customer and will remain for as long as I can I have cars. Irina Boucher< /Review>

Allied Auto Works came highly recommended, so I brought it in and the folks there diagnosed it right away.  The big old traction battery (after 12 years and 170k miles) was finally dying.  I left my car there, confident they would take care of my little hybrid, and they did.  They ordered the battery and installed it right away, and my car and I have been happy ever since.  Every person I interacted with at the shop was courteous, friendly and honestly seemed to have my car's best interest in mind.  Plus they took the time to explain things and answer questions for me - a huge plus in my book.<//text><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

< review>
My family was on our way to the mountains when my truck blew a coolant hose at the gas station. I quickly googled the closest auto shop and Allied Autoworks was right around the corner. My truck is a diesel and so I figured it was a shot in the dark that they would be able to help but I drove over anyways. The staff was incredibly friendly and sympathetic to my situation and immediately dove in to take a look. They located the leak and did a little research to figure out the size of a tiny hose that had developed a pin hole. Even with the shop packed with vehicles, they saw that I was in distress having two young children with me and they prioritized the repair getting me in and out in an hours time. My family and I were able to reliably continue our drive and have a great weekend. I love businesses with extremely great customer service and Allied Autoworks gives the best customer service I’ve seen. I cannot recommend this place enough. Give your business to people who care about you and your needs. Take your vehicle to Allied.</review>

Received a promotion mailing that said this exact store opened at 7:30a.  When I got there the bays were open with two mechanics.  I went in and a mechanic came in to say someone would be with me; that was at least polite.  When I went back out I saw no one except for the mechanics working, so I asked who would help me.  This is when they told me the manager would be in SOON!  Then they proceeded to tell me they normally open at 8am.

So the workers DON'T know when they open and apparently the manager doesn't know when they are open or s/he doesn't care when they get to work.  The place looked in disrepair with some kind of breakage in the parking lot which no one was bothering to pick up and the lock on the office door was in disrepair.  The office smell faintly of smoke.

All of this told me not to expect good service.  Better luck to you if you go here.< /Text>

My car was there for 2 days. They toll me that the job would be around  $3200 because my car needed an engine. When my husband's friend took a look we just needed an air conditioning and a power steering belt. We didn't spend more than a $100 on it !!. Always ask for a second opinion. DO NOT TRUST THEM !!!!< /Review>

<Text>DO NOT GO THERE.
I had my car inspected yesterday for my muffler at Meineke Car Care Center. The agent estimated the repairs at $7000 with tax and advised me that the whole exhaust system was to be replaced. Today I went to two other car centers, Larry H Miller Nissan and El Caballo Muffler and auto repair shop, and was advised that these repairs would in fact be around 30-40$.
Meineke Car Center is a very unreliable source that tries to scam people based on gender, race and nationality.

Avoid this place
This was all that needed to be fixed< /Text>< pictures>

As such, we are obligated to perform repairs properly, legally, and to industry standards; and in such a manner that we can stand behind that repair for the duration of our very long warranty.\n\nSabrina, you have a Canadian car with a very rusted exhaust. One cannot just simply weld or retrofit pieces of new exhaust onto rust. The proper repair is what we recommended. The repair we recommended is also the LEGAL repair to perform, given that we're also dealing with an emissions device called a catalytic converter. Your exhaust studs on the engine were also corroded and likely to cause problems once the exhaust system is disturbed during a repair, among other issues. Additionally, it's worth noting that the estimate/quote we gave you included other items like replacing your tires, which are dangerously worn out.\n\nWe'll concede that you'll likely find someone out there willing to repair your vehicle improperly and illegally to save you money, but we hold ourselves to a higher standard and cannot operate our business that way. But it's certainly your prerogative to repair your vehicle where and how you wish.  As to your absurd and slanderous accusation of gender, race, and nationality bias, it's just that - absurd, slander, malicious, and nothing more than theatrics."}</response><GmapID>0x80c3537eafab0221:0xd606b879d7da28f1<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place. They were about to close and i really needed my car fixed so the manager and his staff stayed 3 hours late to help get it fixed. The manager was really nice and explained in detail what was wrong with my car and what had to be fixed. Very caring employees. Decent prices. Will be back if needed to.<//review>

Thanks again Ozzy!!

I had A great experience.  As a female I was scared to be taken advantage of by A mechanic. Jesse at Meineke was very friendly and took me in the shop to show me what was wrong with my car. Being A woman I usually just have to take the mechanics word not knowing much about cars... I thought that was honest of him showing me my power steering leak... I seen it so it was soothing to pay for my repair.. I old recommend this place to my family.< /review>

Miguel Valdes center manager is an awesome person!
Very caring, professional, and courteous. Always a smile on his face.
Always has my needs met, my questions answered, and if I come in and there is any waiting I can choose to wait, or he will give me the best time to come back that, or by the following day.
Always informs me of anything that needs to be checked now, or in the upcoming future.
Always makes me feel like he has known me for years, and makes me feel like part of this professional family.
I have any questions or concerns they are answered.
I have felt from day one this is such an honest and respectable business. You never feel taken advantage of like so many other places.
I recommend this place, and prices are fair.

{'time': 1549210283542, 'text': 'David,\n\nWe\'re not sure where the confusion originated but we apologize that there was confusion regarding your inquiry. Our manager quoted you an "ESTIMATE" of $800 for the labor and explained that the parts would be unknown until we perform the teardown. The manager emphasized that this is only an "estimate" and further emphasized that we recommend a preliminary diagnosis on your vehicle, then a teardown to assess precisely what\'s needed. Until then, there\'s no way to provide an exact price. Of course, in this process we\'d provide an estimate for each step and obtain your approval before performing any work.\n\nAdditionally, cylinder head gasket repairs (replacement) can definitely be performed on the Cadillac Northstar engine. In fact, head gasket failure is a common problem in these engines. They are prone to leaking and to the head bolts pulling out from the block. We have performed these repairs many times, as have other shops and the dealer - avoiding engine replacement in many instances. Now, it\'s possible that SOMETIMES it could be more economically feasible to replace the engine rather than pay the price for head gasket repair - depending on what is found in the teardown. But until the repair has been fully assessed and the math added up for both options, we\'d avoid recommending one fix over the other. (An assessment should always be performed first). Perhaps this is the source of your misinformation.\n\nPlease give us a call, David. We\'d love to discuss this in greater detail and address all the facts and repair options with you.'}</resp>

If I could I wouldn't give them one star. They charged me to look at the cat because they just didn't believe me even though I had paperwork to prove what was wrong. They wanted to over charge me to fix something simple. Than told me I had to get everything fixed that they don't just fix what I'm complaining about. They just saw a young lady with a nice cat and tried to get over. Horrible customer service. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing here! They left my doors unlocked with all my windows down in the day with my vehicle parked by the street! My car was so dirty when I got it back. Worst place ever!</Text>

I was scared to death about my car and expected an expensive repair. The manager was so nice and put me at ease, giving me a cold bottle of water. He got the car in right away and then walked me out to the car and showed me a torn up belt. They got the car done in about an hour and it wasn't expensive at all. I was very relieved. These will be my mechanics from now on.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I know our manager advised you of the requirement to replace your alternator from the beginning but you opted not to do it.  This is the first we hear in about six months, since your visit, that there's dissatisfaction. We'd like to discuss this with you to see what can be done to earn your satisfaction; but we have not received a returned call from you. Please call us at your soonest convenience to discuss this. Thank you."}< /response><Text>I previously gave this location 5 stars but I had to change it. If I could give this place negative stars I would. Miguel fixed my car, 2 oil leaks to be exact, but not only is my car still leaking oil, another location said they don't know how Meneike could possibly have known where the leaks came from because there was oil everywhere. Then my daughter's BMW was over-heating and Miguel said it was the engine and it would cost over $5000. After they "replaced" the engine, it kept over-heating. Then we got the water pump fixed and it kept over-heating. He even said he fixed the thermostat and it's still over-heating. Then her said it's the alternator and that's why it's over-heating. Are you kidding me!!! Not only is the car not fixed or even running, but we're still paying for an engine that another location said is the same engine that was originally in there, but probably just had some parts changed. I'm sooooo upset! NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR TO THIS LOCATION!!!< /Text><time>1541392128461</time>< GmapID>

< review>
This Meineke location is trash! I went there for a simple belt replacement and it took them an hour to check me in. I booked my appointment online and waited for an hour, the mechanics didn't even work on my car. They sat around the auto shop joking around and saying derogatory things in Spanish about the customers. DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION!

The owner responded below and I want him to know I did call the customer service line and they had me on hold for 15 minutes, no one picked up. I decided to go to Jiffy Lube instead and received excellent and speedy customer service. The guy changed my serpentine belt in 30 mins flat. DON'T GO TO MEINEKE, SUPPORT JIFFY LUBE</review>

You walked in and our manager, while helping another customer, greeted you and said he\'ll be right with you. By the time he finished with the customer ahead of you, you had stepped out. So he walked to the glass door, took a really good look outside, but didn\'t see you. You then walked back in a short time later (no where near an hour later) and he wrote you up.\n\nWhen you say, "waited for an hour," we\'re assuming you\'re referring to the completion of your car and not the time it took to write you up, right? We tried to reach you to address all this, so we can do everything to ensure your satisfaction but you haven\'t called us back as of yet. Please give us a call so we can work toward your complete satisfaction.'}<//Resp>

I came in with only a 2 hour notice to the new manager Jesse, he took his time to hear out what I wanted to get done about the breaks then he gave me his suggestion on what was wrong with them, he suggested I get the rotors redone or replaced, I honestly thought "I should just stick with my choice" but after thinking about it we ended up just replace 2 of them and the brakes which ended the noise that had been coming from one wheel and the price for all the work was almost $400 less than jiffy and a few other places. I will be coming here from now on since the one by me closed and it only took them 40 minutes to get it all sorted and done.

Etc things that did not need any fixing. adding up to 2,100$! Worth he is very shading an take advantage of young people who does not know to much about cars, I was charged double times on esitmate form, He also forged my signature on documentation thay I did NOT sign. Please dont come to this SHOP they will work you and do illegal corruptive activities!! Refused to give me copies of paperwork "SAID IT WAS NOT NEEDED" lied an told me my car would be ready that same day at 7pm when shop closed at 6pm, so unprofessional no one from establishment called me an explained my car has not been worked, nor it was not going to be , and if it was okay to keep the "Customer" car . Without permission. I suggest everyonw report to BBB better business bureau Automotive if you too have been a Victim an their scheme they call a "Business".< /text>

<text>I was on my way to work early and my car started to get hot. So I made it to work and was worried about my car. I called A few shops to see if I can get help. Jesse the manager at Meineke not only was kind but also told me to not drive it. if it is heating up because I could blow my heads. He offered to have it towed to his shop and have it inspected free.  I asked if they have A tow truck ? He said no but work with A tow company. He had my car picked up and takin to his shop and found out it was only the upper radiator hose leaking and called me to see if I approve to have it repaired.. Of course I said yes.. I didn't get overcharged or he didnt lie and say it was A bunch of other stuff to make money like most shops do.  It was A minor repair that got fixed before I got off work . To think it could have cost me nearly A $1,800 Head job or possibly A replacement engine... Verry happy and will be back for sure. I found A new honest repair shop. I will recommend them to anyone.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

{'time': 1519407309035, 'text': 'David, your accusation is quite bizarre and unusual, as we\'ve not once in our business history had such an allegation made against us. Additionally, we have a signed (wet signature) original repair order and a signed (wet signature) revised repair order, time stamped during the time when you were physically at our shop, that contains the new/revised estimate for the full amount of the work we completed. Also, the research we have conducted, thus far, after our telephone conversation of a few days ago has revealed that a series of security questions were answered electronically (via computer) with the financing company, through which your repairs were financed. These are very-obscure-type security questions, that only the signatory to the loan would know - such as, "On which street did you live from 1982 thru 1987?" Then 5 or more multiple choice answers to each question are given. I assure you that we take this accusation very seriously and our investigation is still on-going.'}<//resp>

Guy named Oscar ruined this place for me.
Suuuuper unhelpful and was just asking for money.

All I needed was my a/c system flushed and he quoted me 300 dollars.

There's just no honest people at that place.< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1519685841412, 'text': 'Moslyn, the repair on your car was completed on 8/25/2016 (ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO). Not once have we heard from you with any complaints until this review from two days ago. I have left you a few messages over the last couple of days but have not heard back. We are extremely perplexed as to your leaving a review with such horrible accusations almost two years after your visit and not once having previously complained or contacted us in any other way regarding the issues you voiced in your review. As to the main issues you bring up: We have in hand an invoice from the supplier of the replacement engine that we put in your vehicle, as well as documentation of the numbers from your original engine (that we took out) and the numbers on the replacement engine we put in. I assure you with the greatest degree of certainty that your vehicle did receive a replacement engine that was a used unit, as you were advised by us, agreed to, and as is documented on your paperwork that you signed. That can be easily verified by comparing the numbers on that engine now in your car against your Vehicle Identification Number. Perhaps the confusion stems from the fact that the replacement engine was used, again as you agreed, and therefore does not and cannot appear new. Second, we replenished the replacement engine with 4.5 quarts of Toyota Long-Life coolant (the engine\'s capacity is 4.5 quarts), for which you were billed $29.95 - NOT $50. Third, your total bill, out-the-door with tax, was $2,473 (Grand Total, parts & labor) for an engine, water pump, cooling system hoses, new spark plugs, and Radiator cap. Really not sure what you mean by "$3000 + and $200." I challenge you to shop that price and you\'ll clearly see that what little we charged you was in fact a bargain. Lastly, we do not and never have had a theft problem at our facility. But there\'s the possibility of circumstances beyond our control, since we are open to the public. We do our utmost to secure our premises, including an alarm system and a video surveillance system. The problem, though, is you\'re barely now - two years later - bringing any of this to light. How can we possibly investigate the alleged theft of your "Apple mini music player" this long after your visit to our shop? Please contact us as soon as possible to discuss these issues in greater detail and to allow us the opportunity to resolve anything requiring attention. (909) 886-5415'}< /Resp>< Text>
They suck they over charged me said they replaced engine with a use on they put the some one back in charged me $50 for coolent in a Scion XA small car don't hold that much in charged me $3000+ and $200 to get my car using there credit program 2 of them and stole my apple mini music player when they had my car for almost a week the Guy at the counter is very very shady no thumb up for them you have to leave a message<//Text>

<Review>Yummy coffee, delicious thai tea, and a cold vanilla cream blended drink. Very delicious, affordable and bigger portions than starbucks. So glad I came here. I recommend the tea as it's naturally sweet. The food provided is unique and healthy. I recommend anyone who want something different. You can also get a 10% discount if you went shopping next door at valley pure. Just show receipt.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Munchies is a really good place to go I really Enjoy there drink they taste very good, but today I was very upset with them because I was really craving coffee so my mom was rushing over there because we seen that it was going to close at 6 and there was a closed sign at 5:30ish and yes I am Aware that there is a global crisis at the moment but they should really change the time that it is going to be on google so that people could know not to go if it’s going to be closed. Other then that I really enjoy there drinks.<//Review>< Pics>

The employees are very nice, they don't talk on the job, and they will make you a great drink. I recommend it to every person I know. It's not very expensive either.< /text>

A great find!  Excellent coffee, muffins and service. In my opinion, the short size coffee is the best size for a latte. Even though it is not on the menu, Crystyllene made one for me and that’s why I give my 5 star rating. 🤗</review>

As a frequent customer, I highly recommend stopping by Munchies to enjoy a delicious green tea latte or your favorite coffee! There's so much more; variety of fresh crisp salads or hot soups... and the bake goods are excellent. The best part, Munchies offers vegan options!!! I have a great respect and appreciation for the extraordinary dedication of the general manager, Kari... reflected in the cozy atmosphere and positive staff. The drinks, good food and friendly staff is what keeps me coming back!</Text>

Great baked goods. The chocolate chip cookies are great. The Italian sodas are awesome. My mom loves the soup and sandwich combo. Very clean, sanitary, nice modern interior. Very cozy for a sit down and great to go service.<//review>

<Text>I heard about munchies on Instagram and decided that me and the wife needed to make a trip to Woodlake to try it.  We saw that they had vegan cheese and other vegan treats so we had to go try it. Being vegan isn't easy in The Valley but with places like munchies whose owners both are vegan truly makes me happy. I'm happy to support munchies. The food, the ambiance, the staff was all incredibly nice and pleasant I cannot recommend it enough.  Munchies being next  to Valley Pure definitely seems like Wood Lake is ahead of the game.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809539d61ae646d9:0x284e16213e50fbec< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing place I met my girlfriend for the first time there and we had a 7hr coffee date, the best place to do studying or to get some work done if you need a quiet place. Excellent service and I would recommend this place to everyone I know.<//review>

<text>The coffee was decent but the service was not the best. I went in with the intention of buying at least 6 coffees but after I ordered the first one the lady immediately told me how much it would be so I said ok and continued to order. She told me the total again and I just figured she must have a rush to get to the one other customer in the bulding so I stopped I had ordered and went to the usual donut shop. Great service there. Smiles everywhere and very nice people. On that note, hospitality is key when you're serving customers and your attitude and body language say a lot. A smile would go a long way.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I was on my way to visit my grandmother who lives in Exeter, i stopped at Munchies on my way. I always like to suppport small business in our community.  Horrible service.  The woman working the counter had no personality and was very cold. The man who made the two drinks was completely rude. I told him thank you and he looked at me like a was speaking another language.  Maybe they knew i was from out of town (visalia) and they only like locals. Who knows. I will never go back. I also would never recomened this place to anyone i know.<//Text>

Sonoma county is rich in history and this museum is worth a visit. Call ahead to arrange a docent tour.  We took the SMART train north to downtown Santa Rosa for a walking tour of the old town. The museum is not far (10 minute or so walk) from the train station. Plan to have lunch or dinner in one of the many restaurants downtown.</review>

Great price for a day of looking at amazing art. Inside and outside.
My children love it.
They offer free parking.
If you need to leave for whatever reason you can come back later with your receipt and continue looking.
It's right downtown so it's easy to find and in a beautiful building with so much of its own history.  Then curators know so much and are so willing to help with any questions you may have.
I love the little gift.shop they have.< /review>

The building is great. It was an old post office. Wood work inside is beautiful. Along with 4 safes built into the walls. The most amazing thing to me was. In the 70's the building was moved 150 yards to it's location today. It was the only building saved and moved. So the Santa Rosa Mall could be built. Post offices are built like banks or bomb shelters. So I'm sure it was no easy task.
Three stars because it cost $10 to enter. It's more of a art museum not so much on history. But for that $10. It will get you in their next door building. The actual art museum. Both buildings are rather empty. Both don't need to be art. Show some history.<//review>

<Text>Found this by chance, only half an hour before it closed. Even so, had to pay full price, though the ladies were very nice about it and very helpful answering questions. Downstairs had a lot of interesting information, upstairs just a picture gallery.< /Text>< Pics>

The current (rock posters, etc) show, although very important and well displayed, missed a grand opportunity to honor the true reason for their show: The Amazing, Talented LOCAL Artists that did the art!!! Artists that live right here!! The SoCo Museum needs to correct this obvious oversight immediately by inviting Timothy David Dixon to accept an award given at the Closing Ceremony of the show. Robert Hunter, as well.. Seriously, to use Mr. Dixon's original artwork on the advertising for the show... And then not acknowledge his talent with a thank you is an amazing insult to all of us lifetime Sonoma County residents whose lives were forever changed by these inspiring works.</Review>

My experience started off great because i was on a field trip with a small group of people and we were given a guided tour of the whole museum but at times it was a lot to take in because he was explaning things so fast. Also their is lots of time spent standing< /Text>

Very nice for a small local museum.  The space is great and well utilized and the exhibition programs are always  interesting and rotate frequently.  A must if you want to learn and just enjoy art.<//review>

The history of the building itself is interesting.  They put on good history and art exhibitions.  The history museum side has NO changing tables for kids, though.  Big bummer.<//Text>

Such a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. The history building in itself is a beautiful piece of art and when it's sunny and warm, the sculpture garden is a treat. Two museums for the price of one was a score.</review>

<Text>BEYOND BOLLYWOOD- Exhibit at the Sonoma County Museum,Santa Rosa, California. Speechless was I for a long time after I left the museum. What an amazing capsule of the history of Indian Immigrants and their contribution to the American Scene, a treasure indeed did I see. For Indophiles and especially for East Indians both young and old this a must. For here one can walk through time itself, from way past to the present. Pictures reflecting personal histories, so touching, covered a wide range of professions. The descriptions were brief yet succinct. Smithsonian curator, Dr. Masum Momaya has done an incredibly creative and attractive presentation that is bound to make Indian Americans who live here, both humble and proud at the same time. Museum Curator, Eric Stanley , Volunteer Coordinator Cynthia Leung and staff have enhanced the Smithsonian exhibits with entries in the form of displays and educational presentations of local origin. Exhibit will be there until Jan 10 2016.< /Text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>This charming history museum is far superior to most small city history museums, both in scope and in presentation.  Most history museums are static.  Once you've been there you never need to go again.  Most tell the story (however well they tell it varies widely) of a particular town or city, often chronologically, hitting the highlights...and that's it.  Not Sonoma County History Museum.  This museum covers a wide cultural scope, including the entirety of Sonoma County.  The shows and exhibits change 3 or 4 times a year, so there is always a reason to go back, and then back again.  Sonoma County has a rich history, from pre-European times to present day.  Eric Stanley, the museum's curator and major driving force, is not just knowledgeable, but creative, and presents each show with verve and a deft hand.

The present show, which ends July 9,  explores  "the Great War" at it's 100th anniversary, with a boffo major private collection of iconic WWI posters, plus some artifacts and letters from Sonoma County to cement the local connection.  The museum also includes lectures on various show topics, including, for the current show, the tragic story of the Spanish Flu, which overlapped with and was partially spread by soldiers in WWI.

Past shows have included the story of Russians who long ago settled Sonoma County's coast; the history and legacy of Chinese immigrants;  a  the history of the bicycle;  a touching and surprising show about Santa Rosa's Korean sister city, Jeju; an exhibit last year about guitars through the ages, called Medieval to Metal, showcasing fabulous instruments owned by famous musicians you know and loved.

The next upcoming show is about the history of the horse in Sonoma County.  Based on the shows that have come before, I'll be first in line for this one.  AND there is a bonus.  If you buy a ticket to a show at the History Museum (in a lovely 1910 building, formerly a Post Office), you also get admission to the new Sonoma County Museum of Art, which is right next door.  Plus there is a cool sculpture garden to tour.  What a deal!  What a treasure for Santa Rosa and Sonoma County.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The inspection of both our Heating and Air-conditioning units was professional and thorough. The functionality of both systems along with specific components were expertly described and explained. We were then given repair options with a lively discussion, questions, and clearly understood responses. The Dual Run Capacitor was replaced and we added the Start Capacitor and Relay kit to improve and safeguard the Fan unit over time. We also requested the installation of a Honeywell t4 1h 1c thermostat giving us the ability to preprogram heating and air conditioning cycles. From beginning to end, the Lucky Air Inc. visit was a pleasant and educational experience. Christian and Kathryn were professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and sincere. We will definitely see them yearly.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Noah is great! Very polite, professional and most importantly HONEST. He explained what was wrong with the ac and what needed to be done. And since we signed up for maintenance membership with their company, today’s job was free!  I’m glad we found Lucky Air Inc. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!< /Review>

<text>Our AC stopped cooling  and so we gave Lucky Air a call.  Chris came out to trouble shoot our system and diagnosed that the issue was due to a bad run capacitor. I should have listened to him a couple of months ago when he performed maintenance on our AC and he recommended an electrical overhaul for our aging compressor.  I loved that he took the time to explain the technical aspects of the repair. In the future,  I won't hesitate following Lucky Air's recommendations!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

My system was installed correctly but there was a problem with the unit itself. It was making a howling noise but Lucky worked to get the issue resolved. They even called in the brand's technician. The resolution took awhile to resolve but Lucky Air kept me informed throughout the process and I can't say enough about Phil. He was sent out originally to determine the cause of the howling. He's very knowledgeable and goes over and beyond. You can tell he likes what he's doing. I was originally undecided if I was going to use Lucky for ongoing maintenance but I decided that  I cannot get better dedication to customer service than what I've received since the original install.< /review>

Christian did a great job of meeting our expectations and is very polite. He walked us through the steps that we need to take to test our Central A/C system and told us what to expect for next time when they come back and diagnose where the leak is. I’m glad Lucky Air, Inc. is in my area because they are very upfront and trustworthy. Thanks for your help, Christian!<//text>

<review>Have used the A/C for the past three year without delay or issues.   After first maintenance service performed by Lucky Air, my A/C has stop performancing as brillant and dependable as it was prior to Lucky Air touching it.   Now, it doesn't turn on.</review>< pictures>

<review>I was approached by a very professional, respectful person at Lowe’s who was offering half price on a cleaning and tuneup of my AC; emphasizing annual tuneups help the AC system run at peak performance and increase the life of the system. During the conversation I agreed to receive an “free diagnostic inspection” of the AC system on top of the cleaning/tuneup. When the technician came out all they did is charge me for a quote, recommending further, much more expensive service and did not clean, nor service my AC.

It was my understanding a cleaning and tuneup was what I was paying for, not a quote to repair a AC system that currently works well and quickly cools my house.

Part of the quote was to clean my air ducts, which were recently cleaned.

I believe the gentleman at Lowe’s had good intentions, but very disappointed in the lack of service.</review>< Pics>

I highly recommend this company and their staff I don't believe that you should have any problem with them if there is a problem they are right there for you to call to ask questions. Excellent, professional, on time. It just so happens that I had just got through dealing with another company that was not like this month. Here on time kept the safe 6 feet away from us put on little booties to come into the house. And most important that they did not charge me before arms and my legs between you to work that had to be done.

Michael Melton technician lucky air Incorporated
Was my technician and it was a pleasure to have this person work on my air conditioning unit. From the start he showed up on time treated as professionally. And he showed us every part everything everything was checking he was talking to me let me know what he was doing and why he was doing it which is a great important to me.  No runaround talk no BS straight to the point but professional which is something that likes in the most companies nowadays they just come here and try to take your money and that's it Michael was not that person his company was not that company between making the appointment and the Time Michael came out that was at least a phone call or text message from that company letting me know what time he would be here and then they got down to last 10 minutes that he would be here at my house it was quite impressive that I knew exactly when Michael was going to be here and the fact that I was constantly reminded that there was an appointment for this day and to make everything ready for them. although I am old now and wanted to help Michael said no he has this and took care of it did everything to get up to my roof air conditioner he was safe didn't mess with anything up there I didn't break anything I mean he was constant professional he actually told me he was going to make sure he step over my gutter to step onto the roof to get to my air conditioning. Most companies just would have broke my guttered and blamed it that was my fault. The transaction the time the speed he was constantly moving constantly asking permission before he touched anything and he act gloves on he had booties on I'm surprised you didn't have a hearing that on but he was a great impression of the Lucky Air & heating Company out of Corona.  Also told me the company worked on water heaters he didn't but their company did which is always good to know what is something goes wrong who to call and try to get everything done at one company in fact have a comfortable relationship is a great thing to have being on a fixed income.  our safety was the most important part of his visit he want to make sure that we were safe and he was safe and these trying time to covid-19 that is greatly greatly appreciated.  I cannot tell you how much I was pleased by the company about their constant contact and their estimated time of his arrival.  emailed me the bill of everything that you did and plus sent pictures of everything you took pictures of why I was on the roof.will be doing business again with him another 6 months and they will take over to contracts for our heater and air conditioning units for this house. Michael was a pleasure to work with and he said he would be my tech as long as I have this house and since I'm not going anywhere he'll be my tech. And with any luck he'll be yours too. It's just funny that this should happen on St Patrick's Day I was wearing my lucky green t-shirt.

Great system, good service.  I went with the heat pump and the humidity in the house went up from 30-42%.  No more waking up with a parched throat.  It’s very quiet, inside and out.  The techs were very courteous and professional.   I love my new system!</text>

<text>Lucky air was the right choice for our HVAC needs. First they are great educators.  They didn’t just talk they showed us what was wrong and explained what was right.  I was walked through our HVAC system.  We were shown major safety issues that we were not aware even existed in our attic.  When it was time to make a decision about what was best for our family we were empowered to make an educated decision.  So much respect for Chris,Randi, Jerry, Erwin, and Cory.  These guys put in long hours and did everything they said they would.  I would say I am so glad I chose Lucky Air.  Thanks and I’m comfortable.

Installed a whole new change out of air and heating.  It was a pleasure to have Jerry, Brian, & Irvin in my home they worked hard on a very hot day. All the while they were very polite, respectful of me and my home.  They did a fantastic job! My air was up and running in a day! I would also like to mention Noah who  sold me my system another respectful nice young man.  Thank you!< /text>

My first experience with Lucky Air Inc. was when I needed a new heating system. I was very satisfied with the product installed and the manner with which I was taken care of. Now, today, I needed their services again with my A/C system. I was able to get an extremely quick service date and the service happened efficiently. Jacinda, in the customer service department, is always professional and friendly in taking care of my requests. The technician, Noah, is always on time, neat in appearance, knowledgeable about his work and explained what is being done and what may need to be done in the future. I asked so many questions and he took his good time to explain in detail so I understood. The company never tried to up-sell me. I am an elder lady and this means a lot to me. I recommend this company very highly. Jacinda will certainly take care of your customer service needs and ask for Noah, if possible, for your technician. You won’t be disappointed with this company one bit.< /Text>

Such a change to see a progressive company that thinks women in home improvement stores are so capable that they don’t need help..... that has to be the reason why the rep at Lowe’s blatantly ignored ALL female customers while bending over backwards to help the male shoppers.
I value your reps like you value females..... 0< /Review>

EXCELLENT!!! Company. They were honest knowledgeable technicians. We have a large a/c unit at our business that stopped cooling. I called Lucky air and they had there guy come out the very next day. He diagnosed the problem and solved it. Not only did they solve my issue they were very reasonable priced. A year ago we used a company we care heating and air and the experience was not enjoyable to say the least. I highly recommend "Lucky Air"<//text>

<Review>AC Failed on the first hot day of 2020. Lucky Air was able to book the appointment quick. Technician arrived on time while providing timely updates. Performed the work, but AC did not function well. Came back, made the necessary repairs all within the original quote. There was minimal pressure on up-sale. This is my second encounter with Lucky Air. Experience is great, they are very responsive and professional every time. I will definitely call Luck Air again when needed.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>After going through several HVAC contractors and having bad experiences, glad we found Lucky Air.  Have had Lucky Air now for 10 years ever since they installed two new HVAC systems for us (upstairs, downstairs).  Overall very happy.  They definitely stand out among HAVC contractors.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dcb20b957d5cc1:0xb56300bbe923ef89< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

Very  professional. My plumber  was just  so experienced.  I'm  a 66 yr old woman.  He explained  to step by step  what was going to occur  before hand. Not only that KOLIN was is name.he called me back into the kitchen  to show me what he was doing.  Sinks were clogged, faucets we're  dripping<//review>

Randi came over and did the maintenance cleaning. He did a thorough job and even did more than required when he put some insulation on that was missing. Very friendly and hardworking, and I feel like I can trust this company— which is worth a lot to me. Thanks</review>

Service call didn’t find a problem with my AC. Leak on my ceiling is not related to the unit on the roof. Noah was the technician, was very professional. He was part of the team to work in another call to replace gas water heater back in February 2020.
Very happy with the prompt response at both service calls. Water heater has been working great.< /text>

I called up lucky air and Tim Burk showed up and educated us didn’t sell us about an hvac system. After 2.5 hours of discussion and viewing their install  procedures we decided to go with lucky air.  Price was more than competitive and install was perfect. Thanks 😊👍</Text>

<text>Lucky Air came out to service our Ac & Furnace and we are very pleased! Our service tech Tanner was very kind and helpful and the customer service from the office was also really great. They were able to come out within the same week that we called to schedule. They offer a great membership for ac/furnace/plumbing and water heater which has amazing value, we are now happy members with Lucky Air! I definitely recommend this company for your home services.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I’m going to keep this short, but both Noah and Collin represented this business very well. The integrity and kindness they portrayed was above and beyond what I experienced from other contractors. They were very patient with my questions and more than willing to educate me without jargon, (which is tough to do in my opinion, when you’re dealing with the ins and outs of home equipment/water/electrical/piping etc.) I was truly blessed to have this company assist me when they did. I feel more empowered to keep my home up to date, especially because I know There’s a company out there called Lucky Air Inc who will be readily available to help! I am a very very happy costumer. Look, I said I would keep it short and look at me haha... oh well, they are worth every word!
Thanks again guys, see you in a few months for maintenance!< /Text>< pics>

<text>The tech, Michael was very polite and respectful. He carefully explained everything as he completed the inspection. He made a minor repair to get some cooling while his office arranges a specialist to come and explore options.
The next day while the arrival was delayed, the comfort specialist Randi was excellent.<//text>< pictures>

Called Wednesday, after hours, for repair. Was called back at 8 PM and given several options explained in detail. A proposal was emailed the next morning. I was originally scheduled for Friday at 1PM. They showed up at 9 and had my new AC woking in 2 hours. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Text>I now have heat! Yay! I can't say enough great things about these two service techs.
I called for heater service, they did a once around and showed me things that could be potentially risky to leave not taken care of. So they will have the office call to arrange a second visit. They BOTH were very informative without being pushy. Also extremely respectful and very knowledgeable too! I was in fear of it going to be very pricey due to the time and I kept telling them of more things that needed to be done! They fixed my water heater as well as my furnace and I signed up for a maintenance service plan and still paid a very comfortable amount considering these nice guys time! Thanks Guys, I most definitely will ask for you again next time.<//Text>< Time>

Very professional and very informative,  didn't try to upsell on things I didn't need. I have years of experience in the field. I'm up in years now cant do the work myself so I appreciate the young man that was honest and hardworking. I joined the yearly service plan, for a few bucks more than a service visit, I'll have few items serviced throughout the year. I couldn't beat that price or peace of mind.< /Review>

We've been working with Cory Graychik , Lucky Air HVAC technician, on our project.  Cory is very professional, hard and fast working and a pleasure to have on site.  Lucky Air is super easy to engage with, schedule, change schedule (whoops) and complete the work.  Super impressed, great technician, great company!

<text>Great service.  Both Michael Melton and Noah Fiero (spelling?) were great. Very friendly and both went above and beyond the job they were sent out for. Noah installed our new thermostats for us and Michael helped to temporarily seal a small leak that was found coming from the roof while inspecting the heater system in the attack.  Would recommend either one of them and the company as well. Prompt service and knowledgeable staff.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Michael Melton performed an A/C Tune Up. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable.  He showed me the areas of concern and was very descriptive in his explanation of why it was a concern. Michael worked up estimates, but allowed me to decide what worked best for me with no pressure on his part. He went way above the norm to fix my antiquated filter unit. I will not hesitate to call Lucky Air for any services required on my HVAC and highly recommend them.</Text>

This an OK company to go for your AC and Heating service. Consumer service is fair but it needs improvement. As far as warranty their work, I had an issue with my full cut in AC installment that they did at my house. It took a lot of back and forth for them to get it done. Even at that I had to compromise on putting insulation on my attic which cost $1500 so they can come out and follow up with warranty because they said they would not go for free. It was either that or pay extra for something that it should have been done when they did the whole job.  Other wise they wanted a Release of Liability on a 25k job that was done a year ago that still is on a 3 year warranty. If your willing to go back and forth for something that you paid for I recommend this company.  Pricing is good compare to other companies. Workers are great.<//Review>

GREAT AND TIMELY SERVICE
I called Lucky Air  to get a comparable quote and evaluation for work needed.  When the lucky Air  contractor came out , he was extremely professional and evaluated the situation and gave me an honest quote which was actually thousands of dollars under what the previous company evaluator gave . Lucky Air  did a very thorough and complete job with a professional friendly manner. I really appreciate the integrity demonstrated by this company and the efficient and friendly provision of services. I highly recommend Lucky Air! 👍< /Review>

<Text>My heater recently started making a loud hum. So I scheduled a service call with Lucky Air. First problem, The technician that came out only had a 7 foot ladder to get on my roof. So, After he just about fell off, he asked if I had a brick or something so he could prop one of the legs of his ladder up with, I asked that he not use his ladder and brought out my extension ladder for him to use. After he ran around my house with a thermometer for a while, it became apparent that he had NO CLUE as to what was causing the hum and told me that my heater/AC unit was very old. (It was installed in 2007)  He then spent another 20 minutes trying to sell me an additional $700 worth of unnecessary stuff like a maintenance contract, a start up kit and and couple other items that were not going to resolve the problem for which he was here for in the first place. I was told  that my service call would be $49. But, when he was finished writing up my invoice, it turned into a $121. He wanted an additional 1/2 hour labor. Remember, He did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to resolve the problem for which he was here for in the first place. In fact, I had to run out to his truck before he drove off and asked him to come back in and explain why the lights were now flashing on my thermostat. He didn't even have the courtesy to take the ladder down that I let him use. I might as well have just thrown $121 out the window. I DO  NOT RECOMMEND this company!<//Text>< Rating>

<Review>They sold central air units to 3 of my neighbors and they didn’t explain anything about the products they sold, and they were gone as soon as they cashed the check, they were unprofessional and rude, when they were asked to come over and take a look at why the top of the line Lennox wasn’t working and when they did come out for the call they said it was broken and they neede 2500$ to fix a unit not more than a few years old, and they have sand bagged their responsibility to the customer and now they have abandoned their customer in a pandemic, and a heat wave, it’s better to sweat it out because they are not going to get you air conditioning they are just going to take the money from you if you are elderly.</Review><date>1588025974795< /date>< Resp>

<text>I paid $69 for a service call only to be told after the repair technician had looked at my fire place  "we normally do not repair gas fire places." I am not sure why I was not told this prior to the service call; If I had known this information I would have selected a different repair company that specifically dealt with gas fire place repairs. I do want to say the technician who came out to our home was polite and professional. I ordered the broken part on line, as suggested by the technician. I then called management to see, upon arrival of the part, would they be willing to send the repair technician out again to install the part without a service charge and the answer was "no." I was told it would require an additional service fee of $69 and labor to install the part.  I was quoted an additional $150 plus the service fee to install the part. I had prior knowledge of the cost of the part which was $57 and was told the part in question could cost hundreds of dollars; the manager I talked to did not know I had already order the part.  That was my experience with this repair company.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Buyer beware!!!  This company prays on the unsuspecting consumer!!  The job they did at my home had various code violations along with gas and carbon monoxide leaks bellowing into my home!!  Just because your a/c and heater turn on doesn’t mean they are installed properly, lucky air will cut every corner possible and put your family in real danger!  The worst part of all is they only give you a 1 year warranty on parts and labor, how are you supposed to know if your unit is installed properly? If you knew enough to properly inspect the unit you probably would have done the work yourself.  The gas company and another contractor let me know about all of the issues with lucky airs install, I contacted the owner mike and basically told me to shove off!  I called a bigger and more reputable company to clean up the mess that lucky air made of my home, which cost me a additional 1600 dollars. I’m over 7000 dollars into my a/c and heating unit thanks to lucky air. Don’t make the same mistake I made, call someone else. Lucky air will turn your a/c and heating needs into a nightmare. It would be interesting to see a professional inspector go around to some of the job sites luck air has worked on, just to see what they come up with. I can almost guarantee they will find illegal code violations at every one. Don’t take my word for it, if you have gotten work done from them get it checked out soon, before your house catches on fire.< /Text>

<Review>After acquiring multiple bids for my project, I narrowed it down to two contractors, I chose Lucky Air because not only did they offer great price, but they offered an energy saving packaged upgrade to my home. I trusted them with the project and they did not disappoint. I am thoroughly impressed with the entire team at Lucky Air and the top notch Lennox equipment that they installed.< /Review><name>Ashish Sinha<//name></record></dataset><record>

Talked to Mike on Saturday and promised that one of his technicians will come on Monday between 2-4 pm. Tech never showed up. Did not even have the courtesy to call to let me know that they were not going to come. Later called the company and a lady picked up the phone. No apologizes at all - just reasons why they did not show up. If you do business with these guys, expect they may not show up and not even have the courtesy to let you know ahead of time.</review>

<GmapID>0x80dcb20b957d5cc1:0xb56300bbe923ef89< /GmapID><Review>Our system was about 30 years old and very expensive to run. I called Lennox and they recommended Lucky Air. We had other estimates, some well known companies and Lucky Air was the only company I felt confident in to the the job! They gave me the Best Estimate which included the Top of the line Lennox System. Lucky Air offered other things already included in their package, the other companies did not! The other companies wanted to charge the same price for a less efficient system.
We had new Duct work and the whole system redone. The Nate certified installers did an awesome job!!! I am so glad we found Lucky Air and would highly recommend them to anyone!!!<//Review>< date>

Best price, best service, best install. I got 4 quotes for a new Lennox A/C - furnace system. Lucky Air's price was almost $2,000 less. The entire process from the estimate with Mike, to the install with Enrique and Mitch was very professional. During the 2 day install, both Mike (owner) and Jason (foreman) would stop by and ensure that everything was going okay.
My husband wanted a 4 ton A/C installed, Mike talked us out of it. He said a 3 ton was sufficient to cool our home and getting the bigger unit would be more expensive and cost more too run. He was right, very happy with our Lennox 3 ton XC20. Love his honesty, he could of easily charged us more. I would highly recommend Lucky Air, great company!</Review>

< Review>
After shopping around, Lucky Air was the company I selected to do a total replacement of my HVAC and duct work.  The one thing I liked about the company is their attention to detail and getting the system to perform at its peak performance.  Michael the owner was very kind to throw in an upgrade with the return filter at no charge, due to my daughter's allergies.  The installation took 2 days and I have to say that they are very respectful to your house.  The workers were very polite and appeared to have an upbeat attitude.  The system selected for me was a Lennox and I have to say it is very quiet which I truly enjoy; I never heard a system so quiet as the Lennox.  Thank you Michael for all you done for my family!<//Review>

<Review>Our AC went out during some of the hottest days recently.  Could not find anyone who had time to come out and look at the unit.  Until I called LuckyAir.  They were able to get me in the next day and were able to correct the issue in no time.  Michael was friendly and very knowledgable and gave us several options for correcting the issue.  We have found a new goto for issues with out AC/Heater. Thanks Michael and LuckyAir!!</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1499804980779</Time>< Name>

< Review>
Our air conditioner was in desperate need of repair last summer, but we weren't quite in the market to purchase a new unit. Mike Brady, the owner of Lucky Air came out promptly on a Sunday, during one of the hottest days of the year. He replaced/repaired a few items to get our family through the blazing heat and helped hold our household over until we were ready to purchase a replacement unit.

After months of extensive research and many informative emails and phone calls back and forth to Mike, we decided on the Lennox XC-25 Air Conditioner. We also purchased a SLP98V furnace to replace our outdated one.

I can't say enough great things about both units. They are so quiet compared to the old ones! The variable level cooling of the XC-25 ensures that every room is cooled to perfection. I was really excited about the ability to control the unit through my cell phone too; such an incredibly convenient feature that was much easier to use than I had initially anticipated. I can't wait to compare my energy bills this summer!

The installation duo from Lucky Air were very professional and personable; they arrived promptly and finished the job in a timely manner. I was especially impressed with the condition in which they left the area, everything was very tidy, no loose ends! I was pleasantly surprised when I received an unexpected follow up call from Mike a few days after the install. This team knows their trade and they manage to accomplish their work with a level of honesty and integrity rarely seen these days.

Bravo to the group of professionals at Lucky Air, my hat is tipped to you. My family and I thank you for keeping us comfortable. I'll definitely recommend this company to my family and friends.< /Review>

<Review>Mike Brady & his great team; Patrick, Jason and Rudy, just completed the installation of our new Lennox EL195E & 14ACX Heater and Air Conditioner and we couldn't be happier with their excellent service and our new system. They also replaced all the ductwork and registers.  Lucky Air, Inc came to our rescue on one of summer's hottest days last year when our old system failed.  We had no doubts that we would buy our new system from them because of their fair pricing, prompt service and excellent reputation. They are always on time, clean up all areas after their work is completed and are respectful and courteous.  Patrick, our service tech, is available by cell phone should we have any questions or concerns. Ashley & Molly, the office staff, are equally courteous and respectful.  We are blessed to have an HVAC company we can trust and highly recommend them for all your HVAC needs.

The beach is fantastic during low tide. It is notorious for containing multiple tide pools, as well as rocky beaches and rocks to climb. Wildlife as always is present, and you can get some fantastic pictures here. Parking and restrooms are, not a problem in this area, as they're both nearby. This is a fantastic place for pictures, as it provides interesting rock formations. If you can, climb up the big rock that's located on the north-western point of the beach, and you will get some fantastic shots of the scenery. Coming here during high-tide is not advised, as none of the things mentioned above are accessible due to the high water level. All in all, a great place to come especially if you're in the area.< /Review>< resp>

I was visited this beach on July/10/20.
It is small beach but it is perfect for all ages.
It has everything I’m looking for.
There is no parking fee, and street parking too.
It has a basic bathroom, no sink, but its clean when I was there.
It is breathtaking and fun place.
All little and big rocks come with different colors and shapes, they are very pretty.
If you like to collect rocks, this is the beach for you to find your favor.
It has few little caves, interesting rock formations, cliffs for me to hop back and forth very fun, and a huge adventure rock to climb up to enjoy the view of the Pacific Ocean.
I definitely will come back here again.< /text>

Beautiful and fun place. Very basic bathroom. No sink. All the rocks here were beautifully sanded down by the waves crashing into the Ricky mountains by the beach. Love this place! We plan to come here again in the future</Review>

Neat cove with some unique rock formations. The beach is more rocky than sandy but a good place to hike or picnic for the day. There are restrooms but no washing facilities just the bare essentials. About 20 minutes south of Morro Bay along some winding narrow but well kept roads.<//Text>

Phenomenal. Such a nice small beach with great picture opportunities. I found an abalone shell, intact and a lobster tail. Such cool findings and nice slow walking. There are bathrooms here, but it's basically a port a potty with a real building. No water to wash your hands with either. Plenty of parking. DON'T FORGET YOUR CAMERA!<//review>

Beautiful cove. Rock formations are so cool. Sand is much coarser than typical. I think it is the only spot in Montana de Oro State Park that dogs are welcome.<//Review>

So beautiful. Every corner is different and spectacular even in the minutiae of different textures on the ground. Highly recommend also hiking to the cliff top next to the cove for even more beautiful views<//review>

<Text>One of our favorite places on the central coast, just south of Moro Bay. Above the cove is a small museum of the history of the once cattle ranch and behind that a small camping area I would take the kids in the summer for a getaway from the heat in Bakersfield.</Text>< Pics>

<gmap_id>0x80ece2a59aa8b0b7:0x72acfa44627e63b1</gmap_id><Review>Beautiful Spooner’s Cove is located in Montaña de Oro State Park.   During the spring months there is a lovely lagoon.  The sea is very rough and swimming is not recommended.   Very busy on weekends and holidays.  Parking is limited.  Dogs may be on the beach but must be leashed.</Review>< resp>

A great pebble/rock beach. Very scenic. Tide pools are fun if you have GOOD shoes. You can get your feet wet, but the rocks make it more dangerous for swimming. (Go to Morro Rock or Avila Beach for swimming.)< /Text>

A nice cove and beach that is great for families. The cove is surrounded by high sea cliffs and offers a serene setting. Well worth a visit and a great place to relax.</Text>

First time here. Definitely a must see. Very pretty sites, clean. It was a bit crowded for parking and the road to get there was very narrow.  But my family and I enjoyed our time.  We will definitely come back.<//Review>

<Review>Spooner's Cove is a secluded rocky cove on the Pacific coast of the California Central Coast, sheltered by cliffs with tide pools. Perfect for avoiding crowds in these times. The layered rock I believe is ancient sedimentary ocean floor deposits< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Beautiful place to experience the power of the ocean by watching the waves crash into the rocky coast. If you like to collect rocks and shells, you could sit for hours and find some interesting pieces. Lots of small chunks of jade can be found if you look hard enough. A curvy road to get there but a must visit place  if you are in the area.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><response>None</response>< username>

Beautiful beach and good for the kids to walk around. We went down a cove and skipped rocks. Bring enough water. They even have some restrooms along the way.<//review>

This beach is more pebles than sand but it was a lovely place to have a picnic and watch the waves. There were family's with pets. It didn't detract from the ambiance for me but I suppose it could if children or dogs annoy you. I would recommend wearing tennis shoes the pebles hurt to walk on and there are some nice big rocks to clime on but I didn't feel safe doing so in flip flops.<//Review>

Spooner's Cove is a great little beach that gives you access to the bluff trail and some really nice ocean scenery. We could watch the waves and sea lions all day, very beautiful area.<//review>

<text>This to me is a hidden gem, the beach is a rock beach, meaning it's mostly ground up shale rock and other ocean things.  It's not Rocky or in comfortable to walk on bare foot.  The cove isn't really for boogie boarding or surfing.  My family and I love the trails and beautiful views.  Also, go see the historical shop above the cove.< /text><gmapID>0x80ece2a59aa8b0b7:0x72acfa44627e63b1< /gmapID><user_id>110969862553492167450<//user_id>< Pictures>

Beautiful! It's not a sandy beach, it's more pebble-like. A bit of a drive and limited cell service, but worth it for the view and tranquility. Also, be aware that the restroom is more of an outhouse, but it's something!< /Text>

<review>This stretch of beach will always have a special place in my heart. During early morning hours and most weekdays it's a delight to visit, but on weekends and holiday seasons it's absolutely chaotic. There are always a few strange characters wondering Spooner's as well, so do be aware of your surroundings.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Love this place. It's beautiful and peaceful. The walking trails along the bluffs offer wonderful views. The campground is basic with pit toilets and shorter parking pads at the sites which limits accessibility by larger RVs. There is a restored ranch house that offers tours and has a small nature store (no groceries). The aggressive racoons can be a problem.< /Text>

The beautiful, small cove with rocky shoreline has a quaint old fashioned feel to it. Its  small creek and hillside with Monterey Pines add a protected natural environment to relax and enjoy it's natural wonders. Definitely a place to return to.<//Review>
