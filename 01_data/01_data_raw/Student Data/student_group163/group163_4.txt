Rich creamy and flavorful ice-cream. I had my first ice-cream here when I was there for the movies. Now I make the long trip just to taste this goodness! It's a gem of a find in the bay.<//Review>

So sad that this wonderful sweets shop will close forever on October 5, 2020. So many tasty treats and ice creams. Last day to enjoy is 10/4/2020. Thank you for everything Charlotte's Ice Cream!< /review>

We were passing through Hayward after having moved away ten years ago. I don't remember this place during my college days. It's a quaint, fun, fairly relaxing spot on B Street. Small and cozy, but plenty of seating for our party of eight. We got mostly scooped ice cream, which was good. I had an Oreo malted and it was delicious. The hot dogs were really good too. Price is fair.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x808f93d845857fd5:0x6563958f1e837991<//gmap_id><UserId.>113792817830675611277< /UserId.>< response>

Delicious cupcakes, I’ve tried 4 different flavors so far and each one had been moist. The chocolate covered strawberries are 👌 and my son loves the ice cream. They have a variety of sweets. I’m hooked on this place. Happy to have found this spot.<//text>

Excellent customer service and goodies. Dining area always clean and attractive. I would go more if prices weren't so high.  Not saying their items aren't worth it, just that I am low income.<//Text>

<Text>This place was awesome! Stopped in today for my first time and the selection of desserts and candies were awesome! I selected a Bavarian filled pastry. The woman inside  (I believe was the owner) insisted on making me one fresh although the other looked perfectly fine! It was absolutely amazing. Kudos to the service and dedication to the quality!< /Text>< time>

<review>A hidden little gem right near the theatres. Panini were quite good for an ice cream and candy spot. People were so nice...quality of ice cream was way above average. Bit pricey, but worth having a special small business to enjoy. Even bought my sis a gift certificate. Go there.</review>< user_id>

This place is packed with all kinds of freshly made sweets! I came here for dessert after lunch and ordered a hot fudge sundae. My sundae tasted outstanding and rich in flavor. They have a ton of different desserts like cakes and fudge and a ton of other things. If you have a sweet tooth, this place will definitely have something for your fix.< /Review>

Great family-owned, family-friendly confectionery. With roots in Hayward and Castro Valley you will walk down memory lane when you see the pictures of Hayward/Castro Vally's past. Lots of character in the decor and above all else the ice cream and sweets taste amazing. Friendly staff and convenient point of sales checkout that accepts Google Pay. I highly recommend you take a visit.< /Text>

Some of the best ice cream i've had, both in flavours and taste. Very friendly staff who make you feel welcome. Take my friends there often and enjoy the great selection of sweets. They don't skimp out on ice cream scoops either, large helpings.

Highly recommend a visit!<//Text>

When I asked the waitress, she said cook ran out of shrimp.  No apology of any kind.  Also wanted fresh strawberry pie, but didn't have it😢  Also there were loud group of about 6 people and I could not hear my date sitting in front of me to chat.<//text>< pics>

The ice cream here is delicious! They have the classics as well as some fun flavors. My husband's favorite is a scoop of vanilla with a scoop of licorice. I usually get the green tea or pistachio.< /Review>

<text>Every time we’re downtown, we stop at this place. We love the selection of chocolates and cakes. We would go for the ice cream if we weren’t lactose intolerant (a condition that affects 1/3 of American adults; you’d think more businesses would be clued in by now). One or two non-dairy selections would have us spending more money here.

Sadly, we are frequently disappointed by the lack of selection in fudge. Several times we’ve gone there specifically to buy the Butterscotch fudge (or the coffee butter scotch fudge), both of which are AMAZING, and neither were on offer; only Chocolate and Rocky Road.

We want this business to succeed, but how can they maintain a loyal customer base if they don’t carry products loyal customers want to buy?<//text><Rate>3<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>Wonderful customer service, cute cafe, old photos of Hayward, and a variety of treats for whatever you are craving. If you've never been there before it will take you a good 5 minutes to check out all they have to offer.

Fudge, ice cream, brownies, mochi, salt water taffy, peanut brittle, assortment of cakes and cookies and more.<//review>< time>

Cakes, fudge, candies and ice creams for your sweet tooth, in an old fashioned shop. Wisely next door to a 70s, 80's arcade<//text>

<review>My favorite Goto place anytime of the day. Their ice creams are very creamy and not sweet, I love the pistachio👍🏼 The cakes are all a must try, carrot cake and the cannoli cream cake are my favorites so far. The shop is very cozy and it’s right in downtown Hayward.<//review><Date>1511966695512</Date>< UserId.>

<Text>Well manicured 27 hole executive course. Can be frustrating working with starters to play your preferred 9/18, but all are similar in quality. Good course for hitting every club in your bag.< /Text>< user>

Beautiful 27-hole layout. It's in excellent shape.  You can leave your driver at home if you wish - a 5 or 3 wood will set you up fine on the par 4s. The staff is very nice. The pro shop and amenities are pretty basic.  Fun course!< /Text>

Ok experience.  Pace of play was good for a Tuesday tee time at 12:20. Check in was efficient and quick.
However, the South course greens were being aerated and there was no advanced disclosure of this condition.  The green roll was therefore pretty poor. That should have been disclosed ahead of time.  Course fairways in East and South only fair.  No drinks for sale out on the course.  Snack bar was efficient.
Oaks North Island a fun (shorter) course for higher handicappers, not real challenging challenging intermediate and above players.< /text>

Great course for an old guy like me. 3 nines, Most holes 240 or less. Best greens I've see in many years. Kudos to the greens keepers< /Review>

My one gripe is the tee off boxes, after 50 years of use they are mostly egg shaped.  Fun time can be had with 3 hour rounds easily within reach.  I always walk here (well roll anyway).< /Text><userid>104079518815435016594</userid><GmapID>0x80dbf11f0cf52edb:0x2b13ca9808cd8a8<//GmapID>< response>

4.5 stars...Love this great executive course.  They have three different 9 hole courses to choose from when playing a full round.  Prices are affordable and staff is generally friendly and professional. They lost a half star because they failed to return my voicemail from the morning before my pm tee time when I was trying to verify availability of pull carts vs riding carts. Still, no complaints...and I will continue to come back.</Text>

<Review>Oaks North is a well maintained and fun Executive golf course for golfers of all experience levels.  The staff is very friendly.  The course is very popular, so book your tee times early to ensure you get the time you want.<//Review>< pics>

First time at Oaks North.  Really nice executive course.  Even on one of the hottest days in San Diego there was still a nice breeze whick kept it bearable.  Reasonable green fees and friendly staff.<//Text>

Fun place to play. Competitive prices. Short courses.
Nice place to get out and play a few rounds after work or to play single person.
Driving range has limited stalls but is nice.
Putting greens are good.
Relaxing courses.<//review>

Fun course to brush up on some golfing skills with buddies. Who brought the Bentley for crying out loud and the glow in the dark balls. Had a great time though. Hollar at those knuckle-heads too! Supreme golf course.</text>

The place is a mess. Went to the driving range yesterday, 10.00 for less than a large bucket of balls. Every shot is an up hill lie. The mats are all curled up and nasty. They need to be replaced. And there is a little tree right by the mats that is shedding its leaves and the leaves are everywhere. The balls are really bad, old and turning yellow and lots of lost regular balls mixed in. The least they could is buy some balls. They had lots of business but they will not get mine for a while.</review>

<review>There is no place better to play golf with your kids than Oaks North. Lloyd and the team run great programs, and make it comfortable for all levels of play. Don't be mistaken though, the holes are fun and challenging. You'll use every club in the bag. Kids, women, beginners and golfers of all ages - this is the place!< /review>< response>

< review>
I have played at Oaks North many many times.  Called today to book three people for Twilight and to play nine holes.  Time they gave was after 2:00pm and the cost was $50 per person with cart.
I told them in nice words to "SHOVE IT" no course is worth that much for nine holes.  Person who answered said that has been the price for a long time.  NO WAY played there less than a month ago and it was $33 for 18 holes with a cart.
I am also a JC member.</review>

This is a decent used bookstore, but you really need to look to find something good. There aren't many eye catching titles, it's more of an old timey place where you can find the long-forgotten, yellow-paged chapter books you would read back in elementary school.

There are some cool works dating back to 1930s, magic books, conspiracy, war, supernatural, children's books, and many many old romance novels. Their books are in an okay condition, but I think $7 + tax is too steep for their condition. However, they do have a lot of  discounted books for $1 on their sidewalk carts.

The service was good, the older gentleman at the counter was nice and was friendly. He asked if I needed help when I came in and rang me up when I picked out a book. Also, I saw a lady come in with a basket of books, as they also buy from the public. Gold star on that.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>This place seems super disorganized but it's just because it's crammed with books! They have a really great selection and all the shelves are labled well so even though it might seem overwhelming, it's pretty easy to find the genre you're looking for. They have a lot of older books that honestly would just look good on a shelf but are definitely worth the read! Little places like these are rare nowadays, so take advantage!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>A treasure of a place with friendly helpful staff. Vintage magazines & books at fair prices. I always find a few books of interest in the clearance sale out front. Plan to spend at least 20 minutes looking. A great place to donate your old books to.< /Review>< pictures>

Went looking for a specific title and they knew exactly where it was and led me right to it. It's a great place if you just want to browse. Good prices, especially since a lot of the books are old and unique. Both fiction and non-fiction.</review>

I buy books here often. They have a good selection (they have a lot of books!) and it's a nice place to go and browse and take your time.</review>

Don’t go here because your force to sign a waiver in case they mess up because it’s not their responsibility if like you get fungus or anything they are not responsible and your force to sign it before they start doing your nails. I wouldn’t recommend< /review>

You can't expect to get the best when you just driving around and stop at any nail shop. I have been coming here for years now. Kinda had every nail lady do my nails. Up until 3 yrs ago that I came across YVONNE. She is Good, Gentle, Funny too, SHE'S MY GO TO Nail Lady. It's best to make appointment with her though. Thanks for this morning Yvonne 😍
UPDATE 6/20/20: OFFICIALLY OPEN. THANK YOU Yvonne for this Morning ❤❤❤. Oh I missed my nail Lady🤗< /text><UserId.>104200148256509396176< /UserId.>< user_name>

I’ve never had them tell me that in any other shop. When the ladies started doing my nails the other lady came and she said she was going to help her so it was uncomfortable for me. They did everything very fast and missed a spot I was shocked and very unsatisfied I’ve never been attended this bad. The lady also charged $2 for paying with card and asked for a tip after the horrible service and bad nails.</Text>< Date>

It was the first nail spa that I visited when I moved to California, and I don't think I'll go anywhere else. They are close to my job, and all of the places that I frequent, which makes them all the more convenient. I love this place and would highly recommend them to anyone.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I’ve been trying to grow them for a few weeks now, my nails grow fast but break easily if they don’t have gel on them. I came in with chipped, regular nail polish and asked for a Gel manicure.

First thing I noticed was, she did not ask me what type of shape I wanted. Just asked if she could cut them, I said no, file please.

Secondly, When she was cutting my cuticles, she proceeded to cut my nail edges as well! Never have I ever seen this done! I was not happy.

Thirdly, at one point of cutting cuticle. The lady suddenly changed the tool she had been using (which never left my sight from the time she started on me). I distinctly saw the clean tool move with her hand down to her box and then heard a clink, and saw a tool come up with cuticle still on it!! Yup, she went right to my nail without even bothering to clean it.
(I know I’m an idiot for staying there after that moment, but I really needed my nails to be  fixed)

Fourth, my nails hadn’t even gotten a single coat of polish on them when I was asked if I could pay in advance as the manager was going home and “wanted to close the register”. I said sure. They charged me $23 for a gel manicure + $2 for using a credit card. $25 for a gel manicure not including tip! I'm not sure if they upcharged me because of the time; they closed at 7:30 PM (I got there at 7:00).
Tell me why, later on, I see someone paying via credit card well after the manager left.

Fifth, I had to ask her to even out my nail lengths as she left one hand with lengths longer than the other.

Sixth, she left me with nail polish stuck to my fingers.

Needless to say, I will never be coming here again. I can only give one star since the lady took her time with my cuticles.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Great salon. The ladies always take good care of you. I always get compliments after Tina does my nails! Pedicures are great with Jenny and the sea salt scrub is the best.<//Review>

LILY does an awesome job on pedicures. All the girls do a good job, but Lily definitely takes her time to make sure her work is on point.< /text>

A small shop with heart. The staff is fantastic, and their work speaks volumes. No wine or snacks, but their work makes up for that.</Text>

This time I had them done because I was leaving on vacation. They did a horrible job. The polish in the nails was bumpy and just not smoothly applied and it wasn’t just one nail!😡. So disappointed.

I would never in my life recommend this place to anyone. If I would give zero stars I would. Horror work on nails and over priced and the nails get water underneath them on the first day of them being on. Also the lady who did my nails cut me and left my fingers sore. Never again</Review>

Ridiculously overpriced for the job they did. My pinky nail chipped ten minutes after I walked out of the salon. The salon and their products don't look very sanitized either. I would not recommend this place to anyone.<//Text>

Very friendly service!  Structurally I could still see the last restaurant "Midori" but was pleased that it has the energy of a different restaurant.  I'm really surprised that the place was almost empty seeing that the other sushi restaurants nearby all looked busy...  The prices were so low for good sushi.  We had saki bombs, and ate sushi until we were full and the total was 35$.</text>

They have an amazing deal right now for 3 specialty rolls, 6 pieces of sushi, and 3 appetizers all for $49.99. 100% worth it, will be back.</review>

<date>1515377948594<//date><Rate>3< /Rate><text>I liked it more when it was Minori. Now it has a happy hour with very good deal on beer, $3 a pint. Hand rolls are very worth it, fresh, big, and $4.5 during HH. The Oysters are 1 or 2$ during happy hour but they add sauce on top of them, not necessarily liked the 1$ ones. They are too big with not a good flavour. Carpaccio looks good. Sashimi was good but they put a lot of garlic on top of the fish which I don't necessarily love.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZAXML_v9n5WVKejIsxuDXsR1N9ebdDfMVd6_2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMWXR4tCJ03X6UbEtKUgjN7JCMhivIz1dhOA5Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9-wUjEtYs1ETpzw7_v1dkEBAF0qCopztjBQMB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoO-0tH-Ofvqvy4LjRAW5NrHk3dXel78z3U_GJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTs8oggsBH9M9GM7xR9NTJUHKSBnJnsMoN4Vlj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx27VN5Rl3YK_SzVRTVWdU95OlXBee5lAlFLkc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7F-ncd2OwAdSiTHweo7MPRRk7v6fKkuRIyp_q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi1PsYbGAYhluHPoBTUhV8bK_-l2aIMSKpKvAQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE7F-0_nlT4brYQxdVXeA2GNB5LOBMtAf8sXAg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc__jCQ1xWdjPXVPpssNLWmoQ7KTvRbqRCbTm0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN74xsy8UKRj5zdHQCJeaO6PD9vPl38_itc04j5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Very good sushi and excellent service. Good location. Definitely try the Clipper roll and shrimp tempura roll. Vegetables roll a little bland. Good beer on tap and sake.</Review>

<Review>Not a widely publicized place but what a lovely meal.  Sashimi was arranged like art. Fried and sauteed dishes were really delicious. Sunomo salad had just the amount of sweet and sour - not overpowering like in most restaurants.</Review><Rating>5< /Rating><gmapID>0x80c2be0e98a1c1ff:0xd526e3bbe00c930a<//gmapID>< pictures>

We had the most amazing dinner with Yo as our sushi chef. The sashimi was amazingly fresh and so very delicious. The servers were super courteous and efficient. I stayed there for a couple of hours and rolled out of there completely satisfied. Thank you Yo. I will see you again very soon.</review>

< review>
Tonchin was worth the wait.  The okonomiyaki was the fluffiest I've ever had.  The ramen was flavorful, but I wouldn't say it is more special than I have had elsewhere. I had the spicy tan tan ramen and it was made with tonsure broth and roasted pork.Do not leave without trying the okonomiyaki.  You will not be disappointed.</review>

Great food at an inexpensive price! I have used Ball Park pizza for many birthday party's and it has always had a good outcome with their huge field in the back and their arcade located in the restaurant. Overall deserving of a solid 5 star rating.< /Text>

This place is my preferred one. I visit many restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very chummy and the food they place on your table is so tasty. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent meal in this place. Highly recommended.</text>

< Review>
I used to be a regular at Ballpark years ago, and loved hanging out for Monday Night Football.  Never had a problem.  Then, after many years of living overseas,  I returned with family for a meal.  Horrible!!  Bad service from surly staff, and the pizza was a joke.  My kids, all hungry pizza lovers, couldn't even finish one slice. What a waste of time and money.  A huge disappointment.<//Review>

< review>
We were in San Juan Capistrano for a Soccer Game, I was allowed to make reservations for 40 people. The food was great, we ordered lots of pizza, pasta and we even had the salad bar. The girls enjoyed the ice cream. The service was quick and the staff was really nice. Gracias<//review>

It's a pretty hyped-up place, so I was skeptical. But the staff was great, the food was amazing, and the BYOB kept the prices low. Try this combo on your pizza: artichoke hearts, garlic and basil. So good! Also, the "desert cal zone" was really good. It had sweet ricotta inside, with Nutshell and powdered sugar on top.The wait for a table can be as long as four hours, but if we can get seated again with no wait...we'll be back!< /text>

The food wasn't the best however the atmosphere of the place was fun and perfect for a sports celebration. We got pizza for the team and it was fine, but only go to enjoy the atmosphere.< /Review>

We love ballpark pizza.   So much nostalgia from this kind of pizza joint when we were kids playing sports.   We also love their pizzas, salad bar, and garlic bread.   The staff are always the same and do a great job.   They have quite a few draft beers and pitchers.   Lots of TVs with all kinds of sports.   Sometimes mma fights which create lots of questions from our little girls... lol.   We also love that there is a golden spoon right around the corner to stop at after pizza.   Parking is easy as well.   We recently had an AYSO end of the year party and they were great with the planning and organization of that as well.</text>

<text>Their pizza would be better with more sauce.  They use almost no sauce. You can order extra sauce, but in my experience you'll only get it about half the time.  The reason might be that some chefs check for "extras" after they put on the cheese.  Then it's too late.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>This is probably the worst customer service I've encountered. Not only was placing an order a challenging process for the staff, having it confirmed seemed to be a complex issue. Arrived at the arraigned time of pick up and our pizzas were incomplete. When prompted for clarity as to why they were unprepared, we were met with resentment. We are long time residents in town, and  support local establishments, however next time we will utilize Costco.</review><UserId.>115741423480800850320</UserId.>< Rate>

Great pizzza, antipasto salad and beer.  Service is fast and friendly.   The cost is what I expected to pay and the ambiance was good for kids and sports enthusiasts.< /Text>

Good tasting pizza with a crispy bottem. We'll be back often. Only suggestion is to add a craft beer selection.

Other great think about this place is they play soccer games all the time. For sure a footie lovers place.</Text>

If you live in the area you have been here for a pizza party at least once.  Local beer on tap, with some well made standard pizza.  The arcade will keep the kids busy for an hour or two.< /text>

This pizza is the best in town. They need to add craft beer, but I'm happy with Stella Artois.</Text>

I had a conference in Long Beach that was held here and I thought it was a nice place. We were given a breakfast meal and lunch, not sure where the food came from. The Dumke Room looks like some sort of  senate meeting room. Everything looked clean.<//Text>

I think the Chancellor's office needs to look into the mismanagement of money at San Jose State University. We the students were notified on the local news this morning that spring classes are being cut. Apparently there is a deficit of $32 million dollars and next semester they will be overspending by $3.5 million dollars. We the students would like to see the financial records of San Jose State and demand that classes be left open for current students to enroll.< /Review>

I got a lavender/purple color and I have spots of red and blue sparkles on 7 out of 10 of my nails poor quality she didn’t even finish taking off my other nails before putting these ones on! I’m not happy with them at all. will never get dip powder here again.</text>< Pics>

Not good. Chose to go here after reading reviews. I don’t know I had a totally different experience. Just got a pedicure. Hot stone massage lasted 30 seconds. Scrub lasted 30 seconds. The pressure applied to scrub my feet was barely felt... therefore pointless. Massage lasted 3 minutes. Hot towel just used to wipe off the oil. I wasn’t even sure they were going to cut my cuticles. They did eventually. Not worth $40. Other patrons were just as short as mine.

They have plastic screens up but what’s the point when they wear their masks under their noses?? They appeared to use new supplies and plastic liners. But the overall place was dirty and falling apart.<//Text>

<Review>While I can say the professionalism was completely out the door my nails are perfect by Lei. I showed him a picture and he duplicated it perfectly. And not only that I got my toes done for my engagement party and they suggested gel nails because they last longer(for a small extra fee on sale). I just went in for a fill today (Over two weeks later) and my gel toes still look as perfect as when I left the salon. While the professionalism is lacking I will always go back. My only regret is that I’m moving out of state and I can’t take Lei with me.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1596686216571, 'text': 'Thank you for living us a great review.

<Review>I walked inside
There was no customers but the lady at desk had such an attitude like she was disgusted
She should be happy to get business
I was friendly asked for a menu or specials
I was having a great day,
thought I'd do something nice for myself but she whipped menu at me
Did not want to answer any questions
Really, kinda buzz killed my happy day
Bad vibes coming from her
I walked out
As I felt she had a horrible welcoming approach & made me very uncomfortable 😌<//Review><user_id>102198813231596309637< /user_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>I would not recommend this place at all. The guy in this place made me bleed while doing my acrylics and he did not shape them the way I asked after I told him many times what I wanted. They also ended up very Crooked and uneven. I have also heard the same complaints from others I know who have gone here.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>Went to get a gel dip fill and ended up with cheap uneven acryllic nails that are flat, uneven and different lengths. It was so rushed because the woman was doing 10 things at once. I wish it was a better experience but I won't be going back.<//text></record>

<text>Um so the guy doing my friends nails was watching tv on his phone and messing around on his phone while doing her acrylic nails and would stop doing her nails for a minute to mess around on his phone. Completely unprofessional. He would also snap at her whenever she didn’t hear him and he would have to repeat himself, because he was mumbling. He would raise his voice at her. And because he was watching tv while doing her nails he started to drill into her skin because he wasn’t paying attention. He also would dust his phone off after drilling and leave her hands covered in the nail dust.  Probably the weirdest experience we’ve ever had<//text>< pics>

Love Josh! and his wife is great with eyebrow waxing. Cheap regimens with good results. :Product stands out beyond similar businesses in the area. Downside: older building, not the cleanest facility... the actual footbaths and tools are clean, but the floors and paint etc are aged and could use sprucing.</review>

Honestly the worst manicure I've ever had. She was quick- wouldn't get all the dirt under my nails, even after asked. The polish is lumpy and there is peeled skin all around my nail.</text>

<Text>I went there for fill on my acrylic nails. The guy that was there was very sweet but did not seem to know what he was doing. He started trying to rip my nails off with a pair of nippers telling me I needed to have a new full set. But I actually didn't and he was hurting me as he pulled them off. Then use the Dremel tool to file them down super short. They're super crooked ones longer than all the rest. So I called and asked the same night if they could fix them the next day and I wanted gel polish not regular polish. She said she would but then when I called the next day she was not very friendly and did not seem to want to fix it and wanted to charge me 15 extra dollars after I already paid $23 for the fill  and the crappy nail polish.  Not worth the money.  Not sanitary. Ew.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1557219166376, 'text': 'Sorry for you not happy with previous owner, We take over and the shop name Bless nails and spa now'}<//resp><user_id>113261320755010190157<//user_id><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x809b7066092ff5b9:0x92751be43c9d6bbf</Gmap_id><rating>1</rating><time>1454034915289</time><name>Cristan SMitherines</name></record>

Mary is quick & doesn't do a good job on my mom. I've learned that they do a poor job at feet. But even worse job at your fingernails!

I have to add that my mom & I went to John and I don't know what he didn't do but both our nail polish started flaking off that week. That is not cool. They aren't that good! I wonder how much training they have had.<//text>

<review>Terrible - granted, he did not injure me. He spent the whole time chatting with the other staff and literally did not even LOOK at my feet while buffing my nails! Completely skipped the calluses on the tips of my toes. Not worth the price at all. They charge $25, it was worth $15.<//review></record>

My mother has been coming here for three years. She’s very happy with the results she’s been getting. She has a very sensitive body, and not any spa can treat her. However, here they were able to accommodate her problems and give her the best treatment. They are very professional and educated in their craft. She absolutely recommends this place to any who want to alleviate their pain and relax. This is easily the best place in Merced for massages, they are affordable and have the highest standards. They are consistent year in and year out, and again, She heavily recommend them.</Review>

<review>If I ever need a massage, I make my way to Oasis.  The masseuses are great and I always feel comfortable with them. Their front desk host is always nice, and from the various times that I have gone, they start promptly. On the other end, they tend to end five minutes early which can be a little annoying at times. Overall, this is a good place with good prices.<//review>< username>

<Review>Been here about 3 times and not great.  1st Time was good and Massage therapists are all very nice but 2nd time I brought my husband for a couples, the guy in the front pulled my girl off me and said she had another appointment giving me a male therapist I didn’t want. Thought I would give them another chance the 3rd time and even called ahead to request a female, about half way through my Massage the guy up front came in and tried to switch them out again!! I refused since they didn’t have any other females available and when she finished I didn’t realize til I got up front they cut me about 10 min short of an hour. Also, agree with previous post about them blocking the door and pushing tip. Do not recommend this place, Worth driving out of town.</Review><Rate>1</Rate>< response>

To make up for our mistake, I will give you a free massage with our best female massage. We are committed to building the best massage parlor in the region. Every day, many guests come here. Most of them are female guests and couples. I have got down your mobile phone number, I hope you can come back. Thank you very much!"}</response>

<time>1572019494573</time><Response>None< /Response><Review>I did not recieve a full hour. Owner/ massage therapist would disappear to the front at least 5 times. Maybe I should not of gone an hour and ten minutes before closing. I ordered the 60 minute foot reflexology massage. Massage therapist/owner, did not have clean hands as he worked on me, his hands smelled like cigarette. If it was not for the foot water, his hands would not have been washed. One time previous before, as you are asked to turn over and your face is in the hole of the massage bed, there was a strong scent of cigarette.  I believe in giving things the benefit of the doubt. Will not return. Do they change bedding or towels after a client? Or spray a disinfectant where a person's face is placed. Germs. My well being and better health is important.<//Review><username>RBC Cortz</username><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

Best massage in Merced and such a fair price! Very high quality and well-trained masseuses who really understand the human body and how to get muscle tension out. You can walk in or make an appointment. They also have discount cards!<//text>

The massage was good. Place was clean. The reason I gave three stars is because of tipping. The man in the front was very pushy about tipping. He even was telling how much I should tip.I  was going to tip regardless but didn’t like the pressure to do so. I know a couple of people that felt the same way and won’t be going back.<//text>

Not what I expected at all . rooms are not private as they claim and left still very stiff and sore . massage therapist had no strength . then as I was leaving. The gentalman was very pushy about tipping the therapist as she was standing in front of the door. I felt as if I had to tip her and didn't have a choice. I would have ether way just felt very uncomfortable about how she was blocking the doorway and him requesting I do too her.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<username>P Charles<//username><Review>Great place! Chris Mendoza is awesome in service. He got me an Uber home, and valeted the vehicle back to my house. The reps on the phone were giving me a very hard time about using that service. But Chris took care of everything. Even had the car washed and vacuumed upon return.

This was our 3rd MB purchase! from when we walked in the door til even 3 days after we were treated like a customer NOT a number..Called by first and last name...(Al) in sales walked us through and showed us all options of each van and explained why each one was a little different. Then showed us our dream van!  Made it easy to purchase! Than AFTER sale I needed a couple of accessories and thats where WONDER WOMAN stepped in SAMATHA in parts! She knew everything I was asking for and sent me updates on parts! A+ in every area..THEY ALL were practicing wearing of masks and social distancing! Clean friendly facilities too!</Review>

Only been there twice; once for parts once for service.  Everyone was very helpful.  My service experience was perfect. My advisor, Chris, was knowledgeable, personable and responsive.  I was in and out in less time than expected, he had a shop supervisor come in from the floor to answer a question for me on the spot and everything went very smooth. This is how a service appointment should go!   Thanks Chris and MB of Modesto!<//review>

<review>I had the most pleasant, professional, and efficient experience with my service advisor Chris Mendoza. During my first interaction with him, he took into consideration my time and work schedule to accommodate/schedule an appointment ASAP that worked best for me. At the time of my appointment he was able to get me in and out within 30 mins. All of his efforts were very much appreciated and he made me feel like a valued customer. The ladies at the front desk were also very helpful and pleasant. Overall great experience with this dealership.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I had work done on the car. When I got it back I noticed that they washed it. First thing I noticed was clear coat was coming off in places on the front bumper. I hand wash my car and know this wasn't there 😕.  My car has lots of rock chips and some scratches but no clear coming off anywhere. The service supervisor did a walk around circling bad areas. Like I stated front bumper has damage so I signed the paper. As soon as I seen this I reported it. The wash job was a joke. You could see all the spot they missed. On the roof you could see where they could not reach. It looked like somebody didn't care about there quality of work.<//Text>

<review>Great customer service. The ability to discuss many options and the flexibility that helps to make the right decision. I also liked the follow up after the purchase to make sure that the car and overall experience was upon buyer's convenience. Sales Rep worked hard to fine the right car for me. Finance worked harder to get the best deal that fits my budget. Thank you Wendy and Ed for the exceptional experience. Highly recommend Mercedes Benz of Modesto.</review>< Pictures>

Had an excellent experience having my Mercedes serviced today. Chris Mendoza in the service department took very good care of me, and my car, and even provided free Uber service to and from the dealership.
Definitely recommend Mercedes of Modesto, and Chris!< /review>

I recently bought a 2016 Nissan Rogue (which was a trade in) here about a week and a half ago! The staff was so amazing, especially Al! Al was my salesperson and he interacted with us personally and professionally! He didn't just treat us as a customer and I appreciate that. Thank you so much Al!

About 4 days into my purchase, my car stopped starting in the morning and it needed to be jump started. So I called Mercedes Benz and talked to a lady (I wasn't able to get her name.) I understand that I called her at 8 in the morning but she was a little rude. I said "Hi, I recently purchased a Nissan Rogue here and I was seeing if I could get it checked because I have to jumpstart it in order for it to start." The lady said, "A Nissan? This is a Mercedes Benz dealership." I told her that it was a trade in, and she said that she couldn't schedule me a service appointment because it was a Nissan, so she would have to have someone else give me a callback. I waited a whole day and I still did not get a callback. I know it's usually busy all day, so I took my car in 2 days later.

Al saw me and my husband walk through the door and greeted us and asked how he can help. I explained the situation to him. He then apologized to us for what happened(which it wasn't even his fault but I am very thankful for him). He told us he would take care of it, and he did! They were able to complete the service on it in less than an hour thanks to Al and the service man Edgar! They also keep you updated through texts while your car is getting worked on. I give a 5stars to Al and Edgar and a 4 stars overall to Mercedes Benz due to the incident that happened with me. Thank you guys!< /Text>

Al, the person who helped me with the car was amazing. My issue was with the car. A day later I bought it, I found out something with the us-c port was wrong and wouldn’t work. I had to take it in for service. On top of that, I had a loaner and someone made a dent on the back and now I’m stuck with a $1,500 bill.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have had the absolute best experience with Mercedes Benz of Modesto.  From the purchasing of my certified preowned Merc to how the Service Department handles the scheduled maintenances, they really stand by their vehicles.  They have gone as far as providing loaner vehicles as to not interrupt my busy life, when necessary, while my car is being serviced.   Chris Mendoza is an absolute professional and handled the service of my Mercedes beyond my expectations.  I do not believe in 5 Stars, as there is always room for improvement; however, Chris and the team at Mercedes Benz of Modesto seriously impressed me.  I could go on but just take away that they stand behind their cars and work hard to make sure the service and maintenance of the vehicle is as great of an experience as possible.

Sales team and manager were a pleasure to work with during the buying process.  The Sales Team Manager went out of his way to get me what I was looking to purchase.    Unfortunately, my brand new Mercedes GLE350 has been to the dealership for issues numerous times in the less than 1 year I have owned it.

The first contact service personnel have been rude and less than helpful.

I have had to called dealerships out of my area for service questions regarding error lights and system failures in progress.  When first attempting to contact my 'home' service department with these in progress issues, if they do answer the phone,  first contact has sent me to a generic mailbox at this dealership.  In instances where I was able to leave a message for service I have never had a return call.

I would recommend this dealership for the buying experience, but that is a short process.    I am not recommending this dealership because the service department would be your long term contact and they don't merit a recommendation<//Text>

Very disappointed in customer relations.  I received a 10% off my oil change so when I arrived I showed Henry Figueroa my phone with the email I received and he took a picture of it with his phone.  He explained to me that he can only give me an estimate for what I had scheduled my car for and when it was ready to be picked up they would apply my 10% off to my invoice.  When I went to pick up my car 3 hours later for an oil change the amount was still the same as the estimate. I asked the lady if that had the 10% off and she stated yes. Well when I got home and had a chance to look over everything,  there was no discount .  Ontop of that we just took our car into have the transmission looked at the end of August 2020 and they told me my car needed to be aligned.  So we did that ( $200+)  later no one said anything about my tires being bad. Well today they said I need 3 new tires! I dont drive my car very often so I highly doubt I needed tires. I took my car to our local les swab and they said my tires still have 65% tread left! Also how would 3 tires be bad if my car is awd and they just aligned it 5 or 6  months ago and my alignment was perfect today.
I checked the milage from the paperwork when we took it back in August to now and the difference was 2567miles.  I feel like this dealership isn't the most honest 😕<//text>

This was my first time to Mercedes-Benz, Modesto, for a recall.  The service was impeccable, from greeting to customer service to care for my car and a quick inspection.  The check in was easy and safe in this time of Covid-19. I felt comfortable and that they were trustworthy. Thanks.<//Review>

<review>Our car had a recall notice to check the sun roof.  MB Modesto gave me the appointment day and time I requested.  The tech staff and front desk staff were polite, friendly, and efficient.  Everyone wore a mask and practiced social distancing.  I was accommodated with a Uber ride home and back.  The car required no repair and was a free diagnostic inspection.  As a courtesy, MB Modesto washed and cleaned my car inside and out and it hasn't looked this good in years!  Thank you, MB Modesto.</review><Date>1601931300819</Date><rating>5</rating>< Gmap_id>

Extremely Disappointed with Mercedes Modesto. After keeping my car for 5 days and claiming the issue is totally fixed My GLE still has the same annoying clunking noise from front Suspension and they didn't even provide a loner vehicle. So much for buying a 70k German engineered Car. It hurts my head driving this car. And my car only has 15k miles on it. Thinking of getting rid of it and buying a Toyota instead.
*UPDATE* Manager from Merc Modesto reached out immediately and got me in touch with service manager Sandra.  She had my car picked up the same day and provided a loner. Kept the car for 3 days and had the problem resolved and all this while had me updated on the work done and had the car dropped at my house.It was a top notch customer service. Now my car drives like a Merc should. #very happy. Thankyou Mercedes Modesto.</Text>

Work performed is excellent.  Customer service is mediocre as service writers are apparently very busy and rarely return their phone calls, which can be a bit frustrating.
Would be 5 stars if communication was better.That said, I will use this dealership
again for future maintenance services.</Text>

Not all dealerships are the same! One dealership will provide a loaner car and wash your vehicle when service is done. Not sure we will go back to this dealer.< /review>

However, the service adviser was quite polite and courteous in explaining why these repairs needed, and gave me some reduction in the bill, which I appreciated.

<text>My wife's car was out of warranty because it was nearly five years old for a VERY expensive repair though it only had 46K miles. We were extremely disappointed with the car failing with such little mileage. We spoke with MBZ in Modesto and were given the bad news. A day later, the service manager, Sandra, called to say she was going to take it upon herself and have the car fixed at no charge due to the low mileage and our previous history with the brand. My wife was so happy, she literally cried. Sandra did what I considered impossible...that a dealer would be willing to repair a car that was out of the warranty period. We are beyond satisfied!!!<//text>< pictures>

I was looking for a specific Mercedes for my boss and was searching all over California for the best price. Mercedes Benz of Modesto not only match what another location was offering at a great price but Al Van Buren hustled to track down the car of her dreams! Not one sales rep at any other Mercedes worked as hard as he did to give us what we were looking for. Not only that but the visit for my boss (who was getting the car for his mother) was one of the best experiences when buying a new car. Thank you so much Al and Mercedes-Benz of Modesto for making this a great experience. It was a pleasure doing business with you!!!< /Text>

<text>Nice clean dealership and professional people. Terry Lachmund the salesperson, Joshua In Service to the Parts Manager were all wonderful and stepped up to make sure everything I had concerns on were taken care of. I bought a 2011 Mercedes E Class Blutec and Terry made it happen. I cane from the Philippines and was stuck here due to the quarantine and Modesto Mercedes helped me get into a car real quick. If you want a honest and reliable experience, go to Modesto Mercedes and speak to Terry in the Sales Dept. He will take care of you and make sure you have your dream car. Thank you Modesto Mercedes for going beyond the norm and making sure a loyal customer was taken care of.<//text><name>82nd Vet< /name><rating>5< /rating>< gmap_id>

Year after year I continue to have sub optimal experience at Mercedes Benz of Modesto. I feel like they are out to get your money and once they have sold you the car the experience really drops -  especially when you take your car for yearly servicing. This isn't something I would expect out of a luxury car retailer.</text>

If you have to go to Mercedes of Modesto get Sean as your service advisor. He’s the only advisor I have had that has not tried to rip me off and helps me understand what needs to be done right away and what is recommended. I have had to deal with other advisors there who are horrible. Always ask for Sean.</Review>

My service advisor, Sean Sands went above and beyond to ensure that I received top-notch service and even went on to discover that there were additional issues that required immediate attention. Not only did he work diligently with the warranty company to get these areas attention, he stayed in constant contact to ensure that my best interest were at the forefront.

I reside in Charlotte North Carolina and purchased a new Mercedes online from Mercedes Benz of Medesto. The salesperson I worked with was Al Van Buren. He did an incredible job.

< Review>
Hi Robert, Mr. Jang and I would like to thank you so much for your professionalism and patience.As discussed, we waited for the day you returned to work on Friday (since you were off Wednesday and Thursday). It was not our intent to try to buy a vehicle so haphazardly. As I explained, we both work in Lathrop for a manufacturing firm and it is rather difficult to get away from the plant.I feel we all did our best to meet, given our time constraints. And I feel that we were not far in price difference from accomplishing a deal. Your dealership's offer was generous, but our qualifications were on par as well: $15,000 down, no trade-in, 771 FICO score.We were off by $500 and the deal fell through, and it was certainly disappointing.Unfortunately, the most disappointing part of your dealership's experience was the General Manager named Tom. I was at a loss for words when he placed his tantrum on full display in front of a customers on their way out, and his entire staff. It was appalling, amazing, and surreal.Robert, as you know we talked several times and probably spent a total of 40 minutes during roughly 2 weeks (which really is not a lot of time invested since we knew what we wanted).What I don't understand is how can the manager of a luxury brand dealership, burst into the most unprofessional tirade for 30 minutes?As you recall, I drove through traffic from Lathrop to make this deal work.The fact remains as follows:1] He clearly became irate and raised his voice because we were considering a vehicle purchase at 06:45PM. To inject some levity I said my boss was driving in from Livermoore, to which he started verbally assaulting me. Even after I revealed that it was a joke immediately after my comment, his tirade grew worse. 2] He also shouted that you 'threw me out 3 hours ago' but now I am back.Isn't it plausible that I came back from Lathrop, through traffic, during my work hours to get a deal done? This is an extremely offensive comment, more appalling is that it came from a GM's mouth.3] He then continued to complain about my situation openly with anyone and everyone near him, huffing and puffing all the while. He then made it clear that he would not be able to go home on time, and that I had no respect for the dealership's business hours.My suggestion would be to change the business hours to closing at 5PM, so that any remaining processes would have ample time.4] I tried to calmly explain to him that I am acting as a liason for my boss since he doesn't speak English. To which he sarcastically replied: 'Oh great, yeah that's great' while throwing his hands up in the air.5] It was absolute torture having to wait for my boss while Tom the GM kept verbally bashing me and our situation. It was one of the most awkwardly uncomfortable experiences trying to buy anything. It was truly unbelievable.6] And finally, Robert and I agreed to remove a $400 charge for accessories that we never ordered or asked for and he rightfully agreed. Predictably, as soon as it was asked to be removed, Mr. Tom said the charged amount stays. So when I updated by boss who was en route, he didn't agree. Informed of this deal falling through, Mr. Tom seemed relieved and stopped his tirade because he was then able to go home 15 minutes late without selling a vehicle.In conclusion, I would like to thank all the staff at Mercedes-Benz of Modesto for your patience and professionalism. Especially, being staffed under the direction of an unqualified, unprofessional GM. I sincerely hope no one else has to inconvenience his time when they want to purchase their next luxury vehicle.</Review>

I just purchased my 2017 C300 car and the headlights look like they are 10 years old. The haze apparently is not covered under warranty and the cost for me to replace them is absurd(over 2k each)
This is not the quality or results I expect from Mercedes.
Then my car was washed and not dried leaving hardwater over the entirety of my car and I am not able to get the hardwater off the paint or windows. This will cost me $300.00 to get it detailed with hopes the hardwater will be removed.
Not happy at all.
You can call me if you wish to help me with either of the above.<//review>

We love buying our cars here. This will be the second vehicle we have bought from mercedes-benz. The service is great. The warranty they give you are worth buying a vehicle here. They have an amazing variety of vehicles and colors. They make sure you go home with a car. They take there time and actually figure out how to help you take a car home. We have always ask for Ruben. He makes sure that we take a car home and helps you if you got questions.  I definitely recommend this dealership.< /text>

<text>Very professional service and because of the work required to repair my vehicle they offered me a loaner vehicle for the duration even though i did not reserve ahead of time. The vehicle they provided was a very nice Mercedes and I definitely feel they went above and beyond to make sure our experience was up to our expectations. All of the work was completed timely and professionally. Very satisfied.< /text>< username>

I was very pleased with Aimee, my service representative.
She didn't pressure me in to something more than I came for. She made me aware of the 20,000 mile service and I chose to stay with the express oil change since my car only has 3,400 miles on it. I really liked her friendliness and appreciated her knowledge.</review>

<Review>Probably the worst car buying experience ever. You would think buying from MERCEDES BENZ you would get one of the best services and experience. Long story short recently purchased a vehicle got a great offer that pretty much sold us on the entire deal. We take our new car home, few days have passed and now the finance department is texting my personal number without my approval about he’s need me to come back in because the original deal of first 2/3 payments will be taken care of by MB. Now it’s not being honored and my credit was ran multiple times. A few with out my consent. I told I have redo the application and go through another bank/loan and having a higher payment. Now that I’m done with everything with this place I will no longer come here for anything not even my car services. AVOID THIS DEALER AT ALL COSTS, if the initial deal sounds to good to be true it probably is.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The oil change was quick and the guy who helped me was great but I had called a week ahead of time to schedule the appointment and told them I needed the airbag replaced according to many recall notices that I had gotten.  When I arrived for the appointment, they informed me that it takes a week for the airbag to be ordered and no one had ordered it.  I had driven 2 hours to the location so I was very disappointed that they neglected to tell me that they needed to order the part and that they hadn't ordered the part.</Review>

<review>Joseph S. helped us purchase our new-to-us 2013 GL450, fully loaded, at a great price.  Joseph was wonderful and great to work with! We will see him again for future vehicle buys/leases.

Sean Sands has been our service advisor. He is always professional, courteous and respectful. Sean is a great representation of the MB brand.

Thank you for taking care of us!< /review></record>

Broke down on our way back to Canada, towing our trailer. Sean took care of us right away, everyone was very nice and cheerful, they actually let us park our trailer there and stay in it while repairs were being done. Customer service was superb, a very special thanks to Sean, all the ladies at the front counter and our mechanic Mark.< /text>

I had a pleasant experience with Mercedes-Benz of Modesto. Mooly, my saleman was able to work out a great deal for me. The team overall performed well in accommodating my needs as a new Mercedes owner. They are very good at following up with their customers and more than willing to help within their expertise.<//Text>

We were very pleased with the professional service we received from Henry Figaro who was our service advisor. He was very professional, courteous and friendly. He answered all our questions and our service was done and completed in a timely manner. Our car was returned to us with maintenance completed, cleaned and ready to go! When our service is due, we will request Henry as our service advisor. We will recommend Mercedes Benz of Modesto to all our friends and family, and anyone looking to buy or service a Mercedes.< /Review>

<text>Although the big beautiful coffee machine  that was suppose to serve starbucks coffee was not working that day at the reception area, their service for the mercedes benz was quite satisfying. Friendly staff from the service area, kudos to Thomas Rios and his fellow associates, ladies at the counter. Thomas Rios communicated frequently, so I was updated with what was happening to my car while being serviced. Shoutout to Antonio Tostado who took a lot of time and effort to see, assess and talk to me on how to deal with the car. Great service from the Mercedes Modesto Team. Keep it up. - Patrick for Maria Aguilar.</text>< Rating>

<Review>Poor service. The modesto service center is a cheat, incompetent, and rude establishment. Please take your car to Fresno or the bay to get it fixed. Taken my car to them a few times, and have been dissatisfied every single time, they have over charged me, they have not looked checked the car properly and I have to end up going to Fresno to get it fixed. Spoke to the “manager Sandra” after leaving about 5-6 messages, she tried to be politely but really couldn’t care an lesser, took no responsibility of her staff or past experiences, and rudely asked me what do you want me to do and I don’t owe you anything? To a dissatisfied customer who is saying he takes his car to Fresno but would prefer come to you as I live close by. It’s been like this for 6 years and based on what I can see leading this center, it’s not going to improve in the future. I really hoped, that after the remodel things would be better, but unfortunately stay away from Modesto Mercedes service center (sales were good, I have bought a car from them and was decently happy with their sales team). I have spoken to several people who do the same and either take their car to Fresno or the bay. It’s a pity, I usually don’t write reviews, but just had to put it out there. Will be calling Mercedes head office to let them know about my experience, because clearly nobody in Modesto cared. :/</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

HORRIBLE customer service in the service department! I called to schedule an appointment and the girl kept hanging up on me. There was no returned call even after she had all my information. I called her out on it and she stayed quiet, literally. There was no apology or concern on her behalf. By the third phone call it seemed like we were getting somewhere and said she would return my call to set the appt up, needed to check with the techs for parts availability. Never got a returned call. Called the next day and none of my information was saved!! Super irritated at this point. Almost as if I never called. Didn't know it would be such a hassle for something so simple. Do not recommend this place!<//text>

From the first phone contact with Nicole in parts and the conversation with Sean in the Service dept to replace the battery in my 2014 E350 Wagon the experience was Excellent. They worked me in on a friday afternoon, had the battery in stock and installed it in short order. The customer lounge area was also Excellent, fresh brewed StarBucks coffee, Lemon Bundt cake, fresh fruit and bottled H2o. Big screen tv with a remote and comfortable chairs and couch.  And to the person everybody I met was smiling and most pleasant. Thank you folks for an Excellent experience. I will be sure to contact you folks for any future needs.

The car I bought wasn't the most expensive on the lot, but they really rolled out the red carpet. I would recommend  this dealership.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Salesman let me drive the car around answered all of my questions but when they “ran some numbers” they were horrible “Mercedes doesn’t take much off msrp “. Emailed another dealership and got an amazing deal(6000 off msrp). So I guess I can say thanks for letting me drive the car around and answering all my questions but sadly I had to go somewhere else to a dealer that was willing to sell a car.<//Text>

< review>
Last winter, I had to replace my key, as the chip was burned out.  A couple of weeks ago, the chip in the new key did the same.  Did I mention the key cost $90.00?
I went back in a cab that cost $50.00 round trip.  I forgot my drivers liceince, but had the key, the receipt for the last key, and my registration. My car is 21 years old.  They refused to replace the key, because I had no DL.  So the whole trip will cost $150.00 because I wouldn't pay the $273.00 to troubleshoot my car.  Total RIP off!!!!<//review>

This is my third Mercedes that has been serviced at this location since 2004.  Under the new ownership and the recent remodel it's really a pleasure bringing my car in for service.  I would encourage anyone who hasn't had their MB serviced at this location for awhile to come back and give them a try.  The ambience now is what I was used to in the Bay Area Mercedes Dealerships.

Side note:  The showroom is now much bigger and is ONLY Mercedes Benz so there is a very good selection of the entire line at all times.(I like to window shop while I wait for simple services to be performed or while waiting for a shuttle ride.)  ;)</review>

Had a service performed.  Service Department recommended changing wiper blades.  I changed the blades three days ago and they are working beautifully.  Service is either somewhat incompetent or dishonest. I will not return.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x80905129599de999:0x7f192964efa4a744< /gmap_id><Review>Al Van Buren was the reason I came to this dealership and bought the 2020 GLE 350, August 2019.
A few things have come up, and he always makes me feel valued.

First it was the electrical connector, U-Haul claimed it was faulty.
Al contacted service and they arranged for me to bring in the vehicle and gave me a loaner…only to find out, it was not faulty,
It was U-Haul’s, adapter, faulty.

Then the front wipers started rubbing and skipping 4 months later in December, service put on new blades no questions.
The biggie just occurred. A terrible smell was coming out to the vents. I looked online and saw there is an issue with this on several models, and my concern was mold, bacteria as my wife has asthma,
Allergies and I wanted to be sure the air coming into the cabin was not bad. I reached out to Al, he had service call me, Sean Sands set it up, being sure that they had a loaner for me..
Each of the past 2 times I was in service, Edgar would help me. He is always courteous, professional and gets the job done, this time was over the top.
When I arrived, Sean met me, and told me Edgar would be assisting me. Edgar explained, that they would take care of it, helped me with the loaner and I was on my way.
Great teamwork!

Edgar text me about 4:30pm, that the vehicle was ready.
I cannot thank you enough for the outstanding service I continue to receive at Mercedes-Benz of Modesto.
I was looking for a new dealership, I had explained to Al even before we met, I was used to excellent service, knew one of the sales managers of Tracy Honda, until he retired, not before selling me an E550 that was on the lot.
Being in real estate, I loved my Honda Accords, all 10 I bought from 2001-2016, time for an upgrade. I checked on Pleasanton, Stockton, all great people, but when I met Al, knew this is where I am going to bring my business.
Service can make or break customer loyalty, and I am very impressed with the excellent service I have received.< /Review><user_id>102942237835940136693< /user_id>< Pictures>

<text>We were leasing Mercedes C450 AMG from Mercedes Modesto for the past 3.5 years and we just returned that car to the dealership yesterday.

We were at the Mercedes-Benz of Modesto about two weeks ago to look at our car lease end options. We liked two different vehicles one was 2019 E53 AMG, and the other 2020  GLE 350.

We started negotiations regarding the lease price of E53 AMG. Mr. Ed Shimon the sales manager grew angry, belligerent and defensive during the conversation. Realizing that we probably won’t agree to terms in this car  I tried to redirect the conversation to move onto the GLE . However I was not able to do so as Mr. Shimon was not willing to discuss in his state of anger. He rudely told us we were wrong at least twice and told us to have a good day in a loud and unprofessional manner-basically telling us to leave. Therefore we did.  This was very unprofessional and frankly emotional outburst.

At this point Mr.Shimon is single-handedly responsible for losing us as customers.

Quite frankly it was the worst customer experience we ever had.

Now we’re considering other dealerships and other cars.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I came from out of town to buy. I was pre-approved with a loan for a certain amount. I was able to negotiate a lower amount for the car over the phone before I came, which is really incredible. Then, after the deal is closed, they found me a better loan offer with half the interest rate at a credit union that I had already tried to get financing but didn't get approved! How they pulled that off is a nice mystery to me. I love my car, and I loved this buying experience.<//review>< Pics>

I'm from Patterson California, my first visit today was fantastic! Locked my self out of my 2000, E320. Came in, was nicely greeted by a salesman. Walked me to the parts/service section, gave my information, ordered a new key, payed and walked out with my breath taken away. You Know Why. Great People Working At Mercedes Benz of Modesto< /Text>

<text>Bad customer service! I had to call three times in order to get help with setting up my airbag recall. When I mentioned setting up an appointment for the airbag recall the service writer (lady) hung up on me. I left messages in the past on her voicemail  and guess what, she never called me back. Maybe, she needs some customer service training.< /text><name>Erik Wright<//name><Rate>1<//Rate>< Date>

What a terrible dealership! I bought a CPO GL550 and had it shipped to my home. As a COP rule they should have taken care of any imperfections like dents , cleaning the car, etc. When receiving the vehicle there were 5 very visible small dents that could have taken care of very easily. I got a quote from a local dent doctor, but MB of Modesto did not feel that they should take care of it. They are liars and crooks. Don't believe them and don't pay before everything is perfect on your car.</Text>

<Text>Service department at modesto MERCEDES is truly unprofessional and an utter joke. I took a car in, they misdiagnosed it, told me car was ready, drove it for 5 miles, same problem came back. took it again, they diagnosed again but it didn't work. AGAIN!!! I went there spoke to the service advisor Junior and the technician and they assured me that they found the cause of the issue. I told them clearly to only perform that if its going to fix the issue. they were sure and assured me to pick the car up in 4 days. GUESS WHAT? I picked it up; drove for 10 miles, same issue again. Now I have been calling them to talk to the service advisor and his manager Sandra. left both of them voice messages, left call back NOTE at the front desk as well. it's been 2 days and they haven't called back. BTW they charged me for something they couldn't fix. i can go in more detail but my intention is only to inform future customers and prevent them from getting ripped  off by this branch of MERCEDES BENZ franchise.<//Text>< pictures>

This is the worst dealership I have ever been to. I needed a flat tire replaced. Once they found out they didn't have a tire they were done with us. I was 3 hours from home and they wouldn't even help me find another tire. I've never seen such poor customer service. I found a used tire across the street and Mercedes didn't/ wouldn't even air up my tire to get there. I would rate them lower, but 1 star is the worst I can do. Dont come here. Dont buy here.< /review>

Stay away.   They are absolute crooks.

My sprinter was taken in for service.   They went out of their way to charge me exorbitant fees that were completely unnecessary.

I would absolutely stay away from this place.   You can trust any random mechanic shop more than these crooks<//Review>

<review>If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  This place has the worst customer service I have ever experienced by any car dealership either luxury or otherwise.  We brought our 2016 car in with a flat.  When they realized they didnt have the tire we needed in stock, they refused to help us any further.  In addition, the roadside assistance they will tell you will come to your aid right away is a joke.  2 hours after this started, I was still on hold waiting and this dealership didnt help with that either.  Dont buy from here, dont even drive by.  You will regret it.  This experience just motivated me to buy BMW or Land Rover.  #Done.< /review>< Pics>

The manager doesn't know how to talk to there customers very rude and told us to never come back to this dealership I also filed a complaint with the Mercedes Benz USA main office the manager is Eddie and the salesmen was rony they both forced us to give them a 10 on the survey when they didn't even clean the vehicle after we purchase it and they just quickly washed the car and gave us the keys and I  noticed that there were dog hair in the vehicle after we purchased it and then we called the manager and told him he said we would take care of it after I received a email for survey and gave them very poor scores since there were responsible for cleaning the vehicle and customer service was very bad and my mom had drove the vehicle and got sick since she is has allergies from dogs and she has been sick for at least a week now and then when I go to pick up the car after they cleaned it the service department didn't even find keys for like 40 mins and finally I go to my car then noticed the fuel was low when the manager had promised me to fill up the gas since the incident had happened and had to wait for almost an hour to get my vehicle like seriously as well as the staff of the service department was very unorganized they couldn't find the paperwork and very unprofessional  wouldn't recommend them at all there are plenty of other Mercedes Benz dealerships out there don't choose this one you will regret it.< /text>

He doesn't treat customers with respect and he should be fired. I have no idea how he got hired there and shame on Mercedes for hiring him. I will not be servicing my car there at all, I will not recommend business to them nor will go back to them. I will take my business to the Bay Area!<//review><userid>101821946682505020496</userid>< date>

<Time>1620587435438</Time><Rate>2</Rate><review>Unless you are VERY prepared to do what you came for, this is not the place for you. Do your research for your trip before you get here, don't expect any of the window tellers, station employees, or security guards to get off of their phones to answer a question or address a concern. BRING EXACT CHANGE (VERY IMPORTANT)
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CHANGE MACHINES, AND THE PEOPLE AT THE TICKET/ CS WINDOWS WILL SEND YOU TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE, OR SANDWICH SHOP.... WHICH CHARGE $1 FOR CHANGE. Also, be ready to be immersed in garbage, because for all the money they spend on security guards who wear crocks to work while FaceTiming their man from inside of the station they're supposed to be guarding.... THEY SURE DID FORGET TO KEEP THE STATION CLEAN. Especially during the pandemic.<//review>< pictures>

My favorite all inclusive transit center in the US. Whether local on nationally however you need to travel here's the place to go. Clean facilities as well.<//Review>

<text>It's an iconic place for downtown Los Angeles and it's such a beautiful building the architecture is uniquely exquisite, elegant and a pleasure even for the soul. It's too bad part of it is close due to the pandemic but because of this situation I got to see a side I hadn't appreciated before which is the other entrance to the place which is even more beautiful than the main entrance on Broadway it's just an amazing structure that doesn't envy anything to the European renaissance buildings.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2c737bb90b4cf:0x6a32194f48a74e10</GmapID></record>

For those of us just needing to exit to the street...it's impossible!  Wound up in the wetting place because there's no direction to exit to the street.

They have us the rundown right away, about closing time for sundries shop, concessions, restrooms, and where to sit for the next 5 hours to be comfortable, as we were boarding the last ride out, at past 1am.

They even extended this treatment to non-passengers/non-customers. A couple of times over the course of the evening, folks came in wanting to get warm. Station security redirected them without demeaning them, patiently.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Crowded & a little overwhelming for new visitors to the station.  Signage could be clearer & more understandable.  Metropolitan Club isn't anything to write home about.  It's small and dengue.  Good news is that it will be going through renovations & updating soon.<//Review>< pics>

There are many Union Stations all over the US. While each has its own quality, they all look quite alike in terms of architecture and design style. However, this one is really unique. It truly blends Mexican architectural aesthetic with American. It's not all that big. But it's worth your time! Go for it. Check out especially its interiors and the wooden roof.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>April 23, 2021 front entrance is closed due to closed event. However, you may go to the far east back of that building and reach the metrolink trains. Check sat /sun  on the metrolink alerts to see if you're train is going to be cut short and you may have to be loaded on to a helpful bus to get to your destination. It's advised to check the metrolink alerts.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1584781311980</Time><rating>5</rating><Review>Union station in Los Angles is a classical structure. It’s easy to find that this station usually becomes movie scene in many Hollywood movies. Sanitation inside the building is really comfortable and clean. Walking on the corridor, I feel I was an actor in the movie (just kidding 😆).

- I took the Amtrak from Union station to Santa Fe station (San Diego). The view on the way was really beautiful. On the train, the function of USB hole was really convenient for me.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Union Station in Los Angeles is a beautiful historic building inside and outside.  If you know that you’re going to be traveling through Union Station L.A. and you enjoy historical buildings make it a point of allowing yourself some extra time to walk around Union Station inside and outside. When you get to the main room that is used for waiting on connecting Amtrak trains along with local trains like Metrolink. You will feel like you have been transferred back in time.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c737bb90b4cf:0x6a32194f48a74e10</Gmap_id></record>

The LA Union Station is really nice and luxurious feeling. The high ceilings, chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and the large leather chairs add to the overall feeling of luxury. It is a safe train station with plenty of food options and its air conditioned. I'd reccomend visiting just for the architecture. They even have a piano where passengers can play and sing to beat the time away during a layover.< /review>

The original wood and upholstered chairs are still there and are def a lot smaller than my perception as a little girl. Most workers are friendly and helpful, especially in the business lounge. They actually send a cart to take you to your train! I will def return and take some surfliner trips< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>By far my favorite place in Los Angeles. There is just something magical about this place! I visited it twice, once in the weekend around 10pm - it was crazy packed. Peeps pushing each other for a good shot/selfie. The second time was today, Tuesday around 7:30pm. It was surprisingly empty and I was able to get some good shots .</text>< Pictures>

<Name>Lynn P< /Name><review>A huge, classic Art Deco-era railroad station.  Architecture is impressive, and it is used in countless movies and ads.  Metro Stations (Gold, Red, and Purple lines) are within.  A nice lounge upstairs for Business Class-ticket holders for Amtrak trains.  Metrolink also goes out from here, so it's a real transportation hub.  Can also catch buses to LAX, and buses to Dodger Stadium, seasonally.    Fast food establishments are there for a meal or snack plus a sundry-type store.< /review><Time>1581732726857< /Time>< Rating>

What an incredible art deco architecture in this train station!

The moment you enter is like stepping back in time, the atmosphere is lovely here.
What made it even more special was the piano where just a random man was playing beautifully on.

Clear signalization in the station everywhere. Loved being here!<//Text>

This one is hard for me. So I love the station. Beautiful out of this world old school LA. But, try as they might, Amtrak security isn't able to keep all the vagrants from inside the building. I'm constantly getting asked for money, food, ciggs, you name it. A tip though. There is a second lounge upstairs that ticketed business, sleeper and same day passengers can use. You have to show your ticket at the door, but once your in it's really nice. Free drinks and snacks and a TV. Also they have a little museum of sorts up there that shows famous movies that have been made on our in trains and depots with Amtrak. Kinda cool! So if you can, go up there. There's a smoking section outside by where the buses bring you over. There's a dog fake lawn patch for your pets to relieve themselves at out there as well. Lots of security, so your safe everywhere. Make sure you go outside and look at all the beautiful gazebo areas. The architecture at this union station is amazing.< /Text>

I have been coming here most of my adult life. I love playing the piano while I wait for the Amtrak. Sometimes, I take Greyhound, but I also use MegaBus. The property is always kept up nice and there is really tight security, which I like, because I feel safe here. There are a few good choices of food, and they have a Starbucks, which is awesome. Thr place is pretty spotless for all the traffic they get. And the staff are always super nice.<//text>

Very busy like all metropolitan Transit depots... I like it, it is far better than most stations that I've been to even though it is massive movement of people everywhere, but it is still a great place to visit. The Los Angeles Police department is there to serve and protect us as well as being friendly and congenial with all our needs.</Text>

If you are traveling Amtrak, spend the extra $10 on business class if you can. Its totally awesome, they have like a vip lounge upstairs where you get free drinks, snacks, tv, redcap service (those little car things that drive you around), and a really nice clean comfy place to kick it while you wait for your train. Im telling you its the best $10 I ever spent on Amtrak.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>This an absolutely beautiful piece of architecture. We stumbled across this gem on the way to a dodgers game. Just catch the subway here and the they gave fan buses that run you to the game. The station itself is very beautiful and worth visiting. Now that we visited we were all thinking of which movies we had seen with the station in it. The beautiful chairs in the waiting lounges top it off.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnaxMncanF2QjaXkEzC50UoT8vfS9eHY8Hdreb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

I'm visiting impaired and I must say the Red Caps and most often staff here have been very helpful. I had no problems getting around and switching trains. The attendant in the Metropolitan Lounge was very nice and helpful too. Can't wait to come through here again.</text>

It feels like your walking into an old movie set on a black and white movie. It's a beautiful place. Would be great venue for a small wedding.< /text>

Union Station is a MUST when visiting Los Angeles. It is next to L.A.’s oldest street. (Another review later on) It is of a South Western Art Deco design and it is beautiful. You may get to hear live music on the open forum piano or by chance attend a Donut Festival. The best is getting a coffee and hanging just outside the main area.<//Review>

An iconic LA landmark all decked out.  Still a wonderful place to hang out waiting for a commuter train.  So much history and lots of film and movie scenes come back...presently many commercials as well.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I absolutely love taking Amtrak train. Its the best transportation. You don't have to wait in long lines here like you do at the Airport or have to take off your shoes, it's less expensive, plus the seats are roomier and it's a comfortable ride with huge windows. They also have an observation deck, a restaurant and a snack bar too. Its awesome!.< /Text>< Date>

Really beautiful station with a good variety of convenient places to get food and coffee. Nice layout of different transit modes, and easy to use machines. I think this is a gem in LA, especially to reduce car traffic and pollution. I hope the routes will be more comprehensive as time goes on. The length of travel is still a bit long for most Angelinos as everyone relies heavily on cars.

The subway was awesome to use!</review>

It's a beautiful station with british architecture. It's decently connected to the downtown. If you are comming at the night time, u might find homeless people sitting/sleeping in the waiting area, which makes it crowded. Things can get sketchy sometimes at night so try to stay inside the station. You can find police and station staff invigilating the waiting area and verifying tickets of the people occupying seats there, you may approach them in case u need help.< /Text>

Very organized, timely, etc. However, they need to do something to curtail the homeless population. As a young lady, I sometimes don't feel safe walking around here alone. Just today, my family and I got cussed out, approached by, and stares from several different homeless people who were high.<//Text>

Convenient schedules and lots of information around. They have a small food court and a nice lobby in case you have to wait for a while for your ride. Secure and clean.</text>

The building is beautiful! It's easy to find help when you need it. People is kind when you ask directions so is not a problem if you feel lost by some reason. I enjoy my experience at the union station everytime I go even when it looks like a normal thing... It's Iconic to be there.< /Text>

Easy to determine where an individual would like to go. Women's restroom on one end was closed for cleaning - only option was to walk to the other end of the building for another site. Could use additional restrooms.<//text>

<text>The trip was fantastic, a lot better way to travel if affordability is needed. I needed to get to LA from Sac and didn't want to drive, and because I needed the ticket the next day it was way more affordable than a plane ticket.

Of course flying would be preferred , Amtrak would be second great option.< /text>< pics>

If your train arrives within 2 hrs you can sit in the waiting area. If you bought a sleeper car (like a roomette) you can wait in the private lounge. Ask an employee to take you there, we couldn't find it on our own. The station is beautiful but there's a lot of homeless around.</text>

Take a trip back in time and be fully in the future. Union Station is a must for every adventurer traveling to southern California.

It is truly the hub of transportation for the city and very accessible.   When you walk through the doors you are instantly taken back to an era when train travel dominated the nation. And this place shows class.

You can easily take a train to all points from this central hub and get to every notable destination in not only the the local area but regionally as well as exploring the country.

Take a weekend up to Santa Barbara or ride the subway to Hollywood.

It's all here.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>And iconic and absolutely fantastic train station. Located right in the Heart of Los Angeles. There is so much to do in and around Union Station. It is very safe to be in there. Patrolled constantly by police officers. Amtrak and Los Angeles PD. Also they have rental car pickups there. Both Hertz and budget are there. They have and Metropolitan Lounge for those who are first class passengers. Great place to catch trains. They also have fantastic Red Cap service that is always available to help you. Historic and great sections in the front of the station are always good to look at. Sad to see traxx go out.</Text><userid>108996444818530841090<//userid><user_name>Fred Kurzweil</user_name><Time>1569457766691< /Time><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

The train is certainly a form of transportation you can enjoy! Stress-free and carefree. Take a leisurely ride on the Amtrak train system after hurrying through this ample terminal and navigating the drug addicts who haunt the rest room areas..! The service from the attendants on the trains is superb!</Text>

Love Amtrak and their first class lounge. Well worth the extra fee to upgrade, drinks, snacks and Red Cap shuttle driving you directly to the train from the lounge are included. The train station itself is very clean and well-organized lots of different places to eat, sit or just relax.</Text>

Everything was pretty clean, even the restrooms, everything was well marked and the staff is very helpful. Can't imagine the chaos during a weekday (I went there on a holiday) but when it's not too busy is a nice place to visit as part of the historic landmarks of L.A.< /Text>< pics>

I’ve never seen a dirtier station in all my world travels. Feces on the floor of the restrooms, needles lying around, blood on the walls. I would have rather used the restroom outside with the homeless people than to use this one!< /text>

A place that is competing to be a historic beautifully designed transport hub and a mad house of rowdy homlesss people , no power outlets , restrictive seating, topped off with the an overwhelming stench of urine in some areas. A true reflection of what LA is today. As well the typical solution of a larger police presence seems to create nothing but an uneasy mood without any order. If you wanna see LA and it's problems and also some of its Glory take a gander through union station .<//Review>

Much better than I remembered it being. I'm glad to see as much security as I did, and it was fairly easy to make your way through. I'm glad it was a quick stop, but those restrooms...... Horrible conditions, when they improve, I'll be happy to upgrade to a five star.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This place is a cathedral to transportation! The warm lighting and the soothing 'whisper' of all the combined chatter always feels like a welcome home, and i make it a point to get to the station long before my train is boarding, just so i can spend some time in here.  Union Station is a beautiful building to pass through, to wander around, and if you look into the history of it, you'll appreciate it so much more! Their FREE events here, from movie screenings to the train days are so much fun to attend, and although they can get busy, the bathrooms are always open and staffed. I've also had great experiences talking to the officers and people at the information desk, who are always friendly and willing to help. If you can leave the car at home for a day and just take the Metro into this building, you definitely should- it's one of Los Angeles' treasures< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c737bb90b4cf:0x6a32194f48a74e10</gmapID></record>

You either like it or you don't! It's a historical building to be enjoyed for its architectural history. It's also great for people watching. If you are into both these things since there are definite some wild characters at this place. Wether you take the Amtrak or the Metrolink, either one is an exciting experience I recommend to all.< /Review>

A nice old style train station. This place has a lot of history. Amtrak and Metrolink stop here. You can also catch several Metro busses and the Red, Purple, and Gold lines. LAX fly away, and Dodgers shuttles are also here. There's lots of security and police so it's safe. They recently upgraded the restrooms. Amtrak has a Metropolitan lounge for business class, and sleeper car passengers.  Union Station also has several events going on throughout the year.<//Text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>Union station would be pretty good if it wasn't so dirty and if it didn't feel like a homeless rec center.  There is no reason to be here unless you are passing through (train,  metro,  etc) so your exposure is limited to time spent waiting for your transportation to arrive. The dining options aren't great and the staff isn't helpful.  It's a beautiful building,  just don't hang around too long.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2c737bb90b4cf:0x6a32194f48a74e10</GmapID></record>

<Text>La Union Station is a wonderful amazing landmark of history from back in the old days of Los Angeles that I highly recommend anybody to go and visit and just go and see the landscaping and see the walls and see the art and see the architecture and see the amazing way it was from what it was before and all the history that it has and it's just a great place is kind of like a museum in a way and it has a great crepe place to get grape crepes with bananas with Nutella in it it's just a great place all in general and has little bar if you're waiting for your train great platforms even have accessible golf cart rides to your terminal if you need it it's pretty wonderful experience and very grateful that my grandma was well taken care of when she got on to her trying to get to where she needed to go and it was just a wonderful experience in general thank you so much I'll Union Station for Verizon such a writing such protection and all the officers and scary and staff that are at this location there just their point about everything and they're very well staffed and trade to take care of people take so much< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c737bb90b4cf:0x6a32194f48a74e10< /gmapID></record>

<text>Better know what line and color  you are getting on because if not... You will get lost and be headed the wrong direction. Map out your directions before you get on the train. Also, you can go anywhere from the L.A Union Station. Great if you don't have a car or don't want to sit in L.A. traffic!<//text>< pictures>

It's really full and a bit intimidating when you first get there but it's actually pretty easy to get around! There are a lot of seats to just relax if you want and there's also the food court to get a snack while waiting for your bus or train. They also have an information desk at the entrance where you can ask for help if you need it. There are plenty of restrooms here too. It's a pretty good place.</Text>

It is a beautiful station.  Plus El Pueblo de Los Angeles is very close to it.  Also, it is easy to get to the station.< /Text>

Union Station is definitely a beautiful building very busy but the employees are very attentive. Found my way around there pretty easily, because it's definitely very very big in there. I think the only thing I would say negatively is that they don't have  smoking areas or a lot of seating in or around the building.<//Review>

<Review>I had a spend more time than I expected  at the station.Its large and fun ..lots of the usual shops and food...I went to the " 1st class"lounge...boy the trains have come along way ! They took  all of us to the trains  baggage  and all..on the train  we got box goodies and  something  to drink no...not that kind of drink..although they did have champagne. The crew was great! I am going to take the train to LA more often!

It is also easy to navigate. We travel through here often and are happy to do so. Ride share access is easy and quick and the station is the gateway to Olvera St, Chinatown and DTLA.<//review>< Gmap_id>

The station itself retains the charm of when train travel was really the only way to get anywhere. The decor of the 1930's and '40's can still be experienced when you enter but it does need a lot of TLC to bring it up to snuff.<//Review>

<Text>Very nice station! Definitely old but very cool! Easy to figure out where you're going. Signs all over the place & couple of Officers I did ask for help we're very friendly & helpful. Very easy to get to & from the airport at this station! However I only found one bathroom area, I'm sure there are more. And they try very hard to keep it clean, it could just use some updating.<//Text>< pictures>

I have been here many times. Union Station is interesting and very well organized. There are very good directions on how to find your way around and there are places to get something to eat. You can even get the FlyAway bus from here to go to LAX. There are also other easy connections to Orange County as well as the Central Valley.</Review>

Very nice interior architecture with leather seating for patrons with a ticket boarding within 2 hours. Nice piano with musicians playing passionately. Only complaint would be there's no water fountain and there no good signage for Amtrak boarding.< /Review>

I love going through Union Station, everything from the feel of a hundred years ago to architecture and a piano that people can play on, not to mention one of the best creparias I've ever been to, and a lovely place to sit and watch the passers-by. Numerous other good venues for food and drink. Is it a navigate, easy to use taxi and Uber area, and a back way that you can slip in and out of once you know the station to save better time especially if you are taking the surfliner which is always on tracks 8 through 10 up at that end.<//text>

An historic building. Lovely structure, well-worn. It's busy. A number of light rail lines terminate here (gold, purple, red lines). Metrolink heavy rail is here too. Amtrak trains also run through the station.

Food choices are pretty dank here.

Definitely take the time to walk the flhalls.< /Text>

The architecture of the building is pretty awesome to look around for it's historic significance.

There's an assortment of sit down and fast food places to grab something to eat while waiting for your train.

The general area was clean and we'll kept.

There's really no general seating if you're waiting for your train, unless you have a ticket with a departure time within 2 hours.  I'm sure it helps cut down on loitering, but don't know what someone would do if they had a long layover.

Didn't find any power outlets, so that's a have if you need to charge your mobile device.< /Text>

There are fast food shops, restaurants, little shops, and a Starbucks for your convenience. Fairly large bathrooms. A generous amount of ticket booths. Train schedules listed above the terminals. And there are alot of people who work the grounds to help you find your train or any other information.< /text></record>

I love it every time I come to visit Union Station. The architecture is Simply Beautiful and very nostalgic. I am a regular user of the MetroRail whenever I need from downtown because it is so much more convenient than driving and fighting to get a parking space. I usually write it to the Little Tokyo / Arts District station. But if I want to go to Olvera Street, Chinatown, or Philippe's restaurant I take it all the way to Union Station. I always take a minute the shop souvenir trinket kiosk or grab a quick snack in the food court. Always a pleasure coming here.<//review>

The primary gateway into and out of LA, via the train.

It's urban, so it has some rough edges. Being focused on getting people in and out, seating is lacking.

If the weather is nice, and when isn't it in Southern California, sit outside near the water agency building. Peaceful old fountains and courtyard will take your mind far from the bustle of LA.

The architecture of the station is beautiful. Pause to appreciate the ambition, craftsmanship, hope, and pride that existed in the 1920s.

Since we're taking the train, slow down. Enjoy the journey.</Text>

<Review>My family loves riding on trains! The convenience and ease of reading from where each train will depart is great. Also, enjoy the fact that we can stop in and grab a snack from the store, Wetzels or Starbucks. Last, but certainly not least love the communal piano where many artists will stop and play for a bit. My sons are always pleased when we can catch a song or two.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c737bb90b4cf:0x6a32194f48a74e10</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amtrak closed when i got to the window, before their prayed time, and would not answer my questio.   There was a young lady security officer there, she  was very pleasant, most helpful, and gave me directions so i didn't have to figure out what to do until the station reopened.< /Review>< Date>

I wasn't visiting for myself, dropping a friend off. However if you want to avoid being harassed by the security on dropping off or unloading, take the path to back area of the station and it make all transitions easy, dropping off, loading, and even have some friendly redcaps that could be of help. It also prevent a long walk to the ticket desks.<//Text>

During the evening close to station homeless sleep in the station in an orderly manners with station security presence. My humble suggestions that visitors purchase Business Class ticket and enjoy the business class lounge with free flow of light snacks and beverages. When train ready for boarding AMTRAK Business Lounge staff would arrange "Free Red Cab" driver to sent business class passenger for boarding. Tipping is encouraged to show our appreciation.</Review>< Pics>

FYI, access to the Metropolitan Lounge is right across from the rental car counters and involves a flight of stairs.  After you are in the lounge, no more steps and you will be able to take a ramp to a redcap shuttle (golf cart) that will take you  to your platform.  Great service by all the Amtrak employees I encountered.</Text>

<Text>Dirty dirty dirty, but what can you expect. I like that there’s a good number of staff and security around to keep it a safer plaice. Trains and transit is ok, fairly simple to buy a ticket and find your train. Lots of solicitations outside, but that’s LA. A deep cleaning and a light remodel would lighted this iconic place up. Would love to see better transit in LA.< /Text>< time>

At LA Union Station,you can travel just about every where...that place is heavily guarded so I know I'm safe there, stores to buy your travel needs, there's even a store in there that accepts EBT. The trains have always been on time and the workers there are very friendly and helpful💯💪🏾❤️</review>

Los Angeles Union Station is the main railway station in Los Angeles, California, and the largest railroad passenger terminal in the Western United States. Its main terminal where you can catch bus or train for entire city as well as other cities in california or other states.<//review>

Lots of culture, art and events every time I've been there.
There's a beautiful piano open to the public, occasionally with a player that really knows what they're doing.
Quite a few cooperate food places in the area if you're feeling peckish<//Text>

I wish someone would train the staff.  Literally no one except the staff member behind the Amtrak window knew where the Amtrak trains were.  Tons of staff on the floor.  All of them are clueless.  I guess they get paid to stand there and look pretty.

Missed the train because people kept having me walk back and forth looking for a train that already left.  Next train wasn't till 6am, took a Lyft because that was a more reliable mode of transportation.<//review>

Very interesting very historic station lots of grandeur and Glory from days gone by and trying to bring it back to this century there's a few areas that are a bit Shady but it is heavily patrolled by police so there was a certain Comfort level that made it feel safe some really great restaurants and there are a couple that have an extremely unusual menu but all in all a good experience great place to visit with history and wait for your train Amtrak Metropolitan Lounge is a great way to relax when you're traveling first class<//review>

<Review>Beautifully restored Art Deco era train station in center of LA. It had been years since I was there, and the restoration is spectacular. You can catch a glimpse of what LA was in the golden era of film. (it's also the scene of the police station entrance in original Blade runner). Traxx Restaurant is a nice place to eat. Food was pretty good.</Review>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I was at the union station on the 5th of October and all of the employees I interacted with were super kind and knew their job! They were so helpful especially the young black lady security by the escalator. She helped me like three times and didn't even get annoyed. And the the male security man helped me find floor P & the elevator and the train regulator woman was complimenting my green wagon which made my day because I love that wagon hahaha. I had a great time Saturday! Thanks union station workers for making the union station experience memorable.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>The metro system is average compared to those in European and Middle Eastern countries. Not a very user friendly place either and one has to seek guidance from local officers to navigate to your gate or for further information. They should invest in faster trains which would also help reduce traffic congestion on freeways.</review>< Pictures>

Fairly clean train station with several places to eat inside. There are also areas where you can sit while waiting for your train. The station also connects to the subway and the bus stop is very practical for getting around Los Angeles.</review>

This is a railway station near la Puebla. The first time I entered it was nighttime and in the half light you remember every film noir you have ever seen. You feel as if you are in a movie set. Would recommend a visit to anyone visiting Los Angeles as tourist.<//Text>

Historic and beautiful building. Very safe, guards and police are always here. There is a kiosk to buy tickets and "DIY" stations to obtain a ticket through an electronic kiosk. Plenty of opportunities to eat; restaurant and snack shop. Easy to access train platforms and Departure/Arrival schedule.<//review>

It's beautiful but unless you are taking Amtrak or at an underground metro there is nowhere any more inside to sit if you need. (Most likely due to local vagrants who would use the chairs.)<//Text>

Nice, historical, old train station. Just don't visit late at night or if you do don't go outside to see the gardens or you'll get locked out until after 4am. Makes for a very long and cold wait time. And don't expect any help from security.</text>

The day before my train, I called ahead to schedule wheelchair assistance because I injured myself and was on crutches. They assured me someone would be there when I arrived and gave me a number to call five minutes before my arrival. I called the number multiple times and no one answered. When I arrived, I asked a security guard for help and was left waiting for 20+ minutes outside standing in the cold on crutches. No one offered help with my bags and I almost missed my train. Its frustrating because I took the time to call ahead and schedule and upon my arrival no one could be bothered to help. I was told to arrive 45 minutes to an hour early for my 6am train but when an officer finally took the time to speak with me he told me wheelchair service wasn’t available until 545am. Hugely negative experience seeing how little this place cares about their customers.</text>

Per advice, I never wandered outside the station grounds into the surrounding neighborhood. There are seating areas with boards showing arrivals and departures info. There's a Starbucks and other food and beverage places inside the main station area. There's a fair amount of security personnel. I wouldn't fall asleep and leave my bags unattended. I definitely recommend using checking youy bags to your destination, especially if you have to transfer. Leave that to Amtrak.< /Text>

<Review>I could spend my time exploring the Union Station as you could always travel from there catch the Metrolink, Greyhound bus you name it you have many options to choose from. As I always travel from the Valley to Union Station you're not only get to many different people from all walk of life will your on the RedLine you enjoy the atmosphere it bring will you get to your destination.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Logistical mess to actually get to the airport. Some interesting characters hanging around here too. Trains are frequently delayed or cancelled. Trains run to places maybe once an hour or more - definitely not world class service where trains run to important places every 5-10 minutes (even in some 3rd World countries). Meanwhile, we keep stuffing the highways with more cars that can't move anywhere. Perhaps our decision-makers need to leave the country once in a while to get a clue. Train staff are very professional, but for infrequent or delayed services, completely overpriced. Still a nice change from a commute if you have the time.< /Review>

Love to Travel to and from Union Station. Beautiful Archeticture, A variety of Events that take place give it some culture which it had been lacking for a while. Two thumbs up.< /review>

Clean. Plenty of parking. Uber/lift pickup right outside of main entrance. Historic building and grounds have been preserved. Public bathroom. Available along with small food court. Food is more expensive of course. Plenty of signs to guide you. Their xmas lights and tree display are awesome!< /text>

<Text>A historical landmark in bedded in Los Angeles. Union Station has a refurbished decor with a rich 1930's or 40's style. If you're not using the variety of trains and/or buses; a great place to visit for it's nostalgia.</Text>< rating>

This station is pretty amazing in scope and size. Had trouble getting red cap services from Amtrak for my early on-set Alzheimer's father-in-law and though his disability isn't severe they almost didn't let him travel alone.< /Review>

<date>1531610331251< /date><review>This is the hub for city busses, Metrolink, Amtrak and metro rail. You can purchase tickets for all the transportation options at this station.  It's a big station plenty of seating however it closes to the public from 2 to 4 a. M. Unless you have a Amtrak ticket in your possession.  There is a store there, Subway and Starbucks. There is also an outside patio. The one bad thing about this place is there is absolutely no electrical outlets. Of course there is bathrooms. There is also general information here. There is even a piano you can play limited to 20 minutes.<//review>< userid>

<text>This is old LA showing off. It's got all the hallmarks of the grand old style of train stations from another era. You should definitely take the time to go there and  see what this is. It's clean enough but not spectacular which holds down the stars. However it's highly functional and a good space for events and photographically.  Your hard pressed to find a more iconic space.</text><user_name>Ruben Williams</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Took Amtrak to Santa Barbara for the first time, buying a ticket here was quick and easy, upgraded for $16 to first class which means you had access to a small lounge with drinks and snacks. On the train you also get free coffee and water.<//text>

Bathrooms are clean enough, the whole place is well kept, the food places make your visit very pleasant. My only concern is the fact that such a big place has no real help for people with mobility issues like myself<//text>

<text>This place is beautiful and historic. Perfect place for a wedding or whatever big event you need to rent a hall for. Also excellent for filming commercials or even a tv show. Go visit Union Square if you've never been there and your looking for somewhere to go sightsee< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>Charming building. Just needs.... a little cleaning. A small well I assumed once used to be filled with water is now filled with trash. I commute to LA twice a week and the ticket purchasing machines are in dire need of an update; they're quite laggy. As for the positives, the site is overall quite pleasing to the eye. Stained windows, a piano free for anyone to pay, grand stair cases. The sitting area available for those riding a train within the next two hours is a comforting plus.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

It's a gorgeous place for photo ops and ogling. Very close to Olvera st and Chinatown. I understand and appreciate them trying to keep homeless people out, but sectioning off the seats makes one feel like you're in a cattle pen. The Amtrak employees are pretty helpful but the metro ones are 100% done with people and it shows. Theres a great (if a little expensive) coffee shop towards the back of the station, and Starbucks up front if you like long lines. The little market there (used to be famima) is ok but smells like old grease and stinks up the lobby. Great variety of snacks though. Dont bother with the bathrooms. Just hold it til you get on the train.<//Text>

LA Union Station is a Mission Revival train station that is located just North of Downtown on Alameda and Cesar Chavez Blvd. This is the major terminal for Amtrak service on the West Coast. Metrolink, the local commuter passenger railway also ends here. This is the where both Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Agency Red and Green Lines terminate and Gold Line passes through has a station on Tracks One and Two.< /review>

<review>There is nothing I like about the LA station. Everyone is rude and no one seems to know what they are doing. They lost both of my checked bags, changed my route from 2 transfers to 6 and half the time we were on buses. A few days after I arrived to my destination and tons of phone calls later. We found one bag that was half emptied. The only things remaining is my clothes. This station has no respect, no boundaries, and no security. Do not bring anything you are not ok with losing. They will take it.<//review>< resp>

It's nice to just sit there in the Metrolink and relax and get to your destination and get back.   They're very helpful inside the Union station and on the Metrolink.  "Thank you very much".<//Review>

No place to recharge phones in main waiting room. Attendant wanted the tickets. When I remarked that most 21st century waiting rooms should have a place to recharge phones it was plain she didn't understand what the 21st century was about.< /review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><rate>5<//rate><review>Los Angeles Union Station is an iconic piece of history and a beautiful station. It is the central station for the city and it is here you will find both the Metrolink train system that runs throughout the county of Los Angeles over several lines, and into Ventura, Orange and San Bernardino counties as well. Additionally, the Amtrak trains pass through here as well. The station also is the terminus for the Red and Purple subway lines, and for the Gold line. There are help desks available for all systems, as well as ticketing kiosks and maps. The station is large, filled with beautiful early twentieth century architecture and fittings; the markets and restaurants inside are tastefully fitted into the structure.</review>< Name>

There needs to be more public seating options available. I never have a difficult time finding a place to sit if I go to the airport early. I should have a difficult time if I show up to the train station early.</review>

The security guards were not helpful when asked a question. You can not charge your phone while you wait for your train,because there is no plug ins no where an even in an emergency they will not assist you in getting your phone charged. No on helps you figure out where to go to the store if you never been there. An the people are crazy, on some bad drugs, or something because that is all there is at Union Station in L.A.<//Review>

<Review>Wonderful Art Deco architecture in the waiting area.  Several food and beverage shops.  20 tracks plus access to Metrorail.  Services Amtrak, Metrolink, and bus services (local and long distance).  Rest rooms crowded, unclean, old.  Could benefit from moving sidewalks as many airports now use.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
If it wasn't because someone took my key's there in the waiting area, I'll defenelly give 5⭐ but is a shame it happen while the guards or security staff was there.
Then the lost and found situation and no communicating between the Amtrak and metrolink staff, employees and police officers there is very poor. Need to come to a solution for this problem. Is to me a precious memories and my son's favorite place because he likes train's so it become important to me.

Need better system of putting the trains for Metrolink, or more assistance in getting you to the right trains. Food is too expensive if traveling on public transportation you must not have alot of money.</text>

< review>
The security here is rude and not helpful. I would never recommend this place to anyone because you will most likely get robbed or catch a disease at this location. There are no electrical outlets anywhere for you to use. Do not go here.</review>

It sucks not the same place it used to be where people could stop and relax plus the people that work for security are very rude and always arguing or fighting with people there.</Text>< Rating>

Huge place but too many homeless people in their and their public transportation maps are too confusing compared to the other Big cities like New York and Chicago that have a faster service and cheaper than L.A.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) A beautiful old train station. With a hall that you can hardly get enough of. No loitering shady people, no begging, no filth to see. Many train stations could take a break from that. It was worth going!

(Original)
Ein wunderschöner alter Bahnhof. Mit einer Halle an der man sich kaum sattsehen kann. Kein herumlungern von zwielichtigen Menschen, kein Betteln, kein Schmutz zu sehen. Da könnten sich so manche Bahnhöfe ein Eckerl abschneiden. Es war wert hinzugehen!<//review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Union Station is one of Los Angeles's most historic buildings, opened in 1939, and the transcontinental railroad, commonly known as Amtrak, departs from here.
This station is the main station on the west coast and connects to the subway as well as long-distance trains. The east exit is mainly the place where the bus to LAX Airport called "FLY AWAY" leaves, but there is only a roundabout in front of the station and there is nothing else. The west exit should be the gateway to Union Station.
Compared to the terminal stations in Japan, the number of people is small.
Little Tokyo is just south of here.
Just south of it is Skid Row.

(Original)
ユニオンステーションは、1939年にオープンしたロサンゼルスでも歴史のある建造物で、大陸横断鉄道、通称「アムトラック」はここから発着しています。
この駅は西海岸の主要駅であり長距離列車だけでなく地下鉄にも接続しています。東口は主に「FLYAWAY」と呼ばれるLAX空港へのバスがでている場所となりますが、駅前のロータリーがあるだけでそれ以外のものはありません。西口がユニオンステーションの玄関口というべきでしょう。
日本のターミナル駅と比べると人は少なめな印象です。
ここからすぐ南にリトルトーキョーがあります。
そのすぐ南にスキッドロウがあります。< /review>

(Translated by Google) A beautiful historic building, no less beautiful inside than outside. You can go to all kinds of directions from this station.
And the most photogenic are probably the palm trees at the entrance to the station. It is not just that this building served as a backdrop for a Hollywood movie.

(Original)
Красивое историческое здание, внутри не менее красивое чем снаружи. Можно отправиться в самые разные направления с этого вокзала.
А самые фотогеничные - это, наверное, пальмы у входа в вокзал. Не просто так это здание послужило декорацией для голливудского кино.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a very clean, cultured station compared to the city. With the help of a large underpass, it is very easy to adjust.
It is very practical because if you drive from the bus station to the city center, you will save a lot of road by using the underpass of the station, the buses will stop right behind the station.

(Original)
A városhoz képest nagyon tiszta, kulturált állomás. Egy nagy aluljáró segitségével igen könnyen el lehet igazodni.
Nagyon praktikus, mert ha a buszállomásról a belvárosba tartasz, akkor az állomás aluljáróját használva nagy utat megspórolsz, a buszok pont az állomás mögött állnak meg.< /Review></record>

(Translated by Google) A great building and almost too nice for a train station. As good as no rabble and El Pueblo right next to it!

(Translated by Google) This is the first railway station to be built in Los Angeles. It was created thanks to the collaboration of three of the most important railway companies in California - Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and Archison, Topeka anf Santa Fe Railway. Its opening in May 1939 was accompanied by 3-day celebrations and parades. The building is built in the style of the Spanish Renaissance, there are arches, arcades, wooden decorated ceilings and stucco. Interesting fact - the walls of the building are covered with cork - there is no echo. Waiting room with wonderful leather seats available to holders of a valid train ticket.
In addition to the train station, the station includes underground metro stations, a station and a bus terminus.

(Original)
To pierwsza stacja kolejowa, jaka powstała w Los Angeles. Powstała dzięki współpracy trzech najważniejszych przedsiębiorstw kolejowych w Kalifornii - Union Pacific, spółki Southern Pacific i Archison, Topeka anf Santa Fe Railway. Jej otwarciu w maju 1939 roku towarzyszyły 3-dniowe uroczystości i parady. Budynek jest wybudowany w stylu hiszpańskiego renesansu, są łuki, arkady, drewniane zdobione stropy i sztukaterie. Ciekawostka - ściany budynku pokryte są korkiem - nie występuje zjawisko echa. Poczekalnia ze wspaniałymi skórzanymi fotelami dostępna dla posiadaczy ważnego biletu kolejowego.
Dworzec oprócz stacji kolejowej to podziemne stacje metra, dworzec i pętla autobusowa.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) One of the very beautiful stations of the USA. There is always something going on and security is always there. The typical Spanish missionary style of California is reflected in this architectural work that has inspired many works (Blade Runner, Italian Turnaround, GTA 3 ...).
