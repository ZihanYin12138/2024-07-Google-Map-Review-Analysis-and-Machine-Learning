< review>
Gary and Yvette were amazingly helpful representatives. Yvette made my reservation and Gary got me set up with my actual storage unit & contracts. They were extremely welcoming and answered every question with patience and thorough detail. I appreciate this level of customer service as moving is stressful! Their office had a variety of supplies to purchase and I found the facility to be extremely convenient and clean. I’m really happy with my selection I shopped around and this was the best deal in my area. It’s a bonus that the employees are also so kind & considerate.</review>

BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER 👌
I've recently returned from the storage unit i rented, Even before entering the establishment i was welcomed in by Yvette and she Even held the door open for this old man. She then introduced herself and her co- worker Barry. They were not only professional but personable as well, they took the time to hear my needs and let me share a few of life's experiences and laughed along with me.
As for the business/ facilities, the building is VERY NICE!!! Clean and secure. I seriously feel this will be the best place for my property's and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE 👌</text>

Great brand and spanking new facility, easy access even though they are located close to downtown.
Their prices are pretty competitive too since they have specials going on. I have another smaller storage unit in Denver and it costs me more in Colorado.
Customer service is amazing (by Ivette), I got all my deal done in minutes via phone, so by the time I made it there with my stuff everything was ready for me.
I feel like all my stuff is at a very reliable and secure place for a very good price.
Highly recommended!!!< /Text>

Yvette and staff have been amazingly supportive of me while I had to move things into my storage unit alone with a broken foot during a month when I had to hurry and get things out of the house I was selling. When I couldn't walk to the office to get the key for the cart/dolly, she brought it to me at the elevators so I wouldn't suffer through the move. Everyone is pretty polite and friendly here, which makes it pleasant to come to the storage unit. I am used to storage companies with indifferent or curt staff but Yvette and crew have been really positive and helpful.  The team at 1000 N Main St. make StorQuest look good and thus put the storage company on my radar for future storage needs.< /Text>

Thank you so much Yvette. Honestly some of the best customer service, she took her time to break down the prices to see what works best for me and gave me a quick run down of the facility. This location was extremely well maintained and air conditioned which is a plus. Would highly recommend!!!< /Review>

<Text>I have been a 2 year renter at the StorQuest on Hill street/Los Angeles. I was prepared to take my business to another company due to poor poor customer service. The main reason was they say your rate will increase 15% in 6 months. My rate increased +25% in 6 months. No explanation but many excuses.

Today that changed when I met Victoria at the StorQuest, 1000 N Main Street Los Angeles. The service and location is night and day. Victoria cared and offered many solutions to meet my needs. I feel confident I made the right choice to change locations. The place is very clean, easy access, and spacious. Close to freeways. Lots of parking.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This Storquest has been the perfect place to rent out of. It’s super clean and safe in a quieter part of town, so always feel comfortable. Yvette and the management are so welcoming and friendly you really won’t find anything better!<//text>

It’s my first time paying for a storage unit and Yvette was really helpful. She talked to me about the pricing and showed me the unit I requested before moving my items and answered all my questions. She was super kind in offering to show me other units I may need if my needs exceeded the one I paid for. She explained to me the pricing in boxes and other helpful tips in moving my items in. This process has been made super easy.< /Review>

Called in a day ago to get a unit , an associate reserved one for me over the phone. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make it in that same day so they held my reservation and contacted me telling me they had did so. They called the next morning checking to see if I was okay and still interested in the unit . I ended up coming in and was greeted by Ref . He showed me my unit I loved it! Lol Within minutes I was out with a new clean big affordable storage unit! I’ve been to other storage companies and was never treated so nice they just wanted to get my money and get on with their day. This one is different I didn’t feel rushed or anything. Ref took his time to show me the unit and how to easily get to and from my car. I’d definitely recommend this location!!! Oh and it’s new ! So big and clean lol !<//text>< gmap_id>

<Text>I love this place for so many reasons.  An excellent (free) play date meet up spot with reasonably priced food/drinks.

It’s an excellent place to bring your own food to and don’t forget your water bottles to refill from the ice cold drinking fountain!

There is a play structure and also lots of floor space to run around on.  Air conditioned nicely for these hot summer days.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>5< /rating>< user>

It's wonderful during super hot or super cold days...the kids can safely play while the parents visit. I've never met a staff member without a big smile. Very good people, food and coffee!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Great family environment. Great staff. Very large room with play structure and indoor turf for endless possibilities of family fun activities. Average to lower priced coffee, snacks and simple foods to reenergize.  Great place for a casual business meeting if you need to bring along the kids.</Text>

Awesome that Bayside would open up this place for the community.  Great indoor play area for kids when it is too hot or rainy to play outside.< /text>

Awesome indoor park, plenty of colorful seating options, and a large fake indoor tree likely a metaphor for the Bayside Church.</text><GmapID>0x809b222b8442143d:0x603be3946e86705e</GmapID>< Pics>

This place is A-Mazing! Big indoor play structure and a huge plot of turf with chairs for parents to sit while the kids run around. The cafe itself is also great. Really fun drinks that are made well and lots of snack AND food options. Can't recommend enough!<//Review>

<Review>Awesome! It is a big open room, cafe, play structure, bathroom, couches, rugs and chairs. Half of the room has fake grass on the ground a huge artificial tree and outdoor chairs. Kids Love it, my son calls it wacky tacky! And it is free, all except the cafe that is.</Review>< pics>

<review>I just got my hair done here. The staff is pretty awesome. The owners - well...they could use a little more of their employees' enthusiasm. The ladies we worked with, in particular were very sweet, engaging, and knew what would look best for my family' long, thick hair. For 4 women, we were out of there in a little over an hour, which is pretty incredible consiering the great job they did. The prices are very reasonable as well. Hopefully we can get their assistance again for an engagement party tomorrow! :)</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpDXb3lG6hga02Bj7IZP5WQYQKw12UlTHt3sDe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

Bring CASH as they are temporarily accepting cash only; however, once virus is better handled AND cases subside, they will once again accept debit.

Update: they raised up their price to $30 for women’s haircut and $15 for men. They also charge a $1 fee for using your credit card now.<//text>< Pics>

This place is awesome! With most great businesses it starts at the top and the owner (Joyce) is simply amazing. She knows her craft and is patient and very understanding of your needs. She creates a very care free and easy going work environment for her employees so they can all do top notch work without extra added stress. Joyce does my fiance's hair and colors mine. Kevin is the only one to cut my hair. Definitely a gem to be found.< /text>

< Review>
Had my perm straight last month worth $365(including eye brow wax). I told them to cut my hair for the $250 worth so they did but still I paid $365 so that was fine since I have thick hair.  After 3 days need to wash it as directed, I was disappointed ends were terrible, went back there for back job so they did it but got worse my hair are falling and ends still not straight.</Review>

It is busy, that's why only 4 stars out of 5. I never had a surprising bad experience. They can even handle my special cowlicks. Pricing is not cheap, but also not super expensive. All in all absolutely worth to try. I heard  about them from a Vietnamese co-worker. Thanks for the recommendation.</Review>

The receptionist ( or might be mananger) is rude and pushy. The price is aforedable, but you may end up going somewhere else like me to have better customer service by paying some more bucks.< /review>

I always come here for good quality, affordable haircuts.  It's $12 for a male haircut and they include shampoo washing and rinsing of your hair 1-2 times per cut.< /Text>

<text>I've been here a few times. Most of the times they are slower than most Subways in town but they get the job. Sandwiches taste the same as any other Subway. Place is usually clean.

<text>Good food and nice servers. The restaurant could have been a little cleaner, especially by the soda dispensers, but it wasn't horrible. The parking outside is terrible due to the design of the parking lot. It kind of criss crosses and makes getting in and out difficult.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea6acbb19b8fb3:0xdca871b45ace78b4</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I wish I could give this place 0 stars! they forget orders! I went in yesterday and ordered a broccoli soup and they told me I had to wait because they had to warm it up . It took them 40 mins! But I brushed it off because I'm a forgiving person but today I went in again and ordered the same soup and what happened? it took 40mins again for the soup! I was soo irritated I was about to walk out but one kind employee who was on his break reminded the people I was waiting on a soup then they apologized and claimed they forgot and gave me a free cookie but still that was 40mins wasted of my life I cant get back I will never go here again for the record.< /Text>< Pictures>

12/15/16 10:40 am. Horrible! Wanted one sandwich which wasn't complicated and had to wait 15 mins for the sandwich to be made. I wasn't to upset about that but annoyed. Then their register "froze" and I had to wait another 10 mins. Total of 25 mins waiting at this point (btw there were only two customers in line not like it was busy at all!)  But that wasn't my biggest problem, the employees having a bad attitude was. The girl at the register copped and attitude because her own register froze. Management should defiantly work with their employees on customer service. THEY NEED IT.  No wonder the tip jar was empty</review>

<text>Without a doubt one of the best coffee shops in Chico. They offer a variety of both hot and cold Blended drinks. Their coffee beans are roasted on site for the freshest and tastiest coffee in the area. The muffins and breakfast burritos are delicious. The folks behind the counter are pleasent and helpful. The owners are often on site and are cool and kind people. If Mel is roasting beans on your visit stop and say hi. He's a great guy.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_Rk0_ewhnnEBLZ5ibhq-19Xi0O3CwlRPzATpa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkTAI-bK-vvP8pdMvmrg81qOm1f0GIneyHyLpQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTi3RKoFiTKiS00JYx86gccP7NXSUYPqpSldeE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrVHTSZmTlTrXgceJcq4QM3nVvNS4CyfHzGaN-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNic83PvarwAEPJcEuGjbrcmnPTQA530cmIfB5H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ3RweNiHgBsT2o4EXixQjtTB0B0tusgCmG0hN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrcHBtw5KcF4uDDcsHSdM0gUPur2LBjZE-tSyk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

<text>There house brew is for those who appreciate good DARK flavored coffee.  The cashier, in my experience, is always helpful and polite.  I've never been disappointed with any of there treats or coffee. It's a great environment to have a intimate chat with a friend. It always smells delicious in there.<//text>< pics>

I was a regular customer for years but the owner freaked out on my friend because he said he parked outside the lines so we will not be back. Don’t need to get yelled at for spending our money there every day.  The girls are friendly and do an awesome job, too bad the owner is such a douche.</Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Locally roasted coffee with Fair Trade options make it a unique coffee shop in Chico. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 is because the breakfast burritos are not great. The beatnik burrito has corn in it... kind of weird IMO. Scones and pastries are great.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I went here right before my wedding day and gels peeled. I didn’t have time to fix them. Went in again and they re did them for free but 1 day later my index finger nail polish is peeling right off again. I have never had this issue before. It might be that the “gelish” polish is super cheap? Too bad. I don’t think I can go here again, it’s just  not worth the headache. They were definitely not very nice or apologetic about it either.<//Text>

Great acrylic nails - gel is the standard and they’re priced like regular polish ($55). I’m very tough on my hands and these have stayed on for three weeks already (all ten). I’m very impressed with the quality.<//review>

Decent job on my dip powder nails but way overpriced. A $25 pedicure should involve more than removing my old polish and putting another color on. No scrub, lotion, or anything. Their removal process for the dip powder was to soak my finger tips in a bowl of acetone for over half an hour. Could have easily been done with a filer and 10 minutes with cotton soaked acetone wrapped in foil like many other places do. It left my fingers feeling raw. For $50, you’d think maybe a hand massage or cuticle cut down: nope. Just removing the dip powder and putting it back on after reshaping. Disappointing. I will try another place next time.

Edit: have returned and gotten MUCH better service. It is a hit or a miss, just had to find the manicurists that I felt like met my needs. Eyelash extensions for a good price, too.< /Text>

<user>113676419465562628217<//user><text>Simon is the best! Quick and consistent, most importantly very easy to communicate how you want things and he can make it happen when you show him a picture. He really takes his time as a perfectionist, and double checks to make sure it is how you want. I also appreciate that he is so fast, i usually don't have acrylic because it's a time consuming process but now i found someone who do it really well in a reasonable amount of time. He's very accommodating as well!</text><gmapID>0x808587658737a1e5:0xb5dd42db879ac0e2< /gmapID>< Date>

Everyone is so nice and they do an excellent job. They are also in a great spot, right down the street from the N Judah line. Parking is tricky so I suggest looking on Lincoln St. 😉<//review>

This place was recommended for acrylics. Although my nails looked good the tools were kept in a altoids tin. The facility was generally dirty and I'm pretty sure the file was just a home depot drimmel. The lady actually referred to it as a drimmel but said it was meant for nails. In general defensive attitude. Not a great experience<//Text>

I have so many good things to say about Sunset Nails--Where to begin? First of all, the shop environment is so positive. There's a strong feeling of community and inclusivity. All employees are friendly and greet you with a smile. Ellen's attitude is out of this world. She is so kind and looks to have conversations with all of her clients. Secondly, I hear a lot of my friends complain about how there "are no salons in San Francisco" that are up to date on nail trends. While it has been difficult for me to find a place, I'm so happy I stumbled across sunset nails on Instagram. They have the most beautiful selection of chrome and sparkle powders you've seen. Personally, I went with an oval-shaped black nail--My go-to polish and style. Cindy did my nails and they came out wonderfully. Her attention to detail shows through. Thank you! I'll be back in two weeks 🖤< /Review>

<Review>Terrible work. Girlfriend had her nail done here 58$ single color no design. She had an appointment and still waited 40mins to be seen. They didn't sand them out or glue them close to the cuticle. I dont know anything about nails and I could see how bad they were. Dont waste your money.< /Review><user_id>106791691948950229495</user_id>< Rating>

Really disappointed with the service received. As other reviewers have mentioned, I think it depends on who you get and the technician I got for the deluxe pedicure didn’t seem to know what she was doing. Even though I called in early, mine lasted almost 2 hours for a pedi because she’d go somewhere else to either see other people / eat / just disappear. I specifically got the deluxe for scrubbing and all I got was a 2 minute harsh scrub with a hard sponge (which didn’t remove much of the calluses). I also had to ask the technician to remove the cuticles because she wasn’t doing them. It seemed like you should ask for the right technicians for a decent experience.</Review>

I was pretty disappointed with my visit here. I recently moved to the Sunset from Glen Park and am looking for a new salon to go to. I called ahead and was told acrylic nails would cost $40 but when I arrived, they told me it would be $65 (no special design or anything). I decided to get gel nails instead (for $30). Halfway through the service, the nail technician walked away and a different tech came to finish so the woman assisting me could begin a pedicure for someone else. I also got a pedicure which I timed, and it lasted a total of 7 minutes (from them rubbing off my previous polish to putting new polish on). No massage or anything was included. They were pretty busy when I was there, and I didn’t realize I was lucky enough to get a seat at an actual nail table. Two girls that came in after me had a towel draped over their laps and had their jails done on their laps. Don’t let the good reviews fool you, I would not return to this nail salon.< /Text>

today i visited sunset nails for the first time after reading other positive reviews, I was not disappointed. I was promptly greeted by the salon owner Ellen, who asked if I was coming in for a pedicure and fill with a smile (did she just read my mind?) Yes! My pedicurist and Manicurist, Diane, were both so friendly and took their time with my service. Diane took the time to make sure i was happy with shape and even took the time to show me how to eliminate some problem dry skin areas at home. Such wonderful service, not to mention my nails look fantastic and are just what I was looking for! thanks so much, I will definitely be coming back.</Text>

<Text>Super sweet staff, best acrylic/gel work in the city. I've been a customer of theirs since 2012, and I wont go anywhere else. Best stilleto, coffin shape nails, they have holographic glitter. Everything. Permanent eyeliner/brows available. All of your waxing needs covered. Ellen and Drea are thee best in the city for a full set of long, gorgeius, durable nails.  💜</Text><name>Jess Ward<//name>< Response>

I get my nails done very often and this haves to be the worst and dirtiest nail salon I’ve ever been to! I had an appointment and still waited an hour to get my nails done! And honestly it was done terribly I tried telling the lady to fix it and she got violent and threw her nail file on me unbelievable!< /Review>

The worst!!! I decided to treat myself to a pedicure a week before my due date and I called ahead to request the person that gives the best foot rubs. What I got was the worst pedicure I’ve ever had. The place was filthy, every chair was broken, they bring out a bucket to put your feet in full of room temp water . The woman didn’t even bother to trim or push back my cuticles and the whole pedicure took a total of about seven minutes. Complete waste of $22< /text>

<review>Went here because I saw all the great reviews after plenty of bad experiences in other nail shops, however I walked out wanting to cry, with a bleeding toe, a broken nail, and all of my finger nails shaved down thin to the last layer because they didn’t soak the gel polish i had on long enough and decided to just SCRAPE the living hell out of my nails. They had the audacity to try and charge me $50 for this.
WORST experience yet. Never coming back.</review>< Name>

I was looking for a place close by Judah to get a mani & pedi. After passing this little shop on Irving Street many times, I decided to give it a try. The owner was friendly and greeted everyone person like an old friend as they walked through the door, including me.
I was offered a hot cup of tea and a comfortable seat. The services satisfied my expectations and the fact that the ambiance reminded me of going into a small town barber shop, I was overall pleased and will most definitely return.< /review>

Went here without an appointment late on a Thursday night ( day before my wedding ) Very last minute.
They fitted myself and my mum in. Unfortunately the lady who did my nails was in a hurry so wasn't impressed as it felt rushed. Thankfully the owner stepped in and did her magic. Can't thank you enough. My nails looked lovely and the lady who did my Mum's nails was amazing too.
Next time i'm over visiting i'll be sure to come by.
Thanks again<//Review>

<Review>This is my first and last shopping trip since finding the right dress at this boutique. She'll look at you for a second and figure out what would look fine. The salespeople were friendly, knowledgeable, and made me feel special. As a result, I'll make sure to spread the word to everyone I meet!<//Review>< Rate>

<text>They are very attentive and always want to help with great attitude. I will always recommend this store to any girl out there. Oh what you find here you won't see it around, very unique too. Reasonable prices for something you won't see around and it fits you perfectly.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>5 stars! Best dress shopping experience ever for my 12 year old daughter. Total success! Great service!I came in to get a wedding dress, as an older bride, and the staff took one look and picked out the dress of my dreams.

Visiting this boutique was a nice idea! The selection was amazing, and the stylist who picked for the dress suitable for me was very talented, nice, and helpful. Eventually, the dresses and accessories displayed in their boutique were all captivating and elegant to look at. As a satisfied customer with the nice service I received, I will rate you a 5-stars. Thank you! Till next time!< /Review>

I love this Boutique! I've been shopping from them for 2-3 years now, and I am always so happy with my purchases. Whether I need something for a festival, holiday, and special occasions, this boutique has it all! Sofia, the owner, is also extremely helpful and has a great eye for fashion. I recommend this place for your fashion!< /review>

Fun to look through, just like anyplace else some stuff is pretty pricey. But the store is very well displayed, with theme's grouped together. We was there for the May Day weekend. Very nice visit.< /Text>

< Review>
Huge selection and nice staff. I highly recommend visiting here for some good local art displayed on shirts, sweaters, posters, and prints. Prices are good too, much less that competing shirt stores. Your looking at about $22-25 dollars per shirt. They also have hats and accessories. The online store has a generous selection as well and they give out free stickers and totes!</Review>

You should go here, not only for the selection and the curated clothes and jewelry, but because the owner really cares about her customers and is willing to go that extra mile to make sure they’re completely satisfied.< /text>

< review>
Don’t trust their pricing.  Very disappointed to find that this retailer overcharges.  I was visiting LA on Dec 24 and bought a pair of Mondo Mondo earrings for $335.00.  That evening I checked the brand’s own website to find that they sell the same earrings for a regular price of $290.00.  I flew home on Dec 25, but called the store on Dec 26th to complain.  The woman I spoke to verified that the Mondo Mondo website showed a price that was $45 less than Mohawk charged me. She said that she would speak to a manager and call me back.  She didn’t.  So, a couple days later I called again and a different woman I spoke to said that they sometimes charge more than  manufacturer’s suggested selling prices, that the operations manager was away until Monday, but that I’d get a call back on Monday.  It is Friday and still no call back.  Very poor customer service when there's a problem.  Edited to add: After posting this review, the store did call me back and refunded the $45.00 to my credit card.<//review>

I like their SMOCK line. Comfort fit, good quality at reasonable price point, and looks more like professional.</Review>

I was planning on buying a pair sneaker I found on their website, instead of shipping them I decided to walk over because I love supporting local businesses. The man standing by the register was beyond rude and made me and my mother extremely uncomfortable. We left the store immediately. I’ve always recommended people visiting LA to check out this store but I will unfortunately no longer be doing that.<//review>

The new men's store is awesome. The staff is helpful but not pushy and I got a pair of supercool wide leg denim trousers there (on sale!)  and a perfect pocket square. So happy to have somewhere in the neighborhood that sells grown-up clothes!</text>

The clothes are awesome, they have random little things like dope lighters etc, and the people are cool. Sure it's a little pricey for a tee or a cap, but it's local and represents CA .< /text>

<Review>While my personal experience with the store was less than ideal, the owner got involved personally and engaged with me to resolve the situation. The selection here is great and the merchandising incredibly unique. Nice to see a small business grow as the neighborhood evolves.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Inflexible returns policy.  Product purchased was faulty. Granted I didn't have my receipt, and we're talking about a low cost item here, but the point is I felt gypped and undervalued as a repeat customer. I've spent a not inconsiderable amount of money there. Will never shop at mohawk again.</review>< Name>

It was a quick visit I had some paperwork that needed to be in another town and this was the easiest way to get it done all in one stop.  It came out to $9.69 for my paperwork to get to san Jose. I think I really need to find someone who has a fax machine because I'd rather send any type important papers thar way.they even give you a confirmation aheet/recipe proving that you sent out
the paperwork .<//Text>

< Review>
London was AWESOME ! Super fast and efficient. I was able to print and send all my different returns for a low rate instead of running all over the place. She even asked if I had AAA so I would receive a discount. I will definitely starting going to UPS on Orangeburg instead if all the way to FedEx! Thank you, London !!</Review>

<user_name>Cates Cube<//user_name><Review>This place is very busy and NO one is forcing social distancing. I went in  for Notary first time based on reviews and the Notary did not help with understanding what we are signing like what is shown on Youtube videos. I do not know if this is the new norm or what. Not impressed being this is a UPS facility. I could have perhaps been better going to someone its their job to do Notary 24/7...</Review>< user>

<Text>I asked to send a package by regular mail and they tried very hard to up-sell me to their UPS service. After convincing them that I only want regular mail they asked for my phone number. I know they require that for UPS but USPS does not. They insisted they must have my phone number to simply send mail. They asserted it was required in case something goes wrong during shipment. I asked if they take responsibility for the package after the chain of custody changes from The UPS to USPS and they gave me a blank stare. The answer is obviously no. Once it is mailed USPS takes responsibility and UPS does will not take any action if something goes wrong. They just wanted to add my personal information to their system so they can market to me and lying about it to cover their true motive. Not cool.

The guy attending to me was very annoyed that I was questioning them at all. When I said I was going to the post office instead of using their service he muttered, "okay, good". He didn't care at all that he was loosing a customer for UPS and seemed happy to be getting rid of me.

So I went to the post office and mailed it. They did not ask me for my phone number or any other personal information other than a return address.< /Text>< Rate>

{'time': 1571957203282, 'text': 'I am sorry that you are annoyed with your last visit to our store.  If you needed tracking with your package, or if your package weighed over 13 ounces our system requires that we get your phone number when we create a shipping label.  We have different shipping software than the US Postal Service, this is why they do not need any personal information from you.  By having your phone number we can get in touch with you if any problems arise with your shipment.  Our goal here is to be able to provide our customers with excellent customer service.  Sometimes this requires having some of your personal information.  The only way you would ever receive any promotions or coupons from us is if we have your email address.  You would always have the option to "opt out" of these emails.'}</Resp>

<review>I have been doing business with this UPS store for several years using  the following services:
Fax machine
Shipping important documents that had to be tracked and signed for
Notary Public
Made my own copies
Had staff make copies
Shipping materials to an associate  or return to a business

I have been waited on several by several  different staff personnel, because my trips have been  few and far between. I am a first time customer to most of the employees I encounter. I have always had pleasant experiences because every employee who has waited  on me has been courteous and knowledgeable of all your services that I have used. I find your prices to be reasonable  ( with AAA and AARP membership) and the store to  always be properly staffed for the number of customers present. In other words the wait time is reasonable.< /review>< Resp>

Ridiculous fees of $3 document retrieval fee and $.15 per copy to send back Amazon packages.  Unfortunately after speaking to the owner of the store, she feels justified in charging a document retrieval fee like this.</review>

This is one of those places using a franchise name only to drag it through the mud, literally. It is raining, and I stood waiting for as they tended to those they knew over a walk-in, so I walked out.</Text>

<Time>1622332817657< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>A lot of rent to own companies have a bad rap for over charging. I guess in the long run you pay double the price. But, that is how Aaron's stays in business. However, you do have the option to pay same as cash price within 90 days. So whereas you don't have $1400 for a TV. But will be able to pay that within three months. It's great. Especially, I'd your credit isn't perfect.
The customer service I received was excellent. More than what I would expect. I believe it was the manager who helped me out the majority of my purchase. He was very personable and helpful. I will definitely purchase and rent to own from Aarons in the future.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1622568657842, 'text': 'Hi Angela Robinson, Thank you for the 5 star!

5 STARS FOR ATTENTION!
The new manager is VERY rude. I couldn’t fully ask nor say what I needed to say because she would cut me off. Especially on the phone she does not try to be helpful whatsoever. She hung up on me twice. Awful customer service from her. I had no complaints EVER before until this new manager came in. If anything the prior manager was awesome! Will definitely not be going back to this certain location.< /Text>

<Text>Wouldn't sell me a couch unless I bought the whole set.   I wasn't trying to lease it I wanted to buy it.  I guess this place is great for folks that need to lease short term or have challenging credit.   It was probably my mistake for not understanding the stores policy, but I did like the product, even though I wasn't allowed to purchase it.</Text><rating>2</rating><UserId.>112386952221588877991</UserId.>< Name>

The girl who answers the phone Alexa or whatever her name is, is literally no use to the company. She isn’t nice over the phone and seems to not know how to do anything. There’s been 2 time when I called to ask for help with something and she was totally dismissive and just saying I don’t know. My father called in and he got the same results. I went into the office once for the initial purchase and Alexa was the same didn’t know anything and not helpful at all. Now we have to wait for the manager to come in because it seems he’s the only one that has a brain.<//Text>

So I ended up having an issue with a Manger outside of the work place. He was a jerk and inconsiderate.  I called the place of buisness to let them know that one of there workers was wearing a shirt and representing the company and trying to smash in my car window and fight me. During the call I ended up getting nothing but crapy customer service. The manager  (who was the man trying to injure me) didn't give me the time of day or even talk to me like a human being. He was very rude and wasn't being buisness like what so ever. If you ever go to aarons watch out for a man in his 40's and about 6 foot. Chances are he will try and fight you and cuss at you if he isn't a fan off you. I would never shop at a place that a man can resprsent his company out of and try and bash in your window.< /Text>

My mom's hair was done to how she wanted but the hairdresser did poke her a few times. My hair was not done to how I wanted, I wanted softer curls with some volume on the front so my hair wouldn't fall in front of my face; I just got curls that I could have done myself, didn't look bad just not what I expected. My hairdresser kept hitting me with the curling iron well bumping it into me. I saw a lady get burned on the shoulder and their tools had a lot of build up of product. They were chatty to the point that they are not giving you their 100% attention.
Update
My sister in law was there too. My mom's and my hair were finished first and we left to get ready for the wedding. My sister in law later told me her hair dresser was negative, complaining about how much hair she had. To top it all, she burned her and told my sister is was the steam, that her hair was not completely dry. Total BS, she got a quarter size burn on her back.< /review>

<text>Very good food, at great prices and friendly staff.   They may have been a bit understaffed,  however.   The eggs Benedict were great, as was the chicken pot pie.  Dessert was strawberry short cake which was beautiful and yummy.  We'll be back.< /text>< Pics>

Stopped here for lunch, but ended up having breakfast, served all day. Belgian waffle with strawberries & whipped cream was very tasty. Wife had an omelette with pancakes. Also very good. Portion sizes are nice. Prices very reasonable.<//Review>

<review>Been here a few times now! Usually when going to and from the desert. And let me say that the food here is absolutely heavenly, and very worth the hype. If you find yourself nearby, I recommend it. My favorite dish they have is the Star B Ranch Buffalo patty. It's amazing!< /review>< pics>

We had the meatloaf diner.  At $15.99 it is way over priced and the food was not all that good.   The baked potato was small and not cooked all the way.  The corn on the cob was very small and no flavor.  The meatloaf was cut very thin and a little dry on the edges.  The salads were small.  The corn bread was a little dry and my wife's banana bread was not cooked at all and was like dipped in water it was so wet.  The meal was $34.45 for 2  plus a tip.   The value would have been half  on a good day.  We eat at Jenny's dinner in Highland CA and get the same  meal on the senior special for $6.99 and out the door for $15.20 including tax.  The salads are 3 times the size and nicer.  The potato's are 3 times the size, the veggies are always different and good.  The meatloaf is thick and not hard on the edges.  You can also have soup or salad.  The soups are good.  You get a nice dinner roll.  You get pudding or Jello for a desert.   You really get a good meal and they are not expensive on the entire menu.   The servers at grammas were very nice and spot on.  They are pushing $30 for a stake and it is not a stake house.   Sorry but it is way over priced and a 5 out of 10 on the food.   We travel all over the country and other parts of the world.  So much better food in LA and even at hole in the walls in the mid west.   Never going back.   I am over 70.<//Review></record>

<text>Food was delicious
But the waitress wasn't nice.  I asked for a small plate to put it under my coffee cup and she literally throw a nasty oval plastic plate on the table, my friend finished her breakfast and never got her pancakes.  Thumbs DOWN for the waitress.  👎👎👎👎👎<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>I walked in and immediately was welcomed by the friendly waitresses. Everything on the menu sounds good. Big portions great food fair prices. I was just cruising through on my way home from the casino. The interior really felt like you were in grammas kitchen. Chatted with some of the locals who were also so friendly. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!</text>< user>

Got the grandma's sampler and a mimosa. The mimosa was fairly strong and tasty for a 4 dollar mimosa overall pleased with it. The breakfast hash browns and home fries were actually seasoned and by far my favorite. The pancakes were fairly good, the syrup was basic. The biscuit and gravy, the biscuit was fresh baked and flaky but dense, but the country gravy was very bland. The service was subpar but when we saw the waitress she was very friendly, just a very busy place.<//text>

Great food and friendly service in a cozy farm house style restaurant. I've past by this place for 20 years and finally stopped on our way back from the Cabazon Outlets. I was impressed by the old school and contemporary menu including traditional breakfast and lunch items while also offering healthy options and even vegan and vegetarian dishes. Everyone was happy and full at the end of the meal. Will definitely return soon!</Review>

My favorite place to eat, but one problem only just make SURE your waitresses wear their face masks fully covered in their face and NOT under their nose. I had ONE that didnt but was willing to fix it. Thank you and keep up the good work let's keep your patrons safe and well fed.< /review>

<text>Given the name maybe I expected to much.  They were very busy and we were hungry, so we decided to sit at the counter.  I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs.  My plate came messy with gravy on the edges it spilled onto my sleeves.  The hashbrowns were way over cooked along with the chicken steak.  I only ate half.  Our waitress went on break we only knew cause we heard her tell another employee.  Didn't see another until we asked for check.  Will not be going again.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The restaurant was busy but we did get seated. But our waitress took a very long time to take our order. Other people who was seated around the same time as us got their order was taken and they got their food before we ordered. We had the waitress in the morning closer to the bathroom area.

<text>A unique gem in the area, and the menu options almost overwhelming; all day breakfast and lunch as well. We stuck with “Made from scratch” section: chicken pot pie and beef stew. Chicken pot pie: “awesome”. Beef stew: on the salty side but is hearty and filling. Apple pie: good! Four berry pie: so sweet it’s hard to imagine there’s no added sugar. Drinks: reasonable prices, $4 for wine/beer. With so many options to choose from and a “home made” feeling, there’s something for everyone here.

This place is definitely worthy of repeat visits. Daily special: Rib eye breakfast - huge amount of food - 8oz ribeye, choice of pancake (went with pumpkin-delicious!) 2 eggs, substitute potato for tomatoes. Cinnamon bun: super rich, heavenly when heated up. Service: consistently good.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSg7_BlNax-zVxdbbzCS5XvihbbLQB_x_LUhoS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ3fbQnxhmMyVlJYXYp0Dw5C1rMAQT6l5UmAxz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo5OMU_Edv_4oU3VHZbiHzjFdEGfiWLJrxba7o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXy5bk1CvkGsLhHeltAIqZlu6uGthVcANWQxAh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLuYP14TGzJlYslxizSPSoD2AJ7dHmtPXHhnPT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH_7ySUMIix5INf-0HCdYDLE4HJfasMt5pZ4cK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPLMUvX7vUPw6sfO1fvkMZ9MEeSRjtVSQJ4TWy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHwtM4EU-UuTenK5WOH4WRkdoG6JeAN_OJinZw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsD4yBpFK76hInxCKm5mCNot8FU4BJs7uGyCtX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Where should I start? The place was dirty. Then my wife and I ordered the Jumbo shrimp. I had the salad with ranch dressing. The small salad was drowned in ranch. The garlic croutons were burnt. My wife got the clam chowder. It was a dirt color and really thick. Her cornbread was ok at best. My garlic bread had the same consistency as my croutons. Then we got the Jumbo shrimp. Wow. What a disappointment! They definitely store bought and wer quite not the Jumbo size advertised. Small and cold just like my steak fries. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. One of those those places I'll never go back to.<//Review>

I went here for breakfast and it was so good. I had a regular breakfast plate which included Pancakes, Eggs, Sausage or Bacon, and hash browns. My favorite part was the pancakes. It was fluffy but it had a little too much butter but despite that, everything was amazing. Recommend this place if you are nearby.< /Text>

We loved this place the last time we went. Today, it was bad. Porterhouse steak was tough and thin, huevos ranchers was soggy and way too spicy, the biscuit was as dry as dust and the gravy had no flavor... something went wrong with this place...  disappointed we won't be back</Text>

My husband and I were traveling from Colorado and stopped at Grandma’s Country Kitchen and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. About 3 hours later he stopped for gas and realized he left his credit card. Calling in a panic I spoke to Cynthia who reassured me she had our card. Amen Jesus! She said she would mail it to us and send it express, I was about to tell her we would send the money back to her she said” don’t worry about the money for postage”
She saved us a several hour drive back to the restaurant. There are still honest God Loving people, ready to help others!
God Bless you Cynthia!!!

Grandma's Country kitchen was an awesome place to stop and have a quick meal before heading home. Place was busy but the servers were quick friendly and courteous.  I had steak and eggs for $12.99 and it was worth it. My friend had biscuits and gravy and she loved it. The pancakes for fluffy thick melt in your mouth.  Be sure and check out the cinnamon rolls, there's huge fluffy yummy goodness! I never in the area again it's going to be my one stop for another meal.< /Text>

I liked Grandmas Kitchen in Banning off of Ramsey across the street from the barber and saloon called the back alley i think..there are only a few good Mom and Pop shops or diners open amd still continuing there business as they should and there doing a fine damn great job and always wearing there face shields.they continuously check in on customers inside or outside and offer you hand sanitizer and ask you to keep your mask at hand and worn properly.</text>

Grandma's Country Kitchen
Definitely rated 5 out of 5
The cooks are top-notch the servers are excellent..
they're all very beautiful. -- and very friendly and they always make sure you get what you order and you get what you want.

And the baker she's a whiz she pumps out some good pies and some good cinnamon rolls and some awesome brownies.

You're on the 10 freeway going
EAST or WEST get off on the Sunset Avenue go to the stop lights and turn right and you're going to enjoy yourself and have a wonderful time</text>

Everyone pleasant! The staff was so courteous, even helped me take my 89 year old MOTHER & 😋 GRAMMAS bag to the car. Which was so full of delicious 2nds! The food lives up to the name!<//review>

<Review>Service was friendly and personable. Food was good, not too expensive. Nothing extraordinary but i didnt order anything too fancy either. Waffle, scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuit and gravy......pretty much what I expected.</Review>< date>

I was in the area and was starving. I found this country style restaurant. I ordered the BBQ tri-tip sandwich with BBQ sauce and potato salad and it was absolutely fabulous. For dessert, I ordered a slice of strawberry pie. It was absolutely delicious. This has a nice home style, cozy, quaint feel to it.<//Text>

Great staff and excellent food.  I stopped here on my way to Palm Springs.  I had the Machaca Omelette.  Plenty of food.  There was a good amount of meat in the omelette.  I would definitely come back and try more of their food.

Great decor too.  Very down home feeling.<//Text>

Wonderful atmosphere, lots of charming antiqaues and lovely old fashioned waitresses that call you 'hon'.

The food is amazing,  do try the cowboy soup especially.

A thoroughly charming dining experience.</text>

Absolutely delicious! They serve large meals that can actually be split between two people. The service was 100%! The servers are friendly, happy, and there when you need anything.<//Text>

The staff was friendly, but didn't really seem to understand the menu. I had the porterhouse steak, and it was the toughest piece of meat I've ever experienced. None of the staff wore face masks, and the onion rings were so over-done they could have been used as diving goals in a pool.<//text>

I was visiting my daughter in  Thousand Oaks , California and were on a family trip to San Diego. On our way back from San Diego to LA we stopped at this place for brunch. Cynthia, our server was extremely personable and caring. I enjoyed the basil and tomato soup in  Sour dough. Our party also got chicken and and waffles, the cod, tater tots and a whole range of other southern food. We were very happy with our experience and would love to come back<//Text>

I had the buffalo patty with eggs breakfast. The buffalo was dry and no flavor. My meal came with choice of biscuit and gravy and the gravy was watery and didn’t have a flavorful taste. The staff was very friendly!<//review>

<Review>Great food! My wife is vegetarian so she had several different cooked vegetables and I had the chicken fried steak.  The carrots and mashed potatoes are the best I've had.  Don't forget the homemade pies.  I had chocolate cream and will be back to get more soon.  Love this place.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
A very disappointing choice for breakfast.I thought this restaurant was similar to a Cracker Barrel or Po Folk's Restaurant, but got the surprise of my life!! The wait staff and old time decor was great. I even took photos of the decor, to show everyone where I had eaten. When my eggs, country fried steak, and home fries came out, but the fries were too crisp, my cfs was not cooked well, and eggs were not " sunny side up", I just couldn't eat at all!! I just left. Total disappointment.</Review>

<Text>The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The food is less than ideal. Do yourself a favor, instead of shelling out $25 for the Rib-Eye, stop by the grocery store, grab four for that price and take them home for grilling. You'll thank me later. The cut of meats used are low grade, under seasoned and tough. I hear they do a good breakfast and great pie though.</Text><user_name>Montie Whisner< /user_name>< rate>

So the reason why I'm generously giving 2 stars is because service was great, very amable and attentive otherwise I would've given 1. The food was bland and flavorless. Ordered a menudo and being Mexican it had absolutely no flavor or spices. Ordered honey bbq chicken wings also no flavor. Biscuits were a bit hard. I was expecting something more fluffy with flavor. Pancakes were okay.<//Review>

< Review>
*The food is good and their portions are large but DON'T order the meatloaf.. it was bland and tough. Not the old fashioned meatloaf cooked in a rich tomato sauce.
*Their biscuits and sausage gravy is very good (according to my companion and other customers.)
*The home-made 🥧 👌
We went on Easter Monday and enjoyed the beef ribs (on the menu) cooked in BBQ sauce and it was DELICIOUS 👌😋 an it fell off your fork. So tender and juicy.
The staff is kind, polite, and courteous.< /Review>

<review>Service was good . We had our toddler grandson with us and they brought his food out first which is always a good idea. When we got our meals the food was barely lukewarm. We sent it back and it was reheated. The flavor was underwhelming. Everything was bland. The prices are kind of high for the quality. We've been here for breakfast and always enjoyed that but I won't be rushing back for dinner.< /review>< Pics>

the food was excellent, in fact the waitress suggested to my wife to have the mashed potatoes with her breakfast! It turned out to be the bomb! The atmosphere is very cozy and the prices are reasonable, if you go there you have to try the cinnamon rolls 😋</Review>

First time here only one other customer ,that I could see. The food was good but the service was a bit slow. Had to ask twice for something. 4-5cars in parking lot but no one inside?? Plus all handicap spots were full just seems odd?< /text>

This place is my favorite place to eat in banning. They serve breakfast all day which is a plus. Anytime I'm on the 10 I have to stop here and I have been going here since I was kid. The staff is so friendly.<//review>

<text>Nice place. LOTS of bakery goods made in site. Tuna melt had grilled tuna patty. Cole slaw fresh and not over sweet as most are. Supreme nachos tasted much better than they looked. Fresh strawberry lemonade!

Chicken pot pie next time. Meat loaf sandwich too.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

Not only are the pies delicious but homemade. They're so tasty. The food is outstanding and big portions. The atmosphere is the best. I feel at home and so comfortable. The staff especially Gage, he is so sweet and attentive to his customers. I loved the experience<//text>

This is a very quaint place with very friendly staff. Food portions are huge, prices are very reasonable and the food tastes fabulous. Homemade food is so good. I had the pork ribs, my husband had the chicken pot pie made from scratch. Don't miss out on this gem of a place.< /text>

My family ate here tonight. I had the early bird roast beef dinner.  I had mashed potatoes, carrots, and a biscuit. I also had a salad.  It was very good.   The food was hot and I burnt my tongue. My dad had the early bird meatloaf dinner. He had cornbread, mashed potatoes, and salad with his dinner. He enjoyed his dinner. My mom had chicken pot pie and came with salad.   It was OK, but she prefers chicken pot pie from Corky's.  My brother had the Monte Carlo sandwich. He had macaroni salad.  My dad, brother, and myself had chocolate cream pie and my mom had blueberry pie.  I recommend this restaurant.<//review>

<review>Absolutely great experience. Very nice lady served us and the food was delicious. Their strawberries are super fresh and go great in their desserts and waffles/pancakes.

Their coffee is very good. They have fresh made pies every day. We always ask for the filling to be heated beforehand and it leaves the crust perfect!</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>Hostess was very nice and the wait was very short. The waitress was a bit more brisk. Food was good but didn't blow us away - for example the buffalo meat that was part of a breakfast entree was simply a buffalo meat burger patty. Husband (whose meal it was) said the meat was ok, but he was expecting something else, not just a burger patty by itself. The scrambles were very good though. They were very understanding of my requests with my children. The pastries we purchased to go were also good. We might give it another try for lunch or dinner.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This Saturday the place was busy but they sat us down relatively quickly. Once seated and we placed our order the food came out in no time and was hot and tasted fresh. The meal was (how do I put it) Excellent!!
It's a little out of our way but near an appointment we had so it won't be an every day selection but if in the area a must visit.< /review>

<text>This place is very nice and the food is good. I went there during breakfast and I was very surprised to see the menu had mamosas. I ordered one with my breakfast and everything was so delicious. I highly recommend this place.< /text><time>1553907507645<//time>< pictures>

Excellent service and food. Went back 1 month later. Breakfast is great but dinner a totally different story. For breakfast people waiting outside. At dinner only 2 cars in the parking lot at 7:30. Dinner was sandwiches that were dry,  very little meat, no taste. The other couple there were already eating. But it took 20 minutes to make 2 sandwiches. Nothing special but $35 bill. Wouldn't go to dinner there again.< /Text>

<review>I can cook canned food at home. Disappointed, and will not return.
My wife and I came to this restaurant to get a Saturday morning breakfast. This sounded like just the right kind of place for a satisfying meal. I was craving hash browns in particular.
The first disappointment was the coffee. It barely tasted like anything. I've had lots of diner coffee but this was among the worst.
I was really excited to find corned beef hash on the menu. I love it, love making it, and I expected that a "home-cooked" place like this might actually make their own. Nope, they upended a can of cheap corned beef hash on the griddle, flipped it over, and put the greasy mass on my plate. Second, my side of hash browns was really hard on the outside, yet dry and soft on the inside. How do you ruin hash browns?
We had more problems, as my wife's plate was unpalatable. Eggs scrambled with chips and chorizo is NOT chilaquiles. Thankfully, they did not make us pay for her plate or coffee, and we went to the Mexican grocery store down the road to get some decent food for her.
I'm giving Grammas Country Kitchen 2 stars instead of 1 because they tried to fix the problem with my wife's food and were polite about it, but we left very dissatisfied and will not return. Next time I want to eat canned corned beef hash ill buy a can of Libby's (not whatever can they bought) and cook it at home, where I can also get decent coffee.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic place to meet family and have a great meal. When I was younger we would stop there for their famous brownies....So good! Now that I'm all grown up, I have to compliment their service as well. Very rare is my coffee cup empty....and they clear the table as soon as they can to give the guests more room without feeling over crowded. Further, I have never felt rushed to leave like other establishments that are focused on table turning for the money making. Definitely a go to for me and my family.<//Text>

This was the first time I have ever been here and I will be returning. The staff was very friendly, and the food was delicious, very old fashioned restaurant. I loved how the place was decorated as well. Reminds me of eating out for breakfast in Oregon with my grandparents. We had great service,great food a great experience, even though it was busy our cups were always refilled,I couldnt ask for more</Text>

Yum! Lots of old-fashion items like pot roast on the menu. The breakfast I had was great. The place stays busy as a favorite both with locals and people who watch for it while traveling the I-10. Dessert menu rocks and sitting solo at the counter is fun.<//review>

We have eaten here quite often it's a great in between place for our family to all meet. Today for Father's day the hash browns were cold, my husband had eye toast and asked for it not to be cut and it came cut and was 2 heels so he sent it back and when it arrived it was not cut but was 2 heels again.  Who serves heels? My toast was so dried out that it just crumbled when I tried to bite it. Not real happy this time.</Text>

<review>We were driving through town and came across this gem!!  The atmosphere is super friendly, the staff is outstanding and of course, the food is delicious❤️

I want to make special mention of the staff. They are the best i have seen in any restaurant! They were slammed this morning but they were cheerful, efficient and highly attentive. On top if that they helped each other out and were playful with each other.

Love this place!!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Hubby tried the fish & chips & I tried the grilled cod. Neither of us liked it, the green beans were not cooked well either! I had the pot roast before & didnt like that either. The seasoning they use is just not good & too much! The breakfast is the only thing we both half liked! Probably wont go back!</review>

<text>Really cute place, vintage country decor but not kitschy, homemade sweets, friendly staff, and our food was served super quick but definitely good quality. Eggs Benedict were excellent  and you can choose tater tots as your potato! They were fresh, crispy, and fried to perfection. I had a lovely breakfast with my kiddo, who ordered an omelet and hash browns, which were also perfectly golden crisp.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80db43ee878f4615:0x481f1d2fe82fcdfb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It was tasty what we got.  Was in for a surprise when our bill came that they added a $1.99 for the avocado we had added. I new there would be a charge, but say how much.  We asked if we could do half fries and onion rings.  She said sure I can do that for you ladies.  Again$1.99 was added and didn't tell us.  It isn't all about the extra money. The fact nothing was mentioned.  Otherwise she was great and are burger was good.  Yes I will eat there again, but will have tater tots instead.</text>

<Review>Super cute!  Comfort food at its best. Worth the stop. I LOVED all the "feel good" quotes on the walls. Words that any Grandma would say to you to make you feel better. Never got to try the pie. I'll save it for my next visit.< /Review><user_name>Haley Stevens< /user_name>< pics>

Oh my goodness, this is my new place.  Its famous for it's breakfast but i tried on a dinner and it fit like no other.  The staff goes above and beyond on customer service and what's more is the genuine care and love that stands out! The food is wonderful the meat is a trip back in time...the meat, mashed potatoes and carrots takes you back many years and reminds you what REAL food tastes like.  Serving sizes are platter fulls.  dessert
Is equally family size. Bring your entire family and groups of friends because you won't be disappointed!</Review>

As soon as you walk in the front door, you feel like you've gone back in time to an old country kitchen that your own grandmother would have cooked all the meals from. The food there is outstanding and freshly made everyday. It is worth the experience to stop there and have a good meal.</review>

<name>Identity Tron< /name><Review>The 4 rating is largely because when you are in Banning, you really have to compare eating options to what's in Banning.  This would be a 3 for me elsewhere.  Having said that, the place has friendly service in a unique, homely atmosphere.  The clientele is mostly local salt of the earth type folks.  The food was good but if I was doing breakfast I would prefer Farmer Boys.  I also found the pricing slightly high.  Definitely worth a stop if you've never tried it or for the restaurant rotation if you are local.< /Review></record>

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was quaint and cozy. But the food was nothing to come back for. We got canned green beans add a side, yuck. I guess that would be what a gramma who couldn't cook would give someone. The refried beans were very dry. So sad cuz I always wanted to try this place whenever I pass it on the I-10.<//Text>

<review>At a Glance:
Food: 3.5 - 4.5
Service: 4
Convenience: 3-4
Value: 3.5 - 4
Bottom Line: This is a 4-4.5 star place in my book. Which is, on my scale, as good as it gets. A great spot for a home-style cafe/diner-type meal and experience that the chain restaurants in the area can't seem to match. With so many options this might be a place you can just come to and be confident you'll be happy.
.
.
The Boring Details:
Food:
Lots of the standard cafe/diner options are available. They seemed to have a lot of pie choices. We didn't have any this time. Had I not been so full I would have gobbled up a slice or two and wash it down with one of the big cinnamon rolls.
Everything we ate was good. The surprise for me were the potatoes. Great mix of flavors and a nice crust on the outside of the pillowy soft insides.  If it had a little more "crust" on it I think I could have just ate them by themselves.
Pancakes were big and filling. I initially thought that I wouldn't like them because they were so thick. I prefer them a little thinner. But they were good.
The only thing I thought was OK were the Biscuits. The texture was a little more crumbly then I like. So more of a preference then a true detractor since I'd eat them again.

Service: 4
The people we dealt with with were friendly and efficient.
Food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

Convenience: 3-4
Parking is ample and the location was easy to find. I also like that there is parking for RVs and larger vehicles. I hate finding food on the road. So having an option like this (other than a truck stop) when I'm pulling a trailer is pretty neat.

Value: 3.5 - 4
Dining out is getting expensive. There were a lot of great specials. So for the overall experience I think I found our new breakfast spot along the 10 corridor.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Love coming here for breakfast... Or lunch... Or just for pie! Four berry pie is my favorite and I love how it's naturally sweet, no added sugar. Banana cream is amazing, kids love the French apple. Food... It's all good. We're vegetarian now but when we did eat meat my husband loved getting the club sandwich, the Monte Cristo is good too. Pancakes are always delicious. Seriously all the food there is so good. My one and only issue is not seeing all the charges on the ticket, I know it's a small paper and we have a lot of food on there but I always check our ticket and I can't seem to get it to match up 9 times out of 10.< /Review>

we've never been to this restaurant before I saw that there was a lot of cars in the parking lot and we thought we would give it a try. Wow what we impressed. Great country home atmosphere and food to match.</Review>

<review>Grammas Country Kitchen is a great go to breakfast/lunch/dinner spot right off the 10 freeway.  If you are traveling to/from the Joshua Tree or Palm Springs area from/to LA and are in search of a good home style meal, look no further, this is your place.  Good open faced sandwiches, meat loaf, fixens and more.  Don't leave without having a piece of freshly baked pie!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Looks great and inviting BUT no wait, service acted too frazzled and both of our meals were cold not warm!!!
As we waited we over heard the server complaining about cut in servers.

In answer to my Facebook post, we aren't the only ones complaining...
Sorry</review>

Been here before and it was great. This last time the food was very blan. Maybe it was an isolated incident.  The service is great. I love that they are not afraid to show American patriotism! And they have scripture on the walls!</text>

<Review>Unfortunately the option of less than a star rating isn't available, and they would only get that high of rating based solely on the environment and service, which was excellent. But the food they're serving is NOT EDIBLE !
The menu is really awkward and contradicting considering it's supposed to be a "country kitchen".
Food on silverware, chipped cups filled with club soda instead of Coca Cola, food was cold, everything (and I mean every bit of "food" on my plate) was undercooked and ridiculously salty to the point that a salt lick does not even compare..
Which is probably why they had every condiment you can think of on the table to try to unsuccessfully mask the flavors of what they're serving.. my husband and I actually wanted to throw up the moment we walked out.
I wouldn't even serve that food at a soup kitchen, due to the incredibly poor, unhealthy and inedible quality of food.</Review><Date>1556380473866</Date><userid>112381221784317340560</userid>< user_name>

<text>The food is pretty good county cooking, with big portions, so big in fact that I couldn't try the pie. The decor perfectly captures the aesthetic of my aunt's living room, which is to say it's got a lot of county tchotchkes and none of the wallpaper matches. It's a pretty rare find in southern California.</text><gmap_id>0x80db43ee878f4615:0x481f1d2fe82fcdfb< /gmap_id><rating>4<//rating><pictures>None</pictures></record>

The cost  $ 15.00. One of my friends got a Ortega burger with side of salad, coke and pie with ice cream all for the tune of $22.00. No wonder their not as busy  as they use to be. We're sure not going back !!!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80db43ee878f4615:0x481f1d2fe82fcdfb< /gmap_id></record>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Drove in from AZ to buy a truck at Diamond Hills dealership. The salesman recommended Grammas. He was right. It is a locally owned restaurant with a quaint atmosphere. Home-made comfort food served hot. Our order came faster than we expected. Being from AZ I didn't anticipate or expect Banning would be as chilly as it was in May so I opted for the bread bowl of chili with cheese and onions to warm me up. It was delicious. The bread was just the right amount of crustyness (if thats a word) and it was perfect. I brought back a strawberry rhubarb pie which was made that day. Another delicious selection. I recommended Gramma's, and if we are in the area again I won't hesitate to stop. Its right off I-10; so easy to get to.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Great service, Great food, we were staying in town for a couple of days and found Grammas online and visited based on ratings. Seemed to popular with locals too. The only thing I didn't like was the Orange Juice, I wasn't expecting fresh, but it wouldn't recommend it.

The place is cosey and includes baked goods at the register.< /text>

The chicken fried steak was great.  We also tried the chili Colorado omelet which was okay...the meat inside was tender and juicy however the meat on top was dried out and the juice was really oily.< /review>

What a great find!  We were on our way home after spending thanksgiving at my mama's house, half way home we stopped for a bite.  Denny's was packed, so we stayed on surface streets and found this little gem! The food was tasty, the helpings are big, and the service was great!<//review>

< review>
This review is for breakfast only. The first time I drove by Grammas I was hooked. The stagecoach in front and the western architecture is right up my alley.  The inside continues the western theme and the wait staff are dressed accordingly. Very friendly.  They have a large selection of items on the menu, unfortunately the food is basic, borderline mediocre. A little pricey compared  to other restaurants in the area. Nice people,  great surroundings,  food.....basic.</review>

< Review>
Now I am a grandma of 10 little ones myself and I must say that I would never serve them the food that comes out of this place. Let me start by saying that the soup I ordered with my dinner never made it to the table so I cannot rate the soups but my meal was just horrible. The rice was sour and when I told the waitress she gave me this look, a look as if she didn’t know whether to believe me. She said that she would have the cook check, she didn’t even take my plate off of the table until she checked with her cook! Extremely disappointing and unprofessional. In all my years. In any light , the second plate of food came out cold as if they just threw something together to give to the “complaining customer”. Well honey, now I am complaining because the prices are too high and not only is their attitude but my plates gone cold or was never warm to begin with. My friend Betty who was dining with me that evening said her food was tasteless and lacked effort but she took what was left to her pup. My coffee had grounds in it and there wasn’t any creamer on the table. The “homemade” pies I learned are indeed not homemade because I overheard the young man ask if he should bring pecan pie out, I am assuming to add to the display case and the lady at the register told him he should but to make sure that he unwrapped them in the back because they are supposed to be homemade! Unbelievable ! We paid and left very unsatisfied and will not be returning. Grandma , get your house in order!< /Review>

I'm surprised to hear negative reviews.

We went with our family today for lunch.  I had a French Dip and it was delicious!  The portion was huge, the meat was cut well and no fat (which is more than I can say for a certain casino that we paid way to much for a fatty disgusting sandwich).  The service was great, and the kids loved their meal.

I would definitely come back.<//text>

<text>A little pricier than expected, BUT the food was yummy, the staff was down-to-earth and friendly, and the service was FAST!!  We wanted for nothing; we didn't have to wait for beverage refills or anything else we asked for.  Our server, Angie, was right on point, and deserves a gold star!!  We are looking forward to returning again.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>We stopped to get slices of pie to go.
Big mistake! Do not go here for pie!!
The banana cream was pudding!
The crust on the apple a blackberry tasted like store bought raw dough. The fillings are were from a can. A few bites each and they went in the trash! Terrible!!!!!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80db43ee878f4615:0x481f1d2fe82fcdfb<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>Home style cooking as you would expect. You get plenty of food on your plate so you won't go home hungry. Homey pleasent atmosphere, not modren. Prices are medium high, at least for me. I would recommend it if you are in the area.<//review>< rating>

I always loved coming here when I lived in the area. It's better than any IHOP and Denny's, this is really the place for a great breakfast with an extremely friendly staff. The women here always are quick and chipper. I make sure to stop here everytime I'm heading out and passing by.< /review>

Prices are different compared to what's on the menu. Add an extra $2 - 3 and that should be accurate to what's on the menu at the restaurant. Service was great and food was good.<//review>

What a cool place... the food was great, the ambiance is comfortable and the staff are fantastic!

My ribeye was cooked perfect and overall my meal was 5x5.  To top it off, my server was a hoot.... funny, informed bubbly and expert in what shes doing.... Her name is Coni and shes a riot....   if you go there for chow, ask to be seated in her section...  what a blast!!!<//text>

<review>It may have been just my plate....I got the El Taco omelette.  It was just nasty.  The meat in the omelette was dry.  There were corn chips in the omelette but they soggy and greasy and tasted old.  The refried beans were good.  The biscuits and gravy are not good.  The gravy tastes like it's from a package.  The biscuits were hard and dry.  I had grits but they were instant.  Almost no flavor.  Coffee was good and the staff were friendly.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I wasn't impressed, biscuits and gravy was just that, no sausage and the biscuit was hard, dry and tasteless,   I could barely cut it with my fork.  The biscuit had been there a couple days for sure.  They got one star because the chicken fried steak was good.

The restaurant was busy, the waitresses didn't check on how the meal was. We had to grab her to tell her about the bisquits.<//Text>< name>

Their Sandwiches and other foods might be good But we had a very bad experience with ordering FIsh. We had ordered Trout and  Grilled Cod fish.   Trout was tasteless and Cod was not grilled it was like bakes and row.  I had an international guest and did not want to complain till I see he is not eating his fish and eating the side food, which I was doing the same thing. I asked him and he said it was not good, no taste and not baked good.  I told him mine was tasteless, too. At that time an older waitress was passing by and I told her what it is. At the same time my son told his food is bad. The mashed potato was watery and lost in the gravy they dumped on it.  So, she took his plate firs and told us she will let our waiter know. Our waiter came and was mad because we did not tell her but we told that to other waiter. She took our plates and came back with nothing saying sorry you ate half of the plate. My guest did not touch his fish other then I tried tase it to see how bad it was.  He ate rice and other side dishes. I ate some part of my fish with souce to be able to make it tasty.  At the end we paid and left as hungry and taken advantage and mad. I would not go there again. Manager lady was a cold face just saying fake sorry.   Never have fish there, if you do make sure it is cooked your taste.< /Review>

Good "comfort" style food.  Large portions.  Prices are typical California increased.  Higher minimum wage means higher restaraunt prices.
Great baked goods.< /review>

Saw the sign on the freeway while heading to Palm Springs, so we decided to get off and see.
With a covered wagon out front we pulled in. Walked into a cute country restaurant. The place was very pleasant.  I ordered a California omlette with crispy hash browns and pancakes. I couldn't finish it. Gotta say that this place is a good to come anytime. Friendly staff, good food.
Biscuits and gravy that my husband ordered were good too.</Text>

We were greeted at the door by Jonathan and seated promptly.  Our waitress jeanna was very polite.
Ordered the stuffed pork chops and the shrimp plate. Food was very tasty.</Review>

<text>Wow! I stopped in for lunch and was served a meal that was as good as my childhood memories of my Nana's cooking!  I  tried the Salisbury steak, it was tender and savory. The gravy was light but hearty, and the mashed potatoes were REAL with lumps and everything! And when was the last time a cooked vegetable came on the plate? Most restaurants give you a salad and figure that's the vegetable!  And did I mention that I had a choice of 2 vegetables or a mix of both? The staff was very helpful and friendly!  Thank you Gramma, I will be back again and again!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Food was just ok nothing special.  The service was the worst I ever experienced.  Waitress took about 20 t finally get to table.  Had to wave her down for little things like silverware and she acted like I was imposing on her.  Cashier was just as bad.  I will never return!< /Text>

<Text>Nothing special.  Order came to us wrong. Ordered the western bbq cheese burger. Came with nothing on it. Also had asked for medium well and was well. Also had a hair in my food. They were very apologetic and gave me a free shake. Service was ok. Had asked for another straw because mine had broke and never got another one. I wouldn't go back.
The fries were amazing and the shake was very thick which is a plus.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The staff very hospitable,  from Jonathan who greeted my husband & myself. He helped seat us,place R w/c's with respect for us. Amazing Jonathan, he was very helpful with all R needs. Coni, R server went beyond her serves also. Even to the taking R doggy box, & R DELICIOUS PIE to R vehicle. The atmosphere was set as We would of been in Great Grandma house. The food choices had many down to country STYLE . The food AMAZING.  The prices R fair in most of the choices. Everyone, including the Cleanliness was SUPER! Bathroom was very clean as most restaurants have had very poor service.  Thanks to ALL the STAFF.  We felt home. Even the other guest were pleasant . Wil we Return? YES.  We have already shared R pie with family & friends. We did boast slightly about the home cooking, and the feelings of being at Grandma's house.  R family & friends R excited about making it a choice of their own to vjsut Grammas Country.. God Bless. Also the Greeting of The Prince of Peace when we entered was above all A BLESSING.  Again Thank U. Only negative was that more staff servers R needed.  The staff was actually running table to table. Good food and Great People.. We will certainly will be coming back. WALKING WITH JESUS.. THIS FAMILY..</review>

<review>Inside has a country flair. Service was good. Was disappointed in the food. I can't believe they brought the chicken to the table that was so fried there was no meat, just breading and bones  The waitress brought us another 3 pieces but the damage had been done. . Omelette was overcooked and dry. Biscuits were hard and dry and gravy could not even soften them up. I was excited about trying this place after all, grandmas kitchen how can you go wrong. My burger was ok but then again it was a burger. Pricey for what we got.   i'm tired  of the totally commercial restaurants and was looking forward to this place.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

Worst porterhouse steak ive ever had, tough and chewy. Not worth 25.99 for sure! Rib eye was tough and tasteless. Eggs were good. Wait staff was friendly.< /Text>

My husband and I went to lunch there today. Atmosphere nice and comfortable. Service good until our waitress went on break. Food - horrible, I had the french dip sandwich and the meat was so dry it was like eating jerky. I was very disappointed as we had driven 64 miles to get there!</review>

The Steaks are amazing! Homemade mash potatoes and soups are too ❤️ Most friendliest warm servers you'll ever know or meet.... For breakfast they have huge crisp waffles, fresh diced home fries, and the chile verde omelette is pretty good too... Lunch has amazing sandwiches, the Az sand so so good!! Or the huge Philly or hot pastrami  with fried green beans  & very goo<//review>

Food is ok, but way overpriced for the quality and portion size. The desserts are the best part. Service today was frustratingly slow, but on other occasions it has been good. We keep giving them more chances, but I don't think we'll be back.</Review>

< Review>
I'm shocked by the positive reviews. Angie was our server and was outstanding. The food was dreadful. They promote "homemade" but use "" because clearly most of the food is not.

We had tater tot appetizer and those were fairly good. My wife had the monte cristo and the turkey tasted rancid. I had the Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes. It was luke warm and had no flavor at all.  I figured the biscuits had to be good right? Wrong. Dry and flavorless even the jam they served with it had no flavor.

The place is old but clean. Needs new flooring.

We read the reviews and were excited to try it because we love comfort food. We were very disappointed.  They need to cut the menu down by 50% and focus on making authentic fresh made comfort food with some flavor.

We are not harsh food critics. We like simple fresh food. Our experience is quite different than what most of these reviews say. The staff however is exceptional.<//Review>

I ordered  a ham dinner with all the fixins for a family of 10 for Easter , everything was fresh and delicious and the price was right and the staff was wonderful they carried everything to my car.
And the dinner came with the best bananna creme pie ever!
I will be using them again for a big family dinner!<//review>

< Review>
I got the fried chicken, thinking it would be homemade, but it tasted like Walmart fried chicken. My daughter had the ckichen pot pie, it was so bland she couldn't eat it! The service was good but the food was very disappointing and over priced. I will not be returning.< /Review>

< Review>
Eating at Gramma's was EXACTLY what we needed! After theme park food and several hours of traffic jams and delays Gramma's really hit the spot. All 5 kids/adults had several desirable options and everyone was happy with their food. We are left feeling full and satisfied, ready complete our journey. We will definitely keep Gramma's in mind for our next trip.</Review>

<text>I really enjoy eating here. The food is always good and the service is friendly.  I've only had breakfast and lunch and enjoyed both very much. They serve all the traditional  favorites. I've had the pancackes and they certainly like the onrs grandma  use to serve with lots of butter and syrup - so good! And they serve the good bacon! Nice,  thick,  and crispy - like it should be.
The sandwiches are good to. I had the club sandwhich and it was served with real turkey and once again the good bacon. Im hoping to try the dinner selections next time im here, hopefully  soon. I almost forgot, the pastries are to die for! I brought home some brownies, cinnamon rolls, and cookies last time and everyone was happy. Ya i broke the bank on that visit. But it was well worth it.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>But if you order a "Medium Well" hamburger, and get the half lb instead of the quarter lb, specifically bc it's described as being more "juicy", server won't tell you it "always gets cooked to Well, you should have ordered Medium" unless you ask them after the fact you get your (dry not juicy) hamburger.<//Review><user_id>117646107002905709162< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Dashed into Banning for some fuel and saw this unique, inviting local fav with a parking lot full of cars.  Walked inside to an adorable,  family friendly,  definitely like grandma's house kinda place.  The staff was great,  very attentive.   If this review was only about the staff and building it would be 5 full stars,  but, lets get real..we stopped for food.  There was 4 of us.  Dinner and dessert...over $100.00.
We ordered two Ribeye's, one chicken sandwich,  drinks and dessert.   The drinks are large and generous,  great value.   The steaks were not like the drinks...left 3/4 of them on the plate due to fat.   The chicken sandwich's bread was too soggy to eat..so, you guessed it.  Left it on the plate.  The pies...hhhmmm, we were a bit puzzled.  Was it Coconut or Banana??  None of us tasted coconut....All we tasted was instant pudding...in banana flavor.  Sorry Gramma but my next trip to Cali will not include a visit....  :  (< /Text>

Reasonable, good tasting family style casual friendly worth stopping for American down home friendly cooking owned by former waitress and cook purchased from a real Gramma probably. They do early bird specials for steakhouse dining BIG LIKE from me who always cleans my plate that is I like to eat good tasting honest and freshly cooked fare.</review>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) Excellent restaurant with traditional cuisine, as an alternative to the usual fast food. Huge and well cooked dishes, so much so that we had to take the doggy bag for leftovers. Friendly and professional waiters, all at a more than affordable price (35dollars), however much less than 2 burgers in any Californian restaurant.

Ottimo ristorante di cucina tradizionale, in alternativa al solito fast food. Piatti enormi e ben cucinati, tanto che abbiamo dovuto prendere la doggy bag per gli avanzi. Cameriere gentili e professionali, il tutto ad un prezzo più che accessibile (35dollari), comunque molto meno di 2 hamburger in un qualsiasi ristorante californiano.<//text>
