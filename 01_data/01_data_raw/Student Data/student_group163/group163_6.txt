<rating>5<//rating><Review>Lovely little coffee shop in Scott's Valley with delicious coffee, delightful pastries, and friendly baristas. They knew their regulars well, which is always a good sign. They had a lot of food too, not just coffee. They serve Lulu Carpenter's coffee here, which I had never had before, and their espresso was very nice, bright, bold, with a hint of berry (to my taste buds at least).

My wife loved her latte with whole milk, which she usually sweetens but didn't and still really enjoyed. Her breakfast bagel was also very good. My cappuccino was bright, the espresso strong, and the oat milk (Oatly Barista) paired well with it. I also ate a Lemon poppyseed with lemon curd muffin which was really nice and moist. Such a lovely way to start the day.

Highly recommend checking it out. Plenty of outdoor seating too. Followed all Covid guidelines.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMGh2q3VloURmobFiUUHLdVHBrk2FJD4afOjpU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM57_ER8s9NnA2ZQOGEFO2QMTQNfe6glzoqPNtS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJLq193M2R-mIg3FYU8D90II2GTxF-RY4ohss-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

I Love Coffee!!

So driving to Santa Cruz and had a craving for coffee so yelped this place and seemed like great reviews. Decided to check it out. Parking out side was a breeze. Plenty of parking available. Walking in the store has a nice coffee smell. Everything in the shop looks clean and professional and organized. Felt like a homey coffee shop.

There was a group of 7 of us and we all got our own special coffee. For the 7 of us the barista did a very fast and accurate job and even made foam prints on our lattes (unfortunately forgot to take a picture). I personally got the coconut syrup hot latte and my fiancé got the same thing but iced. The quality of the drink was acceptable.

1 small downside.  Not sure if they don't provide it or if they just didn't have any when we were there but they didn't have any hot cup sleeves. When I asked she kindly offered a second cup which was nice.

Overall expensive was definitely a 5 Star. And if I ever catch myself in this area again. Will be coming back<//Review>

Nice atmosphere and comfortable with plenty of seating. It's too bad the coffee is awful. I drink 2-4 cups a day, from 7-11 and Folgers to Black Rifle and Philz, and I always finish my cup(s). This is one of the few places I've left my coffee unfinished, it's that bad.

Otherwise it's a pleasant experience with nice staff and a decent spread of quick bites.</text>

Fast and friendly service. Clean interior. Tasty food and most importantly well made espresso and espresso drinks. Coffee Cat is part of Lulu Carpenter's, a long-standing local company which has several cafes in Santa Cruz. In my experience they have been making excellent coffee for decades. Their shops may not be as big or modern as some third-wave cafes but the coffee is just as good...and perhaps a bit less expensive as well. If you're headed in or out of Santa Cruz and want good coffee off of Highway 17 check out Coffee Cat.<//text>

Make the best soy lattes EVER & the staff is ALWAYS friendly. Contemporary interior; always
clean. Free latte w purchase of reasonably priced quality 1lb club-roasted coffee beans: great man-gift. Upgraded food choices last year: awesome bacon-wrapped egg with goat cheese! I always leave with 2x peanut butter/ choc swirl cookies; never a problem (note: we stop here 1-2x/mo).< /Text>

They had lavender!!! Yes! Frothed to perfection, beautiful pour and great color on the espresso! Very nice place!
My only concern was that the steaming wand had burnt milk on it and the steaming pitcher had dried up milk stuck to the side. But hey the flavor was good! And they're better than Starbucks!<//Review>

<review>Coffee is really great. Service is not so great.
Out of 5 visits, 3 times I waited more than 20 minutes for my order of one single item. 2 of those 3 times, my order was lost and forgotten, then made after I had aleeady been there too long. Great coffee. Not worth the wait.< /review>< GmapID>

< Review>
I sadly misjudged Coffee Cat for many months and titled my nose as I drove past to visit Starbucks and Peet's for my regular coffee & work sessions. But thankfully the coffee gods did not give up on me and recently guided my vehicle to Coffee Cat.

Boy have I been missing out! Upon walking in I was excited to see a very spacious seating area with nice wood tables and way less people than the other big-name coffee shops. They even have power outlets along the entire wall for all those seated along it - amazing! The wifi is also very good and the bathrooms are decently clean.

And to my even greater surprise, they have a Clover!! I love coffee pulled from a Clover, always my first choice if available which is rare. Their other coffee selections are also very good and the ladies really know what they are doing behind the counter. They also have a great food selection with healthy, authentic ingredients. And if that isn't enough, Safeway is right next door - very convenient.

Overall, I am very impressed with Coffee Cat and have directed all of my coffee funds and work sessions here. Thank you CC!</Review>

The music was way too loud to focus on work or reading if you’re interested in staying inside. When I asked if the music could be turned down the cashier said yes but then never turned it down. Plus the coffee is overpriced.</Review>

Best damn coffee in Santa Cruz. Seriously overtly flavorful beans for home brewing. And the baristas make espresso drinks quite well (where as many good roasters's product is best enjoyed made at home in the Chemex).
I absolutely love the 1 and 1.
I also haven't received the stereotypical pretentious attitude often given at high end cafes.<//review>

I was happy with the roomy atmosphere, lots of places to “hunker down” in peace and quiet and do things on the Internet.

Best coffee I've had in a long time. Modern space, a little sterile of a spot but my coffee was so good I would definitely come back again!!!</review>

I always feel like the baristas are nice and welcoming. They always greet customers as they walk in and really love their foam art. Great coffee and really good muffins and goodies.</review>

Buy a bag of freshly roasted coffee and I mean "freshly" roasted and you will get any coffee beverage for free. Love this place.</Review>

I usually go in the Morn when it's less crowded, masks are required to enter, NO MASK=NO ENTRY! They have made it clear that masks are required at ALL TIMES while in their facility! Would have gave it 5 stars if they did Temp checks as you come in... Never too late to do the right thing....</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This is a LOCAL gym COMMUNITY ran by Southern San Diegans. ✌🏿

The atmosphere in this gym is particularly...INTENSE. It's boo tho. 🐐

The gym 🐀 take their workouts seriously and expect the most out of all members.
If you come to this gym...make sure you ACTUALLY WORKOUT.

This 24's members IN PARTICULAR strive for perfect health.
There is a CULTURE of athletic prowess and betterment.

The men here build greatness.
If the body is a temple this is gym is the harvard of craftsmanship.

During dark days -  spent upwards of 6 hours here pushing my mind, body, and soul to it's upper limits and was actively challenged and motivated.

Time seems to slow to a crawl here.... It truly is the GO TO hyperbolic time chamber 💪🏼

The people giving bad reviews were prob never  invited to the cookout 🤝

Favorite 24 hour in SD. 🔥💦

ATTENTION 2 DETAIL. Try your hardest and learn from the old heads, and athletes.

<text>I am an out-of-state student, but I live here in San Diego full time. I signed up for a 3-day-free-trial pass online to see if the 24 Hour here was a right fit for me. Upon coming to the gym, and presenting the pass I had already gotten through their website, the employee told me I could not use the pass due to the fact I don't hold a California state driver's license. I told her I was a student and could present her my student ID as a form of state identification, to which she went back to talk to the manager. They both denied me of my free-trial pass, but said that they could sign me up for a membership instead. How does it make sense that I could sign-up for a paid membership without a California state ID, but not a free-trial pass? Since my roommate and I had already driven over there with the intention to get a workout in, I complied and signed-up for a membership...which was $38 "waiving the initiation fee and first month free." About two weeks later, my other roommate (who is also an out-of-state student) went to this same location with a free-trial pass and she was greeted with the same message, "sorry we can't give it to you if you don't hold a California issued ID." Again, my roommates explained that we live here full-time and that this policy doesn't make sense given that there are 24 Hours in the states presented on our license. The same employee that denied me of my free trial GAVE MY OUT-OF-STATE ROOMMATE her 3-day-free trial pass. I feel that it is too late now to try and get my money back, so instead I am writing this review.<//text>< Rate>

It can need a bit more maintenance on workout machine usage bc they break down a lot but the members there use it heavy, hard and often. So I understand. During covid times, I do miss my sauna sessions a lot. The staff are quite fine, never had a problem. The grittyness of it all makes it feel comfortable to get down and sweaty when you want to. 😊<//Text>< Pictures>

<date>1565384138050< /date><review>It feels like no one cares about this facility. Pretty much every time I'm in the group room using the cycle, I see someone use the cycle, then proceed to not clean it or put it away. The color coded weights are just put back carelessly in disarray, and the step up platforms are put away so no one can walk through the equipment room. Not only is is frustrating that the customers don't seem to care about the facility, there's little evidence to suggest staff help keep it clean either. This is a community, let's be considerate of others. Not only that the showers need remodeled. They need shelves in the shower because I'm not putting my shampoo and body wash on the floor. I mean we pay an annual fee to keep this place up, why is it in such bad shape<//review>< rating>

<Text>Been a member for probably 2+ decades. While the gyms have always been clean, I can honestly say I have never felt safer, at least at my gym here in Lemon Grove.  I only wish they'd open up 1 hour earlier, at 4am, so I can go before work like I always used to.  Otherwise, I'm glad they're open again.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Best gym ever!!  It's open 24 hours. This means you can go whenever you actually have the time and nobody cares that it's 3 a.m.. it's available and they want you to come and use the gym! Or to swim if that's what you want: 24-hour swimming pool with six Lanes which is only unavailable three times a week for one hour for the water aerobics class. Your membership spans whatever City you're in, too.</Review>

Fairly certain the locker rooms have never been cleaned - its disgusting in there. I see the staff laugh when the announcement to clean comes on. For the amount of people and lack of cleaning that goes on here its a bio-hazard. If you don't mind getting a staph infection get a membership here!< /review>

Staff does not monitor the club for idiots and seems to allow people to bring in their own speaker and play it to the point that it can heard through headphones. There is plenty of weight at this location, unfortunately, if you are trying to find anything less than 25 pounds most of them have been stolen. Today there was only four 10 pound plates available in the whole gym.< /text>

They have a pool, sauna, and a steam room which I always consider a huge bonus. The free wights and equipment are about a generation old however they are well kept and in good working order. This gym is not dirty but it is not as clean as it could be which is my only real complaint. However with all things being considered I certainly recommend this gym.< /text>

My first time at this gym was yesterday and it wasn't bad. The staff seems pretty cool too. Most of the people were in the free weights area as if there was a big meeting over there but the machines were clean. I don't really car about the age of the machines as long as they do what I need them to do.
I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 due to the music from the overhead, LOL........plus I forgot my headset at home</text>

This 24 is alright. Nothing special though. It does get very crowded and the bathrooms are pretty nasty. If you avoid the busy hours then it's not too bad. Equipment is a little bit older when compared to other locations. As far as management I don't have much to say because I rarely interact with them. I wouldn't go as far to say they're rude but I wouldn't necessarily say they're friendly either. If you can, try other locations.<//Review>

I live near this site, but used the La Mesa branch near Helix High because I could actually get a machine and finish a workout. They closed that branch so I'm stuck with this one. Even though the other was old, it was well maintained. This one is dirty and 1/4 of machines don't work, so it stays crowded. Please do something about this, or open another to alleviate the overcrowding. I gave up and use my own home workouts.< /Review>

<Text>One thing I really hate about this gym is the steam room closing at 11:30 pm. They have a sign that says 11 pm to 4 am as it actually requires 5 hours to clean the steam room. It doesn't. This is clearly a ploy for them to conserve energy and save money during the least utilized time of the gym. If you ask the employees at the front counter, they will tell you the steam room and sauna is 24 hours. It's not. Fortunately, the sauna will stay warm until 3 am even despite being turned off because heat can be sustained longer than steam. The purpose of the steam room is for therapeutic muscle recovery and it works far more effectively than a sauna. So, last Friday, I was bummed out because I was told by the front counter that it stop operating at midnight. I got in at 11:40 pm after rushing my workout to beat the midnight time, but it was already too late. 11:30 pm is the correct time. Never did I think I would have to rush my workout at a 24-HOUR gym. The steam room use to turn off around 2-3 am circa 2016 but they have cut it down by a few hours (anyway they can cut costs). If enough people complain, of course the corporate office would reinstate that 2-3 am turnoff time. This is becoming the norm for many 24hr gyms in San Diego, not discrimative to College Grove. So, it's very frustrating for members like me who value the steam rooms for greater recovery. Other than that, this gym is great.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
The location is convenient because it's close to my house.  But the housekeeping and cleanliness is atrocious.  Especially in the Men's Locker Room.  It doesn't matter whether I come in the morning or evening, it's always a mess.  It looks like the ghetto in there.  I've brought it up to the supervisors a few times.  They always find an excuse why it's in poor housekeeping condition (very busy, staff meeting, not enough male staff, etc).  They should just find an way to GET IT DONE instead of finding excuses.  The jacuzzi is equally disgusting.  The toilets are always littered with paper and smells like the SEWAGE.  They need to CLEAN this facility.<//Review>

I'm a very active person, love to work out and get in my daily sesh's 5-10 times a week. The worst gym I've been to. A day pass is $20. I signed up for their FREE 7 DAY PASS which I've never been to a 24hr fitness. Couldn't let me in because I didnt have a local drivers liscense even though I have made an address change to the local area. Straight waste of time driving down their to turn all the way back home with no work out, because who is going to pay $20 to work out when you can work out for free, or even sign up for a planet fitness free day pass. IF YOU ENJOY SEE SAGGY BALLS IN THE MENS LOCKER YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR GYM. EQUIPMENT IS OUTDATED AND MEDIOCRE. THANK YOOOOUUUU 24HR FITNESS FOR A HELL OF AN EXPERIENCE!< /Text>

<Text>It's way too crowded. It smells bad, it's very hot, it's very dirty. I got a ringworm from the mats so I have to be careful now and bring my own sanitizing wipes. No one cleans the machines. It's the only 24 hr fitness near me so I have to put up with it. The staff is rude and the people working out can't never share. I do like that they have many weights and workout equipment.</Text><response>None< /response>< rate>

<review>This is a convenient location for me but this club is older than other ones and it seems like it is always dirty. So much hair on the floor in the womens showers, its disgusting. Really not worth paying a fitness club where you dont want to touch anything or cant take a shower after a workout.</review>< user>

During peak hours it's almost impossible to do anything other than walk around. You have to go at late odd hours to get a good workout in. Good luck finding the dumbbells or plates you need, everything is scattered and the staff cleans up absolutely nothing.< /Text>

This location is a DISASTER. Toilet paper all over the bathroom floor and awful smell in locker room. Gum on floor in shower. This location is one of the few that actually TURNS OFF the steam room and sauna at night (most clubs have the sign but everything still works). Closing this amenity from 11pm to 4am (most clubs close it from 1am-4am) is just cheap and a slap in the face to members who joined a so called 24 hour gym.</Review>

$5 for a towel and they hire a company to clean. Company equals one person per shift and they dont do a good job. It's nasty! Sweat on the equipment and floor. Machines are outdated. 10 digit code and fingerprint required.<//review>

Generally clean these days. Maintenance on the equipment should be better. Of the dozen or so new elliptical machines they got in last month, five are malfunctioning.</review>

<Text>I prefer this location over many, staff is great. Friendly and inviting, idk what people are expecting when its a gym, not a whitehouse visit. Relax people. Gym equipment is just fine, if you think about how many people go and use it, youd expect it to be more worn down but everything works just fine. Location is very good as well. Subway, Sushi and Jamba Juice are next door. This location is my favorite because of the high ceilings.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Worst experience ever I signed up 24 hours fitness in imperial then their jacuzzi was out of service so me and my friend came I checked in as usually people do dial your phone number then scan your index finger , the system accepted me , when I went inside the sales associate manager his name is max told me to get out then I told him why would I get out when I have a membership . I ignored him then while I was enjoying g at the jacuzzi with my friends he called me a police they hand cuffed me and took me outside . What a horrible person he was mad because I didn’t sign up through him !!! I called a lot of time to talk to the general manager and they said he is not available . The guy doesn’t deserve to be in that position . 24 hour fitness they have to take action against this guy ! I have being kicked out got arrested unnecessary force .  And police told me if I go back I will get arrested .i need quick action against Max !!</Review>

<text>I took my daughter for a haircut with Catalina and let me say that it was an amazing experience! I’m VERY picky when it comes to getting my daughters hair cut by anyone, she has very thick and long hair. Without me having to say anything Catalina already knew what to do with my daughters hair! She took her time and made sure it was perfect. I am very happy with the service and will continue to take my daughter for her hair needs. Thanks Catalina!!!<//text>< GmapID>

<Review>Understood, back open Friday, going to be busy that's why they are taking appointments. Made appointment for Sunday at 2:45pm, told to come back in 15 minutes twice because they were really busy -- duh.

Finally told owner I was leaving, he offered no apology and expressed they were just super busy - again duh.

1. Know your business
2. Don't make appointments you can't meet
3. Value the customer time just like they value your time
4. Use common sense when speaking to the customer instead of expressing surprise that your busy.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>After 6 years of living in the Bay Area, I finally found a salon and stylist who can make my very fine hair look good. Jeff is a wonderful, easy going stylist. He knows exactly how to cut hair that doesn't need a lot of product and fussing, especially since I prefer a no fuss, wash and wear haircut.<//Review></record>

I'm happy to recommend UK Hair Salon to anyone seeking a professional, yet friendly, salon with dedicated hairstylists who have many years of experience with cut and color. I've been going to UK Hair for more than 10 years and get compliments from people ~ even 6 weeks after my cut!
UK Hair is not only a full service salon, but it also gets involved in community outreach. Great place, wonderful people, conveniently located, plenty of parking in lots around town. What's more, there are plenty of places to shop and eat in town after your cut.</Text>

UK Hair is a gem! Not only is the staff very friendly and well-organized, but it is a well-kept establishment. Peter, my stylist, has been my hair savior. He is very friendly and funny, never a dull moment. I always leave it up to him with my hair and I have never been let down. I highly recommend UK Hair :)< /Review>

This place is great! I would recommend Susan for haircuts and color. She has her own room in the salon. She's amazing.

I can't recommend Susan enough!
I decided to cut my hair short over a year ago. I would wait to go back to my hometown to get it cut again, because places around here never got it right. Susan, however, knew what I wanted better than I did. She's very good, fast, and professional. I've found my new hairstylist.

Thank you Susan!< /Review>

<text>Since I've been seeing Jeff I've never had a bad hair day. This salon is terrific. The entire staff is friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is equal parts professional, laid back and hip. From the moment I walk in I feel pampered and I always leave with a smile on my face.<//text>< date>

UK Hair is THE best hair salon anywhere!  I've been going for years for hair cuts and hair colors and couldn't be more pleased.  The shop is always clean, the stylists are friendly and up-to-date - and they respect each other.  My hair stylist is Jeff Silverman, who is also the owner, and it's obvious that he runs a top-notch shop.  The receptionists on duty at the desk are exceptional under his training.  I am very happy and satisfied!</text>

Susan Lee is a fabulous and talented hairstylist!!!  I have very curly, thick, unruly hair which is hard to manage and style, but Susan made me look and feel like a celebrity after she cut and styled my hair.  It's very hard to find people who are knowledgeable on how to treat curly hair, but Susan was amazing.  I highly recommend Susan at UK Hair, I have never looked so-o-o good.  Thank you!!!< /Review>

<Review>My experience at UK hair is amazing!!! This was my third visit and I must say I am very satisfied with the service they provide. I would recommend stylist Larry as has a great hand in cutting and styling hair. I had a pretty long hair and I wanted to go back to a short hair style, I did my home work as to what hair style I want and showed him the pic and I must say Larry did a great job in transforming my look I must say each time I walk out of the salon after getting my hair cut I am a 100% satisfied.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>I've been coming to UK Hair for over 7 years now.
They do a terrific job cutting my hair.
They are super pleasant, courteous, and make it easy to schedule appointments - even on short notice at times.
The Salon's atmosphere is very relaxing, even though they are usually pretty busy, and it is in a very nice part of downtown Burlingame.</review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I've been a loyal customer for the past 3 years. Since I've moved to Vallejo, I still come in for my terrific hair cut and color. I do recommend Jeff the owner for a hair cut and Rochelle for color.<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>I have been going to UK Hair for about two years and have been so happy with the hair cuts and dyes I've received from Jeff, the owner. He's extremely professional and REALLY knows hair. The first thing he did was change the type of dye used on my hair to a peroxide base. It lasts longer and doesn't damage my hair as much. He also understands and is proficient in curly hair, which isn't true of many hairdressers. I'd certainly recommend him. I'm giving the salon four stars overall rather than five because it can be loud, and I have sensitivity to loud noises, but Jeff definitely gets five stars.< /Text><GmapID>0x808f9df114a0c56f:0x35e3222efbb8909e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been getting my hair cuts at UK Hair with Larry for the past few years. The staff are always friendly and it is easy to get an appointment. Great location in downtown Burlingame. Larry is an artist - you shoudl talk to him about his paintings - and he takes great pride in giving you a good hair cut. Highly recommend him and UK Hair in general.<//Review>

UK Hair is the essence of a contemporary salon with great congeniality. The client is the focus. The staff interact amazingly well with each other and with the customer. Talent in cutting,styling and coloring of hair is evident,as the clientele are a mix of young and older regulars. Just the longevity of the salon speaks volumes for its' service.  Thank you---Bob & MaryAnne Burlinson< /text>

A lot went wrong during my visit with this hairsalon but I was actually going to give it 4 stars because I am quite happy with the result. But Irena put a $35 (!) gratitude on my check without asking me! Since I had spent 2.5 hours to get a haircut and color I just wanted to get out. But of course, it is actually unacceptable to put your own tip of $35 (!) without even asking.< /Text>

<review>Lisa does my highlights and always does an amazing job! She's nailed anything I've ever wanted to try out (hombre, a hint of red, all over blonde) and is a a blast to talk to so the time flies by. Jeff is a close family friend and has cut all of my husband's relatives for years.  He always gives me just the right cut, whether I want to stick with my look or try something new. It's always easy to get an appointment and even setup my time with Lisa and Jeff back to back so I don't have to go in twice.  We are lifelong UK Hair customers!< /review></record>

My husband and I checked out UK hair on line. We were visiting our son who lives in San Carlos, and had been away from home 6 weeks. We had spent some time in  Miami and Las Vegas and both really needed hair cuts .Both seniors, our hair is a challenge, but we were delighted with the results, all the reveiws are spot on and we had a great experience. The salon and its staff are delightful and made us both very welcome and at ease. We are now in San Francisco and our hair still looks great. Highly recommend a vist to all ages.</Review>

I have a special SUV. It’s 19 years old and mostly original. It’s in nice condition and just needs the major things done.

I came here off a Groupon and learned that they do excellent work. I had my steering and part of my suspension replaced and it was nicely done.

It’s amazing what a difference it made.</text>

<Review>They were great from beginning to end! I called and they scheduled me for later that day. Upon arrival, I didn't have to wait for them to start the alignment, and the service was done in just under 45 minutes as they had said. They did not upsell, and only gave me a card on my way out since I inquired about other services. They also included a print-out of my alignment details (and also they did all 3 types of alignment...I noticed some places say they only do a "toe" alignment).</Review>< Time>

Larry, the owner, was so friendly and I really appreciate the service that was done. I got a tire alignment and I highly recommend to anyone that needs service done on their car. There is also a lounge you can sit in with wifi while your car is being serviced. Overall great experience!<//review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>Where to begin..? Brought in my car for a 4 wheel alignment.. they did great with the alignment but they kept my wheel lock keys. I drove to Vegas not knowing that I'd be stranded if I got a flat tire. Found out that my wheel lock key was missing when I was getting my brakes done elsewhere. Called them and they said its unlikely they had them. Got there and guess what? They had my wheel lock keys after all. People make mistakes, that's fine but the heavier set guy said it wasn't his fault because the keys were found in his colleague's toolbox. I mean.... just an apology and accountability would have been the right way out instead of passing the blame around. Never coming here again considering they made a mistake yet they weren't even accountable. People.... REMEMBER to get your wheel locks from these guys if you do decide to come here! I know I won't!</Review>< pics>

Used a Groupon for an alignment after I had just put a lift on my 4runner. They were able to get everything back into spec and they even double checked some of the work I did on the suspension to make sure she was safe to drive. Good guys, super down to earth. I highly recommend.< /review>

<Text>Friendly service. Came in for wheel alignment. Service was delayed even though I left my car there over the weekend. I didn't make an appointment, so be sure to do so. Service looks to be good so far. Will return for other repairs.<//Text>< Name>

A good shop to take one's car for Alignment ,tires or a repair job. The owner and staff are very forthcoming about what the repairs will entail and the cost. Definitely a place I would go back again.</review>

<Text>These guys are the best! It's not always easy to find a trustworthy mechanic, but your search will end here. Larry and his team are honest, quick and efficient. Helped out with both mine and my sister's car at a very reasonable cost. Strongly recommend for auto repair services in Costa Mesa.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Awesome service. I found a bubble in my tire sidewall (after it unexpectedly kissed the curb) on a Thursday late afternoon (4-5ish) and called the shops around my area. America's Tire was busy (took a total of three call and ~15 minute wait to speak with someone), and similarly no one picked up at the nearby Pep Boys. Both suggested I come in early Friday as a walk-in.

I called Mac's auto and was given a price estimate immediately, and they were willing to see me ASAP. I dropped my car off in the evening (per my request) and received a call from them first thing in the morning to give me an update.

The general rule of thumb is to change tires in pairs due to uneven wear, and most shops I've been to really push me to change the pair. However, Mac's let me know just for my knowledge, but presented my options - swap only one tire now, or swap both and keep the used tire as a spare. I asked some questions about wear and decided to swap just the one, which they accepted without hassle.

The repair took less than a day (without reservation) and the total including alignment, was very reasonable - definitely cheaper than what America's Tire in Culver had charged me earlier this year, comparatively.

The people were all super friendly and I was in the shop for less than 15 minutes total from start to finish.

I definitely plan on taking my car back in as long as I'm in the OC area!<//Review>

Thank you Mac's auto repair and Thank you Larry!  You guys are awesome and have proven you can take care of your customers.  After moving into the area and not finding a good shop, I came across Mac's Auto Repair....  The work has been great and Larry has been awesome at taking care of any lose ends.  All in all very satisfied and recommend all of you to stop here and give them a try.  You will not be disappointed.  I will be coming back here anytime I need any service on my car.  You have won a customer for life.

Thank you again for all your hard work!<//review>

Had my Audi serviced there for Tierods and an alignment, they had it done quick and easy the same day I brought it in. No hassle like other places I've had to bring it. Pricing was really reasonable and I will continue to bring my car there and recommend it to anyone! It's a little hard to find and it's a smaller shop but they do amazing work.

This shop is one of the BEST!!!  Started taking my company vehicles to Larry and now he services everything I own but my motorcycle!  Larry is HONEST, which you do not find in most repair shops, and is all around a good individual.  If something does not need fixing, he will NOT try and get you to fix it!!!  Larry will provide you a "real" timeline of when it is absolutely necessary to get something done and will not just try and reach into your wallet!

I can't say enough about Mac's Auto!

I started using this place for minor things and then I had a motor go out on my car and I called several places and Larry was the best to work with. Not only did he provide such an fair quote but the actual bill was so close to the quote. They are not pushy about fixing things and I have found them to be ethical and very straight forward.< /Text>

I purchased a $53.00 groupon for alignment. When I made the appointment I also requested to have my wheels balanced. The charge is $10.00 a wheel for the balance service. After the work was finished and it was time to pay the gentleman who was helping me said that I did not need my wheels balanced. He said that I needed new tires in about three thousand miles, he told me if I came back to their auto shop they would give me a good deal, and he gave me a discount coupon for my next visit. I was really impressed with the great service and their honesty. I trust this auto shop and will most likely go to them when I need tires.<//review>

Great service, low price.   That's what I got last week when I went in to get my wheels aligned. I knew my tires were shot, too, but didn't intend to replace them just yet -- until I was given a fantastic price I couldn't turn down. Add in-and-out in about two hours -- what more could I ask for?    Like Arnold says, "I'll be back."<//Text>

<text>I was about to go to another place to have my aircon fixed. I googled and found Mac's Automotive repair at the last minute. I called and Larry said bring it in and we will check it out for you. When I got there it started working again. Instead of trying to get me to keep the car there Larry said just bring it back if it stops again. Well it Stopped and I brought it right in. Larry got it in the guys did the diagnostic and had it fixed in a couple of hours. OH the price was AWESOME. I also had him replace the spark plugs and the car runs great now. If you are looking for an honest guy who will give you a great price, Give Larry a call. They have earned all my business. I cant say thank you enough.  They even fixed my alignment which has been out since ATD did an alignment. I highly recommend MAC's Automotive.< /text><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

This place is closed every other Saturday... pretty upset since I just wasted a trip from Irvine. I tried calling ahead of time but no one picks up the phone. Yelp said that the business is open today. There's people working there but they aren't open for service. Not sure if I want to give this place a shot given the Groupon deal.

Edit: I came back and did the groupon deal- it works!</text>

The only thing I don't like about this place is not all the washers and dryers have the availability to use your debit/credit cards.  The staff are usually very friendly and willing to help.< /Review>

It serves its purpose. Good business.
Lots of machines of various load sizes. They keep the place clean!!
Can get busy on weekends..
Coin operated with a change machine onsite.

This is not your typical laundromat, Wash and fold (per pound 24hr turn-around) clean floors, attentive staff. Store with reasonably priced soap, softener etc. if you forgot something. There are multiple locations in San Jose, Campbell.  All stores have an employee during business hours. I have noticed the employees that have been replaced speak little English than the previous employees.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

This place is a great place with professional and friendly staff. I love them all ,but my favorite employee that works there  I learned to know her name by Angel and is fairly new and every time I'm there and when I see her she works very hard and offers a helping hand, very sweet and professional, very good person. Good job launderlux with your selection of staff.</Text>

<Review>This washhouse is my new place to do my laundry.  It is really clean and has staff there at all times to help. The washing machines are a good price and dryers work well. They have a TV area and snack machines. The bathrooms are nice and clean you have to ask one of the staff for the key. The only downfall is the parking lot is small and I have seen people run into the dumpsters trying to get in or out of the parking space and since they're on the corner of A street  and near BART there's limited street parking.<//Review>< Response>

Wow! I wish there was a Launderlux in San Leandro. But hey, if I'm willing to bring my laundry here all the way to Hayward then it says something. This place is very clean. The bathroom is immaculate. The workers here are approachable, nice and helpful.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>This is the cleanest laundry mat i have found in the bay area EVER and clean machines are a plus when you have to do your laundry in a public place... This place is different.  Seriously, we gotta wash our clothes!  They're all germy and yucky-stinky, spilled on- stained fabrics and yes its a terrible thing  but its inevitable! and at OTHER PLACES we sometimes pick things up and take them home with us BUT NOT FROM HERE!  They sanitize and sanitize and sanitize. They keep a keen eye out and approach these potential bandits promptly inside and outside of each machine. And the dryers dry like theyre supposed to so your clothes last longer, smell better, etc etc.  In the big dryers i use 6 quarter's for 3 loads of towels.  Cant beat that!!! 👏👏👏👏  2 thumbs up! 👍👍You're THE best!  You set the standard!  Thank you!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Very friendly staff. My husband and I were looking for a wash and fold place and we found launderlux online with great reviews. We came in on a Wednesday and they told us about a special they run on Wednesdays which is a $1.10 a pound as opposed to the $1.35(I think this was the regular cost but don't quote me) they regularly have. We dropped it off and they said it would be ready the next day. We came in on Thursday and everything was washed and folded perfectly and we received great friendly service again with a different team there. Great place for wash and fold! It was also very clean. Just remember they don't take card so bring cash.< /Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Excellent place but with limited parking.

Apart from that the girl keeps the place very neat and has toilets for the users.

They have several seats for customers, it avoids the fatigue of standing.

Excelente lugar pero con la limitación de estacionamiento.

Aparte de eso la muchacha mantiene muy aseado elmlugar y cuenta con sanitarios para los usuarios.

(Translated by Google) I would not give them a star they are very expensive when you arrive you see that it is cheap when you are throwing the coins you charge more for another thing 1 dollar more for heavy according to 25 seats for low is a loss of coming to whom it is very small and the washing machines do not lose your time here I recommend you read laundry is the Megor that there is mega large and very nice people who work there take care of their customers.

(Original)
no les daria ni una estrella son carisimos al llegar ves que es barato cuando estas echando las coras te cobra mas por otra cosa 1 dolar mas por heavy segun 25 sentavos por low es una perdida de venir a qui es carisimo y pequeñas las lavadoras no pierdan su tiempo aqui les recomiendo lee laundry es La Megor que hay es mega grande y muy lindas las personas que trabajan ahi cuidan de sus clientes .< /Review>

Great store. Restrooms are clean. Service is prompt. Seating inside is adequate. There is seating outside, but it will be 65°, breezy, with a hint of rain. What do you expect it's the gold coast 😂<//Review>

<review>I had never done a food tour before, so I wasn’t sure what to expect or how much we would be able to taste, but I’m so glad I decided to take this tour! I did the Chinatown and North Beach Tour and it was great! The guide met us (me, a few other couples, and another solo traveler) in front of the Dragons Gate and over the course of a few hours, we transversed Chinatown and Little Italian, eating our way up and down streets and listening to the knowledgeable guide! There were two times that we all sat down together to enjoy a meal, as well as the numerous « snacks » along the way. I absolutely recommend for anyone looking to tour the city in a unique way (especially for foodies or people who just like to eat in general), meet new people, and explore places that you may not have explored on your own!<//review><username>Gina Wirfel<//username>< rating>

I've been to San Francisco many times but Isabella showed me new places and taught me new things about a city I've always loved visiting. All the food stops were tasty and small hole in the wall type places that I really enjoy visiting.  I'd recommend the tour to friends and will be back another time for the North Beach tour.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>We had an excellent experience in late June on the Chinatown tour. Outstanding guide. Really enjoyed visiting not only restaurants and getting to taste great ethnic food, but also getting to the local Buddhist temple. We also had a stop at a local tea shop which was very educational and fun!

Brian was very informative and knowledgeable about the history of Chinatown and gave us lots of information about the food that we tasted as well.  We made several stops throughout our afternoon together, and each was tasty and informative.  We ended with a very interesting tea tasting.  We re-visited some of the restaurants/shops throughout our weekend visit and felt so much more aware of what to order by having this foundation. Thanks Brian!< /Text>< date>

In town as a tourist, or a longtime resident who never ventured outside your own neighborhood?  Don’t miss these tours!  I recently took a tour of Chinatown and it was chockful of hidden sites, heretofore unknown factoids and authentic Chinese cuisine. And I’m a SF native!!!  Tour guide ISABELLA is not only incredibly knowledgeable about this little gem of an enclave, she is warm, friendly and funny. I highly recommend this company — you’ll end of knowing more than the native San Franciscans!</text>

We enjoyed great June weather and some wonderful tastes in San Francisco. Getting a culinary tour of North Beach is like a local experts guides to the flavors of San Francisco. Every food sampling today was delicious. Some of the restaurants were beautiful and I would definitely return to.

Cynthia was a very kind hostess and served everyone with a smile. I appreciated the spots where she added history to the tour. She was very polite and considerate to all of the guests.

It felt a bit long, though enjoyable, and it would be good to carry a bottle of water for in between stops.

I think just about everyone, local or visiting San Francisco, woukd enjoy this tour.</Review>

<review>We really enjoyed this tour.  Cynthia did a great job of presenting the culture and history of the San Francisco north beach area while escorting us to several shops in addition to the restaurants.   Our tour group was fairly small, just six people with Cynthia.  I thought this was perfect since it gave us a chance to interact with the other tour members and still be able to hear Cynthia. This was quite a good experience.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

We took the Chinatown and North Beach Night Walking Tour with Brian as our guide and it was amazing! We got to eat so much delicious food (including the world's best moon cakes and authentic Italian cannoli). Brian's knowledge of the city and its history really made the experience come to life. This tour is a great way to explore Chinatown and North Beach.<//text>

<Review>We did the Chinatown tour a few years back to celebrate my wife's birthday. We had a large party which got split into 3 tour groups, but all met back at the restaurant for the birthday luncheon.  The company did a great job planning the entire event.  We came up with unique touches that made the birthday celebration truly special.  The guides were knowledgeable and friendly.  All our guests enjoyed the tour.  I would like to try other tours are offered Local Tastes of the City since it's a great way to explore this beautiful and historic city.<//Review><UserId.>107327111629479594858</UserId.>< Resp>

My daughter and I loved the North Beach/Little Italy food tour today with Blandina. She is an absolute repository of knowledge, anecdotes and side stories as well as little visits that transform the tour from a foodie walk to a cultural stroll through art, history and love of life. Thank you!!!!<//Review>

I love these tours!  I've done Chinatown and North Beach with my family and it's something everyone enjoyed.  Loved the french bakery and the fresh ground coffee beans, and love the tour of the church.  In Chinatown the fortune cookie factory was a favorite as well.  The tour guides have a great sense of humor and I would recommend these tours to all.<//text>

My husband, daughter (12), son (15) and I took the North Beach tour. We had a great time walking around and tasting the different foods. Tom was entertaining and very knowledgeable. I have to eat a gluten free diet and there were even items for me. We went in July so it was beautiful weather as well. Would definitely recommend!<//review>

This was a fun tour I went on with girlfriends.  The tour guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  We went to a bakery and other places in North Beach.  It was very scenic and informative.  The only downside is that the food didn't blow me away until we stopped at the last pizza place we went to.  Would have been nice to have a variety of pastas.  Perhaps integrating Chinatown and Northbeach together into a tour would be nice, since they're in the same neighborhood anyway.  I would recommend the tour to visitors of SF, and tourists, but not SF natives or foodies.<//review>

<review>The walking tours were some of the best experiences my wife and I had on our trips to SF.  A friend had recommended the Walking Chinese Food Tour, which is the first one we took.  It was fantastic visiting the shops and seeing how fortune cookies were made.  Please keep in mind this is a walking tour and the China Town area has lots of hills.  Although the group doesn't move along at a sprint, it does need to keep moving in order to see everything within the time window.  Wear comfortable clothes and walking/jogging shoes.  As my wife put it, don't worry about looking cute on this tour.

The following year, we took the tour of Little Italy.  It was a lot of fun!  We enjoyed the bakeries, the culture and the fresh roasted coffee, which is the best cup I've ever had!  This tour didn't have as many hills as the China Town tour and it moved at a bit slower pace.  Be prepared to eat A LOT!!  We had made reservations to eat at an Italian restaurant at the end of the tour and had to cancel because we weren't hungry at all.

The City offers a ton of different sights to be seen, but the best ones that we've experienced were these walking tours.  We always recommend these to anyone visiting SF who haven't already done them.  Enjoy!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We have now taken 2 tours with Tom.  The first time, we took the North Beach tour.  We found Tom to be both personable and a fountain of local knowledge.  Moreover, he more than filled our bellies with incredible food. Stop after stop we were offered delicious options.  We had such a good time that on our next visit to San Francisco, we signed up for the Chinatown tour.  Again, we were treated to a wonderful time.  If you want to learn about the city (not just food related, but a good general history) and eat really well I encourage you to try one of these tours.  Tom is a local gem.</review>

We went on the Chinatown/North Beach night tour with Cynthia, I believe.  It was a great tour overall.  We walked through some of Chinatown, saw fortune cookies being manufactured, checked out a few stores in Chinatown, and then headed to North Beach.  It was a nice evening and Cynthia was very knowledgeable on the area. Would highly recommend.</Review>

We thoroughly enjoyed our North Beach Tour with Blondina.  She had interesting stories about everything we saw as well as about herself.  She paid strict attention to our dietary needs and provided excellent tastes of the local cuisine.  I would recommend this tour for visitors to SF, as well as natives.  We saw the North Beach area in ways we had not viewed it before.  It is a great group activity.< /Text>

This tour is fantastic!  This is the second time I have taken house guests....and everyone is delighted with the food, and the history of the City and especially North Beach.  Our guide, Blandina is wonderful!  She knows so much about the area. She is fun, and truly cares about all of her guests. I plan on taking this again soon with local friends.  I recommend this event completely!< /text>

When I visited San Francisco, I asked the concierge about Food Tours and she recommended this tour.  I absolutely loved The Tour of Italy.  It was so much fun.  I enjoyed the food tastings but the tour guide added so much trivia due to his extreme knowledge about the area it added so much to the overall experience!  The tour made my visit to San Francisco so much more memorable.  I can't tell you how many people I have shared those same tidbits of information I learned from that tour.  I can't wait to visit the city and attend more tours!!!< /Text>

We had some amazing food along the way and incredible conversation that included history of the city.  I felt like I had a behind-the-scenes foodie tour of San Francisco.  Definitely recommend for visitors who want to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time while visiting the area and sample some great food.</Review>< pics>

We have gone twice on the North Beach walking tour.  We highly recommend it!  It is a casual walk in the neighborhood.  You will hear a lot of anecdotes about the neighborhood from someone who truly loves it.  Be prepare to sample delicious goodies at numerous stops.</text>

<Review>My sisters and I did the Chinatown/North Beach night walking tour and LOVED it.  We had a great time exploring parts of Chinatown that we never would have visited, particularly the tea house.  This is a great activity for groups or families.

<review>Our family took the North Beach/Little Italy tour with Tom.  A fantastic experience. both food/drink wise as well as a terrific history lesson.  We liked that Tom was organized and prepared and took special care to coordinate with the local businesses to ensure our experience was perfect.  We have toured with other groups in SF and found that experience to be sub-standard compared to this North beach tour.  We will definitely take another tour with this company.< /review></record></dataset><record>

He even stayed on the phone with me to make sure we met up with the group. On top of everything else, excellent customer service! We are looking forward to taking another tour!

My daughter and I did a Mission tour with Chris. We loved the pace and the food was great. My daughter is a vegetarian and they accommodated her beautifully and she had more than I did to eat! There was so much great food, but what made the tour really great was Chris and his knowledge of the area and his relationships with the owners of the stores and restaurants. I will definitely take another tour with Chris the next time I am in San Francisco.<//text>

My fiance and I definitely enjoyed our Chinatown tour with our guide, Tom. We took the Sunday morning tour with one other couple. We talked at length afterward that it was better than we expected it to be, even after reading positive reviews about it. We liked that we got a nice overview of the history and perspective of Chinatown from a San Fran native and learned a lot of interesting facts. The food was delicious and was totally different from any other "Chinese" food we've had before. In fact, we are still salivating when thinking of those steamed pork buns and the bean-filled sesame balls! The tea tasting room was also nice and a great way to end the tour. Thanks again for the entertaining and informative time in Chinatown. Don't change a thing, it was all perfect!

<username>Esther Alpert</username><Review>My teenage daughters and I did the tour of the Little Italy area.  The guide was friendly and very knowledgeable.  The tour was well planned and hit lots of fun places.  We learned about roasting small batch coffee and sampled excellent coffee drinks, toured the back of a bakery where we were offered delicious breads and cookies, saw fudge being made in a candy store and more, ultimately finishing with a sit-down meal of gourmet pizza.  It was lots of fun.< /Review>< user>

<Text>We toured China Town with Tom and saw lots of unusual places we would not have seen otherwise.
Loved the fortune cookie factory, love the "market" and the "ceremonial" store with the paper items used for burials, explanation of the instruments interesting.
But didn't like the dim sum served in the back of a bakery, wasn't very good.
Tom is a lovely man just wish he would explain more about what we were experiencing as we walked through the area. We happened on a public park and would have loved to know what the history was and what people were doing now?
History of the Buddhist temple (before we entered) we visited would have been interesting. Sort of felt rushed in order to see it all.
Might want to slow down and watch this world go by! All in all, I would recommend a tour  Chinatown.</Text><user>100185383246854069446< /user>< Rating>

This was a good tour and well worth the cost.  We did the North Beach tour, and I really enjoyed the behind the scenes looks as well as trying some restaurants that seemed more for the locals than the tourist.  The guide was very knowledgeable.  Pace was good.  I took my tweenage son, who is something of a foodie, and he had a good time as well.</review>

We had a wonderful time! The guide was very knowledgeable and was able to add a lot of color to the tour. The food was amazing! So many stop and savor moments, from foccacia to chocolate to olive oils, it was a wonderful and filling afternoon. A bonus, we got the opportunity to see some of the hidden gems of Little Italy, and go off the beaten path and find local treats.

It's totally worth it!< /Text>

It was a glorious day in SF (not always a given, especially weather-wise) when several of us took our walking/foodie tour of North Beach (Little Italy).  Not only did we visit a coffee roasting venue, we had pizza, cannoli, and other delights.  Our tour guide, Blondie, was a delight (she even wrote a lovely children's book).  We also visited a beautiful church.< /review>

<review>It's been a while since we took this tour, but it has stayed with us for years.  Every single time we return to San Francisco we revisit the places we were shown.  Every single time we revisit the places we are so glad we took the first tour!  These guides are terrific, great sense of humor, taking care if someone can't walk quite as fast, might need to rest for a moment, but most of all, know exactly what they are doing!  In fact, writing this review makes me realize that we should take the tour again and find out everything else we have been missing!  Thank you, LTCT!!< /review>< username>

What a fabulous tour.  Been to San Francisco many times and was looking for something different.  The tour was informative as well as delicious.  All our stops involved some type of refreshment or food and it was delicious.  Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and very engaging.  Couldn't recommend this more!< /review>

<Review>Unfortunately, I would not recommend the North Beach food tour. For Valentine's Day last year, my husband and I took the tour with some friends. It was fun spending time in North Beach but I was disappointed with the quality of the tour. The tour guide was friendly but the overall presentation/information was light weight. When I take a tour I really want to learn about the area, the culture, and the history. The tour was at a elementary level when I had expected at least high school level experience.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>The Local Tastes tour was a delightful way to learn about San Francisco's Chinatown and experience it first-hand!  From the time our guide met us at the entrance gate and began explaining the symbolism of our surroundings, we felt transported back to an earlier time.  We walked at a leisurely pace and listened to a fascinating historical narrative between tastings, which included multiple restaurants, a tea room, open-air market and a fortune cookie factory.  The quantity of food was generous and in fact more than we could eat - so we took the leftovers with us for an afternoon snack!  The entire experience was a very good value for the cost and left us completely satisfied and wanting to find similar tours in other cities.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I know first hand its tough to find a quality experience through yelp and places like that, so please take my word for it--this is awesome.  very much worth it.  we still talk about it.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>We were contacted two hours before the tour was supposed to start and told that there were low numbers for our scheduled tour and could we cancel or move to a different time! And this is for a company that has a 48 hour, rain or shine cancellation policy! We said we could not cancel, we were only in the city for one day, so the tour company agreed to meet us as promised. The guide was 15 minutes late, and while he was an amiable fellow he seemed to be more interested in spending time on his tablet/laptop than guiding the tour. Food tastings were average, nothing you couldn't buy or find yourself in Chinatown of most major cities in the US. The tea sampling was very good, but overall a disappointing experience. Wouldn't recommend this outfit.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808580f1a4dafb23:0x6c4117b63104c46f<//gmap_id></record>

Went on a tour in the North Beach area and I would say it was mediocre. The food was good and we tasted at a good variety of places, but our tour guide was a bit long-winded and there were long stretched (up to an hour) where we didn't eat any food. But it was a fun way to see the area and learn the history. I loved going in to the old Catholic church and loved the bread stop the most.<//Review>

Blondina was a fountain of knowledge about the history and culture of the neighborhood. She not only knows it but lives it everyday. It was absolutely fantastic and would do it again 100% at the drop of a hat. Very much worth every penny.</Text>

He was friendly, but had an awkward style that was difficult to be around for us.  We saw some interesting things and places, he was knowledgable, and in that regard we enjoyed it.  The food we ate was odd and fine for tasting, but wishing we were able to eat something we were comfortable eating.  Our expectations were for it to be a food tour, but we didn't eat any food for at least one hour, and then it was only the one stop for food, which was just appetizers. (dim sum)  We expected to be fed a little more.  He did know a lot about the city, which was cool, and we enjoyed making the fortune cookies and I loved the music shop.  I just remember feeling so much relief when it was over.</review><Gmap_id>0x808580f1a4dafb23:0x6c4117b63104c46f< /Gmap_id>< response>

We enjoyed this tour.  I got to discover a lot of unknown places that I wouldn't have found by myself.  So much fun to get samples of all the different treats in SF!< /Review>

My husband and I went on the tour for my birthday, we got lucky that no one else had booked the early tour that day and ended up getting a private tour. Our tour guide Blandina was amazing! she knew so much about the neighborhood and we had a really great time.< /review>

It was an awesome little tour. They take you locally owned shops that i would have never found on my own. Only thing its more of a walking tour than a food tour, i was still pretty hungry when the tour was complete</Review>

My husband, two daughters and I took the San Francisco Food Tour through Little Italy.  Our guide was knowledgeable and funny.  He made the experience a positive and educational one.  The Food Tour was a highlight of our San Francisco trip!</review>

<text>Had a great SF China Town tour on September 8, 2016.  Our guide, Lois, was a font of knowledge on the history and culture of the area.  We had some great food at several places including a fortune cookie bakery, delicious BEGONI Bistro, another bakery where we enjoyed a "moon" cake and some dim sum samples, and last was a wonderful tea tasting at Vital Tealeaf.  Everything was delicious, and we saw quite a bit in our 3 hours.  I would highly recommend this tour and our guide, Lois.<//text>< rate>

I attended this tour twice, once two years ago and the last time was about a year ago. I would have to say I really enjoyed the first tour better, we had the same tour guide Tom, I think his name was? However, we stopped at more places on the first tour, maybe it was the time of the year, I'm not sure, but it was just so much better the first time. We were able to eat fish tacos, taste authentic coffee, go to a bakery and taste fresh bread, we even went to an Italian joint where we sampled fresh dishes, it was delish! And the walk wasn't hard, it was all relatively close proximity to everything. It was very easy meeting up for the tour and we ended at the same spot and enjoyed our last dish, pizza. This is where we said our goodbye's and was given an Ipad in case we wanted to leave a tip. On the second tour, I must say it was extremely easy to book as I called the same day an arranged our reservations over the phone with Tom. Anyways, if your passing through or have sometime I would recommend this tour, it was fun!</Text>

<Text>My husband and I went on the North Beach/Chinatown tour with Eileen on June 2nd. We were very disappointed. Very little food and not very good. Spent a lot of time in Tea Room and then we were pressured to buy something. Ate mostly sweet things and mediocre pizza and wine at end of tour.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808580f1a4dafb23:0x6c4117b63104c46f<//Gmap_id><Name>Carla McGee< /Name>< Pics>

<review>We went on the North Beach/Little Italy Food Tour.  Ad states we would see Bay Area Olive Oils, a chocolatier and freshly baked bread, but we saw none of that!  We were taken to a candy shop and given a small bag of candy.  Disappointing. Also, went to a sandwich shop where we had a small sandwich.  The coffee shop was good and the pizza at the end of the tour was very good. Ad needs to be rewritten if those places are not included in the tour.

Our tour guide Blondina, was knowledgeable about the  area, but talked way too much about herself, her political views, etc.  At the end of the tour, she read us a children's book (she wrote) that had nothing to do with the food tour.  She continued with how expensive the rent is and how it is going up because of people with money that are, apparently, swaying the mayor.  This is not what we paid to hear.

While the little food we sampled was very good, it was overshadowed by this guide's personal issues.

Upon our return home, I called the management of this company who was very apologetic and said this was out of character for this tour guide.  He offered to return some of our money or give us another tour of San Francisco which was appreciated although I declined both.

For the price paid per person, we felt there should have been more food involved, and certainly more information.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

We took the North Beach Walking Food Tour with Blandina and it was wonderful! Blandina lives in North Beach and knows all the locals personally. Her love of the city and the North Beach neighborhood shines through in the tour. We learned about the history and culture of the area while enjoying tasty snacks and beverages all along the way. Unlike most of San Francisco, North Beach is fairly level, so it's not a difficult walk. I would definitely recommend this tour for a taste of Little Italy in the Bay area.<//text>

<user_name>Jess A</user_name><pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Learned more about the city than actually eating and trying new food. It was more like an insiders look on the history of San Fran rather than a eating tour. We DID try food but it was rather samples than small plates/appetizers and often it seemed like the restaurant was doing the tour a favor rather than the other way around. The tour guide bused the tables herself and even served all the food and water instead of the venues actually serving us. I didnt expect a 4course meal and sit down service but some type of service from the businesses would have been nice and appreciated.

My group ended up going to eat afterwards. We enjoyed all the insider information the tour guide provided but we expected a bit more actual food and tastes rather than free samples from restaurants doing us a favor.

Informative but not filing basically.<//Text>< user_id>

I used to go to empire gardens, but good lyfe is where it's at, the choices are endless, and people that work are legit smokers who always have great choices, look out for my man Curtis he knows his and you won't regret, and one more thing the prices are unbeatable< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Absolutely love it here. Budtenders are knowledgeable and friendly truly lovely people. Super helpful and let’s not forget their wide variety. The options seem endless and their products are always good. Pickup was speedy and efficient. I got lucky to have Curtis as my bud tender. He recommended me better products without pushing my budget or even trying to do so (which is so nice bc everyone tries to sell u more). He genuinely cares about his work and it’s honestly great my nearest dispensary happens to be the best in the city at least. Definitely worth going to regularly if not at least once.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>So I’m not usually the type to write bad reviews but I’m writing this one because I felt a bit uncomfortable. Around closing time, I pulled up and they weren’t able to serve me which was no problem, it was my fault for being late. As I was getting out the car, there was a car (looked light brown?) that drove up to my car, and the dude pulled down his side window, yelled that they were closed and then drove off. Dude then waited for me with his car just facing me until I left. I would have been good with the security guard telling or the dude even staying and communicating properly, but this dude came off like he was trying to intimidate me to leave, which left me uncomfortable. I don’t think I’ll be coming here again, but I can say from personal experience that I’ve experienced better service at other places.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dca78452d534e9:0x8735fa1ff5607ef5<//gmap_id><user_name>Abanoub F.

<text>Moreno Valley is lucky to have this place. First timers get 10% off, and they have a pretty big selection. Anything from flower, to cannabis literature. Ask for Curtis, super helpful, knowledgeable, and all around nice guy. I'll definitely be returning to this place. I fully endorse it!< /text>< Resp>

{'time': 1616507417472, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to let us know how we are doing, your feedback is greatly appreciated! Our buyer is always trying to make sure we have the best products on our shelves and sometimes what we see doesn’t always translates into consistency which is what we are looking for in every product. Every product is prepackaged so it’s hard to really judge the product in that way. We hope to continue getting better and bringing in new product in hopes you find joy in trying it all. We rely on our customers to let us know what is good and not good so we can let the vendors know they have product which isn’t the best representation of themselves, because who really wants to put out a bad product? If you could send me a message about what you’ve bought that wasn’t up to standards I can address with our vendors to be better. We also have a survey in store that says gas or pass so we can get some feedback on all our products. Thank you for your time and we hope your future visits are positive ones. In the chance that it isn’t, please let us know. Thank you for being a valued customer!'}</response>

Well, what can I say about this amazing place? Let's see the staff is amazing and the selection of products with a very upscale layout and not to mention a really good vibe from the budtenders. This is my new go-to place. In case you're wondering they have online ordering and delivery. I haven't tried it yet but I will. Anyways follow my IG @travelingwithbuds for other reviews and weed travels</text>

Called to see if they had an ATM and also to see if they had a military discount.  the person who answered the phone was very short and rude!   this was gonna be my first time but now I refuse to spend my money after his attitude and poor customer service.  I was actually sitting in the parking lot 🤦🏾‍♂️</review>

I went back to Goodlyfe Dispensary today.
I went at 7 a.m., and was in, and out, in 5 minutes.
I always go early in the day, it is not crowded, and the young people are ALWAYS friendly, and Professional. Always great prices, always good selection. Always have a good time at this place!< /text>

They gave me the wrong product. and after I walked out and went right back in to exchange the product they said they couldn’t exchange it even when the person who helped me  told the manager that my order was wrong and it was his fault. They still denied me my exchange for my cartridge. The service here is awful and I’m never shopping here again. U can’t even see what ur getting because they put it in there tablet then you go to someone else to do your transaction not even with the person you started. So how does your order not get lost in the translation. Never going here again< /text>

I have been a resident here for a number of years. I love living at 255 South Grand. The front desk security and the leasing office staff are really friendly and helpful. One of the things I love most about the building is the amenities!< /review>

<review>Great building overall. But the elevators are an issue. On weekends it's common to wait 10+ minutes for one to come. And one has been entirely down for 7+ months as I understand, with no timeline to repair.

Management staff are great and very responsive, common spaces are always well-kept, apartments are spacious and nice, amenities are solid, all of the lobby and maintenance staff are super cool, professional, and go out of their way to be helpful. If you're considering moving here, I just suggest asking when that fourth elevator will be fixed.</review><Date>1620312759673<//Date><Rate>4< /Rate>< gmapID>

Lobby is hot... Need better AC at lobby... First impression count! Comfortable guest and tenants need better AC!

On the good side, despite the hot lobby, the female Asian guest representative at the lobby is super MEGA cheerful and friendly!<//review>

<Text>Let me start off by saying that management is amazing! I love them all.

However, I am going on the third year living here and the elevators have NEVER worked properly. At time, literally ONE elevator for a 27 floor building and over 300 units!

You will be waiting literally 20 mins. Extremely annoying, inconvenient and a disaster waiting to happen.

Given the global pandemic and “social distancing”, it is impossible to get on an elevator without being exposed to 10 other people trying to get to their units.

They have never worked and everyone keeps saying they’re being “worked” on. Terrible.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c64d1f743c41:0xbdc8adfba95971d8<//gmap_id></record>

He made the whole process a breeze and was extremely helpful and available during the move in process. The location is great, and amenities are good as well. Nice place to live.

Shortly after moving in however, I discovered that they have been working on the elevators for months, and continue to do so. You will be waiting anywhere between 5-15min for an elevator during the morning and afternoon times. Sometimes longer. They do not have a timeline for when they will be fixed. I would look at other places, unless you want to spend about 4 hours a month waiting for and riding in an elevator< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I’m giving a poor review mostly because of the buildings choice of leasing reps.  Natasha never answered emails, and honestly tried to GIP me out of money that I was entitled to on move in.  She also has a serious attitude problem.  When I pay a lot of money in rent, I expect at least decent customer service and I didn’t get that.   I also didn’t like having to frequently wait a long time to get my car out of the parking garage, usually no available guest parking, frequent closings of the main entrance, and broken down elevators.</review>

<Text>All agents in the office at 255 Grand Tower are wonderful. Donna, Natasha, Marla, Keith and Arron, but there is always one to give bad taste in mouth and that is the accounting lady Julie the worst I have spoken to. She is just not a happy woman in her life. She is an arrogant, rude and DRY. She should know that her tenants are paying her salary check so she should be helpful and pleasant to them. I hope you don't have to encounter with her and the management should take some action. There are tons of apartment vacant in the center city!!!< /Text><Name>Sunny Saha<//Name><rating>1<//rating></record>

<review>I do like living here because location is great, patio area outside is spacious with nice grills and pool, my apartment is spacious with floor to ceiling windows. Security is real nice, John, Mike and Mario especially.

The rent increase by about $1000/month with the new renovations is not ok. A lot of tenants have moved out because of that. Construction of lobby and 2nd floor shared amenities took a really terribly long, almost 2 years, to complete construction. There was no break on rent during that time. Having seen the renovated units, the changes were mostly cosmetic, but they do look nice. Not $1,000 nicer

The leasing office ladies are pleasant but not warm. I have not had the greatest experiences with them when I need something though. They give off the vibe that they would rather not help you and definitely will not apologize for any inconvenience they unintentionally caused. Which is a no-cost value adding quality that needs improvement.</review>< pics>

< review>
One of the parking attendants, Hayek, the one who likes to take naps at his post and distribute religious literature while on the job, scraped my car against a concrete column and lied about it. My roommate saw him do it, but apparently this was not enough to convince a small claims court judge.

As long as the parking in this building continues to be run by Parking Networks LLC, your cars are not safe here.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Incredible tower spectacular view medium-sized rooms After living almost a year I am changing my opinion for the very noisy doors people always whip the washing machines very poor and expensive and lately they rented to a deranged person who spends it playing in all the Tower doors and apart wants to steal the correspondence.

I was looking for hard to find plumbing shut off valves and Reds Plumbing was recommended.
It was easy enough to find but there is no parking except for around the corner. The store itself shows signs of aging.
When I first walked in there seemed to be a  lot of plumbing needs from sinks and toilets to faucets and valves. Other reviews weren't off when describing this place with years of dust covering what I think were display sinks and fixtures. It seemed very cluttered and unorganized to me but as long as the clerks knew where everything was then that's okay with me.
The clerk was helpful but didn't carry any of the items I was looking for.
For a neighborhood store I guess this shop would fill my needs but for special older homes it didn't meet my needs.</text>

The best plumbing shop around. Great prices. The service is out of  this world. Not only do they have everything they will match plus a $20 discount on water heaters. This isn't HD. It's old school plumbing shop at it's best!< /review>

<Review>Ok the place looks scattered. So what? I’m not there to judge how organized he is. If the people working there can get me what I need then I don’t care. And I’ve been there twice and two for two they have had what I needed. Home Depot located right down the street from me is two for two not having what I needed as far as plumbing parts. So they will have my business with regards to plumbing needs. Give the old man and his business a break.</Review>< Gmap_id>

"ICONIC", would be one way to describe it, but an equally important term also comes to mind,  "resource". It does not matter, residential, commercial,  generally speaking, they got it. And if they don't have it there on the spot, forget about 2 or 3 or even 6 weeks delivery. They,ll have it there either the same day or the next, SUCH, is the level of their supply chain.  There are no more knowledgeable people in Sacramento when it comes to plumbing. Consider yourself lucky they don't charge for advice.<//Review>

<Text>I’m 46 years old. I’ve NEVER given a bad review of a small business and I’ve ONLY given reviews when I’ve had a fantastic experience or service. For me to stop my search and take time to write this... I wish I didn’t have to. I read the reviews on the customer service for this place and decided to ignore what I read. I called Red’s to see what they could do for me because I have to order a special product and I’m shopping for pricing. The guy on the phone was short with me, kept cutting me off, wouldn’t allow me to explain what I need, and tried to make me seem incompetent. I hung up the phone out of frustration and got no information. That was out of character for me and I hate that I reacted that way. However... I’d rather pay more somewhere else than deal with that type of service and attitude.</Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Sam Thompson< /user_name><Text>They have PEX-A and Uponor products! This is the only non-traditional supply house that carries it and it's priced very well - better than the cash price at any supply house and better than most online retailers. Not sure who are all these people getting their feelings hurt, but this place is very no-nonsense. They have a wide variety of products, albeit a bit disorganized in some places. If you know what you want, you can get in and get out without having to shell out an exorbitant amount of money to Ferguson's overpriced selection.</Text><user>109209651364904011053< /user><Time>1604259693583<//Time></record>

Just called the store and the person who answered was very rude! We asked if he sold a special type of equipment that is used to find pipes that are underground and said "We only sell pipes!" and hung up on me. Not very professional if I do say so myself.</Review>

<Review>It’s sad that the customer service is horrible here. I called in just to ask for some information about a product and the Gentleman was absolutely rude and not even willing to help. In a time like this you would expect some happy people on the phones but I will never come to this place again<//Review><time>1590336527407</time></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>The store looks like a hoarder's house with no order to anything and nothing labelled. Parts are strewn and lay filthy on the floor. That means that you have to rely on the worker at the shop to find anything and he has no interest in listening to you or understanding what you need. On top of that he insults you. I don't think that I have ever had the f-bomb hurled at me as I am leaving a store because they didn't have the part that I was looking for. If I could give negative stars, I would. One star is not low enough.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad0475644f9b7:0xc5947210dbf44346< /Gmap_id></record>

Only Plumber Supply Store open on a Sunday.  Very helpful over the phone and worth the 50 minute drive to get the parts so the hot water heater would stay lite.  Huge store with lots of supplies!</review>

Very rude and not helpful.  I was in the process of asking the guy on the other end of the phone a question and he told me not to waste time on the phone and to drive to his store to look for a part he might not have and then hung up on me. I agree with the other review I read.... one star is not low enough.</review>

I've been coming here for 20 years and they both CONSISTENTLY know there stuff! If your an emotional baby don't come here! To those who are whining about the rudeness guess what.You should feel lucky to have guys who have been doing it so long and has all the knowledge to be there to share it with the public. He usually always has what I need even the super hard to find stuff,pretty nice to have it at 4pm on a Friday! They aren't there to coddle you and cradle you!< /review>

<Text>The reviews warning the light hearted to stay away are accurate. Have a sense of humor and don't waste the guy's time and you're all set.
We went to three places this morning looking for replacement valves for our 50+ year old plumbing.  Red head it in my hands within 5 minutes. Fair price for an antique plumbing part. Highlighly recommend< /Text>< Resp>

<Review>Horrible customer service attitude! And yes I did find the part but ONLY after I was able to tell them ALL the info I had, as they were extremely condescending and kept interrupting me as I was trying to tell them that I had just spoke to someone on the phone who assured me that they had the part. FINALLY after they got off their high-horse and looked over the information I had for the third time, it either finally clicked in their methed-out heads, OR, they just actually finally decided to give a damn and attend to a customer like they might actually want that customer to come back, whatever the case, they did find me the part that I was looking for.
And as far as 'using the correct terms', or 'not being professional enough', let me say that I had a Home Depot representative locate the part before I even spoke to the people at Red's, then I called (literally a minute later after I hung up with the Home Depot guy) to make sure that it was the correct part and the person at Red's was like, "yeah I know what part you're talking about", then I go down to Red's and as no one remembers taking the call I give them ALL THE INFO ONE NEEDS TO FIND THE PART. I had the part number of the item (the same number the Home Depot guy gave them), the serial number and exact model of my water heater just in case, EVEN THE OLD PART I HAD IN MY HAND THAT I TOOK OFF MY WATER HEATER BEFORE I CAME THERE!!!. HOW MUCH MORE SPECIFIC DO I NEED TO BE! And I was in NO way rude or short with these guys even as I left! Why not? Because I ALWAYS like to treat others the way I want to be treated. They obviously do not!!!
I would've given them 2 stars BECAUSE I got the part from them but the customer service there (NOT just from one person) was so unprofessional, and the sales service almost wasn't met if not for MY perseverance to get that item, that is why I gave them 1 star. But if you ask me 1 star is way too good for them.
LOSE SOME OF THAT SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LEARN TO BE  EMPATHETIC!</Review>< response>

<Review>If I can post without any stats I would have!
Red's is the most offensive person you can come across.  In trying to explain what I needed, I was told repeatedly that I should have brought something in to show him.  I explained that was not possible at that moment, but I was scolded as I am trying to explain again what I meeded.
I lost it a bit as he then got my son involved in the conversation and told me that he would hold a class every Wednesday and i and my son should go!
I thought that was the most offensive thing he could say, why try and go there!
I tried to thank him for his time, as he continued to tell me how long he has been a plumber and in business, I walked out the door before I completely lost it in front of my son!
Stay the hell away from this place!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

This place is great !!!!  The owner himself helps you out.  I have never been to Red Plumbing and not found the part I was looking for.  Why go to the big box stores when the sales clerk was just hired out of high school.</Text>

Avoid them, they all hate their jobs and the public. If you have any they will make you feel foolish for asking questions. I think "Reds" is short for rednecks. It fits the caliber of person working there.<//review>

< Review>
Yes Hello. I am a master plumber and have been to Reds many times. In reviewing the comments made before this one, I can see why the customers had problems. Reds usually deals with the more professional plumbers who know the correct terms for the supplies they need. While the people who wrote their comments were sincere in their beliefs, the terms they used to request the plumbling supplies they needed were not the correct or right names they were trying to get. The term "coupler" for instance is very vague. There are several types of "couplings" in the plumbing industry, but none are called couplers.Then there is the issue of the materials they are made from. For instance, were you seeking copper, galvanized iron, black gas pipe, plastic PVC pipe, ext? As for the person who wanted the "1/2 inch nipple adapters or 1/2 inch nipple connecters", same again, adapt to what, Iron pipe, copper, adapt to a larger or smaller size? If you are not a professional, then the best way to get what you need from a supply store is to take a photo of it, or take the part to the store and show them what you need. We all live and learn. I hope this has helped you understand a complicated industry.</Review>

Called and asked for a coupler.  The guy on the phone needs a serious attitude adjustment.  They have the part but I'm not going to buy from them.  Check out Brothers Plumbing.  They have good customer service attitudes.< /Review>

RUDE!  "do you have a 1/2 in. NPS to NPT adapter?"  this is a standard part for all new wall mounted faucets.  He proceeds to tell me there is no such thing as a straight thread and he has never heard of it in all of his 40 years in the business, there are only tapered threads.  Proceeds to tell me I don't know what I am talking about... REALLY if I wanted this level of ignorance and arrogance I can go to Home Depot.<//text>

Worse customer service I ever seen.  Old and grumpy man. Maybe I got the wrong attendant at front desk thst day. I'm not a plummer and he had no patience to explain  or show me anything I could use to describe what I needed.  He refused to sell me anything. Only thing about this place is that I heard it has what you need.<//text>

<Review>Had the French Pot Roast.  Looked and tasted like the brown gravy sat for awhile because it tasted pretty salty and, was thick and dark in color.  I don't think that I will be ordering this again.  On the bright side, my friend enjoyed the French dip sandwich.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Ordered my first Thanksgiving Feast. Tried the pecan pie tonight. Great! It was very well packaged. A little surprised with the teeny tiny package of fried onion rings for the big green bean casserole.  The teeny tiny nuts for the sweet potatoes.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQTGqvk-pHkTpWya7XYIhg1pRlaxwPgRG8YzF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeMQDbZ3KM3r0gFo6WQDB21a_ExKspqOVAP2vH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNprx67XaatARk3QVtexa8H6v_UjcjyWSjUPo6R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<Review>Extremely disappointed by every aspect of this restaurant. The restaurant was empty and we were sat immediately. The waitress did not come back for 15 minutes to get our drink order and to deliver our waters took another 15 minutes.  We ordered when she brought our waters and the food presentation was spot on (I will give the cooks that! But the food was terrible. The potatoes were raw and my daughters French toast was batter in the middle). The food was obviously sitting waiting for a long time because it was cold, not even warm when it hit our table. We had a baby and had to ask for a high chair which took her until our food was served to bring. It was filthy and I had to go to my car to get sanitizer and cleaner. The picture is my 3rd napkin cleaning it. There was food on it... you'd think during a pandemic they would keep things cleaner. I hate to be a downer and love leaving 5 stars but this is not a place you want to go.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dcda2ac640a1db:0x773ab07675374918< /gmap_id>< user_name>

< review>
Very displeased with how my May 9, 2021, catering order was handled.  After calling several locations, I was assured by Evan at the Tustin restaurant that they would be able to accommodate my Hot Brunch Feast in the small size.  I had asked to pick it up at 12:30, but Evan advised that it would be busier at that time and asked if I could pick up my order at 11:30 instead.  I was happy to oblige since he agreed to prepare my order during one of their busiest days, Mother’s Day.   I called again on Saturday, to confirm they would still be able to prepare my food on Sunday and was told again yes by Evan.  On Sunday, my son and I arrived at 11:45, to give them a chance to complete the order in case they were running behind.  When we made it to the To Go counter, the young woman behind the counter mentioned that our food would not be ready for another 30 minutes and asked if we wanted to pay ahead of time. She proceeded to ring me up for a total of $40 some odd dollars.  I advised her that the Mimi’s website, lists the small Hot Brunch Feast at $90.  She then appeared confused and asked what it was that I ordered, so I repeated that it was the Hot Brunch Feast.  She did not know what this meal was and went to find a menu, I’m guessing to confirm the price?  After some time, she returned with the menu and rung me up for the correct amount.  She told me that someone would bring our order out to my car and asked for a description of my car.  By 12:55, no one had delivered our order, so my son and I went back in to check on the status.  There was a different young woman at the counter.  I showed her my receipt and asked when my order would be ready.  She said it was being prepared because she saw her colleague placing catering trays into a bag and started to help another customer.  Those items were left on the counter unattended, so I went to check if that was my food, which it wasn’t.  A few minutes later, another colleague FINALLY brought out our order.  I don’t recall any apology from the last employee we dealt with, perhaps because she was unaware of how long our wait had become?  I also question, why Evan recommended an 11:30 a.m. pick up time instead of agreeing to my original 12:30 time? I also don’t understand why he did not take down my phone number to call with any problems, such as their staff running behind schedule, which I would have understood because of Mother’s Day. Why too, was the first staff member not familiar enough with their menu items?  Very poorly run location, to which I will never return.<//review>

<Text>Very nice ambience and service. Not a long wait for a Wednesday morning. Their portion sizes are quite big. I tried their egg white omelet and waffles, cappuccino and muffins.

Highly recommend the cappuccino, it was phenomenal. The upside down pineapple muffin (seasonal special) was also quite nice.<//Text><user_id>106757420765738969431</user_id>< Response>

< Review>
YUM!!  Thiswas the first time we had eaten inside a restaurant since March, 2020.  It was after 3 PM and we each ordered an entree.  The coastal linguine was a bit too garlicky for me.  Husband ordered roast beef atop mashed potatoes.  He originally was going to order the coastal linguine so when I suggested swapping, he readily agreed.  We enjoyed both entrees although we both agreed to ask for light garlic on the linguine if we were to order it again.  As is our custom, we ordered one dessert and 2 spoons.  It was the pumpkin creme brulee.  Sadly it wasn't quite up to par.  We would have enjoyed a stronger pumpkin flavor.  It was more like a pudding, with no whipped cream.  The staff was attentive...personable and very friendly.  The restaurant was one of the older ones but simply decorated and very clean (which is probably the most important attribute in today's world!)  Would we dine there again?  Yes we would.<//Review>

<text>Great food. Great service. Beef Pot Roast with potatoes au gratin and green beans cooked perfectly. Fork tender beef, green beans with a touch of crunch and creamy au gratin were outstanding. My wife can't get enough 🦃. As the beef is my go to plate at Mimi's, the roast turkey is hers. With dressing and two side and an ample serving of bird she always has leftovers for the next day.
We had a bad experience at another location (Long Beach) using a test menu with limited selections and a terrible au gratin, we were pleased to see familiar favorites on the menu in Tustin.

I placed an order online through their website for pick up. Paid online, got a confirmation email. When I arrived to pick up the order, they said they never recieved it. So they take your money, confirm the order via email and then it goes into the trash I guess. Probably never coming back.< /review>

I placed a phone order and waited on line to find out that it was not put through.  The cashier took a new one and put a rush on it, promised it would be ready in about 10 minutes.  To their credit it was more about 5. So that made things better. The food was great! Only giving 4 stars because of the order mishap.<//Text>

< review>
I love Mimi’s eggs Benedict. I ordered them today along with 6 bran muffins for my husband to be picked up. I ordered at 8:06 am and arrived at Mimi’s at 8:15.  I saw the muffins on the counter.  I waited along with two other groups for 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us! The two groups were seated and I still had to announce that I was waiting for service! Once I was acknowledged it still took a few minutes to get the food. I was told when I ordered at 8:06 that my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes and it ended up taking 21 minutes. My food was hot and delicious but the wait and service was not. Barely an apology was made.<//review>

Poor service, poor food. I use to love this chain. I always knew that the food, at worst would be good, and sometimes there would be something truly outstanding being served. I am hoping that it was just this particular location that was so below my expectations.</review>

We took a 4 pack of muffins home and enjoyed them the following morning.  Time to give them a try again!<//Review>

<Review>It was a very good restaurant. My first time and the experience was great! The service was on it very professional and very kind. The food was so good. They serve complimentary bread with butter so yummy. We ordered jambalaya with pasta, I enjoy spicy food. We also had a burger. Ice cream. All good food good quality good service. Great place. Price ranges from 10 bucks a plate and up. Not bad.</Review><Date>1542680911329< /Date>< userid>

We used to go to Mimi's Cafe quite often,  however, lately both the food and the service have been going downhill.  Today was pretty much the last straw.  The menu has changed,   and the service is not as friendly as it was in the past. The kicker, though, is that everyone at my table didn't like any of the food we ordered.  To the point where we left Mimi's (after paying,  of course) and picked up some fast food - which was much better.  Sad to say,  I will probably not be going back to Mimi's.< /review>

Just stopped in for coffee with 2 friend, we needed to discus something.Service was fine. There is only so much you can do with 3 cups of coffee.
Frequent MiMi's often. Kind of do it in spurts. All's well. Been a customer since you took the place of Manny's.😊< /Text>

I hate the 30 minute wait to get seated and the 25 minutes to get food after you order....ordered salmon it wasn't worth the wait and the portion was that of child's.  I would rather go to apple bee's a million times..... Don't waste your time here there's better options at the buffet and I'm not a fan of buffet the last place I would choose and to think I could bring my friends from work here.....< /review>

If you come here, get a muffin. They are fluffy and warm. It's the perfect place for a family of group because of the cat of food (American, French and Mexican). What I don't like is that they seem to have discontinued their Chipotle sauce which I always paired with my omelettes.</text>

The food was really good and portions were just right. We had a group party with only one waitress. She did an amazing job and there wasn't a single complaint from anyone in the bunch.  I would definitely recommend this place for a couple or a crowd. See you there.<//Text>

Before they used to give you a basket of bread with small bread rolls,  now they slice like one bread roll in 4 pieces so that sucks. I got mushroom pasta and it wasnt that good however the salads my brother and mother had were good.<//Review>

<review>Not like it used to be. They are renovating the restaurant. Used to have great Mimis bread..now plain slices..take out bags were pretty..now old bags. Really downgraded themselves. Menu seems more expensive. I understand they are ficing up the place...but vould do better. Waiter was very nice to a
serve us..no complains about him.< /review>< name>

Food tastes good. I like the French style atmosphere. I don't like how it takes so much time to get seated even when they have so many tables available. Also it takes awhile to get your food.</review>

I went once with a large group of people after a group meeting. The servers were especially great though in breaking up the table into almost 12 different bills/orders with no problem. The food was a bit better than I would've expected as well.</text>

The food was very good. After a while the server never checked on us. Nor did any other server. I had to call out to a server to ask for my check. Our server did not come to the table to pick it up. I had to take it up front on my way out. Our server blew his tip  big time.<//Text>

I had the hash Benedict. It was good. Came in at 7am and had to wait about 5 min before we saw any staff. It was a little awkward! I had to ask twice for more coffee. I hate that! :-)<//text>

First off I would like to say the service was great. And, I don't think you can beat Mimi's muffins anywhere. However, I took my son there for breakfast today. The coffee was not good. He had a cappuccino that was pretty good. He had a breakfast burrito plate and I have the ham and cheese crepe. The food was mediocre at best. And, mine was only lukewarm. I had not been to Mimi's in a long while. It seems to me, based on today's experience, the quality of the food is decreasing. I don't think I'll be going back. At the cost of $37 for two people for breakfast it was not a good value.<//Text>

Finally!!!
I am so happy!  Mimi's on 17th. in Santa Ana hired a cook that understands and would fulfill my simple requests:
bacon "cracker crispy" potatoes well done, and a kind server who served me with a smile plus being able to sit inside.

We went for dinner.    I had a few croissants... amazingly done!  The pasta was ok.... chicken parmesan..... it was ok... chicken wasn't the most amazing quality... much room for improvement.    Pasta was decent.    Service was very good.   Don't sit near windows on the cooler days... they are old and drafty.    ....it's time for the owner to replace them,  I'm guessing too cheap:(    I digress...  ....it's good.<//Review>

<text>Have been doing Thanksgiving dinner at Mimi's for years and always very happy about the meal and service. This was the first year they let me down. Soup was cold and the dark meat turkey came shredded, small portion and not one solid piece of meat.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Don't go here unless you like bad food and bad service. Came here with my family they had us wait 20min to seat us I'm not sure why because there was a lot of open seating inside they seat us in the patio area this dark grimy place and as soon a s they hand us the menu ask us what we'd like to order so we have to rush and order because the waiter was impatient then we wait for our food it gets here and its like cafeteria food slapped on a plate greasy and gross I tried eating it but honestly it was bad greasy and extremely overpriced got two meals and one kids meal total ends up being 48$ wasn't like we ordered steak or anything it was an omelet and some french toast....what a dissapointment</Review>

<Review>I ordered the steak and eggs. To begin with the service was great and Cristi was the bomb. Reason i say this is because, i had a situation with my dinner plate. I advised Cristi of my situation and she apologized and cleared our table. But to my amazement she immidiately escalated my concern. The manager came over and apologized personal and asked if i would like anything to replace my meal, i said no thank you. When we asked for the check, the manager had discounted my meal off the check. Yes, i had a situation with my meal but it was quickly handled by Marissa. That left me with a good feeling and i would definitely come back and recommend Mimi's to everyone. Simply on the fact that they approciate my being a customer.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcda2ac640a1db:0x773ab07675374918< /Gmap_id><name>Rafael Vega<//name>< rate>

<review>Having a early breakfast on Friday morning before Fontana's NASCAR events this past weekend, I was incredibly impressed. Having been loyal to this restaurant in past for years, was ready to give it up. Why? Overall menu was extensively with 'unhealthy' dishes as if was still Dean Evans owned and operated. Asked the waiter Javier, whom was fabulous as a server to request the cook to minimize as much as possible the oil/grease used to 'fry' their breakfast potato's. He sated that he would attempt. Voila, great potatoes as Mimi's is branded in servings, was terrific. Without oil at ALL! So so good. Complimented the Great General Manager Chris on the order request outcome. He shared with me that Mimi's was owned now by a large Global entity and had more healthy training in the cooking/recipes. Finally</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>The food was okay, but the service was terrible. We had to wait 10 minutes to get our menus, after getting up and asking for our menus twice (once asking the manager). Then our server didn't bring us enough waters for the table. He then brought out two wrong dinners, and I had to wait for half the meal to get my actual dinner. And our creme brulee was sub par (it didn't have a crust at all).< /Review>< Pictures>

I have to add that our last two visits here we're not that great.  Food was not up to par.  Don't know what's going on.  Knocked it down to 3 stars.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bring your coffee snob friend here! The options are great: nitro cold brew, deconstructed latte, affogato, and coffee floats!

I love going to places that are passionate about coffee and  all the little details that go into customer choice, service, and atmosphere.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love their food. I went last night 4/26. The sever was wonderful!! She was very patient with me towards the end regarding the bill. She made the situation easier for everyone, she came back to check on us to make sure we ok, but it wasnt overwhelming. She let us eat and enjoy the time their. I love coming with the coupons, buy 1 get 1 free entree 🤩🤩 good food and great service. Usully go to the one in Fountain Valley but this one is just as good.<//text></record>

This would be my first time dining at a Mimi's restaurant. The food here was okay for a chain restaurant, nothing too exciting. The chairs were uncomfortable though because they were so old that they sank in the middle portion of the seat. The service was okay, I did have to ask for water a few times and it didn't seem like he was too busy. It was okay overall, I just wouldn't have this as my go-to restaurant.<//Text>

Food was good, but the salmon was a little over cooked.  Service was a bit slow and he got a meal wrong,  took to long to get drinks and bread and forgot stuff.</text>

The service was terrible . The waitress kept telling us what we can't have versus what was available. 2 plates came out cold and the waitress had an attitude about it.< /review>

The dog in the restaurant didn't have a "service animal" vest or identification on. They did put us in a nice side room away from the dog due to serious allergy to animal dander.<//text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I have been to a few Mimis cafes before, one in costa mesa (maybe 5 times) ad this one in Tustin (10 times).  I love this place and I love their new menu,  I think it is reasonably prices, quite and intimate if you want it to be.  The food, however pretty rich is delicious.  I always have left overs.

I have to say the drinks are not all that great, but I think they are working on those.

thanks mimis for having a good restaurant in town that is not real expensive and good food.  Also, thank you for staying open to 11pm on weekends.  That is super helpful for my boyfriend and I who need to eat late sometimes.< /text>< pics>

Food is meh. Service is lacking. Not worth the money. Menu changes are not good and a homeless man walked in and stole a bottke of wine right off the table because there were no employees around.</text>
