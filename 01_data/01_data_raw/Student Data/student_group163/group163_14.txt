<Review>Found Prestige Medical on google for a rushed EKG for my mother.  Marilyn was so helpful in getting is in quickly.
When we came in the office was nice and clean and the doctor was absolutely wonderful as well as Marilyn.
Thank you so much, we will definitely come back with any future needs.</Review>< GmapID>

I was recommended to go here by a friend. Dr. Ernest B. and his MA (Nelli) are very professional and genuinely care about you. I was greeted immediately once I walked in the door. The clinic was kept clean and organized. They were a little busy when I came in, but the MA (Nelli) who checked me in communicated very clearly about how long the wait will be and apologized for it. I did not mind waiting because my friend spoke very highly of them and I was not disappointed. Definitely recommend them and will use them for future care!</review>

This is truly a family clinic! You will feel welcomed from the moment you walk in. The clinic is spacious, and beautifully decorated (very soothing). The doctors are amazing; they are knowledgeable, professional, and truly caring. They treat you with respect, and a warmth that is not very common now a days. They are very kind, make sure they answer all of your questions, and give you clear guidance on your treatment. Definitely a place for the whole family!</review>

My first experience when I walked in to prestige medical was how clean the place was. The reception was very professional and courteous with a nice smile as you wait to be seen. The professional doctors have a lot of knowledge and experience with my case and provided lots of information and knowledge. They listened well with great eye contact. Not to forget how comfortable I felt. Prestige Medical is a place to receive any immediate medical care, get knowledge and treatment for any  chronic illness. I strongly suggest you all to visit PRESTIGE MEDICAL . Thank you.</Review>

<Review>Extremely helpful and nice staff. I was promptly seen and treated. Dr. Emily has a listening ear and very knowledgeable. She worked collaboratively with me to develop a suitable treatment plan. Unlike other clinics I’ve been in the past, I received a personalized care and felt at home. I’m excited about this new clinic and I know my wife and kid would also love it here.<//Review>< pics>

Dr Oduru , Dr B and the staffs were  amazing and very kind to me, and social. Made me feel at ease and comfortable and my appointment was attended before my actual time of appointment. The front waiting room has very comfortable seats and it is kid friendly, I went with my friend and her 3 years old son and he had fun ,he didn't want to leave , The front looks very nice and pretty.“This place is absolutely amazing. I’ve never been so impressed by going to the doctor. 5 stars perfect!”<//review>

< Review>
Visited Prestigious Medical Clinic and Urgent Care one Monday morning after a little sickness that had carried over from the weekend before. The care and attention to detail accorded me by Dr. Emy Jeffrey was so comforting. She took her time to know me & my sickness. I wasn’t rushed like a product on a factory conveyor belt. I left with the impression that my experience wasn’t a one-off thing but that’s how everyone was attended to; the standard of care. Happily, I recommend the personnel and services of Prestigious Medical Clinic and Urgent Care to anyone who needs it. They are so deserving of 5-star review.</Review>

<Date>1582827826742</Date><rate>5</rate><review>We went here while we were on vacation in CA and my wife got very sick. The medicine prescribed by a different urgent care wasn’t working. The doctor at this location saw us immediately and took his time figuring out my wife’s condition. He didn’t rush and we felt that we were finally taken care of. Once he had a diagnosis, he didn’t stop there but made sure that my wife didn’t have any other illnesses or infections going on. Next, he gave us some flexibility and decision making options in terms of the treatment plan (for example, we were able to choose whether we wanted a chest X-ray immediately or if we wanted to wait and watch). He followed up with us in the following days and continued giving us advice. We were very impressed. This clinic treats the patient like a person rather than a walking sickness and treats the patient as a whole. Especially, special thanks to Dr. Ernest!</review>< pictures>

Let me first start by saying this is what a true, genuine,  caring clinic is all about. Upon walking in you are treated with respect and treated like a person not just another sick patient. Gabby the M.A and receptionist  is very sweet and made us feel very welcome.  DR Bentum is very kind, knowledgeable and actually spends time with you and doesnt rush you unlike other Drs  i have seen in the past. He answers any and all questions and treats his patients with such a caring manner, like family. Ernest Bentum is the definition of what all Drs should be like. THANK YOU Prestige medical clinic. I am never going anywhere else!. I highly recommend this place.<//text>

<Text>Twice I was very sick during this cough and cold season.  I was not getting better. I was miserable and I went to get checked out. I saw Dr. O and she helped me tremendously.  I did not have to go sit in the emergency room for hours. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat< /Text>< Pictures>

I work nearby this place, I noticed that it’s indicated it’s open till 7 PM. I’ve referred patients over numerous times however when the patients have gotten there they’ve been  told the provider left early. So if that’s the case why are you still open??? You think you have an urgent care nearby however, Hours of operation are not as indicated.< /Text>

Prestigious urgent care is one of the best clinics I had visited, as matter of fact the nurses are very professional and the Dr on duty was Dr Emily Jeffery Oduro , she was just amazing I  recomend everyone who is around to visit them when you need to.</text>

< Review>
These folks did a great job repairing my car. I had concerns about the blind spot system after the crash. They are actually able to calibrate the devices and make sure they are aimed the right way. They got it done when they said and it looks like new!</Review>

<Review>After a terrifying T-bone accident (we were all ok!), we took our 2009 Toyota Rav4 to Caliber Collision. Not only did they treat us with respect and kindness, their work was IMPECCABLE. I mean, they not only did the bodywork, but they cleaned the car INSIDE and OUT!
They gave us a quote and were honest with us with the work cost less. What company actually charges you less than they quote because they want to be honest and not just charge the higher price? CALIBER COLLISION.
The thing that stuck with us the most was as we were leaving. The mechanic/clerk who gave us the keys said, "Now you can put that mistake behind you and go on being happy." (He knew that we had felt so bad about the accident). It felt like they took pride in their work and how it effected our lives.
As two women who often get treated terribly by mechanics, we sincerely appreciated the attention to detail, honesty, and courteous treatment provided by all of the staff at Caliber Collision. HIGHLY recommend!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Caliber Collision was awesome to work with. Mr. Torres kept me informed of the progress on my vehicle. The car was repaired in a very timely matter, and the car had been washed upon my arrival. I would highly recommend Caliber Collision, and am very thankful that is the direction I was sent.<//review><date>1614027587831< /date>< rate>

I had the bad luck of 2 collisions in under a month.  The first, realativly minor, gave me an introduction to the professionalism and aptitude of Caliber as they created a fast, effortless flow for me to drop my car, pick up a rental and return with no stress or lost time on my part.  My car looked great when they were done, better than before since they threw in a complimentary wash and vacuum.  3 days later I lost all the beautiful work they had done in a run in with a deer.  I was shaken but thankfully knew where to go...who to trust with the process ahead of me.  Their skilled assessor Jeff could tell my car was most likly of "totalled" status but went ahead and did a thorough investigation of the car to determine actual repair cost vs. Value and even calling local salvage shops to get a accurate bid anyway.  They also gave me a ride to the rental care company without hesitation.  They were the only solid rock I felt like i could trust to be honest with me as I dealt with insurance companies and car salesmen.  I ultimately had to scrap my car but again they made it easy, allowing me to leave my car with them for pickup by salvage.  I would definitely recommend these guys!  Good people, good quality, efficient and trustworthy.<//Text>

<Text>My car got ruined by a drunk driver while it was parked, and all I can say is THANK YOU Caliber Collision for being amazing and fixing my car within a week! The service here is outstanding. Everyone, including Pat, was so helpful and made sure that I was taken care of, as well as my car. They gave me an honest estimate and told me it could take 2 weeks to fix my car, but it only took 1! They did an exceptional job and went above and beyond to clean the inside as well. The communication was amazing and I never felt out of the loop with what was going on. I was so happy with the work they did and would recommend this place to anyone in need of car repairs.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80ecf0d6974a13f7:0x41c62f620e070b5f< /Gmap_id></record>

Had the front of my car smashed by a neighbor and Caliber got her fixed quickly and at a great price. The work they did actually looks better than the rest of my car now! Not to mention, very friendly and they actually care about getting your car back to you in great shape.< /review>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience at Caliber Collision.  I was able to make an appointment that fit my schedule, and the front desk was extremely polite.  I got a free estimate that was reasonable and accurate.  When my part came in, I was promptly notified and was able to make an appointment the next day.  Noah was professional and went above and beyond. In addition to replacing the part, he polished my cloudy headlights free of charge and even cleaned up the interior. Thank you for the smooth experience Caliber Collision!<//Review><rating>5<//rating></record>

<Review>My experience at caliber collision was nothing but excellent. Pat the manager was very courteous and professional and I had one little issue after they fixed my car and they fix that other issue with a smile on their face and was fixed right away. I would recommend caliber collision to anybody because they treated me like royalty.</Review>< name>

This is the go to place I had something hanging from the bottom of my vehicle that was driving me crazy. I stopped by thinking that I had damaged my undercarriage. The manager I believe helped me he had the guy put it up in the air popped two clips in and had me back on the road.</review>

<Review>These guys are top notch! I was referred to them after an auto accident that left my car nearly at a total loss. Not only was the finished product absolutely beautiful, but they kept in close contact throughout the entire repair process by sending email, text, and photo updates. When picking up my vehicle, Pat told me that if any issues came up in the future I was always welcome to reach out to him for help.
Over a year later I noticed a piece of my rear bumper had popped out of place and I could not fix it on my own. I called the shop and explained the situation and without question Pat told me to come on by and he would take care of it. As promised, not only did he fix the bumper and just a matter of minutes he also washed all the ash off of my car from the recent wildfires.
This story is just one example of the quality service that this facility provides. Whether it is for any major body repairs or just some basic tuneups, don’t take your car anywhere but Caliber!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Paul at Caliper Collision was great. I was in a car accident and was towed to their shop. I was very tearful when I entered , this business did everything they could to make me feel like it was going to be ok. They communicated daily about the repairs to my vehicle. I highly recommend them.< /review>

I've had my car repaired at Caliber Collision several times going back to when they were San Luis Autobody. The people are the same, the quality of repairs are the same (top notch) and I wouldn't think of going anywhere else. If I ever get hit by a dog behind the wheel of a truck again (true story) I'll be knocking on Caliber Collision's door.</Text>

Used to be a great shop when they were “San Luis Auto Body”. I don’t know if they were bought but now their customer service quality is really lacking. They took a long time to contact me back, then claimed they couldn’t find my information when I called, emailed me the next day and did not answer my phone call immediately after the email was received. Still waiting for a call back but likely I won’t use them based on their poor customer service.</review>

I was very nervous at first because I wanted nothing but top of of the line work for my car and wanted to make sure everything was completed with extreme precision, they did that and more!!!!

<Text>Very professional and well-behaved when talking with me. However, when they realized I have a $1000 co-pay and I had accepted $1500 repair estimate form my insurance, they charged up the costs to $2100. When I asked them if they replaced any part, they said no. That's insane to charge this amount without changing part of my car. It is taking advantage of the customer and our poorly designed insurance system and should not be accepted. Even if I had full coverage, this behavior is not acceptable, because this charges up costs for everyone and how about people who cannot afford insurance. This is ruining our society.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

<rate>5<//rate><text>My first experience using Caliber Collision was like a breath of fresh air. Everyone is customer friendly and goes the distant to assure you regarding any questions you may have. The ladies in the front office are amazing. When you enter the reception area in the office, the energy is very inviting and family oriented. They give you the option of how you would like to be contacted with the progress of your vehicle repair and they update you thru out the entire process. They arrange for a car rental company to be there for you if needed. My son was involved in an accident last week. The other person's insurance asked who he would like for the Body Shop, I asked him to tell them Caliber Collision in SLO because they are the best. His vehicle will be arriving their today.  Im hoping my son gets Paul as his person because with Paul, I know he will be on the best hands.  I highly recommend Caliber Collision in SLO for your vehicle repairs. This family oriented business will be our families go to for any needs related to their services :)< /text>< Pics>

My experience was wonderful and easy,  Jeff made everything so easy and his positive attitude made everything that much better!!  I work 8-5 and hardly had time to take his calls, but he left thorough messages on status of my car and what not, he even went the extra mile to get in contact with my insurance(which was  huge nuisance) and get everything taken care of . It did take a while to get my car, but it came back looking brand new and they were nice enough to clean my car outside/in. I will be back in the future if I ever have problems, and would absolutely  recommend to anyone.</review>

San Luis auto body knocked it out of the park. Quick turn around. And handled my insurance. I wish the rest of my car looked as fresh as my front bumper now!

Paul was great. And the front desk (sorry I don't remember her name) was very friendly.

Hopefully I'll never need to come back. But if I do...< /text>

< Review>
A tree had jumped out and knocked the side-view mirror off my 21-year-old truck. I asked San Luis Autobody about replacing it. In a few minutes they located and quoted a price for one at a local auto salvage business (similar name, different business). S.L. Autobody described how to remove the mounting bracket, and said to come back if I was not comfortable doing the replacement myself. I got the salvage part, did the work myself, and owed S.L. Autobody nothing but gratitude.< /Review>

You get what you pay for!  We have had three cars repaired & painting done by SL Auto Body and all were masterfully and beautifully done and on time.  I haven't found them to be that much more expensive.  5 stars.</Review>

My mother brought her car in for a broken windshield. They broke her windshield wiper while installing it. They then tried to charge her insurance for the wiper, despite it being their fault. They were verbally abusive and rude. Not worth it.< /review>

I have chronic illnesses have seen an excessive amount of physicians elsewhere never in my life have I meet a Doctor so thorough than Dr. Ramawami she listens, follows up and is so inteligente.

Say they'll put you on a sliding scale if your poor but charge you for things you didn't have done like 69$ for watching a video on how to brush your teeth. I fought that, I saw no video! Next I was never put on or talked to about a payment plan.  I pay 10$ a month without fail. Got a letter today saying they're turning me into collections. For what? I never miss a payment!! They're just like the rest of money first and your nothing!!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Front desk lady denied my my 4 year old daughters appointment at 5:30 because we were 4 minutes past our check in time at 5:15! Not only that, she called me at 5:00  asking if I wanted to reschedule because "we should have been there by now"!  I'm still in disbelief of her uncaring service. She clearly saw that my daughter was not feeling well and refused to allow us our appointment. I definitely did not expect this from Clinicas and something is absolutely wrong here. A heads up, you will be hearing from this V E R Y  upset mom.< /text>

<review>The staff and Dr. Lehnhof are very friendly and dedicated to doing quality work as well as work with you if you are on a limited budget. I had a filling that fell out and they worked with my insurance to provide the best possible solution with the least cost to me. I was made well aware of any procedures that would be done on me and the cost of any other possible procedures that would be needed if the most cost effective route did not work. I would definitely recommend this office and dentist as they have the best interest of the client and financial needs in mind.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Exactly what I expected: old guys playing with toys who love to talk about your latest project. Rockler is hobby-level tools with good fit-and-finish. The retail store has a good selection of hinges, pulls, pen blanks, drawer slides, and other Rockler specialties; it's not a general hardware store

The woods prices are a little higher than the cheapest box or lumber-yard, but not much. The woods pieces are almost perfect (as opposed to the roulette of lot woodpiles). The Baltic birch sheets are great to work with<//text><Response>{'time': 1619445438807, 'text': "Thanks for the awesome review, Richard.

It is almost an hour drive to get to this store. I needed Baltic Birch plywood that I could not find anywhere else. I also needed a piano hinge I saw on the Rockler website but was told “this is one of the stores that died not carry piano hinges”, WHAT? While perusing the store I found a vacuum hose on a close out table, all of which was labeled 75% off. This item was not in any box, rather just loosely coiled with cable ties holding it together. When to the register they would not honor the discount. They said “how could that have been on the discount table”, not my problem. In any other retail case I would have been offered at least a substantial discount, but was only offered 25% off. The MGR. Said they really shouldn’t even offer that, 10% would be more like it. Another item priced at $19.95 is $14.95 on their website, no offer to at least match the online price for a plastic item that must cost them less than $5.
Lame situation overall. Bought my wood only, left and will never recommend this store.</text>

I found everything I was looking for and was on my way in what seemed like moments, with no up-sell.  Staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  What a pleasant retail experience!

<rating>5</rating><Review>Great experience! Went to Rockler to pick up some milled maple and walnut. I don't have machinery to mill my own wood so it was very convenient that they carry these that are ready to be used (with minor adjustments). The staff were experienced, helpful and friendly. It makes a world of difference when visiting a store and the employees actually have personal experience and can share their knowledge and answer questions in depth. Thanks for such a positive experience!<//Review>< pictures>

A woodworking store which supplies the hardware,  jigs, lumber,  and tools for you to complete your projects. Stop did you not build Cabinetry, or do Milling work for the public. It eats a lot of different classes on how to do different projects yourself, when you are at home. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and if they do not know something that usually know where to send you or how to find out the answer.</Text>

<Text>If you work with wood, this is your playground. I get inspired in the isles, noodling over projects I'm working on or considering for the future, and they always have the high quality, tailored solutions in stock. Plus it's great to be able to bounce ideas and problems off of experienced woodworkers.<//Text>< gmap_id>

I love this place.  I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go there. Everything u need for your shop and working wood. I bought the table saw crosscut sled instead of making one and it works well.   Prices are a bit high but not for everything.  I bought a bottle of Titebond III that was cheaper than Amazon.
Customer service is excellent and the staff are knowledgeable. Worth the drive< /Text>

Great customer service. Bought a piece of plywood an clerk carried to my car because I had injured foot.  Also, they know where things are in the store or find out and take you to it.< /text>

<text>Went in for a demo and found the presenter to be most helpful and informative .  Because of his presentation, I purchased the item.
Before checking out, I needed some additional items and once again,  the staff was most helpful in finding the items for me.< /text>< pics>

They had just what I needed. I bought wood button screw covers and then I also purchased a classy looking bronze drawer pull. I was trying to find stem bumpers for my glass patio table but you don’t carry the size I need. The gentleman at the counter helped me find out what these were called and guided me to a place online that would sell the size and color that I need to replace Thank you!< /review>

<Review>Everytime I have shopped at Rockler Concord I have a great time the sales associates are very helpful and if you ask them for advice they are willing to give you to the best of their knowledge. They do a good job with keeping their shelves stocked the only reason for only 4-stars is because they don't have adhesive backed sandpaper come on guys.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1558487964691, 'text': 'We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us and are happy to hear that are sales associates were helpful.

<Review>I like Rockler a lot but I'm not a fan of this location. I've been to this one twice and I havent left with the greatest experience.
Today for example, I was ignored while at the register trying to pay for my items.
I'll keep shopping with Rockler but I will not be returning to this location.< /Review><Rate>2<//Rate>< Resp>

Please reach out to reviews@rockler.com with your contact information as someone from our retail leadership team would love to reach out.

Their catalog has been around for years, and the brick and mortar stores are good places to pick up many of the great toys that make wood working fun.  Customer service can be a little erratic.

Most recently they are out of lots of tools and supplies.  1/2 Baltic birch plywood? gone.  Kreg Micro jig? no where to be found.  The biggest problem during these crazy times is at least 2 staff at the store are wearing their mask improperly - not covering their nose.  That makes the mask useless and puts the customer at risk.

I will buy online for awhile</Review><time>1597536995646< /time><Name>Keith T</Name>< Pics>

Why oh why have I never heard of this fantastic and wonderful place until a few weeks ago??? Why did I give my money to HD and the other box stores for close to zero help or advice on my projects?

You live you learn.

Some of the most helpful, knowledgeable people imaginable. Plus This Store Is like a magical toy wonderland for the wood inclined... if you have any one to get a gift for this (or any) holiday season this is the place to go.

Thanks guys!  Especially for holding the store open past closing so that I could get a 13th hour tung oil purchase in!

Just recently went to this shop for the first time because I was referred through a friend and this is now the only shop I will be going too for any work done on my truck. Chris gave me a detailed explanation of what was wrong with my truck and fixed it with no hesitation. The entire staff is friendly and overall was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this shop & they have definitely gained a full time customer!<//text>

Chris and Joel know their trucks. They give you a no nonsense, detailed explanation of what’s going on with your truck, and do an amazing job. Never had to go back with an issue over a repair they have done. The professionalism there is amazing. You won’t regret taking your truck there.<//review>

After being told by a different shop they would take over three days to "get to my truck" A mechanic told me about JACK's. Chris, had me out on the road by the next day. I won't go anywhere else.

08/06/19 showed up first thing this morning...< /Text>

<response>None< /response><Name>Ronald Tucker</Name><review>A good friend of mine gave me the referral to Jack Diesel,   Chris & Joel are Professionals at what they do, these two guys go above and beyond to ensure that your truck is repaired in a timely fashion. They get me in, they dont rape my pocket book, they are straight forward mechanics. They are always willing to help troubleshoot issues over the phone as well, just to keep me rolling, because as we all know "If those wheels arent turning we arent a earning"
Thank you Jack Diesel for Keeping Redman Van & Storage Rolling.<//review><userid>110677323529459612954<//userid><pics>None</pics></record>

(Translated by Google) They are very raters, they say that they fix you the things of the yrokes that we have only carried for 3 days and they already decompose and they invent or invent this thing and it is not true

(Original)

<Review>By far the best authentic mexican restaurant in Milpitas. Even though their restaurant isn't up to par to my liking, it certainly does have the authentic mexican taste my mom cooks.< /Review><user_id>110687656679018048573</user_id><gmap_id>0x808fceded10cf56d:0x5a06e652ce350234< /gmap_id>< time>

They don't take credit cards, but they have a ATM that charge you $2.50 process fee without telling you in advance.
Over priced.
Customer service sucks.
Messy tables, even though there is no one here.
They have micheladas on the menu, but they don't really serve it or anything kind of drink other than over priced sugary sodas.

The tortilla was very doughy, and the carne asada was both burnt and dry. They don't take credit cards, which is clearly displayed but still a hassle.

(Translated by Google) I don't know much about this restaurant but the truth is that it has a very poor cleaning system. I don't know how to pass the health tests… I can point out many dirty spaces and surfaces with the naked eye regardless of whether it is good or not. food .... first and last time here .... I do not recommend it but if you want to get a little bite there is this ... health is first ... very poor in hygiene this place ...

Really helpful staff here! So there's a $15 minimum purchase card, which you use to pay for the laundry services. Washers and dryers in a variety of sizes, plenty of folding space, some seating. Great if you live in the area, not bad if you're traveling like me. But very clean and hospitable, and the machines work well, too.</review>

<Text>The gentleman was astute enough to figure out that I was completely lost as to what I was doing. I’ve never been in a laundromat that did not use coins so I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing it!  Really nice and graciously educated me each step of the way.  This place is very very clean and well kept.  Kids here (with their family) are respectful and well behaved.  NO unruly urchins here!  I even lost my newly purchased laundry card; he found it and returned it to me.

Out of all the machines here, I think three are out of order; they are clearly identified. Machines and dryers are clean; I didn’t notice any with icky stuff that some idget left behind.<//Text>< pics>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>It’s a nice place, but when staff tells me in broken English that I can’t take my laundry out early by stopping the cycle I just started laughing!! There is a button on the machine that says “extract” which allows you to stop the cycle and remove your clothes early if needed, and when I told her that’s what I was doing she said “You can’t!” And I replied, “I just did though.” Then she stated she wasn’t going to unlock the washer doors early for me. And that’s when I write this review.

I’m sorry but you can’t tell a customer, “No you can’t remove your own clothing right now.” Totally ridiculous< /text><user_name>Shaun Michael< /user_name>< response>

<Review>I always go here if i need to wash my dirty towels and comforter. Machines are well taken care off, safety procedures are done during this pandemic and maintenance person is inside if you have any issues or questions. If it is in not in working condition, they put signs so the customers are aware of it. There is a restroom in case you want to go. There is also a vending machine and a bunch of restaurants around the complex if you feel hungry while waiting for your laundry.</Review><UserId.>102146608144289733825<//UserId.>< name>

< Review>
A card system is much better than getting quarters every week so that's nice. Lots of machines, the other patrons are polite. Things seem to break down a lot and it gets hot in there in the summer, but overall the best laundromat in the area in my opinion.< /Review>

Worst place total rip off spent 70.00 to still have really wet dirty clothes that weren't sufficiently spun in the spin cycle all of the card readers make you keep swiping so that the card reader  just takes more than the price for a wash it says 4.55 but I swipe and then my balance  was double charged.<//text>

<text>Clean facility and cool inside, you just can't put money in machine and start load ($2.30). You have to buy a card at $15- $25. I left due to my washing machine will be fixed in a couple days so and did not want to buy a card for that. I went to user friendly machines n cheaper laundry is block away El Toro laundry  $2.< /text>< gmap_id>

Clean, lots of machines, restrooms and vending available with a tv as well. The only negative was I forgot dryer sheets and tried to purchase some but no attendant was on duty and the machine jammed and wouldn’t release the dryer sheets. Bring your own soaps and supplies because that would be a bummer if you counted on buying it here! Parking is decent and lots of baskets to transfer clothing to and from machines in.

I will say that they had several machines out of service but there were still several available for me to use. I went on a Thursday afternoon between 2pm-4:30pm and it was dead but people were starting to come in as I was leaving so if you can come earlier I would!< /Text>

WORST experience in an establishment in a really long time. There is no professionalism. The woman working there had her whole family (including toddlers running a muck) hanging out like it was their house instead of a place of business. Her older kids were there too literally treating everyone with disrespect as if it was their home. Social services need to be called and a real staff needs to be employed. Stop having little children run around people needing to get their clothes done! Some sort of injury is inevitable and it’s merely on the carelessness that this establishment has - go somewhere else<//Text>

Luis, manager/family man, is very helpful w laundry cards, high capacity machines, etc. Clean facility, lots of
machines. $9 largest washer;  $6 next largest is big enough for king size blanket/quilt.
Not busy at 1:30 Friday.< /review>

< Review>
Many larger load washers, With only a few regular load washers. Got my 5 small loads washed and dried with $18. Place is clean. Uses plastic cards, which have minimum load of $10 by debit card. Never saw that posted. Rude attendant.<//Review>

Wrongggg...the workers are unfriendly and the cost to was is $2.00 to wash and. 36 cent to dry for 10 minutes.  The  cost to wash here is the same as the hotel .. in addition,  you can not use coins to wash ..you. have to get a card by using your banking card to add money...what the???  Don't go here...google another place..</Text></record></dataset><record>

It's a place where there is no maintenance at all. Dirty, trash from dryers sheets all over the place, trashcan overflowing, machines doesn't work, no paperwork to fill it out or to let them know which machines doesn't work, almost cero water to wash and rinse so it took forever to get a load out of the washers, and when you finally got it still has lots of soap.
I will rethink twice before going again there. IT'S horrible service.</review>

It does not accept coins, cash and card from your bank just to reload the card you must purchase with them. This system is horrible for those who are traveling and do not spend the minimum recharge of $ 10. For those who live in the region it is good. I asked to use someone's card and I paid them cash, because I only spent $ 6.

Todas as máquinas funcionam apenas com o cartão da própria laundry. Não aceita moedas, cash e cartão do seu banco apenas para recarregar o cartão que você deve adquirir com eles. Horrível esse sistema para quem está viajando e que não gasta o minimo de recarga de $10. Para quem mora na região é boa. Eu pedi para usar o cartão de uma pessoa e paguei em dinheiro pra ela, porque gastei apenas $6.<//Review><Response>None</Response></record>

< Review>
Be Ware of this Place. I had gone in for a nail, I had ran over in my drive way. The Front Desk Rep, was great and also inspected my tire and found the nail. It was packed, once a bay opened. They removed my tire, they showed me my tire with a long thin 5 inch rod pushed thru the tire. That is not possible, then they said my other tire also had a nail in it? really ? I ended up having to getting 2 new tires. PLEASE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS PLACE. Very SHADDY.... WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION.< /Review>

<review>My wife came in to get a tire patched. They lied to her and told her she needed to buy a whole new tire. I'm incredibly disappointed in the character of this establishment. They used to be honest folks.</review>< Gmap_id>

I went for an air pressure check, I was asked to pull my car to the air pressure zone, wIted for around 15 minutes, no one came, not even to ask me wait. Therefore I just left.
Very bad customer service. I am never going back to that location.  Will really think if I will get my new set of tires from them<//review>

<Time>1579372918697</Time><rating>5<//rating><text>Brand new shop, very clean and tidy and the service was excellent! I'll certainly be coming here for all my tire needs! I could tell they knew what they were doing and were extremely efficient with plugging my tire from a nail I picked up. I liked that they have bar stool seating with a huge window that let's you see them working on your car... very transparent and honest.  Got my tire plugged at no cost, I think it was maybe because it was my birthday, but I will DEFINITELY be bringing all of our cars back here for new tires and alignments, etc. Its hard to find any type of automotive shop where the service techs make you feel at home and you leave with a smile on your face. Thank you to Rich for showing me that there still are great tire shops here! Highly recommend this place!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>My husband had experienced a flat and I called around my area and prices were so high but I called America’s Tire and spoke to a nice gentleman, Charles and he was able to assist me and get me the best deal possible. We drove the car there on the flat and made it safely and he was able to give me the best quote on all four tires and with this quarantine situation was able to get us the best deal in the area! I thank you Charles so much for helping us out during this time!! Anyone need exceptional service and good deals for your cars needs, please don’t hesitate and call America’s Tire and speak to Charles

Previously went the the toyota dealership across the street right before coming here to see if they were able to repair a flat that recently happened. Unfortunately, when they were unable to help me out for that they only do plugs, not patches, decided to come here and they were able to help me no problem. Really friendly staff, really helpful. In and out in about less then 30 mins. Highly recommend, thank you guys.</text>

<Review>Went in on a friday to schedule an appointment for monday for them just to tell me they only have 2 tires and they couldnt do it today. What a waste of time.

Every location of America's Tire I have been to have been courteous, hard-working and fast as well as providing the best deals on quality tires.  Do your homework first on the best all-around tire for you, find the best price and they'll match it.< /Text>

<Review>Came here 3x and it’s my fault for returning (it’s because I live so close to this location).

First time visit for 25K service, Steven helped me. He told me a routine maintenance was only going to take a couple of hours, so I waited. After 2 hours, still not done. It took them 3 hours to complete it.

Second time, I came back to give them a second chance for a 30K service. Hector helped me and here's the shady part: I have a Toyota Care package extension so a cabin air filter replacement, engine air filter replacement, and inspect/adjust all fluid levels is included in the package. He charged me $648.56 for these services and wrote it off as "customer authorized". When I told him I have a Toyota Care package extension, he said these items were not part of the package.  This was my fault for not doing my research and paid it because I care about my car.

Third visit, again. John helped me and no surprise, tried to sell me additional services which shouldn’t happen because I bought an extension maintenance plan. I was there for a 35K service, but my report says "5K service." Sloppy work.

The only person at that dealership that has provided any decent customer service is David the gentleman who has dropped/picked me up via shuttle service.

This is the worst Toyota Service location and I AM NEVER COMING BACK HERE. I expect a prompt response from Toyota Sunnyvale Customer service team to contact me for a $648.56 reimbursement. Otherwise, I will be taking the next necessary steps and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission. This is truly unacceptable.

I HAVE RECIEPTS!< /Review></record>

Worst customer service ever, they sold me a service package and told me it covers oil change and tire rotation and it works everywhere in US, I moved to San Jose and went to Milpitas service center they said the package covers only oil change. When I was trying to call back Sunnyvale service center to clarify the staff were very rude and hang up on me while I was still asking my question. It happened 3 times!, they were very friendly when selling the package though.<//text>

SCAMMERS

Charged a $100 fee for a Toyota system update that was offered free at another dealership.

Tried to scam me when I asked about replacing a fastener to my wheel well liner by suggesting a full liner replacement for $400. Bought the fastener for $2.25 from the parts counter and installed myself. They even tried ripping me off on this and selling it to me for $4 instead of the $2.25 price listed online and at every other dealer.</text>

Avoid this place, this dealer is not trust worthy. I have been going there for service for years. And today I went in because my battery dead which they never informed me of that it's over its lifetime a long time ago. Then they randomly charged me 100$ for diagnose without providing me any proper reports. And then asking for another 500$ to replace a battery that only cost 300$ to be replaced at another toyota dealer.<//Text>

Like others mentioned already. It is worth it to call around to make sure you are getting the best price for service here. 470 dollar break pads change; you can probably get cheaper elsewhere</Review>

I had to go there for a factory service recall, initially they told me it would take them up to 6 hours to finish the repairs. I asked Olivia from the service desk if they can make the repairs ASAP and she quickly sorted things out. She had me out of there within 2.5 hours, excellent service. I bought my truck from them 10 years ago and when I'm in the market for another vehicle I'll definitely be going back.</review>

Quick and friendly service. However was astonished that they recommended a battery service for about $200 -- when all that was needed was cleaning of battery terminals; change of felt pads and some greese ($14 worth)< /Text>

Friendly service, but their appointment system is broken. I made an appointment online, but it is not connected to anything, so they had no record of my appointment when I arrived. I needed a software recall performed, and the letter that I received from Toyota said that it would take 45 minutes. They gave me a time estimate of 4-5 hours, so I decided to leave. To their credit, the customer service that I experience was excellent, and they seem to be operating efficiently.</Text>

<Text>I expected more based on my previous experience with Toyota service in Riverside.
1. In Riverside, they had complementary car wash.
2. They have dedicated booth for new cars here and it makes it worse for them not better! because you have to wait in normal line, when it is your turn, they tell you actually you have to use the EXPRESS booth. (It really doesn't make sense to me)
3. Lots of unnecessary waiting here and there in comparison to my experience in Riverside.</Text>< pictures>

Service is so overpriced! Dropped my car for 5K service and was told it will cost me $395?! What for? Oil change and lubrications...and the rest are just computer checks....seriously? I said all I need is an oil change which brought the price down to $ 99. Well I guess it’s 300 for lubricant hahaha and I made a service advisor unhappy by declining the unneeded  service therefore I wasn’t offered a shuttle to get me to work. Very disappointed< /Review>

<Review>Complete embodiment of the stereotype "stealership". Our 4 Runner was in for our 90k service in which the Toyota manual is very clear for what is required at this interval as an oil change, tire rotation and inspection. Was incorrectly told I was required to perform multiple fluid changes and other things without even inspecting the vehicle. After I passed on these options, I informed the service advisor I had a coupon for a $1.99 tire rotation with oil change using an e-mailed coupon FROM SUNNYVALE TOYOTA in which the service advisor claimed no knowledge of. After presented, she tried to sneakily add an extra $10 to the coupon price without my knowledge. I called her out and she made up a poorly thought out excuse for getting the price wrong and would fix it. This behavior is business as usual for this service department. I'd you're going to rip someone off, at least show some effort 😏<//Review><rating>1< /rating><username>Scott Mitzner<//username>< Response>

Charges three times the going rates and charges you for things you don't really need.  Be careful.  These people are dishonest.< /Review>

<resp>None<//resp><text>They have been decent in the past, however this morning I dropped my car off at 7 am, they told me it would be ready at 3 pm. I called them at 3:45 to check and they said they would call me in an hour r with an update on time. Over an hour later they called to say my car would be ready at 5:30 however I had a class at 5:30 so I came by afterword since their listing here says they are open until 9 pm. I arrived at 7 on the dot as they were closing the metal roll up door and spoke to Millis who told me they closed at 7 and I needed to come back in the morning. Then he looked at me and asked why I didn’t come earlier, made no apologies and upon hearing my frustrated story decided to ask me again why I didn’t come earlier. Not once did he apologize for the incorrect info on their google listing nor did he show any compassion or qualities of someone who works in a service industry.<//text>< Gmap_id>

This review is for Olivia. She is very friendly and professional and takes her time working with you, so you don't feel rushed. I would take my car to her with any repair or maintenance needs.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Friendly staff and fresh service! This is a convenient hangout spot when I'm in between meetings with clients. It also serves as a central hub for meetings with colleagues as well as there are great lunch places nearby if you're not in the mood for a Starbucks sandwich.

Of course the coffee is amazing and the snacks and sandwiches are fantastic you are eating here at the Starbucks.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_8aJVujLE2XTjqFSghVdCAhAar2Im7rS5rFPm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcdecfee5dc68f:0x3e2614f9fa79694a< /gmap_id><Time>1537648361701<//Time>< user_id>

<review>The on shift supervisor today is heartless and also rude. I live across the street, had come weekly here for some time.

After today I will not support this store and will be letting the community know about this in the place I live at as well.

I asked the supervisor for today to call animal control because a dove was hurt outside. I sit there for 30 minutes and another couple comes out and tells me the supervisor never called anyone.

I go in a he basically ignores me until I question him and he is rude about it.

Heartless and unkind staff member here. I will no longer go there at all.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Ordered Breve Peppermint Mocha and got a mocha frap and when I asked them to fix it they just gave me a mocha instead so when I asked for a refund after I went back another time the crew insinuated that I was asking for extras at that point I chose to ask for a refund and since he didn't give me a receipt I ended up getting screwed and got $1.50 less than I actually paid.

<text>Employee at register had a bad attitude like they didn't want to be there when he took my order. Asked for my coffee and a bagel with cream cheese. Everyone has a bad day or doesn't want to be at work sometimes, I get it. My drink is served and I notice they put my name as Phil. I told the other employee that I'm not sure how he got Phil when  I told him my name. The employee said the guy who took my order must not have heard me, but it was literally me and two other people in the shop when I ordered.  I waited for my bagel to be done toasting. The other employee handed it to me when it was done and I noticed no cream cheese. I asked the employee about, who then asked the employee who took my order, who huffed loudly and then short of shouting told me that it would be an extra charge for me for cream cheese as he stalked towards the register.  I told him I had already asked for it when I ordered. The whole ordeal was upsetting, but not enough to make a spectacle so i left. If your in the service industry, dont let a bad mood get in the way of customer service and being pleasant<//text>< user_id>

Worst Flat White I've had in a while. Too hot, almost no foam (not to mention any attempt at latte art), way too much milk vs espresso (though this true for Starbucks in general). The blueberry muffin and bacon and cheddar sandwich were okay.</review>

Great place to get Starbucks Blonde Coffee...Helps me out on those Monday mornings meetings..

Exceptional staff, mostly professionals and residents from some of the beautiful apartments near by . In addition, its clean, very safe and  there is no homes.

Only thing is there is not enough parking, however, there is a lot of traffic moving in and out so it will take you a few minutes to get a spot during lunch. Other then that, theirs always parking.< /review>

Very busy..The "Morning Rush" crowd...Always vibrant. But if they could just keep a healthy supply of those Ham and Swiss croissants that I love sooo much, it would be heaven...Must be popular, because they're almost always out of them when I get there, usually at approximately a quarter of seven..😉</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I work in this area and have came to this location a few times. Most were not very great visits and just thought okay maybe having a bad day everyone has them but 3 or more times is just to much. Sadly its when I order anything other the just fresh brewed coffee.

Today I did a mobile order since it is a busy location and i waa just on a 15 minute brake.
I ordered a Latte Macchiato with non fat milk and 3 pumpa of sugar free vanilla topped with extra cold brew whipped cream (venti).

I get there and they made a caramel macchiato so I let the barista (who already seemed very bothered by me talking to her) know it was wrong. I was just thinking she got confused its busy its okay but then she says well in the Mobile app you have to put no caramel if you dont want it. I got so mad and showed her the difference between the two. She then say oh I never seen that one.

So she makes it then says oh by the way we do not have cold brew whipped cream and if you want regular I have to put your drink in a bigger cup.
Really wouldn't you already put it in a bigger cup if you have to ?? I just asked for my drink it took more then 10 minutes to just get the order.

Staff needs to learn basic customer service and maybe reteach them how to ask eachother for help if a new drink that they never made appers. Can have a guide to refresh memory.</text>< Pics>

Horrible parking for lunch time, you've been warned.  No drive thru.   Other than that, easily the best Starbucks on Earth, and I've been to their locations all over the US and Europe.< /text>

Glad that they open earlier than other stores. Get there before the office dwellers & hotel guests show up in droves; otherwise, you'll be waiting a while. Better yet, order via the Starbucks app and skip the line.<//Text>

<review>Everytime I go in the is an Asian manager who always seems pissed off, never says anything to you. Always seems like I'm bugging him when I ask for a drink. Will actively avoid this Starbucks.<//review>< Pics>

The 250.00 + Ice Coffee, yes I am not kidding you... Be aware and if you don't believe bring your video camera and gather the evidence yourself. I was happy I had found a new spot to enjoy coffee and do some little work or study at this location, there was only one thing concerning me and worrying me a little bit, it was the fact that I have seen tow trucks every day and every 10-15 minutes towing cars away, at first I thought these people probably left their cars overnight and they got cut doing so, perhaps they may have been guests visiting the tower apartment residents and left the cars all night there. But I was about to find out about a scheme... having arrived here at 11:29 am to enjoy a cup of coffee and after spending good 5-10 mnts in line to get my ice coffee I took a seat and set myself with my laptop and do some research work on a case, as I was about to finish my ice coffee I decided to go and check on my vehicle as I read that one hour parking is allow and thinking to enjoy lunch at Rubios across the doorway from Starbucks, I thought I better check with the lot attendant who was marking everyone's car tires, I reach out to him and said; hey I'm at Starbucks having coffee and wanted to check if I need to move my car or not as I am planing to enjoy lunch at Rubios after that, the guy asked me which car I pointed to where my car was parked and he said oh don't worry I just marked everyone's tires you only gave one check mark you are ok, so after doing my due diligence to comply with the new spot rules so o can enjoy both coffee and lunch I went back to my table, then a guy approached me to ask me why do o do for living as I was 10-15 mnts into the conversation I turned to look to where my car was parked and grow concerned as I did not see it, perhaps I got a little confuse thinking maybe I parked in a different spot and didn't remember, so I told the guy to wait I needed to check on my car because I didn't see it, he said I hope they didn't towed it, and guess what he was right on the money... my car had been towed, I saw a SAPD patrol next to the spot where my car was parked and approach the peace officer to ask him if some any reason he had anything to do with the removal of my car from the parking lot, he said no and where was your car parked, he also asked are you on time with payments to what I said the car is paid for, and I explained to the officer I just had checked with the Lot attendant so that this wouldn't happened, police officer said go talk to him, I went to the lot attendant and I was furious and asked him did you had my car towed after I checked with you 20 mnts ago, he responded man don't you see I am real busy here I don't have time to check who's car is here or there  I was shocked to the way he was responding specially after he knew exactly who I was....I will write in another review the nightmare at getting my car back that day, and the fact that I want to sue these individuals but until today's date the lot attendant's employer has a number that only rings and no one answers, aside from that no one has gotten back to me about the incident, it cost me half day of work and more than 300.00 dollars including Uber transportation to get my car back. So take this in account and save yourself a nightmare DO NOT GO ANY WHERE NEAR THIS SHOPPING PLAZA AT SANTA ANA HUTTON PLAZA UNLESS YOU HAVE 300.00 TO SPARE WASTE IN THE TRASH, IS JUST NOT WORTH IT. I contacted Starbucks about it and they responded via email about how sorry they were about my experience and that someone was going to reach back to me, it's weird but until today's date no one has yet to reach out to me (normally Starbucks is on top of things like this, but this time I'm surprise about them too). So going back to this location KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERYONE AT AROUND 11:30 AM -01:00 PM FROM AROUND TGE SURROUND WORKING PLACES GOES TO LUNCH, and that it can happen that while you wait in line to get lunch it coffee there is the imminent risk that your car may be next one getting HOOKED, BE AWARE OF THIS SCAM, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICE...<//Text>

<Text>Love Grocery Outlet. You never know what you'll find. With that being the case, sometimes you can't get what you're specifically after; still a great place though going in knowing that. Cheap too!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x54d2c1566e696727:0x75352de9bd2f7772< /GmapID></record>

I first shop here to get all I can cheap, then get all the items I couldn't get here at a full priced store. I usually avoid perishables, but the meat is good, and the fruits and vegetables are great.

This place is usually pretty clean and the staff is usually kind. There is one manager at night who is off putting and somewhat rude to the other staff. Also they say they are open till nine but ask people to make their final purchases at 8:30. They do have a pretty good selection and the shelves are always full. As far as pricing goes they are pretty average for a grocery outlet.<//Review>

<text>I like Grocery Outlet they have pretty much most of the stuff that I need. They're less busy than other stores. They do rotate some of their products so it's not always the same thing every time. But I do like their produce.< /text>< Rate>

<review>Lots to choose from but doesn't always have everything im looking for. I love having this kind of shopping near home. Its very convenient. Better than walking all the way through Walmart just for the few things needed.

Great deals on some higher end products, but you have to pick and choose based on the expiration dates. Lots of stuff just about to expire here, some stuff already has. Not a good place to stock up as most of it has a very short shelf life. Hints the great deal.<//Text>

<text>The stock rotates, so you can't rely on getting the same products from week to week, but there always some good deals to be had, so making a plan to stop in at least once per week is usually rewarding. The staff is friendly and comply with covid safety practices.< /text>< Pics>

Great cheap prices with a wide variety of canned foods frozen foods fresh meet produce.  They also sell through rugs kitchen ware wide variety of hair care products, vitamins and GREAT CHEAP PRICES. This store is very clean and organized .  The produce is fresh and they offer a wide variety.  They have a good selection of cheese, lunch meat, milk .  They also sell beer and wine.  I love shopping here.  And it's just like their name Grocery Outlet DISCOUNT Market< /review>

There was a gentleman by the name of Lucas who deserves a 5 star rating.  There are not May young people that was as kind, polite, and helpful and a hard worker.

This is what brings me to the Anderson grocery outlet is because of him.

The lady in front of me spoke with his manager and just shook her head.  When an employee has a 5 star rating or just a good repor from the public to the manager they should acknowledge that and at least give the customer something to write a good review

Thank you Lucas for setting a great example for the employees to follow and always have such a good positive at work.

I hope this lands on his file so they really know what a good employee he truly is<//review>

New building is nice, but the prices increased when they moved.  If I am going to pay full price, might as well do all my shopping at one store.</review>

The only 2 times I've been there when I was next in line a relief checker came up and asked the people behind me to move to the checkstand she was opening. 2 different times, 2 different employees and neither of them thought to take the person who was truly next in line. Both times I had less than 4 items too where the customers they grabbed had full carts. Let's train your employees to not just grab the closest person but to look at the line and say to everyone "I can help the next person in line over on checkstand X". Or go around to the checker side and look and make eye contact to ask the person who was waiting the longest personally.<//text>

<Review>I'm going to give Grocery Outlet five stars all the way across because they always have some kind of good deal going they honor their Deals they give rain checks they have a decent produce section and the staff are always polite and one of the main things I really love about them is unlike Walmart they have mobility carts that actually work and are charged up for their elderly and disabled customers and that in itself is a major brownie point< /Review>< user_id>

< review>
Check out was bad, not many customers,  all lanes open, but cannot tell because Store too bright to see lane open light is on. Also, one lane as I try to get to it, cashier comes out in front of it and just starts jaw jacking with friends, like she had nothing to do. So I had to get in a line behind 3 others in a different lane, taking a good 5 minutes extra if my time. Then as she goes back to her register she glances and sees my two items are on the counter, so instead of asking me to come around to her register she goes and gets somebody else to check out. I only had 2 items, lady in front of me only 1, and our clerk was still checking out somebody else.< /review>

This store just opened in August, 2017.  It is a nice, clean store with discounted groceries and home items like cleaning and laundry supplies, beauty and over the counter medicine items, and fresh produce, meats, dairy and deli items.  They have new items every time I go in there.</text>

This is a nice store although it is much smaller than I anticipated.  The prices I saw were somewhat comparable to Wal Mart or WinCo.  Some items a little cheaper and some higher.  For what I normally buy this is not the store I would go to.  When I checked out today it was about $18 and she told me I saved $28.  I don't know what they were comparing it too but it was ridiculous.  Even Safeway would not have cost me $28 more and they are the highest store in town.  My grandson and wife like this store very much as they are trying the vegan route and said this store has a lot of items they buy.  Sorry I can't say more good about this store but I am sure there will be a lot of people who are very pleased with it.  I will go there occasionally but it will not be a regular stop.<//Review>
