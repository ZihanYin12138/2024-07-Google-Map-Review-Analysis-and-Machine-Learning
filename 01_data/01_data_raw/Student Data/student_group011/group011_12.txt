<rating>3</rating><Text>The food itself was delicious, however an item was forgotten and once we realized we called to ask if we could pick it up. Unfortunately no one answered the call after spending nearly half an hour trying to call the bistro. I would like to give 5 stars, but for the price of the garlic parmesan fries it is very unfortunate to not even get an answered phone call. Great food, poor service.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80945d1079d6f351:0xca9db072c5cde691<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Incredible burgers you will have trouble finishing, delicious fries, and the dipping sauces are a great touch. Lots of menu options I will have to come back and sample!< /text>

< review>
Very pleasant surprise!!! Excellent Burgers and Fries. Beer was ice cold severed in chilled glasses. Decent size menu, cool vibe and A/C was rocking. Staff was very personable, friendly and helpful. Super cool that they have a different special each weekday (see attached photo of current specials).  I even saw a discount given to a senior citizen. AWESOME. We were told that they have a $3.00 Beer Special during Fresno State Football games. I will definitely be going back again!!! 🍔🍟🍺<//review>

<Review>I don't care how good the food is. The service I received was so disrespectful and particularly egregious to the disabled that I will never go to this place again. I specifically called ahead to ask for curbside service which they agreed to.  Once I arrived they were argumentative and said I hadn't called and continued to argue with me. In a time where you should be grateful for individuals supporting local businesses, disrespecting the disabled is bad business. I hope the owner sees this review and educates the employees on customer service and being kind and supportive to individuals who face challenges every day of their lives.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Decent hole in the wall burger place. First time I came here I had one of the best veggie burgers I had in awhile today I got the cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the big bulldog and we couldn’t forget the garlic fries with EXTRA garlic of course! They have a little bit of something for everyone and the 10% student discount isn’t bad either. It’s not the best burger I’ve had in my life but the garlic fries keep me coming back for more. PS my boyfriend says there was a weird smell when he walked into the place and that for some reason the tables are annoyingly sticky. But for him it’s still the best burger he’s had in town.< /text>

We tried 3 different burgers and 2 different fries. Definately one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. The pastrami is crispy (love) and my personal favorite was the Bacon blue, oh my! Recommend highly, that buttery brioche bun is to die for! Can’t wait to order again!<//text>

Yum! I give a lot of love to a place that takes my order seriously, especially one that has a great burger selection to begin with. A patty medium-rare? No problem. Extra crispy fries? You got it. That kind of service goes a long way toward getting my repeat business. Try the mini-Bulldog burger, which includes bacon and pastrami. Sorry, but vegan options are pretty limited -- another one of my biggest criteria!< /Text>

<Review>This location is a very good burger place that has an understated appearance. Small, simple, and with minimal decor but with better food than its looks would suggest. With plain brown commercial paper towel rolls for napkins and concrete floors the only real downside of this location is how it presents itself. The burgers and onion rings at this place are very good and they offer a small number of beers on tap. The price is reasonable when one considers the quality and proportions on offer. Given how easy it is to overlook I would consider this location something of a hidden gem, although the local students probably know it well. Anyone looking for burgers in the area should consider giving it a try.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Perhaps you will decide to one more chance.'}< /resp><review>I ordered a steak salad which said it had brisket on it. I asked the guy if it was brisket or steak. He said brisket so I assumed it would be tender, you know, like brisket. It was not. I couldn't chew a single piece I bit into. So I asked them to take it off and just give me a burger on it. I also asked for new onion straws because the ones I got on top were soggy, not a bit crispy. It came back with crispy onions, but instead of a burger they had cooked up hamburger meat in crumbles. But whatever, that was fine, just kind of dry. The ranch dressing was delicious, that was the best part. We also ordered the onion rings because they get rave reviews. I thought they tasted like donuts. Not bad, but I definitely wouldn't order them again. And my friend was half done with her salad when she found a large wadded up piece of plastic wrap in it. All in all, not a good experience. Don't think we'll be going back.< /review><Rating>2< /Rating><username>Amy Burbidge< /username><Time>1535637721920<//Time>< user>

<Review>I keep coming back for the Baby Bulldog burger. It's one of the best pastrami burgers I've ever had. The regular Bulldog burger is to much for me but if you have a big appetite I recommend it. Everything I've had at the BBB has been hot fresh and delicious.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Date>

I had an after hours meeting with about 30 of my employees. I made arrangements with The Bulldog 1 week in advance for 3 of their Party Platters with Modifications - 25 Sliders and 2 dozen wings for each platter. On the day I was to pick it up, I had to modify a few more details for vegetarian options as well. I called the restaurant and made the adjustments without any issues. I arrived for my order and only had to wait for a few minutes to receive a total of 85 Sliders, 6 dozen wings, a huge tray of condiments, sliced tomato, and lettuce and the vegetarian meals all FRESH!!! Needless to say I was beyond impressed with the Quality, Efficiency, and Image displayed by the employees. My team loved the food too. Will definitely be back for more. TO THE BULLDOG!!!<//review>

One of the best burgers I've ever had. 9/10

Be prepared to spend $25+ for two people. A little pricey but quality ingredients, and good sized burger. DEFINITELY worth a try! New owner is very polite and very eager to help. They earned my business.< /text>

<text>Usually have great service, great food, and great atmosphere. Last night I ordered my usual big bulldog burger and was looking forward to it as it was my last night in Fresno after 6 years. The cashier/waitress informed us that it was her first night so we gave her benefit of the doubt and we were patient. Upon ordering and asking "can I get a..." I was hit with a joking no. Later when asking can I get a side of ranch the new employee jokingly in poor taste replied no again. When we finally recieved our food i had been given a cowboy burger. I love this place but it seems that without the normal employees in the kitchen things were running different.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

MY OPINION:
***Will recommend***
°but won't be going back
°just not MY food choice
My honest opinion is that I don't like the bread. Wish they had more bread options.
EDITED: I will be looking forward coming back with my Family once you get better bread☺</text>

<text>Luckily it was fairly empty.. Everyone is friendly and very attentive

It's super small inside and very cramped.. If it was busy? It would be horribly uncomfortable... The design is thrown together.. The front counter is "thrown together", paint is trashy.

They take pride and pay attention to their food.. You can watch that.. Food is good.. I would be back..<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1507252602128, 'text': "Thank you, glad you enjoyed the food!

Everything on the menu is amazing! Especially the onion rings (just ask to substitute fries for onion rings with your combo). Just be prepared to wait at least 15-30 minutes every time. Call in advance and place your order to avoid this.<//text>

Renewing my review. I'm pretty sure this is the best place in Fresno to get a burger, fries, and a wonderful beer on tap. The food is so good, that you will be happy for hours just from the memory of the flavor. Like some sort of food-spank-bank! :)<//Text>

I stopped by for the first time 3 days ago after a friend recommended it to me, and I wasn't disappointed! Bulldog burger with sweet potato fries is better than any other burger joint I've been to! Very high quality, excellent service, and a cool spot to eat at!<//text>

<Review>Food is pretty good, generous on the fries, nice service. The only reason why I'm not giving a 5 is because the chairs and stools are really uncomfortable. They're metal. Place wasn't all that clean.< /Review>< Pics>

I've dined in and ordered online. Burgers I've had have been good both times, but the fries aren't much. But if I had to chose I'd rather dine in, the burgers taste a lot fresher.</review>

<text>Food and wait server were fantastic but it was all the other non food things that turns me off of this place.

1. They share a wall with a nail saloon, the smell was over powering inside the bistro and had to move outside. They only had 2 table with 3 chairs at each.

2. To many tables inside leaves no room to walk around comfortably. There weren't too many people inside but if it was busy, forget about it.

3. Drinks served in a 'to-go' cup with wait service and the server had take your cup for refills since the drinks were behind the counter.

4. Wasteful quantity of food; there were 2 of us and ordered the only size basket of fries. It was 3 lbs of fries! we couldn't even finish 1/2 of it; waste of money and food! I don't know about their other items but it is served a la carte so you if you want a side with your sandwich you have no choice in what size you get.

You won't be disappointed with the hamburgers as they were delicious.< /text>< pictures>

Only one item was "good" that item was the fries. The burger itself was really undercooked, I myself didn't finish it in fear of getting sick. A little pink is okay, a lot is not. Another customer also had an issue, I overheard her as I was leaving. Pricing is a little too much $10.40 for the meal. Next time I am craving a burger I will just head over too Dog House! Date of visit 1/26/16. Off to a bad start bulldog burger bistro.<//review>

Has to be the worst service and cleanliness in Fresno. The cashier was a young girl who was impatient with my questions about the doggy style fries and I ultimately felt bad for asking the question as she was rude so I settled for whatever they gave me. Overpriced as they are, I ended up spending my earned money on a meal I really didn't want because of the rudeness of the young (probably stoned off pot) cashier. The bathroom is disgusting. I'll go to McDonalds next time for better service.  On a high note, the gentleman who gave me my food was very nice and almost made up the slack for his counterpart at the register. Can't see myself going back for a while.<//review>

Great place to eat, the owner is super encouraging with variety and consistency, ive had the bufflo burger about three times now hasnt failed me its just simply the best, only bad part about it is if the owners not there the workers are kinda sloppy other than that everything always to a T always the same great tasting burger that ive come to love also was the first place i got my legal beer</text>

In the world of burger mathematics lies the formula to the recipe of a place where the burger=B is to the power of 3, or scientifically speaking B cubed, or B^3, lets not forget mathematically explained 1(BxBxB) =(hence) Bulldog Burger Bistro. This my lady's and gentlemen is the burgers of all burger places. Yes, crowded into the Bulldog Plaza shopping mall hides the holly cow cannoli, the grand finally of the finales. This is no ordinary place though, fight your way through the tight parking space and this is where you'd find The King of Burger King, it's where he hangs out when he's not shooting for BK commercials. Every now and then Ronald from McDonald's comes in to get a real burger when he's "really" hungry after eating his .25 lbs burger, and In and Out came in and out of this place before they became "In and Out," it truly is like Carl before giving birth to Carl Junior. This my friends is where Rally's checkered out and brought burgers into Eureka! Now visually speaking they aren't there yet, they're right where those above where before they became how they've become, before visual appeals were more important than the food that's become the dodo of the poopoo. Please don't let the visual appeal fool you though, the place is currently going through some renovations, with that set aside, this is how good the burgers are at this place. It is awesomely amazing!, they definitely crossed their t(s) and dotted their i(s) when it came to the food. So if you want to stimulate and highly intensify your frontal operculum and the anterior insula(this is part of your brain people), then I challenge you to come to this place where you'll find each characters above dancing together in harmony to something they can all enjoy. You too can dance in harmony and sing Kumbaya so what are you waiting for? Go-on, C'mon now... Carry on...<//text>

<Text>The food isnt good, it tastes like McDonald's . Plus too expensive for the low quality  food they serve. It doesn't even fill you up either , their portions are small. The food wasnt cooked all the way . They take forever to clean up tables. An to make it worse the room is tiny with no room to maneuver  around. I was very dissapointed., McDonald's isn't as bad as this place. Just Save your money< /Text><GmapID>0x80945d1079d6f351:0xca9db072c5cde691< /GmapID>< UserId.>

<text>This place makes their food with love! You can taste it in every bite.

If you're coming here for anything it's likely their friend chicken... And you should not skip that at all. It's lightly breaded and cooked to Golden perfection. I love friend chicken, had it from every place under the sun, and this place has something special with their recipe.

Was there for the chicken, and stayed for brunch! Well, I had to come back the next day. But the smell of them cooking bacon was driving me nuts! So we came back the next day, and I very much regret not ordering the eggs Benedict with the pork. My wife let me try hers and it was incredible.

I love eggs Benedict, and was worried this place might be trying too hard in this regard. But it was a mistake... I wanted to eat the whole thing!

If you have the time (and money) to make this place work, it's worth a visit of you're around the area.</text></record>

Rustic, home-style cooking (chicken, pasta, etc) with generous portions. Good selection of appetizers and side plates. Vegetarian options. Popular, crowded for dinner.<//Review>

Deeelicious farmer's salad with grilled chicken and roasted potatoes.  Fresh greens tasted like they had been harvested this morning.</text>

<Text>Came for a late lunch. There is a small parking lot on the side of the building or there is street parking.

To me this is the quintessential Napa Valley area restaurant. High quality food, local ingredients, and lots of outdoor seating. Prices were reasonable.

The patio is the place to be. When I came it was very hot inside and would not have been enjoyable. The chicken sandwich I had was simple but good. Not great, but good. I also tried one of their handmade sodas that I would recommend. Service was friendly and attentive.  Didn’t see a dessert menu, but I would have loved a dessert to match the lunch I had.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkRGOjRaqMEqrlB_rFF_sA0N-ig0SsMbBGr6z-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm4GueqZ0SNgR6RYolBnbic-FZOcygNP2r5Juu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnc1hD5kkG_yB57t5rv26ZRF_foAfQwt5RGusw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWzN-w2jTH9B-oln-o4G0tmROJobo51LZEJFbG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_5Rtv466cK-2N9g_60k-MJSjwZi7nWSifwGc1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlC9i_fBUjls3HFuvLvDEGxiZzkPKgYMpB_I_-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsczjR1XuI5AieAD9moke2Rhx91obO6PZJjPKK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Loved the food and the staff... The donuts were totally rocking with their homemade jams! I had the Benedict with pulled pork, and it really was so good... Served on a homemade biscuit with really delicious potatoes.

All in all I highly recommend this joint, however... There is one negative

We were there on lunch between wine tasting appointments, and we figured 1 hour would be plenty of time for us to get in and out. They took about 45 minutes to get our food to the table, so if you are in a hurry, you need to make sure and let your server know that you have a time schedule so that they can meet it< /Text>

<text>Food is amazing.  Selection wonderfully curated.  However as a resident in a small town that loves and appreciates everything local, I always wanted to love this place.  I gave it shot after shot and I'm done.  Disappointing considering the few options we have in town.

If you're looking for couture food on the way to your wine tour by all means stop in and eat and drink and tip well.

If you live in Forestville, well, I don't have to say it because we already know, but this place isn't here for us.  Rosa's and Carr's and Tiny Town will charge you less and appreciate you more.  None of those are gourmet, but they are cooked with love and I appreciate all of them far more.

Also full truth the friend chicken is over rated.

Monday is "locals night" but we don't know a single neighbor that's been and gone back.

Also don't trust the hours on the website.  They tend to stop taking orders when they get busy at night.< /text><Response>None< /Response>< name>

On the other hand, my hubs can't eat eggs or gluten and must limit dairy. He ordered the pork belly hash, but hold the eggs and toast. He wasn't offered anything to substitute for those important ingredients and what he got was watery and a bit sad. It's odd that if you want to ADD extra egg or toast to an order, you have to pay extra, but if you don't get included ingredients that will make you sick, you pay the same. It's Sonoma county. You couldn't offer up some tofu to replace the egg?<//Review>< pics>

Monday Nights - Locals Night. Great deals on appetizers, beer and free corkage if you have a local wine. Live music also on Monday nights. Backyard takes pride in offering local organic farm to table service. This is a must stop if you are in the area. Enjoy!<//text>

<text>Always Awesome! We try to sit at the counter looking into the kitchen. It's not as romantic, but I Love to see the Dynamics in the kitchen and just plain watch how they do things. Any chance to learn! Plus, Chef Daniel and crew are fun.

<Text>We were excited to go here as it was recommended by the BnB where we were staying. My husband's steak meal was quite good. I was disappointed in my mushroom entree. The mushrooms on top were good. Everything else however was soaked in twice the amount of olive oil necessary.  Dripping.  If you are using fresh "farm to table" ingredients let them shine through. Mint ice cream was good. Service only adequate.</Text>< user_name>

Excellent, locally sourced food.  It's all about the fried chicken and salted caramel pudding for dessert.  A bit on the pricey side but the quality of food makes it.  Buy some house-made smoked and fermented hot sauce to take home.</Text>

I came here during the pandemic for a take out order and had an awful experience. For all the signs up that say how cautious they are being, the employee working on the afternoon of 5/30/20 was totally careless and rude. After this experience I would not trust eating here in any situation. This place should not be open for business.<//text>

Average at best. Brunch was poised to be good but quality and food inspiration and creativity was lacking significantly. Combined with poor attentiveness it left much to be desired for sacred Sunday brunch.<//review>

Cozy atmosphere.   We'll made classic comfort food with a few NorCal additions and twists that add a nice touch.  Service is good, but last time we visited the food took awhile to arrive.< /review>

My wife and I had our wedding dinner here with our families. Wonderful experience! We live around the corner and already liked the food and ambience, which is why we chose this restaurant out of all the great places in Sonoma County. Thank you!</review>

The food here was absolutely delicious! Very decent portions too! The only downfall was service. We waited an hour for appetizers to come out and another 40 minutes for the meal. The server was nice, but didn't stop by to ask if we needed water or even how the food was. Overall, worth the trip, just don't expect it to be quick!</review>

Try their soda, made from ingredients brought from the chefs' gardens and made fresh on site. Pomelo and chili, anyone?

I had the fried chicken. I was in an adventurous mood and didn't necessarily expect it to be great, but I wanted to know what really g good, properly made, fried chicken would be like. Boy, was a happy I went for it. This stuff is seriously underrated and has been destroyed by KFC. I strongly recommend you try it, it really was delicious!

The local olives are also great, some of the best I've ever had.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80843cb695f962ed:0xe917d6019e53a3b7<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>I really wanted to love this place as I work close by, my girlfriend loves fried chicken, and my customers are always asking for restaurant referrals. I rarely write bad reviews, but I feel compelled.

I decided to surprise my girlfriend on Mothers' Day and dropped by to get the chicken box to go, which takes 30 minutes--something I expected. I got busy at work and hadn't had time to call ahead.

I ordered at the counter. It was noisy, so I leaned forward to hear the waitress, at which point I was sternly admonished not to lean on the counter. OK, sorry. I told her I'd like to sit at the bar and have a drink. She said, "All the seats are taken," even though one remained empty the entire time I was there. She proceeded to sit me in the otherwise empty dining room, failing to take my drink order even though I made it clear I would like to order one. I was then promptly ignored.

About ten minutes later, a young waiter came by. I tried to order from him, but it turns out he was an underage busser. No problem; he quickly summoned a waitress. She took my drink order. Five minutes later, she returned with the first of my ($8!) beers. It had about three inches of foam on it. I said nothing, but she promised to return to top it off "once it settles." OK, fine. But she never returned.

Still waiting for my chicken, I decided to enjoy a second beer. Since my glass had been empty for some time and no one had bothered to check on me, I decided to go to the counter to order it. Before I could speak, I was rudely told, "Your order isn't ready yet." She turned to walk away, but I managed to place the order first. The beer was delivered by a different, thankfully friendlier, waitress.

The chicken arrived at my table. I tried to pay, but was advised that they didn't take AmEx. OK, fine. I reached for another card, but before I could pull it out, she walked away.

But what about the food? Well, I must say that what I heard about the chicken is true. It's beautifully crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The box came with nine pieces. But here's the problem(s).

The four biscuits were just average and a bit dry. The two tiny ramekins of honey butter were absolutely tasteless. We had to make our own.  It also came with two pints of sides. Oddly, both were the same. The black-eyed pea salad was so woefully underseasoned that we had to make our own vinaigrette to dress it up.

The final insult came in the form of chicken wings. There were a couple of small, cut up pieces of breast and two thighs, but buried under that were FIVE chicken wings. Seriously? For $45 (!), I wouldn't expect more than two in that box.

In the end, I was left feeling ripped off and disrespected. I know the chef worked at Ad Hoc, but come on. It's just fried chicken. If you want to charge Napa Valley prices in Forestville--the entire menu is grossly overpriced--you need to step up your game.

In the end, one star because you can't give zero, plus one because the chicken itself is really, really good. I may give it a second chance, but there are so many great restaurants who appreciate my business, it might be a while.</review></record>

<Text>Backyard hosted our rehearsal dinner recently. The food and atmosphere were fantastic. The process of working with their events planner to coordinate contracts, schedules, and options was a nightmare. I did not hear back for months after sending my deposit and was told that it was because they were busy and told to relax. I did not receive a final contract and even though I had email agreement that the start time of our dinner was 5:30, the restaurant was not ready when the guests arrived and I was told that I had the start time wrong. My guests were told to stand on the sidewalk beside a busy road even though their tables were ready with water on them.

The manager I had been dealing with the entire time belittled me when I brought up my concern and requested that my guests could sit at the tables even though the food and drinks weren't ready yet, saying "I know that you're stressed out because you're getting married..." and "We do a ton of these events...we know what we're doing..." I was almost in tears on the night of my rehearsal dinner. To boot, they could not figure out how to turn on their sound system and play the playlist I had spent lots of time assembling, playing the wrong music, revealing my first dance songs to all my guests.

When I showed the management the email where we had agreed on the start time of 5:30 and not 6:00 thereby proving that they were not ready on time, the owner told me that this was "just a miscommunication" - did not acknowledge that they had made a mistake, did not apologize for not sending me a final contract, and basically made a ton of excuses to justify their actions. They did not make any attempt to make up for their mistakes...so I just paid the bill with the mandatory 18% gratuity and called it a night.

My impression of this restaurant is that they take their food very seriously, perhaps sacrificing the time they have to plan events, and they take out this stress on their guests.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80843cb695f962ed:0xe917d6019e53a3b7< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1538407932019< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Backyard is a beautiful and iconic restaurant in the center of Forestville. You'll probably want to call ahead for a reservation, and for good reason! The food is excellent and every dish has that Californian "flare".

We have eaten there twice, and both times have been very satisfied with our experience.

The two absolute "musts" are the fresh doughnuts, and the kimchi Bloody Mary.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Daniel & Marianna's "Backyard" (main st Forestville) is a farm-to-table Mecca for both gourmet's and health-conscious diners alike. Warm, inviting atmosphere, in-door/outdoor optional dining, at the food-bar or in the dining room...great, friendly service and a mouth-watering menu of all manner of 'delicia!' (I had their exquisitely prepared egg-white fritatta chased by a double espresso)...yum!</Text>

<review>Not cycling friendly despite lots of unused outdoor patio space.  Wouldn't serve us. Went for dinner once before, was okay. Unwarrented reviews, better restaurants in Sebastopol, Healdbsurg, and Guernville. Won't even bother going back again.  Try Big bottem Market, Parish Cafe (very cycling friendly) or Peter Lowells.</review><gmap_id>0x80843cb695f962ed:0xe917d6019e53a3b7< /gmap_id>< user>

I am thankful for finding this dental office. Dr. Sepi and Dr. Sean are great, as well as the rest of their team.
This is the first dental office where I do not feel stressed. They make sure that you feel comfortable. I never feel any pain or discomfort.
I have a lot of work done, from the regular cleaning to more extensive work. I  feel very satisfied with everything, and my overall dental health improved significantly.
I highly suggest this office.</Text>

Plaza Dental has always felt like a personal, caring experience. They tell you the truth but are very understanding of your personal and financial circumstances. They are super-competent, reliable and attentive to your needs. I definitely recommend Plaza Dental and will wholeheartedly pay them many return visits.< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>This is the first time I have written a Google review for anyone but, PLAZA Dental Care deserves it. 😃 I had nothing but great experiences while going to see Dr. Sepi. Her team was amazing and she did a great job explaining everything that she was doing and listened to everything  I had to say.

Dr. Sepi and her wonderful team kept me relaxed during my entire procedure.  The front desk ladies also offered water or juice and made sure I was comfortable! After seeing many different dentists, I can say that Dr. Sepi and her team are the best! I will continue to commute 1 1/2 (each way) fighting traffic both ways to go to Plaza Dental Care and would highly recommend them to anyone because the Dental Office is that great! The office itself is nice and cozy. While getting your teeth done, you can enjoy looking out of the window at the beautiful trees and butterflies 🦋 ☺️ So peaceful!!!  Her staff is top notch and I LOVE IT THERE! Did I mention.... How great my teeth look? 😍</Review>< Rate>

<Review>So I just moved to Vallejo from the South Bay and in the midst of getting settled my Crown broke so naturally I needed to find a Dentist.  I googled dental offices in Vallejo I looked at the ratings and selected this office... Honestly I couldn't have made  a better selection.  Ann the receptionist, Dr. Sean, the Hygienist  and staff old and new were totally professional, completely helpful, made me feel comfortable and they're really nice. Oh,  did I mention they got me in the same day like literally within hours of me contacting them?

Most Important for me was the professional mannerism and disposition of Dr Sean who was thorough, took his time explain in detail the results of the assessment, provided options in terms of courses of action and allowed me as a patient to make the best choice based the by my needs I really appreciate that; and I believe this  may be my new dental home. Did I mention that Dr Sean and the Hygienist were gentle and not heavy-handed? Lol...go and check it out!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80857325e197b465:0xc2a55b824ea31e2c< /Gmap_id><Name>Carmen Lewis< /Name>< user>

<Text>Hello,

Like many, I do not do many reviews but I absolutely needed to do one today.  You see, I have had a 30 year FEAR OF THE DENTIST!!! It all ended as of today 7/31/18.  I broke my tooth and  I had to have a root canal as well as a crown.  My worst fear in life was a root canal.   They took the greatest care of me.  From the reception and the wonderful welcome.  To the Dental Assistant she was such a lovely lady, sweet and very kind.  The Doctors were a patient's dream.  I'm so grateful to them to not only fixing my tooth but removing a fear that has hindered me to take better care of my oral hygiene.   I'm no longer a fearful because of these doctors.    I'm excited to go back to get this deep cleaning done in a few days.  That is surely new!!! Thank you ALL for making this a rather painless experience through it all.  Thank you for paying attention when I needed something and just thank you for reminding me that its important to take care of all parts of your health including your teeth.  AND, that there are still real Dentists out there that enjoy what they do.  It surely shows.  I'm grateful...Blessings to you ALL!!!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I felt welcomed  the moment I walked into the office. The entire staff is exceptional. We need to see a dentist, so it's great to see a dentist that makes you feel comfortable, and does a great job on your mouth.  I want to keep Dr. Sean, and Dr. Sepi to myself, but everyone needs to know them. The entire staff is fabulous!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I've known Dr Sean and his crew for many years. If you are his patient the first thing and truly last thing you should be aware is that they'll 100% take good care of you. His and his teams expertise and honesty is excellent and their office is equipped with latest dental devices and technology. Try to take good care of your teeth but if you don't ( like me ;) ), nothing to be worried about. They are always there for you with their welcome and happy smiles.

I'll 100% recommend their service.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80857325e197b465:0xc2a55b824ea31e2c</gmapID></record>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I needed crowns on each side of my front teeth. I was REALLY worried how they would look. Dr. Sepi is an artist!! She created the most beautiful, natural crowns for me. She used a computer program to create the crowns and she showed me her progress every step of the way. She also asked for my input while she created the crown. It was fantastic. Throughout the procedure she was continually checking in to make sure I was okay. She was very gentle, very communicative and very detail oriented and precise. I am so happy with how my teeth turned out!! Later in the evening she reached out to check on me!! Outstanding!< /Text>< rate>

I can't recommend this practice enough ... top notch care from the front desk staff to the dentists and everyone in between. It is a modern office with state-of-the-art equipment. I have had 3 crowns done and they were painless and the dentists work with you as far as insurance and financing.</Review>

I would like to thank Dr. Sepi and Paula for the filling she replaced a while ago and putting the permanent crown both at the same day of the treatment. Dr. Sepi was so professional and explained all the procedures . She was so gentle and numb me first before the injection.  I did just feel a pinch. I would recommend  her to my family and friends. She is honest, warm and helpful. Thanks again for the job well done on my tooth and crown . I am so satisfied and happy with it and the friendly staff.< /text>

Awesome staff and Doctors! They take the time to listen to your concerns and find the best course of treatment while also taking into consideration of what you would like as well. They make their crowns in the office on the same day. I would recommend this office to all my friends and family! They make you feel like family!<//text>

<text>Went to follow up appt. This time, Dr. Sepi was replacing 4 fillings. I get super nervous if i have anything more than a cleaning done. After admitting this to them, they reassured me they would apply topical - twice! After the 2nd coating was applied, I thought it was pretty numb and let them know, but Dr. Sepi applied yet a 3rd coat. They made a conscious effort to keep me as comfortable as possible, checking with me during the entire process. If you're looking for a new dentist, this is the place to try next.  The entire staff was not only friendly and welcoming, they were also SKILLED. Thank you once again!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Dr. Sean is awesome! I have a huge dental phobia, but he and the assistants were able to keep me comfortable, calm, and decrease my anxiety. They gave me breaks during a crown and at another appointment for a filling. They also use top of the line technology, so I was able to have my crown completed during one visit instead of in 2 like other offices. He was also very honest with the work I need done and provided me with different options. I highly recommend this office!<//Text>

Be assured, there is no better full service dental professionals anywhere in the world.  For me and my loved ones, there is only one Dentist office and that is Plaza Dental Care.

Dr. Sean & Dr. Sepi have an amazing team! They provide great service and make you feel welcome & appreciated. I love them so much that I still see them despite moving out of town. :) I had my husband start seeing them as well and we're both very happy with their care. Thank you!<//Review>

The first time I met Dr. Sepi, I was impressed by his serene presence and air of integrity. After my xrays, he thoroughly explained what I needed, prioritizing the order of care recommended. They outlined his recommendations in a tabular format for easy reference. I left the office that first day, feeling like I had made a great "find."

Since then I have replaced my 30 yr old crowns. I was shocked at how non-traumatic the removal of my old crowns was. My new crowns are so natural and beautiful looking! I have two sisters who are office managers in dental practices in another state, and they are equally impressed with them. Every single staff member I have interacted with has been professional, personable and extremely efficient. I have not met the other dentist yet, but based on their office standards and culture, I have no doubt she is just as great. I myself is a healthcare professional who values the best, so please know that they are... simply the best!</text>< pics>

I am very fortunate that I choose plaza dental care for my dental care.Ivette cleaned my teeth she explained step by step every thing she was doing she was  caring,gentle,  and jet very thorough.I left feeling very satisfied. A few days after Dr Sepi did my fillings she was amazing!  she went out of her way to help me to relax and be confortable,I had no pain or discomfort during and after the procedure.I am very happy-with the way my teeth feel. Plaza dental care at  Vallejo has a amazing group of professionals.
My only regret is not having known about plaza dental care before.< /Review>

<text>I was a patient of the dentist that previously owned the practice for over 20 years. I stayed with them, I appreciated how sweet Dr Sepi is. I LOVE Jennifer the hygienist. Sadly I had to leave because I was not satisfied in all aspects. What ended it for me was all of the previous staff, who had become like family were "let go". The ONLY original staff member remaining is Jennifer. She IS worth going to get your teeth cleaned.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

New crown. No temporary. Made while you wait. Office is peasant and comfortable, staff is friendly and professional. Dr. SEPI is very sweet, concerned with your comfort and explains everything as she works. Very minimal discomfort and a great looking crown. They call you the next day to check on you. Dr. Sepi is also very understanding!<//Text>

I come here for my cleaning and examination. This place is just- OH! There isn’t one word to describe how great this place is. The front desk receptionists, Angelyn and Sandy, (I hope I got their names right) will break down what happened during my visit and they let me know when my next appointment is at in email, text, and a phone call. Always ask if I need to reschedule too.

Ivette gives me some helpful advice as to how to avoid tarter build up and works very efficiently. She’s my hygienist and I absolutely adore her.

Dr. Sean examine my teeth and he tells me what I need to do to maintain the health of my teeth. He also prioritize what is important to what can wait. He’s soft spoken, but I am also half deaf and he speaks on my deaf side, so he might be juuuuuust right for the general populace. (I should really tell him this.)

Pahola, the assistant, always made sure I was comfortable in my visit and would work diligently. Both her and Ivette would tell me to signal if I felt and discomfort and need to stop, and they both always take it seriously and pause their work when I do.

They also offer options for those who don’t have dental insurance, like me. The Care Credit Card really helps when I had to do the deep cleaning.<//text>

< review>
I have so many Great Things to say about this office I don't know where to begin. I was immediately greeted with a Warm Welcoming Smile from Catherine she made me feel so comfortable. She explained everything to me regarding my insurance and my next appointment. I felt like I was asking her a million questions, but she continued to smile and answered all of them. I was super nervous for my first appt with Dr Sepi but he put me at Ease. One thing I loved about Dr Sepi is his bedside manner. I didn't feel rushed like he was trying to hurry to get to the next patient he took his time , he was very patient, after he explained everything he asked if I had any questions, funny thing he answered all them before I could ask he is very detailed and I love that! Now my second appointment was just as smoothe as the first only this time. I had an appt with Ivette the hygienist and once again I'm super  nervous, but she said before we keep started " do you have any questions " next she said I will tell you everything I'm going to do before I actually do it. I never felt surprised or shocked about anything she did because she kept me in the loop about everything. I also would like to add after my cleaning she answered additional questions and took time to go over what I could expect for the next day. Once again I never felt rushed she was such a Gem. I know I had a deep cleaning done ,but I left out feeling good because she gave me ibuprofen and water before I left. All of the Ladies at the Front are Amazing Jackie the Office Manager is always polite and booking a follow up appt literally take 2.5 seconds. Okay...... if you are still reading stop and GO BOOK YOUR APPT NOW you will not be disappointed! Trust me I hate taking trips to the dentist because I always thought the dentist was rough and rushing me out. This place is Different! Looking forward to my next appointment 😊😊</review>

I will stop by and say hello. I personally new the brothers who owed it before the person who purchased. The prices at that time almost doubled over night.... Enough said so because of your quick response I will change to (4 Stars) reflect such a response.<//Review>

I have been going to them for a few years now and I wont take any of my toys anywhere but here. They seem like they care about your vehicles and the owner is a really cool guy and gives recommendations to keep your bikes running prime. My bike took almost a month to be finished, but they warned me in advance and kept me informed at least once a week. They called me with everything they found and they gave me discounts on a few things. They give it to you straight and some things are expensive but they are always done right. I would rather pay more for a better result, it's not a discount shop.  I have read some of these lower ratings and they didnt seem that accurate. This is the place to go.< /Review>

My street and dirt toys come here. Service is excellent. My mechanic  and  Nathan  explains in detail what work was done. Also explains maintenance to keep your toys out of the shop.  Very helpful staff. Always smiles and greetings.< /Review>

Brought them my Victory Judge for a fork seal change and possibly a head gasket leak. They could have easily told me there was a leak when there wasn't and charged me for it. They said it looked fine. They even stayed a few minutes late so I could get it dropped off after work. Very happy to help and seemed to enjoy what they do. Will take my bike back even though there are closer shops.</Text>

Always very friendly and willing to engage in conversation. If they don’t have what you need they can get it but they do have a selection on gear and helmets.< /Review>

<review>Terrible customer service . Owner makes you feel as if your incompetent. Other staff here is great ,but everytime I go here he makes it an uncomfortable experience as if you are completely ignorant to motorcycles. Constantly talks down to people.<//review><UserId.>105478216840642646452< /UserId.><rating>1< /rating>< date>

{'time': 1467997847215, 'text': "Sorry you are not satisfied.  As we explained when dropped off we would try to call you with a diagnostic in 4 business days as we are very backed up.  These very old ATV's were dropped off Wed June 22nd in the evening.  You were  contacted on July 5th with diagnostics little less than 3 weeks I would say especially with a holiday in there.  Just for all the people reading out there the ATV's in question are 30 years old and the ATV which was around $355 not $400 in repairs had dog food in the air box when dropped off (great condition) just needed fuel flush right?  That ATV needed a carb rebuild, fuel tank flush, service, new battery, new air filter, front brakes had no pressure and a lot of tlc looked like it was parked outside for 2 years. Not a bad deal for $355?  We did not even want to look at the 2nd atv after we realized who we were dealing with.  I actually asked the customer to pick up ATV's as we will not do business with this man as no reputable shop should."}</Response>

<Review>This place is a rip off. I took my four wheelers in, 1 to be looked at for electrical and 1 just to have them start it. He tells me 3 to 4 days and never calls me. I called 3 weeks later and they only looked at 1 didn't  even start it like I asked to do. He just tells me I need a bunch of crap about $400.00 worth. The four wheeler In question started and ran when parked all he needed to do was  take the plastics off and prime the carbs. We ran it out of gas last time we rode it. But in short this owner nat is an associate. Thanks nate. Stay away from here.< /Review>< user_id>

<user_name>Zepeda Ana<//user_name>< Review>
I love shopping here too bad this is the closest store to my house.  And with no car I can’t really shop much.  But I do love the closet. But my 9 year old is already using the last size and now I am seen that she no longer is my baby who I was shopping for when she was a new born she is soon going to graduate from shopping at carter. Bittersweet.< /Review>

Might be our favorite new park. There are chess boards, picnic tables, three distinct play areas, grass, and a walking path.</Text>

<Review>Park isn't as big or has as many amentities of Morse Park but is a nice little hideaway from the bigger parks. There are lots of chairs and a small pavilion as well as 3 separate play areas. What really makes this place stand out is the storybook theme. It's nestled in a nice quiet senior community and rarely busy.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvAig70c5oba9cvQ-ejeGWN7lWKWcGqC-yeJRV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><GmapID>0x809ac799982ad835:0xf3493661c7907943< /GmapID><user_id>118222736392958333906</user_id><Name>Gregg R</Name>< resp>

<Text>Quiet little park that is good for younger kids. It's hardly ever busy and a very peaceful place. They have two benches under cover to keep you cool from the hot sun. They have 1 water fountain that has a place to fill up a bowl of water for your dog which is great.</Text>< time>

And it wasn't crowded or dirty. The only thing it is missing is a BBQ but that is ok because it makes up for that with all the play structures and fun things for the kids to use.

Very cute and perfect for a 16 month old toddler to run around freely in a safe environment. And lots of tables to sit and have a snack. He touched sand for the first time and practiced climbing the stairs. Loved it!</review>

6 hours for a tire change and I had an appointment.  I ended up having to eat lunch in the area.  Not acceptable.  If you don't have the manpower or space don't book the appointment at that time.  I was told the tire truck arrives at 11am and that time would be best for scheduling.  So I arrived promptly at 10:55.  I ended up leaving at 5pm.  Also the TPS which I had to buy new was not working.  I ended up going to another shop who synced the new TPS and had me on the road in 30 min, NO Charge!    To top it all off my wife was at home with the toddler allday!  It was Saturday and she had plans so That caused all kinds of stress at the home.  I was told the day before it will take an hour.</Review>

This by far the most honest and reliable shop I have ever been to.
They make sure to let you know that getting back on the road safely is their biggest concern and have earned my business from here on out. I suggest you give them the opportunity to earn yours as well.

I love these guys!! I took my car to Jeep and they couldn't figure out my tire had a bubble in it. Drove in and without looking up into my car they knew what was going on!</Review>

<text>Friendly, helpful and accommodating staff. We were on vacation & got a flat and really needed to get back on the road quickly. They had us in and out in 2 hours with four new tires.
Thank you so much.</text>< pictures>

I had two flat tires during my delivery job this afternoon around 4:00 PM. There are many tire shop nearby but all close at 4:00 PM.  Only Big O tire close at 5:00 PM.  I called first to make sure they have my tire size.  The shop manager quoted me a set of 4 tires which I did not pay attention for the brand, but the price seemed very reasonable to me.  At that time all I care was to get my tires replaced since I have been thinking about getting new tires even they only last about 25K miles but due to some uneven tire worn.  By the time my tow truck arrived was after 4:30 PM, and we got to the shop was like 4:45 PM.  The shop manager himself stay overtime and change the tires for me.  It was a professional job well done.  Later on my way home on the freeway, I noticed I had a much comfort and quiet ride, my car runs smoothly at high speed compares to the old tires, a named brand tire begins with an F.  After I went home, I looked at the invoice and noticed the tire I bought I have never heard of.  It's called Aspen.   All I know that they runs smoother that my old ones, so they are either better tires, a better job done, or both.
The shop is super clean, and the manager is super nice.  I recommend everyone to visit this shop, and I'll definitely go back in future.</Text>

<text>This was the best encounter i have ever had when needing any kind of automotive repair. The staff was outstanding!

It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and just prior to leaving on a two hour drive, we remembered that we had a nail in a tire. It was five of us in the car including 3 kids. We pulled into the shop and explained the situation. Although they were busy, they got started on us immediately. It turns out that there were two nails in the same tire however, we were on our way in less than 30 mins. If that wasn't good enough, they did the job for free. I am still in shock over a month later.

They have new lifelong customers from me and my family. Big shout out to Mark and his crew.<//text>< Name>

< Review>
I was told 1:45 hrs to get 5 tires installed, with 2 cars ahead of me.  as I was walking out, they realized there was just one car ahead, so told me come by earlier.  I said I'll be back in an hour- they said ok.  I came after 1 hr, to realize they hadn't started on my car yet.  once they did, they took another 2 hours.  and it was agonizing 2 hours (of actual work time) as I watched them install 5 tires, with less than 1 minute of "free car inspection" and 5 minutes of "free alignment check" only (but took 30+ minutes for this alone).  workers got distracted, stopped working on my car to chit chat with other workers working on different cars, went to go pick up a phone call then stayed at the desk for a while.  when workers were working on my car they moved quite slowly, almost deliberately slow (except for one guy who was mostly working on another car but came over on his own to work on my car when previous worker had just left).  workers and operations seem very inefficient.  quality?  not sure how I can judge quality for installing 5 tires in 2 hours of work time.  there was one guy working on my car, then he took a call and someone else was told to work on my car, then another guy came to finish things up because the 2nd guy had just left.  I was cringing the whole time as I watched this inefficient operation go on.  and then I saw a bmw on a lift come down off the lift, with the bottom of the car making contact with the lift as it was reversing.  the employee stopped, looked around while inside the car as to seek help, then other workers in the vicinity yelled out "you're good".  nobody except the driver and myself noticed the bottom of the car hit the lift, and I saw the plastic on the bottom rip and stick out.  if you own bmv 5bkd264 or 5bkd624- check the bottom.  I'm personally not upset- as I don't have full context.  but 2 hours (actual work time) for 5 tires is a waste of time for me and waste of time and $ for the shop.  the guys were friendly enough, but seems like operation management, communication between employees (when they transfer work to another worker) needs a whole lot of work.  i'm only posting this since it looks like the owner/manager reads this.

I will be trying a different shop when the time does come to replace tires for my other vehicles.< /Review>

Great location!!! The best customer service I’ve ever had at a tire shop. Mark was extremely helpful. He gave me tire options instead of pushing a product on me. He walked me thru future repairs to keep an eye on. I live in San Leandro, but I will definitely keep coming back!!!< /Review>

Polite and quick, but brought some new toyo performance tires and rims for a project car and they nicked  the clear coat on the polished lip of the rear rims, like they missed when trying to mount it . There’s a few other blemishes you cant really notice unless you look closely on the other rims . overall there okay unless your an auto enthusiast and have super expensive rims,  I’d skip them and get your tires mounted at one of the tire and rim performance shops who will take a little more
Care in mounting but undoubtedly be more costly.</review>

<Review>I paid 2600 to NOT get my car repaired and Francis is in denial regarding his responsibility to a long time customer to rectify the festering problem. Now, my car is at another shop in tracy and cost 1100 to get out which I don't have. If u wanna stay on the road, drive past this shop. 1 star to too good to even give, I need a 0 star option for proper rating</Review>< username>

<text>As a single family home owner, living out of state, and in a challenging market due to the pandemic, Palomar has been amazing in their professionalism, responsiveness and guidance through it all.  John, Keri and the rest of the team have done more than step up to help with the hurdles the last year has challenged us all with.

They have been very straight forward and have done an amazing job keeping me up to date with details that pertain to our situation in the evolving market.

I highly recommend them!<//text>< username>

Our home was rented out quickly with excellent tenants and the team understood our concerns and put them into consideration during the whole process. They  won our trust and we are grateful for their wonderful service. We highly recommend Palomar Property Service.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Very poor experience all around with john vogel. We were lied to twice when trying to find a house and I'm still not sure why. We were told not to apply for a house when we first reached out and that its not about who applies first, but it was. Also, we requested to view the house at the earliest possible time and John agreed, but when we got there at 12pm the house had been shown to 4 other people already.

Poor communication is an understatement, we didn't hear from anyone for a week after applying and we never could get a straight answer.

I'd stay away from this property management company at all costs.< /review>

You were given the soonest available showing spot we had available at the time.  Some of these people that saw the property before you had submitted applications after they had seen the property (pursuant to our policy), and those applications are in line to be reviewed before yours.  Sadly, in a time where there demand for rentals is high, sometimes being a few people back in line is not quick enough to secure the property.\n\nWe work to operate on a first come, first serve basis and strive to maintain a fair and ethical application process.  Further, we update parties as soon as we have information that we can share.  At the time of your review, we were still reviewing applications that were in line ahead of you.'}< /resp>

I have confidence in Palomar Property Management. They have managed my Escondido property for about eight years. They do annual inspections and keep me informed about the condition of my property    My property has never set empty   They promptly find a responsible tenant that pay a fair monthly rent. I had a problem tenant when Palomar management took over and they took care of that issue as promptly as could be expected   I would recommend their service.

When a water pipe broke in the wall of our tenants' unit, Palomar contacted us immediately and took action. They took pictures and worked with our insurance company so a claim could be filed. They were responsive to both our tenants and the neighbor who was impacted by the leak. That was six years ago and Palomar continues to solve problems efficiently today.<//review>

Palomar property management abandoned me one month out from PM agreement expiration date to deal with a tenant on my own.  What's the use of having a property manager?  This was the 2nd property manager I retained in North San Diego County, the first of whom went to jail for fraud.  Real estate investing was suppose to have  been an exciting, positive new experience  as a senior retiring in San Diego county.  Instead, it has so far been an eye opening, experientially confusing and challenged world. Forget the retirement part.  Not to be daunted, scaring seniors out of California  is not the answer.  The weather is still beautiful and the taxes are high everywhere.< /text>

I am a small owner / landlord. I found Palomar Property Services on the internet and asked them to find me a tenant. They are enthusiastic and upbeat team.  I met John, Carina, and some other of their staff members.  They found me a nice young family. Things are working fine. Thumbs up for Palomar Property Services.<//Text>

I agree with the other bad review. The house I rented was filthy when I moved in. I cleaned and made it livable. Due to a tragedy in my family, I had to move out after only 6 weeks.

I left it in much better condition than when I moved in. I didn’t expect to get my deposit back, however they told me I would get a partial refund depending on how long it took to re-rent.

It was vacant for one month. They took my entire deposit plus charged me almost $700 more. They gave me bills for cleaning, landscaping and repairs. I left the place clean and nothing broken except for the things that were broken when I moved in that they never repaired or replaced.

In all I paid over $6000 to live in an old dirty duplex for six weeks. This company is pitiful. I agree don’t walk away RUN away!</Text>

<Text>Palomar propery is an excellent company. I have been renting almost 4 years. They are always there for me when I need a repair. They have a 24 hour emergency number. They also make every things more easy for me like pay my rent online, sending my contract by e-mail or a requests for repair, and They can help you  find a new home for sale if you are thinking in buy a house instead of renting.</Text>< pictures>

I recently purchased a home from Palomar Property Services. Ryan Cabral was the real estate agent I worked with. I am a first time home buyer and I was extremely nervous about the whole process. Ryan made me feel at ease, he was patient, informative, and professional throughout the process. I highly recommend Ryan and I would definitely use his services in the future!</review>

<review>A year ago I got a new job in the Carlsbad-Oceanside-Vista area, was looking for place to live, exhausting many-many apartment complexes, all look the same, I do not like that style, ended up wasting my time. Then I found Granny Flat. They call it Granny Flat because of the flooring is actually made of granite tiles. Granny Flat is a two-room unit in a bigger house, the main living space is upstairs, rented out separately.  When I step out on my patio I see a half an acre beautiful garden  spotted with fruit trees.  From the patio and the garden side living room I have a view to the East and when I walk into the garden I pick my oranges and lemons from the trees and squeeze them to drink a minute later.  Palomar  Property  Management takes very good care of this fortunate dwelling that I call my home. John keeps his eye on it, he calls me when we need to talk and Alysia is my direct contact, she is very knowledgeable to answer any question I have.  I do not own Granny Flat, I only rent Granny Flat, but Palomar Property Management makes sure this is my home.</review>< pictures>

<text>Ryan Cabral at Palomar Property Services deserves these five starts!  Working with me, he deserves a Purple Heart!!! I am “that” client from hell, but with Ryan’s professionalism and knowledge he helped me get into the property I wanted!  He went out of his way and always seemed like he was going that extra mile for me and my family!  He showed me houses I wanted to see and got me into our dream home.  If you want a pro that will treat you like family, call on Rayan!!!!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

John and his team at Palomar Property Services sold our home in 8 days!  More importantly, they walked us through every step of the process beginning a year ago when we decided we were ready to sell.  John helped us to make decisions about improvements and repairs that were appropriate and/or necessary.  When we were nervous and stressed, John talked us through it.  Devin did a wonderful job representing our home at it's only Open House and worked with us throughout the offer and sales process.  We highly recommend Palomar Property Services.< /text>

<text>After living in my condo for 10 years, I moved out and was looking to rent it out. I was referred to Palomar Property Services for property management and the transition could have not been smoother. My agent was Ryan Cabral. He was well spoken, eased all my concernes, and very professional. I would choose them again.</text>< Rating>

<Text>This place pretends to have great customer service, but beware! Once you give them your money for an order you better make sure they get the order correct - I have placed a huge order and nothing has been delivered as promised. The color of the sofa was wrong and I still have not been compensated. I have a completely different sofa then the one i ordered and nothing has been done to fix this and its just been a headache dealing with them for over a year! This place has a long way to go in terms of service, customer satisfaction, and courtesy. I would never buy anything from them again.</Text>< Pics>

Went to check Natuzzi sofa during summer sale and met sale associate Bonnie Long so professional and helpful. She showed all sofas in our budget and toured entire collections they have and pointed all good and bad aspects with each recliner sofa. It took long for us to choose one so ordered it on the second visit. She has so much knowledge about materials, quality of leather and color choices so she helped me to pick right grit leather and color.
It took 4.5 month to receive the sofa produced in italy as Bonnie informed us from the first time so she arranged loaner sofa meanwhile we can use at home. The staff delivered loaner on time when we requested and took it back when my ordered sofa’s delivery day. We are very happy with the purchase and appreciative to Bonnie!<//Text>

<text>OMG! This place has the most gorgeous furniture. It is not inexpensive by any stretch of the imagination, but everything is extremely well made. Furniture is from Italy & USA but do carry Chinese made for budget conscious. Custom orders may take up to 9 mos.
There's choices for everyone from rustic to ultra-modern. Their sales are very very good. And their Associates are all super helpful. I would say the one drawback is that they charge an awful lot for delivery. They wanted $150 to come three miles and deliver a table. I paid a private individual to do it for a whole lot less. If they would get rid of that policy and improve their rates I would give them the 5th star<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2b8df11710fb9:0x8fc6506abbb2316<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Bad customer service. Unfortunately they don't care. Bought some furniture and it is falling apart after very little use. They appear to have good quality,  but it's just a cover. ...sad<//review>

<Text>Don't buy from Rapport. They don't stand behind their furniture. We had problems with a dining room table which they couldn't fix. Now a coffee table has developed cracks in the base and they refuse to replace or repair. If you're smart you'll shop elsewhere.</Text><user_name>Richard Kamins</user_name>< Date>

<Review>Don't buy from Rapport. I had problems with a living table which they couldn't fix. But they refuse to replace or repair even table has cracked but i never find craced piece from the prastic bag.  i am sure they knew it and sent it to me.    They have very nice furniture but you never trust Sales, Shipping, even Owner !   I lost huge money.  Now my cresit card company try to complain for money back to me.

<Text>Small, but relaxing B&B located in central LA in an historic private home.  Not fancy, but well run by an engaging owner and lovely staff.
Wonderful cooked to order breakfast served daily.  Feels more like staying with family and friends.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyUoQIIIwFQ5cb2ekPsGSxqGNGc-xGxFWFlC5C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFYEl7e0FFWp00jfrdLxvgbi12r-CmE2r7f1hk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAByPGhaA062QtpwrpZpR1gAGtj58IDzFsGapg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5RkKDeyjqyqrYvO8Th_wI5R0iMFUPF3TO0w9w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWITXKEseoFkXW3Xu4FrPC-NQ2tGhEGSQVOdUo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb9w3HRWx2K42cgtNhPEVeIWNgypFW7Pm-CxzK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8XMlgRISNGYolIn-b4fHeSyJ5XUxlCT6Jn9Vl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP11T4r-yWyLRECQjDimj5jsnqWLDtPwbruudso=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO2CmonQzA2TK8lAybzgl427tmeuP29sTF4SM1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9q5-CR5E1cxM9xWhlWqtmdW6XqAoP4iyX7fJe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeHA5nW_irFm0v5K6MYvwnfpUSZJXqXzIM9dVT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKeceXwS0ds7b4iq-i5NDW_44uBN4eMSdZHTns=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtcKd5wibJnn5ZeEXR5e_PlCN6zMnMQ9FXxHxT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJcPOxRl0Hz_Ssw6nYwzlqaw1z4SHklc2AacGN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmikg4cw3ECpeRzcZhT31cLCWU4jJzM4ANghaU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXYzD5pCcGoJOXrBEqFvNnYL9kREbiV24h2YaJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfdNxzuVVQRq_apIAZn6Pwq6AnDCdC73gygVWH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbwo59mmP244OUeiWnq5zakREDNWarBGzMmlT2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5HXrAuJRiQxlIoqtsEVzGlxd_VsrArMUqKrXc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAxWMAE3UOXT7M7-Rw_xlFXgr0o0D95gFfrVCu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwg5-17HRbkPlReixfWrQ8I-fKiajucGUbXQKV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNB0ZSXZ5N4kpesfIExHJmi6RHLaz38qSw8CgD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdLeE_1KhugGaAF8s3fOamjKJibpjLL7NjdPlq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMNcMBEGJ01CIqcwfVS-CIzBug0uxWeXTGm6I6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxOJxeSS0T5Gik9mv6i5eHbWE9ROOW8D_npo6o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUT9HD7L_6JZFF-MYmVbxaMipW47zDmvliNc99=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObWvyyL9y3A2aeTl7EjpNXrwZ72SquZYws81hq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6U7EB3Wz-SCetTl4akFTQD7OOhFa73dfpTiJ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbWp1PHz6MNwNW-bEiXTfvfwVyyQ_3nFY3XzLu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdANFu0GNU9_94gjOYMhynClVW3LE5st0IzXuK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwxikQvACZLUSoxhxJGh4IxvkXq086_d8XuZUL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1EJn1Lnh6jvyJ9Gfd9fTy3fm2_JH_YCTqkiFK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b93de180a3bf:0x92afdf779210dc36<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Found this little gem on our first stay in Hollywood. We got the cozy guest cottage that was very homey and clean with comfy pillows. It is nothing extravagant or fancy but it was just what we were looking for. The owner is very nice and helpful. Best of all parking is included in price. It is also within walking distance to food and other businesses. Perfect location. If your looking for something affordable, unique with a good location give this place a try. We will be back. Thank you!<//text>< name>

Absolutely my wife and I had a fantastic time staying here. The building is an old mansion which gives a quaint atmosphere that you're walking do somebody's well-designed house. We stayed the Hollywood room which was spacious and tucked away at the top of the stairs. The chef makes fresh breakfast in the morning at a communal table. Great coffee great company great prices. This is one of those hidden gems in LA. Stay here if you were going to be visiting one of the many consulates in the area since they are literally a 10 to 20 minute walk away. I would stay here again and again and again.<//text>

<userid>102002931887427249695< /userid><Review>The perfect bad and breakfast. For almost 150 usd per night you get to stay at this beautify decorated home in a great location in Beverly Hills.you really feel at home. Diana (owner) is the most friendly person. Very open and welcoming. Rooms are just what you need, comfortable bed, clean bathroom  (private or shared) WiFi, Cable and an amazingly well served breakfast.
Please say hi to the Chef! If you are nice to her she will treat you like a Mom.<//Review>< Pictures>

Beautiful Spanish mansion B&B. No a/c but you don't need it bc of the thick adobe walls. Wonderful accommodating host, super comfy bed, and a delicious breakfast cooked to order by their in-house chef. The only drawback is the narrow driveway and cramped parking lot on a busy street.<//Review>

We arrived at Cinema Suites B&B warmly greeted by Michael! He escorted us to our rooms, very comfortable! I slept really well, and only 10 miles for LAX.
The breakfast was so delicious. The chef made my special request. Did I mention, the fresh squeezed OJ?  If you get the opportunity, stay here and leave refreshed!</Review>

Very nice rooms, loved the premium movie channels. Close to downtown and the pacific coast, everything you need is less than 15 minutes away. Convenient parking. Friendly and talkative staff. Highly recommended and I will stay here again when I come back.</text>

I stayed at this place because it was cheap and close to where I needed to go. It's a mom and pop place and run like one. They give you the kitchen and most of the ground floor to work with. It's not beautiful but it is relatively clean and well maintained. The major downsides were that the WiFi doesn't work well, the room is tiny (8x9ft,the bed takes up most of the room space), the fruit in the basket was somewhat old and rotten, and the people in charge were not always accessible except during daylight hours. Not bad but you get what you pay for.< /text>

Really excellent place. Incredible breakfast, the help was super nice, and the mattress was actually comfortable. The place feels well cared for as well. They were super accomodating and allowed us to alter our reservation to add a rollaway when a friend wanted to stay with us overnight so she wouldn't have to drive home exhausted. Would definitely stay again!</Text>

What a disappointment. Very hard to find, Not what I expected from a B&B, I left immediately, didn't stay overnight. The bed linens are old, the kitchen smelled of vinegar and I was turned off from the gentleman who was friendly tho not wearing shoes, just thought it would be a pristine place with professionalism.  Not worth the money and pictures are deceiving.<//Text>

The service at Perry Ford was better than expected. The service manager Patrick is so professional, respectful, and helpful. He took care of the unique situation, as I was getting ready to travel out of state and I couldn’t be there.Patrick took care of all repairs and care of our Explorer. Peace of mind is what Patrick gave us beyond the call of duty. A great asset to Perry Ford.<//Review>

There is an additional suggestion I would recommend with regular service is washing car or vacuuming. This could add the person service to the repeat  customers.</Review>< pics>

<text>.......SCROLL DOWN FOR UPDATE
On 4/19/2021 I called the Perry Ford dealership in National City because I found the perfect 2021 Ranger with the package that fit my needs. I spoke with Marvin a sales representative and asked if this specific car was available, he said yes. I asked him to put it aside as I would be driving 90 miles away. On 4/20/2021 I arrived at 930am and called Marvin. As I arrive he brings out a completely different truck. Automatically I was upset, due to driving so long just to see a completely different truck. Color, model and trim were all wrong. I needed to test drive it anyway, so I did. I really loved the truck. I noticed it already had 520 miles on it, Marvin said it was test driven a few times. I convinced myself to purchase this vehicle because I really loved it. Once I was approved things in finance felt very rushed. At the end they came up with this acknowledgment that I had to sign stating that I knew it was an “UNWIND”. I was really upset because I had no prior knowledge of that. Had I known I would have chosen a different vehicle. Since I had signed everything including my trade-in info, I felt pressured to finish the paperwork. Overall I would not buy at this dealership.

Update..... a couple of days after my review I get a phone call from a manager at this dealership “Scott”.
He asked if there was anything he could do to fix the situation, to which I replied “yes, you can give me the car I went in for” he said he can give me oil changes for 2 years. I hardly felt like this dealership even tried to resolve my situation. More like they just wanted to shut me up by giving me free stuff. I’d rather have the car I wanted..  at this point I’m actually not even wanting to deal with the hassle. I’m just gonna trade my ranger in for a Toyota Tacoma or a Chevy canyon. Unless Ford can fix this, I won’t be recommending this dealership or this motor company.</text><date>1622079996907< /date></record>

We just bought the 2021 Ford bronco. We were assisted by Eric who did everything he could to make sure we left with the right car, and at a price we could afford. Excellent customer and prompt service - we were in and out within 3 hours including signing all paperwork, and there was one person ahead of us. If you know anything about car dealerships, you know how long it can take once you buy a car. Unbelievably pleased with our purchase and our experience.

We will definitely be heading to Perry Ford for our next car purchase !<//Review>

If you want your car serviced at this location, request Renato.  Great service tech and customer service skills to suit your needs.  Long story short, crankshaft positioning sensor went out and Renato kept me up to date while it was being taken care of.  Problem solved.  Be warned that many dealers often don't carry stock for a lot of parts these days, so be prepared for a wait if you need something ordered.<//text>

My service with Juan + Perry Ford are always exceptional!! They take their time and are very knowledgeable about the work they do. I drive an hour    to SD just to get my 2011 LINCOLN serviced here and refuse to go elsewhere. Thank you so so much for consistently providing quality service and being successful at communicating what needs to be done as a team. Juan makes the process very simple each time. He is the best !<//Review>

It was hard getting a car to fit my personal needs. My hubsand is disabled and the car started me off with his walker wouldn't fit in the car. This was enterprise, it had to be a Ford. I had to take care of grandchildren and it was difficult to put them in car and walker. I kept telling Enterprise the problem and kept saying that it had to be a Ford car in order for Fjord to pay. Perry Ford did the work but they said it was hard getting the parts. This interaction made me really think if I would purchase another Ford because of what I had to go through in waiting for my to be fixed. Patrick my service tech was good but no power in handling my situation with a rental. I do want to experience that again.</review>

< Review>
I have been bringing my Ford Escape Hybrid to Perry Ford In National City for about 4 years now.  On this most recent service I was helped by Patrick.  He’s was very pleasant and explained things well.  He also was very helpful with all my questions regarding further services that I plan to have done. I will be returning to Perry Ford and look forward to working with Patrick in the future.</Review>

<Review>The National City Mile of Cars is the place for one stop car shopping. We chose our new Ford Edge and are happy with our purchase. A great deal and awesome customer service. We checked out other places, but they had us running back to Andy May. He was polite, professional and made us feel comfortable through the whole process.We’re looking forward to many years of fun with our new Ford. Thanks to all at Perry Ford for being an integral part of our community. Come see them and get your next ride!< /Review><gmapID>0x80d9526ab37b6f9b:0xbd37bbd8b865f01e</gmapID><userid>115125359236634475653</userid>< Name>

< Review>
We needed a vehicle fast. We did our research and knew what we wanted,  and how much we wanted to pay.  I called and spoke with the Sales Manager. He got our info,  crunched the numbers and had everything approved within 30 mins!  We made arrangements to come pick up our new car the next day!

From first call, to sales to financing....everything was easy,  and efficient.... I'll always go see the team at Perry Ford!< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Overall the service team provides timely and clear communication with the customer on repair issues. The only weak link I have experienced is a lack of acknowledgment to the customer is when you arrive to drop your vehicle off. On my last visit I was the only customer at the drop off area standing right outside the office and it was over 5 minutes for someone to asked if I had been helped. Now I don't expect to be mobbed when arriving but at least a "hello we'll be right with you" would go a long way. This wasn't my 1st experience with this situation or else I would not of even mentioned it.< /Review>< pics>

Patrick has always given me great service. I only put 4 stars this time not because of anything Patrick did. I did it because the first time I brought my car in for the door lock recall they only the driver side locks. This time they finally fixed them all. I would not have known that if Ford hadn't send me instructions on how to check if they had been done.
So 4 stars because I had to come back a second time to fix my door locks.< /text>

I Recently brought my F-150 in for some routine maintenance and fix an out tail light. When I received the vehicle back it was still having a minor malfunction. Renato, from the service department, was extremely helpful in resolving the issue and took care of the problem without any extra charges. This is the type of costumer service that will keep me coming back. Thank you.< /text>

They lie and tell you your going to get a discount for AAA then they tell you oh we had to service the car so can’t lower it. Then you go and get told that the car sold. You get a message telling you it’s available you ask if you are sure they reassure you. You go there and guess what car is in service and can’t get it out! You look at reviews and they are horrible!  You still go to look at the car and the car is dirty, wipers don’t work and it’s idling high! You took it to the shop?!?! Zero customer support after the test drive.

Tony Cubano, service, has always been a great person to talk to. Shows concern about your vehicle about what repairs are needed for your vehicle.

However, your cashiers department needs to be more attentive to the customer. He was more concerned about talking to his coworker and made me feel completely ignored by him.

I have previously used Perry Ford National City for service and was previously offered a 10% military discount, what happened, i asked the cashier and he totally (again) ignored my question.<//review>

RENATO!!!!!! Thank you so much for helping us out in a pinch! Thursday morning I got into my vehicle and was greeted with a “Service AdvanceTrac” notice on my dashboard. After googling what this could mean, I realized the severity of getting this addressed. My wife called Perry Ford on Mile of Cars and spoke with Renato. Despite having an appointment, he told us to bring our car down and he’ll get it taken care of.

He did! Only downside, if I can say that, is that it took a day to get our car back, but I knew that might be the case as we did not have an appointment. I digress, we stayed in contact via text throughout the whole process and we had our car back Friday morning with the problem addressed and taken care of.

Thank you Renato! Thank you Armando! Thank you Perry Ford!</review>

<Text>Horrible experience. Never do what they say they will. Never get back to you in service! Contradict each other all the time. Even the service mangers word doesn’t count for anything. Only reason I give two stars is because some of the sales team and reception is very kind. But service and management are the worst. I’ve bought three cars from them and will definitely get my fourth from another Ford.<//Text><user_id>108936394339357587470</user_id></record>

I’ve been here a few times, and they’re always great. I went yesterday to get my oil change, and I chose a package that had quite a few add ons that my car did not quite need yet. Tony advised me to go with a different package that fit my needs better and saved me money! They even washed my car after the service. Amazing people!</review>

Maybe I’m spoiled from Mercedes but it was a horrible experience my car had oily handprints on the door it has handprints on the fender walls and had dirty handprints on the hood.  I was told that there was an inspection done, like the 91 point expansion and obviously what’s not included in the inspection is your coolant level because my coolant was below the low level I mean I couldn’t see where the cool was I had to add some myself. And now it makes me wonder if there was any inspection done on my vehicle other than the tire depth so now I’m going to go through and check all the other levels  I understand car washes don’t come standard with every dealership Mercedes always washes my car while I take it in for an oil change obviously ford doesn’t<//Text>

My experience at Perry Ford was amazing! The salesmen that we worked with, Curt and Louie, handled the sale very well and professionally. They clearly wanted to sell a vehicle, but they did not push too far or over-sell. They worked with us to get us within our budget and to recommend a vehicle that fit our goal. I highly recommend Perry Ford National City.< /Text>

Perry Ford has always been my go to dealer for a new vehicle. I have made 5 vehicle purchases with them but my most recent purchase, they went above and beyond. I had been involved in an accident and my car was totaled. They picked me up and I was out of the lot with a new car in less than 2 hours. They got me great financing and peace of mind. Andy you are wonderful!<//Text>

<Review>Perry's Ford service maintenance on my car.
When I first bought my Ford Focus, I bought a Maintenance service package, that comes with a car wash. It has been twice I taken my car for service, this technician is very careless.  First time took my car for maintenance service, I noticed my car's carpet was  peeled off from the door frame,  greasy doors, no car washed. This 2nd time I told the service adviser to make sure my car gets washed, Nope it  wasn't washed, and again the car has big spots of grease all over. I called  Patrick, the service adviser, explained everything,
he told me to bring my car on Tuesday, (this was Friday) 25 miles? Nope didn't do it. Not coming back to this dealership. I used to like this Place when Anthony, an older man was a service adviser.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>2nd servicing on 5/19. As per usual, excellent customer service! Other dealerships should take training lessons from Perry Ford on how to provide proper customer service!

Took vehicle in for servicing. They were extremely busy and I did have an appt. Patrick was courteous, great communication, and they had my vehicle done before I expected them to. The only thing I was disappointed is, I thought they’d run the car through the wash like other dealerships before returning. Other than than that, very satisfied.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>I had a really great experience at Perry Ford. Andy was my salesperson and he was very accommodating. They didn’t have the car that I was looking for so he found one for me in LA and had it delivered to the dealership next day. The entire process was very easy and I would definitely recommend that you ask for Andy when buying a new car!</Text>< username>

We had a great experience! If we could give them 10 stars we would! We went in with no expectations. My husband and I were looking to trade in our 2011 Mustang GT for a brand new one. Everyone went above and beyond to help us get financing so my husband could leave with the car he wanted and not have to settle for anything less. From the moment we walked in we hade numerous sales persons asking us if we need help and not the overly pushy kind of help. lol Thank You Perry Ford you made my husbands birthday a little extra special this year!<//text>

Very disappointing with the service of this dealership. At the time of purchase, I was lied to and added services were included on my purchase when told they were free due to a coupon at the time. The dealership has been very negligent in canceling these added services. I have talked to the bank and their financing department and all have indicated this services can  be withdrawn, but  the sales person at this dealership was very rude, yelled at me over the phone that I could not cancel this service and hung up the phone. Not a very professional attitude for someone that purchase a very expensive vehicle. My company is ready to purchase other work trucks, but after this type of service, I will never visit this dealership again. Beware future buyers, if you purchase any vehicles from this dealership, review your contracts  thoroughly and if you are told you are getting free add on-s, make sure you verify them on the sales contract.< /review>

Best experience ever !!!! Juan De La Torre was great on communicating the time my car will be ready. I was due any day and had a time line since I wasn’t sure when I was going to deliver and have a baby at home. He Uber me home and Uber me back to receive my car.  I went on Monday and had baby today Tuesday. Thank you so much for the amazing experience and fitting me in</Review>

He is knowledgeable and friendly and has kept me informed about the repairs that need to  happen and other problems  the car had.   Definitely , An Employee of the month !  You have a great employee!

I felt and experienced the lack of experience from the service team. I took n my vehicle with same mechanical issue as last year and know that it is not under warranty it is suppose to be a very costly repair compared to only a sensor last year.</Review>

I was very pleased with my experience at Perry Ford in my purchase of my new Ford Ranger.  Eric Paulsen was honest, price of the vehicle didn't change and I received excellent customer service. Also the business manager who processed my paperwork and took my check sadly I can't recall his name was a pleasure to work with.  The whole process from test drive to completing the paperwork was less than 2 hours. Very efficient employees who know what they are doing. I thrive on not being pressured or not being told the truth. Highly recommend this dealership. Bought my beautiful truck Saturday morning Sept. 5th. Plus it's being delivered Tuesday morning Sept. 8th as that I had plans for the Labor Day weekend.<//review>

I purchased my 2017 Raptor from Perry Ford and was happy with the transaction at the time of purchase.  Recently I took the truck in for service of coolant leak and engine knock at start up. My service adviser, Renato did a great job keeping me informed and abreast of the work taking place on my truck.  Technician Jesus Rodriguez knocked it put of the park with the repairs.  All work done fell under warranty and the truck is running as good as new if not better.  I received poor service at two other dealerships and I am happy to say I found Perry Ford was not the third.  I will be back to Perry Ford for service again and will return when its time for a new truck.  Thank you for a job well done.</Text>

Perry Ford provides excellent service, on time and at a very reasonable price.  As a repeat customer, I have always found the repair or service that I needed was completed right the first time and on time.

Always great communication and solid advice from Renato, Perry Ford Service Advisor, before and during service.  Perry Ford in National City is highly recommended and a trusted source for any service or repair needed.</review>

<Review>I always have such a great experience with Perry Ford. They are very professional and friendly. They always go above and beyond to take care of my car. I had to drop my car off before they opened and they went out to where I left my car parked and picked it up for my appointment time. I don't know many places that would do that for their customers.<//Review>< pics>

<text>This service department is absolutely horrible. My fuel filter cap was stripped so I need a new one. They tried charging me $80 for a new cap (they are only $25 new) and then tried charging me $235 just to remove the stripped cap and put the new one on. If you need your truck serviced only go here if you have no other options< /text>< Pictures>

<review>The salesman, Erik, was a pleasure to interact with and he really helped to get me a great deal. He was attentive, professional and never made me feel pressured to do anything. My one suggestion, is always let the customer know, but most importantly, ask for permission before running ones credit.< /review>< time>

Shopping for a used Jeep, we found one we liked in Perry Ford's inventory. It  had been traded in but not cleaned up and made ready for sale, so we gave them a week to spruce it up and call us back. The service and sales teams were diligent and contacted us quickly to let us know that they couldn't sell us that Jeep in good conscience. The mechanics had discovered a rats nest in the engine compartment, and rather than fix it quickly and sell it to us, they politely apologized.< /text>

I had an amazing experience buying a new car. Never have I been able to say it was a smooth, no pressure process until today.  Brando was knowledgeable, and he took the time to explain the whys and hows of every detail without being pushy. Anik was fabulous as well walking me through all the financial aspects. Highly recommend!<//Review>

I loved how Andy May listened to my needs. Andy was very pleasant to talk to and Andy made me feel comfortable, no pressure, and was transparent in my purchase. Andy helped me when my wife had to leave to take my daughter to an appointment and I forgot my phone in the car she took. Andy lent me his phone until my wife came back to sign paperwork. Andy also informed me with an app that lets me start, unlock, lock and let’s me see where my truck is and it’s time due for maintenance. Andy impressed very much and I lease my vehicles every three years BEST EXPERIENCE I EVERY HAD IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THATS A lOT OF CARS— 2 cars every three years. I will definitely say if you are looking for service, look for ANDY MAY AT PERRY FORD IN NATIONAL CITY !! Thank you Andy May & Perry Ford!!!<//review>

Renato is one of the top notch Service Advisors at Perry Ford of National City. He is my personal best and favorite advisors I have had the pleasure to conduct business with, since owning 4 Ford vehicles in the last 23 years and still own 2 of them. Renato will keep you updated through the duration of any services on your vehicle and will give you a realistic timeline when vehicle repairs will be complete.  Thank you all for the quick A/C repairs on my Mustang and putting her back on the road. Well done Perry Ford!  And thanks again Renato!</Review>

<Text>I took my vehicle into the Perry Ford Service Center in National City reference a rattling noise that I heard when driving. The problem was diagnosed and the repair was completed. The technician suggested a diagnostic of the ABS system be performed and i approved it at 2:30 pm that day. I did not hear back from the service representative (Patrick) until close to 4pm and I had to initiate the contact.

Patrick told me that my vehicle would need to be kept in the shop until Monday so the technician can complete the diagnosis. Again, I had to contact Patrick to get an update (which was not much of an update) saying the vehicle was still being worked on. This was around 10 am on Monday.

Patrick said there were no loaner vehicles to give me and he had no estimate of when the diagnostic would be complete. Patrick then tried to offer me a rental car for a discounted rate. I thought to myself “this kid must be joking” I’m already going to be footing a hefty bill for the repairs and a multibillion dollar company won’t even give me a loaner vehicle. This is ridiculous!!!!!

I still have not heard back from Patrick and Ford still has my vehicle.

I finally heard back from Patrick and he told me the problem was the ABS control module which would cost roughly $2100. This would mean for the total cost of repairs I would be paying $2300. I have no problem paying for the work that needs to be done. My issue is the customer service portion of this transaction, or lack their of.

The dealership finally broke down and gave me a loaner at no charge after I told Patrick I would not authorize any repairs until he spoke with a manager about getting me a loaner vehicle. It shouldn’t have to come to this. This is why people hate going to car dealerships. Their is a lack of trust/good customer service.

I have been a Ford customer for the majority of my life and this was the straw that broke the camels back.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<time>1594317346395</time><name>Bryan Davidson< /name><text>I first showed up on a Friday morning, with a scheduled appointment. I explained the issues I was having and that I would be waiting in their waiting room for an outcome, before leaving. I was told it would be an “hour or so” and I would be called.

After an hour and a half, I went to check on the status. I was told they were unsure of the cause of the issues and it could be overnight before it was rectified. I asked to talk to the technician, who was on lunch. When asked why I wasn’t notified, I was told, “someone dropped off a car before you, and they had to fix that one first.” I ask rhetorically, what’s the reason for an appointment? Also, it is worth mentioning, the next day was a holiday and the next day a Sunday. So now overnight meant 3 days.

I then asked for a courtesy car to use in the meantime. I was told I could rent one from Enterprise and that Ford would set me up with the discounted rate. I begrudgingly agreed. I was told that enterprise was “just a block away” and I should walk. Turned out to be closer to a mile. Next, I showed up at Enterprise and was told there was no reservation under my name. And that it would be 45 minutes before the rental is ready. Why this couldn’t have been done in the 20 minute walk is beyond me.

Finally, now 4 days later, when I was told it would take a day or so at most and cost $200. The repair cost almost $700. To say I am upset and frustrated is an understatement. I am an under promise and over deliver person. This experience spurs the taste of Ford as a whole and will make me question my next car purchase, which is really close given the 100k miles on my car. Sad, because this is my 5th Ford vehicle.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>I cannot believe that in this day and age there are still dishonest, shady, car salesmen. Took my daughter to purchase her first vehicle at this dealership. We were given an itemized cost breakdown for the vehicle; which we took to our bank. The bank then called Perry Ford for a TOTAL price on this vehicle. We took the check from the bank to Perry Ford and were directed to the financial officer. My daughter signed the multitude of papers handed to her. After signing them, before I could stop her, they said she owed $400.00 which she handed over in cash she had received for her birthday. They lied to us, they lied to the bank! They would not return the money my daughter naively handed to them. It is outrageous to believe car dealerships are still practicing this kind of dishonesty. We also discovered a crack in the windshield which was in an inconspicuous location not readily visible. DO N!OT BE DECEIVED BY THIS DEALERSHIP! Women beware.</Review>< gmapID>

I had a 8:30am appointment, I was told my car would be ready by 2-3pm...they called me at 4pm to tell me they broke something and they had to order the part and wait until the next day. I had a very important 5pm appointment that day, had to miss it. I was called when my car was ready the next day, I was offered a Lyft service so I could pick up my car, I waited about 2 hrs and nothing. I ended up getting myself an Uber. So I spent extra $40 (both ways).
I get there, take care of the bill and waited another 30-40 minutes for someone to bring the car to me. They used to wash the exterior of my car everytime I took it in for any service, they don't do this anymore. I asked about the battery of my key to be replaced and they sent me to the shop inside. The guy at the shop sends me back to thw service guys so they could open the key.  At this point I just got on my car and left.</Text>

From the time we stepped onto the lot until I picked up my car (two days later) the service was excellent. I went to another dealership right down the street and we couldn't make a deal. Julio and Brandon made the deal happen and I got the car I wanted. I also was able to order a part for my wives car and it came in before the expected delivery so I was able to pick it up at the same time as my car saving me another trip. I highly recommend Perry Ford for your next car purchase.</text>

I have been coming to Perry Ford of National City since, I got my Ford Mustang and I really like the fact that everyone that works at this service department does not try and sell you many things for your vehicle that you probably do not need just to get you to pay more. They recommend many things on my vehicle just to pay attention to but, do not pressure to get it done just letting me know. All, of the people that work at this dealership are straight to the point to get your vehicle serviced in an appropriate timely manner especially during COVID-19; still right now are still efficient.< /Review>

I had a really good experience. They worked with me on getting the best offer for me. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I would totally recommend this dealership. I left happy with my new truck 🤗.<//Review>

Just purchased a new 2020 Explorer and Eric my Sales Manager was amazing. It was Memorial Day and it was so busy but Eric did not let it get to him. He  explained features about the car and made sure all of our questions were answered. He worked with us to get us the numbers we needed and I would highly recommend this dealer again. Thank you Eric and Diego! The Manager on duty was on it . Didn’t catch his name but he was on the floor making things happen with a positive attitude.< /Text>

Hi, my experience with Perry Ford has always been great! I can't complain they make it so easy to make an appt online, drop off my car for service and then they call when your car is ready to be picked up. Can't get easier than that and the customer service is excellent! Thank You Perry Ford, one Happy Customer!< /Text>

No customer services and would not recommend coming here for service or purchase. Just moved to CA and trying to find a place to bring my vehicle in and was so disrespectful. On top of it being a female, they have no RESPECT!< /review>

Was my first time visiting this location and I was happy I did. Juan De Lza Torre took excellent care and was detailed oriented. Kept me informed of all the issues my car needed and was very helpful.  I will be returning and since I have other ford vehicles I will bring them for future repeat business.  Thank you again Juan!<//Review>

Renato took very good care of me. I had planned to be there for a while so I brought plenty reading material. Before I could really settle into reading, he came to let me know if the items that will need service soon and all that was good. He told me my car would be ready soon. I was ready to go within the hour. The service and timing were great, even though they were really busy. That's exactly why I continue to get my car serviced here.

Eric Paulsen was our salesperson, he was great. It was  our 2nd time buying at your dealership, would do it again. The only negative was there was 500ish miles on the truck, which we were not informed of.< /Text>

I usually give 5 stars since I started going there for my car maintenance. This time 1star because my paper works says fluids inspected  and Marked okay/green, but when I got home open my car hood the coolant fluid level is at below minimum.  I don’t think they did a proper inspection and at least they could have let me know that coolant needs refill and tell how much< /text>

<text>Good morning. Where do I begin... During this time of uncertainty where this pandemic has affected each one us in more than one way,  such as death in family, reduced wages, loss of job, and many other factors.  I myself have experienced one or more of these. As I expressed to you my situation and how I was not able to afford the cost of the repairs, you took it upon yourself to reach out to your SERVICE MANAGER  and see what could be done to help out.

It brings tears to my eyes and warms my heart thats there are still good people in the world.. I  am truly humbled by this experience. Words cannot express how thankful and grateful to you and the service team in helping to repair my Explorer and going that mile to ensure what needed to be done was taken care.

Thank you.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Go to another dealership, if you want to save your time and want quality repair.
Unfortunately, this Ford Dealership has by far given the worst customer service, and repair. We own two companies and service our ford company trucks often. We will no longer come to this dealership.<//review>

< Review>
Had my car for over 40 days. Battery ran dead since it sat for so long, and they tried to charge me for a new battery! Had to speak to manager, who made it right and comp’d the battery.

As far as the initial issue; I drive an electric car, and my EV battery died. Ford decided to replace with a refurbished EV battery instead of just putting in a new one, per warranty! On top of that, they made sure that the refurbished battery had as much wear and tear as my old one. God forbid they give me a “better” battery. Very disappointed in Ford, and will never buy Ford again<//Review>

I very much enjoyed my experience at Perry Ford. Andy May and the team bent over backwards to get me a car as mine had been stolen and my son needed trans fior a new job he is starting this week! Andy's compassion and sense of humor reassured both my son and myself that there was a car waiting just for us! Even if it was orange, which I described it as Shimmering Pumpkin. Regardless of it's  unusual color, it's a fantastic car to drive and will never get lost in a Wal Mart parking lot!!!<//Review>

Eric Paulsen made it happen from the customer engagement to making numbers work and then being able to close the sale! My husband and I are very happy with his new car and will definitely be sending other interested friends and family his way. Thank you for going above and beyond as well as answering all questions. Very excited to be driving a 2020 hybrid that’s going to be saving us so much gas! See you soon! Perry Ford NC fans< /review>

Was an easy experience buying online. Much better than sitting in a dealership for hours. I did not understand however why the needed a front and back picture of my husbands social security card after everything was approved and we had signed the contract. Still trying to get an answer from our salesperson but no luck.</review>

<review>Outstanding service provided by Xavier. Brought the Ford Fiesta in for door problem (front passenger door) does not lock. He called the manufacturer if the problem was covered on recall, unfortunately, no. Also had rattling noise on the steering column, and it only needed some tightening somewhere in the steering column to fix. All is good now. Thanks Xavier, keep up the good work.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Good quality work. Had my fuel pump replaced bu goodyear after a year it started to act funny, mainly only showing 3/4 tank while being full.  Took it to Perry Ford and after they checked it out it was found that they installed the wrong part.

Let me start by saying I used to get my service done at Fuller Ford of Chula Vista.  They changed owners to Penske and things went down hill; I haven’t gotten service done at a dealership since.  They then changed owners again, and now it’s Chula Vista Ford, but regaining my trust may take awhile and haven’t gone in.

I’ve never gotten service here before, and was pleasantly surprised how great the experience was.  Everyone was nice and friendly, and eager to help.

I was getting my oil changed at a drive tru lube shop, while it was fast they didn’t do a multipoint inspection, and just seemed lacking.

Not only did I get great service, they also did a transmission recall and updated the firmware.  The entire process took about 2.5hrs, which included a complimentary wash.  Not the fastest, but completely acceptable.  They gave me great service recommendations and will be pricing a brake job soon.

Perry Ford is now my go to dealership.  I will be getting all my parts and service here now on.

Thank you< /review>

Renato and his staff go above and beyond to make appointments go smooth with strong communication skills and frequent updates on vehicle appointments. Definitely appreciate their customer service! They definitely make you feel like you are part of the Ford Mile of Cars Family. Definitely going to miss their service as I am moving out of California! I definitely appreciate their professionalism and quick response to services!<//Text>

Despite showing up 20 minutes early for my appointment, Renato was pleasant and accommodating. I go here for regular scheduled maintenance and it's always seamless.

The coffee machine didn't work so that was a bit of a bummer but overall it was fine. Thank you!<//review>

I had a bad experience here at the dealership. I had an appointment on Thursday 8/20 at 1pm. Even received emails reminding me. I took time off work and had to rearrange for transportation home. I get there and Xavier says that I don’t have an appointment and that they have too many cars to work on. He told me to bring it back on Monday. Monday comes around and I take it in and they said I don’t have an appointment. I was fuming AGAIN I left work early to get car service and AGAIN arranged transportation to pick me up. I had to search for my email to show proof because they thought I was lying. Left the car. Came back on Wednesday and Xavier couldn’t not find my paperwork. Never once received an apology for the inconvenience. Worst service ever.</review>

<Review>I had a great car buying experience at Perry Ford in National City. Everyone I dealt with was helpful, courteous and professional. No car lot games. They had the car I wanted. They were straight forward with price on my new Shelby GT500, what they offered for my trade in and the financing. Most dealers are trying to get tens of thousands of dollars over MSRP. We settled on a reasonable price on the car. I’m very happy with the deal we made. Go see them. They will treat you well.<//Review>< Pics>

My whole experience was awesome. From Luis answering my texts from home and putting his hands on the car I found online. To Colette in finance. This is my 4th car purchased at this location. And the most pleasant purchase of any new car I've every purchased, including Hyundai and Toyota. Will buy here again.<//Review>

<Review>We had a very bad flat tire on the 15-freeway on our way from Corona to San Diego. I called your dealership so I can have the original tire replacement and have the sensor fixed (on the dashboard was tire pressure low even though we have installed the reserved tire). I spoke to Juan at your service department and I felt very comfortable right away at the accommodating and honest sound of his voice. He gave me the cost for a new tire and calmly assure me that they can do the job. When we came and met Juan the following day, my comfort and trust level even went higher. Juan was very friendly and very professional in his demeanor. He assured me that the work will be quick and excellent. He also offered me and my wife the ride back and forth to our hotel. Juan is an outstanding representative for your Ford Dealership. Your other employees inside the service office department were all very friendly as well. Thank you!!!!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>I'd like to thank Renato my service write up technician. he was most professional and had my truck worked on promptly.  I was in and out in no time.  However at the lounge trying to get some water for my wife was a real headache got tossed around back and forth for a cup of water.  I think they should at least have bottled water for their customers instead of hiding the cups because of covid 19.</review>< pics>

Renato and the Service Technicians, Service Desk and Home Shuttle Team are OUTSTANDING!!  Renato has taken care of my F-150 since I purchased at Perry - and would not go anywhere else for service.

He listens to the customer and ensures the Perry Team is catalyzed to the finest service to the customer!< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Renato was very helpful through the whole service process. I showed up at Perry Ford with an urgent issue and no appointment. Renato helped me out within minutes even though they were busy. The service took a couple of days and I was able to easily send messages to Renato with questions or to ask for status updates. Renato also provided important documentation and verbal instructions to ensure the optimal "teaching" and  performance of my new clutch and transmission control module. I won't hesitate to go back to Perry Ford to fix any major issues with my Ford Focus.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Even the “dreaded “ paperwork process was speedy and cordial with a friendly processor.</Review></record>

Amazingly, each key player in their Sales Department that worked with me, Raj, Kurt, and Alex, were amenable and courteous throughout. I don’t know how they do it... But they made things happen smoothly and effectively.

Bought my first Ford car here, and absolutely love it. Recently had to go fix the 2018 Explorer here, and Mr. Renato at the Service Department was  attentive and he helped me get a ride back home during the repair. Awesome place to buy a car and after service for your car. I appreciate Perry Ford, and thank you!</Text>

JDLT advised us in a timely manner that the car needed a bit more work and we were still out the door on our way home before mid day.

When I got there I met Kurt and he worked with me and told me what I needed and then he assured me that I was going to get a vehicle and that it might not be that vehicle but it could be another one. It really affected him that I couldn’t walk away with my car on that day… Which I thought was sweet. So in a couple days I had everything I needed ... like I had to update my license and get a down payment.

I texted him and told him I was going to go by his office and when I got there he was very attentive ... always gave Me coffee, which I needed… we went through the paperwork and asked me for paperwork that they needed for the application… Then I met another employee that was a new and he went through the series of documentation that he needed in order to finish the contract… It was helpful… he explained everything that I signed.

Then I went in another office of the employee that was supposed to take do the paperwork  but was busy with someone else… He printed out the contract ... I gave him the AAA insurance policy for confirmation that I did have insurance… submitted the $1600 for the down payment… And then Kurt took me to retrieve my car and congratulated me ... all of them did.

I would of mentioned the names of the other two gentlemen except I didn’t get a business card from them. All three of them were very attentive, personable, was happy I was getting what I wanted, complimented me on my patience and made this an extraordinary transaction!

One question I’m sure you wanna know… Will I ever purchased another vehicle to Perry Ford Of National City? The answer… Absolutely! Will I share my experience to others? The answer is… Absolutely!

Thank you from the bottom of my heart… Without you and your professionalism… I wouldn’t be driving my brand new car!< /review>

After a bit of negotiation we got a great deal on our Ford F150! Worked with Grace and Marvin in sales. They were awesome! They treated us with respect and courtesy through the whole sales process and made sure we got what we wanted.<//Review>

First time using Perry Ford since moving from out of state, and Patrick was the one who assisted me yesterday. Told him about some tire issues I was having and he assured they would also take a look at them. Very kind staff all around. Was a longer wait than I thought, but for a Saturday not horrible since most people take their cars on the weekend. Overall will definitely be going back again.<//text>

< Review>
The service was so great, what the porters did to get us our truck was beyond what they needed to do. It was in the far back corner of the back lot and they had to move at least 6-10 vehicles to get it to us. We were so impressed and it was 10pm on the Sunday of the Memorial Day weekend.  They deserve the biggest thank you from us. Daniel was fantastic too. Accommodating Ron as he had to walk the lots again to make sure which truck we were talking about.  Perry Ford has totally earned our loyalty and we will be back and will be sharing this experience with all our friends. Thank you again so much we are so happy with our purchase.< /Review>

The amenities in the lobby are very welcoming, it's a calm place to wait while your friend shops for a car. Although the Starbucks machine didnt have working hot chocolate, the country candy machine was a nice addition as well the TV.< /review>

I found my Ford dealership!  I usually find dealing with car repairs frustrating with other places pushing things to fix.  Juan at Perry Ford was very friendly and helpful.  He explained everything that NEEDED to be done and was never pushy about things I wanted to hold off on for this visit.  Juan worked with Jesus to get my car fixed & safe for me to drive my kiddos around again.  I am very grateful to them both.  I definitely recommend Perry Ford service department.<//Text>

I was traveling through San Diego and had a “ check engine” light come on. I googled it for my car and decided to have it looked at. I looked for local dealers, chose Perry because of close proximity to Coronado. What a great choice it was. I showed up early for my appointment and was warmly greeted and car looked at immediately. The diagnosis was a “clean air” component. It was fixed and at no charge even on my 2007 car!   Perry ford just wanted to do the right thing. Exceptional service!  Can’t thank them enough!<//text>

Carlos was so awesome! We went to LOOK at cars and ended up leaving with one. He didn’t pressure us, which we liked. He worked us a great deal, which we appreciated. And offered to get us food during the process, which we turned down.
Everyone was friendly and straight to the point. Car buying is not your typical experience at Perry Ford.
We plan on returning for our next Ford car buying experience.<//review>

What can I say. Pretty simple. Went in for an oil change, fluids topped off and tire rotation. Got what I expected on a timely manner.

I do wish it came with a car wash.... that would be epic. Be the cherry on top.</Text>

Dropping off my car was super easy and quick. The service took about 2 hours. I picked it up at lunch. Was not at the dealer longer than 10 mins, for both events. Was greeted warmly as well. Absolutely no complaints.</review>

Brando was great! Took time to listen and patience to help find the right truck. So excited for my new F-150. Found everything I wanted and more. Staff was not pushy but more focused on my needs. Highly recommended for Perry Ford!<//Text>

Patrick and the service crew at Perry Ford National City were awesome in answering any questions and concerns I had. I went in for a recall and it was brought to my attention the car needed more work done to it, Patrick set everything up and took care of it and even got new wipers installed. I left feeling safe and secured in knowing the car got all the errors fixed.  Thank you guys I appreciate the help and attentiveness!<//text>

I got a great deal on my ford focus here. But why does it take so long to fill out paperwork or get a credit line to receive it? Love my car and they took great care of me and even after checked in on me and helped with maintenance.< /Review>

Horrible experience, waited in the lobby for nearly 3 hours. When i got there the person who was helping me told me that the person who was going to help me was on break and when he would be back he would do the paperwork. I was very disappointed when I ask how much longer for just a simple oil change and the front desk lady had no idea of my car because nobody had put it in the system. So i see my car just waiting there and i was very disappointed that no one had questioned why my vehicle was just standing there for 3 hours. Horribly organization and I left there without and oil change and time wasted.<//text>

<Review>The people at Perry Ford were professionals from the time we walked on the lot.  Rafael brought us to the Trucks on the roof, He and Omar took acre of us, answering all of our questions. We found the exact Ford Ranger we were looking for. We sat down to look at numbers and our trade in, they offered a great price for the trade in and a great price on the Ranger.  The manager was very nice,  offering to "throw in" some great perks to sweeten the deal. The finance guy took good care of us, signing a pile of paperwork to purchase our new Ford Ranger!   I will gladly go back to Perry Ford in the future!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Renato is amazing. His smile is contagious at7:45 in the morning. He is quick, knowledgeable, professional, courteous and kind. He arranged a ride with a Lyft driver for me to go home to wait for my car because the regular shuttle driver called in sick. When the my car was ready, Renato provided a shuttle ride back to Perry Ford which replaced a defective air bag for my safety. I would gladly recommend Perry Ford in National City's Mile of Cars to anyone with a Ford. Thank you  Renato. And thank you Perry Ford. Renato should receive a raise for being the perfect employee.<//review>

This was my first visit to Perry Ford. My new service advisor (Renato Segura) was a joy to work with. After reviewing my invoice I discovered that Alfredo Ibarra (formerly with Witt Lincoln) had serviced the truck. I have been trusting Alfredo with serving my vehicles for more than 10 years.

On December 18th I had an appointment for an oil change and Multipoint Inspection. This was my second visit and it was based on the recommended service after my first visit on June 23rd. I was assigned a new service advisor (Xavier Servin). Xavier went out of his way in providing outstanding service. His efforts are greatly appreciated.<//text>

I have had issues with this dealership atleast 3 times. I didnt think id ever comeback if it wasnt for the costco peogram. Costco brought be to this dealer once again and I was willing to give them one more chance. I do not like negative reviews unless they are constructive.

I was attended by Marvin Morales and he was very irritable and rude and refused to show me the invoice of the car I wanted to purchase. He wanted me to just take his word for it. He trying to sell me a car at full MSRP completely ignoring the costco price.

Its not the first time I used the Costco Auto program. The first thing they do is show you the invoice price when you sit down with them. When I told him the quote I had from another dealer he simply said that I should have bought the car from the other dealer then. At that point I was not going to make him more mad than he already was. Maybe he was having a bad day but in this economy you shouldnt turn away a potential buyer.

Remember you have the power as the consumer and you can walk away. Also, remember to speak up and contact costco if this happens to you. If you don't, the dealership will keep track of who spoke with you last and you will keep that saleaman as if they own you!

I am begging costco to pair me with another salesman because I believe one individual does not represent the whole company. If my next trip to the dealership is different I will update this review happily because its only fair.< /Text>

Was able to get the exact car I wanted! A week later... Still waiting for a car that was supposed to be in transit. My trade in, I was told would not be put up for sale until I received my new car, is listed for sale online. My down payment has been deposited in their account even though I was told this would happen once we updated the paper work and I took ownership of my new car. Really frustrated. I don't trust Perry Ford.<//review>

<text>Vehicle was put in to do camera system and fix paint that was rusting. Had the vehicle there for three weeks and the camera system was not repaired when trying to contact service person apparently he left the company.  The work on the camera was no where on the ticket but they claimed it was done. Now they said he could provide supporting documentation.  Camera is the same as when I brought it in and the battery was disconnected which I understand it is a tactic that is used  to reset them.  I know because the clock was off by hours.  Very disappointed first because someone left and they don't have procedures to ensure the work is completed and secondly because I feel I can't trust them.  This was warranty work for a 2018 Ford Explorer< /text>< Pics>

Perry got me in and out swiftly as always...being sensitive to my time.  They also found an oil leak which they repaired under warranty and a nail in a tire which they also repaired.  They are always VERY thorough and do outstanding work!!!</text>

This is a LONG overdue review I bought my first car here 2 years ago. I went in asking to buy a never before owned new car,  the person helping me was I believe Marvin? When I was looking at cars I kept telling him what I was looking for but he kept pointing me in another direction. I felt rushed and forced to make a choice so I went with his recommendation. My dad asked him a few times so this a new car right not pre owned and he said yes new car the miles on it (700+ miles) are from test drives.  Moving forward to paper signing, they took my $5,000 down payment had me start signing papers which the process took hours. I was there till after business hours. Basically once they took down payment and had me start signing I was informed that that car in deed had been  previously owned for a few weeks. I was so disappointed and angry. I'd like to say I didn't go though with it BUT come on I was a naive young lady buying her 1st car. Fast forward to my first viechle service appointment they tell me the service isn't covered therefore I have to pay out of pocket yet when I first bought the car I was told it was covered and I wouldn't have to pay out of pocket since it was a "new" viechle. Anyway when I asked why it wasnt covered they said it was because my viechle was a used car. Also had my windows tinted through the dealership and there was a lot of air bubbles left on there when I called to gave them fix it they had me take it back in just to tell me that's the best it will get. MARVIN talked me onto getting tinted through them because it was "professional factory tint". My windows may not look horrible from a distance but up close you can see all the air bubbles. Worst experience ever. I would not recommend this location to anyone, I will definitely never buy here again.< /Review>

I have to say that from the start we were treated with a lot of professionalism and knowledge," Patrick Mikita" takes all ten stars!!
my car had a crankshaft problem and was dropped off on
friday june 12th @ 8am I mentioned to Patrick if he could also
do an in depth check on the car or if  I had to make a separate
appt, he very nicely said.... I can do an add on, no problem, don't
worry, I will take care of that for you, I was so appreciative to Patrick
he was always there for any questions and concerns.
The best part of my Perry Ford experience.........
When it came to my car, I only had to deal with one person, at all
times, (Patrick)
he was very thorough on the work done on my vehicle, I have to say, this has been the best car service experience EVER with any of my cars.
You're the best Patrick, Thank You!!!
Enjoy all your stars and hope you get a bonus, well deserved!!!!</Review>

Got an amazing deal on an amazing truck.  Well under MSRP, so much that I almost felt guilty.  The entire staff was very courteous, friendly, and helpful.  Never thought buying a new truck could be so life changing!  Nadar was not just a sales guy, but an genuine soul who helped me see life differently.  Truly blessed to have met him, and I won't forget him.</Text>

We were promised a good car with nothing to worry about but the car pulls hard to the left when driven. A purchase of nearly $10,000 warrants a happy purchase without the above mentioned issues.

For the most part, everything went fine. Patrick was very courteous and helpful. There were a few little things that I did not like. When I went to pick up my car, I waited for about 30 minutes after I had been told they were bringing my car out. And when they finally brought the car out, they had not washed it as they always do.<//review>

Came to get my oil changed. I made an appointment. When I showed up, I was immediately greeted and taken care of by the staff.
While they worked on my car, I was seated in a lounge with free coffee, the news playing on the TV, and various vending machines.
They were quicker than I thought and even fixed a bulb that had come loose at no charge.
Everyone was so polite and cheerful. I will definitely come back for all my oil changes.< /review>

This is my second lease with Perry Ford National City. It’s been 3 years since seeing them and somehow they still remembered me ... that’s the nice family vibe you get! I traded my explorer in for a new nice sparking one and they made it happen... which I know it was hard and really appreciate all they did to make it happen.  Thank you Kam, Jody, and Jesus I will see you in 3 years again! BTW I also get all my service done at their shop and have had good experience.< /Review>

I’m satisfied with the service I received for my 2015 Ford C Max. They took the time and effort to fix the problem. They are pro active in letting me know when it will be available for pick and at the same time, gave me a loaner vehicle to use while my car is being fix. I would definitely recommend this dealership for a job well done..</review>

They are knowledgeable, thorough, efficient, kind and interested in making the best transaction for the customer. The management & staff are the best. When buying or leasing ur next vehicle consider Perry Ford, Chrysler, dodge, Ram.

Jesus Alvarado and Daniel Rodriguez assisted me with purchasing a new 4x4 F-150. Both Jesus and Daniel did an excellent job helping me find a truck that met the criteria for what I was looking for, while staying within the price range I wanted to be within. Jesus and Daniel both stayed with me late, after business hours to make sure I had time to look at trucks. At no time did either Jesus or Daniel make me feel rushed or pressured to buy a truck. If you are looking for a new Ford or used car give Jesus or Daniel a call, as I highly recommend both of them.< /Review>

I scheduled an appointment online on 05/15/2020 for a service to be done on 05/25/2020 @ 8:00am. I received a reminder about the appointment via email on 05/23/2020. I then received a text reminder the following day, 05/24/2020. On 05/25/2020 I show up at 8:00am and they are closed. I wait for about 15 minutes before deciding to leave. I call the dealership later that day to find out that the service department is closed. I received a weak excuse that they have no control over the system and didn’t provide any solutions. The kicker at the end was that I received an email on 05/27/2020 that I missed my appointment.< /review>

Overall the experien was good, since Perry Ford was able to take care of my car's repair, and handling it through my extended warranty. If I could improve one thing, it would be the communication between the Service team and customer. Unfortunately I had to contact them everytime, even though I was told I would be contacted by a certain time and day.

Thank you.</Text>

Not sure if they post fake reviews, but this dealership has the worst service dept. I waited for 15 min on the phone the first time only to have the call disconnected by the representative. I then waited 22 min the second day, only to be put on hold for additional 15 min. I was then informed after all the hold they do not have any appointments till end of March or 1st week of April. Finally, after requesting a date, they're system goes down and then they disconnect the call again. Not sure if they even care for your business.</review>

<review>I'd give it a 3 star due to the fact that when i had my oil change done the oil cap wasnt replaced properly. Also, the plastic covers for the seats and the paper for the floor was left for me to be disposed of. The people are nice and have very good customer service.<//review>< date>

Although the customer service was good, I am extremely unhappy that I have already had several issues with my 2020 Explorer that does not even have 4,000 miles on it yet. Also, when a rental car is offered (especially for people who drive SUVs and have multiple children and carseats)- you should inform customers that the rental company you send them to will ONLY allow them to take a Ford vehicle. I drive an explorer (& have 3 children who are all in carseats) and they tried to give me a tiny little Fiesta because that was “all they had that was a Ford- and Ford will only pay for this if you rent a Ford vehicle”. They had several other vehicles that fit my needs and were the same size as my Explorer, but they would not allow me to take them because they were not Fords. Had I known this- I would have called Enterprise ahead of time to make sure they had a vehicle that actually fit my needs, or not even gotten a rental at all.<//Text>

<Text>Left message about recall.  Never got a call back.   My Escape has a cracked engine block and I asked the guy if it's common.   He lied.  I've read on line from  various sources that a recall should be made on 2013 and 2014's due to a poor engine block design to achieve the Eco Boost.   The guy basically hung up on me.  I smell liars here and my friend works for a major corporation with fleet cars.   Said they stopped buying Escapes due to them being lemons.   Went over to Chevy's.< /Text><Date>1577734003249< /Date>< username>

Perry Ford National City is the only car service place that I honestly trust in South San Diego. From oil changes to recall checks, every single person there is personable and helpful. Shout out to Germain for being really helpful with my recall and with my oil change. He was very communicative with the progress of my car and assured me that if any issues were to come up, I was free to come back. Will definitely recommend anyone to this dealership</text>

I brought my F150 for service and Juan was very helpful and personable.  He said me truck will be done within 1.5 and he was right because it was done about an hour. He explained what the service department did that included tire rotation, tire pressure, brake inspection, etc. My hat is off to Juan and the Perry Ford’s Service Team.< /Review>

<Review>Phenomenal experience at Perry Ford, highly recommend going there for great deals on quality vehicles. To avoid typical dealership invasive sales tactics. Make sure you seek Faisal for sales advice and information. The greatest customer service experience I’ve ever had, hands down.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
This was the best experience I've ever had at a dealership.  The sales rep Sam worked with me to get the truck I wanted for a great price.  It took a couple day witch was fine with me.  Sam did what he could considering I don't have the best credit score.  I'll definitely be going back for my next vehicle. Also everyone I spoke to Perry Ford was helpful and friendly.<//Review>

< review>
In my opinion, taking  a vehicle to be service or  to anything going wrong with it, is always  frustrating due to the cost, however at Perry ford National city the staff is  so nice, always smiling, asking if we need anything. And about  service advisor Renato Segura, He is polite, always answering my questions, great knowledge, professional, but most of all,  service advisor Renato does something more important  that represents the core value of  servicing . However, sometimes these types of companies  forget the reason they exist, " us " the most important person "the Customer".
Great job Renato..you represent Perry Ford well,  I hope Perry Ford acknowledges you commitment  and rewards you. You are the type of employee all companies need and want to represent them well.<//review>

<Review>So my dad bought a car here, used. When my dad looked at it. It seemed good, clean no scratches but as soon as he arrived home we noticed some scratches. My thoughts are that they hid small or severe damages with hacks of paints or something because they took it to get washed from the dealer. It was just than when arriving home we noticed it. So just be careful in buying any car from here really look into it, use ur phone and don't depend on the dealer to tell you this and that also take a video or pictures.</Review>< Pics>

Great experience!!

We needed to buy a new car and something bigger as our family is expanding.  We did our home work and test drove many car brands and felt that Ford had the best value when comparing.  We were also dreading the whole sales part of the dealership experience, so we also delayed coming in for a very long time.  Once we did decide it was time, Carlos Bazán worked with us from the beginning as we came in a couple of times. Carlos was the absolute best, he helped us choose the car that we wanted. He was patient, not over bearing, helpful, explained everything clearly. He really made the whole experience a good a experience.  Once we decided our car , Andy the sales manager helped us and was awesome to work with as well. He gave gave us different payment scenarios, when we asked for break downs and explainations he couldn't of be any more clearer and transparent. My wife and I felt he had the best interest in helping us. Then we went to finance for the paper work, and worked with Alfredo, he was the nicest finance guy I've ever met, and patient because we had a lot of questions. And I also want to mention Marvin, another great person, very nice and helped us get are car clean and detailed ready for us, and walked us through and explained all the features of the car.
Over all, had a great experience, met great people. So I guess we will be buying again from Perry Ford!</Text>

Perry Ford has been great. I have a 2016 Ford Focus having recall issues and they have been great and helping me with my problem. Specifically Kim in the service Department has been wonderful. She is very knowledgeable and professional and very helpful.<//review>

However I had an issue with a recall part and had to bring it in for maintenance this last time and everything was replaced quickly. I worked with Victor who made sure everything was done quickly and easily. In all honesty if it wasn't for Victor and the maintenance crew who worked on my car, I would have never returned to this dealership. Again thanks to Victor and the people who helped good my car as I got my car back within 24 hours fixed.< /text><date>1548098150870</date></record>

< review>
Taking my cars to Renato in the Perry service drive is always a positive experience.

He's a true professional in every phase and is a straight up guy. He doesn't try to dance around issues or give you a smoke & mirror routine. With Renato you get just facts with no pressure. It is what it is, he gives me a price and I know that he always gives me the best value he can. Even with warranty work, he is very communicative and always lets me know the status of my cars & pro-actively informs me of when they'll be ready for pick up.

I strongly recommend  Renato for your Ford service needs.<//review>

I always enjoy taking my 2010 Ford Fusion to Perry Ford. Even though my car is an older model, I always get treated as if it were brand new. Renato my service consultant, is always very attentive and has my best interest in mind when servicing my car. My options are explained to me in detail, allowing me to make the choice that best fits my needs and my budget. Thank you Perry Ford.< /text>

<Review>Perry ford was awesome to me ! Juan and Mario worked together to get me the best deal when I was stuck in a bad loan at 18% . My monthly payments went down and my interest went down to 4.9% ! They addressed every concern. I'm a young college student and this is only my second buy on my own but I couldn't have asked for a better result.Even their finance department broke everything down for me to make sure I understood every detail ! Thank you Perry Ford !<//Review>< Pics>

I was treated with the outmost courtesy respect and professionalism from the above mentioned people. I have experience in buying new vehicles and I did not feel pressured. They went out of their way to make sure I left with the vehicle of my dreams at a payment I could afford.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PERRY FORS NATIONAL CITY.

<review>Juan in the service dept was the best! As a walk-in on what was clearly a swamped day for them, Juan managed to fit my vehicle in regardless of the fact that they weren't taking any walk-ins. I was having some serious concerns related to my brakes and he took mine and my childrens' safety into consideration. I honestly could not have asked for better customer service! Plus, he didn't attempt to sell me anything extra and was super straight-forward with me about costs and comparison, which I really appreciate. From now on, Perry Ford is the ONLY place I will go for my truck's servicing needs!

Side note, the sales guys are super aggressive and bothersome, so avoid being spotted by them if you are going in for servicing. They're so bad, one of them mistakenly tried super hard to sell a new car to their own shuttle driver when he came to get me out of the waiting room, smdh.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Just had my Raptor serviced at Perry Ford National  City
.the service advisor Germain Carrillo was the absolute professional that you could hope for.As I shared in my Yelp review, this young man actually seemed happy to be at work! What a breath of fresh air. By the way I believe Perry Ford has a wonderful group of H.R.personel! I was also treated very well by a young man by the name of Darren Bruce..< /text>

Renato was a great help! I took my 2013 Ford Focus in worried that I would be playing around $800 dollars for repairs as was my original quote from a private auto repair place, Renato eased my mind all the way by looking up what was needed and letting me know it was all covered under warranty, so needless to say I didnt pay a dime, and I am so grateful that Perry Ford took the time to do what was right for the customer. I may he moving away from the area, but I would recommend them to anyone looking to buy a car from them in the future.<//Review>

<Text>Quick to get me in, great!
Had to keep the car for 4-5 days, gave me a rental car...no problem.
Always kept in contact with me...great.
Would give 5 stars but:
A) car was not washed and it came back DIRTY!
B). Hand written on my paperwork “battery failed test”.  But no one could tell me why or what.  They simply said it was a mistake to be written there...scary.
C). They had to test drive the car for over 60 miles which is fine...let’s get it right.  But to give the car back with zero gas, I barely made it to the closest gas station. Would 1 or 2 gallons have killed them?

I will go back, Germain was good.< /Text>< resp>

Was almost in-n-out of the dealer that same day except for some finance issues which were solved later on. Came back a few days later and was able to get all the paper work signed and drove off in a new car. Rolando was very helpful and if he didn’t know something then he got someone who did. Great customer service!< /Text><username>Luis Arce</username>< gmap_id>

I loved coming to this car dealership! Everyone was super helpful and made me feel like I was part of the Ford Family rather than a mere stranger buying a car. I still cannot believe I have my new car, I love it! Thank you to Perry Ford for helping us get the car of our dreams!!</text>

My appt was @ 9:00, however the car needed 2 new tires, which needed to come from another entity. Long story short, I was there until 1:30! I'm happy with the service, but not pleased with the long wait.<//review>

<Text>Very Satisfied Customer!

Alejandro was very helpful, he even took the time to pick me up and drop me off at another dealership, he listened to my wants and my needs showed me a couple of alternatives, took me out on a test drive and totally fell in love with the Explorer. Our experience as a whole was great, from the beginning to the end, not as complicated as other times at other dealerships.
Celia in the Finance Dept. was super nice treated us as if we were part of her family, explained everything to the dot and took care of us in a very professional way.
Thank you Mario, thanks everyone for a very pleasant experience!!
I definitely recommend Perry Ford!< /Text>< time>

Don’t fall for the other reviews.. This place is a scam. I went there to have my car looked at not only did it take them 3 days to find a simple problem.. They then proceeded to over charge me 50$ for a part and then tried to charge me 900$ in labor where every other service shop offered it for below 500$. people don’t speak good english and they don’t knkw what they are doing.. over STAY AWAY< /text>

<Date>1568676228545</Date><rating>1<//rating><text>Popped my tire on Coronado bridge so it got shredded before I could pull over and got towed here. First of all, it took hours to change a tire and reset a few tire pressure warnings. I was told this up front though and offered a shuttle ride home. So I go home and wait .... and wait ... and wait. I finally call and ask what the deal is and get told my car just got in to get taken care of hours after it got dropped off. I also get told the shuttle is out and will pick me up cause they're on the last run of the day (it was 4 or 5pm, the car was dropped off around 9 or 10). About half an hour later I get a call from the shuttle driver that his route is taking longer than expected, but he's on the way. Another half an hour later and I get another call saying he's not coming for me anymore. This being my only vehicle, I called the dealership saying I need my car back to go to work, to which I get told they can come pick me up the next morning around 9 or 10. Who starts work at noon or whatever time it would be by the time I could pick it up??? Anyway, I told the guy I'm military and had to be at work at 6am. So I got passed over to the service manager. He just replied "What do you want me to do about it?" WTF kinda response is that?? So he "does me a favor" and tells me if I pay for the service over the phone so the service is paid for since they'll be closed before I could get there, I can get an Uber to the dealership and send a copy of the receipt and he'll reimburse me for it. So my wife and I Uber to the dealership and when we get there, we go get the key to my car. When I get home, I realize that they threw my shredded tire in the back of my car instead of disposing of it like they were supposed to. So then I had to go to the landfill and get rid of it. Awful service start to finish. Avoid this place at all costs!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80d9526ab37b6f9b:0xbd37bbd8b865f01e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Requested oil change and to have the tires rotated/balanced. I have been experiencing excessive vibration once I get up to 65 mph. The service technician informed me that it would be $75 for the rotation/balance. After a couple hours after I dropped it off, I received a phone call from service stating that they could not take the tires off since I do not have the key for the wheel locks. I bought this truck from this same dealership without the key for the locks. I was still charged the $75 for rotation even though they never removed the tires. I asked them how I could get a key for the locks and the technician said “maybe an after market wheel shop”. Perry Ford said my tires are cupping and that they recommend installing new tires which they can do there. If they couldn’t take my tires off to rotate them then how would they take them off to install new tires? Long story short, still charged the amount for tire rotation/balance even though that was not performed. I am now stuck with a truck and unable to remove the tires.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>I had a great experience, especially when received with such courtesy from the service personnel. Renato was very helpful, pleasant and taking care of business. Timely, perhaps little delayed due to amount of cars present.  As he said  he'll come get me when done, he did.  Also, taking time to explained certain items was helpful for me to better take good care of my vehicle. I always have good time with service department. Unlike when I cam ed to buy my car,,,. Over all I still recommend Ford,,, to my friends because of the fact that's an American car. I always like to buy USA made. So, Ford you my Five Star all the way.  I wish I could tip the people who helps me there; buy drink or hamburger..., probably be out order.  But I will always consider Ford Dealership 'mine' home for cars...See you in six months or 50,000....Lol. Have a great daily success.😊

Everything was fine with my car once I got it back. I'm only giving two stars because of the lack of communication. I had to call multiple times to find out what was going on and what the progress was. I finally had enough and had my husband call. Of course they step it up then and start calling my husband with all the updates from there on. It was really annoying, considering it was my car. Was not treated fairly at all.< /text>

I got charged for an alignment and was not notified by Patrick or any of the workers working on my car that my left camber isn't aligned and can not be aligned without a camber bolt kit. I should have gotten a call before they continued with any work on my car unless I approved that it was OK to go on without the kit.<//review>

I am reviewing my experience at the auto services of Perry Ford. All the personal was very nice, I spoke with Renato who offered great service, he listen and gave me a set time for me to pick up my car. He called to check in and let me know my car would be ready before the time he had originally told me. The gave me a ride back to work and they even washed my car and detailed it. Amazing service. First shop I go to that I feel like they cared that I understood what my car was getting and why and that they didn't take advantage simply because I am a female. I greatly recommend it.< /Text>

Great dealership! They refused to give up on us coming to an agreement on a deal, and the deal was made. I left there extremely happy with the transaction, and I know others will too!< /review>

<review>We had Jesus help us. He advised us of the APR we were approved for. I took the car home after signing the contract and being told of my APR. I had to go back the next day to bring in a check and sign a new contract. The woman that helped us advised me that I was never approved for the APR that Jesus told me I was approved for. I was then given a higher APR. Jesus of course lied. We were told the gas tank would be filled. They gave me a little over half a tank. Not even that was done correctly. We have another car to buy next month. Celia also helped adding the warranty and the Gap insurance. She could not follow a simple request.  will not be coming back to this place or recommending it.<//review><Response>{'time': 1547492945855, 'text': 'Sarai, thank you for sharing this review regarding your experience with us.

I recently was in an accident and I took my car into Perry Ford to get fixed. Renato was the one that helped me out. He was outstanding! He dealt with my insurance company directly so I didn't have to deal with all that. He made sure my car was fixed correctly with genuine OME Ford parts, even when my insurance company tried to cut corners, Renato made sure everything was done right! Now my car runs and looks as good as new!< /Text>

<text>I give 5 stars to Tony, the service advisor. Aside from that, it’s been a rocky experience at this dealership. I’ve had issues with my 2017 Ford Explorer Sport. I’ve called in with issues from the tires to the sensors and other issues that have come up with my car and it’s been a decent experience only with Tony. Wish it was the same with everyone else. I’ve purchased 3 cars from this dealership and I this past week I had an issue with my car battery. It died on me at the mall. The person who took care of me was not in the best of moods. I made some requests and was not to happy about it.  I asked if my car could be handled by Tony. He said ok. Long story short, I’m not sure if I will be purchasing my sons car in the next month after all. I can’t expect the service advisor (Tony) to work there forever.< /text>< pictures>

Much better customer service than I received at the location in Chula Vista, the communication has been constant and this was the reason why I left the other Ford service location.

<review>Renato, my service advisor, was awesome. They worked with me as the PCM's I had were faulty. I'd buy a new one, didn't work, got a replacement.

<name>Sandra Gil<//name><text>I am satisfied with the car that I purchase however the process was not so pleasant. From the beginning I informed them of my expectations on the APR and the monthly payments I wanted to pay since this is my 4 new car. I knew the process and I knew what I wanted . It took them a long time to process so I needed to go back to complete some important errands and they turn their face at me like I was not coming back. They became friendly once I came back and even like that it took them a while since they assume I was not coming back. Once I had my car for two weeks I received a call since they forgot to make me sign a paper in order for me to receive my license plate so I was told I will not receive my license plates if I don't go and sign the paper. After I sign the paper a month later a receive a charge of $200 since they didn't complete my paperwork. I try to contact them and they send me back and forth between the DMV clerk and the person that completed the paperwork since they were blaming each other they end up sending me with  the sales manager that told me he will look at my paperwork and will give me a call. He never did and after that I was never able to find him and I never received a call back not even after a left a voicemail. Terrible service as an overall.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Always fast and great service. They explain what they will be doing to my car without surprises or hidden fees. Really recommend, they also have great prices and I feel safe bringing my car here versus a self own shop.<//Review>

Car serviced and not even a car wash like other dealerships. Also they make you wait on recalls when repairs are available. I did an appointment for airbag service and its been a YEAR and still waiting. I call and they said im on waiting list, really? Wow, why did i bought a Ford<//Text>

I had a problem with my car. Renato the Service Repressive at Perry Ford in National City, Ca. Was very helpful with the problem with the car. He helped get me a rental car. He texted me about the problem and when it would be ready for pickup. The car was ready on time. Excellent experience. Thank You Renato and Perry Ford. 😃😃😃</review>

I was blown away at the effort, politeness, and respect given to us at Ford. I was at previous Dealerships prior to going there and no one came close. So far everything went fast, smooth and we are very satisfied And not to mention, got a great deal !  A special shout out to Rene Lopez our salesman, without him none of this would have been possible, he went above and beyond to get us everything we were looking for,   He even answers his phone when you call him. !  If you’re looking to buy a car, give them a try, you won’t be disappointed.< /text>

I was a ghost in the credit world & only had about $2000 down towards my new car & no dealership in the area could work something out for me. However, Perry Ford of National City worked their magic & was able to get me into a brand new 2017 Ford Fusion! (great car for the design/mileage/price) The Sales rep I worked with was Rene Lopez, this man was hilarious & he really made me feel like I was family. He gave me no BS & told me how it was. I would highly recommend going here if you are someone who doesn't have a whole lot of credit or any at all! Ask for Rene & watch him work his magic!! Thank you guys so much!!! Love my new Fusion !</review>

Went in for the works oil change.  They found that there was a recall on my vehicle so they fixed that as well.  Upon checking my car, they found that the battery was no good, it was under warranty so that was nice. When I went to pick it up, I was offered a car wash but didn’t have enough time. I was disappointed to find greasy hand prints on a few different spots.  They didn’t even try to wipe them off.  Makes me wonder what kind of work they did under the hood...

Cons- expensive, techs don’t care/attention to detail.
Pros-  Thorough, friendly< /Review>

<text>Excellent service. Renalto is a great service advisor got the job done for 100 bucks less than quoted over the phone. My AC and brakes are great again and I couldn’t be happier. Definitely found the place to bring my F150 back to to get it consistent service.< /text>< pictures>

I bought a car for my daughter that was a preowned. On preowned they check off that the car is in good condition. It is a 2015. This was a spur of the moment and we both agreed we will come back when we need another car. The price was reasonable and the payments were low enough that she could afford. They are very professional and we felt no.pressure.<//Text>

Fantastic, went out of their way to answer all of my questions.

Adding to my review after working with their sales manager yesterday.  He took me through all the features of the vehicle I was interested in, let me test drive it (no taking a drivers license ECT), then absolutely no pressure.  It was the best I have ever experienced.< /Review>

From the minute we contacted Perry Ford of National City they were friendly, helpful and honest.  Our car wasn’t on the lot yet but we worked out the deal, came back the next day to sign and pick up the car.  I was for sure that when we got there to sign the paperwork there would be different numbers than talked about. However, to my surprise, everything was as discussed, no haggle or back and forth.  This was a great transaction. Absolutely would recommend.  Moses was our salesman.  Thank you Perry Ford!!< /text>

<text>Great service. The service department is the reason I choose Perry when I buy my trucks.

Went to have some routine maintenance done on my 2019 f150. No long wait and awesome customer service

Much thanks to Juan, the service writer, for squeezing my truck in at last minute and Perry Ford National City for your attention to detail and making my experience totally positive.</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>When it comes to Perry Ford and their customer service, hands down, they are the best!  Last year was the first time I ever purchased  my 2015 Ford Fiesta. Both Jamie and Alex were extremely professional. Though I can be a bit abrasive and impatient at times, especially when it comes to a car purchase. Fast forward to March of this year. I traded in the 2015 Fiesta for a 2018 and yet again the service was phenomenal. I think it was Manny who really helped polish the paperwork, Arturo and Grace were awesome  for their service. Honestly, if Ford is your preference, then take the risk with Perry FORD National City.< /text><gmapID>0x80d9526ab37b6f9b:0xbd37bbd8b865f01e</gmapID><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

Darren Bruce was my service specialist. Darren is always friendly when I take my vehicle in for service and he is very knowledgeable. Darren keeps me informed on the issues with my vehicle and provides honest solutions. Having Darren as a service specialist takes some of the ache out of spending money. I can trust him. He is honest and tells me when it is necessary and unnecessary to have a service done to my vehicle.

I have had some horrible experiences with other service specialists at Perry Ford, but Darren really cares about the customer.<//text>

Visiting San Diego, on Saturday my new Ford SUV lost power and began to shake. We were towed by Ford to Perry for warranty service.

The best of times, the worst of times. Patrick the service rep is extremely good. He immediately diagnosed an internal coolant leak from head failure. He put us in a rental right away, moments before Enterprise closed. He was exceptional.

Once taken back to service though, Perry's techs misdiagnosed it as just a bad spark plug. They replaced the plug filled the empty coolant and gave the vehicle back to me. The band-aid lasted long enough for me drive home. By Monday it was misfiring and the check engine light was on.

Currently, I'm on my third dealer. Perry was first. The second dealer agreed with Patrick at Perry that it was a coolant leak in the head, but said they could not get to such a major repair for a month. The SUV is at the third Ford dealer now. There's some hope they will fix it. They did notice it misfires on cold starts and the coolant is low. We'll find out soon enough what they do.  I can't hold Perry responsible for Ford's unreliable product, or my unbelievable travails at other dealers.  On the other hand, if the guys in back at Perry has listened to their service rep Patrick it could have been fixed there. Might have been nice.</Review>

<Text>Great service. Germain was great! He was able to get First Extended to pay for my water pump that went out which was still under my extended warranty. Of course First Extended tried to deny the claim as usual, which is obviously a warrantied component, but Germain was able to explain to them that they needed to uphold the extended warranty and pay for the repairs. Which they finally agreed to. I’m still upset that Perry Ford sold me a third party extended warranty when I purchased two brand new vehicles from them. I have had problems with Perry Ford service in the past, but it seems Management has made some good changes to the service staff, and I will definitely continue to bring my vehicles back to Perry Ford for continuous maintenance. I just  won’t purchase any new vehicles from them ever again. Thank you Germain.

Darren was awesome ! I simply cannot describe my gratitude towards him . I had gone to Perry Ford in the past and one of the attendants who I spoke  to charge me for 150 dlls Just for the mechanic glancing at my car . The meeting with this attendant took less than 5 minutes .so I was a bit skeptic about showing up there once more but Darren since the moment I called treated me greatly and worked with me through the whole process . It was just awesome<//Text>

I personally would not recomend this dealership to my worst enemies, they screw you left and right, make promises till you walk out the door with a new car and bam, take back all there promises and make you out to be a liar.  You guys have lost a loyal customer, we have driven and leased fords for the last 15 years, well no more.  Thanks for nothing. Don't deal with the sales manager Cameron cause he just lies to your face and make you out to be the idiot, well the joke is on you.< /text>

You guys are AMAZING! ❤️ I love my car that I OWN. I’m so blessed 😊

My lease was up from ford Carlsbad yesterday and last month prior of my lease expiring Carlsbad ford informed me I wasn’t capable of leaving off the lot with my car to own because of the miles and credit score. If I wanted a new car $3,000 to 4,000 was needed to lease again not to OWN. I left home crying 😢 with my kiddos. I didn’t know who to speak to at Ford.
“felt helpless”. They never took the time to hear what happened personally or even tried other options. Carlsbad Ford GET IT TOGETHER, you don’t know whats happened in a person life ASK It’s called  “Teamwork makes the dreamwork“

THANK YOU 🙏 NATIONAL CITY PERRY FORD ❤️<//review>< username>

<text>Thank you! Bill and Patrick.
We were told by a different mechanic that our truck had a defective part and after investigation of your mechanic, we found out otherwise.  Bill (Service Mgr) was so gracious to have us come down and see the prior work that was done and offered a discount on the repairs necessary to make our truck drivable again.

Renato Segura was the best customer service agent. The whole process went so smooth and he was so helpful. They found an oil leak we didn’t know about and fixed probably avoiding a real problem later.</review>

<text>I continue to have issues with my transmission on my  2017 Ford focus the mechanics continue to not want to acknowledge the problems.

I have problems with my tire pressure in less than 10 months I’ve had to bring my car back to the dealer to either have the transmission or the tires checked out about 6 to 7 times.

I am now scheduled to bring my car in again next week to have the light for the tires checked out and also the transmission that seems to take to long to shift.  I continue to believe that I just got a lemon of car.

Which the for company refuse to acknowledge.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We worked with Sam at Perry Ford, and he was incredible! He found us the perfect car for our growing family. He even found us the color that we wanted which three other dealerships told us was unavailable. I highly recommend asking for Sam at Perry Ford if you are in the market for a new car. We called him before coming into the dealership, and he had the car that we wanted ready and waiting to show to us the next morning when we arrived. Financing was fast, and we couldn't be happier with our new vehicle. Car shopping can be stressful, but Sam made the experience very pleasant and we left feeling great about our deal and new ride!< /Text><username>Tara Welch<//username><response>{'time': 1537476312074, 'text': 'Tara, thank you for taking the time to leave us such a great review!

< Review>
Zero stars! Horrible experience with an office employee named Dario. I was very fortunate that the owner Mr. Perry happened to be walking by and got involved and helped me solve the situation. The best service representative at Perry Ford Service Department is Mr. Reynato. Other then that good luck getting Ford to honor any extended services for example Simonize,extended service plans.<//Review>

<text>MIKIE PEREZ!!!! What a breath of fresh air!!!! After a long day of pushy, arrogant, deceiving sales people at 4 other dealerships, I was about done and was just going to keep my car and weather the storm.. My wife and I then met Mike who was not only funny, but polite,& FAR FROM PUSHY!!! and knew the product well got us past that door! He made my daughter feel at home, put a video on for her so we can discuss the details and what was the best most HONEST deal that wouldn't leave us regretting anything...
He put it all out there, all my options and listened to both my wife and I concerns... Landed us on the right vehicle even my daughter fell in love with and a super deal I couldn't refuse.. The deal was so great he didn't have to sale us or push us, in fact the least pushy sales person I have ever met across the board!!!! I RECOMMEND NOT ONLY PERRY FORD!!! BUT MICHAEL PEREZ AS WELL!!!! HOPE YOUR STILL THERE WHEN ITS TIME FOR A NEW CAR ONCE AGAIN!! I WILL FOLLOW YOU MY FRIEND!!!< /text>< resp>

Arrived early for my appointment and received help immediately, which was great! Germain, my tech, was super helpful and friendly- I was impressed by the text I received which let me know that was my point of contact. But my appointment was at 1 and I didn't hear back until 3:30, which came through saying my service was just finished and my paperwork was with the cashier. When I made the appointment, I was told the oil change and inspection would take 1-1.5 hrs, so that's the time I had planned... definitely didn't think it would be 2.5 hours to get any update. So glad I wasn't waiting in their waiting area all that time. I love the people and the service here, but since this pace isn't local to me, I may not risk the inconvenience of being so far from my other obligations for 1+ hour longer than ecpected.<//Text>

The general manager was very understanding of my extra concern in regards to my deflating tires and he actually had it checked for free but the service department did not find any problem with my slowly deflating tires and did not get to fix it.

There was no problem with the oil change and it lived up to my expectation.

The service advisor was very helpful. However, he shoots from the hip when I had questions about the carbon monoxide service recall that was done to my car. He was not knowledgeable on this subject and gave me false information on what was installed and inspected when I asked what was in the final invoice documents.

I would come back and hope service would be better.< /Text>

Two stars for having two awesome cars in their showroom (GT350 & Shelby Super Snake!!) but no stars for customer service. I myself am waiting for the revamped 2019 GT350 and just stopped by to show the wife the 2018  because she's never seen it in person but we got paid no attention really and just got weird looks...oh yeah and the GT350 has a $30k mark up & the Super Snake is $45k over sticker lol< /text>

I brought my car in at 7 in the morning for my 60k tune-up and even though they had a few appointments ahead of new they managed to get me my car back by 11 a.m. very satisfied with the service and my car keeps running just as good as when I bought it.
Everytime I bring my car in for the works package oil change with an appointment my car is ready within an hour or 2. I always get told what is possibly going on with mmt car and cam plan for any repairs I may need in the near future. Once again a job well done.< /text>

Excellent customer service, you feel welcome and taken care immediately!
I was a Penske Ford customer because it was closer to home, but Perry is the industry standard in service.
The extra miles are worth it!
Thank you for your commitment to excellence, you’re building customer relationships for life!

Sincerely

Roberto Verdugo<//review>

Do not go here for any vehicle repair this is my first bad review the service personal are very unprofessional and worried about there face book then your vehicle and will tell u bs and if you want to speak to the gm here will not call you back bottom line bad service.

Update I returned on Monday for my truck and spoke with William haas he made things right and took care of the problem. My truck is now good as new. Mr. Haas understands the importance of a job truck and personal insured it was done right.
Thank you</Review>

Thank you, Eric and Mario and Omar!!! I had been considering buying a new car for some time. I had test driven three other models of cars and Ford was the last one for me to test drive before making my decision.
I am so thankful I did the comparison driving and found Eric when I came to Perry Ford. I have not met a more knowledgeable sales person of his model cars but also the competitors. When I brought up things I liked about the other models, Eric acknowledged the aspect and showed me how Ford was different and better, or how Ford was similar with more. He helped me narrow down what was most important to me in the vehicle and helped me find it. He was not a pressure salesman in any way. If he had been, I would have left immediately. He encouraged me to think about it because he wanted me to LOVE the car I would be driving for a long time.
When I finally decided (I test drove several cars with Eric), Mario stepped in to find the best deal, with the discounts and other opportunities available through Ford. Additionally, Mario shopped around to find the absolutely best APR for the amount I needed to finance.
When we settled on the price, Omar put the paperwork together, shopped again for more local rebates, discounts, etc. He was able to reduce the price even more. He was extremely helpful and thorough in talking through the contract with me making sure I understood everything before asking me to sign it.
I cannot speak highly enough of the team at Perry Ford in National City. Each person knew what they were talking about and did not make empty promises. Each has followed through in every way. I feel I have a new automobile community.
I would recommend them without hesitation.  Thanks, guys! I love my platinum Ford Edge!!!<//text>

My experience was overall a very smooth and easy process.  The people at Perry made well aware of the process when it came to my purchase. The finance department seemed to get a little flustered with all the paperwork which led to me having to return back to the dealership more than once soon after having my paperwork for finalizing nothing to big.  When I bought my vehicle I noticed small problems with it which Perry was very quick to take care of and had them resolved within a matter of a couple days.  Overall and standard working well rounded group of workers.<//review>

If you are looking to buy a car and don't want to deal with pushy salesmen, Perry Ford is the place to go! Patty was amazing and did all she could to ensure I drove off in my new car. She made my first car buying experience easy and stress-free. I would recommend Perry Ford to anyone!

Thanks Patty!< /Text>

Showed up for my appointment no waiting. Updates on work progress were left on voicemail. Repair was completed as promised, truck washed before I picked it up. Price as quoted. What’s not to like?</Review>

Renato in the Service Department was great. It's nice that he took the time to explain in detail what was done to our Escape S and how our Escape S came out---100%! He asked if I had any questions and to remember that if we needed anything to be sure and give him a call. Great people.</Text>

< review>
Enjoyed Perry ford service dept when Tony was their always top notch service last time their had air bag recall done with the works oil change got a call saying tire had a nail it would be 59.95 to repair it I said no not at this time well went to discount tire for free flat repair they said someone intentionally took off a weight for balance that's why we left dealer and tire was shaky no oil change reminder sticker car wasn't washed and tire was altered never ever will step foot at Perry ford again spent thousands on service over the past few years ps never had issue with tire looking air it sits in the garage for weeks at a time got home next day tire was leaking? Money before return customer motto stay away from perry. Since this review Perry leaves a typical response and I understand the need to respond to great and poor reviews what yelp does(and its great) gives a little power back the consumer to help or warn potential customers Well they failed this loyal customer incredible but buyer beware hoping to locate just a reputable repair center</review>

<Text>Always get a 2nd opinion. If there were negative stars that what I'd give them. I took my edge in because it was leaking a fluid. They told me the transmission, condenser and the power steering all needed to be replaced and they could fix it for $3200. I went to Midas they found the loose hose and tightened it. Topped it off with a little transmission fluid and I spent $115. They didn't diagnose anything but charged me for not looking. Then tried to steal my money. How do you people sleep at night. Here I am 4 months later with no leaks. Terrible feeling that your getting ripped off....<//Text>< pictures>

The gentleman who helped me out did what he could to accommodate my need for an oil change and general check up for my vehicle. However I was a little disappointed at the fact that I did not receive this as a complimentary incentive like I had been told over the phone. It was the first time that I had the oil change done for this new vehicle. Also, I had to ask about the details done to the car since I was not told verbally. I am used to having a service manager or whoever, explain the details to me after finishing the work even though they might have given a breif explanation prior to servicing the vehicle. Overall, the staff was friendly and attentive.<//Text>

I bought a 2018 Ford EcoSport in January 2018. The first week of April 2019 I noticed an issue where my RPM’s were jumping and the vehicle would kind of jerk/struggle shifting into gear. I took it in and they advised me my coolant reservoir was cracked and I would have to pay out of pocket to fix it and that this was what was causing my issue. I know, it made no sense to me either, but it needed fixing sooo? Needless to say, after getting it back, I took it back in two days later for the same issue and long story short, they tried to say they wouldn’t cover a rental due to me not purchasing their extended warranty... negative! No one told you to sell me a car you can’t fix! They ended up coving it, but they kept my car for TWO MONTHS, and when I called Ford after the 6th week to resolve it and stated “I want you to buy this car back under lemon law” -it was approved. After two MONTHS, and never hearing from the manager, he finally calls me (per the buy back team asking him to do so) and when he realized the car was being bought back, he hurriedly told me he would just reuse the existing original part- that was on backorder, holding up this process- and in the end returned me my vehicle absolutely unfixed staring he would no longer “store my vehicle or cover a rental” and returned my vehicle to me with the SAME TWO MONTH OLD issue. Now I wait until Ford and I settle this separately. I’m a single mother in the city of San Diego, and I get to just wait, and drive an unreliable/unprepared BRAND NEW car. Thanks Perry!
I will say they are getting 2 stars solely based on the crew in the service department, they are a great crew. Otherwise, it would’ve been 1 star.
Taking my business elsewhere.</text><rate>2<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I purchased a 2016 Ford Fusion, the service over the phone was great days before I came in and it was just as great when I was there.  They worked with me on the car of my choice and the price to get my car payment to a reasonable point.  The staff was friendly and they all helped entertain my son for the five hours we were there completing the purchase.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great communication from the service adviser Darren and the Tech Jose Zuniga, they kept me informed of all problems I have with my van. They offered various solutions to fix the problems and then completed the repairs as promised. The reasons I am only giving 3 stars is the the complementary car wash does not appear to have been done. Also there is grease, oil, or some kind of fluid foot prints on the drivers side rug and floor mat rug.</text>

<Text>Overall horrible service and manger is the dumbest person he isn't helpful at all and everyone working their are a group of liars who don't want to take responsibility in fixing a car I bought their and Perry Ford is the worst car dealership ever. Everyone who works there are a bunch of fakes who only care about selling a car and don't want to fix after a few weeks.  I have spoken to everyone and no one wants to fix the problem.< /Text>< user_name>

I took my 2011 escape in for two new tires. Was told I needed alignment charged 100 dollars and all numbers were same only one that was different was change .1 degree they then told needed to schedule another appointment on a Monday-Friday to fix the measurement that was out of limits. Receive my car back and I had asked them if they could put new tires on the front due to it being front wheel drive and they were placed on rear. Ive had great experiences here in the past with oil changes/two new tires year ago/misc services but last few times been complete 180 from those experiences.< /text>

< review>
A place to be wary of. My family has bought 3 cars from this dealer, so you would expect to have a trusting relationship with the people here. Boy was I wrong. I go to take my Ford fiesta in for service, and let them know there is an small issue with the battery.  When I go pick it up, they let me know they did a service on a recall, no charge. The oil and filter changed, and that the battery had been changed. I go to pay, they have me sign the paperwork and pay. I sit down to wait for my car, and the worker behind the desk, comes up to me with another paper to sign. Remind you, this is after I paid!! I'm checking the paperwork, it doesn't say battery change on the paper,  but just tightened screws on battery connector. As I leave, I check the battery of my car, it's the same battery, the maintenance rep lied to me!! I've been there for 3 hours and the service department is closing, so I leave to come back the next day to deal with that issue. When I park my car at my house, apparently these mechanics didn't do their job right, my car won't change gears, stays in Park. I then have to go to the dealer in a borrowed car, they have to tow my car to the dealership, I have to be present when they tow the car, and then have to go back up the dealership to talk to the manager. This wasted my whole day. I let them know I don't want the same service rep, due to his lies and want to talk to the manager. The manager treated me like a kid going into the principal's office, with the worker present while I explain the situation to the manager. The worker was just waiting for me to finish my part of the story so he could be, saying he didn't say that and that there is no evidence. Well lucky for him, I had the paperwork to show and prove that all documentation wasn't presented to me at the time of paying, and that they could check the security can to see the worker present more paperwork while I was seated, waiting for my car. I got refunded and will never do business with this dealership, or Ford ever again. I have an Audi nownow  couldn't be happier.< /review>

Took my 2016 Ford F-150 in to get some of the recalls taken care of, but most importantly update my Sync 3 so Apple CarPlay would work in my truck. Patrick was great regarding customer service, but he was the only person there that actually cared about what I was looking to do.
When I initially called the person on the phone had no idea if they could even do that (YouTube answers most questions). That was unimpressive. Then when I showed up on the day, the staff still was unaware if the truck could be updated. I had to wait for them to see if they had a part in stock. To top this horrible experience off, when I showed up later Apple CarPlay (the main reason I took my truck there) was not installed properly and didn’t work. It was at closing time and I ended up paying for a service which was not completed  remotely correctly. This is where the staff not understanding how to bring Apple CarPlay up and check it for proper installation really upset me. Now I have to get it installed correctly and waste more of my time doing so. Shouldn’t have paid for something not done correctly. Getting rides to and from is another thing I’m not looking forward to. Time means something to everyone. How do you plan on making this right Perry Ford of National City?< /text>

Having issues with my 2016 fusion and the dealer refuses to fix it, they lied about testing driving it since my insurance has a GPS tracker the car never left the dealership, I have extended warranty and besides that it is still under factory warranty, dealership lied to my face about test driving it and that transmission slipping is "normal" for these cars. If nothing is done I will be taking them to court.
Forgot to mention that they said I would have to pay out of pocket! I was upset and told them I shouldn't have to pay when it is still under warranty and I purchased extended warrantt that covers eletronics, bumper to bumper, and powertrain ridiculous! Stay away from this dealer they just want your money.<//Text>

Good job!  Recently went in for first maintenance work on my new Focus SEL and had little delay in getting service done, even though I was late getting to my appointment. All contact with personnel was pleasant and courteous. Amenities were adequate and seating was nice. My attendant, working from his desk in the back right corner of the intake office, couldn't have been more helpful. The work was all done and the carwash afterward gave me a feeling of having that new-car feel restored. I will definitely return for regular maintenance!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I visited the Ford in Chula Vista and was very disappointed with the customer service. I called before visiting to book an appointment and it was scheduled for 3pm. When I arrived a young lady who work there told me I would have to leave my car overnight which I was upset about being that wasn’t said when I booked my appointment. All I wanted was for them to check what was the issue causing the door gasket to have water leakage but they refused to do even do that. To them I would have to leave my car overnight no matter what. I asked to speak with the Manager to see if there was anything he could do for me but he was no help. He told me I would have to pay out of pocket for a car rental when my car was covered under warranty. I didn’t understand nor agreed on why would I have to pay out of pocket for a rental when my car is having manufacture defect and it was covered under warranty. I explained that to him and his response was “Well we can’t afford to lose any money neither” Really?! You’re saying that to a woman in military uniform. I would highly not recommend going to this Ford in CHULA VISTA especially being the second time I have encountered a disappointment.

I decided to leave and go to a different dealer. I called the Ford in national city. Renato agreed to take a look at my car first thing in the morning, he also warned me that I would have to leave my car overnight which I appreciate. I arrived there and he explained that if they could find the problem I wouldn’t have to pay out of pocket for the rental. I was very satisfied with his service and he was so helpful. During the process he worked hard to try and find what was causing the water leakage.

<text>Service was fine but you should be more like Kia. No matter what you bring your car in for they always leave it washed and sparkling clean. The last two times I was at Ford not once did you bother to wash my car. It's the little things that matter.</text>< rate>

<Review>I bought my car from Juan at Perry Ford in National city and they are amazing and the most professional and polite people I’ve met. Renalto takes care of my service paperwork for my car and he’s always so upfront and honest about what I need done or what’s wrong with my car. Overall ive never had any problems with them they have been amazing.<//Review>< pictures>

We just bought our SECOND car from Perry Ford in three months. That's how good the service has been for us both times. Not that I need to say more about any the reps, Antonio, Hussein and Sam have been helpful without being pushy. We came in with a clear idea of what we wanted and what we didn't need. Hussein showed us around with no complaint when we moved onto our third and fourth car. Thanks Hussein. Sam oversaw the deal and explained everything and gave us a deal on a car that was not on sale. Thanks Sam. Then their supervisor/boss gave us good options for finance again without being pushy. Overall another great experience here in National City.</Review>

<Review>Do not have work performed here if you are concerned about quality or customer service!!!! Terrible service from Service Director Bill H.  They replaced my clutch in my 2018 mustang under warranty. After which time it began binding at high RPMs when downshifting.  Went to the dealership and met with the service director Bill, who sat in my car, while sitting still, pushing my pedal in and out, telling me he doesn't feel the problem. Even after I explained to him the problem occurs when down shifting from sixth gear into fourth gear at high RPMs. Following that pleasant exchange (Bill was very argumentative and condescending) I get a call two weeks later telling me they're denying responsibility.  How this man is the service director I have no idea, though do not get your car work done here. They will only cause more problems and then say the problem is not their fault!!!</Review><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

<Text>The great service continues even after the purchase! I bought my car from Patty last year - I recently had a question about a service issue and contacted her with my concern. She immediately answered my questions and went the extra step to have the service manager contact me as well. It's great to know that the customer service extends beyond the moment that the contract is signed. Thank you Patty! I love my car :-D</Text><user_name>jicelle ochoa<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

I have taken my vehicle here for service on a few occasions. The service reps are generally friendly but every time I go to pick up my car after servicing, I always find something on the car that no longer works that worked prior to me dropping off the car. I often feel that they overcharge and when something goes wrong (1st they ended up replacing parts that did not need to be replaced and 2nd they lost my key fob), they "offer" a comp oil change in an attempt to smooth me over. I'm not impressed and will not return.<//text>

< Review>
I was coming to the end of my lease, and was looking to buy my next vehicle.  I stopped by Perry Ford and worked with Patty who was very helpful and answered every question I had.  She didn't use the pushy, car salesman tactics that we've all become accustom to, and made my husband and I feel completely at ease with every concern we had.  We bought our car, which we love, and it was the fastest and easiest car purchase we've made EVER!< /Review>

I am truly satisfied with the service at Perry Ford of National City.  I highly recommend them. Tony Cubero and his team are always welcoming. Thank you guys for everything you do and especially working through this recent pandemic. Stay safe.

Excellent service at Perry Ford National City.  It's always good to know that I can trust Tony Cubero. Tony and the service crew always take great care of my vehicle. Thank you.

New post.  Not the way I wanted to start the new year 2020 but Tony Cubero was there to provide the best customer service from beginning to end. Service was fast and also applied for the Ford credit card which helped me out a lot. Thank you Tony and to the staff at Perry Ford in National City.< /Review>

Nothing went well.  My car was getting "serviced" for 7 weeks. I wasn't informed or updated on anything. Parts, problems, status on my car the whole time. I had to call them every single time for an update. My car was returned with a dent on my bumper. The only compensation I'm getting is $655 for my two months payments. I have paid $500 payments for the whole life of my car and still I can't even be compensated for $1000 instead of the car note payments. I'm punished for paying extra instead of the minimum payment.  I want out of my car completely. This has ruined my ford experience of always wanting a mustang my whole life. I can't stand even looking at my car especially with a dent now. Never again will I be buying a ford. I will let everyone know my experience so they don't ever buy a ford either.< /review>

I went for a recall that was suppose to take 1:30 but got out six hours later. This place has bad management. I should have been notified within minutes that they did not have parts, but instead they made me wait and kept telling me that it was going to take a lil more every time till they decided to tell me that they were unable to receive the part and they were gonna finish another day. They did not offer anything to satisfy my long wait for their mistakes. Once I showed my frustration all they had to offer a loner vehicle and fill the gas on my vehicle which was already more than half filled, not to mention that I still have to fill the gas on the loner back the way they gave it, and a minor detail. Very unsatisfactory  zero stars if I could. All of this could have been evaded if I would have been notified correctly.  I even tried calling for appointment but they told to just present myself.</text>

Great place to purchase a car, I walked around with Michael Perez (no relations) and he was very charismatic and helpful never got annoyed by all my questions and always with a smile on his face. I believe he even came in on his day off to help me close the deal. I will recommended to anyone looking to get a new or used car.</Text>

Worst dealership.Went in expecting to lease a vehicle and the salesmen was incredibly rude critiquing us for not being as “successful” as him when he was in his 20’s. Insulting our choices and downgrading us to the max in front of his coworkers and other customers as well. He realized he had said too much, but by that time we had made up our minds. We went to Honda instead and got ourselves a new leased car. The staff there was beyond caring.< /Text>

<review>Kim works in the service dept at Perry Ford.  She a service writer and does a fantastic job, plus she knows more about cars than the service techs at the other ford dealer thats located off the 805 south  & main street ( dont go there...lol).

As a matter of fact, all the service writers at perry ford was nice and professional.

Thanks

< Review>
After hours of trying to negotiate, the Sales Manager finally came out to tell me I wouldn't be getting a better deal anywhere else (lie) and if I didn't take their last offer I wouldn't be able to come back at a later time and take the same "deal" they were giving me. Don't waste your time here. El Cajon Ford put a BS to the side and gave me a better deal!</Review>

<Text>3 stars for daniel for doing his job,
But If there is a -5 star that's how I would rate this place! Never purchase your vehicle here! The first time you step in to their dealership, they know you so well, and after you signed all papers from them and closed the deal, the next day they do not even know who you are! THIS DEALER SUCKS! The agents and especially the guy that handles the Finance, (Moises) will rip you off, basically the way they offer prices double after! they are so desperate to sell! And will offer you a low price and add warranties to top off the charge and they get paid more. The Manager won't even answer your call! Called customer service many times, transferred me over and over and everyone hang up!

I purchased a 2017 dodge journey and it's vibrating, the agent(Marvin) said it will be taken cared of, but the next three days they do not know customers anymore, they don't prioritize you after you purchased a unit from them even if it's under warranty!!! I left my Suv to get it checked and on the third day they stil haven't figured it out. NEVER! NEVER purchase here!!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Name>Ron Richie</Name>< Review>
Bought a new F-150 from them. Signed a contract, then a week later they called and said that we would need to put more money down and the interest rate nearly doubled because the truck was a brand new 2016 not a 2018. Untrustworthy bait and switch sales practices. My advice, Do Not Purchase a car here. Come to find out they did something similar to a close friend of mine who also bought a car from them recently.<//Review>

< Review>
I have a 2016 Ford Fiesta, that I got from this place, and I just took it in for an oil change.  I asked for them to look at a plastic piece that broke on my driver's seat.  I was told they would be happy to.  When I went back to pick up my car, the piece was not fixed and I got charged $118 for them to look at it.  They wanted an additional $170 for it to be fixed.  I feel very taken advantage of and mislead.</Review>

This was probably the WORST experiences I EVER had with a car dealership. They put new meaning in the words UNETHICAL and DISORGANIZED. My husband and I stopped by last week because we were looking for a car for our son. We had a specific price range  The sales person showed us a car that fit all of our criteria and after a test drive, we decided to purchase the car. We sat down and started to fill out the paperwork, when suddenly the sales person informed us that the car had been sold and was no longer available.
At that point in time, we requested that they do not run our credit report, as the paperwork had not been completed. No worries, he indicated, they were not going to run it and they were  going to make it up for not being able to sell us the car to us with a similar offer. To our dismay, he came back with a car and price that was $5,000 over our budget. After hours wasted  we left disenchanted as it became apparent that this dealership  uses bait tactics to lure customers in,  but  are unable to sell the cars at the prices they advertise.
To make matter worse, when I checked my credit report on Credit Karma, I saw that Perry Ford had run a credit check, despite our request not to do so. Undeterred, they continue to call us. This Saturday, we were contacted by 3 different sales people  (who obviously don't talk to each other ) within  30 minutes of each others with offers that do not meet our criteria. (Advice: do not give them your contact info). One of them begged us a to give him another chance, that he would check the inventory and call us back within 90 minutes with another offer. Of course, he never called back....another broken promise. This is what Perry Ford looks like!!!< /review>

I was locked into looking at a car at this dealer. I had to close my browser and then re-enter all my search criteria.

I cannot sing enough praises for Perry Ford National City! I absolutely love the customer service my husband & I have received every time we have came here. We've shopped around a bit to just see other options, truly nothing compares to the guys here. We've been here in California a year, never met anyone as kind & genuine as Sam. We are now purchasing our 2nd vehicle in 6 months from this wonderful team! When we came in Sam had Robert "Internet Sales Manager" helping us, we were weary at first, but Robert quickly assured us he was just as kind & knowledgeable as Sam. I can't imagine going anywhere else after having customer service so fantastic, our kids even love being here!< /review>

Previously had a great experience shopping here for my wife's explorer.  All service after had been terrible.  6 hours for an oil change, 8 hours for front brakes that were incredibly over priced and each time had a early appointment.  I wouldnt recommend getting service done here as appointments are irrelevant and prices aren't competitive< /Text>

<text>People in the sales department are rude. Sales manager is a rude and he is also the reason I will not be returning to any of the Perry  dealerships. I regret purchasing a vechile from them. I have had nothing but issues with my purchase. And the sales manager makes me feel like it is my fault. Ricardo in the service department has been very helpful and respectful. He has helped me a lot really stand up guy. But sales department is the absolute worst< /text><Name>brandon Lupo</Name>< Pictures>

Well it was not what I expected really. Not so much because of the service adviser although I do have some recommendations for Him. Maybe paying a little bit more attention of what the service adviser say and more important be aware that you meet those promises. I understand sometimes there are several people coming in, but not the day I was there. I was told I was going to get notify if the parts were there to do my 2015 f150 recalls, and if not then I could leave. But after 1 hour of waiting I went back to the service guy and he said “oh sorry, forgot to let you know they are working on it already”
Not a big deal but a little bit more communication would be amazing.
Then after 2 hours, while my truck is being repaired, the electricity of the ENTIRE dealership went off, I would of imagine they would have come backup, but they don’t, not even for the service section. Soo for about more than an 1 hour nobody’s as working on anything. But the worst part was that my truck had been done for 30 minutes and he service adviser did not even take the time to tell me about it. Many of the workers just went to lunch and did not while the electricity came back.
I had to hunt down somebody/anybody to tell me if I needed to go home because of the shutdown or if my truck was going to be worked on nor not, but there was ABSOLUTELY no service adviser. Finally there was this amazing cool lady worker there that help me track down my truck and told me that it had been done for the past 30 minutes.
Once I left the dealership, I went home and when I got there and opened my drivers door (it was closed) it was really hard to open, like the little stub was stuck. I called the dealer and they said “oh man, that again” so that let me to believe that they know about this issue and DO NO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHEN RECALLS ARE BEING WORKED ON for the 2015 F150.
So I went the next day to the dealership to get that fixed and they derive adviser said that I did not need any paperwork to be process because it was a simple fix, and they did fix it. The result of that was that the mechanic disconnect some window plugs and I was not able to lower the window from the driver nor the passengers controls. So I had to come back again and have them check it...
I kind of not wrote all the details about what happen because is tooo long.
But it was not what I was expecting for a company that sells soo many cars and works on many cars. I would expected a little bit more professionalism.< /review>

NOW HEAR THIS: I have been from coast to coast buying cars, trucks and SUV,s  and my recent purchase at Perry Ford could not be matched. If you are shopping the auto mile save your time and set a course for Perry Ford. I had no hassle in purchasing a vehicle from Perry Ford. In matter of fact General Sales Manager Mr. Mario Lupinnacci and salesman Mr. Mushy Alzayadi went overboard in finding the vehicle I was looking for. Mario and Mushy would be a part  of my crew anytime. Their can do attitude, attention to detail and professionalism is 4.0 (squared away). BRAVO ZULU!!!

I hate to write negative reviews, but I feel like the people/community should know. I recently purchased a 2018 Explorer Limited. Shortly after my purchase the vehicle started to make a whistling noise from the engine compartment. Initially the noise could only be heard while in “park”, and eventually graduated to all gears. On 2/1/19 I made an appointment (@ 8:30 AM) to have the vehicle inspected. I was greeted by an employee Kim and voiced my concerns. Before turning the vehicle off and handing over the keys I made sure she acknowledged and heard the sound. At approximately 2 PM Kim called me and stated that the vehicle was not making the noise anymore and there was no way for them to look into the issue. 30 minutes after I picked the car up the noise came back. I brought it back to the service department and this time the shop Foreman Eduardo (ED) Cervantes assisted me. He acknowledged the noise and had the vehicle inspected again. 45 minutes later he said he’s not sure what the sound was and was going to get in contact with a Ford Engineer to see what it might be. He also stated in the mean time he will see if any other Explorers were making the same noise (to see if it was a normal sound). On approximately2/10/19 or 2/11/19 Kim called me and said they had spoken with the Ford Engineers and were told the noise was not normal. She also stated they were not able to duplicate the noise with any other Explorer. I made another appointment to have the vehicle inspected on 2/15/19.  So on 2/15/19 I dropped the vehicle off at 8:30 AM. Again at approximately 2 PM Kim called me and stated they weren’t able to find any issues with the car and the sound it was making was considered NORMAL! I then spoke with the shop Foreman and he reiterated what Kim said . The sound was NORMAL and there were no issues. I went back and forth with him for a few minutes before I escalated the call to the Service Dept. Supervisor Bill Haas. I voiced my concern and he sounded like I was bothering him, however he said he would have a engineer meet up with me (with in a week) and tell me why it was a NORMAL sound and why the vehicle was making that noise .  Fast forward to today 3/1/19. I still have not heard From anyone at Perry Ford of National City. However what I did to was take my vehicle to El Cajon Ford. With in 3 hours not only did they Diagnose the problem (a leaking PCV valve) but they fixed it!!  A $9 part was causing all the noise and commotion. It’s a SHAME that Perry Ford has these lazy negligent employees working for them from the top of the department to the bottom Except Kim, she was always professional). If you are in need of getting your vehicle serviced I recommend you skip over Perry Ford and head on down to El Cajon Ford. They have a great staff and they KNOW what they are doing .

I was car shopping for a reliable vehicle because I had a baby on the way and I wanted something that I could rely on as well as something safe for my newborn. I went to several dealers on the mile and the experience of just test driving a car was awful. I then decided to go to Perry Ford, and was greeted with a smile and respect. The employees there were so helpful and courteous. Patty was so helpful and made me feel like she was really interested in my needs. She paid attention to my requests and paired me up with a great SUV. I love my car, I have plenty of room for my baby's things and most important I know he is safe in such a reliable vehicle. Thank you Patty for all you have done for us!</text>

<Text>I will never go to Perry Ford again. I have been getting a tremendous amount of SPAM email from them ever  since I used them for service on my F150. I also get marketing calls on my personal cell phone from sales reps wanting me to trade in. I've unsubscribed online 5 times, I've called and requested, I've emailed the general manager directly. They simply don't care.< /Text></record>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>About a year ago, we leased a Ford Edge from Perry Ford, and put a $15,500 cash down payment on it. Recently, we decided to upgrade to an Explorer. I called Perry Ford and asked them if the down payment for the Edge would be transferable to a new lease, and I was told by a salesman named Aldo that some of it would. Fast forward to today.

After a week of phone calls from Aldo, we finally go in to the dealership. We asked, first thing, how much of the down payment would transfer. We were told that it was dependent on the car that we chose. At one point, a dealer demo Explorer with 4,500 miles was offered to us. We asked what the discount for the 4,500 miles would be, and they said that there was none... so they were trying to sell us a USED car for a BRAND NEW CAR price, stating that since it was the demo, it had never been registered with the DMV,and was, therefore, new. Obviously, we declined.

We finally found an Explorer with all of the features we wanted. We asked again how much of the $15,500 would transfer, and he did a lot of beating around the bush and asked to run our credit to figure out financing options for the new Explorer. We told him not to run our credit, because it was irrelevant if we weren't going to get enough of the down payment to transfer. Finally, he came out with a paper about the financing options for the Explorer, based on average credit, and a very carefully-worded explanation of how the Edge would be "taken care of", we would owe nothing on it, and he quickly tried to talk about the Explorer again. We asked about the Edge's down payment transferring (seriously, broken record, anyone?) and he finally admitted that it wouldn't. I asked why he had stated that it would over the phone, and he blamed it on his manager, saying that the manager had told him that it would, and then went back on it and said that now it wouldn't. We asked for our keys back, and he went to get them and the manager. The manager said that a down payment is only good for one car, and doesn't transfer. Okay, I can understand that. That makes sense, if that's your policy. What I don't understand is why Aldo said that it would, over the phone, and then hounded me for a week to come in, after giving me false information.... and then when we finally get there, he kept putting off the questions about the down payment until we found the car we wanted.

It's extremely insulting that he assumed he could lie to me, hook us with a car, and then have us so starry-eyed over the Explorer that we'd sign away the Edge and flush that $15,500 down the toilet without hesitation. Seriously?

Like i said, I can understand not transferring the down-payment. But lying to customers is never acceptable, and if that's the kind of business that Perry Ford conducts, then I don't want any part of it, and I will recommend others to steer clear of them, too, in as many reviews as I can.<//Review><user_id>110440240573731233952<//user_id></record>

Purchased a pre owned 2013 pre owned car last 2016 in your outlet. Had oil change last monday, and was told everything was checked (brake, battery, engine). A day after, my car won’t start because battery was dead. Wonder why  that happened when it was just recently checked and was told everything was ok. I bought the battery and have it done by a nearby auto shop because your service center rep said it’s not under warranty already. I missed a day in work because of the problem.  Not a good service center, not taking good care of clients!</text>

< review>
I have left Service (Germain) two messages and Finance (Celia) one message and so far no one has called me back. We bought a used vehicle without knowing the heat didn’t work, so we took it back. Perry had the truck for two days and the heat problem still remains. We got this truck for my husband upcoming trip to Oregon. After it was in service for two days, we picked up the truck and it was guaranteed the heat was fixed. Withing hours my husband left to Oregon and he realized the heat was still not fixed, my husband went through a snow blizzard between California and Oregon without any heat in the truck! I’m not happy about this situation, I want Perry to pay for the fix in Oregon, my husband will be there for a month and the temperature there right now is in the 40’s. I’m not a person that writes reviews but this is outrageous.< /review>

They kept asking me about my pay stubs I previously worked at dealerships and sold cars at around that time most dealerships/banks don't require pay stubs now.

During the sale of my car, Breanna; the salesperson that sold me the car told me that the first oil change was free if I bring the car to Perry Ford for that service. When I mentioned that to Patrick; the service advisor, he said there would not be a free service. He even told to get Breanna to talk to him. Breanna called in sick. I therefore ended up paying for the first service to the car. It seems there’s a disconnect between sales and service and service is not informed of the promises made during the sales.<//Text>

When I bought my car from this place they tried to play hardball until I got up and walked out because I didn't want to deal with the finance manager's crap.  The service department is just "okay", there have been times when they have forgotten to do things they said or forgot to call me when my car was ready.< /Review>

I purchased a 2018 Ford F150 for less money than my brother purchased his 2014 Ford, used in 2017, from another dealership.  Needless to say, my brother is not very happy, but I am!  I'm very grateful to the staff at Perry Ford: Nader, Jesus & Mario... they all came through for me & did their very best.  I'm super happy with the vehicle, the price & the service. I specifically got a truck with the front seats as a "bench seat" so the center-console flips up when I want a 6th seat or flips down & I get that wide arm-rest & 2 cup holders.  I love having the option of the 6th seat, should I ever need it.<//Text>

Sold me a used car with multiple issues, wouldn't fess up to their mistakes.  If you're buying a used car here, buyer beware.  They will tell you that they've inspected the car, but I would definitely have it looked at by an independent mechanic.

I got a good deal on the car, so I'm not over what KBB says it's worth (even after the repairs), but it's just very shady of them to pull this sort of tactic.  Definitely won't be coming back.

You might get lucky with a new car, who knows.< /text>

So me and the wife decided to head down to good ole Mile of Cars. After a few looks at the truck it became apparent we were there to get my wife a new car :-) Qais Shams was our salesperson. He was very knowledgeable about the cars and you can tell he has a passion for the automobile which I do myself and could appreciate. Qais wanted to put us in the right car and made sure to be honest about any shortcomings a particular car would have for our hobbies/lifestyle. We ended up choosing the 2019 Mustang and got a helluva deal! We got treated like royalty there could swore I was buying a luxury car. At the end of the day Qais made sure to come through on his commitment to put us in the right car for her at the right price. I highly recommend Perry Ford to anyone out there interested in getting that new new truck or car. They will work with you! They said they wanted my business and they definitely earned it... Speaking of which... I keep dreaming about the F-150 XLT Qais... I may end up back there this month!<//text><username>Victor Svehla< /username><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1539532437338<//time>< rating>

I bought my Ford Escape from the Perry company so I trusted them to be honest with me when my car was having problems starting.  That was a big mistake.  They stuck me with a massive bill and now after doing more research, found they overcharged me considerably.  I've now spent all my vacation funds and they've even now tainted my desire to ever buy a Ford again, let alone any other vehicles from Perry locations.</Text>

<text>I shopped at multiple dealers, they all treated me well, but Breanna at Perry was active from the moment I submitted my request online. She contacted me and I told her exactly what I wanted and she had it the next day. Gave me a great price on a brand new 2018 Mustang GT. Loving my new car and the way I was treated at the dealer. GM Mario and Breanna both worked with me to hit my price range. Cecilia in Finance explained everything to me and my dad so clearly, those contracts can be intimidating but not with her. 10 star experience with the whole crew but Breanna busted her hump to make me happy. She went above and beyond for me.

<text>The dealership has a truck advertised on their website and I went to look at it. First two salesman could not find any information about the truck. I was then passed off to a Director named Breanna. Breanna had no idea about the vehicle so she passed me off to Mario. Mario said the truck was in Colorado and would take some time and effort to get it to his lot. I called Breanna the next day and said I’d buy it if mechanically sound. Breanna has to pass this along to Mario and will get back with me. I had to call Breanna once a week for three weeks and every time got the same response “let me check with Mario and I’ll get right back with you” which never happened. Called for the 4th time today and was told by Breanna that Mario would not be bringing the truck to his lot. My response was it would have been nice to let me know that long ago. Breanna’s response “oh I left you a message and you must not have listened to it”.

Here is my 2 cents for Perry Ford:
1. Don’t advertise vehicles you don’t have or won’t sell. You are wasting customers time and efforts.
2. Be upfront with customers who are trying to buy something from you. Don’t try to sell them something else they don’t want.
3. Follow up with potential customers as you said you would.<//text>< username>

< Review>
Just don't go here. Unless you either like wasting time after your purchase, or you have some strange desire to get into the business version of an unhealthy relationship....I'd stay away. Long story short, they took almost 9 weeks to CORRECTLY activate my enhanced GPS tracking service that I paid extra for at time of purchase. All after being told repeatedly that it would be taken care of, yet I had to keep being persistent because it wasn't being handled. Then I was told that I'd get 2 years of free maintenance. I said I wanted something in writing with specifics because the follow through on words had been brutally awful up to that point. I was informed that I would receive my documentation of "free maintenance" including what that would even entail - my car surpasses the quarts that most "free" oil changes cover. It's been another month, and I have received no such documentation. BUT - I will say this: after finally getting my GPS set up properly I decided I'd let their actions speak because I'm tired of their words, so I committed to not call about the maintenance. And my life has been SO relieved of stress. Hahaha. Whatever, I'll go to Mossy instead. They have a Quick Lane and better reviews anyway.

Great service all around as I purchased my new Mustang! Gustavo and Breanna were both super friendly and awesome to deal with! So were Mario and Celia. Everyone, actually but those 4 specifically as I had the most contact with them.

Unfortunate update here: The buying process was still A+. Unfortunately, I had some add-on items that I purchased and it's been a major headache getting activation on one of the items - rather not specify what in this forum. I have visited the dealership personally to get this resolved and was told it'd be handled the following Monday. That was a couple weeks ago. Nothing happened. Went back in this Monday and watched as an employee entered my info to get activation on this service I purchased. It only took 10 minutes tops so I'm not sure why I had to wait a whole month and be so pesty to just get it done. But then, the info was entered incorrectly so my service is active but it's active on a different car on the Perry lot. I called again last night, about out of patience at this juncture and was told this would be resolved first thing in the morning. It is now after 11 a.m. the next day and I"ve heard nothing. There were also some non-returned phone calls during all of this. This is WAY BEYOND NOT COOL. Perry Ford is great at getting customers, apparently they do not put the same effort into keeping them. That's some free, constructive criticism right there for you. The most irritating thing about this whole ordeal is that it truly feels like I'm the only one this is important to. Newsflash: I just bought a brand new car, I'm not supposed to have car stress for quite a while now.</Review>

Received a recall message for the transmission.  I called two weeks in advance and scheduled an appointment.  A week before the appointment, the service advisor tells me that with the appointment, I'm looking at 24 hours just to figure out the problem even though i'm bringing it in for a recall, he then said this wasn't a considered a recall and even with my extended warranty, they wouldn't be able to assist me with a rental and that the car would need to stay with them at least 5 business days.  So do to a ford recall issue that will take a week or more to repair, I will be out of pocket the expense of a rental car.  I wish i could go back in time, read the reviews here and/or on yelp and stayed far away from this nightmare of a dealership.  Nothing but issues since the purchase of the car 1 year ago for this used 2014 Ford Focus.<//text>

Qais although only being there for 3 weeks, displayed extreme knowledge of any question that I had. With the help of the big boss in charge named Mario, Qais the expert salesman, and Diamond our wonderful finance person, I was able to walk away in a brand new 2018 Ford Fusion SE with everything I had asked for, exactly in my budget.

< review>
This company is full of thieves. They have sent me several contracts that were back dated, they took my down payment and still took my truck while it was getting fixed!  I put new tires on the truck $900 I got a rental car that they promised to pay me back for $840. I am now $3750 in the hole from this company. They claim to be taking the truck because I didn't sign the 100th contract they sent me while I was sick and in the hospital. I would advise staying as far away from the company as you can. I have hired the Auto Fraud Center to help me.< /review>

< review>
I would have rated much higher except for one thing, which I will elaborate on. I am new to the area and came in looking for a used car for my wife. The actual car buying experience went well. They worked well find a car within our budget and fit our needs. However, leaving the dealership I noticed the car clearly was not running correctly. So the entire next day I spent trying to get ahold of my salesman. (Who's name I will leave out). I called probably 15 times. Called his cell. Left messages with the secratary, I was not fired up, I wasn't yelling or anything like that. I just wanted to ask a few questions. I finally gave up on that and called the service department. Which were a great help!! I worked with Darren, he was super professional and helpful. He made sure the issue was fixed and the car is as good as new. Super happy with my experience with the service department. Shout out to Darren, Blanca, and eddy for your help. I would give them five stars. I am concerned that it wasn't fixed before being sold, but not sure who's fault that would be. The lower rateing is because it had now been 3 days since purchasing the car and I still have not received a call back from my salesman. Not impressed with the sales customer service at all. I don't think I will be back when it is time for a new truck.</review>

<Text>Thank you Dario tremendous help on getting me the bedliner that I needed.

Since these guys don't even bother to care about their Yelp or Google review I decided to post one since they bribe me and lied to me about a survey. Once I completed it they would give me a bed liner for the truck I got for them which $47,000 truck is in enough to cover a bedliner so the truck doesnt scratch. I asked him what were my options on returning the truck what were the fees since I did a deposit but he didn't even bother to tell them to me his attitude has been very unprofessional and he is not a man of his word.  DiCarlo is the name unfortunately he told me to trust him he is a new sales agent but he is a liar he told me the manager that was working when I purchase the car is no longer working there but when I showed up 2 weeks later the manager was there with the same job at the same place that DiCarlo told me he no longer was. The only reason I traded in my previous truck was because DiCarlo called me twice and told me that my truck was above market value that I could get any newer truck and pay less which has never been the case since they tried to take way more money since the very beginning I'm still paying more all I ask was for DiCarlo to give me the bed liner and this has become into a pretty big problem for me the truck is all scratched now thank you LIARS. I Will not purchase more vehicles from you Dicarlo since you cant even seem to know whose your manager or who to ask.</Text><UserId.>116290167267343320197</UserId.><rating>5<//rating>< Resp>

He didn't emailed me the diagnostic paper work even though he said he would send it by getting out of work. I called him and didn't take my call but finally sent me around 11pm.but the details were wrong. I told him this was diferrent from what he told me and text me but he just said what he sent me was all collect. I don't get this. His email was actually wrong compared to the paper work. I could not trust him any more so I decided to go with other ford dealership. He didn't even mark the 50 points marking? paper and didn't give me the cords. Casher found it and said it was unusual.

<Text>First of all I purchased my vehicle 01/02/2016. Didn't get to actually drive it until 01/29/2016. The car had a TON of mechanical problems. Total inconvenience since I stepped on the lot.   I don't understand why it was even on the lot for sale. My car payments are EXPENSIVE for a 2012 corolla. Now they are sending me 2 statements saying I owe $75.00 for DMV fees. Which I am not paying by the way. I put $2,500 dollars down. That is the dealerships responsibility. I am no idiot. Since the dealership has FAILED to provide me with registration I no longer have insurance coverage and my registration is suspended due to them NOT DOING THEIR JOB.  They don't even return your calls so I am writing this review because they care about their reputation MORE than their customer service. LASTLY I will NOT  be taking this post down either. Everyone needs to know DO NOT COME HERE!<//Text>< Date>

If I could give this dealership zero stars I would, I purchased my vehicle less than a year ago and began to have issues with the battery and when I came in to get it checked out they wanted to charge me 130$ just to check it, the service center is horrible and rude, I asked to speak with the sales manager patty regarding the issue and her response was comparing the battery to a light bulb that it would eventually go out keep in mind my car is a 2014 and that it wasn't there problem. When I responded with the fact her comparing it to a battery wasn't acceptable and the battery having issues was unacceptable she proceded  to tell me once again it wasn't there problem and basically told me there was nothing they can do about it! Horrible service I would never recommend anyone to this dealership nor would I ever purchase a car here again! This dealership is a complete joke and so is the management</Text>

I came there in morning to test drive a Ford Focus se. Didn't attend to buy today, but Aritairy and Sam treated me really well. They are patient and don't push. They also helped me with choosing right insurance. Most of all, they offered me a great deal which I can't decline, eventually I came back with a white Ford Focus SE! Highly recommended!< /review>

Came to do maintenance on my mustang and told me to wait on the customer care area to wait for a shuttle, that I was going to be called to go home. Been here 30 min. And told the service lady that at what time was the shuttle departing and she told me "the shuttle just left like 8 min ago. We can't do anything because drivers aren't allowed to use cellphones." Now I'm stuck here for a hour or more just for a slack on discipline with the driver and his roster... I got stuff to do. Hope this doesn't happen again in the future</Text>

<Review>Perry Ford of mile of cars are crooks they take advantage of hard working people I was sold a lemon and although I paid for an extended warranty it doesn't cover any of the problems I'm having with the car I bought three months ago. The first week I had this car I WAS pulled over by the cops while out of town for not having any lights in the back come to find out there were no bulbs period in the car. Then I took it back because it didn't want to start and of course just like the radiator hose that blew the starter isn't part of my extended warranty. OMG and Kirk Guzman the salesman that called me and came to my house ten times almost before I bought the car each time as nothing to say.... Smh shame on you...<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Do not waste your time with this place. Let me start by saying, this poor excuse for a dealership use to do my 3,000 mile and warranty check ups. On good days, they would have me schedule an appointment, then proceed to wait for 2-3 hours after my scheduled time before they even took my car back for the oil change. Not only would they return my car to me with oil and dirt inside the car, but recently I found out that they haven't even been topping off the fluids in my vehicle, and in some instances not rotating my tires which i paid for. (I found out about the tires, because I mark them)

Aside from their poor maintenance team, I've been receiving regular phone calls from this pitiful establishment asking me to trade in my car. So, I decided I would give them a chance. The lead sales manager calls me, and says he will give me $13,500 for my car, and he's got a used truck on the lot that's just been marked down from originally $24,999 with an unspecified new price tag. I told him I was in the military, and didn't really have the time recently to come in. He asks me "what will get you in the door?". I told him flat out that I would be willing to come in if I could keep my payments at around the same that I'm paying off my current vehicle for. He then proceeds to tell me that he could guarantee that, sends me an email with my appraised value of trade in, and schedules me for an appointment. I show up to this wretched place, and walk to the secretary and give her my name. She says, "I'm sorry, but I don't see you on our list for an appointment." So I gave her the managers name that called me, and told her I was leaving. As I'm walking to my car, this guy runs after me and says he'll help me out.

The details of this story are drawn, so I'll cut to the point. I gave them the keys to my vehicle to test drive it for the appraisal, get back in my car and notice that my class ring that sits on the flat portion of my dash is missing. I ask to talk to the manager, and pretty much tells me tough luck cause there are no cameras that cover where I parked (in their customer parking lot). Their grand deal that they offered me was a whopping $24,799 off the truck.

This branch is a disgrace to the Ford line, and I stand firm when I say I will never purchase a vehicle from Ford again. Do not waste your time with this worthless excuse of a business.</Text></record>

<review>To be perfectly clear, I never even made it to the dealership before I was turned off by the unethical and misleading business practices!

I'm in the market for a new truck, checking out options. So I put out feelers to all the dealerships and found a vehicle offered by this dealership that especially got my attention. Needless to say I schedule an appointment, get all my ducks in a row to go and take a look at this vehicle, perhaps purchase it. ALL to be told that the vehicle is actually $15,000 more than what they have listed for! 15k!!!!
So then I'm told we have plenty of similar vehicles that we can put together for you cheaper than this one. So let me get this straight, a misleading advertisement combined with a ballooned price!?!?! No thank you...

There's no way this is a "clerical error"...if so, to be off by nearly 30% is a pretty big mistake and should have been caught immediately, yet they allowed it to be advertised as such for atleast the three or four days I had been watching it.

Bottom line, it's clear what they were doing and all who visit this dealership should do so with extreme caution. There are enough Ford dealers who operate ethically with complete transparency in the county to be giving these guys any business. Please beware of this dealership...

I've purchased two vehicles from Encinitas Ford in the past 5 years and have always been treated like a valued customer there...I think I'll give them my $50k<//review><Date>1493248494645<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pics>

If you're looking to buy a car or need help with finding a car ask for Renée. This guy was respectful and very helpful and put me in a car even though I didn't think was possible because of my credit but sure enough with his help we were able to I really can't explain how much I appreciate this company and Renée for putting me in a car. It has made my life way easier instead of taking the trolley everywhere. If you go here ask for Renée he will help you find the right car !< /review>

WORST dealership I have ever dealt with!! The process has been nothing but a disaster and the GM John Carlson is the biggest JERK I have ever dealt with, most incompetent staff as well but look at the leadership. The right hand does not know what the left is doing. The so called 90 point inspection on a pre owned vehicle is a total joke. The truck was towed back to the dealer same day we bought it and back in service again.  BEWARE of this place do not waste your time or money!!!!</text>

We had a great experience here at Perry Ford!!!!! Our Ford Expedition needed a new engine. It was not worth the headache and $$$$. Got a awesome deal. Our dealer Vikram Kumar "Vic" was helpful. Did not pressure us into buying. We ended up with a beautiful Ford Fiesta....great for what we needed. Advice do your homework first...look online to get an idea of what you want. We were online looking with the assistance from Vic even before coming into the dealersip. When we got there,  he had several vehicles ready for us to check out. Great job Vic. THANK YOU. Retired USN veteran and family.<//Review>

<user>105469284905519289635</user><username>Random Things< /username><Review>Purchased a used vehicle here a few years ago. Car had to be towed for repairs shortly after. Luckily, they fixed the problem free of charge because they knew it was their responsibility. But the main reason for 1 star is that they made promises on the written contract that were not honored. It would have been a small cost for them. They kept giving me the run around until the service agreements expired. Its too late for any legal action but I will definitely be telling everyone possible especially all the military members at the base nearby about my experiences here. I still have the old contract as proof to show them.<//Review><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80d9526ab37b6f9b:0xbd37bbd8b865f01e<//gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1479230954383, 'text': 'Thank you for alerting us about this issue.

Had a horrible experience here.  Their sales tactics were very dishonest.  Claimed repeatedly to have a van with exact specification in stock but didn't.  Condescending aggressive sales person.  Then continued to lie by phone and email.  Took business elsewhere.<//Review>

Disorganized would be an understatement.  Looked online and found the specific car we wanted, called down with the stock # and was told the car the was on the lot, drive down from north county and low and behold, the car had been sold a few days ago.  They had an alternate car that worked and the new sales manager was able to work with the price, but the car was in poway, so we had to wait for them to pick up, which was fine, but they didn't send anyone for the car until we spent an hour filling out forms.  Then we had to wait for the car to arrive before the finance people could complete the transaction which all in all took 4 hours.  They sold us a car care program that is cumbersome to use and not as they advertised.  Trying to call to talk to someone about how to make payments (as we still haven't received any paperwork 3 weeks after buying the car) has been a long and painful process filled with lots time on hold and dealing with clueless people.  By comparison, I purchases a Ford from Encinitas Ford the week before and it was a night and day difference.</text>

The financing department was terrible. First, they didn't get the financing approved that we agreed upon and I had to drive back down there and let them know that they were going outside of the terms of the signed contract. Secondly, I have attempted to call several times regarding my previous car's payoff documents. Meanwhile I am getting late payment notices and collection calls since they have not completed this process. I attempted to text Giovani several times but he does not respond since they got the sale already. And now, right on cue, my vehicle clicks when turning to the left and it has less than 20,000 miles. I will never bring my business back to this company and will continue to let everyone I know how poor of a job they did so that others won't have to go through this type of hassle.<//text>

Found a '14 Focus in bright blue with only 5000 miles on it. That was all fine and dandy. Got a fair price on it. The thing that really set me off is when I asked to put $1700 down on it, they messed up my paperwork, and accidentally took that off the purchase price. Then they called me a week later saying that I owed that $1700. They f-ed up the paperwork and I ended up paying more out of pocket than I was comfortable with. They messed up the paperwork, they should have eaten the cost of that. But no, even though I told them that, I still had to pay that extra $1700. Plus, I was only given one key. Really? The car is practically brand new and you only have one key? Recently, my ignition switch broke and I brought it to Penske Ford who said I needed another key to reprogram the new ignition switch. So there's another $200 down the drain due to Perry Ford. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Don't waste your time. If you want a new Ford, go to Penske Ford near La Mesa. Plus they have a lot more cars to choose from.</text>< user>

John Rodriguez is the best. We were looking for a very specific car and color and he found one and had it trucked down from Santa Barbara for us. When we showed up it was fueled up and detailed with a beautiful bow. The paperwork was almost complete and all of the preliminary BS completed before our arrival.The GM, Zack, introduced himself and congratulated us on our acquirement. The price was actually $7000 less than Ken Grody ford and we got more car than he was offering. Everybody was friendly and helpful. The dealership has extensive inventory and I found so many colors I hadnt seen before. I highly recommend John Rodriguez and Perry Ford in National City< /Text>

The day started out great with one of the salesman showing us multiple cars and allowing me to take my time to do minor inspection on each of the vehicles i was interested in. After 4 hours it came down to two vehicles. we had two deals on the table and we chose one of them before we had to check into our hotel because, the hotel was going to release our room to a standby. I was told they would get all the paperwork ready and when we return everything would be ready to sign. after returning to the dealer the car we wanted was returned to the lot and the salesman was no where to be found. they gave us a different salesman and after 15 minutes of waiting he told us we no longer have a deal and we need to look for another car. At that point me and my pregnant wife left and bought a car in the area instead.<//Text>< pictures>

First I want to say that this is the first time I have written a positive review for a car dealership. Yesterday afternoon my wife and I intended to go down to Perry Ford in National City (we live in Escondido, 55 minutes away). Robert the internet manager had given us an incredible deal through some online negotiations and the Costco Auto program. When we showed up Robert had Sam take us through the paperwork. He was very friendly and made us feel at ease. We took a look at the new Expedition XLT, and were very pleased. The price was great, the service to this point was great. As we were going through the process, my wife looked at me and helped me realize that our 03 Expedition was still kicking (200,500 miles) and maybe we can hold off until she becomes unsafe or a major mechanical problem occurs. So we ended up walking away from an incredible deal with an incredible interest rate. Why? because we didn't necessarily need to spend a good amount of money just yet. I assumed Sam and the folks at Perry Ford would change their demeanor. To my surprise Sam was fantastic, he understood it was a large amount of money and that is was our money and asked us to keep Perry Ford in mind when we do purchase our next car. I will tell you that Perry Ford earned a future customer, the no pressure attitude and ability to negotiate via the internet made the process a breeze. This morning as we carpooled to work and school in our 03 Expedition, we felt like we made the right choice, but are still excited about purchasing a new Expedition in the future, whether it is a 2015 or 16 we will be starting at Perry Ford! Thank you Robert and Sam!< /text>

I came to Perry Ford with a very specific list of options that my family needed in a new Explorer. My wife fell in love with the Dark Side Metallic color so that was added to the list. They did not have an explorer that matched what we were looking for. The sales manager did some digging and found the only Explorer for sale in California that had what we wanted, and a whole lot more. We were originally looking at the XLT models and this one was a Limited. They worked their magic and got the Limited into my price range. My wife loves it!!! Thank you Perry Ford team!!!< /review>

< Review>
I leased a new 2014 Focus titanium.  I had a guaranteed price through AARP but of course by the time Perry Ford was done with their sleight of hand paperwork I really had no idea what the car cost.  It was implied that I was going to get a $1000 rebate but that didn't happen.  The car itself is ok.  I was trying to be a good american and get a car that was at least built in America but it has a recall on the transmission now.  The shifting has always been terrible.  When this lease is up I am going back to Lexus.< /Review>

<review>Came into to the dealership with $41000. Ready to buy an 2 year old 2016 "new" exsploer, that was a left over due to the ugly color.  The Saleman Manny was awesome. However the rest of the place is a JOKE! Needless to say I left at almost 10 pm (pregnant wife 4 weeks due) without the truck and pissed because they wouldn't let me buy the truck, for my business, with my business check..... But they could take a biz check and never told me this after driving me to my house to make the deal.. But they would take it off my business debt card.....JOKE! Never waste your time there cause that is there business model. Wasting people's time!< /review>< Pics>

By far one of the most delightful dealerships I have ever been through.. I spoke to one of the internet managers (Mike Perez) and told him I have never had any good experiences when shopping for a car.. I came to the dealership strong and ready for the worst.. After everything was said and done I couldnt believe he not only put a smile on my face, he kept his promises after purchasing my new vehicle, he called me the next day cause there was a key missing, the next day there it was in my mailbox!!!! GREATEST EXPERIENCE THUS FAR!!! SEE MIKE IF YOU WANT A STRAIGHT UP/NO PRESSURE RELAXED EXPERIENCE!!!!  I hope he is there when Im ready for another in the next few years!!!< /review>

<Text>This place is a joke. My Sister in law and husband bought a car here and the wheel was completely bent. They had not relized this when they bought the car and had not until some one behind them was so worried they had to flag them down and draw it to their attention. Her husband works at night so I accompanied her to the dealership a couple days ago to show them the issue there. A manager came out and agreed that" yes that is so rusted it had been that way for a while".  He was a very weak individual with a weak handshake and I could tell he knew he screwed up when he agreed that this should be fixed. He knew then his GM would not aprove the repair but went along with it so we would be on our way. Bue the way he was wearing a Spiderman T shirt and off supposedly on a Saturday? And the GM not there on a Saturday off too? In the car business guys this is the best day of the week what kind of GM takes off Saturday and an off duty manager handles a customer issue? Well now her husband is sitting at the dealership waiting for the GM to come handle everything in which they are refusing to pay for. I knew this would happen the minute I walked in this place I could tell that's how they do business. With 165 reviews and 3.5 Stars I would be doing everything I could for my customers to earn and retain thier business. Maybe if they fix the problem for us I will not go out of my way to slam this place as much as I can and then I may take down my review.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1492190143077, 'text': 'Thank you for alerting us to this issue, Jason.

<Text>The service department is crap. Do not bring your vehicle to this place for service. I had to have my truck shipped from Baja Mexico to San Diego because of a Diesel Exhaust Fluid System Fault. We left our 5th wheel trailer and dog in Mexico thinking we'd have the truck repaired and we'd drive down to get them.

They had the vehicle for a week. Went to pick it up and got two and a half hours south of the border and the engine light came back on. I phoned them from Mexico and told them we were on our way back and to please arrange for a rental vehicle and accomodations. My vehicle is fully warrantied and shouldn't have been a problem. They essentially said "too bad so sad".

They had the vehicle for another week. One of the many screw-ups was they test drove the wrong vehicle. Seriously? Plus they couldn't refund my $100 deposit on their courtesy car until Monday. I found it the charge was applied wrongly (as a sale as opposed to a pre-authorization). So after another 20 aggravating minutes someone figured they could.

Then they had to find the Gerry Cans and DEF Fluid I left with them - another 15 minutes.

Many unreturned emails and voicemails. I couldn't get updated on my truck.

BRUTAL experience. Avoid at all cost.</Text><Name>Barry Burko< /Name>< rating>

<Text>So my sales man did his job. I got a 2014 Nissan sentra with 18,000 miles on it. When we received the car we were told everything was checked blah blah blah. I still had the Nissan warranty on it which made the sale for me.  This was july 2016. A few months (3 to be exact) go past and my check engine light cuts on. My car starts running sluggish and burning alot of gas I emailed and emailed my o so friendly sales person but i got no response.  I took the car to the Nissan dealership and the say my fuel injectors need to be cleaned and i need a new air filter . Which will cost a few hundred to fix because the warranty i was told about only covers manufacturers problems. Its now January 2017 and all kinds of lights come on in my car including the check engine light . Theres no way this car had a full inspection like they said it should</Text>< Response>

I first received an email from the promotions department offering a car for a good price.  I decided to make an appointment to see the car, asked if they still had it and was told by the internet sales manager that they still do.
I drove down there, asked for the internet sales manager who then introduced me to a salesman who then informed me that the car was sold the night before.  I then asked for the next car on the ad that was smaller model.  They did have that one but would't listen when I told him I had my own financing.  I asked for numbers to be run without pulling my credit so I would know what the final breakdown would be.  The salesman went back 3x to the office and each time told me they need to run my credit.
I walked out.
The next week I received another email offering a car for another good price, emailed the same internet manager telling him of my experience above, he apologized and asked me to come in.  I again asked if the car I wanted to look at was in stock, he said yes but that I should be aware that I wouldn't qualify for the promo price because I am not active duty military (I am a female).  I was insulted, asked him who told him that and that no one ever asked.  His assumption that because I was female I was not military was over the top.  I still went in to see what was up(my fault  for that).  Surprise, surprise I was told the car was in Transit.
I got offered another car on special that was 5k over what I wanted to spend, politely declined it and asked for the numbers for the car I came in to see be run.  They did this time without running my credit and asked me to sign a contract sight unseen.   I was not sure about that so again I left.
The next day I had decided because it was a new car with warranty I would sign the purchase contract with a few hard limits.  I was working on setting up a time to run my credit, do the papers and finish the deal when I was told the limit for the deal was Sunday.  I double checked the ad and it said by close of business Monday.
Between the lies, sexism and bait and switch, and the high pressure tactics I would avoid this place.  I plan on reporting this to the General Manager of the franchise, Ford Inc., the BBB, my command so other service members don't get lied to, and the National Automobile Dealers Association.  I have all the emails.<//text><Name>Stacy Schorn<//Name></record>

I had a few issues with the truck took it to get a few scraches fix and some touch up done, a manager by the name of Sonia had promise my wife the a dent on the passengers side door would get fix, never heard from her, she claim she would email me when it could get done, well that never happened. So now check engine light comes on and I'm worried due to the fact that I'm going on a family trip over weekend and i want truck to be reliable. I email Sonia she got me an apoitment show up the service advisor Henry Sariol real nice person got my truck check came back he said the reason your check engine ligth is due to the fact the purge valve and the filler tank need to be replaced he said its your lucky day we have the parts, I ask how much to get work done he said  parts and labor 558. 92 I was blown away how expensive it would be to get my engine ligth off i declined the services, I took it to a shop by my house and the mecanic clean it out reset my computer at no charge and engine ligth off.

<Text>Was in the other day, wanted to sell my car, not buy one, so I ask what they can give me for it and my sales person told me to hold on so he can talk to the manager TERRY TOUDLE. He did not sound or look interested in my business, he sat there telling me a number that they were offering, and I mentioned a counter and he said to take it or leave it. He didn't even get out of his chair, did not look at my vehicle. Just went on kbb and looked up what the trade in value is. How is Terry even a manager? He is terrible at his job and customer service. Please replace him. Because of him my visit there is a one star. Go somewhere else if you're reading this.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1506367727184, 'text': "We understand that you had a frustrating experience but need to know more regarding your recent visit.

<resp>None< /resp><Text>*5/9/15 update: I was contacted by the general manner about my experience. Also met with the service manager to get the issues worked out. They fixed the cause of why the check engine light was on, but about a day later the check engine light came back on again! Took it in again and finally got the car back this morning. the car seems to be running a little differently at the moment, the RPM's are running a little higher than they were but I'll give it a few days and hope it just works itself out. The service manager and general manager made themselves available and were very easy to work with. The salesmen I worked with were all very nice too. I upped my rating to 3 stars because they did contact me to resolve my issues. I just wish the issues wouldn't of occurred in the first place. will update as time progresses.

*Original Review 5-3-15* Bought a used car there. Tried to negotiate the price with them but they didn't budge, even though they initially said they were willing to negotiatw. After settling on a $5400 price and waiting for 4 hours I finally got to the financing department to pay for it. When it came time to sign agreement and pay, they wanted to charge me $5800 (almost $5900) dollars!!! I reviewed the paperwork and this guy tried to make me buy a $300 gps/theft deterrent tracking system (skylink). First he wanted to sell me an extended warranty which I declined. After signing some papers he handed me a skyling card and said "your car comes with skylink" and gave me some Info. Later when it came time to sign the final paper with total sale price I refused to sign because that is not the price I talked about with the sales reps. He tried to say the reason it was higher was because of "taxes". That the tax rate was 8.75%in my city instead of the 8% there at the dealer. I'm am accounting major and i did the math. the difference in tax rate was ONLY that of $35. No joke. I reviewed the paper and he tacked on " SKYLINK" for $300, right next to "optional". After I caught this he tried to say he ADDED skyling for me and LOWERED THE DMV fees. I told him to take it off and he tried to pressure me again saying the DMV fees would be HIGHER in that case and that he was doing ME a favor. I caught this as well and asked him why DMV fees would be higher of that is not controlled by him, but strictly the DMV guidelines on fees and taxation? He had no answer and just said I would " probably get a bill" later on charging me the difference. I didn't let it phase me and got the price down after he took the service off. When I paid and went out to get my car I saw one of the guys from service department in my car and they told me they had to "uninstall a GPS device" because I probably "didn't want them to know where I was at all times". They were obviously removing the skylink since I had no interest in paying for it and they realized it right before I walked out. Went home with a used car that night. 2 days later the check engine light came on and discovered the right bulb was out. I would not buy from here EVER AGAIN. I only bought it because I liked the car and it was what I was looking for. It was overpriced though and I realized that. Will not be back. SHADY.</Text><Date>1431202845353</Date>< Pics>

From the meet and greet to the demo ride, right on thru to the finance, and then to the delivery, Carlos Bazan, working with the GM, John Carlson, made the whole buying experience enjoyable and glitch free. With Carlos's guidance and his positivity we ended up buying a new Ford Focus and a Ford Fusion. I swear he didn't drop anything in that free Starbucks coffee. Thanks again, Carlos, for making it happen. We will spread the news to our friends and relatives to only buy at Perry Ford in Nat'l City and see Carlos Bazan.  Your friends, Gary and Jean Pflueger<//Text>

<Text>I dont think their Financing department or team is very good at getting people financed, I applied there two years ago and they could not get me financed, even if I had good credit, they just put a bunch of hard credit inquiries in my credit report, after that I decided to go to mossy ford in Pacific beach, they got me finaced for a new car without any problems, 6 months latter I bought another new car for my wife, I just got a new truck from Bob baker (a $70,000.00 truck) got finaced in the first try

Im my personal experience I would go to any other dealer but perrt ford in national city, maybe it was my un lucky day.... who knows< /Text><time>1433629349386</time><user_id>112465500557342233926< /user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x80d9526ab37b6f9b:0xbd37bbd8b865f01e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>If you're looking for great friendly customer service then this is the ford dealership to go to. I just bought a Ford explorer sport today after wasting 4 days at kearny pearson ford. I regret going to kearny pearson ford dealership first and wasting my 5 days there without getting any result. I got a call from perry ford national city and they asked me to come in and give them a chance to help me getting the car. Mr. Sam their internet sales manager this morning and he asked me about the car I wanted. I went there at around 4pm and got done with all the paperwork and other stuff in 2 hours. I would highly recommend everyone to go to this dealership and ask for Mr. Sam or Mr.Hussein. I am sure they will be very helpful and will make sure that you get the best deal possible.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! The salesmen are scammers left and right. Every time I went to see if I could fix my car with these guys they'd charge me half the outrages price they offered the very next day I turned them down. Tried to trade in my car and they only wanted to give me 3 grand for the appraisal, while going to another ford dealer up in Huntington Beach payed off the whole 6 grand loan I had on it.</review></record>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very bad experience, very little ethics, and professionalism. They do not know how to organize their papers when buying a car. They make you go several times to sign papers they forgot. Definitely not professional. Totally disappointed.

(Translated by Google) How unpleasant and bad experience today with this dealer disque because the sales service is useless, the seller who attended us suddenly left us there waiting for him and never came back to see us after doing a test drive of a red chevrolet camaro convertible If you don't feel like selling or working, don't do it, period. This vehicle with damage to the paint all around and the hood of the convertible does not work and the seller said look for all the defects because once you buy it it will be your problem car trash they sell here and they do not tell you.

(Original)
Que tan desagradable y mala esperiencia ahoy con este disque dealer porque el servicio de ventas nomas no sirve para nada el vendedor que nos atendio de pronto nos dejo ahi esperandolo y nunca regreso a atendernos despues de hacer una prueba de manejo de un chevrolet camaro convertible rojo si no tienen ganas de vender o trabajar no lo hagan y punto. Este vehiculo con daños a la pintura por todo alrededor y la capucha del convertible no sirve y el vendedor dijo busca todos los defectos porque una vez que lo compres sera tu problema basura de carros venden aqui y no te lo dicen.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This morning I was in perry ford national city because of a problem with the tire of my new mustang that I just bought them, it only has 400 miles. The person who attended to me can be called a service. He didn't even bother to check the tire. He just sent me to Discount Tire to have the tire repaired. Service and terrible attention. I asked to be contacted by the service manager who was not available.

Esta mañana estuve en perry ford national city por un problema con la llanta de mi mustang nuevo que les acabo de comprar solo tiene 400 millas. La persona que me atendio si se le puede llamar servicio. Ni siquiera se tomo la molestia de revisar la llanta. Solo se limito a enviarme a Discount Tire para que repararan la llanta. Servico y Atencion terrible. Pedi que me comunicaran con el manager de servicio no se encontraba disponible.<//Review>
