<rating>3</rating><review>The ONLY reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the sushi was delicious! I wanted to give 5 but the girl at the front desk was very rude! I contemplated on if I wanted to spend my money here or not. fyi people can read your body language, she acted as if I was bothering her by asking a question about the menu. I was the only customer in the building, so what was the impatience for? If you can't be polite you shouldn't be the first rude face a customer sees when entering. The guy who brought my food out was much more polite.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I went in for door dash pick up I'm trying to make a living i get reported whenever it's late and threatened with deactivation by door dash. I went to pick up an order but they have a rule where theqy only allowing one person which is smart what isn smart is having 7 orders on the table waiting for pickup and having 10 people outside waiting in line in 60ﾟ weather at night during rush hour I don't know how you don't have someone go outside and read out the names every once in a while and they literally threw me out because I was trying to get in to ask if the order for (insert customers name here) was ready and they said only one person at a time. instead of "whats the name? I'll check, here it is good bye" they say ONLY ONE PERSON GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT.<//text>

They should be more professional and efficient on pick-ups, especially in rush times. Even your order is ready, you have to wait on the line. They take people inside one by one, nobody calls the names for ready orders. It’s too annoying.</review>

My coworkers and I are obsessed with this place. The Hoka special is freaking delicious! And they have a happy hour which comes with 4 California roll or spicy tuna for $11.99. I’ll add more photos next time.</Review>

5 stars for the happy hour deals. 4 stars otherwise. Quick service. Conveniently located near Prospect and Torrance Blvd...food is good. Custom sushi rolls are imaginative and taste great. Make sure you go during their 2 happy hour periods if you can for much better value.< /review>

Great little Sushi place in Redondo Beach. We had the Hoka Hoka too and it was fabu! The teriyaki sauce is really good, and the wait staff is attentive. I only have one complaint: they need more tables! I hope they grow soon! Definitely recommended!!!</Review>

This place has a great lunch and dinner happy hour.  1 roll, 4 pieces of sushi or 4 pieces of California Roll or Spicy Tuna roll for $11.95.  The only negative is ot is so good and the service is so great you are in and out quickly.  Great chefs, service staff and environment.< /Text>

<text>Since we've moved to Torrance, this is our go-to Sushi spot. Staff is friendly and on it! The sushi and house rolls taste amazing and the sashimi is a generous cut. Get there early for happy hour as it does build a crowd quickly.</text>< UserId.>

My husband and I had an excellent lunch here today. Wait staff friendly and attentive. Many thanks and appreciation to the two gentlemen from the kitchen who saw us park and assisted my husband over the curb with his walker. Unfortunately the only two ADA parking spots are nowhere near the restaurant.</Review>

Yummy. I enjoyed my cruclnchy rolls :) and whatever the rest of our group ordered was tasty as I had to try everything :) Friendly staff and good service. If you are going for happy hour sushi make sure you go early enough. Place is very popular and gets very busy.<//text>

A hidden jewel in the South Bay. I am apart off the hospitality industry and quality is a must. From the moment you arrive this eatery holds up to exceptional heights. It's not smoke and mirrors one bite of sushi or sashimi and if you've got a trained pallet you know.... "Eureka!!!" Up beat atmosphere, gracious staff and top flight adult beverages.</review>

Last night was my first time visiting Hoka Hoka. Wow, the happy hour deals here are awesome! It’s a pretty happening sushi joint for a reason. The vibe is great, sushi is excellent and service on par. The Aloha Roll is a must try if you like spicy tuna (very spicy) and albacore! Am definitely going back.< /text>

<Text>This last trip there, my son got food poisening. He threw up all night and was completely miserable he felt sick right after eating there. We all had different sushi rolls so I imagine something he had was tainted.  This is one of our favorite places but unfortunately you just never know about fish sometimes.< /Text><user_name>Jeff Killen</user_name>< pics>

Wow! High speed staff delivered miso and edamame within seconds. Drinks were delivered unbelievably fast as well. The staff certainly earns their keep... The modern look with the up tempo music gave it a fun feel. Food/rolls (rock n roll & Washington rolls) were all on point. Oh did I mention the glass of wine was as big as my girlfriends face ? Overall A+ and a worthy stop<//review>

<Review>Very bad treatment.  The food is great, I paid with my deb/visa card, when they brought my check back my card was not there.  They looked for 15 minutes and never found my credit card.  How could a card be lost in such a small place?  Even my order was wrong to begin with I had to send it back to get it right.  Not trusted.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I was treated very rudely by the staff and lady preparing the orders!  The food I was scheduled to pick up on my app said it was ready.  I entered the restaurant went to the back to collect the order.  The lady preparing it yelled at me stand in the front!  I said ok.  After the scheduled delivery time had expired I asked again if the food was ready?  She tied the bag while throwing the food at me.  I asked please dont tie the bag I need to make sure the order was completely there.  While I was checking the order she grabs the bag out of my hand scratching my arm and throwing me out of her way pushing me out of the restaurant saying I need to leave, I am not doing my job..  So I left and called my boss and got the situation resolved.  Dont be mistreated there are so many other better places to eat here in the South bay!<//text>

Well I'm vegetarian,  so I can't speak on how the fish is here, but... the vegetarian  rolls are good! I got the avocado roll and vegetable tempura roll and they tasted great! I had to ask the sever for the vegetarian selection though, because it's not on the menu. It would be awesome if there were a few vegetarian rolls to choose from on the menu. But thank you for accommodating my diet :)
My fiance and son eat meat and they love the sushi and beef udon.</Review>

Japanese American fusion sushi, hola hola will be filled within 20 minutes of opening most days of the week. The happy hour special which runs for a couple hours each night gives you a good selection of rolls served with 4 pcs of nigiri or a California roll. You get a lot of bang for your buck and can also grab a 22oz japanese/Korean beer or hot sali for 50%off. Servers are always nice and quick, this is a south bay classic.< /Review>

<Review>This is the best sushi in the south bay and some of the best sushi in LA. It is certainly one of the top sushi values in LA. I started going here and you got a special roll, 4 pieces of sushi, miso soup, and a small edamame for $7.99. Now, 5 years later, it's $11.99 and I'm still happy to pay that any day of the week. The chefs are talented and they get some of the freshest fish of anyone around. I've eaten at a lot of local sushi restaurants and they often taste deflated or over-spiced in comparison. My favorite rolls are the Jessica and Ooeeshi rolls, but I look forward to the tuna sushi the most.< /Review>< Resp>

Menu lacks variety. Fish is OK-ish to not so good. Service is border line rude. Even water with no ice is frowned upon. 20 to 40 minutes til you get your order.< /review>

Very reasonable prices, friendly servers. Large, tasty, rolls. $3.95 large Asahi happy hour beer was a bonus.
Salmon and other fish is farmed -(like most sushi resteraunts) otherwise would give 5 stars because the servers are nice and place is friendly.< /Text>

<review>I've been going to Hoka Hoka for 6 or 8 years. It's my favorite sushi restaurant in the South Bay. The rolls are excellent and inexpensive. Make sure you try happy hour.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Great happy hour special! Everyday from 12 - 3 pm and 5 - 7 pm. 1 roll and 5 pieces of sushi with miso soup and edamame for just $9.99. There are plenty of rolls to choose from so I'm sure you will find the perfect one. Plus 50% off beers and sake. My favorite has to be the Double Double. It comes with avocado and salmon on the inside AND avocado and salmon on the outside. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Just as the name suggest, I loved the Ai roll. A nice amount of cream cheese and three types of fish: salmon, tuna, albacore. These are just two of the many great choices available. The decor is nice. It's Japan meets Redondo Beach. They have an awesome lit up sake display on one wall and a GIANT ocean mural on the other. Very cute and very fitting. I loved the giant wine glasses on the ceiling.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I love this place. The sushi melts in your mouth. The happy hour 5-7pm is clearly the major draw, $10 for four nigiri and 6-8 mako (depending on what you ordrer.) There's a choice of about 20 Maki to choose from. It comes with edamame, Miso soup, and a slice of orange for dessert. Best deal in town and good service.<//Text>

Really good, fresh sushi. This is our first visit here, but living walking distance; combined with the excellent, fast, friendly service; I assure you will be back very soon. Mmmmmmm...
Had mostly maki rolls for our first pass. Philly roll... Redondo Beach roll... Spicy maguro maki... sake maki... Hamachi maki... All rolls top notch with wasabi that has a bite missing many other places.</Text>

This place the sushi is so good not rotten all fresh the bathroom is clean nice takeout still the food is freshly made perfect not messy you can take your kids they have 4 ,6 and 12 piece if you want there is a wait but it is worth it.

<Text>A nice place to visit. The story of how it got to this location is fascinating. Of course it started here in the 1850's.

About a hundred years later a man in the Valley, not far from here was creating a western theme park and wanted to have a historic jail. He had it taken apart brick by brick and moved to his new park.

After he died his heirs wanted to sell the property. The new buyer wanted to use it for something else. He notified the county that if we wanted it back we had to get it quickly or it would be bulldozed.

That isn't something that can be done quickly. They put the word out and put a committee together that began raising the money and talent needed.

The county donated the land. A group of people went, took it apart brick by brick and rebuilt it where it is now. Not very far from where it was 150 years earlier.

I know that I made it sound easy. It wasn't. There were many fundraising problems, several times it seemed like it wouldn't happen. Then the brain power and labor that understood and was willing to defer to the architect and historians. Maybe you're beginning to understand that there are many people to thank for it being here.<//Text>< Pics>

We actually came here for a reptile...and we left with a bunny! The reptiles were kept very cleanly and neatly but the baby bunnies just melted our hearts. Overall a great experience, they don't care if you adopt a feeder rabbit for a pet lol! Also included is a pic of the rabbits and a beautiful carpet python!<//Review>

Well I thought it would be bigger with more selections. Bought my daughter a snapping turtle, to keep her busy since kids aren't in school right now. She's loving in great turtle.< /text>

I've been coming here for about 10 years and the service here is always outstanding. I was recently put in a temporary situation where my snakes weren't invited so they have been housing them for me till I can take them back.  Prices were the absolute best within 50 miles for housing and they are taking great care of them. I'm so beyond grateful for this place<//Review>

The lady there was very polite, helped answer questions and did her best to help us in every way. They have adult Dubias, Hissing Roaches, etc. for our bearded dragon, and with them actually selling adults we can potentially start a colony of them with her help.< /review>

I got a tortoise here about a year ago and he was very healthy. He still is to this day with no health problems! They seem to know info about their pets. The bedding is always clean, no poop on it. I always see fresh food too. They pet sit VERY good and take very good care of your pet.  I would highly recommend this place. <3<//Review>

I came across this place out of desperation on my bp second feed . Luckily for a newb like me the woman at the counter was  very informative on things I needed to know .... Now I go weekly  and visit the cool reptiles that are their . If you happen to stop by check out their awesome collection of bp and lively bearded dragons.👌<//text>

Worst place ever  the girl that’s always there is always smoking and  being rude and the animals are all practically dead!, the lady is not helpful at all if she wants customers to be loyal she has to remember who we are and not charge us two times!
U pay way to much for snake food and she dosent even show I the rat before u buy it or let u choose it ., worst place ever never going back and I don’t recommended for anyone! Find a better place to spend your money on!<//review>

<text>I would give them a 5 but most of the time I go in the shop to get feeder rats they are almost always out...so be sure to call ahead. Otherwise they have a great selection of reptiles and amphibians and they keep them very healthy.

Great place to get my beardie some worms and other gear. You get much more worms at a much cheaper price, plus they are always fresh and look a lot better than other pet stores.<//text>

Great customer service, a bit high on the prices for animals but the husbandry is wonderful. They are decently knowledgeable on what animals they carry. Very clean and friendly. My new go to place for my snake needs. He said they will be  carrying frozen rodents soon as well.<//text>

Best reptile store in the area. Staff is friendly, they know what they are talking about, and all the animals are healthy. This place left such a good impression after I bought my ball python from them, that I now only get my feeder rats from them. The place is clean, and organized, and the selection of different reptiles is great.<//Review>

<text>Go to LLL! Jesus these people didn't look like they knew anything reptile related! Looked so promising and cool but oh lord was it empty, animals looked like they were having heart attacks. Lizard on paper towels with no coverage from the heat. Leopard geckos on sand went that's not okay for them! Cages left open and dirty, turtles were in childs reach with no coverage. Pathetic! Go to Petco that's even better than this.</text>< Pics>

<Review>This year I have been a new snake owner, I have been coming regularly to pick up rats and the staff have been a huge help in answering questions of mine. My baby snake has grown to a nice healthy happy size and thanks to smart feeding tips and advice she's health, happy, and never associated my hand with feeding times.</Review><date>1461308682775< /date></record></dataset><record>

Great experience as a new patient with Dr. Rogers. She was professional, knowledgeable, honest, and personable. She already reviewed my file and reasons for the visit which made our discussion more effective in providing the best treatment option available for me.
The staff was helpful and friendly.  I highly recommend Dr. Rogers!<//review>

Dr. Rogers is an outstanding urologist.  She has been helping me for several years with aging issues and bladder. She researches the best way to problem solve,  She helps train her patients with various devices.  She communicates clearly, and is very kind.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>The surgery center was welcoming and procedures were explained and questions answered clearly.  Throughout my experience, I was made to feel very well cared for.  I could see how busy the Dr. Rogers and her team were, yet I felt as if I was their biggest concern.  The procedure was over quickly and I appreciated the light anesthetic; I was actually able to walk back to my recovery bed unassisted.  Overall recovery went very well with no side effects; I was home the same day. The procedure has been effective in stopping my stress incontinence.  I would recommend the bulking agent procedure to anyone with this issue.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e91530d9776edb:0xe9d1d343031a2d3c<//Gmap_id></record>

I’m so pleased with my results after I received my Bulkamid Bulking Agent. I literally have no problem now with stress urinary incontinence. No more problems during exercising, coughing and other activities. Dr. Rodgers did a great job finding the right procedure for me. I’m very pleased.< /review>

Dr. Rogers got me from the first when I became a patient.  She listened to me and then remembered the next time I saw her.  I was very impressed with her insight, skill, and caring attitude!  I am fortunate to be able to go to her as my doc. I trust her advice very strongly, but she always listens to me and lets me have the final say if optional.< /Review>

Dr. Rogers is by far one of the best providers I've ever had. Extremely personable, easy to talk to, very professional and knows her stuff! I love her energy and enthusiasm. She obviously loves what she does and is really good at it. I wish all my providers were more like Dr. Rogers.<//review>

A bit faster than I expected for a routine checkup, less than 5 minutes, but I suppose all the bases were covered so to speak. Definitely a top quality doctor.<//Text>

I have visited with Dr. Roger several times, the first time 1 year ago.  I have chronic UTI’s after years of antibiotics barely 6 weeks apart I decided to see a different Dr.  Dr. Roger suggested no more antibiotics since they are not helping or alleviating the problem.  I have never heard a Dr. suggesting to not take antibiotics I am so glad she did!! Dr. Rogers is supportive in my way of a more natural approach to making the best of a not great situation!! I love her and she is so easy to talk to!  I can not say enough good things about her!! Antibiotics are not the best remedy they destroy a lot of needed natural microbes in your body!< /text>

I had 10 years worth of very bad bladder infections since I had a sling installed. I had been on antibiotics for years and my infections were multiple times a month. My GP had said I would be on antibiotics the rest of my life and recommended I just take an antibiotic daily. Dr. Rogers recommended stopping taking the antibiotics and rub on a pea-sized drop of estrogen cream twice-weekly and fully empty my bladder before bed and several times a day. My infections been completely gone for a year and a half.< /text>

<Text>Having gone through what I have with always going to the bathroom. Getting the Axonics put in has made a world of difference. I feel more myself now and I’m not rushing to the restroom. I highly recommend having the Axonics put in!!! It has helped me greatly.
Thanks to Dr Rodgers and her team!!

I did not believe that was a good  choice for me, as I felt the recovery was quiet long, and the possibility of something going wrong down the line could happen, as
with all surgeries...There was also the dreaded pad!
Dr Rogers introduced me to a procedure called Bulkamid, it’s a gel like substance(97.5% water, 2.5% polyacrylamide) that is placed on your urethral wall to “bulk up”, hence no more embarrassing leaking, when sneezing, coughing , jumping or running.You are put under sedation by her great team in the OR, the procedure probably only takes 30 minutes, and you are out of Sansum Surgery Center in less than 3 hours. I highly recommend this procedure to all women with the same issues as I had!
Dr Rogers is super easy to communicate with, she made me feel comfortable ,talking about something uncomfortable and slighty embarrassing (to me)
And her choice of sneakers is always on trend🤩

My husband and I have lived here for about 3 months and we absolutely love it!! The area is well maintained and quiet. Everyone in the leasing center are super friendly and helpful! I wanted new blinds for the windows in our loft and the maintenance staff custom ordered it and put it up within a week (due to delivery time of the blinds). We love living here and to call this place home!< /Text>

I've been living here for a week now and so far I liked everything, but another important thing to mention is that everyone I met and who have been living here for a year and more, tell only good things about this community. I'd like to mention the great residential service team here and guys in the leasing office, they are the best especially Stephany which helped us to find the perfect new home here, I would say she was the one who helped us make this decision and I really appreciate it and Shery which assisted with the move and also was super friendly and kind. But you can be sure that all the guys here will help you with everything you need. I highly recommend this community at least you need to visit it to see everything with my own eyes.</Text>

<Review>I lived in this complex for almost 5 years and I absolutely loved living here. They have always made every transition we made, from down sizing from a 2 bedroom to a one bedroom or simply moving out, such an easy experience. Every step of the way there has always been open lines of communication. Kendra has always been exceptional and so informative. I will definitely miss not being here anymore.<//Review>< pics>

<review>If you’re looking for a well-maintained apartment community, (located within 15 to 30 minutes of just about everything San Diego has to offer), at an affordable price, then look no further than Arcadia at Stonecrest Village located about 1.2 miles from the I-15 and Aero Drive intersect. My family lived there from Feb. 2016 to March 2017 and moved out because we purchased a home. We commend the entire Arcadia at Stonecrest Village team for being consummate professionals and upholding the “Love Where You Live” mindset, which is evident at every turn in this community. The entire staff works hard day-in and-out to take care of resident needs and in maintaining the grounds and common areas. In San Diego, it is hard to get away from the highway noise, and it is no different at Arcadia at Stonecrest Village. We were fortunate to live on the third floor directly above the swimming pool/Jacuzzi, barbecue gas grills, fitness center and leasing office, and enjoyed being centrally located within this community. Our family would recommend Arcadia at Stonecrest Village to anyone looking for a quality place to live. If you are living on a budget, our family of three spent about $75 monthly on SDG&E and $70 monthly on ConService (water/sewage/refuge); however, we only used our HVAC about 5 days out of the 13 months we lived in our apartment.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORixbagYrvsmQhq_8wYqaaqrpCvQ98jOVhMXS-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGf0BSK7-ni9tb4Oq74WraLMNfaPDBZF6ZsIQ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLj0-aIxy0UT3dz7H-A8L69sbndCa0cPTUiHJx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsSAaSd3ZaNFMHsLhb23yqy23a2uaXBu_8_Dea=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTJak9f3ZpJBu8P7_XGxuVRS8SH84k67YO8zG4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>If I can rate this place a zero Star for safety, I would. There is vehicle theft and management won't do anything besides suggesting to call police or car insurance. There could be other safety measures put in place but management is not concerned because their vehicles are not being broken into. They try to make this place appear a safe community but it's not. The police is often in the complex. Save your money and property, stay away from this complex.<//Review>< pictures>

My favorite apartment I've ever lived in! Not only was the apartment we stayed in beautiful and spacious for our family, the staff was absolutely the best. They were so friendly and adorable with my toddler, we couldn't of asked for a better place to call home!</text>

I’m a very easy going person, but I felt the need to write here because I feel some small re-considerations could make a big difference.

As far as the complex goes, the landscaping crews are here every day around 7am making all kinds of noise. Whether you live in an apartment or not I think we can all agree 7am is not the most appropriate time to be running machines & tools. The garbage/recycling, which seems to come in and do one dumpster at a time, are here at least 3 times a day, 7 days a week. If you don’t work first shift, I wish you luck getting any sleep. The neighborhood is a great family environment, but you will likely hear screaming kids all day long, especially if you have an apt that looks at the HOA pool.

In response to COVID, we had reached out to express our concerns about being away from our families being that we are not from California. We were met with a response that was just as I expected - please pay us over an absurd amount of money and we’d be happy to let you leave. I get that you can’t do favors for everyone, but a show of real empathy and willingness to at least discuss the situation would've gone a long way, ESPECIALLY because we are being charged us for things we can’t even use because of the pandemic (the gym, clubhouse, pool).

Like I said, a few small changes could go a long way because this place does have a lot going for it, but Irvine Company is a huge company and it’s just disappointing that everything becomes centered around your money in the end.< /Text>

My husband and I moved here two years ago after selling our house in San Diego. We did an extensive review of numerous properties and chose to lease here at Arcadia while we built our retirement home out of state. Everyone in the leasing office has been wonderful and always helpful including Neil, Kendra, Brianne and Shali. Gustavo and Jesus have been the lead maintenance crew for years and are professional, courtesy and quick to fix anything requested. We have found the community to be a hidden gem in San Diego with freeway convenience and an overall safe neighborhood. Great 2 mile round trip canyon trail out the back gate that is dog friendly as is the complex.<//review>

I have been living here for over two years. Our first apartment was on the third floor and hardly had any issues. We moved to the first floor after our lease was up for convenience. The location/area is great. I chose this place for location, garage option and amenities. The experience was great until we moved to the first level apartment. If you want to sleep, do not get an apartment on first and second level. The person above us walks like they’re stomping on every step they take. You can hear every step including when they flush the toilet. Management has not been able to resolve the issue and after several conversations of email/phone with the manager, the only solution is for us to PAY to move to a different apartment because they will not lose any money.  I had one email attempt to the assistant manager who said, “We kindly ask that all residents please note that apartment home living does come with some noise.” So noise at 4 a.m and 5a.m on weekends and weekdays is fine and say goodbye to your sleep if the person above you “walks hard” because there is nothing management can do to solve this issue.
If you live around the greenery, you’ll have a lot of spiders in your apartment.

Update 10/19/20: four months later, NONE. I was never contacted by management. I have sent various emails with the same complaint, no response. I also sent an e-mail reporting there was theft in our vehicle and no response. I had to go in the office to report vehicle theft and only response was to call police. No cameras around complex and “security” is doing their job. No effort to warn other residents or to ask if anybody saw anything. Save your money and stay away from this complex.<//text>

If you're looking for a quiet, safe, well maintained home that also has easy access to all that San Diego has to offer... Arcadia at Stonecrest is that perfect location!
My husband and I have lived here for over 5 years and have been completely satisfied with our experience at this beautiful complex. The office staff are always welcoming and positive, any concerns are always resolved quickly and effectively. The maintenance staff are equally friendly and responsive, and are available 7 days a week! Arcadia at Stonecrest has well maintained buildings and grounds with a pool, fitness center, and community grills that are always clean and available. The apartment homes are spacious with great appliances and storage, with large windows for natural light. Additionally both the complex and the surrounding neighborhood are very pleasant and safe... you literally can walk the community at all hours.  We love living here!<//review>

<review>I’ve lived here coming up on a year now and it was time to renew my lease so needless to say that without any hesitation I did. I absolutely love it here. It’s clean, quiet, and the price is incredibly reasonable for the location. The staff are all incredibly wonderful from the maintenance and upkeep personnel, to the leasing office agents especially Neil. We worked with him prior to moving in and he was awesome helping us look around and settling on what floor plan we wanted. He’s kept up with us to make sure all is in order even after being here for a year. I would highly recommend living here if you’re looking for a reasonably priced apartment in Mission Valley.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>Been here for quite some months, and despite the fact that there are some issues with the community, I was planning to renew my lease, but today after having a very unpleasant conversation with the staff, I m gonna seriously reconsider. This community staff doesn't care about the tenants at all. The fact that they are not willing to make any adjustments according to the unfortunate COVID-19 situation is really a surprise to me!!

It all started with this unfortunate COVID-19 situation, the battery on my car drained out. For the sake of less contact and stay healthy, I ve decided to get it fixed right after the COVID issue is over.

Yet, NO, the leasing office demanded me to fix my car ASAP and moved to a different parking spot. What it the POINT of that??? During this unfortunate crisis with no consideration of my personal safety!!

Well, I guess it just reveals that this community is lack of parking spots that they demand ppl to move regularly even with a valid permit.

My car has a valid permit on it and I parked on a open parking spot. Yet they showed me no respect or sympathy, and DEMAND me to get my car cleaned and moved. And they threatened to tow my car if I don't do what they asked.

If the leasing office do care about the cleanliness of the community, I would suggest you clean up the trash area first, it is literally a DUMP. Guess what, when they show you around the community, they won't show you where to dump the trash, which is disgusting.

I M SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PLACE. I pay my rent on time. I respect my neighbors and never made loud noises. Do I really deserve this???

I m gonna fix my car disregard the HEALTH SAFETY concerns, if that is what it takes to make the community staff satisfied.

Yet I m never coming back to this community again after my leasing end.

You might ask Why don't I move right now? It takes freakin 2mos rent to break the lease earlier. That is how unreasonable the leasing office is :)</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>We’ve been living here for a quite sometime. If not for the location, we could have moved long time ago. It was just so convenient to us since we work just up the hill.
When we first moved here, the management here WERE all nice, helpful and friendly !!! Parking spaces were adequate and quiet. These are the old qualities Arcadia USED to have.... Before, all the nice and competent staff left !
Now, chaos !!!! People are forced to park on the streets... Why?!? Because, management allowed garages to be used as storage!!!!  No more random garage checking. And management just turned blind and deaf to all the residents complains regarding parking. Management tells you, we’re working on it , we’re issuing tickets , blah, blah, blah !!!!! All excuses !!! No results !!! There’s a lot of garages that are full of appliances, trash, boxes and mind you, one of them was turned into a gym !!!! Wow !!! Just Wow !!! With these parking situation, if you are so unlucky enough, you are forced to park on the streets and walk a distance just because street parking are full too... on these cold and rainy San Diego nights!!!! Amazing !!!!!</Review><GmapID>0x80d9559ac1eef687:0x9a08b7422dafe2d4</GmapID><Date>1550871754588<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Arcadia at Stonecrest Village

Moments after turning down West Canyon Avenue, you begin to realize that you’re not in a typical, mixed-zone sector of San Diego anymore. The drive is tranquil, aloft with greenery that gently gives way to the sun-dappled street below. It reminds me of Springtime in Connecticut where trees lining every road are less of a stereotype, and more of an enduring architecture. Brick and cobblestone lay path through cross-streets, embroidering each community of homes. On approach to our neighborhood, amid the road’s end roundabout, park benches encircle a great pine that can be seen adorned in lights for the holidays.

Arcadia. I’ve had the pleasure of living in this small community for over a year now and I hate to think of what a demotion it would be should I ever have to relocate elsewhere. It is unlike any other I’ve seen. From the charm of its kith-and-kin, to the quaintness in feeling both nostalgic and new, Arcadia is the first place since moving to California six years ago that I’ve felt at home. The complex’s color arrangement is imbued with earth tones and creams, creating a calming environment throughout. The pool is warm throughout the year, lined with gas-burning grills in small, festivity-ready alcoves. The whir of a single road sings in the background as if it were the waves of the ocean climbing the beach.

My apartment itself is bright and spacious with a treehouse sort of feel to it, due to the nearby plants that form a gently-swaying buffer from the world apart. Did I mention the various food trucks that grace us with their presence a few times a month? I sometimes daydream of becoming agoraphobic and just not ever leaving my little cradle of luxury here, but I suppose that I’ll just have to keep wading through the muck of life. At least where I live invokes only uplifting feelings, especially when coming home from those long... long days at work.

I truly know Stonecrest Village to be one of San Diego’s best kept secrets, and to be perfectly honest... I’d rather it remain as such for our residents to continue enjoying year after year.</Text>< Pics>

Been here about 7 months,  absolutely no complaints.  Quiet, clean, just perfect.
(Maybe put more signs saying to pick up after your dog? Only so much management can do, but theres quite a few people who don't pick up after their small dogs, im guessing because their small they think its not a big deal. Oh well) 5 stars!</review>

(Translated by Google) Nice neighborhood and very quiet. The security is also good. Property services are also good. No money is not spent!

Good rates, but bring your own tape measure. Had a discrepancy over over 14 square feet and was told "tough luck deal with it". Facility is clean for the most part, I saw a dog piss on a parking column. Don't expect covid safety to be enforced, people going into the elevators without a care.< /text>

La self storage in los angeles has great, helpful employees. Joe P is the manager there and he keeps the storage facility there clean and organized. Lily in the front office is always willing to lend a helping hand. I highly recommend this business.</text>

This storage facility is clean and well organized and management is friendly. Parking is available and the office is in the garage. I rented a unit there for about a year and I recommend this facility if you are looking for a reasonablely priced storage. During move-in you have access to a moving truck. Check with management when you call.</text>

Pros: Clean facility, good value, security, and very very friendly staff

Facility has external gates that are only open during storage hours followed by gates and security locked elevators- you are given a code and you can only access your floor.

Staff are very friendly and willing to help in any way possible. I can't say enough good things about them- if you need a storage, stop by and see it for yourself. Joe is great!

Value: their pricing i believe is on par with the market rate, they do offer specials so it doesn't hurt to ask. But with all that you get, I think this place is worth it.

Con: can't think of any

Overall, when I was searching for a storage, I called around for rates and availability. There were some that were nationally ran where the call center was in some other state and their sole goal was to make the sales. When I called Los Angeles Self Storage, someone actually picked up the call, gave me the breakdown, provided me with directions and when I got there, they walked around to show me the storage itself. Everything went very smoothly and on-site staff were on point with their customer service.  All this was actually at a lower monthly rate than other places I called. So, they definitely earn 5 stars and I hope you will check it out for yourself!</text>

I just completed a move to LA Self Storage and had a great experience! This was my first time doing storage ever so I naturally had a lot of questions but Tony was extremely patient with addressing my concerns as well as showing me different options. I highly recommend LA Self Storage - ask for Tony!<//review>

I am very impressed with this storage facility.  It is clean, has easy access from car to unit.  Joe the manager & Otto give expert & friendly help.  Great prices for a city storage facility.  Good location for Los Angeles City area.  It feels safe to me, with their use of codes & the layout.  There is lots of parking & plenty trolleys .  In my estimation, they are simply really good at what they do, down to the details.  I am happy that I came to this place.  They get 5 stars +.< /review>

Really well run storage facility. I like that you have to punch in a code so it will only take you to your floor of your storage. We have had issues when our card on file expires or the bank issues a new one and they have always been great at handling that as well.<//Review>

I have been a customer of Los Angeles self storage for the past four years I believe. The manager Joe as well as the entire staff are extremely professional understanding and compassionate people who understand the needs of their customers I would highly recommend anyone to come to the storage unit and know that your stuff would be safe and secure. If I could give more than five stars I would.</Text>

<text>I called other storage facilities in LA before renting a space here. They were dishonest and unreliable. I found LA Storage to be the lowest price while offering the best customer service. I am particularly impressed with Joe, the site manager. If you are looking for a safe, clean, fair priced storage, look no further.<//text>< Pics>

we have a few storages in this building and one of them is the biggest one they have, approximately 2862 sq ft which is really great. we have been storing there for over 4 years now. we need to go in and out a lot of times due to the nature of our business and it works perfect for us as the units have very easy access. they people working there are also very accommodating. i wonder ld highly recommend this place.<//review>

After surgery on my eye my wife asked me what I wanted to eat for a treat. I had already been dreaming of a Togo’s #9 so we stopped in. I don’t do a #9 very often because it’s not all that healthy. I was really disappointed this time. I always order it with mustard and pickles only, no lettuce, tomato or anything else but meat.

This sandwich had about 1/2 as much pastrami as I’m accustomed. I don’t think she weighed the pastrami as I’ve seen before. Maybe it was just a “one off”. Since we ordered to go at Togo’s we didn’t go back to ask if this was the new normal. I was very disappointed.</Review>< name>

<Review>Good service over all. But noticed the cold roast beef had more meat than my hot.  I  thought about it and came up with the hot roast beef is heated in juices witch made it weigh more thus less actual meat.  Still a  good sandwich.<//Review>< Pictures>

Have ordered online 4 times in past 2 months. 3 of the 4 times my order was wrong. They argued I ordered it wrong but I showed the online confirmation and I ordered correctly. It's ridiculous and they are wasting food and my time.
Staff in CV is not very friendly either. Jennifer was always great but never see her anymore.<//text>

Called ahead. 30 minutes. Get there 30 minutes later and the order wasn't started. Took an additional 15 min to make 3 sandwiches. They messed up in the size of one of the sandwiches and had to remake. The sandwich maker tells who I'm assuming is the owner can you ring them up fast because they aren't happy. No big apology. No offer of not charging for cheese or something. Just rude. Paid $35 for 3 mediocre sandwiches. I will not be returning. I'll go to Quiznos across the street.</Review>

Horrible service

People aren't wearing face masks while preparing the food.  We ordered the food 30 mins ahead and when we got here they didn't even know what we were talking about. We had to wait again in the lobby. Needs new management/owners. Never going back again.< /text>

Lately they have been very inconsistent. 1) they never have the pastrami ready and you have to wait while some is heated up 2) Sometimes your sandwich is almost too sloppy (too much mayo/mustard) or next time it is way too dry.  Still get a craving and will go when I do. I just hope they have their act together!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Lots of meat on the tasty sandwiches. A bit $$ for a sandwich shop though but good selection.< /review>

Their number 24 was my most favorite sandwich, for years.  But my friends Togo’s has really changed.

It is my feeling that they made their French rolls so THICK to fool us into thinking We are getting
A nice big sandwich with lots of meat.  When all we are getting is more bread.  I am so disappointed!
It only is there more bread......there is less meat!  Shame on you....

Due to the high cost, Togo’s was a treat for me, but not anymore!< /review></record>

The one i went to had an annoying person making my sandwich. Spent more time playing with the food than making the sandwich. To add to that they messed up my order as well as another person's. What could have been a 10 min sandwich stop, turned into 30 mins of a sloppy experience.</Text>

Very unprofessional.  Talks s#!+ about customers in Spanish thinking they don't understand what she's saying. Because she couldn't do her job right, she got mad. Poor quality of cleaning and detailing. Waste of money. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL! Go somewhere else!</Text>

Paid $250 and tipped $50 for exterior wash, rinse, dry, wax. The end result was mediocre at best, my rims looked like a child tried cleaning them. If I paid $50, I would've expected a result like I got--this definitely wasn't a $300 service.<//Text>

First time using this business. They did a great job. Hand washed and dried my truck which is very large. Took the time and extra care to ensure windows did not have streaks. I will definitely go back.< /review>

< review>
had my new car detailed waited inside the office. Upon completion I paid the work done including extra for floor mats Upon opening the drivers door I seen the floor mat was still untouched , I further checked the interior  found the interior pretty much untouched. I brought it to the attention of the new owner. After another fifteen minutes I entered the car  found it was not cleaned as it should be ,especially the floor mats. I finished cleaning the car at home NEVER RETURNED AGAIN<//review>

This is my 2nd time here now and im so impressed with their customer service and their work ethic. My mom and sister didnt have extra money on them for a drink and were thirsty so she offered them a drink on her . They clean my car really well when i come here. Very efficient and all by hand. Impressive work .< /text>

If I could give them no stars I would. Went to red bluff car wash today, and they did a horrible job. I went back to show them, and give them another chance they told me they scrubbed it, and did a good job. I showed them 6 places missed that were easily visible. They gave me attitude, so I asked for my money back. They took pictures of my car, and told me they were going to report me to the BBB I said go on right ahead I’ll do the same. If you want to have your car done right, and nice don’t go there. I could of got that same job at a gas station car wash.< /Review>

<Text>They are usually very good, very thorough... but, then, I always make sure to be one of their first customers of the day.  They are always much more ready to go first thing in the morning... I can't speak to their quality as the day wears on as I refuse to wait 50+ minutes to have my car washed...<//Text>< pics>

Worse job yet! I paid for a wash inside & out with the wax. They didn't even clean/dust the whole right side of the dashboard! I go there because I am disabled.  I don't demand perfection but I at least want the basics! Even the windshield wasn't clean. So I guess they just waxed over the bugs! I Going to look into options for a different car detail place. I may have to get my car washed when I go to Redding. I have put up with their not so great work but after today I'm fed up!<//text>

They did not let us know we were supposed to stand by our car until they came to us and then reprimanded us because we couldn't read their mind. We got a wash and vacuum and the first thing I noticed when we got back to leave was grass and debre on the carpet by the doors. Would not recommend them and will not go back.</Text>

Stopped by late one afternoon hoping to get the inside cleaned up.  I was a little hesitant due to the reviews I had read.  However, I found they were accommodating and did a nice job.  I will return.</review>

One star is to generous for this place l took my pick up in for a detail impressing on the man at the counter that the inside was FAR more important then the outside. They had my vehicle from 920 until 445 and failed to get the enterior satisfactorly clean. Sure they smeared armoral or some sort of stuff all over and attempted to vacume it maybe, maybe didnt shampoo it if there was a place for pictures l would have posted proof of the VERRY UNSATISFACTORY ATTEMPT at cleaning my vehicle< /review>

Well after lunch time, (almost 130) still not opened after lunch.  Workers standing around.  The two said it would be another 45 minutes before they could wash my car.</Review>

They do a good job cleaning the car, but it is slow. We dropped off our car then walked to Tremont for breakfast where service seemed slow, ate breakfast then walked back and our car was being vacuumed out. We waited five more minutes the it was done. If I had waited all that time I would have been very frustrated.</Review>

I love the way my hair turned out!! I only got a haircut but it was much needed after about a year of not cutting it! So it was still quite a bit of work but she did a wonderful job. Didn't take off too much, made sure she understood what I wanted, knowledgeable on salon products - but didn't push a sale! It was just a great experience overall ☺️ i highly recommend supporting this family run business. I got my haircut in September 2020. My sister also enjoyed her haircut too btw :)< /Review>

Arcadia is a lovely person and a gifted hair artist! She got me in right away when SC County opened salons last month and she performed magic on my unruly hair in need of color. I highly recommend her and the other hair dressers in her salon!</text>

I came to the salon in hopes of getting my hair styled for a wedding. I ended up leaving with a gorgeous style and amazing makeup. Taylor is absolutely amazing and I would recommend her to anyone. I have never felt more beautiful and confident in myself and I owe it all to her!
Aside from that, all the ladies at Arcadia were so nice and welcoming! Five stars for all of you hard working women!< /review>

Lily at Arcadia has been cutting my hair for a couple of years now.  She's always friendly and in a good mood, as are her mom (Arcadia) and the other folks there.  Very much a family place (great for mom, dad, the kids, grandparents)  They get to know you and what you want and really do a great job for a reasonable price.</review>

<Text>I was new to the area and looking for a quality hair salon at a reasonable price. I have been to Arcadia twice and not been disappointed! All of the stylists are talented and sincere--the place is very comfortable, overall a great experience. Amazing quality hair cuts for the price--especially in this area!

I’ve been looking for a hair salon for awhile since I moved here and I am so happy that I found Arcadia! Lilly and her mom are so nice and they do such a good job! I wanted to get bangs but was scared to look like a 5 year old lol but they did better than I hoped! Love this place! Recommend to all my friends! Also their price is super reasonable!<//Review>

I've been a loyal customer of Arcadia's Hair Salon for several years now. Veronica, my hair stylist, is very professional, courteous, and meticulous in her work. The salon uses the finest products, too. I love the entire entourage of stylists who work at Arcadia's, and the salon has such a great vibe and energy. These stylists are professionals of the highest caliber, yet at the same time they are very down-to-earth and treat their customers like family. I always feel genuinely welcome and leave immensely satisfied with the way my hair looks. I highly recommend this salon!< /review>

I highly recommend this salon and their skills in cutting hair!!! I went in to get my long hair made into a bob and fell in love with my results and how my needs were tended to. Arcadia was very wise and chose a cut that was ideal to the shape of my face!!!<//Text>

Arcadia, the owner of the salon, did my hair. I told her that I wanted to start with cutting off an inch or two. She told me that if she cut that much and then cut it again it would cost more because it’s technically two separate haircuts  which didn’t make sense to me. I just wanted to see what my hair would look like with that much cut off and see if I wanted more. Then I told her I wanted to frame my face but I didn’t want bangs. And guess what? She gave me bangs. The front part of my hair was shorter than the bottom of my chin. And she ended up texturizing my hair and giving me layers which I did not even remotely ask for. It literally looks like a four year old cut my hair. It is so choppy and the front part of my hair is completely cut to my chin and the rest is below the shoulders. It looks nasty. I don’t know how to get it fixed or if I can even get it fixed because it is so short. Not to mention, during my hair cut, Arcadia would literally leave for five minutes TWICE to go talk to someone, IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING MY HAIRCUT. She kept telling me that she knew what she was doing and that she has been a hairstylist for a long time. (Doesn’t look like it) She forced her opinion of how she wanted my hair to look on me instead of listening to what I said I wanted. At the end of the haircut she literally told me that she thought she did a great job. She was complimenting herself! I came back in and Lilly tried to fix it (she was better at listening to what I wanted) but it still looks horrible. I’m sorry for this long review but after paying for a bad haircut, I had to say something.</review></record>

So I am writing this review just coz I just got my hair done for the first time here in this place and I walked out very satisfied and happy with the outcome .. the owner who is very knowledgeable about hair colors and even showed guidelines on h ow to not ruin your hair :)  she then introduce me to her daughter who also works there and did a tremendous job with my hair ( lighter on top , red on the bottom I lav it lol ) the whole time I was there , they were very friendly and gave me the feeling at home vibes.. I will definitely start coming here and let Lily take care of my hair from now on moving forward ...  this place is highly recommended .. 2 thumbs up< /Text>

We typically remember our clients and none of us can remember you. Your review leaves no information to confirm that you ever used our services, and we have had no client complaints so cannot match your review up with any particular issue that we can resolve.\n\nOur reviews from actual clients are all 4 or 5 stars and that trend of high ratings has been steady over the years. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethics both inside and outside the our hair salon, which is why this startling review is in stark contrast to every other review about us on Google, Yelp or Facebook.\n\nKindly reach out and contact us if you believe you were our client, and we would very much like to be given an opportunity to address your concerns and remedy them.\n\nThank you'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Date>1494785243564</Date><text>This place is horrible!!! I was a walk in and asked them to see if they could do an ombré! First of all, no one was in there getting their hair done I immediately was hestitant after that. In addition the workers were all laying around on the couches talking. When I asked the owner what she could do and how much it would cost she kept just saying how this is one of the best salons and that's why they charge alittle more but in addition she was saying my hair was unable to work with.(really they were just lazy and didn't want to get up and actually do my hair) so I left and went to Andreas hair salon and they did an AMAZING job! It was exactly what I wanted!! I recommend andreas hair salon over this horrible place!!< /text></record>

<review>My experience at Arcadia Hair Salon was great and the best I've had since I moved to Santa Cruz from San Diego 5 years ago. The ladies there were very professional and fast, considering that I called in just an hour ahead without any prior appointment and they were able to help me right away. I went in not knowing what to do to my already blonde hair and they sat me down and took care of it. Vero added some very nice highlights and fixed my my ugly orangy blonde. In addition she did a reconstruction treatment for my damaged hair and trimmend my split ends without removing too many inches off my hair. Afterwards she styled it into really nice curls. They took very good care of me and my hair and have earned my trust. There isn't any other place I would recommend plus they have adequate and reasonable prices for the quality service they provide, unlike many places I have been to in Santa Cruz that have overcharged services that are not even that great. Thank you so much Vero!< /review></record>

<text>Very helpful with father and son project.   We did a full strip down of a 1973 standard beetle to just the shell and replaced everything from the wiring, built a new dual carb 1776, add 4 wheel disc brakes, transmission, interior, paint, etc.  Now, he drives it to work and school and love it. Thanks for all the help.</text>< response>

Patrick enjoys sticking it to the customer when he can
So sad  it was a great business when Steve ran it. No customer respect any longer. Hope they are able to stay in business. I get better service and prices from others off the internet.
Haven't been back in over a year. Have bought over $2,000 on line so far and never have had a problem

This place has gone down hill. Purchased a 6v battery for my 5 year project and the battery completely dead!. Battery has almost no water, for $150 maybe someone should check.< /Review>

I shopped at Bill and Steve's way back when they were on Alondra in Bellflower and always had a good experience.  When the store moved to Downey - I was out of the hobby for a while but I would periodically stop in and buy a few parts and chat with the employees if it wasn't busy.

After Steve sold the business, I was back in town for a brief time and visited the store during the week in the middle of the day - I was the only customer in the store at the time.  The new owner, Patrick, was very condescending - he was both 'too smart' and 'too busy' to engage in conversation about anything not of interest to him.  He didn't seem to care about anything I was saying and talked over me at one point - that's when I decided that it was time to leave.<//Review>

They are not offering what their menu shows online.  They have a small menu due to Covid.  The omelet I ordered was not good.  They mixed flavors that should never be together.  I still gag thinking about it.  The service was spotty as we never received our drinks and a side was brought too late.

Limited menu right now but my frittata, potatoes, and toast were exceptional as I had hoped they would still be. Check hours/days before you go.< /Text>

<Review>Haven't been there forever but one of the best breakfast joints ever.  Tiny space, there used to often be a line, the guy coming makes everything... Bread, juice, pancakes, eggs... Amazing! If you're into breakfast food, the line, if one is there, is well worth the wait.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Great little eatery in SF. We went for breakfast and had mixed reviews on their dishes (hence the 4 star). Staff was perfectly kind and on top of everything. We were seated immediately and walked through the menu. Tons of seasonal options and varying menu choices.

I ordered the famous pancakes and simple breakfast with eggs, bacon and potatoes. Right from the set down, the potatoes were awesome. They loaded me up on bacon which was nice but I couldn't finish it all. The pancakes were made with buck-wheat, ginger, and cinnamon and it was unlike any pancake I've ever had! I loved it!

We also ordered gluten-free pancakes but they weren't half as good. They were bland with little flavor. On top of that, slightly burnt. Our waiter did remove some of the fee with the gf pancakes. I'd definitely go back to try some more from here!

Note: I'm not very familiar with SF, but throughout our stay it seemed like we saw the most homelessness on this street... Making getting to and from the restaurant a quickly desired act.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Online menu is not current.  I was going to give a 2 star until we got the food and I increased it 3.5 stars.  Using an extremely basic menu with NO gluten free options listed online.  Weird vibe although building is beautiful.< /Text><username>dl mcd</username>< user>

Pricy popular brunch place. I had the pancakes. They're good. But honestly you can get better pancakes for a lot less at Mo'z cafe.< /Text>

I used to bring people from out of town if they are spending enough time here using this place as part if a relatively complex /elaborate assault on the part of the personality that gets them to become impressed!<//review>

<text>I used to have pastries here frequently and they were always very good. They've reopened since closing for a while during the pandemic and they're now (as of April '21) doing indoor dining, though with a limited menu.

Pros: rooftop dining, attentive & friendly waitstaff, decent omelette (once salted), pico de gallo

Cons: where did the delicious pastries go?, potatoes where there should be homefries, no pancake dishes, very mediocre coffee< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>Place was packed!  We were asked if we would share a table with another couple and it worked out well. Met some newlyweds from Wisconsin who were very personable. Loved geting to know them!

Food was delicious! Shared the cinnamon pecan roll with my hubby. I had the smoked salmon scramble, with capers and cream cheese, served with your choice of toast, and potatoes.  If you've never been, you've gotta give it a try!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb_lNso4BCh3r5MDb9BWXBDrB3iboVzr6FjB5l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqNwlkjGtCwb4kOwMHWU79QYaIAOu0VqgTOTY2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Food is excellent, and service is good! They do not rush you although there is a queue outside. There was already a queue before they even opened! The food is worth the wait though.< /Review>

We stood in line for over 30 minutes.   With covid and limited roof seating that was fine. When we got to the front of the line we noticed the cooks not properly wearing masks. Unsanitary cooking habits such as wiping their hands on shirts and pants. No gloves or even aprons on. When they seen me watching them they, at that point put masks on properly.  One cool touched raw meat and then started to cut a loaf of bread. We left..< /text>

Arrived at 7am for 7:30am opening and there is already a line around the corner. Orders are taken based on when you were seated so be patient.  Huge portion - We ordered the "Open Road" which came with ham steak that takes up half of the plate.  Pancakes and French Toast comes as a side also a huge portion. For someone that doesn't eat much, order one to share with two.  We also tried their special grilled cornbread with pepper jelly - crunch, cheesy, a bit peppery, sweet and savory at the same time.  After a few bites, it can be kind of dry so pack more of the jelly on top!  Service is fairly slow on a Sunday morning.  We waited about 30 minutes before getting our food (plus 15 minutes before someone takes your order). So be prepared to wait!<//review>

<review>Mediocre at best. Service is just the bare minimum. Terrible long line at the entrance. Food is just too salty, too heavy, and drowned in oil. It’s just beyond me how people would rank this place so high.<//review>< GmapID>

We showed up and their website said they were open but the business looked abandoned and in a very scary part of town. Extremely disappointed as this was our last stop planned before we ended our trip.</Text>

Great little eatery in SF. We went for breakfast and had mixed reviews on their dishes (hence the 4 star). Staff was perfectly kind and on top of everything. We were seated immediately and walked through the menu. Tons of seasonal options and varying menu choices.

I ordered the famous pancakes and simple breakfast with eggs, bacon and potatoes. Right from the set down, the potatoes were awesome. They loaded me up on bacon which was nice but I couldn't finish it all. The pancakes were made with buck-wheat, ginger, and cinnamon and it was unlike any pancake I've ever had! I loved it!

We also ordered gluten-free pancakes but they weren't half as good. They were bland with little flavor. On top of that, slightly burnt. Our waiter did remove some of the fee with the gf pancakes. I'd definitely go back to try some more from here!

Note: I'm not very familiar with SF, but throughout our stay it seemed like we saw the most homelessness on this street... Making getting to and from the restaurant a quickly desired act.<//Review>

We had never been to San Francisco before, so we read books, magazines and did our research to cross analyze where to eat and we had epic fail after fail.

Our bodies were still on East Coast time and we decided to drop our books and wander for breakfast and voila!  Dottie’s True Blue Cafe delivered great coffee and amazing meals.

We bought the coffee mug and it takes us back to our trip every time we use it.

Can’t recommend enough. Every friend visiting San Francisco has agreed that it was wonderful.</Review>

Service was prompt and efficient. The atmosphere was chill and the listening to the blues was a welcome respite from the hecticnesss on the streets. The deco was a step back in time and I appreciated the 1960s deco and skylight. Ordered a pancake (which was huge) and a hot chocolate. The pancake was fluffy and light and the hot chocolate was the right amount of chocolate without being too sweet. Will definitely recommend.

Tip: Come during off peak hours. I came after 2pm and there was no queue.< /Review>

Pros - amazing food! I had the Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet made into a scramble. It was so good! My husband had a grilled chicken sandwich with an added fried egg (in the sandwich) - good an refreshing! The coffee was tasty and they had non-dairy milk options available. They took covid precautions seriously.

Cons - several people got on the yelp wait list, but the restaurant doesn't follow the yelp wait list. They should remove the option from their yelp page. The waiter seemed put out, and regularly forgot to refill our water and coffee. But I am going to assume he was having a rough day today. The menu downstairs doesn't represent what it currently available.

Overall - loved it!< /Review>

<Review>After an hour and 15 minute wait in the rain, I think I was expecting to be bowled over by this place. While the baked goods and specials were absolutely delicious, the staff was running around like crazy and didn't have time to give you a quality service experience.  We were sat at a communal table for fear of waiting longer than we already had which doesn't facilitate an intimate dining experience with family and friends.  I can definitely see the food being a big draw to the reason that people want to come here.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOujiZQcHl1x61TQmEv68lt2_rXOsSJPwYWFntc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuIktj98VkC2eEPJ87DXaGJp32379HJGW1gPtp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPedeKOUMm6ssz-5Gfc2Gv8UlVR8FzRsz-phwF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxgie1u_knu6S_b36iXz4CBnnlbFF738IoXwoy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPJy9vCu3S306ZUV6NMGx5-W5ENXCqC2SQeiXd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80858091d455bc5d:0x867a357594d7793d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Review>The food here is amazing. Farm Fresh Food directly to the table. Everything is made to order. Whenever you go, be prepared to wait in line for about 20-30mins, as the restaurant is small for the amount of foot traffic it gets. The food is well worth the wait. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>< user_id>

A scrappy little place that serves pretty good food, with good portion sizes. Ordered the frittata, and it was enjoyable. The restaurant gets pretty hot during warm weather, though admittedly I was there during record-setting summer temps. Careful with the bathroom doors; double check that you've locked the door. It's misleading!</review>

< Review>
We stood in line for over 30 minutes.   With covid and limited roof seating that was fine. When we got to the front of the line we noticed the cooks not properly wearing masks. Unsanitary cooking habits such as wiping their hands on shirts and pants. No gloves or even aprons on. When they seen me watching them they, at that point put masks on properly.  One cool touched raw meat and then started to cut a loaf of bread. We left..< /Review>

Plenty of good food for a nice breakfast. Bread is amazing, portions are big. I recommend the Open Road which is a complete breakfast. Go early as the waiting time can be a bit long< /Text>

We showed up and their website said they were open but the business looked abandoned and in a very scary part of town. Extremely disappointed as this was our last stop planned before we ended our trip.</text>

Amazing food. Great for breakfast. Pictured you'll see their chorizo scramble (which probably my favorite, and on their regular menu), their sweet potato, onion, and gruyere tart (also amazing, although a special [their specials all looked amazing, I wanted to try a fair share of them]), and their pancakes. Their pancakes were definitely made with special flour, and were amazing. They also had their homemade jam, which was delicious. The service was fairly slow, especially noticing when water is empty for awhile, but it wasn't too much of an issue. Staff very friendly, and I would definitely eat here again, and would 100% recommend. Just get their before 9 or you'll most likely have a wait.</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>I ordered “The Open Road”, one of their breakfast specials which included two eggs (any way you like it), Italian sausage (you can choose bacon or ham instead), home fries and two pancakes. I also had their regular coffee.

I wanted to love the food but I honestly felt underwhelmed by the taste of it. It was just the same or even slightly worse than I’ve had at other regular diners or brunch places. There is always a line at this place so it might be a testament to the fact that a lot of people like it, but other than the ambiance of the cafe and the live music playing at the corner of the cafe, I can’t see myself coming back for the food.<//text>< Pics>

The food is good and large portions. I've been here about 6 times now and haven't managed to eat all the food on my plate on any occasion. The menu is a mix of American, Mexican and European-inspired influences. The average price for a dish is $14-17 but 2 people could easily share one dish. The menu is mostly egg-based so it's more of a breakfast/brunch/lunchtime place, which is why it closes mid-afternoon. To be honest, even if it was open in the evening, I wouldn't go because it's in a dodgy area with alot of homeless and druggies. Despite this, I'd still go again because the food is worth it but only during the daytime.<//Review>

Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach, and Goat Cheese Omelet with house-made buttermilk dill toast served with home fries. The friendly, professional, and knowledgeable servers help navigate the menu that is supplemented by about a dozen specials on the chalkboard above the kitchen. You really can't go wrong. Do show up early as a line forms around the corner and down the alley full of those that know - it's worth the wait.<//text>

I love that in San Francisco, you can just wander into a simple store front and bre totally blown away. Dottie's did that to me. The space is a wide open homage to history, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Don't miss out on the lamb sausage, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.<//review>

I came here on a Monday at 11:30AM and there was quite a line. I'd recommend waking through Market street since it's a bit safer!

It has vintage and jazzy kind of feel, we felt like we were in New York! The cafe starts off with a bakery and the lady is super nice when you walk in. She'll tell you all the baked goods they have. The board on the top shows their daily or weekly specials (I forgot)

Now the food part, if you're carrying a menu with you still - DONT. Leave it at the front or you'll get yelled at like we did... They also offer you coffee when you first sir (I believe it's complimentary)

We ordered a smoked salmon... lunch plate (it was the only one on the menu). It was pretty good, it came with large chunk of salmon that was pretty dried up. We requested egg white which was an additional $1. The plate was so large that we shared it with 2 people. They recommended getting the dill as the side bread but it tasted like a garlic bread with no garlic. It looked like scramble eggs with salmon chunks and potato pieces. They were kind enough to split it into two.

My other friend ordered the avocado, tomato, jalepeno... special. It was too big for her to finish on her own and if she brought it back home it would've ended up soggy. There were a lot of flavors on the single bite and it looked like an omelette.

The portions are pretty large for a restaurant in SF.

In the end, we ordered a whiskey rum blueberry cake. This we ended up splitting with 3 people. The lady said this was one the most popular items. We loved it! Don't ask for it as "to go" if you want to take a photo, it comes in an aluminum foil. The crust was AMAZING, you could really taste the whiskey.

Overall I think it's a little over hyped. I'd come again for the pastries for sure. It was a little upsetting that they included the To Go order under the same bill (higher tax/tip) and it seemed like they were rushing us out. I guess it was pretty crowded.<//review>

<Review>Great breakfast food in a seedy area. I had to take away one star because of the location. On my visit to SF, I stayed on Nob Hill and decided to walk down to Dottie's at 7am on a Sat am. I had just watched it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives the week before and was excited to try it. As you walk from Nob Hill, through the Tenderloin, then across Market, you come across some craziness (from the homeless). Upon arriving at Dotties, there was a line into the adjoining alley with homeless people bothering the people in line. It was a bit uncomfortable. Anyway, the food was great and lived up to the hype on DDD.I had the Southwestern open faced omelet and a side of their wonderful pancakes. I would return, if I did not have to wait in line (good luck).<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxaiGgUgjVRnCBdEFrZahqBzwSwB7FWhUJyP8O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This is the worst coffee shop I've ever been to, no Crema, no latte art, coffee taste like milk, I have been waiting 30 mins for a muffin I've ordered. Will NEVER be comeing back to this place. Period..

Update, muffin was good, shame about some toast that had mould on it< /Text>

<text>I would never visit San Francisco without a visit to Dottie's for breakfast. Best is to order off the daily specials menu, not the regular menu, although all the food is fabulous, the specials are just that... special - really good. This cafe is on the edge of the less desirable "Tenderloin District" in SF but don't let it bother you. Also, be prepared for a fairly long wait. The line is usually out the door and around the corner of the building, but it is truly worth the wait. Just make sure you have a couple hours to get in and out.<//text><rating>5</rating>< pics>

Prepare for a loooong wait, especially Sunday morning. After the wait, I was enjoying delicious omelette with goat cheese. The coffee was also really good.

I think they are a little bit understaffed. Resulting in long lines and waitress chaotically running around and asking me several times (different waitress) whether I have ordered already.< /text>

Best is to order off the daily specials menu, not the regular menu, although all the food is fabulous, the specials are just that... special - really good. This cafe is on the edge of the less desirable "Tenderloin District" in SF but don't let it bother you. Also, be prepared for a fairly long wait. The line is usually out the door and around the corner of the building, but it is truly worth the wait. Just make sure you have a couple hours to get in and out.<//text>

<text>Great atmosphere and excellent food for breakfast or brunch. Heads up though, expect a 30-mins -ish wait in line on a weekend, and even longer if you're a party of more than 2.

We ordered one of their specials - chilaquiles with lamb merguez sausage - and one of their regular menu items: lamb merguez sausage, roasted garlic, tomato, spinach and goat cheese omelette. The chilaquiles was amazing, and the goat cheese oozing out of that scrumptious omelette just made my meal!</text>< gmapID>

Had a great brunch here on a Saturday morning. Great atmosphere with exposed brick and hard wood floors. The food was very tasty, with a lot of specials on the board when you walk in. Just be prepared to wait in a long line, we had to wait an hour to get in.</Review>

<text>Great menu and service! Any time I'm in San Francisco this is a must-stop when time permits. Daily specials on the chalk board usually pull me away from the menu, which is also great. Portions are wonderful in size and delicious!

<Text>Wow. That's the best way to describe the enormous and flavourful food here. Don't expect small portions, and under order or you'll leave extra on the plate.  Although very pricy (mind the expensive fruit and coffee add ons) the mains are worth the price. I had the raspberry banana pancakes, and my dining partner had the mascarpone filled cinnamon and pecan French toast - with real maple syrup on the side (as verified by a Canadian). Both are excellent choices. The regular black coffee and tea were bland, though, and the 'fresh squeezed' orange juice was disappointingly just box/concentrate juice. At $4 for each and $6 for a very small boul of fruit - that hurt. I also ordered a $4 muffin to go and never got it. I gave Dotties 3 stars despite this for it's amazing mains, but it struggles to achieve a higher grade due to the aforementioned failings. Although I would recommend to others, be warned: stick to the main dish only. We ended up paying $35 each with tip when our mains were $15 each, and if I'd had only two pancakes (I couldn't finish the 3rd) it would have been $11. Finally, the decor was interesting, and Dotties maintains an authentic historic vibe. 3/5<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwVYpWOUuNMugSZLJMzbblO9HvK2yX90FuJQb9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmrneGCLm79AWe9Madh4tAVOQ9QnknffJTpjQ_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKf3NrrjGxCTNoZqDURd-WqtFhixK4J5nHl1Zk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8kUI-DHFxCKNoHX5GqwFZVp5cRoGmwZA1bOqa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< user_id>

I found this place via very positive reviews. However, I must have overlooked mentions of parking or the long lines... BTW the wait was totally worth it. The area is a bit like most downtown cities, trash on the streets and some sketchy people walking around. BUT if you manage to find metered street parking (put enough to cover at least 2 hours!), and find your way over to this spot, be prepared to wait in line. Take the time to make friends with others in line, you'll have time to kill. I waited about 50 minutes and had to walk back to my car to put more time on the meter. Luckily I'm chatty and made friends with the folks around me so they were gracious enough to let me get back in line. It's a warm spot with an old school diner feel to it. Everyone is super polite and best of all the food is great. I had a basic breakfast, and I substituted a pancake for jalapeño corn bread. You must have the jalapeño jam - it's delicious and perfectly spiced. Next time, I'll try to get here earlier.</review>

It was fine. Ordered standard breakfast fare and got what I ordered. Will say that I didn't really care for the spiced pancakes, but they weren't bad, just not to my taste. Had a lot of nice looking pastries that we didn't get to.<//review>

A must for a breakfast in San Francisco. So yes the neighborhood is not the most chic and you will probably share the sidewalk with some homeless while waiting. But once you arrive at Dottie's you are in a 1950s atmosphere in a brick wall decor and you will enjoy a great breakfast with amazing pancakes. A great moment ...</review>

We came to the restaurant based on a recommendation from a friend. The place is nice and has a touch of an antique restaurant. There's no hostess and you just have to make a line until somebody comes to get you. Our server (Miguel) started off pretty good greeting us but then the owner/manager (Ivy) came to take the order, she was wearing a black hoodie with black pants and she had an ipad. She didn't introduce herself, I didn't know who she was but she caused the review to lose 2 stars. She was extremely serious and not helpful, straight face asked us what we wanted without offering recommendations or favorite plates. She looked like she just wanted to take the order and leave. That was extremely rude from her and definitely left a bad taste about the customer service in this place.
Besides that the food was awesome! Highly recommended just avoid the manager.</Text>

<text>Excellent food...LONG wait in line. Got in line at 940am and didn't get seated until just about 11. Then server took a while. That's the only reason for four stars as I was expecting the long wait but not the lackluster service. Overall, good brunch.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Amazing food. Great for breakfast. Pictured you'll see their chorizo scramble (which probably my favorite, and on their regular menu), their sweet potato, onion, and gruyere tart (also amazing, although a special [their specials all looked amazing, I wanted to try a fair share of them]), and their pancakes. Their pancakes were definitely made with special flour, and were amazing. They also had their homemade jam, which was delicious. The service was fairly slow, especially noticing when water is empty for awhile, but it wasn't too much of an issue. Staff very friendly, and I would definitely eat here again, and would 100% recommend. Just get their before 9 or you'll most likely have a wait.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqukIkBEqU5LS_mQHFkXe_1BRfy_kfaQZ5_OQ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Great atmosphere and excellent food for breakfast or brunch. Heads up though, expect a 30-mins -ish wait in line on a weekend, and even longer if you're a party of more than 2.

We ordered one of their specials - chilaquiles with lamb merguez sausage - and one of their regular menu items: lamb merguez sausage, roasted garlic, tomato, spinach and goat cheese omelette. The chilaquiles was amazing, and the goat cheese oozing out of that scrumptious omelette just made my meal!< /Review>< Resp>

No matter how you plan ahead to minimize the wait time, chances are you'll run into some interesting characters on your way in. During our half hour wait on a warm, sunny afternoon, a bumbling fellow knocks over a trash bin whilst scrounging for something to munch on. Oh, what a colorful place.
While you wait, you can stare at the menu in the doorway and figure out what you want. Once inside, there is a long bar down a narrow path of a jazzy interior with exposed brick walls and black and white photos of some pretty ladies. I especially appreciated the old-fashioned coffee mugs.

$4.50 Grilled Chili-Cheddar Corn Bread w/ Jalapeno Jelly:
Good corn bread that hits the right semi-sweet, slightly spicy flavors with a slight gritty texture. I would have liked it to be a little less dry, though.

$13.75 Three Egg Omelette w/ andouille, chorizo, smoked chicken-apple sausage, smoked whiskey-fennel sausage, avocado, gruyere, bleu cheese:
This enormous omelette was loaded with meaty sausage and melted  gruyere. It could have been a little more fluffy.

$16.95 Smoked Salmon, Caper, Tomato, Scallion and Natural Cream Cheese Scramble:
The smoked salmon had a lot more flavor than the sausage omelette. However, the more I dug into this, the saltiness really built up.

The portions were rather large. Both came with roasted potatoes. It just struck me that I should have ordered pancakes or something to balance out the high-protein, egg-heavy dishes we had. Perhaps next time I'm in the area, and hopefully on a day with a minimal line. Overall, I would say the quality of the food and variety of dishes is about a 7/10, a pretty decent brunch.</text>

I found myself having breakfast at Dottie's with my daughter after noticing the long line out there door and around the corner during the weekend. When I arrived I was greeted by unfriendly staff and an unnecessary wait. Initially the server was fine, nice enough but soon after for no reason at all became rude and inattentive. As we waited for our simple order (eggs toast home fries and a pancake) other people who were seated after received food. Finally my waitress comes by and slaps down a plate with two eggs and walks away. After a couple more minutes of waiting I flag her down and ask her to take the eggs back as I don't want cold eggs with the rest of my food. She takes them away with greatly annoyed and just doesn't come back. So I flag down another server and ask him to check what's up and eventually he brings the food. The waitress comes by with my kids pancake. Like why the garbage service and garbage attitude? Does my blackness make you assume I won't tip well? I will not be going back to Dottie's again and if you're a person of color I might find another spot too.

Food was alright nothing to write home about. You can get an equal breakfast just about anywhere else.</Text>

I had to take away one star because of the location. On my visit to SF, I stayed on Nob Hill and decided to walk down to Dottie's at 7am on a Sat am. I had just watched it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives the week before and was excited to try it. As you walk from Nob Hill, through the Tenderloin, then across Market, you come across some craziness (from the homeless). Upon arriving at Dotties, there was a line into the adjoining alley with homeless people bothering the people in line. It was a bit uncomfortable. Anyway, the food was great and lived up to the hype on DDD.I had the Southwestern open faced omelet and a side of their wonderful pancakes. I would return, if I did not have to wait in line (good luck).< /text></record></dataset><record>

If there is a better breakfast in San Francisco, I don’t know of it. You can’t have a bad meal here and I love coming back. Get there early, as the food, service and atmosphere is the best SF has to offer.</Text>

Great flavors and a variety of breakfast choices. The lamb meat omelette with goat cheese was delicious but nothing that would make me come back.  I still find it difficult to pay 20$+/person for breakfast food - as tasty as it may be - when I know I could make an omelette just as delicious. We had a friend visiting - so it was a treat for them and thy enjoyed it very much!</Review>

Had two breakfasts here while we were in San Francisco and could have had two more if there would not have been huge queue outside the restaurant one hour after opening. The prices were on the higher side, but for good reason. The portions were huge and really tasty and service was amazing. Although sometimes the waiters came to ask a bit too often if we would want more coffee or if anythings was okay, but of course it is better that way than to have to ask for service.

Also this place the most wonderful gluten free pancakes.

Believe the hype and the queues.</Text>

The long line is an indication of this places popularity.  I don't think it's just popular because of the name and older reviews either.

We came in to huge portions and super delicious food.  The buttermilk dill toast is incredible.  Slather on some butter and the raspberry preserves at your table and voila!  Perfection.

The only problem we had was the service wasn't so great.  You'd think they want to move you out faster and not ignore you because there is literally a line down the block.  Oh well, the food is good enough to overcome bad service.< /review>

They were out of several other sides, the OJ was on the menu as "fresh squeezed" but it was clearly pasteurized.

The egg dish my friend got was good, but not worth waiting in line for.

Haven't bothered to stand in line since they moved, but we won't be going back.  2 stars because the staff was great and the place is clean and nice.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Not as good as in the past. Omelette used to be very tasty. Now if you want to add any ingredient you pay 2.50 per item.</Text>

First time visiting San Fran and stopped here because of the reviews. The wait wasn’t worth the food and the food wasn’t worth the price. Nice atmosphere and kind folks though.

Enjoyed the Home Skillet restaurant right by it instead. Quick service and good food.< /review>

The food was no better than what you'd expect from a truck stop off the NJ Turnpike. It's as pricey as a breakfast spot usually is in SF which would be acceptable if the food wasn't so bad.

Service was really good. That's the only pro.

I'm completely confused how this place has such good reviews.< /Text>

Dottie's has very good food, but it feels a bit pretentious inside.  The pancakes tasted good, but they were very dense and overly complex. If you're just looking for a simple breakfast with a good cup of coffee then go elsewhere.  However, if you're in the mood for something more refined and complex then this is your place.  The decor is nice, and the food will likely satisfy.<//text>

1st time and not the last. Food qas fabulous.   There qas a 1 hr wait so patience is warranted, but the lamv sausage omelette was SCRUMPTIOUS.   The pancakes are yummy with the hi t of ginger and cinnamon.   And the butternilk dill bred qas surprisingly delicious.  The neighborhood is very sketchy so be aware of your surroundings,  lots of derelicts.<//text>

Disappointing!
First and foremost, the place was kind of dirty. I could smell the sewer in their kitchen... I've worked in restaurants when I was in college and I  know that smell very well.
And even worse, I didn't think the food was that great. The dishes sound interesting on the menu, but the special scrambles were a little over cooked, the scones and muffins were on the dry side - like they were left overs - and the blueberry pancakes had very few blueberries in them.
The only thing I liked was... come to think of it, there wasn't anything that I liked about this place.
I'm sorry to say I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone I care for.<//text>

The waitstaff was attentive and didn't rush us through breakfast despite the long line outside. We really enjoyed getting an early start to a day of walking around the city. Baked goods were really delicious if you want something to go. I wouldn't go here with more than 4 people due to seating and ambience. Fun decor and lots of interesting photos to take in while enjoying the food.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Name>Sonal P</Name><time>1497461062335< /time><Rate>1</Rate><review>After a long 45 min wait, in what I would call an "interesting" area of San Fran - a table was ready for us to be seated.

We sat down and immediately got offered fresh coffee. The ambiance was cute - had that historic building feel that was preserved with a diner type menu. After waiting another 10 minutes, someone popped by to take our order. We ordered the 2 eggs dish with the buttermilk dill and the black bean cakes.

I was drooling over the order and couldn't wait to see what the hype was all about. Our food was hot and made to order - which is definitely a nice perk. No one likes heat lamps! What disappointed me was the boring flavors and nothing so amazing about the food.

The only thing that got me happy was the crispy cornbread with the jalapeno jam. Other than that - there was nothing over the top or finger-lick-in good that made me want to inhale my plate.

The service was friendly, but they seemed overwhelmed with the rush. Then again, seeing how most of the reviews mentioned a line always here - I'm surprised they weren't used to having more people hands on. The food is not cheap here given the menu.< /review>< Pictures>

This place is awesome, I absolutely loved the breakfast I had. I arrived around 1030 AM, to have brunch. I loved sitting at the counter to see the cook make the food in the middle of the restaurant. Loved the baked goods and coffees they had near to the entrance of the restaurant, the bakery had large portions that looked delicious! The original famous sortie pancakes where just amazing!!! The taste was so good and perfect blend of cinnamon and vanilla!!! The omelets are large but made with fresh ingredients! Everything was amazing and the wait was about 15 minutes in line! The BEST BREAKFAST I HAD!!! WORTH THE VISIT!!! WILL GO BACK...WISH I LIVED IN SF JUST FOR THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!</Text>

When I was first told that I was going to be waiting in line for an hour (or more) just go get breakfast I was none-too-pleased.  The line extended from the foyer, around the corner, and down the adjacent alley about 50ft (~30-40 people in front of us).  I complained a little to my girlfriend about being able to walk down the street to get a table at another place fairly quickly.  She assured me, however, that it was worth the wait and it was most certainly that.

The line, despite its length, took roughly an hour and we were seated promptly once at the door.  We each ordered a breakfast entree (me: two eggs, potatoes, pancakes, and bacon; my girlfriend: two eggs, corn bread, and potatoes.  We also ordered a slice of the Prohibition Whiskey Blueberry Crumb Cake).  This ended up being enough food for four people.  The entire meal was great with the exception of the crumb cake... which was other-worldly amazing.

So, if you happen to go and there's a line you should definitely wait.  I would have easily waited longer, if necessary.< /review>

Had high expectations but ended up with an average experience. The good: portions were large, made for a filling brunch. Sandiwich I had was nice and the egg in it was soft, just right. The diced potatoes were bland and soggy. The fruit bowl was welcome after several days of fairly unhealthy diet. Couldn't say the service was friendliest.< /Text>

This was my first visit to Dottie's. I heard great things about this place and was not disappointed. I ordered the Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet. The lamb had this nice gamey bite to it that really enhanced the flavor of the dish. Also, the grilled chili cheddar corn bread with jalapeno jelly made for a great addition to the side. Heads up though, I hear you can experience a pretty long wait during peak hours. I went on a Monday morning and got in pretty quickly. Lastly, the service there was great with very personable staff.</Text>

Came on a Sunday for brunch and it was packed. Staff was very kind. Food we got was well worth it. Omelettes met high expectations and fresh bread and jam were really great. Only reason one star deduction was there's no lunch service on weekends, and one with our party did not want eggs, so menu is extremely limited on weekends for someone who didn't want eggs unfortunately. Otherwise positive and we'll be back.< /text>

The staff were on their A game. Food was ok. The potatoes aka Home Fries were really good. My 14 year old son and I split a plate and it was perfect for the two of us. My husband had a roll and it was huge. Coffee was great and always a full cup. The pancakes , eggs and bacon were standard breakfast fare.<//review>

I love what the city offers for food options. This place is another gem of a breakfast place in San Francisco! Ordered the zucchini and poached eggs special and it was delicious! Long lines over the weekend but definitely worth the wait. Efficient service at the table and food is served quicky.< /review>

<Text>After tackling the breakfast biscuit sandwich special at Dottie's, I wasn't hungry again until dinner. There's a reason this place had a line out the door when we arrived 15 minutes after opening. Not only was the food delicious and plentiful, but the coffee was good too (they'll send you off with a to go cup at no extra charge on your way out). Our server was awesome and even though the place was packed, we never felt rushed or forgotten about. Yes, it's a little pricey, but my plate was worth every penny.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80858091d455bc5d:0x867a357594d7793d< /GmapID></record>

Fantastic food!  They do a new take on all the classics and take each dish up a notch.  The pancakes are as big as my head and are delicious.  The only thing I suggest is they offer cream or half and half for the coffee instead of just milk.</text>

<review>It's no secret that Dottie's is well-regarded by both locals and press alike, but where other more ambitious restaurants might take advantage of the fame by expanding, raising prices, and compromising on the food, Dottie's keeps offering the same quality scratch-made food that they've been doing for years.

The restaurant serves up a majority of your standard breakfast fare, but given the line that I had to endure, I wasn't looking for any old breakfast foods. Three of the four of my dining companions felt similarly, and we all opted for off-menu specials. I had an omelet of feta, scallions, spinach, and some other vegetation that escapes me. It was good, but it's not a particularly difficult dish. It came with a serving of house-made soda bread, which seemed like it was missing something by itself, but I could see it being really good on a sandwich.

I grabbed a bite of some of the other dishes around the table: an omelet utilizing a very nice whiskey sausage, some great blueberry pancakes, and the black bean cakes. I think it was the black bean cakes that I most enjoyed, because it was also the most unique.

One of the reasons I don't care for breakfast is because so many of the items typically associated with it are so commonplace that a restaurant has no choice but to serve them. I would hope I could find some well-made pancakes or omelets in other places in the city. I regret not coming to Dottie's for lunch, because I have a feeling the chef is able to be more creative. I just didn't want to sit through any longer of a line.< /review>< gmap_id>

What a great place for breakfast! The food options are almost endless and everything is so tasty and perfect. The atmosphere is also great and very relaxed, with lots of families as well as young people. Definitely a place to go for breakfast. Beware - you are likely to queue for a long time before you get in, but it's totally worth it.</review>

<Text>1st time and not the last. Food qas fabulous.   There qas a 1 hr wait so patience is warranted, but the lamv sausage omelette was SCRUMPTIOUS.   The pancakes are yummy with the hi t of ginger and cinnamon.   And the butternilk dill bred qas surprisingly delicious.  The neighborhood is very sketchy so be aware of your surroundings,  lots of derelicts.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>After tackling the breakfast biscuit sandwich special at Dottie's, I wasn't hungry again until dinner. There's a reason this place had a line out the door when we arrived 15 minutes after opening. Not only was the food delicious and plentiful, but the coffee was good too (they'll send you off with a to go cup at no extra charge on your way out). Our server was awesome and even though the place was packed, we never felt rushed or forgotten about. Yes, it's a little pricey, but my plate was worth every penny.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<review>The staff were on their A game. Food was ok. The potatoes aka Home Fries were really good. My 14 year old son and I split a plate and it was perfect for the two of us. My husband had a roll and it was huge. Coffee was great and always a full cup. The pancakes , eggs and bacon were standard breakfast fare.<//review>< time>

It doesn't matter whether you get there at opening time or an hour later, there will always be a line out the door. I try to get there 15 minutes before it opens, that way at least I get seated pretty quickly.

Huge menu with tons of options, and I've liked everything on it.

Their pastries are particularly good, and they have a rotating pastry menu so you'll see more variety any time you come back.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< name>

This was my first visit to Dottie's. I heard great things about this place and was not disappointed. I ordered the Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet. The lamb had this nice gamey bite to it that really enhanced the flavor of the dish. Also, the grilled chili cheddar corn bread with jalapeno jelly made for a great addition to the side. Heads up though, I hear you can experience a pretty long wait during peak hours. I went on a Monday morning and got in pretty quickly. Lastly, the service there was great with very personable staff.< /Text>

Nothing to rave about. A bit more upscale than a diner. The food is below average. I ordered sunny side up which were over cooked. The bread want dense and needs more yeast. The potatoes didn't have that crispy pan grilled/seared exterior. The wild boar sausage was sweet.

Oh also be careful in this neighborhood. It's a busy Street but not safe. Our car window was smashed and my bag was stolen. Be careful.< /Text></record>

<text>Fine pastry with some special  in house recipe, but very mediocre brunch omelet stuff. The subpar thing is how they manage the long waiting queue during weekend. I saw over 8 bar seats wide open when I got to the top of queue after 1.5 hours waiting. Finally some of their waiters realized and asked people if they are fine with those seats.  4.3+ google and yelp rating is okay. But over 4000+ reviews?! Don't be fooled by the massive amount not worth the one hour waiting at all.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Expensive and pretentious but falls short on actual "wow factor." Honestly, my wife makes better scrambled eggs. The breakfast potatoes were just potatoes with no real seasoning. The mild sausage was...interesting, but not particularly delicious.

The French toast was probably the best thing I had there but although it was dense and eggy, it still seemed pretty plain. There was nothing particularly wrong with the food or the experience but neither was it worth the price. A quick trip to Denny's would have been just as good, in my opinion but not nearly as expensive.< /Review>

<review>The cornbread and jalapeno jelly are delicious, but I was unimpressed by the buttermilk biscuits. Portions are large and they have a fare (but not overwhelming) selection of vegetarian options. The ambeance is cozy and I love the moody jazz they play. Great place to eat comfort food on a cold day.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
So my girlfriend and I are visiting from Colorado for a few days and wanted to have brunch here. We show up at 1 p.m. and they have the gate closed. There hours say open until 3 p.m. We talk to a waiter and he says the owner decided to close early for the day. We had taken a 15 dollar Uber to the hood to get here. Wrote this to express the frustrations.</Review>

<text>For my first time staying in downtown San Francisco, I was told by a local guy that Dottie's was the place for breakfast.  He wasn't wrong.

This is not a place you would catch me in the dead of night.  This area of the city is dirty, smelly, and crime ridden.  But right here is this nice little cafe that serves the best breakfast in the city.< /text>< Pics>

<user_name>Chad Bearden<//user_name><review>There was a line out the door when we were walking around looking for a place to eat, so we figured it had to be good. Did not take too long to be seating and the waiter was helpful with the list of food options. I got the scramble, wife got the zucchini cakes with poached eggs and our friend got the smoked ham and eggs bagel. I was able to try each and they were all very good. Not one egg was overcooked. Most plates came with potato wedges and corn bread. Potato was great. Not too salty and not too crispy. The corn bread was dry with little flavor. In comparison to typical south eastern US cornbread it was underwhelming. I still give this place 5 stars because everything else was great.< /review><Time>1466777832914<//Time></record>

Looking forward to an intimate breakfast setting, my wife and I waited in line, and were then escorted to a table of 8.  She sat at the end of the table and I sat adjacent and across from a stranger.  Five other strangers were squeezed in to the table.  My omelette did not come with cheese.  I was left feeling I spent too much money for a not-so-great experience, considering the add-on prices.  The food itself was good enough.<//Text>

Though it was very interesting to stand around in a very shabby part of SF. We had homeless yelling at us, a lady was carrying a cat on her head and another one walked by bare naked. I waited in a lot of queues around the world, but this was by far the most interesting one. That's worth one star. The food and service I give 2. It's average food in an average place and a bit overpriced. If the staff would be more on the ball, there would hardly be a queue around the corner. Tables were empty for about 15 minutes after customers left, when we were waiting a party of eight people left but nobody moved in... Things like that make me thinking that it's part of the concept. Next day we went to a random place around Union Square. Same price, better quality, no wait. But also no entertainment while waiting...< /review>< Pics>

Yum yum yum. I've been here a couple of times. On the weekend around 11am with a 2-hour wait and on a Friday around 10am with a few minutes' wait. Obviously, go during non-peak times if you can. Their biscuits are moist and delicious and their omelets are fluffy and flavorful. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been.< /review>

Everything here made to order. Breads are made in the restaurant and are amazing and delicious.
Coffee was so so but there are so many other great things about this restaurant that it doesn't matter.
Get the scramble with the homefries and any type of toast. Make sure you use the raspberry jam on the table for that toast and just make sure you get there early or you will wait for a long time.</Text>

Got squeezed in on Sunday morning right before it got busy. It was unfortunate that our party of 4 had to sit at the bar, because it limited conversation across the 4 of us. Got french toast, pancakes, black bean cakes and a scramble. All were fantastic. French Toast was very heavy. It would best be split between a couple of people. Pancakes were very good; the cinnamon was very pleasant. Black bean cakes were "pretty good" according to my friend. Scramble was delicious. Portions are ok for the price (average is $14-15 per plate) but would be generous elsewhere. They charge for every little thing here, so be sure to ask so you don't get any surprise charges later.</text>

<Review>Great breakfast. Great atmosphere. Worth the wait. Nice and calm inside. Staff was wonderful. Location isn't great but once you get past the line it's cozy inside. Save room for desserts!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>A line around the block and a local recommendation, we were compelled to try out this spot. Creative menu and a lot of delicious sounding options to choose from. I ordered the Open Road breakfast - eggs, protein (bacon, ham, or Italian sausage), potatoes, and 2 pancakes. Service was pretty fast, food was delicious - mix of tasty and fresh ingredients really made the flavors dance on my taste buds. Wish I had room left to try one of the delicious daily desserts, may have to drop by tomorrow and get one to go. BTW I love all the photos of beautiful African-American women on the walls. Give this spot a try and your taste buds will thank you!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>Absolutely delicious. Had a little bit of everything within our group and everything we had was great. Had the banana raspberry gluten free pancakes and they were mouth watering. We also had the pork belly and Jack cheese quessidilla and it was by far the best thing I have ever eaten for breakfast. Would recommend and would say most definitely wait in line. It is worth it!!!<//Review>< gmap_id>

The food here is beyond amazing. The portions are big and the prices are decent. Just be prepared to wait in line for 30-45 minutes during peak hours as they do not take reservations. The whiskey fennel sausage scramble is my favorite! Their coffee is pretty great, too.<//text>

I came to see the place on August 10th 2019. The beautiful eclectic sign drew me in. However once inside I realised that much was special. Unless you're a huge fan of Eggs or Pastries you won't find Dooties very appealing.< /text>

It's fine--just fine. Food is typical breakfast food. Portions are decent-sized but also fully priced. Interior is nice!

4 stars because it is what it's supposed to be. However, I almost want to give it 3 stars just for the inevitable and unjustifiable 45 minute wait. It seems so pointless to wait in line just to eat at a place with food that's basically interchangeable with a dozen other greasy spoons out there.<//text>

I used to work around the corner from this place and had several co-workers who avoided gluten so we came here sometimes. I found the service to be reasonable for the area, prices to be high but not too high for the area and for specialty food, but every single item I ever ordered bordered on inedible. Their bread is dry and flavorless and I don't understand how people can rave about the pancakes. Maybe it is because I cook and bake myself, but when I make gluten-free or vegan dishes, I try to make them actually close to what they are replacing. I never once had a satisfying meal at this place, in spite of rave reviews from friends and co-workers.

To each his own, but this place was not for me.<//review>

These guys have good food. But, if there's a long line at the door... They're probably not worth the wait. Today's staff seemed overwhelmed, inattentive, and ignorant to what people needed.

As a single customer, I waited in line for 45 minutes,  and was eventually seated at the end of another family's table, despite the open seats at the bar. I had to repeatedly ask for silverware, coffee refills, and condiments.

The food simply doesn't justify the wait or the poor service.< /text>

We love Dottie's and wake up early just to have breakfast here. My husband swears this is the best breakfast place ever, in the whole world. I think they definitely make great breakfast and the place is charming inside. A lot of the time, there would be a line out the door, wrapping around the side of the building if you don't get there early enough, unless you somehow get lucky. Not gonna lie, this is in the shady part of San Francisco and I probably would have never found out about this place if it weren't for my husband bringing me here. Still, he gets very protective when we come here and tell me not to have my phone out and not to make any eye contact with anyone yelling out on the streets. Personally, I haven't seen anything dangerous happening whenever we're walking to Dottie's, but we don't stick around long enough to see anything.

It's usually easier for one person to get a seat here (most likely at the bar) and the wait gets longer for big groups, because tables that accommodate groups are few.

We usually have two eggs scrambled, but we request to have ham and cheddar cheese mixed in, and it is perfect! That's what makes my husband loves this place so much. He tells everyone about this place, just for their scrambled eggs. He's the pickiest eater I know. I've tried things off their specials menu and they are absolutely amazing. Definitely try their specials if you're a foodie. They're really good at this breakfast thing. Things off the menu are usually filling, but the portions are just right. It always makes me feel ready to start the day!</Text>

If you find yourself hungry in the shabby part of soma, Dottie's is the place for you.
Unfortunately, Dottie's is not what it used to be since the owner retired and sold his business.
The food is still good compared to other breakfast places in San Francisco, but the quality is slacking and they raised the prices on most of their menu. The restaurant is really loud, you have to raise your voice quit a bit in order for your breakfast companions to hear you.
Overall it's still a good place to eat breakfast, the staff is friendly, despite the price hikes the menu is affordable for San Francisco, and the food is good.
On the minus side: the restaurant is very loud, the neighborhood is filthy, and the waiting line can take over one hour during the weekend.<//Text>

Best breakfast anywhere. I travel alot and have experienced many breakfast places. I have several favorites but Dottie's is always the one I mention first. Yes, like many reviewers note, you will wait in line to get in. And your whole party must be present before they seat you (it's the best way in my opinion to handle large volume; why should you sit and take up space anyway?). But it is well worth the wait. Some reviewers say it's expensive. They must be ordering way too much food. The portions are enormous and, yes, while its not Denny's or McDonald's the $13.50 you pay for eggs, potatoes, toast, and sausage is worth  every penny. You will not need to eat again till evening. Don't order lots of things thinking you are getting tiny samples of everything. And we're not just talking standard fare. The toast is a house made buttermilk fill bread. The pancakes are cinnamon ginger. The potatoes are grilled, and indeed all the food is prepared, to order literally before your eyes. Freshest, generous food made just for you.<//Text>

<text>Staff are great and the pancakes are awesome. The home fries tasted like gasoline though and the scrambled eggs weren't nice (over cooked, no flavour and cold). The hot link sausage is fabulous but over all I don't think I'd be back. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day but it what I got food wise and for the price ($34!) isn't worth waiting for in the super long line to get a seat.</text>< Resp>

Food is really good! I had the pull pork, blueberry crumb cake and both was nice and hot when it came. Service was great but line is long depending on what time you get there. We waited 45 min before getting seats .<//review>

This was the best breakfast experience I have ever had. I ordered the pulled pork scrambled eggs with flour tortillas, salsa and home fries and it was great! Full of flavor, big portion and the coffee was pretty damn good too. Friendly staff and great food makes the wait in line worth it! Best breakfast spot in San Francisco.</Text>

I do not and will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The staff seemed to be in a rush and the customer service is subpar. My coffee was cold and i sent my order back twice and it still was not prepared right.  The only thing that was offered to me was to take it back again and cancel my order or have them remake it after they finished with other order.  By this time my party was finished with their meal. No compensation or anything for the inconvenience. There is also a long wait to eat here.  I will never come back here.</review>

There was a queue for getting breakfast when I went here, so I knew I was in for something special. This place has a fantastic atmosphere, and the staff were really friendly. The coffee tastes amazing, and is fetched for you as you take a seat - a lovely touch. I got 'the open road' and was impressed at the MASSIVE portion. Everything tasted great, left very satisfied.< /review>

<text>We had brunch here with two friends. We waited 1 for an average brunch bar you could get at most diners. When one of us asked for the lamb omelet with no lamb, the waiter chuckled, and my friend (vegetarian) felt awkward and stopped looking forward to her meal.

The only best part was the pastries. Apparently they have a pastry chef who stays overnight to make them. They were good.< /text>< GmapID>

I don't like giving bad reviews, and some times I just don't write a review if the place is not that good, but today I feel a little scam with this place, I'm not sure why this place have some many reviews and 4 stars? We order what the waitress recommend, the frittata and the french toast, the frittata came with potatoes that taste bad, the bread was good, the frittata was normal, the french toast was so bad and dry, and I think the waitress knew because he didn't even ask how the food was! also the wall in front of our table was so dirty! bad experience... is sad... attach are pictures of the wall and the french toast that I did no finish, my husband eat it because he is a saint and eat everything<//Review>

I think what I ordered is called the 'One Stop'. I cant remember tho but it did come with 2 pancakes, 4 strips of bacon, eggs & home fries (Breakfast  Potatoes). Below are my ratings for each. 1 to 10.... 1 being the worst - 10 being the best!

Pancakes 7.5
Bacon 8
Eggs 7
Home Fries 5
I also tasted....
French Toast 6.5
Italian Sausage 6.5 or 7 cant decide
Fruit 7

I would give my meal under a 4 but not lower than a 3. I cant rate in the middle so I gave it a 3 star rating. I made sure I came here through the week bc the line is shorter than a Saturday or Sunday. The line is outrageous on those days. No matter if this place had the best food on the plant, I'm not waiting. Bless the people who can stand in a block long line. You'll still stand in a line on a weekday but it's a lot faster. Go early Mon Tues or Thr. Closed on Wed

Is this place worth standing in a mile long line judging by what my party ordered and what I tasted, NO.
Would I come back to try other things, Yes.
This place is worth a try, once or twice.<//Text>

I'm pretty sure that this review will be a repetition of many others, but I'll say it again regardless.
The food was great. Nice portions, fresh and hot. The location...ick. The city seriously needs to do something about the Tenderloin area. I'm not sure I really wan't to see people go to the bathroom in front of the restaurant while I'm waiting for a table.<//text>

tl;dr - not a bad place to eat but not worth a long wait.

We stopped by Dottie's on a Friday morning and ended up waiting in a relatively short line for probably 20 minutes.  Staff was super nice.  The drip coffee was pretty horrendous (extremely bitter, burnt/over roasted  flavor).  I've had better coffee at Waffle House.  My wife and I both ate egg dishes.  The portions were quite large and tasty but nothing that screamed "incredible".  The roasted potatoes as a side were nothing to write home about.  I will say that the pastries looked delicious but we abstained so maybe it is incredible if a sweet treat is what you're after.

Bottom line, if you can walk right in and get a seat it's a pleasant experience but not really worth going out of your way or waiting in an epic line.</text>

<Text>I don't understand all the hype going around this place. At 8am I already had to wait for 15/20 minutes to be seated (I was alone). I overheard one guy saying to a bunch of tourist that he already had stayed in the line which went way out around the corner for 1h 30m because this place is "so delicious".

Seriously? No, no, no. The beverages were of low quality: machine-made cappuccino and I would bet my hand the " fresh squeezed" orange juice is actually bottled.

The food was OK but really not outstanding, although I already got things of better quality in other places in SF with much less wait time.

The service is slow indeed, as many reviews mention it.  They are well under staffed. I think this is an important factor causing the line outside. As I'm writing this review, next to me at the bar the seat has been empty for 15 minutes. Worse: a 10 person table behind me has waited 15 minutes before getting undressed! Honestly I wonder if this slowness is not created on purpose to keep the line long and fuel the hype.< /Text><userid>114963372576444344651< /userid>< username>

<Text>We queued here for possibly more than an hour, due to online recommendations and from those in the queue itself. Despite the waiting masses, the staff appeared to be in no rush to get prospective customers in, with tables sitting uncleared for an extended period. The espresso I had was good, but the food itself was nothing special - the eggs were lacking in flavour. Sausage was pretty good but I've had much better in places were there was no need to queue. All in all, not worth the hype or the wait.</Text>< rate>

The avocado feta frittata was really awesome. This is real confort food, brunch was great and people working here friendly. We wait about 20 minutes to get in (but it seems it can be really worse). Would gladly return.< /Review>

Loved it. Walked several blocks and stood in line for almost 2hrs and would do it all over again. Staff was friendly. Menu has a wonderful variety. Food was best meal we had during our whole vacation. Sent friends visiting San Francisco there  also. Cornbread with pepper jelly is to die for.< /review>

Well...I'm not so sure if this was worth the wait...the breakfast is pretty standard. Not to say it's not delicious. But the wait is not worth it. And the time I visited the place, the bathroom was broken. That didn't help with the review......<//Text>

Table turnover is slow, servers are slow and pretty rude here. Food was not bad, but not amazing either.

I tried the Fried egg prosciutto avocado provolone breakfast sandwich ($13?)  - this was pretty good! the prosciutto was crispy.. and the cheese was so goood....(highlight of this place!) but the biscuit was really thick and I couldn't finish it. I also wished the fried egg was cooked runny because it was cooked close to well done but I guess we could've asked for it to be cooked runny. This sandwich also came with potatoes and I thought they were OK because I prefer my potatoes on the crispy side.

Also had the classic pancake and the blueberry cornbread pancake. I thought the original pancake was a little too cinnamon-y and the cornbread pancake wasn't super special either.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area. Dottie's wouldn't be a personal choice of mine.<//Text>

<text>In true SF fashion, we waited for an hour in line  but the breakfast was gratifying and filling. I ordered the avocado tomato frittata with buttermilk bread. The bread was so fluffy and flaky and perfect with their chilly jam (if you specially request it). Perfect with a mimosa brunch.< /text>< Name>

We went to breakfast on a Sunday, that was the wrong day to go visit. Wait was over 2 hours it was not worth that kind of time out of my day. The food was good the service was kind and efficient. My rating is mostly off the crazy wait time.<//text>

The wait time is worth it. Order from their specials board. Their sweet rolls are TO DIE FOR. They make HUGE muffins! It's comfort food done really well. You will leave stuffed and happy. My two favorite things. :]

And atmosphere? I want to hang out there all day. Jazz music, antique decor, Dorothy Dandridge all over the place — you will either love it or at least find it extremely charming.<//Text>

So obviously I wanted to go because of the amazing reviews. We get there and there is a fairly long line which takes about an hour till we get to sit. I tried the pancakes- yummy, the cinnamon and spices make it quite flavorful, the dill bread- very tasty, and I got the spicy whiskey fennel sausage omelet, which was ok...not very unique.

Honestly, not worth the wait, the bad parking situation, the shady location, and the service. It was good food, but I won't go back unless there is no line.< /Text>

Update: The owner isn't perhaps as bad as I thought. The last time I went in he was smiling and friendly to us as we were leaving.<//Text>

The bread was so fluffy and flaky and perfect with their chilly jam (if you specially request it). Perfect with a mimosa brunch.<//Text>< Pics>

Delicious food and generous portions. Prices are reasonable for the city. There is almost always a wait on weekends, so come early. Service was fast and courteous, all of the staff seem well trained and polite. The whiskey blueberry crumb cake was a delicious treat, and my scramble was very good, but I doubt you can go wrong with any item on the menu. Atmosphere is cozy.</Text>

The food gets 5 stars. Such big portions and everything was delicious. The service gets 3. If you get there after 8:30am, you will wait to be seated, especially on the weekend. They have a new process for putting in orders and it's a bit ludicrous. We were ready to order, but had to wait for the tables that sat before us to do so. Kind of ridiculous to have to wait for other indecisive people to make up their minds. Will go back and will get their earlier.<//Text>

I was getting really tired of going to the newest trendy brunch spots when realistically I am too hungry to care or get hangry standing in a long line. The food is amazing! I got the morning glory sandwich and eggs Benedict with chorizo. Sooo good. I couldn’t finish my plate soo great portion sizes! I wish they served mimosas...timely service tho< /Review>

<Text>The "Lamb Merguez Sausage, Roasted Garlic, Tomato, Spinach And Goat Cheese Omelette" was as much of a (yummy) mouthful as it is to say. It's super delicious and uses a satisfying ratio of quality ingredients; that is, they definitely didn't skimp on the goat cheese or lamb sausage. Would definitely order again. I opted for the side of fruit (blackberries, strawberries, melon--all nice and fresh) and the buttermilk toast, which was so hearty! I didn't see any need to put butter or jam on it -- the texture is coarse and the crust is thick, so the experience of eating it plain was amazing by itself.

I'm bumping this review down to 4 stars because waiting for an hour outside near the Tenderloin was not fun. I'm also a sucker for novel flavors, so while the notes in this omelette pair very well, these flavors bring nothing new to the palate table.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80858091d455bc5d:0x867a357594d7793d</Gmap_id></record>

<text>Nothing special that's worth the waiting lines outside, and we tried 5 different dishes all were average. Staff are cold, careless and somehow rude; the food arrived and no cutlery didn't, empty hot sauce bottles never got replaced and a sticky maple syrup bottle on stained plates. Finally, for a "Cafe" the coffee was not good at all.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Really good brunch spot! The wait always looks bad, but tables turn pretty fast here. Don't forget to take a look at their specials menu before you sit down because there's always something good on there. The servers are all really nice too! Parking is a little bit of a pain here, but well worth the parking and waiting pain!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80858091d455bc5d:0x867a357594d7793d</Gmap_id>< Rating>

Dottie's blueberry pancakes are to die for. Although the wait is long and the location is not in the greatest of areas in the city, it is most definitely worth it. Good breakfast, good coffee and a homey atmosphere. I recommend to any San Francisco visitor.</Review>

I ordered lamb sausage with goat cheese omelette which came with home fries and extra thick buttermilk dill toast. The potatoes had a nice crisp to them which is usually not the case for potatoes served in a diner. The toast was amazing and quite buttery. My wife had French toast and scrambled eggs, and we shared a massive pancake. We finished every last bite. Don't leave without trying their bloody mary.

<text>Dottie's is regarded as one of the best brunch places in the cities.  It's really great, but the wait time is ridiculous.  The only way to shorten your time if you want to go to Dottie's is by going alone or with only 1 more person.  They normally ask for groups of 2 and jump them in line.  We waited for 2.5hrs for a group of 6 on a sunday morning.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Food was amazing! Had to wait in line, but it was worth it!  Only problem was having to decide what to order!
We had "The Open Road" and two specials, a fried egg biscuit sandwich with prosciutto, avocado and cheese (came with fruit and home fries), and the marscapone raspberry stuffed french toast.
Then we grabbed a banana rum caramel roll to take with us.
Everything was great!<//review>< pictures>

Good food, but not worth the wait. At 10 persons deep in line the wait was  20 minutes, no sweat. As I left I felt sorry for those waiting 30-40 deep. The food is not worth an hr wait or cost. Waitstaff quality varies, some will help push the crowd through others are very lax with little purpose. Expect high price.

I would go back, but arrive no later than 7:45am.< /review>

I'd been wanting to get brunch here for sometime now and finally got up early on a Sunday morning and to my surprise the line was still out the door before 8AM. The line moves slow so be prepared to wait in a awful sewage and urine like smell the neighborhood has to offer. In my time waiting, a bum fight broke out and a dog attacked another dog that almost started another fight.   As for the food, it's good. Not 5 star worthy though.  I won't consider the area and my wait in line against the restaurant though and service could be better. I probably wont go again but glad I got to try it.<//Review>

NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Be warned even if you know what you want when you sit down, waiters take orders in the order the table was seated. I started with the low-fat banana chocolate shake, first sip was great, then the shake separated and tasted powdery, like I was chewing granules. Then came the giant pecan roll (too much for 1 person, suggest sharing!), but alas I've had much better pecan cinnamon rolls, they were not very sweet, and not a lot of flavor. Then came the main meal, I chose the zucchini cakes off the daily specials and here we go again with no flavor there either, very bland. The pancakes were overcooked, crispy and thin. Bacon is thick cut. Overall we were very disappointed. The best tasting part of my meal was the fresh fruit.< /Text>

A really solid assortment of foods.  The outside makes it look innocuous enough, but inside it's vibrant and warm.  Don't let the line scare you.  It's really worth it.< /Review>

<review>Good service, delicious food, but really expensive--to the point of diminishing the value proposition.  For 2 breakfast entrees, 1 cup of coffee, and 1 pancake on the side, our bill was forty bucks -- before tip!   If you go, make sure to try the buttermilk dill bread.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< username>

Food was amazing! Had to wait in line, but it was worth it!  Only problem was having to decide what to order!
We had "The Open Road" and two specials, a fried egg biscuit sandwich with prosciutto, avocado and cheese (came with fruit and home fries), and the marscapone raspberry stuffed french toast.
Then we grabbed a banana rum caramel roll to take with us.
Everything was great!< /Text>

Ridiculously good breakfast. I was skeptical at first that the 60 minutes+ wait would be worth it. Glad I waited. Went back the very next day and stood in line for another 50 minutes. Their pancakes are delish as are their made from scratch cinnamon rolls with pecans. Service was great too. Very friendly. Never had to wait to get a coffee refill. Plus they don't rush you even if there are 30 people in line waiting to get in. Highly recommended!! Next time I'm in San Francisco I know where I'll be having breakfast.</text>

<review>If I Didn't Know Better I think that this place caters to the pandering of the homeless in the alley. As you wait outside and urine covered feces coverage trees to eat breakfast and what you heard was a very well review place. You are asked for money you are entertained you are annoyed and you're still hungry waiting in the alley for your turn to sit at a table to view the alley and eat breakfast. Most of the staff is non English. Most of the alley is filled with homeless. I will never return here it is not worth my time nor my patients to eat minimally basic food in a drug-infested alley just for the sake of the reviews that I thought were true. The food is basic non-season cook by Latino Hispanic people and served with a view of what would be seen is the lower level of San Francisco no thanks<//review>< pictures>

My family and I came for a birthday for my nephew,  the owner sat us at a dirty table , poured us coffee and gave no cream. We asked ti have some pastry before breakfast and she said no. You order everything now or leave so we left. The original owner has sold this place so it is not the same vibe, don't waste your time coming here. Rude, Rude, Rude.
And my expectations are not that high.<//review>

Waited over an hour to eat here (it was worth it) - but at least you don't get bored as you take in the sights, sounds and well, the smells of the tenderloin district as you wait in line.  Can't speak to Lunch or Dinner - but I can definitely recommend going here for breakfast or brunch.  Wonderful food with fresh ingredients, including bread baked fresh nightly.</Text>

Great breakfast and lunch place.
Oversized portions and never empty coffee. If egg portions are too big ask for 2 versus 3 eggs for omelettes or other egg dishes.<//text>

Fabulous breakfast spot with some really fun menu choices. Frittata special of the day was too die for. Our server was pretty fabulous too! Neighborhood was a little gritty but that just added to the experience. Loved this place...< /review>

Long wait for a table and food but it was during the lunch rush. Sandwich was a little complicated because of the bread, but worth the mess; excellent side salad! Very attentive servers (and bussers?).</text>

I don't know how the food is. The line never moved. It must be good. We went around the corner after waiting in a urine soaked alley for a bit and walked right in to a different breakfast joint. Food was excellent there as well.</review>

Was it worth the wait? Unfortunately yes. This place, unlike Mama's, definitely lived up to the hype for me. It is a bit pricey but if you have people constantly lined out your door it is hard for me to fault them for that. Their lamb sausage omelette let something to be desired but the Southwestern was amazing, I would highly recommend it. The side of bacon was a bust, I was hoping for nice thick cut tasty bacon but unfortunately it was just run of the mill. All and all I would definitely go back here but the lines are definitely a reason to stay away.</Review>

My favorite place for brunch in San Francisco! I usually have their breakfast combo with pancakes, eggs and bacon. Their baked goods are great. The wait can be very long in the weekends, but it's worth it. The area where it's located (6th street) is not very nice, unfortunately.< /Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>My friends and I enjoyed our food:  well-seasoned, nicely cooked, and generously portioned.  The cornbread was different than your typical cornbread, but quite tasty!

With that said, I didn't find any of the food to be outstanding, and I was a bit gobsmacked that we were charged for the jelly (that I assumed just came with the cornbread).  Nickel and diming like that just seems silly and petty and dampens an otherwise fine meal... especially when the brunch itself is a bit on the pricey side.

Another downside:  the area is rather sketchy; wouldn't recommend parking an expensive car here, for instance :\.

On the brighter side:  our wait (for three people on a weekend) wasn't that long, and our server was cheerful and helpful.< /Text>< pics>

After having waited in line, outside in an extremely low-income area, for an hour and then taking my first bite into an egg meal, I was disappointed.   I knew as soon as the first bite of food hit my mouth that the taste didn't justify the wait.   In fact, during the wait, I walked down the street to a dilapidated market store owned by a Russian - and I asked him "So is it worth the wait at Dottie's?"  He replied with a shrug... Then said in a thick Russian accent "Would I wait in line for 1 1/2 hours for breakfast?  Probably not."    Turns out the Russian was right.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Thanks to the ridiculous line at Mama's, we visited this jewel of the Tenderloin.  On a Sunday at 1pm, this place was still packed with a 45 minute  wait.  The wait turned into an initiation rite, thanks to the cast of homeless characters in the area. The crowd of panhandlers turned a little nasty when one lady decided to show off her adult diapers to the crowd. Mmm mmm hard to keep that appetite up, but the struggle was well worth it.

The short stack was amazing. The hint of cinnamon and ginger really added a kick. You've wasted a trip unless you've ordered the short stack. Aside from that, we tried the scramble specials:
1) Fennel Sausage, Spinach and Mushrooms
2) Lamb Sausage
3) Prosciutto, Basil, Roasted tomatoes
1 and 2 were my favorites but all were delicious. The portions were hearty and the jalapeno cornbread was a nice addition. Service was very quick but not rushed. Must try if you can't make it out to Mama's.< /Review>

This was our first visit to beautiful San Francisco. Our experience at Dotties True Blue Cafe was very disappointing. This place was highly recommended but did not even meet expectations. We were greeted by a very pleasant young lady who seated us. After that it was downhill from there. It started with our waiter who didnt even put our order in when we ordered. When we sat down we were the only ones at the table. While waiting on our food they sat a couple, a single man and two single women with us and they all placed their orders. You guessed it all of their food orders came out before ours. So we asked the waiter when could we expect our food he said let me check. He goes to a lady who appears to be the manager or lead. You could see the confusion on both their faces. The manager/lead went to the kitchen to "see" what was going on with our order,  nothing because the waiter didnt put it in. When I asked the manager/lead what was going on all that she said was they are working on it. I deal with customer service daily so I have patience in this area. 30 to 35 minutes had passed still no food. The manager/lead wouldn't even acknowledge us in that we still hadnt receive our food. No explanation nothing. When we did finally receive our food it was wrong. My husband ordered pancakes they brought French toast. I ordered a build your own omelet it was missing ingredients. The pancakes were good per my husband however everything else wasnt so much. I am pretty sure that this is not the representation that the owner of Dotties would want for its customers.</Review>

I seriously don't know what all the hype is about this place.... First off this place is in a very sketchy part of town where there is homeless and sketchy people EVERYWHERE....  Waited an hour and a half to be seated.. I ordered the cornmeal blueberry pancake with the lamb omelette with home fries.. The pancake was tasteless and dry. The potatoes were undercooked. . Definitely not worth the wait, let alone the price... I ordered a cinnamon roll to go, it was huge but super dry... Very disappointed and a waste of time!</Review>

Friends told me about this place.  Yeah, they said it was good, but I never expected to experience a culinary epiphany.  That experience, my friends, came in the form of a Blueberry Crumb Cake topped with Fresh Whipped Cream.

OK, this is not one of those exaggerations you always see on Yelp, by some poser who is trying to make their review really stand out.

A generous portion of this coffee cake arrived at our table, steaming hot, with the cream already starting to melt.  A dense, yet amazingly moist cake, topped with a layer of blueberry, which was covered with a sweet crumb topping.  This may sound sicky-sweet, but it wasn't.  Each element tempered the other, culminating the perfect balance.

If you order this, make sure to eat it while it is hot.  The magic is gone once this baby cools down.  When that happens, just push it to the edge of the table.  No, I'm serious.  Just do it!

The cinnamon raisin French toast with toasted pecans was very good, almost too sweet.  If you can finish yours, you're a better man than I (even if you're a man).

They have numerous daily specials on the board.  One of them was the pulled pork, roasted onion & Jack cheese scramble which my wife ordered.  It was delightful.  I would get this again, and again.

Add the totally cute interior and a staff that is a well oiled machine, and Dotties delivers everything you've ever hoped for in a breakfast joint, except for maybe the wait... but its well worth it.

Home cooking done exceptionally well, with culinary sparks dispersed throughout the menu.< /review>

When my wife told me that we were going to wait in line for an hour for breakfast I started to plan our divorce.   However, the food,  service, and cleanliness lived up to the hype.   Make no mistake. The location is harsh.   I had several vagrants ask for money,  witnessed 3 drug deals and watched one woman light up her meth pipe 20 feet from me. We waited for just under an hour starting at 9:00 am Monday.< /text>

2nd time here and was hoping for the same satisfying experience as we felt about a year ago. But the wait did seem much longer (over 30 mins) this time around plus another half hour for the food. Bacon was served burnt (black spots) and the French toast, pancakes, and wheat bread tasted awfully similar.  We spent so much time trying to eat breakfast here though he ended up canceling plans for the rest of our trip. Overall, service was very slow, almost felt like very understaffed. At the end, not worth it, lost a customer:-(<//Text>

The food at this place is ok personally. The pancakes tastes very strongly of ginger and the eggs along with potatoes are average. The bacon is cooked amazingly. Personally I'm not a huge fan, but the patries are godlike. Prepare for a very long line also.<//review>

Definitely one of the best breakfast places in town. The chicken sausage was delicious and the serving sizes are huge. You will not regret it.</review>

<text>Great food, and great atmosphere from this place. This was my first stop on my recent trip to the city. It was recommended to us by the staff at the Ritz-Carlton and I have to tell you that they hit the nail on the head.
For those looking for fancy food, this is not the spot. I loved the campy posters of divas from yesteryear. On the walls and the overall nostalgic noir that the place had. Service was very fast, and friendly if not a little rushed. Make sure you spend time eating and enjoying the food and not wasting the time of the servers, or those waiting inline for a table.
Note that the food is served large enough to share, and that's exactly what we did. You can get more refined menus items or just go for the typical grease bomb.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Huge breakfast portions. Lots of egg based and Mexican inspired choices. Reasonably priced. The restrooms were a mess, though.</Text>

<Text>This place is amazing! Went for breakfast on Saturday morning and got there just in the nick of time before the line was wrapping itself out the door. I got the special eggs fritatta with avocado, jalapeño, feta and scallions. Delicious! We also got sides of the cornbread and this blueberry coffee cake. The cornbread was pretty good but it was kinda a weird breakfast item but the coffee cake was AMAZING. This is definitely a place to go check out!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Great food and staff. But they have continual problems with their internet connection and will suddenly announce that they need cash only, so be prepared. My waiter suggested we go to the ATM next door. IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD??? NO WAY…I'd have a dozen homeless on me in two seconds, plus I should not be inconvenienced and charged a fee for the restaurant's lack of addressing this problem. I told them they could take my card number and expiration date, then charge me.< /Review>

Simply speaking, this place DOES NOT live up to the hype AT ALL. After waiting in line for over two hours, we were greeted rather coldly by the staff. The kitchen was extremely slow and the over priced menu did not help at all. We ordered omelettes and pancakes. The food was, to our shock, mediocre. The pancakes were more than slightly burnt, and the hash brown was under cooked and under seasoned. The corn breads were practically bland.< /review>

The menu is a siren's song. Everything LOOKS amazing. Clearly the chef's are working hard to create a unique experience. However, that experience is undermined by lack luster food and, surprisingly, bad service. The bus boys are incredibly hard working but, the waitresses have bad attitudes and are almost incompetent at times.

Not really worth the line, NOW with more drug deals and prostitutes!<//Text>

30 minutes wait but it was worth it.
Must have cinnamon coffee cake and fried egg sandwich. You'll be too full 🙂<//review>

Do not be put off by the location in the dodgy art of town. Good food, worth any wait you may encounter at the front door.  The scrambles are HUGE, split them between 2 people!</Text>

Only after having been there I was told by friends this is one of SF's most popular cafés. I got there by total chance on the word of a street cleaner on an SF morning when I woke up far too early. I got to be the first in line when they opened the doors (the same time I realised the size of the line that formed behind me) and loved the experience and the food that followed.<//review>

Went there only once, more than 10 years ago following a piece of advice from an offline guide (yes, they were printed on paper before the internet rushed in). The waiting queue outside was indeed quite long but I was alone so I got to skip everyone to get a seat at the bar. I really enjoyed this breakfast and remember it fondly.<//Text>

This is the best breakfast in town.  Well worth waiting in the long lines for!  Get there early, though! 7:45 am on a weekend morning may be too late to get a seat right away!</review>

If you don't mind to stay in a long line, you can get a proper American breakfast.<//Text>

This is very well done american diner food, at a reasonable price. They don't serve French bread, they serve Marscapone banana stuffed French bread, served on the same heavy china, in the same large portions, as every diner. The experience is essentially the same as any brunch diner, but with more attention paid to interesting variations on the classic dishes, very fresh ingredients, and quality of preparation (the eggs are never dry, the roast is just at the crunchy stage, ect.).  The mid morning rush always has an hour long line, so go at 10am or after noon, particularly if you are a group.<//text>

I waited an hour and by the time I was seated, I realized that the long line wasn't due to the restaurant being busy.  It was because the servers were slow cleaning up tables.  When I walked in, I saw 4-5 tables vacant.  If the restaurant were a little more efficient, that would shorten the line outside by half at least.

I also sensed a lot people there were tourists.  That was alarming.

I had a whiskey fennel sausage omelet with corn bread.  The food was nothing spectacular.  Coffee was horrible.  My girl friend joked that I make better scrabble.  It was true considered that I'm not even that good of a cook.  I ordered an orange mango muffin to go.  It was ok.  I think Starbucks has better muffin.

Was it worth the wait?  No.  Would I go again?  Hell no.  It's all hype.</Review><Date>1342084270822<//Date><gmap_id>0x80858091d455bc5d:0x867a357594d7793d<//gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp><user_name>Sam Fung<//user_name></record>

My favorite breakfast spot in SF!  The food is excellent and there are plenty of choices.  Note the that portion sizes are pretty big, so go hungry!

The neighborhood is a little rough and the line can tend to be long, but I think it is worth it.<//Text>

<Review>We went on a pretty crowded day, but Dottie's staff should be used to that.  Maybe our waitress was having a bad day or something, but we were ignored almost the entire meal.  We couldn't get the menus, had to flag down someone else to place our order, had to get our own silverware since someone else joined our table late, and then added automatic gratuity on our bill even though we had less than the required number of people.

The service probably influenced how the food tasted, but I wasn't impressed.  There are better options and I won't be coming back to Dottie's anytime soon.</Review>< Pictures>

Breakfast is great.  Is it worth the long lines? Debatable.  Extra charges for things like salsa and jalepeo jam that the wait staff always suggests to pair with your meal; no where on the menu lists these items as extra charge. $2.50 is a bit steep for pico de gallo, even if it's fresh made in house.<//Review>

Food is great, the cafe always has menu suggestions or specials displayed on a chalkboard outside, lines are long on weekends especially between 9am and 11am. Street parking is not easy so you walk, take muni or pay for a garage you also have to know where it's at</review>

<review>I knew about the wait going in but was determined to try it--luckily I wasn't very hungry starting out, but was definitely there by the time I finally got seated. Even at 8:30am or so the line was pretty crazy, but chatting in line with a couple of very nice women from Wisconsin helped pass the time, which ended up being about 45 minutes (I know). I also got to check out their salt and pepper collection window in detail--they seem to have a thing for them. When I was finally called in, I got sat at the counter since I was a singleton, but I didn't mind because I had a nice view of the kitchen. Since I'd also had plenty of time to peruse the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted: the black bean cakes plate with coffee. It came out sooner than I thought it would and it was tasty! They formed black beans into two patties and smothered it in pico de gallo, cheese, and sour cream. I got a side of avocado to put on top as well and it was a delightful southwestern treat.

It was surprisingly quiet inside the restaurant; normally breakfast places seem to be a cacophony of plates and utensils clanging and people talking but it was really calm and mellow, which was great. Alas, I was too full to get one of their baked goodies, which looked really scrumptious. Overall I'm glad I checked it out and if I'm not in a hurry next time I'd love to check it out again!< /review>< pictures>

I was disappointed in my selection, considering the long line (40 mins. For us) I really expected everything to be a homerun. I ordered french toast and they were an underwhelming crumbling dense afaire.  My friend ordered the buttermilk pancakes, those were well balanced and fluffy.  The real maple syrup was a saving grace.  We will give it another go and try alternative dishes at some point but today just didn't hit the mark considering the price and wait.< /Text>

Food was disgusting non ready or burned. French toast and eggs disgusting. Expensive. Nothing for Germans. Don't eat there it's absolutely bad. Old bread old cinemen roll in microwave warmed up. 65 dollar for breakfast. Don't trust other ones. The hype about this is not worth of it. DONT GO THERE. Burn you money will be better.< /text>

<text>This features in many guidebooks as the best place to have breakfast in SF. In my opinion the food's only average, and to get it, you invariably have to spend half an hour queuing in the human zoo that is the Tenderloin, even at 7am. I'd skip this place, and try Canteen a few blocks North.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

Long lines but the selection is enormous and the food is delicious. The new location has sacrificed some of the original charm and attention to detail for a larger dining space and slightly shorter waits but it remains worth the occasional visit.</text>

<review>Where do i begin? The entire experience was indescribably terrible. For a place that was on diners drive-ins and dives i expected this place to be at least decent, dont belive the hype. The person serving us had a terrible attitude when it came to questions and yet has the nerve to think he deserves a tip through automatic tipping. Food was alright for me but for the rest of my group it was downright flavorless. How are you gonna have a side called home-fried potatoes which arent even fried? You call slightly heating some diced potatoes with butter and light herbs is home-fried? Gtfo here with yo flavorless ass's. If you ever think about coming here don't go to jack n' the box and call it a day.

< review>
I cannot believe I will just give it three stars after waiting in line for about 90mins, but I guess this is as high as I can rank for Dottie's. After checking all the amazing reviews on yelp, I managed to persuade my folks to wait in line with me in the chill in the early morning to try the breakfast there. We waited for 1 hour and 15 minutes till we were seated. The staff were very friendly and they kept coming refill our coffee and tea. However, the food were really just average. We had three different kinds of omelets. They were nothing special. I dont know if I expected too much,but I know I would not go there again for sure. After finishing the breakfast, I felt like telling those poor people queuing outside that do not waste their time, they can have the same ones from other places in SF which do not offer chill-in-wind for 1 hour.<//review>

I'm just not impressed. The food was just ok. I ordered the whiskey fennel sausage scramble and my bf had the chipotle ground beef scramble. Mine had more flavor than his but at the end of the day they were both ok. The jalapeño grilled cornbread was pretty good with the jalapeño jelly. The waiter was great hence the 3 stars. We came on a Thursday and waited for less than 30 minutes. All the staff seemed pretty friendly but the food is just ok IMO.< /text>

Although we had to queue for a while to get it (on a Sunday) the food was impossible not to love.

I had poached eggs with pancakes which was huge, along with a very nice Bloody Mary. I highly recommend that combination.< /review>

MMMM Pancakes!

Well my hotel was located around the corner and I asked the conceirage where I should be getting brunch. They laughed to each other and said three doors down on the left.

Little did I know the best part of my hotel was it proximity to dotties.

The pancakes were to die for, which is what you might do waiting in the line! Literally a 2 hour wait. The first time we tried to go, we couldnt we had work!

But like you always hear, good things come to those who wait. We went the next day, at 7 am and still waited in line!

It was delicious though and an experience especially since we found out they were moving the next week, so we were one of the last to get the true dotties experience (waiting in line!)

If the lines were shorter we would have eaten there every morning!

Prices were right and the service was great.</Text>

The good:
- the food is very excellent
- the menu is comprehensive and varied
- the prices are reasonable
- the portions are massive
- once you've made your order the food turns up very quickly

The bad:
- there's no wifi
- the neighbourhood is unpleasant
- the queue is epic. I got there 10 minutes after opening time (7.39 on a Saturday morning) and had to wait a few minutes to be seated. People who get there any later than that should bring a book to read.
- if you make the mistake of sitting facing the queue you'll feel guilty and rush your meal

You should try Dottie's at least once but Honey Honey is an equivalent experience a few blocks away without the epic queue and unpleasant neighbourhood.< /review>

How do you not have any alternative options for those that do not eat pork? This was an absolute waste of money and time. Was tempted to walk out after I ordered, but it took forever to get here.< /text>

Had to wait for 2.5 hours to be sited. We went there after reading reviews. But was thoroughly disappointed. Food was mediocre at best. Server was impolite.< /text>

Worth the (inevitable) wait. Don't miss the chili-cheddar corn bread with pepper jelly. Or one of the bakery specials. Or the pancakes. All the carbs.< /review>

Expensive, food not really good, they have a rule of not saving number of seats unless there is present everyone there, meaning if you have a date, and you need a table of 2 they will let everyone else cut you until your date comes</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Arrived at 10 in the morning, it was over the corner, and it took about 40 minutes to get in.
The food is not fast, and the food portions are large. Unfortunately, the signature whiskey sausage will soon be gone, so I will not eat it. People who want to eat should go to the queue early.

(Translated by Google) I heard from the locals that there would be a line, so I aimed for it right after the store opened.
You can dine in a nice space by renovating an old building.
I had banana and raspberry rice flour pancakes!

<Review>(Translated by Google) We loved the place with brick walls, chandelier ... Warm atmosphere.
We were there around 7:30 on a Sunday in April, there were already a few people waiting for tables.
It's very copious, the muffins are huge and falling! Good pancakes.
I recommend, plus they are very friendly ... Anyway with us hehe.
Do not hesitate but come early, it's better ...

Je recommande, en plus ils sont très aimables... En tout cas avec nous hehe.

When you are on your way out, hang on to your staff. You do not have to give me a menu order. I do not want you to give me a breakup. Gibben. I will not let you go. I'll come after you. I'll go to my forehead. You're gonna crack the mule.

<Text>(Translated by Google) ⚠️ From the conclusion, the worst store of life ⚠️
Objectively the taste is mediocre.
These rude employees are my first time in my life.
I did not want to drink but I did not want to continue to notice that I finally let the drink.
Several times, the staff swam around at our table.
At the end, he seemed to be taking us for another table receipt.
I asked him to check the receipt, and he gave me the receipt for our table in his pocket as if I had waited.

⚠️결론부터 말하면 인생 최악의 가게⚠️
객관적으로 맛은 평범합니다.
이런 무례한 직원들은 난생 처음입니다.
음료먹을 생각은 없었는데 안시키니까 눈치를 계속 줘서 결국 드링크까지 시켰다.
몇 차례나 직원들끼리 우리 테이블을 보며 속닥거렸다.
마지막엔 일부러 다른 테이블 영수증을 주며 우리를 농락하는 듯 했습니다.
영수증 체크를 부탁했더니 기다렸다는 듯이 주머니에 있던 우리 테이블 영수증을 줬다.<//Text><UserId.>108561129714343359741</UserId.><user_name>Hyun yii</user_name>< Rating>

L'accueil est toujours agréable et le service souriant. Nous n'avons jamais fait la queue en semaine et/ou hors saison.< /review>

<time>1570928249154< /time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) In the morning, I saw a lot of queues and waited for at least half an hour. We have three people, but they are taken into the store by the one-person group, the two-person group, and the three-person group. I don’t know why the treatment is different, or don’t eat it.

早上的時候過去，看到排隊人數不少，等候至少半小時。我們有三個人，卻被後面的一人組、兩人組、三人組先帶位進入店內，不懂為何待遇不同，還是別來吃了</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Spectacular breakfast! I ordered bacon with scrambled eggs, potatoes and french toast ... Delicious! And a lot of quantity in the dishes. The waiters are very friendly, attentive and serve fast.

We had to do a 45 minute queue at the door until we had a table, so be patient.

As a downside I would say that the tables are a bit small for the size of the dishes.

In total we paid $ 65.

(Original)
Espectacular desayuno! Pedí bacon con huevos revueltos, patatas y french toast... Delicioso! Y mucha cantidad en los platos. Los camareros son muy amables, atentos y sirven rápido.

Tuvimos que hacer unos 45 minutos de cola en la puerta hasta tener mesa, así que tened paciencia.

Como pega diría que las mesas son un poco pequeñas para el tamaño de los platos.

En total pagamos 65$.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I asked if I'd like to drink coffee as soon as I went in. It's about $ 3 per cup. Pancakes and French toast are just like that. ㅎㅎ Value for money. ㅎㅎ The atmosphere is good :)

들어가자마자 커피 마실거냐고 묻는데 잔당 3달러 정도고요, 리필해주니 둘이서 한잔 시키는 것도 방법일 것 같네요. 팬케이크랑 프렌치 토스트는 그냥 그래요. ㅎㅎ 가격대비 맛은.. 특별함 없는 투박한 맛입니다. ㅎㅎ 분위기는 좋아요:)</text>

There are hundreds of places with the same or better quality in the city but less media.
