Could not imagine a better place for a drink after coming over on a bike from Hayward than Boba Bliss! Wonderfully attentive service that handled all my questions enthusiastically and professionally. I’m a big Thai tea fan so when I saw they have a variation of it, I had to try it! It looked like Matcha but definitely tasted different in a very delightful way! Indeed, floral and refreshing. The pearls were the perfect texture as well. They definitely earn their reputation! :-)< /Review>

<Review>I love this place! I wish it was closer to me but it was worth the 30 minutes drive. I ordered online and the time slots were perfect for me. There's an estimated time for when the drinks were ready but it was faster than the estimated time. There was someone outside who helped with giving out orders and I think that was great. I was worried because the drinks were already done and I didn't pick them up for another 10+ minutes and the biggest thing about that is usually the ice. I decided not to drink them until I got home since the ice already started melting. I ordered the Strawberry Milk Bar and the Mango Dream 2.0 and they were soooo good! This is definitely one of my favorite boba places. I've tried most of the drinks on the menu and everything is pretty darn good.<//Review>< rate>

< Review>
This is my favorite Boba place in the Bay Area and I've tried a lot.. great seasonal drinks and their regular drinks are always consistent and yummy. I love supporting this Asian women-owned small business run by sisters. When the pandemic hit they quickly found a way to make ordering easier online and have a great pick up system. No more waiting in line! They also take the time and effort to support frontline healthcare workers and the Asian community.</Review>

<Name>Erica Moreno< /Name><review>Boba Bliss is one of my favorite places for boba in the entire Bay Area. I like how they use real ingredients, offer dairy alternatives, customizations for most drinks, and their drinks taste good! I can taste the care and craft that goes into their drinks. Also, the owners are so friendly. They take the time to get to know their customers, and you can tell the locals keep coming back because of that connection. They are very popular, even now with COVID-19 restrictions.
My usual favorites are their milk teas and matcha drinks. This past summer, they introduced a matcha taro latte on their menu which has been my go-to order every time.<//review>< gmapID>

<text>The lady was screaming at people to get back to their cars and telling everyone that they'll have a text when the order is ready. I came back after waiting 25 minutes for a single drink only to find out the drink has long been done and sitting there. Long enough for the ice to be melted and has formed a layer of water on top. Seriously, either find a way to ensure you have the customers info to notify them, or don't go telling everyone to go back to their cars. If I didn't walk back to check in on my order, I would have never gotten the drink. Call out order numbers like everyone else does, or figure out a better way notify people.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><time>1612652825024< /time><gmap_id>0x808fedd10b2bf6db:0x35fe8de2c49e285<//gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1612662888881, 'text': 'Unfortunately this isn’t reflecting the truth.

<Review>Love the cold brew coffee milk tea here! Wish I could tell you about the other drinks, but I like this drink so much, that I haven't ordered anything else. :) Also, other than some hiccups as they were ramping up online ordering, I think they did a great job adhering to the restrictions while still serving their customers.<//Review></record>

And as we all know, ice is nothing but a scam unless your drink was not in a refrigerator which it always is(:<//Review></record>

<text>We often come here to get our boba drinks. Our favorite is the Chocolate Cookie Puff Cream. It tastes so good, super creamy, the boba is perfect to its chewiness. Our kids love it too. The ingredients are organic so we know we are taking great quality ingredients. Their online ordering is very convenient especially during these times.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>The drinks here are very good and high quality. They are done well and thoughtfully and the flavors blend well together. If you drink enough boba tea drinks, you can tell when the flavors don’t work well and when the tea to water to cream ratio is off. Yes flavors are subjective and everybody has a different take on different places, but I personally think this is one of the top boba places in the Bay.

From the fruit tea (no cream), to the milk tea, to the fresh milk (no caffeine), all of it was very good.</review>< Pics>

One of my fave boba shops in the Bay Area! It’s a hidden Jen, I’ve been to so many boba shops in the US, Taiwan, Asia, and yet this one always comes out to be the winner. They have consistently made delicious brown sugar and have a variety of drinks with fresh purées not store bought which makes it extra delicious. If you’re still hesistant, don’t! It’s worth the trip and try.<//Review>

<Review>I loved their taro Matcha latte! Fresh taro lovers who like matcha would love this genius combo. I also love how their thai tea is strong in flavor.
The staff was so nice and welcoming as well.
Right now for COVID procedures you order at their table and they take your number and give you a call while you wait outside in your car.
It's a bit of a drive for me but I definitely would come back for their taro Matcha latte and other seasonal drinks.< /Review>< Rating>

Ah I honestly love Boba Bliss's Cold Brew Coffee!

I'm not a coffee person, but this coffee hits all the right spots! I feel WIDE awake as soon as I drink it and I don't become a jittery mess.

I'm also a big fan of their online ordering system! It's efficient, accurate, and safe! I'm impressed with how streamlined the whole process is :)<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>It was so shocking that until recently we didn't give boba bliss a chance, given we live less than 10 minutes away. They are currently taking online orders via their website (no delivery, just takeout), and some orders in person. They follow covid social distancing and masking protocols and manage it pretty well. They are chewy and sweet with their honey boba, and I like that they sell agar boba (also known as crystal boba at other places). If you're in the mood for better quality boba, I recommend this location to Boba Boys. For their drinks, they use real taro (love!!!) and I can really taste the tea. Since the drink sizes look larger here, I think their prices might also be better than the boba boys. We're certainly going to be back a lot, and glad to support a family-owned local company!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fedd10b2bf6db:0x35fe8de2c49e285<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I got a Matcha Brown Sugar Pearl Latte. It was very creamy and not too bitter. The brown sugar boba gives is a low sweet flavor that balances out the bitterness from the matcha. It was a nice drink for an overcast day. Their drinks are always good here. Ive never had a bad drink.

Right now you can't enter the building and they encourage you to order ahead online to prevent too much of a line from forming. The staff there were very patient and communicated well even though they were busy. Good job guys! Keep it up!< /Text>< Pics>

Was recommended by my brother-in-law. First time here and the line was out the door! We had the chance to try their Creme Brulee Pearl Latte, Strawberry Matcha Latte (better than Boba guys), and Natural Taro Ube Latte. I normally judge other boba spots by their boba and milk tea; this one is so good!! I am not a big taro fan, so I took a sip just to try it and it was tasty! the fresh taro topping is a must order. The Creme Brulee Pearl Latte is to die for! MUST ORDER! It definitely makes the drink tastes like a dessert. YUM! Wish they had one closer to home! You can also adjust your sugar and ice levels. The lines are manageable and moved fairly quickly. No issues with parking as it shares a huge parking lot with other businesses.  Looking forward to the next time I can stop by again!<//Review>< pics>

<text>Awesome and friendly customer service!!
We actually came here a few weekends ago on a Saturday evening when it was packed and had a spill when arriving home!
We ordered to-go:  Creme Brûlée, chocolate Cookies puff, Strawberry Milk Bar, and Strawberry Matcha Latte.  We were told that the paper carrier was thin and they were ordering thicker ones so she advised to be careful.  Unfortunately for us, when walking from the car to our front door, there were 3 drinks in the carrier and the handle broke.  Since two of our drinks had the non-sealed top, they didn’t survive the fall.  I did like the Strawberry Matcha and Strawberry Milk with Oatly.  We’ve had Boba Guys Strawberry Matcha and their Strawberry Rice Milk.

So fast forward to this morning and I wanted a re-do to makeup for that.... I asked the ladies if they could seal the Creme brûlée and Chocolate Cookie Puff Creme.  I told the story and they offered a discount which was awesome!  When the drinks were ready they gave me a carton carrier and a bag to hold the sealed ones.  Very nice customer service!!!
I got the Tropical Passion Tea with lychee jelly this time instead of the Strawberry Matcha.  It had passion fruit (of course), slices of apple, pineapple, orange.
The Creme brûlée had a nice layer of custard and Creme.  The chocolate Cookie puff was also good according my 10yo.
They have honey boba and agar boba but we prefer the honey one and it was nice sweet and chewy.

Will definitely return to try their other drinks.  But will avoid busy times because when busy, layout is hard to sit down with the line crowd.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Boba Bliss is our go-to place when we need a boba fix. Their ingredients are spot on and their boba are soft compared to other boba places we’ve tried. Due to COVID-19, they have limited hours but we we were able to order drinks (8 orders at a time) several times during past three weeks through their website bobablisscafe.com. You will receive a text when your order is ready for curbside pick up. They are very efficient and will accommodate your requests when they can. I just wish they are able to credit customer’s loyalty account when you order online.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvym8Bgy5TZHIqvFfQlGsRR2X9s-Y0Mnyx8w1g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMx3oVh_RZAqLLO6_q2BqfzDlXB0HFf_4g_Yo1g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Manager still took care of me being sold out driving all the way from Fairfield which became the norm for us getting their boba since. Can't beat their natural flavors. Always worth the drive. I would recommend trying all their drinks, wouldn't disappoint. Their service is tops plus the the drinks being good, I just wished they were closer to home.</text></record>

<Name>Kevin Le<//Name><time>1602281034797</time><rate>5<//rate><text>The mango-dream 2.0 is so-slap-in-the-face good and flavorful.  Each cup is not too sweet, well-balanced and has these coconut jelly silkiness thingies that is highly addictive.  Even my picky mom in her 60’s, who is a picky eater, with diabetes; love it.  Yummy!  Just take my money — you deserve it!

Very fresh and delicious drinks!  I hate boba tea that has a chemical, syrup-based or powdery after-taste you usually find at chain boba stores.  The drinks at Boba Bliss tastes very natural.  It gives your taste buds the happy feeling that only drinks made from real and scratch ingredients can only give.

My next favorite is the taro ube,... not sweet and very flavorful.  The strawberry matcha is also a contender,... the puree is divinely delicious and fresh tasting.  Highly recommend.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7m1CRlAWEL4fs4Jsk2Ht3MZan_XBdmEAGtgvL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>Ordered the strawberry matcha latte with oak milk and the Creme brulee latte. The Creme brulee is on the sweet side. But I still highly recommend both drinks. the line looked long but it went by pretty quickly. there are outlets close to the tables and there is free wifi. would definitely come back if I happen to be in the area.< /Review>< username>

I was suprised with the small menu but keeping it simple makes the choices quite hard to choose from. The flavor was very soft and very flavorful! Thank you guys !</text>

Hello everyone. I recommend you to go to this boba tea shop because it tastes good and service is the fastest. I recommend this place for adult and kids to go to idk how to right review cuz me is young. Plus this is off topic but take this seriously: STOP ONLINE DATING<//Review>

<review>I thought you couldn't get better than boba guys, but this place is wonderful. When my family wants a pick-me-up, we come here. Our personal favorites are their strawberry matcha latte (as good, if not better, than boba guys) and their green thai tea. But everything here we've tried is excellent, and we love that they can adjust to our tastes.

It's tough for a boba place to get over 4 stars, so their ratings say a lot!< /review>< user_id>

<review>Specialties here are all pretty good!  The drinks also have a lower sweetness at 100% than other places you may be used to.  I recommend the creme brulee latte for a sweet treat(like a dessert).  The taro drink also has the real stuff if you know what I mean.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Love the creme brulee!  We showed up at closing time and girl, I  think she's the owner or manager, was sweet enough to say "if you've come this far, we will make a drink for you."  Customer service is excellent. All the young women have been trained well and are very nice.   They even say welcome back! Five stars!<//review></record>

Super fresh! It is the most different Boba I've ever had, but it's EXCELLENT! The Boba pearls themselves are perfect! Just the right amount of sweet and the perfect texture. We tried the creme brulee and brown sugar and both were incredible! They do use real cream, it's rich, so make sure you have room for essentially a dessert haha. We will definitely be returning!</review>

Got the strawberry Milk bar:
Absolutely amazing; very delicious

Pro:
- sweetness is just right( not too bitter, no too sweet)
- Boba is perfect ( squishy and chewy)
- Similar to boba guys( another tea place)

Neg:
- price for quali-tea is a bit pricy<//review>

<Review>Love it here. My 5 year old son dropped his drink on accident and employees were kind enough to make him another. It was a learning lesson for him. We helped clean up the mess and I showed him that no one was making fun of him or getting mad. This is now his favorite spot 😂<//Review>< gmap_id>

Incredibly friendly service to accompany really tasty drinks. The creme brulee was outstanding (it came with serving instructions!), and one can tell they pride themselves on the quality: the manager emphasized their drinks are handmade with real ingredients instead of syrups.< /Text>

Wow!! That creme brûlée drink is to die for!!! These guys were super busy but each drink has all these handcrafted details with special packaging. The creme brûlée comes with a special tiny spoon so you can crack and taste the top of the custard before mixing it into your  beverage. So yummy.< /review>

The best boba I have had. Their caramel brulee boba is amazing. Even the honey boba is awesome. It’s a must try for boba fans. It’s always crowded.< /Review>

Great new boba place that replaced tea factory. I had my reservations about it since there are so many new boba places but, from the two times I've been there, it has been very solid. I had the Jasmine milk tea the first time and it had a great Jasmine tea flavor. I thought it was a tad too milky for me but fine otherwise. The boba is also good. It has a nice chew and isn't too sweet. The next visit, I got the strawberry matcha latte and I have to say, it's at least as good as boba guys. The strawberry puree in it was great and paired well with the matcha. I'll definitely be back.

On a side note, they do have a variety of milk substitutes. They include almond and the increasingly popular, oat milk. The milk substitutes don't cost more which is very nice of them.< /Text>

Staff was friendly- greeted us upon entering, bright clean and modern setting.  Ordered two strawberry milk bars with honey boba and a cheese cream oolong with honey boba.

1. Great customer service
2. 15% off drinks for soft opening (woot)
3. Generous with their honey boba!
4. My boys loved their Strawberry milk bars- said it was “yummy and the honey boba is awesome.”
5. Honey boba had the perfect balance of soft and chewy with a subtle sweetness
6. Oolong tea was smooth, cream cheese ever so slightly salty

Will definitely be back to try the creme brûlée’ boba! ❤️</Review><name>Alicia Wong</name><GmapID>0x808fedd10b2bf6db:0x35fe8de2c49e285</GmapID>< Pictures>

<review>Rude! Rude! Rude! Called in to ask about making an appointment to restore my name. I previously sent in my documents to another office that stated I didn’t send in all my documents which I DID! The woman on the phone had so much base in her voice like my predicament was impeding on her day. Every time I asked a question regarding what needs to be sent in exactly because I’m not going to keep sending in all my records and legal documents; “well I don’t know ma’am.” Then why are you on the phone!?<//review><user>110310680720570138702</user>< Rating>

I'm giving 4 stars because, for me, anyplace I have to wait is unpleasant. For what it's worth, though, it was alright. Customer service was cool and the place was nice and clean. There are public bathrooms and, even though the parking structure for this office isn't finished yet, there is STILL parking available left and right here. There's even a valet, but not sure if you have to pay. There's a bunch of vending machines and all! If you have kids, though, they're pretty strict, (the officers), when it comes to wild-running-all-over-the-place-kids!<//text>

I had read  reviews that it was a long  wait but I'm  happy to say I was in and out in 20 mins. I changed my name and it was super fast. Only had 2 ppl ahead of me when I  sat. I actually think I waited longer to get checked by security at entrance than the actual wait time  of process. This was on a Wednesday so idk if that  might have contributed to short  wait.<//Review>

The employees are so rude.. they kept me sitting here at the desk after mynumber was called for an hour and half.. while they were in the back. Then she came back and told me that she couldn't reinstate my bennifits,although I had everything I was suppose to have.when I asked her name she wouldn't give me that information.< /Review>

<text>First time here.. You come in and you have to unload everything from your pockets into a bin so that it can be scanned and then you gotta go through a metal detector .. There's a self check in computer with many languages,  you will get a receipt with a letter and number and just wait for it to be called ( i was aprox. 1hr and 30min waiting)  service and info was nice after that ..you may also make an appointment online if you make an account.. But you must come in person and wait if its your first time applying for the SSA.</text><rating>4< /rating>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Now this is a awesome and wonderful place good and down to earth people. The homeless calls the place The Hippie Kitchen and let me tell you that name fits the place. Because all of the volunteers dress like your good down to earth loving hippie. The food is real tasty and good you have too go and see for yourself.</Review>

We went to Gilberth's after an opening at the Museum of Craft + Design and loved our food.  It was tasty and innovative, and our waiter was charming and helpful.  I would definitely go back!!<//text>

It's a little dive place.  The people are locales.  They are nice. The food is good. It is in the wholesale district.  Unfortunately there are homeless people near by.<//text>

Good food, cheap, and not as greasy as one would think of a "greasy spoon" type place. She makes a good plate, and its clean.< /Review>

Cool little spot in dogpatch. Dinner, drinks and service was excellent. Had some spicy poke, tacos and a glass of rose.  Best to go early or rsvp early as it gets busy if doing a late dinner.   Would love to try the roasted shishito peppers next time, our table next to us had it and it look so yummm!< /Review>

Probably 15 years since I had a Dominos Pizza so I ordered a small just in case I didn't like it. What a pleasant surprise!!! The order was ready at the requested time and packaged so it was piping hot when I got home. The most important component is the bread and Dominos nailed it. Ended up wanting more for breakfast next day. I'm going back soooooon!</text>

Wow, I just read the reviews of this place.  I've always ordered online and never had a problem.  Every time I go in it is like everyone is where they need to be in the assembly line.  I will take the previous reviews into account next time and see if I notice anything out of the ordinary.<//Review>

< review>
Service at this place was horrible. Ordered for pick up. Got there and the place was closed. People were inside, knocked on the window to see what was going on they didnt acknowledged me. Later someone came out to ask who was next, cause other people were there, too. They have there doors locked. They only peek out the door to get your name, take your money n give the pizza. One thing the pizza was good service awful and weird.< /review>

Decent, but I'd prefer Pizza Hut over this place.
Both are equally good, but Hut delivers on time, and without error.< /Review>

<text>Twice! I have called to place an order 30 minutes before they close twice. The first time a rude women answered and told me that she would not deliver to me because they were closed. They weren't. I called to another on and they happily filled my order. The second time they wouldn't even pick up the phone. If your hours until 12a do you job!

< Review>
Employees don't seem to care about helping their paying customers, in fact they would rather come across as overworked and feeling sorry for themselves. Not surprising, seems like typical self-centered OC residents. Very annoying and very dissatisfied with their service, which is too bad because I do enjoy their pizza.</Review>

< Review>
Worst Domino's ever!
First, I was told it would be up to an hour for a delivery, okay, I get it , it's the 4th of July at 10:30 PM.
But then the guy comes back and tells me they aren't delivering anymore tonight because it's too busy!?<//Review>

Dominos customer service is profoundly heinous with an atmosphere of mediocrity and foul attitude. Never making the mistake to order from such savages at the dominos in dana point.< /text>

wow! this place is beyond ridiculous. I called for delivery and the lady was extremely rude, had an attitude and didnt care that they were going to lose a customer. I cant believe this place is still open. And everyone there barely speaks english. When I asked to speak to a manager, she would'nt put anyone on. I will never try to order from this place again and neither will any of the roomates in my house. we were all in shock at how rude this lady was.
I went on to order from Papa Johns and had no problem. Great service and excellent food. I do suggest that place.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS DOMINOS.

This place was clean, with great site lines to the kids. A nice toddler play structure for my 14 month old. I would definitely go back.</Review>

<Review>Love this park.  The only wish I have would be some shade over thr play structures.  It's apparent that a lot of thought went into the design as it accommodates so many age groups and abilities.  The picnic areas are awesome and so much green space to accommodate running.  Lots of paved path for my nearly 2 year old granddaughter to ride her scooter - she LOVES this park!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

They remodeled this park and it's great.  With rubber matting and about 20 different things kids can climb, bounce, rock, and slide on.  Bonus there are 3 musical instruments to play with.  Lots of trees and 4 park tables.<//Text>

Great park.  Excellent play area for the kids, nice share from surrounding trees.  Nice barbecue setups with picnic tables (2 barbecue areas).

Could really use a bathroom or Porta potty (would give it 5 stars)<//review>

<review>Took my grandson and daughter to this park which all my children played at as small children. They have a few good trees for photos there. There were tiny little miniature pinecones. This park is nice and usually you are all alone there. Clean. Fun. I recommend it for a fun afternoon. There's shade and good choices for playground equipment, picnic tables, water fountain. Nice park.</review><Resp>None</Resp><Rating>4< /Rating>< Time>

Cute park BUT needs MORE shade as equipment can get hot and there are NO BATHROOMS! Not sure why they didn’t put in a bathroom when this has been one of the request of parents of Livermore and don’t understand why they didn’t add more shade 🤷🏼‍♀️<//Text>

<review>This is a very nice neighborhood park with children's playground equipment set up in a pirate theme. There are a few large trees for shade and lots of lawn. There are picnic tables and barbecue pits. It has plenty of parking and you can enter the park from two different streets. Overall it is a very nice park to bring the kids to use the equipment or just play in the grass.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>My sister and I went today to the Arvin nail salon to get pedicures & did not like the service. When I was getting my pedicure the guy was not friendly or clean. Then as he was almost done I noticed there was a roach on the ground next to me. He acted like he could not see it. In which it was clearly in plain view. He literally picked it up with his bare hand & threw it in the trash then continued to touch up my nails. The most disgusting thing ever he did is not wash his hands. Then when i payed him I need change for a $100. He gave me my change & stood right in front of me staring at me expecting a tip. My sister was also asked for a tip twice for a wax & pedicure from the old lady that works there. Never been to a place where they ask for a tip. You should earn your tip not ask for it. They need to go back to school for training and proper sanitation.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating><time>1530661672798<//time>< user>

Ive been doing my nails there for a long time and the last time i went the guy was very rude he would tell me how to position my  hand he would grab it very harsh. I told him to be more careful because he cut me twice and he got mad.He was new there because it was my first time seeing him there .</review>

<Review>I will never go back when I first went I like how attentive they were but now it seems they do their job for the money,I had been going since December/2016 until now I had a terrible job done on my nails.I asked to have french manicure & fills, so the only lady there did my nails she did not even refill my nails she started taking the nail color I had & polish my nails after that she put a clear color & a white color on the tip my nail I notice that you could see throu the clear nail the previous fills(lines) on my nails so I told her she got mad & told me that "what do you want me to do thats your nail" and I just told her nevermind thats fine but honestly she made me feel really bad how she treated me,in my mind I was just thinking I will never come again, to cover the lines she put a clear sprinkle polish to try cover the lines, Im not a demanding person but Im paying for this service I could spend $25 on something else.Also the point was that I wanted french manicure not whatever she wanted to do on my nails. One more thing I one of my nails chip and I thought she was going to fix it but she didnt I just did not said anything because if she got mad when I mention the lines from the previous fills I just let it go seriously I was very disapointing.Never going back I hope my feedback helps.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< Rate>

Service is rude , people don’t know how to do nails they leave them all uneven I had to even show the guy how to file them down straight he just couldn’t do it they had to come help him every once in a while I asked for a specific color and got something way different he took about 3 hours for something so simple that he couldn’t do right .< /text>

Underrated, I feel like this pace should be busier. The food was bomb (I got tacos & my friend got nachos) the chicken was done well & the happy hour made our meal with 1 drink $10 bucks. The actual venue is clean & has an industrial feel (I remember when it was Bridges) and I feel the service was just overall better. I was impressed to be honest as it was my first time coming here as "Social Tap".</review>

A new experience for me. I went during the daytime during happy hour for a light meal with a friend. The food was tasty and there is a wide  variety of appetizers on the menu. The bar offers specialty drinks. The service is excellent.< /text>

Went here for happy hour and it was a great atmosphere. The food was good and the selection of drink were great. I had very attentive service and I plan on trying to come here regularly to see how the nightlife is.< /Review>

<text>Love the food here. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. I'm told that after football season ends the weekend special is $15 bottomless mimosas. Does it get any better than that??</text>< userid>

Good food, but not necessarily great service. Make sure you sit in a prominent place on a slow day so you can get the waiters' attention easily. Despite the lacking service, the food is great (wings and truffle fries especially) and I'll definitely be back.< /Text>

I really want to like this place, but it's so inconsistent . When it's not busy here the service and food are amazing. But if there's a boxing or UFC fight night going on it gets super packed and the quality of the food goes wayyy down. Came here about a week ago and they recently downsized the menu...like super minimized it. Even their alcohol selection diminished. They had a fabulous shrimp Cobb salad that I was sad to see go.
I wonder what their end game is with this.<//Review>

Almost $12 for a basic auto wash? The owner of this station is a crook. Completely unacceptable and totally taking advantage of people. These auto wash car washes have never been more than $6-7 for the basic wash.
Next time I'll go across the street to Shell or elsewhere.</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Absolutely amazing! My new favorite bubble tea location! My husband and I went here for the first time last weekend and met the owner who was absolutely lovely! She spent 5 minutes walking us through the menu, her restaurant experience, and her plans for an outdoor patio (when I went again yesterday the patio was set up and it looked very nice)! The service is amazing and I would rate the flavor of the tea and the fresh honey boba 10/10 if that was allowed! The gentleman who helped me yesterday around 4pm was very kind and made the drinks quickly!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Luxe Boba & Tea Co is an EXCELLENT Boba place away from the hustle & bustle of Convoy St! It's literally 5 minutes from our front door! Our son loves the popcorn chicken & calamari & curly fries compared to Boba Time. Only downside is it gets CROWDED. It's worth the wait and the customer service is outstanding despite the wait. Check out Luxe!< /review>

I’m completely sold on the Boba King Kong Tea! The atmosphere is awesome along with the lights and music!

The only negative is:
Why don’t you hire more people in order to move the line much faster?

As Personally observed, I waited over 20 minutes to get one boba, Popcorn chicken and fries. I don’t mind waiting as it’s always good......

Issue: There was only 1 girl working as a cashier..... I decided to take a stroll while waiting for my order.... I walked past the back door of their restaurant which was open & you could see through the screen-door,  I noticed the employee chatting to an older man sitting just near the stockroom exit.

Area of improvement: attention manager, supervisor/owner > why is their no sense of urgency meeting the needs of your customers? Why is an employee sitting in the back stock room and not helping move the line?<//Text>

This local boba tea shop has become a new favorite of mine to visit! I first learned about it because of a BTS cupsleeve event that was hosted there, and have been visiting ever since.

I’m still new to boba/tea so I can’t really compare the drink qualtiTEA (haha get it? Quality? Quali-tea? Never mind). However, I can comment on the staff and interior!

The staff are very friendly and helpful if you don’t know what to order! Service is quick, too. I always tip :)

The interior (and exterior) are BEAUTIFUL. It’s a shame that indoor seating isn’t available yet, because I can imagine this being such a cool, fun place to chill with my friends. Or even just to chill and study! The decor is super pretty and they have some fun photo op spots inside and outside (like the greenery bush wall, the logo painted wall, etc). Props to whoever decorated this place!

Oh, It’s also VERY clean - Inside and out. I can tell that The staff here are very conscious of maintaining cleanliness of the space - which is appreciated.

Attached is a photo of a drink I’m trying today. It’s this “aloha” one with mango and other fruity flavors. It normally comes with fruit bits, but I asked them to add lychee jelly and basil seeds (something I learned I really liked after my last drink!).< /Text>

<userid>111276956218589796335</userid><review>This place took over the former Saigon Bliss Pho restaurant. We were saddened because we wanted to get pho and then boba. But glad to know it runs in the same family since the Pho was owned by the mother and now the daughter owns the boba. She’s super nice and friendly when taking our order.

The menu and concept reminds me of boba shops in Orange County due to the drink flavors, serving snacks, and concept. Unlike other SD tea shops that are Taiwanese/Chinese, I am happy that we have a Vietnamese inspired shop that offers flavors like durian, penny worth, sugar cane, pandan, mung bean, etc. I also love that the menu offers picture with description and not just a list of names and you don’t know what to order.

We got Mr. Bean which was a mix of mung bean and infused with pandan leaves along with crystal boba. The texture is there but not as rich if I were to compare it to my favorite place in OC but it’s just as good because of the infused pandan which probably took away that mung bean richness but overall, two thumbs up. I’m also not a fan of boba but decided to keep it original to stick with the crystal boba. Which is way better than regular black boba since it’s like crunchy jelly not chewy starch.

We also got Jade which is Hokkaido milk tea with crystal boba and butterfly pea tea. This drink has caffeine, you can taste the strong tea and it’s legit. We got no boba for this drink.

She didn’t ask me but the person before requested their sugar level to be half sweet. So that’s a suggestion if you want to adjust your sugars and perhaps ice level. I kept it normal for my first time to see how the original tasted before any adjustments.

We ordered popcorn chicken, chicken wings, and dynamite fries. You get the most bang for your buck with pop corn chicken, it’s a large portion. The wings came with 6 so it’s like $1 a piece. I got spicy but it tasted like it wasn’t even mild. Although it was nicely breaded and meaty. The dynamite shoe string fries was yummy but the sriracha and spicy Mayo was only squirted on top and not evenly throughout underneath. So once you finish the top layer, the rest is just the saltiness and furikake. Still good but I would recommend to scatter evenly throughout. My favorite would be the pop corn chicken.

I wish there was outdoor tables for dining. Inside is available for sit down. Outside is just a white ottoman.

We came before sun down and the place started to transform from day to night as they rolled out the VIP red velvet rope and turned on the LED neon lights, club-like environment.

In my opinion, Luxe is comparable to OC boba shops and now we don’t have to drive 1.5 hours for quality drinks.</review></record>

Service is on par if not better than the drinks, and we come for the drinks and the snacks. I ordered an Asian bomb, but I must have been heard as "king kong" through my mask so I received the wrong drink. They fixed the situation immediately and I got to try a king kong, which I will get now too.</Review>

Drinks are solid, but unless you want to wait an hour and a half for a drink, solid pass. Shop is extremely understaffed and disorganized in getting drinks out in order. Cute aesthetic, but a lot of work needs to be done on the customer service side.< /Text>

Finally found a Boba spot here in SD!! I’m only here for a temporary job and have to stay here in SD for a while. I found all the restaurants/spots I could ever want but for the longest time, I had a hard time finding a boba spot! Look no further than Luxe Boba and Teaco!! Not an overwhelming menu as far as drinks and snacks go (which is how I like it), but the stuff they do have is bomb! You can’t go wrong with any of their boba/snacks! A little further from where I am (Campo) but it’s worth the drive! Friendly service, quick, and tasty drinks and snacks!< /Text>

Drinks aren't too bad. Crystal boba is like a gelatin and not boba.  The dynamite fries were good but I wish the topping reached the bottom fries.< /review>

Got the sweetie(durian milk tea), the mr.bean(mung bean), and the popcorn chicken. I love how the drinks were not overly sweet. I usually have to ask for 50% sugar at most boba places. Mr.bean felt a bit more grainy and thicker compared to the mung bean drink from seven leaves, but it's still pretty good. The popcorn chicken was tender and juicy!  Would definitely make the drive back here for the mung bean drink.</text>

Tried almost every milk tea and they are all delicious and not too sweet like most places. The boba options are amazing, crystal boba has a crunch, I just happen to love.

Bora bora - if you always drink milk tea everywhere else but need a little twist.

Sweetie - if you feel adventurous, made with duran milk.

Must get the fried tofu with the sweet chili sauce, yum! The popcorn chicken is great too.

And the best part, the drinks are $5 each!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Decided to check this place out since we live up the street and its open later than most places around.
We had seen it prior to the opening so we couldn't wait for it to open!
My husband got the Starboy drink that came with actual star shaped boba pieces. I got the Panda drink with boba and it was so good! We also got the dynamite fries and they were delicious and had an extra spicy kick. The owner came to talk to us while we were waiting and was very charming and outgoing!
It was super clean inside and has a nice menu, not overwhelming 👌  we will definetly be returning</Review>

<Text>New to the area and decided to take my family for some boba tea. The lady at the counter was super helpful explaining the different flavors and all the unique drinks have pictures along with their descriptions which is super helpful.

I had the King Kong which comes super loaded with toppings and a great black tea flavor that wasn’t overshadowed. My wife had a taro milk tea that was a little too sweet for me but she loved it. My daughter had the Candy Cane with boba which she wasn’t a fan of the type of boba she got and the owner instant made her a new to her liking. My sons had the strawberry milk tea and the honeydew milk tea and were very happy.

All for $5 each, I believe it was well worth it. I did not get to try any of their food because we were still full from lunch earlier but I will be looking forward to going back again and try some more menu items, especially after the lady was telling us how she used to be the owner of the restaurant formerly there I am sure with her lovely attitude for food will be just as good.  Looking forward to trying more unique teas such as their durian topped tea.<//Text>< Pics>

This place has some cool drinks, I definitely recommend it. They make their milk drinks with non-dairy creamer, but offer almond and soy milk substitutes!<//Text>

<date>1618669980869<//date><Review>Shocking how inept this office is. Was scheduled for an appointment to be put to sleep for my procedure. The day of my appointment after I'm already in the back sitting in the chair they told me they could not do my procedure because of a health issue I had disclosed MONTHS prior to going. Wasted my time and money. Blessing in disguise though, ended up taking my business elsewhere and paid a TENTH what these people charge. Would rate 0 if possible. Seems like all those 5 star ratings are fake accounts.< /Review></record>

<text>Just want to start off by saying that this dentist office is an hour away from me and after my my first visit I decided to stick with them. On my second visit (3/1/21) Dr. Kadakia performed a tooth extraction on me and the whole process was smooth and painless. She was so friendly and kept me relaxed the whole time, really glad she was the one who performed the extraction. I would also like to shout out the benefits coordinator Chandi, she was the first person I spoke to at South Corona Dental Group and really helped me  feel at home and at peace. Everyone here is really friendly and I appreciate their attentiveness and care for their patients!<//text>< rating>

I am a repeat customer who usually has had  an okay experience.  Problem is that last visit the office didn't explain my options to me as far as my insurance coverage goes.  Paid almost triple for a crown than I was supposed to according to my co-payment list.  Unfortunately I needed the work done and trusted them so I didn't double check my co-payment sheet and they took advantage of me.  Wasn't given any options just a total amount that I paid.  I called to question the charge after I reviewed my insurance claim and they told me that I signed the authorization for treatment so too bad.   It's unfortunate that they can't be honest and transparent with your treatment options and costs. Felt like I was dealing with a used car dealership.</Review>

<Review>I would never go here again!! They are liars, only after money. They claimed I needed $12,000 worth of work. I got 2 other dentists opinions and they said I definitely dont need that work!! And the dentist claimed she knew about TN (my condition) and she obviously didnt know anything,  just what she looked up on the net. This place is a total RIP OFF!!! their into cosmetic & way over charge for work you dont need done!!<//Review>< pics>

I think that this is the most efficiently run practice that I’ve ever been to. I was scheduled for my initial patient evaluation and a dental cleaning and was out the door within one hour of my appointment. Everything was explained completely detailed to me explained my insurance benefits to me highly recommend.< /Review>

< Review>
Be careful with this Dentist SMITA KADAKIA.  I had a very bad and terrible experience of my bridge and root canal that I don't want anyone to have that experience like me.  I had found out what she did my bridge which was really bad  and has a gap when I went to another dentist.  I was noticed her dental Assistant told her about the gap when she put on the bridge and she said it's okay, but it wasn't okay.  She is caring for making money to be survived there, but not caring patient.</Review>

The doctor was gental and very caring when it came to my fear of dental treatment. I’m so glad I found this place will definitely bring my family here.

< Review>
I went in for a scheduled cleaning, with full insurance. I had  been a client for several years. I didn't want x-rays. I was told that my insurance company would not cover unless I had x-rays. I would have to pay out of pocket. The insurance company refuted this when I called 2 days later.When I got the insurance to call the office they were told by the staff that no such thing was said to me, if they did xrays they wouldn't bill the insurance (yeah, right) and they basically denied everything. After waiting for over an hour I left without receiving my scheduled cleaning, because I refused to pay.
Very dishonest business practice, and liars as well. I now have a new dentist.< /Review>

And they answer no you will get the anesthesia regardless, I would of never found this out from them and i told them several times I didn’t have a lot of money. Well long story short I ended up paying $600 instead!! My advice to you is don’t come here unless you have an excellent insurance that way they can charge for all the extras they want.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb872108c39dd:0x4be4ea2837647b49</Gmap_id></record>

Do NOT accept their word for anything associated with the billing and your out of pocket.  call your insurance prior to paying the bill you will regret it if not  unfortunately they are not real ethical in that area<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I really love this dental office. All of the staff is very friendly. I'm not a fan of the dentist normally, they are very gentle and welcoming. They are open some Saturdays which is amazing for those who work.
I definitely recommend them!</review>

amazing customer service the minute we walked into the office. From the friendly staff to the amazing professional doctor, thoroughly explained all my dental work. I came in with a excruciating toothache, after days with no sleep and anxiety the doctor made my nerves calm down. She explained every single thing we could do, to stop the pain and prevent it from coming back. I can't thank them enough for accommodating us and making us feel great.<//Text>

I was experiencing tooth pain and Alicia was able to schedule me an appointment that day and Dr Kadakia took great care and my tooth pain was alleviated and my tooth was fixed.
Alicia and Dr Kadaki were efficient, caring, gentle, and just took great care of me. I would highly recommend south corona dental to my family and friends.</text>

As luck would have it, I had a tooth flare-up just before the 2019 Christmas Holiday, and the "Only" Dentist who was able to take me in for Xrays & treatment was my old friends at South Corona Dental. Dr Matthew Ellis and his staff got me right in, found the problem and got me the medications and treatment that I need and Dr Daly my Endodontist repaired a botched root canal from decades ago. I'm truly grateful to Dr Ellis and Dr Daly and ALL THE STAFF at South Corona Dental Group for their amazing, caring customer service..THANK YOU !< /review>

While a lot of the other reviews highly recommend this place, I cannot attest to being on the same page as them. Three years ago, I did everything I could to find a great dentist: checked reviews, looked up credentials, and even talked to former patients. Everything lead me to this establishment. However, I was stuck with a rookie dentist who messed up an expensive crown, as well as a filling. It could be my fault considering the time restraints I had put on both them and myself, but they insisted they could handle it and get everything done.
Getting the crown installed was simple, but I immediately noticed something was off. I even went back to explain my frustrations and asked what could be done, but they said "... some crowns just take time and the sensitvity should go away." It is a mistake on my behalf for believing that, considering two of the other crowns I had installed at the same time (within weeks of each other) felt absolutely great. I even expressed to the second doctor that I was handed off to, that the cement had chipped off one night while flossing and they insisted it was normal. While that may be the case in some instances, this was totally abnormal considering the entire lining of the tooth between my gum was exposed and extremely sensitive. Another thing they expressed as being normal. Three years down the road, the sensitivity has gotten so much worse that it is almost unbearable. I now have to get the crown replaced at a three year mark when they are guaranteed to be good for at least twenty. A $500 investment, after insurance I remind you, down the drain. The filling that I had done I'd also like to blame on the rookie dentist. A tooth that is mean to grind (one of the molars), she had left a gaping canyon within, as well as leaving sharp and jagged edges. During the filling, the dentist had tried to upsale me a few different times on something else, but to me a filling is a filling - and one would expect a dentist to fill and replace the tooth they drilled emtpy. I now have to have work redone on that tooth as well, considering how poor of a condition the dentist had left it in.
While two of the teeth are great and feel amazing, I would not recommend this place to a friend or family member unless you are local and have the time for multiple repeat visits to have issues resolved.< /Text>

<text>I have been going to South Corona Dental Group for 8 years. I remember my first visit with Dr Dhama like it was yesterday...I sat on my mom's lap while my little teeth were "counted." Due to the excellent care by everyone at South Corona Dental Group, I will never, and am not now, afraid of the dentist. You can count on Dr Dhama to make tooth extraction a pleasant experience.Dr Dhama is the nicest, patient-oriented dentists that I have ever used. Highly recommended!</text>< Time>

Scary situation when the NEW dentist approached me for a fallen off Crown and immediately suggested a Root Canal without even examining me!!.
I do NOT need a root canal!!, totally clear X-ray and zero pain.
I immediately told the new lady dentist to stay away from me and after many, many years I changed dental offices!!<//Text>

I would not recommend this dental office.  I had a bridge put in and it wasn't right from the beginning!  The attached it to what I found out later was a wisdom tooth, which probably explains why it looked nothing like a tooth at all!  It was oversized and caused many problems with my bite, jaw alignment causing headaches, not to mention coming loose on 3 occasions. I went along with their recommendations of re glueing, grinding it down and re glueing again.  Their last recommendation was a specialist that would cost over 4,000.00 and root cannel on the wisdom tooth, which in my opinion should have never been used as an anchor tooth in the first place if there was a problem with it.  This last time I went in because once again the bridge came loose.  I was told that  they needed to order a remake AT MY EXPENSE!  after I already paid  a great deal of money for this faulty bridge!   plus I would need to pay for the 4,000.00 recommendation of the wisdom tooth that is supposedly infected?  Honestly I don't believe it and nor do I ever remember them talking to me about such treatment.  This is the worst money hungry dental office I have ever dealt with and does not stand behind their work or their labs work they provide!    I asked for a refund and they refused!  Since the lab only guarantees the bridge for 1 year... now had I asked for it to be replaced and not let them talk me into all their failed fixes in the year I complained about it, I could have had it replaced.   Really??? why did they not suggest that??? It only took minutes this time going in for the dentist to finally admit it needed to be replaced... this way they will get more money...they said they were meeting me half way with cost?  if they check their records I paid the same for their first faulty bridge!  I have to give 1 star...if I had a choice it would be no stars!</Text>

<user_name>Fred Rodriguez<//user_name><Time>1622906355050< /Time><rating>1<//rating><text>I wasn't expecting a great time, but it was disgusting. The pizza tasted like a frozen pizza from the grocery store, the food was cold, and in my drink after I drank half of it there was plastic container stuck in the bottom of the Stein. When I went up to the manager and told them what happened he said sorry things happen can I refund you or do you want another drink. It should not have happened that is dirty and with all the pandemic that is been going on it should have been caught. At the end of the night when we were leaving one of the crew members told us how they had been robbed at least four times in the past few months right before closing and there were just waiting for us to leave so it was a very very intense moment and I will never ever go again to the location in Santa Ana.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Of the pizza I have had in the city so far, Shakey's Pizza Parlor is easily one of the top in my list. (If only they delivered or were closer to me!) The deep dish is excellent, with a perfect crust, fresh sauce and great topping combinations. The thin crust is really tasty as well. I love the caprese salad as a perfect appetizer for one or two. They have a great selection of wines and beer. The atmosphere is casual, but classy and kind of fun. Service has been alternately really friendly and great, and bordering on rude and neglectful. Other than this, Little Star is an awesome pizza place.< /Review>

What I got was dried out bland pizza, over fried chicken (some pieces were like jerky), and a mound of thinly-sliced, disappointing mojos.

With DoorDashe’s delivery charge, the whole order came to nearly $60.00. I was very disappointed with the quality of the food, because I’ve always loved Shakey’s chicken.

Maybe the event was too overwhelming, but that doesn’t take away my feeling of being overcharged to be underwhelmed.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dcd892393bb3bf:0x2ffa22fa64331a81</GmapID></record>

She was hyping it up, and saying its one of the best chicken sandwiches in Socal, so i decided to order the slider n tender combo medium and hot. It was really good, and the honey made the sandwich so much better. I would recommend just getting medium if you dont want to slightly sweat. The heat for the hot is good, and made me sweat a bit. Will definitely come back again< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I strongly believe she will make a great leader. The current " Boss " there is not so friendly or kind whats so ever. She deserves these Five Stars... not him. It's about what you'd expect. Pizza actually exceeded expectations, nice warm thin crispy crust and good overall taste and varied selection. Chicken was ok, spaghetti was a bit bland.  Decent price for buffet though. Less than $9 for lunch.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcd892393bb3bf:0x2ffa22fa64331a81</gmap_id></record>

Great quality food or at least Shakey standards. Love it. Good arcade, good service, clean, good morale in store. Helpful people. Salad bar was a mess. But great otherwise. We came for a family gathering and had a blast</text>

Very good pizza, and the "Bunch o' Lunch" is still being offered after all these years.  It's a great place for family entertainment and a meal.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's kind of expensive.  I can get a large pizza at "the competition" for half of what a medium costs at Shakey's.</Text>

It was a perfect place to have a fun dinner with friends. The staff was really nice. I was able to reserve for 20 so easily. There was no pressure about ordering ahead of time. It was really nice. Food was delivered to our table sooner than anticipated. It worked out really well.< /text>

<Text>Their all-you-can-eat buffet is great! They have alot of different pizzas, fried & roasted chicken, both are great! Plus other entrees and sides and a nice salad bar. This is not a high end buffet but I like it. Their people are friendly and eager to help. They have 4 or 5 large tv's in the main dining area (if there is an event you want to see, all you have to do is ask...they have the Dodger channel), an area for reserved parties and a game room that the kids seem to love. All-in-all it's a great place to have a meal and take the load off, enjoy some good food and watch a game.< /Text>< pics>

To start off we arrived closer to closing time, about 25 mins before... That being said the food was okay.... Not the best not the worst either. The pizza was lackluster but the chicken strips weren't too bad and neither were the potatoes. The place seemed clean. They seemed a little irritated that we showed up when we did... the guy taking our order wasn't very helpful, even though we said this was our first time there.<//text>

<Text>It's about what you'd expect. Pizza actually exceeded expectations, nice warm thin crispy crust and good overall taste and varied selection. Chicken was ok, spaghetti was a bit bland.  Decent price for buffet though.

Go on a week night after 8pm and your good. Take a close look at the soda dispensers, they are coated with grime in areas on the outer spout. But food was good besides pizza crust tasting a little cardboardy. Seat had greasy hand prints and crumbs on table. Ticket worker was rude to kids and tried to rush them to pick candy instead of a toy.<//review>

Lunch deals are good but have a big appetite to take advantage of the deal.  Standard buffet servings but limited.  Food was okay.  Several types of fresh pizza.< /review>

<Review>We had a bday party there, reserved 3 tables in the back room and it was great. The food was great, the service was awesome,  it was clean and not super crazy... would definitely recommend this location, the chicken and mojos we're on point... Thank you Shakey's Santa Ana for a great experience.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>Absolutely love this place. It's always crowded with families and local sports teams coming by for pizza, chicken, and Mojos.

Speaking of, their weekend lunch buffet is fantastic. You can fix yourself a great plate. Salad, rice, Mojos, pizza and chicken.

Their family arcade can keep the kids occupied and screens for sports! No frills, just good food for a cheap family night</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>The most ridiculous shakeys ive ever been to. Most of their machines dont work and instead of focusing on that they rather not sell me a salad bar for 10 something for my husband because i got a pcm medium pizza deal . Never coming back had to down grade his meal just to salad . Lost money never heard of a buisness doing that before</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If you want to hear crying and screaming from children whilst eating subpar pizza this is the spot for you! Pizza is subpar at best and the chicken is okay but nothing great. It's just a spot I visit probably once a year out of desperation after eating out at every other place.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Eh. If you have kids they won't know better. For the price the food is ok. But if you are watching your diet and can't consume mass quantities, go elsewhere.

I'm giving it 3 stars because it is what it is and is exactly what you expect it to be.</text></record></dataset><record>

In my opinion thid pizza really sucks lol,, i have never been a shakeys fan and im a pizza lover,,, pizza is salty, chicken is greasey, and mojos are dry with the taste of everything fried,, kids seem more intrested in the game room which does have a few of the newest games,, im sorry but this is my opinion and maybe your opinion is contrast to mine so im giving you the chance to be fair snd test this shakeys yourself then decide,,< /text>

I got the salad bar...but walked out before I had my second serving. I saw 2 flies near the salad bar. The salad containers did not look regularly maintained-not very clean. I must have caught a bug after eating there because I had stomach cramps all night. I called the restaurant the following day. I told them that they need to take care of that salad bar more often & maybe use better enclosure for their food. The manager was very rude, he probably thought I wanted a refund of freebies, he didn't care about the unsanitary issue, he said he was absolutely sure there was no flies in his food, and I saw that with my own two eyes. It was expensive anyway.....Eat there @ YOUR OWN RISK!<//Review>

<Text>The food is delicious but the salad bar doesn't have many options. It doesn't look like they maintain the salad bar very clean. I've seen alot of flies on the ingredients. I don't really eat  much salad there so is ok. On the other hand the pizza, chicken, and mojos are delicious. Little expensive but totally worth it.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd892393bb3bf:0x2ffa22fa64331a81< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice place
Affordable price
Food was good 👌
The cups were kinda dirty but other than that it was a nice new experience
Been coming here for a while and I gotta say that the area where the cokes and straws are at it's really dirty , everything is a mess ,the plates ,forks etc dirty , the area where the mash potatoes are at it's dirty it's mix with different foods like it falls from a customer plate and they just leave it there they don't clean it up<//text>

< Review>
I had to give this place a one star and only because I can't give 0. I mean, why do you have a person who has the worst attitude and speech impediment answering your phones? I had to question everything she said because she mumbles and I can tell she was getting frustrated when I kept asking her "excuse me? I'm sorry I can't understand what you're saying." Poor girl, poor service.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>(Translated by Google) You need more staff for when there are meetings or celebrations especially on holidays. I was invited to a party and the line was long and by the time it was my turn there was no pizza I had to go back to my place and wait for them to put back. Fortunately, my friend was well prepared and brought snacks and snacks for the meantime.

Necesita más personal para cuándo hay reuniónes o celebración en especial los días feriados. Yo fui invitada a una fiesta y la fila era larga y para cuándo llegó mi turno ya no había pizza tenía que volver a mí lugar y esperar que volvieran a poner. Afortunadamente mi amiga fue bien preparada y llevo botana y golosinas para mientras tanto.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) The food is fine, but the person in charge or owner does not know who it is, he just checks the ticket as if he were taking the free meal, it is annoying that apart from expensive you check what you eat or the time at the table.

La comida bien, pero el encargado o dueño no se quien sea, solo se anda checando ticket platos como si tomara uno la comida gratis, es molesto q aparte d caro t checken lo que comes o el tiempo en la mesa.< /Text>
