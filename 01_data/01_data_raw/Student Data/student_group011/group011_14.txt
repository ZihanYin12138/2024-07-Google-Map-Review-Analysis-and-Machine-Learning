I have been a customer of Century Business for about 1 year. Since meeting  Allie Sanchez my representative for all business solutions at Century Biz I have not seen a better communicator and problem solver in the merchant service business. What a great person she is from day 1 until this very day. I have since opened 3 more merchant service accounts for other businesses that I operate which also went flawlessly from start to finish. I have been accepting CC for 30 years and Century Biz Solutions has been the best by far. Wish I could give them 10 stars.<//text>

Bad customer service. Worked with a rep named Allie S. and she was unethical. I 've never seen a sale agent lying and unrealistic as her. She said something else and wrote something else on a contract expecting me not to pay attention and sign. That was disrespectful and insulting to me. Bad business practice. will never do business with this company.
There is a reason Square and Stripe are doing better business than you guys ...< /Review>

<username>Darryl Young< /username><Review>I am a small Online/Home base business and a few months ago was looking for a payment processing to replace my provider that was willing to put their customer first and as a priority. My company switched to Century Business Solutions 3 months ago. I signed up with Century Business Solutions to process my credit cards both online and mobile. The experience has been absolutely wonderful. Chuck, my direct rep, is exceptional. He is responsive, helpful, and follows through on issues that need immediate attention and getting a solution in a timely manner. Both the staff and support team has been amazing. I have been extremely happy and only good things to say about the entire experience. Thank you, Chuck</Review>< Time>

<text>Century is the best credit card processing company you can imagine. Our account manager Allie Sanchez saved us a ton of money and headaches when we made the switch over. She is always available to answer all our questions and got us great rates! During COVID century has proven why they are a top processor and why their customers love them.

Century Business has been an amazing company to deal with not only they offer competitive rates for small business owners but their customer service is the best you can expect.  As a small business owner I am happy to do business with business owners that focus on quality and integrity, and that is exactly how they operate.  One more HUGE benefits of doing business with Century is the transparency of your billing statements, they are extremely easy to read, with no hiding fees. Allie Sanchez has been my account representative for years and she has been incredibly responsive to all my needs and always available for anything I need.</text>

We signed up for credit card processing that is integrated wit our Quick Books software. The program is great and Chuck was great during and after the set up answering all of my questions. Anytime I have questions their tech support personnel answer the phone and are very helpful. No waiting in Queue or sent out of the country for help. I'd highly recommend.<//text>

We signed up with Century Business Solutions to process our credit cards.  Wow what a great experience.  Jill is terrific!  She held my hand every step of the way.  She was very responsive.  Well the whole team was very responsive.  Soup to nuts, took less that a week to be up and running directly through our Sage accounting software.  If you a credit card processing service, these are the folks that I would recommend.</review>

My company switched to Century Business Solutions months ago.  I have only good things to say about the entire experience.  Frank Gray, my direct rep, is responsive and helpful.  They integrated the program with our accounting system seamlessly.  The support team is also awesome. We requested a report everyday for all of our re-occurring payments and they created that report from scratch for us and it gets sent to us automatically everyday at 10:00. I would recommend these guys to any business.  Thank you Frank and team.

Century Business Solutions and my company have been working together for about four or five months now. The experience has been absolutely wonderful. Chuck, our Business Relationship Manager, is exceptional. Within an hour of emailing him, I receive a phone call explaining how he is finding an answer for me, getting a solution, or what he is able to do for me. He will even call back to ensure that everything has been resolved. I can't say enough amazing things about Century Business Solutions and their exceptional customer service. Thank you, Chuck for being so great!<//Review>

<Text>After being in business since 2013 we've used tooo many credit card companies.  Solutions in their name.  I had trouble with my printer after the soft ware was installed so called Chuck and he set me up with the tech support team. It had nothing to do with the software  but more with printer.  seriously tho, received my first bill and very satisfied with how simple the statement look.

Having to get a new credit card processing company can be really frustrating. However when I talked to Madison F she made everything easy to understand. She has been by far the best representative I have ever spoke with. She made the switch to CBS so smooth. Always friendly and even 6 months into the program she calls to see how things are going. Best move our company ever made. Madison F is the best representative a person could ask for. She will go above and behind for you!!<//Text>

I do not usually write reviews but felt compelled, this is very overdue.  I have been a customer of Century Business for years.  From day one the company has delivered what was promised, SAVINGS, SAVINGS and more SAVINGS.  I truly appreciate Bryce he has been there for us from the beginning, a top notch guy who truly cares about his customers.  I also wanted to give a shout out to Sam in technical support.  I am on the East Coast and called this morning with an emergency situation.  Sam called me back by 6:00 am because he realized the severity of the situation and did not hesitate to jump in and fix the problem.  Great job Sam you really helped us out of a bind.  I cannot express how grateful we are to have a partner like Century.  I just want to be on record as saying a company is only as good as the people who work there, hats off to you guys.  Again many thanks!!!!!!!!!!!<//text>

I want to say it was an absolute pleasure working with Maria Rous. Her insights and expertise in the limo companies are priceless. What Century Business Solutions can bring to the table is well worth taking a look at if you want to put money back in your bottom line. It doesn’t matter Big or Small they will have a solution for you. So reach out to this stunning beauty and tell them Steve sent you and Maria will do the rest.< /review>

<review>As a fairly new customer of Century Business Solutions, I wasn't aware how amazing their chargeback team was really going to be. In my opinion, my previous provider dropped the ball without any explanation. I initially called Allie Sanchez, my account rep, who got me in contact with Michelle in their charge back team. After explaining the situation, Michelle provided the necessary information for me to contest the chargeback. Thank you to her and the whole team at CBS for the amazing customer service. Stay healthy!!!<//review>< username>

My father and I were very happy to be able to work with Chuck Young.  He was very knowledgeable about our Quickbooks and saved us money on our credit card processing.  He is not only knowledgeable but also very humble.
Thank you!<//Review>

<text>Madison was awesome to work with.  I recently referred one of my customers to CBS for their credit card payment solution and Madison helped me.  She's responsive and understands my customer's requirements.  My customer was very pleased with the experience and they end up signing with CBS.

Been using Century Business Systems for credit card processing for a couple of years now. We are happy with the service. It saved us a lot of money over using Intuit to process credit cards. We use the QuickBooks Pro plug-in they provide so we can charge credit cards from right with-in QuickBooks. Very convenient. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that I can't process credit cards through my smart phone. They sent me a scanner, but then I discovered they have a very small list of cell phones that it will work on. So I had to send it back. But it's not a big deal.<//text>

We have never had to wait on hold for very long and the customer service person is always friendly and very helpful.  We've also been contacted by many similar companies who "can get us a lower rate for credit card processing".  I've given the information and allowed them to give us a quote but, they come back with the same response every time…." it looks like you're getting a good deal that we can't beat". We are very pleased and would definitely recommend Century Business Solutions.<//Text>< pictures>

I don't really have any complaints which is saying something. I've been through the song and dance with a few different merchants over the years and this is the first company that actually did what they said they would and it works with SAP so the accounting team loves it.

<review>I have used many Merchant processing vendors and Century Business is the best I have ever experienced. I switched over for my Sage accounting a few years ago and have been very happy with the service. I don't even consider switching to a different company because their pricing, services and tech support is so much better than others we've used.  They always answer their phone, they have quickly responded to problems even on weekends for me. Their team is great! flexible, easy to work with and have spent many hours helping me fix problems and set up online portals.  I am very grateful for how they've helped my business.  Thank you Century Business Solutions!<//review>< pictures>

We've been using CBS for about 2 years.  They have done a great job for us!  We use Sage Software and initially, we were having problems each time we would install a Sage updates.

There are a lot of shady credit card processing companies out there and I always dread trying to weed out the good ones.  I have been more than thrilled how Bryce Benekos and his team has treated us through the whole process of converting over 9 different locations several months ago.  He has always been extremely responsive to questions and I feel like I finally have a company that quoted a rate that I can actually verify and doesn't change.  I highly recommend you consider them.  Ask for Bryce!<//Review>

< Review>
I've used Century Business Solutions for over 5 years to process credit cards.  Within the last year, I was contacted by another merchant processor and decided to give them a try as their rates were cheaper.  Cheaper isn't always better! Within a month of switching to the new processor, I was contacting Century Business Solutions to reopen our accounts.

Century Business Solutions has the easiest user web processor with the Ebiz site and customer service is always helpful and quickly resolves any requests I may have.

I won't be tempted by other processor solicitation calls promising cheaper rates ever again!</Review>

My philosophy on writing business reviews is to only write them when the service delivery exceeds normal expectations.  In this case that is exactly what I experienced.  As the CEO of my company, merchant account decisions usually don’t fall within my area of responsibility.  In this case I’m glad that it did.  Maria Roussa did an excellent job of not only giving me the rationale for why Century Business would save me money, but she also shepherded my team through the on boarding process.  This included not only my accounting people but IT as well.  The most important thing to me is that once I committed to moving to Century, she made sure that the process was as painless as possible.  We should all have staff that are as diligent, and customer oriented as Ms. Roussa.  I am delighted to recommend Century Business and look forward to a longstanding relationship.</Review>

We have been using Century Business since 2014 and have had overall great service. Their E-Biz popup app works great with our Quickbooks Enterprise software. No double data entry just receive payment in Quickbooks and run the credit card then all the transaction info gets posted into Quickbooks.  Any small problems we have had over the years have always been taken care in a timely manner and our customers service reps have been very nice and helpful with any questions we had.

ON TOP OF THAT, I was struggling with an Excel spreadsheet and in my conversation with him I discovered he was an Excel EXPERT, so I asked him to help me.  Well, he did and he went above & beyond in service to his new customer!  So, a big THANK YOU to Adrian!  Everglades Diesel Injection Service, Fort Lauderdale, FL< /Review>

I own Helen's Heart LLC. I have been with them for many years, they deliver what they quote on and don't sneak up the prices slowly over time. I know, I audit my own account every year (Trust but Verify). I will not say I have never had a problem but when I do their support is knowledgeable and responsive. They even fixed a bug in their Ebiz plugin for Intuit's QuickBooks brought on by an Intuit's own update within four hours of my reporting the issue to their standard tech support via their in-house developers. No other merchant processor has come close to that performance in either keeping their promises or technical support in my experience and I have been through more than a few.< /text>

Source of annoying and numerous unsolicited spam emails pumped out nearly automatically, without an unsubscribe option. Very unprofessional way to try to dredge up business. And FYI Brian Chester, who put a review down below about how great they are, is actually the sales guy sending out this stuff. So you can ignore his five stars.</Review>

We have been using Century Business Solutions as out credit card gateway for about a year now and can't say anything bad about them. The team is very responsive to support questions, assisted us with the setup of our ERP software at no additional charge, and was also able to provide us with the cheapest rates from all providers that we have contacted when we were shopping for a new provider.

One thing that we found as a great benefit as well is that Century Business Solutions has a wide variety of integrations to different ERP systems as well as eCommerce solutions. So, if we ever decide to switch any of our systems, we will be able to take our credit card processing with us.<//Text>

We've been with Century Business Solutions for over a year now after switching from Sage Solutions. CBS is everything we expect from a service company standpoint; efficient, professional, knowledgeable and always willing to work with our webmaster for solutions to processing issues. During our conversion to a Magento2 platform, CBS was always there to help with some one off engineering designs. They always answer emails and telephone calls in a timely manner. Pricing is excellent too!

Our primary poc is Bryce Benkos and his attention to detail, with ability to get things done for us earns a 5 star in our book every time.

Not sure why the negative reviews as the hundreds of interactions via email and telephone we have had with various CBS employees has been nothing but excellent.</text>

Tried to get set up with them. Deceptive sales pitch initially which they owned up to after calling them out (savings were several hundred dollars less than suggested). Once I signed up, they began asking for me to open my books to them for the last year which seems scammy for a credit card processing program. The sales supervisor would not return my phone call and after I refused to provide the DNA of my first AND second child (being fecicious), I was told we were not a good fit. The sales pitch felt like a time share presentation where instead of getting free Disney tickets, I got to waste an hour of my life. I didn't realize the reviews for this organization were so terrible until I went to post this. I still don't understand how businesses with 3 stars or less stay in business ... Oh yeah, it seems I dodged a bullet with this company.<//Text>

<Date>1462811506814<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>I had worked with Century for several years, and always was very pleased with their merchant servicing. I understand they recently changed management and it has been a complete disaster since. Communication has gone down the drain, they never respond to email or voicemails anymore. I had to cancel one of my merchant accounts with them and they continued to bill me for 2 months saying there is nothing they can do as this is apparently their process. I will now be canceling my 2 other merchant accounts with them now and taking my business elsewhere.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>Beware of this company! They will try selling you their service, start charging and never do the service you signed up for. No resolution yet after having asked for it numerous times, they continue to charge us fees, which our bank has blocked. Next step-litigation. They deserve 0 stars! Waste of time and effort.< /review><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

I requested a detailed statement of our credit card processing 13 days ago.  To date, they have yet to provide me with one or an explanation for the delay.  It doesn't seem unreasonable to expect a response in half that time.  I don't know if it's lack of resources or if they normally drag their feet when they see a customer likely leaving, but the level of treatment they've given me in the last 13 days is abysmal.< /text>

If I could rate this -10 I would. Continuous unwanted emails in both my inbox and spam folder. I have ask to be taken off their list and they sent me an invoice instead. When I tried to open it to see what it said, my security software block it as malicious software. Beware of this company, especially Brian Chester! Not sure where they even got my info to start harassing me with their company.<//review>

I called and asked if a front bumper was available for me to test for before purchase, and they told most it would be drop shipped. I placed my order on Friday morning and a shipping label was not made until 8pm on Monday. Then my part was due to arrive at my house on Tuesday the same week, only for it to be delayed until Thursday. I checked the location for part AND IT WAS IN STOCK AT THEIR WAREHOUSE. They never bothered to check their stock after I asked if it was there. Lo and behold I received my part one week later, which could have been purchased and picked up same day. Not to mention the part doesn’t fit my vehicle. I’m not even gonna ask for a refund, their negligence and incompetence has proven how garbage this company handles things. Wanna buy car parts? Don’t go here. You’ll have better luck with literally any other brand/store/site.< /review>

I ordered a pair of side mirrors to my Honda civic! Got a wrong item! I call the customer service and ask to send me a part that missing and one of the representatives, her name Danelle! told me that I have to first send them back a wrong parts I got from them and only after I will get the one I pay for! I told her that I can't go anywhere now because I'm from New York and everything close due to COVID 19! So will definitely send the wrong parts back as soon as I can! I tried explain to her that it's not my fault that I got a wrong items! So why should I have to put my life in to risk and go to the crowded main post office in the time of COVID19? Company made mistake and they should fix that! On top of everything I just described, Danelle just hung up the phone! I tried to call again and as usually all representatives were busy!!!!

3 right mirrors!!! Should just one left and one right!!
Thank you!!!< /text>

<Review>Very disappointing when you get rear tail lights from this company for my Lexus and they won't cover return shipping label because the it arrived damaged while they were getting shipped here.
Be careful what you buying from these people they sell damaged parts and leave their customers hanging with damaged parts. Scamming company.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>AMAZING Customer Service!!!

I ordered a side-view mirror for my F150.  Received the next day!!!  However, I ordered the wrong one.

K2 (Natalie) arranged for a pre-paid return shipping label, this despite the listing clearly stating buyer pays return shipping costs.< /Text><user_name>John Tanabe< /user_name>< time>

<Review>Fantastic customer service - I purchased an item via eBay, after installation I had a fitment issue - I called K2 to see about a replacement part and they worked with me to get the issue corrected.  They were quick to respond and super helpful!

If you are looking for a company locally to do business - I give them AAAA+++++++++

Keep up the good work - hope we can do business together in the future.</Review>< rating>

Customer service was quick to respond to our request to exchange the part we ordered. Jackie and Jed responded to our questions and quickly worked to resolve the issue without charging us a shipping charge for the exchange. They were kind, professional and efficient. Thank you.<//Review>

Still waiting for a return call since 6/25 when I spoke to Cassandra. Left 5 more messages since then, this time, Karen assured me a supervisor would return my call.< /Text>

I had bought coilovers from another company and springs to small & short. Your coil springs are much bigger that is what I needed. Thanks< /review>

<Review>Purchased an exhaust pipe from them and lost the silencer just weeks after install. Went to their website for the Live Chat service to seek for help. Janet, who was very patient with me helped me out and set up a replacement for me. I have to say that my experience with K2 Motor has been super pleasant! The product was great and Janet's customer service just pushed it to the next level.
Thank you K2 Motor!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Took 3 weeks to send me headlights. Had to call repeatedly to figure out where my package was. Promised me 3 day shipping to make up for the 3WKS I waited, and the tracking number they sent said it won’t arrive for FIVE days. Don’t waste your hard earned money here. They don’t care about wasting a customers time and they don’t deserve your patronage.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Bought headlights, taillights, and 3rd brake light off eBay.  All installed easily;however, had issues with 3rd brake light not working..contacted customer service, and they are replacing it, with free shipping and no cost.  I would recommend this company for any auto parts.  Thank you k2motors.<//text>

I bought an item from K2 through Walmart.com. I ended up having to return the item, so I contacted K2 via the online chat and I was helped by Casandra. She was so great and helped me with my return. Great customer service!</Text>

<text>The best place ever to get your taxes done! I love the service I get here! Sid is so friendly and nice; he explains everything to you from A to Z and treats you like his own family member. I’ve been coming to Sid for the past 4 years and never have had any issues with my taxes. He is friendly, trustworthy and the most easy going person ever.<//text></record>

He was great! Had a good sense of humor & resolved my issue of filing my taxes as a first-timer. Normally, I go online but thought it would be better to go to an actual expert. If you don’t know what you’re doing, I highly recommend you go to him!</Text>

Hands down the best place to file your taxes. Our old tax lady was not in service anymore due to pandemic shutdown so this year we decided to come here and file. Let me tell you from the second i called to set up an appointment till filling our taxes i had such a amazing experience. i use to dread filling my taxes because i have multiple businesses and multiple rental properties and then also some investment income so the paperwork and all the small details get overwhelming for me. My tax prepare the tall guy took it all off my hands and did an amazing job. He explained me all concerns and questions and he did much better then i could have expected. Not cheap but worth every dime and penny because you get what you pay for.

Thank you liberty tax service i highly recommend this place and i know for sure i will keep coming back for years and even send family friends this way.

Amazing place to get your tax’s done! Sid’s such a knowledgeable person, taught me so much about my taxes and helped me so much understand the purpose of filing my taxes and the benefits of doing my taxes with him and at liberty tax. So much peace of mind not having to worry about anything I’ve heard story’s of people doing there taxes and getting there stuff messed but doing my taxes with liberty and with Sid I feel so comfortable with everything we did!

Highly recommend everyone to do there taxes at liberty tax on Stockton blvd and 65th street with Sid amazing place loved the service!</text>

I have been utilizing Tax liberty services on Stockton blvd in Sacramento for about 7 or 8 yrs and it has ALWAYS been a knowledgeable and  friendly experience. I absolutely refuse to utilize any other tax preparation service! Sid has great energy, he responds in a timely manner to all of my email inquiries and returns all of my phone calls promptly. He is an exquisite professional who really takes pride in helping his clients with their tax needs. Go check him out for yourself, you won’t be disappointed!<//Text>

<Review>I have been using Liberty Tax for over two years now. I always can count on Sid to handle my tax returns and take care of everything for me. I just simply email my information and he handles it without any hassle. He is willing to help on his off days and follows up with everything. I have recommended Sid to my friends and will continue to use him for years to come. Thank you!!!</Review>< Name>

I made an appointment online about a week in advance and received an automated confirmation via text- so far so good. The day of the scheduled date, an hour before the scheduled time, they tell us they are fully booked and unable to take us until 6 hours later- fine I'm not doing anything anyways.

That time rolls around, they text us to tell us they can't take us because their internet is down, lets reschedule for next week...fine.

One week later, I show up for the scheduled appointment at the scheduled time, the doors are locked and they don't respond to my text.<//Text>

< Review>
I’m a small business owner. Parambir was very knowledgeable and helpful while preparing my taxes. Even if I get audited for my taxes, Parambir took my headaches away by handling or walking me thru the audit.— I can run my business but, I know nothing about taxes. I trust Parambir Singh as my tax guy. Highly recommend him to all my friends and family<//Review>

Sid really took time to help me with my taxes. He was patient and kind. He helped me get the most out of my 1099 by adding up my expenses would recommend 5 out of 5 stars to come here< /text>

Cant say enough about this place. Been coming here since 2011 and every year they treat me like family. Sid's is really great at what he does. Every year i walk out with $50 cash just for filling but  this year Sid  even got me $3000 advance on my refund to help me take care of some bills< /Text>

Parambir was so nice and helpful!
I usually go to Jackson Hewitt to get my taxes done, but this last year I didn’t have a great experience so I decided to look for a new company to handle my taxes.
Parambir took the time to explain everything to me and asked questions to make sure he was getting me the most money back on my taxes.
If this is your first time filing or like me your looking for a new company and want a positive experience I definitely recommend going to liberty!

This review is not paid for or sponsored by liberty lol I genuinely had an amazing experience and plan on staying with them in the years to come.</text>

I went to Hr block and had an horrendous experience. I am retried but last year i had a part time job and finally had to file taxes after 17 years went to HR thinking they got me and have my back as they advertise. Worst experience ever the tax preparer was rude and unwilling to answer any questions. Rejected me for not having IP PIN which i didnt even know what it was. Called Liberty and talked to SID and damm rest was history. Filed my taxes refund came in timely manner and i will be back next year.</review>

Lemme start off by saying if you haven’t filed your taxes you would want to visit my guy SID . He’s very professional , outstanding customer service , when I tell you I was stressed about my tax year he reassured me everything would be perfect & while filing my taxes everything went smooth . Thanks to him I’m stress free lol . I was asked if I wanted an advanced loan I said yes I was appproved in less than 1 hour and my money took 24 hours to deposit to my card . Thank you SID for your amazing help I most definitely will be back for the next tax year . Everyone reading this book your appointments NOOOOOWWWW !!! I PROMISE YOU WILL LEAVE WITH A BIG SMILE ON YOUR FACE UNTIL NEXT YEAR SID SEE YOU SOON !!!</Review>

Highly recommend this location of liberty tax. All of the employees are really helpful and friendly. I personally work with the amazing tall gentleman named Parambir Singh. He has been taxes for me and my family for years now and we don’t trust anyone else but him. He is very professional and timely mannered and will also send you reminders for the due dates or update you what documents are missing and even text you to drive safe before your appointment with him. Very respectful and hard working and does an amazing job filing our taxes as well. I would highly recommend him, he’s also bilingual, which really helps with my parents getting their taxes done since they don’t speak English that well. Always go back to him every year! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼< /review>

A beautiful fishing pier at a nice quiet beach. Dogs are allowed in the beach, whe on a leash, but dogs cannot go out on the pier.  That was the only bummer. Awesome views from the end of the pier and good fishing.< /Text>

Something for everyone. But even with a little fog it was a safe place to watch sleeping sea lions. The protected area north had a few calves that made it to the pier. Amongst heighters beach goers and kite flyers the sleeping sea lions rested between feedings.<//text>

<review>This was a nice place to stop. The park was pretty quiet and there were tons of cool birds flying around and some sea otters playing in the bay. The wind wasn't too bad and parking was easy.<//review>< userid>

The beach was fined and most people were very nice. But not enough people kept their pets on a leash. One lady even didn't bother coming to get her dog when it picked a fight with another dog, with a puppy even. Just rude.<//review>

Very quaint. Across from the Hearst Ranch Winery and Pier. Hearst Castle is on the other side of PCH 1.  Beautiful !<//review>

<Review>Come early to grab parking and a spot on the beach. There are a lot of sand flies by the water, however, the views cannot be beat< /Review>< GmapID>

I stopped here with my wife after a brief stop at Hearst Castle and found a gem.  There were Elephant Seals basking/asleep on the beach and we saw a mother Otter and her baby at the end of the pier. Beautiful warm sunshine made it very enjoyable.< /review>

<Text>Great place for family outings. The beach is great. You can rent kayaks. You can picnic or barbecue. There is tables and some grills. The restrooms are ok most of the time. The best weather is in the fall. The summer is good but lots of fog in the morning. Closes at sunset.</Text>< Time>

I'll add a time lapse on the pier. One of better places to come and enjoy in San Simeon. The place has a nearby Museum for for the tourists with detailed info about the sea life at this place. The location also has tables at least 10 to come in and enjoy the any picnics or food that you have brought. If you would like to go on a hike there is a hike on the right side of the pier which takes you along for you to enjoy the view from the coastline. You can explore the Wild Life by the coast and take some photos.</review>

<Text>What words could be said that could even do  San Simeon any justice? Words could never describe how very much this utterly beautiful place means to my family. *If you ever wonder if there really is a God and if He really does love YOU... go stand on San Simeon Pier..... especially nearing sunset. Look around. Just BE. Breathe it in. Let those doubts fade with His sunset into peaceful assurance right there. All nature proclaims the Glory of God ~ especially in this place. 🕊< /Text>< Pictures>

It's interesting to see what big money could buy back in the early 20th century California. Beautiful views all the way to the Castle and up and down the coast, people fishing off the pier and catching something, kinda relaxing for the mind.<//text>

(Translated by Google) There are not many tourists near the dusk, and seagulls and water ducks gather together. It is an attraction suitable for short stays.

接近黃昏遊客不多，海鷗、水鴨群聚，是適合短暫停留拍照的景點。< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is a beautiful place to see in the infinity that the sea meets the blue sky, the fresh breeze that leaves a salty taste on your lips, and at the top of the hill the castle of the heart is majestic and in the distance you can see the elephant seals😍 recommended !!

Es un bello lugar ver en el infinito que se une el mar con el cielo azul, la brisa fresca que deja un sabor saladito en tus labios, y en lo alto del cerro se ve majestuoso el castillo del corazón y a lo lejos se ven retozar los elefantes marinos😍  recomendado!!</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very relaxed down here, if you compare it to the hustle and bustle of the mountain ...

Sehr entspannt hier unten, wenn man es mal mit dem Trubel aufm Berg vergleicht...</Text>

If you come early in the morning it is also not too hot highly recommended for families and breaks in between. Right off the pier is a very nice beach where you can go swimming if you feel like walking but also can go for a walk. Behind the pier are a few houses with some farms and horses.

(Original)
Das ist ein sehr langer Bier bis jetzt der Größe den ich gesehen habe. Wenn man früh morgens kommt ist es auch nicht zu heiß sehr empfehlenswert für Familien und Pausen zwischendurch. Rechts vom Pier ist ein sehr schöner Strand in dem man wenn man Lust hat schwimmen gehen kann aber auch spazieren gehen kann. Hinter dem Pier befinden sich einige Häuser mit einigen Farmen und Pferden.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Great place to relax! There are even benches available and with luck you can see whales passing by. It is most beautiful in the morning when the pier is opened (08:00 clock - sunset).

Toller Ort zum Entspannen! Es sind sogar Sitzbänke vorhanden und mit etwas Glück kann man Wale vorbeiziehen sehen. Am schönsten ist es gleich morgens wenn der Pier geöffnet wird (08:00 Uhr - Sonnenuntergang).</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very nice place, absolutely relaxed and with a great view. A lot of nature to watch. In November we saw numerous whales here. Of course, only from a distance, but very impressive. An angler told me that the whales sometimes came close to the pier. Unfortunately not during our visit, but sitting relaxed on the bench and watching whales from afar and sea lions was still awesome.

(Original)
Sehr schöner Ort, absolut entspannt und mit toller Aussicht. Viel Natur zu beobachten. Im November haben wir hier zahlreiche Wale beobachten können.  Natürlich nur aus der Ferne, allerdings sehr beeindruckend. Ein Angler sagte mir, dass die Wale zeitweise auch bis dicht an die Pier kommen. Bei unserem Besuch leider nicht, aber entspannt auf der Bank sitzen und Wale aus der Ferne und Seelöwen beobachten, war trotzdem genial.< /review></record>

<Text>Elena McBound is awesome!  Her calmness is very welcomed during this time of year 👍.  Elena is polite, courteous, friendly and has  a great sense of humor.  My wife and I have only been going to her for 2 years and we will continue to use her for our taxes every year.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Humberto was very helpful in finding a great price to replace 2 tires. He was very courteous and knowledgeable as was the rest of the staff. They made me and my 8 year old very comfortable while we waited about 45 minutes to have the service completed. I recommend Discount tires of Pasadena to anyone in need of excellent tire service.< /Text>

He quoted me 90 minutes but it was realistically 2.5 hours. The service area and waiting rooms were clean and offered fresh coffee.  Other then the wait time, I would definitely recommend considering this location for your tire needs.<//review>< pics>

I had a flat tire yesterday, and got my new tire serviced by Edgardo who was super helpful, friendly, and efficient. I was in and out of there within 30 minutes or less with a new tire. Even as I was leaving, my car's ignition struggled a little bit and Edgardo came out to inspect it to make sure I was okay to go home despite the store's closing time. I really appreciate it since I'm not very knowledgeable about cars.

Great place! I highly recommend, and if I ever need service I'll be sure to come here again.<//text>

I arrived late morning with a donut on my rear and hook in my tire in the trunk. Spoke with Bob. He got me in and out right away so I can return to work. Forgot the techs name that changed my tire. Very professional put the donut back the way it was supposed to be. I was not expecting that. Great job!< /Review>

<review>Been there twice this year, and in a good way. First I needed tires for my 2009 Nissan cube. Called in the morning and setup an appointment that day, got a great deal on tires, alignment, and warranty. Plus they take care of flats and free tire rotation. Then most recently with a 2013 Toyota Prius V. Rear tire had a nail in it, called in the morning asked if they could get me in, told me to come by and they'll look at it. Got there a couple hours later because of prior commitments, able to fix it quickly and at a reasonable price that day, less than 2 hours. Will recommend this place to friends.< /review>< pics>

Another great visit at Discount Tire Centers! This time I was not only dealing with a flat tire but a damaged rim. It is the staff and their honesty that keeps me not only a customer but one who refers. Edgardo was exceptional and extremely helpful with not only solving my problem quickly but securing me the best deal possible.< /Review>

< Review>
The car was feeling a bit off and I realized it was overdue for tire balance and rotation, probably needed alignment. I found Discount Tires on Google Maps, read some of the other reviews, and figured I’d try it out. I was there for about an hour which seems reasonable to me. I felt heard and respected and now the car feels great. I’ll be back in another 5000 miles.< /Review>

I went to 3 different places to get estimates as to where I would sevice my car. I went by price, but was truly impressed with your staff, especially Angel. They were professional and explained everything coherently and without any subterfuge.  I drive a very old car and always appreciate when car repair places don't try to pump up the bill. Four tires and some serving completed, thanks.<//Review>

<review>When I make my appointment, I was forced to decide no late than 3pm to do my tire rotation, but when I went to do it they say is ok until 5pm. The attention was fabulous, but because they didn't  let me go later than 3pm I decide for just 4 start.

Overall the service was just okay. Extremely long wait times. Even with an appointment it took over 2 hours for something that should have taken about 30-45 minutes, maybe an hour tops. Also, they seem a bit overpriced. They have good customer service through and good at diagnostics from what I can tell.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Went there to buy a tire which had gone bad. The Vice President himself came out and took my information on the tire. We went back into the store to match the tires I had. They did not have the exact match in their store in Pasadena. So they called their other stores and found a match. The Vice President himself Mr Joe Seitz drove his own personal car to the other location and picked the tire up and brought it to the Pasadena location. This took about 20 to 30 minutes. This to me shows excellent customer service, going way above and beyond. The price of the tire and service to my vehicle was lower than I expected. Today with their outstanding performance they have made me a customer for life.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Excellent service .  I brought my Audi for wheel alignment service that a different tire shop botched.  Discount Tire Center fixed  it.  Their technician, Juan, is fantastic - very knowledgeable,  professional and courteous.  He explained in details what was wrong and how he fixed it.  I’m super happy with the work Juan did on my car.  I hope his company will give him a good wage increase as he is worth the money .  Thank you, Juan.  The front desk people were very nice as well.  The only suggestion for the office is to improve the appointment scheduling to avoid waiting too long (but this is common with auto shop business)< /review>< pics>

I showed up early for my appointment and it was just chaos.  At least 3 employees didn’t have masks on, there were 3-4 customers just wandering around the parking lot.  The gentleman manager at the front was helping a customer but was loud and rude and in and out of the lobby (consulting with the employees with no masks) and after 15 minutes told me 2 things...1) That my car would be at least 3-4 hours (they hadn’t looked at it yet) and 2) that “everyone had an appointment”.  Ok...so when the third thing he said to me (15 minutes and they still didn’t know who I was or why I was there) was to tell me to move my car.  So I got in to move it and I just left, this place was the pits.  Drove up the road and stopped in another place (no appointment) but my car is being worked on now and I’ll be done in 30 minutes.  Took me less time here to get it diagnosed fixed than it did to be even acknowledged at the other place!  I can’t speak to the quality of their work but the customer service was terrible, which is enough for me.< /review>

I had a very pleasant experience at Discount Tire Centers. Somehow picked-up a nail in one tire. It was close to quitting time on a Friday. I expected they would tell me to come back tomorrow, but Richard greeted me with a friendly smile & said they would take care of removing the tire & patching it. The service was performed quickly and Richard refused to let me pay. He was such a nice person with a great sense of humor. My step-father had just passed away. I was really down in the dumps, but Richard made me laugh and smile. He made me feel better than I had in days!!!  The moral of the story. There are still a lot of kind people out there despite all of the tragedies we are bombarded with every day via news media.
Thank you again Richard 😉. May God Bless You and Yours 🙏
Sincerely,
Leslie< /Text>

<text>they installed the incorrect tires.  I told person at counter and he said a manager would contact me.  Manager did not call.  I called and Leo (manager) said he knew nothing about installing wrong tires.  Leo questioned me driving around on wrong tires and wanted me to pay any cost difference.  After going back a second time to have correct tires installed, Leo said there is no extra cost.  I asked Leo if he found out what happened, he said they put the wrong tires on.

And total price for new tires plus installation and future tire rotation was actually less than quoted price from one of the lowest direct-online tire sellers (that doesn't have same brick and mortar overhead, and ships to other auto service centers for installation).

I'll be happy to return to Discount Tire in the future.  Thanks!</Review>< pictures>

2012 VW Golf TDI currently 151,000 purchased used at 25,500

Obviously a great deal over time as the service is free after the initial investments

<Review>Horrible customer service from Ark Gutierrez. I showed up for balance and rotation. After 45 minutes since they remove the 4 tires,  Ark called me and said that I need a new set of 4 tires. I said that I won't be changing them today but I need pricing on 5 different models. I gave him the name of the first brand and model and he said $83 each.  I told him that i need to know the final price with all the fees and installation cost of the 5 different brands and he said that he doesn't have time for that.  He added that the tires are going to be around $85 each even though I never mentioned the name of the other brands.   At this location I bought 3 set of tires  and 1 set for my wife's car(16 tires total)  in the las 3 years. He said that my car is ready and I asked him if they did the rotation and balance and he said no since I need  new tires. My tires still have to 2mm left from the safety zone. This review it's only for Ark Gutierrez. In the last three years that I've been coming here everybody was very nice< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Though they do take a little while to do a service with or without an appointment they are busy and are very helpful otherwise. They take good care of what your car needs for a very good price. With Warrenties! Already referred my mom and will be referring anyone else here.<//text>

<Text>I came in to discount tire centers to replace a tire that was beyond  repair.  I called ahead of time, they located a tire and they would have it in the afternoon.  I  came in and they  wrote up a service agreement to replace the tire and did an alignment check ( I have a warranty on the tires and alignment  from discount tire centers). Everybody was friendly and professional.  Got my car service with no problems.  Great experience. I will continue to use discount tire centers for my tires and auto maintenance needs.  And continue to recommend them for great value and good service. Sincerely, Gustavo Correa< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Richard and the staff displayed excellent customer service today when I took my vehicle in to get a brake check. After checking out what exactly was wrong he informed me what the problem was and how they could fix it. Not once did I get the feeling of being taken advantage of or being up-sold. After coming to a great price he and the staff took great care of my car and they got the service done in a timely manner.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I have been going to Discount Tire Centers in Pasadena since the early 1980's. I have had multiple sets of tires, brakes and shocks installed on several different vehicles over that course of time and have always been satisfied with their workmanship and performance. Their location at Hill and Walnut has been the most convenient ever. Try them out.</Text>

When I made the appointment I said I would be pressed for time and asked how long it would take.  I was told no more than 90 minutes.  When I arrived, the process of checking in and getting quotes took 45 minutes.  He then said it would take another 90 to do the car.  I wasn’t thrilled but said okay, and walked around the neighborhood and made phone calls.  After more than 90 minutes had passed, I walked back and asked if my car was ready.  He told me no, it was waiting for alignment which would take another 30 minutes.  At that point, I said I would take the car now and get alignment another time.  After I drove off I realized the tires were overinflated and had to stop at a service station.  I will never go back there!</Text>

Everything went well. They took less time than proposed and they pointed out a few things about my newly used car that I would not have noticed. This stopped a future problem that could have came up in a few months and cost me money. They were also friendly and seemed to know what they were doing.<//review>

<user_name>Hector Viramontes< /user_name><Review>I just went in and had some work done on my car and the staff could not have been nicer and more informative. I dread going into auto shops such as Pep Boys for instance, because I’m always made to feel dumb, judged and taken advantage of for not knowing that much about cars (usually by a male associate.) But the workers at the Discount Tires in Pasadena were quite the opposite!

Wanda at the front desk was absolutely amazing. She took the time to explain the different services they were recommending for my car and helped me figure out which I should prioritize as well as to come up with a timeline for the work to be done on my car. This made the visit so cost effective, as I couldn’t afford to have all of the work they recommended done at once. She also signed me up for the loyalty program and explained all of the benefits without skipping a beat. While I was waiting for the work to be done she was very attentive to me as well as the other people waiting in the lobby, checking in periodically and giving ETAs and thanking us for our patience. Wanda definitely represents your brand well and should be commended for her service!

I would also like to recognize Mike, the mechanic. He was very nice and informative as well. When the service was done, he took the time to tell me about what he saw was going on with my car explained the work he’d done and explained some concerns he had about the way the car was driving and what he’d like to focus on for my next visit. I could tell he was being honest and really cared about the condition of my car as well as my safety driving it. He wasn’t judgy and he didn’t try to scare me into purchasing unnecessary products or services, as other mechanics have attempted in the past. Mike should be commended for his great work and care as well!

It was a great visit and I will definitely be back. Your staff has won me over and have gained a new loyal customer! Thanks again!< /Review>< Rating>

<text>Had a true rotation and balance March 15 2021 was fast and quick with great service

Had  to get two tires mounted and inflated on a large garden tiller that we bought on Amazon and when here because they were open early Sunday morning. They looked at the ties and wheels and said they would try it and they got them mounted and inflated and when I asked how much they said they would not charge me.
Great customer service and I will be back for brake service and ties and shocks as these were 3 very nice young men and they were very customer focused. More business should be like them< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>They got my tires rotated.  However they offered to replace my shocks and struts for a large sum of money.  I did the bounce test on my own along with some others to detect any hint of a problem and found the suspension to be plenty solid.  Plus I ride around in the car and feel every bump I see without any extra after nor does the car pick up any sort of vibration regardless of speed.  I also tried the bounce test on a different car I suspected to actually need this kind of work and that car bounced quite a bit, so I am pretty sure I did the test right on my car.  While it is true a car with the miles mine has will usually need this kind of work, my car does not need it yet, nor is it close to needing it.  If I am going to spend a lot of money doing work on my car, it better need it, not be sham maintenance.

Also this place always has really long waits for simple things like a tire rotation.  It would be nice if they staffed things a little better to keep the backlog down.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Good customer service, but technical knowledge seem to be lacking here. Used to be a big fan of this shop when they were on Green.  But lately they got me wondering about their ability since the move and the turnover in personnel.  They misdiagnosed a bad water pump for a leaking head gasket. And recently, they could not find two nails in my tire and one of them was about 5 inches long.<//review>

I was out of town and noticed I had a flat tire. Stopped at Discount Tire and they immediately tried to pump it up.  When it wouldn’t hold air, they offered to just put my spare on. When I didn’t have a spare, they offered me their best deal and had it replaced within an hour. Very friendly and professional.< /Text>

I replaced two tires at this location, the other two in Las Vegas. Any time I have a problem,  I drop in at this location and they take care of me regardless if it's on the tires I purchased from them or not. I've picked up nails twice and they were able to repair the tires. Great staff, I will always bring my business here.< /review>

I have to start by saying that I have gone to this shop for several years and have gotten several tires, alignments, and rotations here. I have always gotten decent prices, however as of late the customer service has gone down hill. Depending on who is managing that day, it can either be a pleasant and professional atmosphere or a lazy boys club. With that said, I'm writing this because I want this business to do well and improve their service. Hopefully, things improve before I have to come by next time.< /Text>

Mysterious charges were added to my final bill. Although I only came in to have my tire patched, I was also charged for a wheel balance, which I did not request and was not notified about. Check your invoice before you sign I guess. :\<//text>

Excellent service!  I went in with a nail in my tire.  They were able to determine that it went in at an angle such that it didn't damage the tire.  They spent almost an hour on my tire determining that it was not damaged (submerged in water, etc) and in the end as there was no repair to be done, did not charge me anything even though they had spent quite a bit of time on the diagnosis.</Review>

The staff in this branch give mechanics a bad name. They broke a part of my car and lied to me about it. Their corporate HQ eventually replaced the broken parts and refunded labor costs. Better to avoid these guys and to go elsewhere.</Text>

If I could give negative stars I would because no stars wouldnt even justify my experience.So I took my car in to the DT&SC in Pasadena because I had just gotten new parts on my front suspension but apparently the torque on the struts was incorrect hence why I took it in.. I get a quote from Richard that it needs a camber kit in the front and in the back. He quotes me $245 for the front and tells me he has to look for the one in the back so he would let me know what the damage would be tomorrow once he found it. So I call in and he’s going thru the numbers and then he says yea so the total is going to be $889 but I can let you out the door for $791. As you can imagine my jaw fell to the floor. I don’t know where he got that number from but he clearly was trying to rip me off.. I take my car home loosen the bolts on the strut and re tourque them and the problem was solved.. took it to Pep Boys in Tujunga because the one in Pasadena was trying to charge me for a new rack & pinion and there was absolutely nothing wrong with my rack & pinion.. so the guy puts it on for an alignment makes the proper adjustments and I’m out of there in an hour for free since I have life time alignments at Pep Boys and I’m back on the road.. I find it very disrespectful that these guys gave me such an over priced quote knowing it was a simple fix.. Thanks Richard and DT&SC for reminding me why I hate dealing with auto mechanic shops.. To those who may be reading this stay away from Richard and Discount Tires all together and always get a second and third opinion..<//Text>

<text>The wait for service to be done took awhile . It was well worth the wait and money I paid for service done . I drove around Pasadena price shopping for tires and wheel alignment . The Manager was super nice and respectful and gave me a deal I couldn't refuse. 4 stars because the coffee was cold in the break room and they had a Soap Opera playing .<//text>< Name>

When I made the reservation for tired the day before (expensive Perelli tires) I was told the price would be around $684 but when I arrived to get them installed I was told by Mike the cost was told it was $823 and all said was the person I spoke to have me the incorrect cost.....didn't try to work it out or anything. Be careful of this branch not as honorable as the Redlands branch.</text>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>Have received good service from Pasadena Discount Tire in the past so when they moved a couple miles north, we wanted to try them again.  Unfortunately, they were experiencing computer, printer and internet issues that slowed their service considerably.
So, part one of two reviews concerns counter service: Slow, but understandable considering computer glitches.  Suggestion:  Please don’t say ‘I’ll be with you in a minute,’ or ‘I’ll be right with you,’ when you know you’ll be much, much longer.  I know it’s a greeting and probably a habit to say that, but to customers, it’s insulting to wait 5-10-15 minutes when you’re promised ‘in a minute.’  Better to say
‘Welcome!’  ‘When I’m finish here, I’ll be with you.’

One of your service people answers your phone: ‘Discount Tires, how can I give you GREAT SERVICE?!!’  Wow!  That’s exciting to hear and makes you feel like you called the right place!
So, maybe your counter service people could say: ‘Welcome to Discount Tire.  When I’m finished here, I want to give you great service next!’  If these become your customer service habit, customers will feel like they came to the right place!

Part two of my review concerns my actual auto service.  I came in for an oil change for my Prius Plug In and felt like I could trust your service people.  They could not get the cap off that protected my oil filter.  So, they drained my oil and called me when the cap could not be removed.  So instead of breaking the cap and ordering another and charging me, plus keeping my car overnight, they put oil back in my car and suggested I go to the local Toyota dealer and have them loosen my cap.

I was so thankful and pleased with their honesty that I brought my other Prius in for an oil change the next day!!!  I felt like I came to the right place!  I give them a very good for the actual work on my cars!  Ken</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Classic scam, here I am, 9 months later, after having spent about $1500 on tires and brakes at Discount Tire Center in Pasadena on Walnut st. (Emitting a rant about the horrible vulture % on financing the $1500, luckily I was able to pay it off early, if not theres a huge penalty in missed payments or minimum payments, terrible)

Come to find out, the tires you put on are from 2015. 2015!?! I got them done in February 2018, so they were 3 years old at the time of purchase.

I mean this should be illegal. It probably is.

2 weeks ago, I scuffed a side wall. The unforgivable sin in the tire business, right dollar signs? Well, apparently I declined insurance (news to me) and they would do nothing ....nothing but take another $300 for a new tire.

Ok...so the guy tells me he would order one and call me the next day. Next day, no call, day after that, no call. Through the next week/weekend....no call. Tire blows out on a curb in the Subway parking lot on Washington (their driveway does suck, granted), I call....now it's no answer....well they have an answering service, but they never were able to connect me to the service center to talk to one of the guys who gave me lip service (bs) in person.

(In hindsight, their inability to communicate professionally saved me from doing business here again, so it was like a favor in disguise)

It does not stop here, but my review will soon end. The tow company was unable to change to my spare because of Stripped lug nuts!?!
Wait, the last people who worked on my wheels was Discount Tire Center in Pasadena, on Walnut! (There's no excuse for a stripped $1 lug nut) never did have air caps.... and now...my tire iron is missing. Gone, vamoos just like my money, and my patience. Oh I'm furious. Unprofessional. Unimpressed. Scam!< /Review>< pics>

I&#39;ve bought tires here for years (through a few changes of management and staff and for various vehicles) and had repairs done here as well. They have never ripped me off, and I can trust the work they do. What they fix stays fixed and problem-free.  I will take my future cars here as well.</text>

<Review>very disorganized. Had an appointment for 2pm, 45 min. passes before we wereTold to return in two hours, no problem, returned and saw my car on the rack, went outside. Waited for twenty minutes, car still on rack untouched. Guy tells me the guy went to work on another car, and they are finishing up now. That was 45 minutes ago. Since he asked me if I wanted the new tire on front I am not sure that was even done. Cannot get anyone to give me an update not sure why they have discount in their name, more expensive than pepboys, but they did good work in the past, had my loyalty, emphasize had.</Review>< Pics>

They seem to be professional, but unfortunately, they did not have the tires I was looking for in stock.</review>

<Text>I was shocked I had to pay  $ 120. Because I had a warranty and they can not pull a nail out of a tire. Why have a warranty?????. Next time I'll go to a tire shop and get a nail pulled $10  MAX.<//Text>< username>

Never actually got to get any work done. I verbally changed my appointment with the clerk and I was treated like a stranger, the next day when I came in for my appointment. Customer service was poor at this location. Seems like the place is being run by racist.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Definite service, good repair. Better to make a reservation in advance.

(Original)
확실한 서비스, 수리를 잘 합니다. 미리 예약하시면 보다 좋습니다.</review>

The employees were very professional and good about explaining their recommended repairs. The report they sent had photos and they walked me through each thing, then gave me time to think and accept on the report. When our car was going to take longer they gave me a loaner for the weekend. Very pleased with the service!</text>

From the first phone call inquiring about services and pricing, to getting my car back after work was complete, my experience at Connie and Dick’s exceeded my expectations. Oscar, who answered the phone and discussed the issues with me, was very thorough. And Sarah was so wonderful! As someone who has just moved to the area, I am so grateful to have found such a great mechanic!<//Text>

<Review>Great place to take your vehicle. They did an excellent job on my truck had it fixed in no time. Also the way they give you an estimate before you bring it in was very personal. I work over 12 hours a day and didn't have time to go during their business hours but I had the option of dropping my truck off when I got out of work and was able to pick it up when I had gotten out such a convenient way of operation. Thank you guys for all the help. You will be seeing me again for any future repairs.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

*New Customer*
Communication was a 5 star experience.
Calling Connie and Dick’s Service (C&DS) at 8am was like calling up an old buddy that is willing to listen to your car problems and provide positive responses. C&DS provided a brief discussion over how they can provide their best services to their new/returning customer.
Courtesy car pick up. 5 star experience
C&DS provided me with them picking up my car from work. No stress of dropping off my car and wondering how will I commute from their shop to work.
Precise car problem solutions. 5 star experiencce
I requested a Performance Analysis and Engine Oil Leak Analysis. With this service then they were able to provide me a window shopping experience of their prices to fix my problems. I came to them with my car shakes when I accelerate and make a hard turn onto a HWY ramp.
Discount without even asking for one. 5 star experience
I provided them with the pick-up location and was offered a discount without even asking for one.
Invoice instantly emailed. Invoice is a receipt and a list of repairs with prices attached (window shopping experience) and provided same day service with an appointment.</text>

I was so impressed with the professionalism and courtesy offered by Connie and Dick's. I came in to get my oil changed and brake pads replaced for the first time. They finished everything that afternoon and the prices were quite reasonable. I love that they photograph any issues they find and walk through their inspections. I'll definitely be making them my go-to for future services.< /Text>

< Review>
My experience has always been above excellence their customer service and work quality has been amazing. They have given me the best quote then any other company, and out of other places I’ve taken my car to there the only ones that could find the issue and fix it. This family owned auto service center is the only place I’ll have work on my vehicles or recommend / recommended to my family and friends. All I have to say is thank you for everything Cindy, Scott, Oscar, Richie, Sarah, Maegan, Jonathan, Louis, Steve and Andrew for all the work you’ve done to make my car safer for me to drive with my son.< /Review>

<review>Had our 2013 Chrysler 200 break down on the I-15, and based on the indicators -- the vehicle required service.  After talking with the AAA representative decided to have the vehicle towed to Connie & Dick's.  The service department was extremely helpful...and we had our car back in running conditions in to days.  Great service and extremely helpful Team.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Connie & Dicks did a fantastic job on my truck! I've used many mechanics in my days and I have to say they have been the best. They are very Professional very clean shop and very accurate with there pricing and service. They have the latest technology which is very helpful and useful in todays age. I have many vehicles and from this point on I will start utilizing this shop to perform and take care of my Automotive needs. Richie was great he was very thorough in his estimates and kept me up to date on the progress of the work being performed on my vehicle. Hands down I will completely recommend Connie & Dicks Auto service to all my friends and family.<//review>< pictures>

I always come here when I need service for my car. Everyone who works there is so kind and they are very quick to get your car serviced if you make an appointment. It’s also located conveniently right next to the Claremont village so you can walk around or get something to eat while you wait.<//Text>

We recently moved to the area and were looking for a new auto service center. I'm very happy we found Connie and Dick's. They are friendly, professional and competent. They are very detailed in their explanation of repairs, including pictures, and work with you to decide on what is critical and what can be done at a later time.<//Text>

<Review>Our family is a confirmed member of the Connie & Dick's fan club. My wife, daughter and I all take our vehicles to C&D's and we have never been disappointed in the excellent service they provide. Strongly recommend this auto service center. The personalized, quality service can't be touched by the auto bays of the large auto dealerships.</Review><Time>1510961625126< /Time>< Response>

Staff is excellent, they explain everything that they are doing to your car in detail and are very patient. Consistently great work, and well worth the price tag. I highly recommend them to everyone I know.< /Text>

I work for businesses all over SoCal.  It's always great to deal with people that know their stuff. Honest answers and customer satisfaction is a priority .  That's exactly what I found in dealing with Connie & Dick's Auto Service Center.  These guys have been at this a long time.  When a shop is this busy they are doing something right!  Thanks guys!< /Review>

I had a spark plug blow out which I was able to fix on my own.  After the repair my Sequoia wouldn't start.  After exhausting everything I could do I had to have the truck towed to Connie and Dick's.  This was my first time there and I chose them based on online reviews.  I could not be happier.  I was concerned that there was internal engine damage from the exploding spark plug and they could have easily told me that was thousands of dollars in repairs and I wouldn't have doubted it.  Instead, they said a couple of fuses blew as a safety feature and only charged me for the diagnostic .  Thank you, you will have a return customer for sure</text>

<text>My cars have been serviced by Connie and Dick's Service Center for more than 20 years and I can say that they are HONEST, friendly, thorough and are able to take care of old or new cars.  On top of that, they are available, at a moments notice, to provide service advice and perform minor repairs.

The only time that I went anywhere else, because they were closed, my air conditioning system was ruined by the other garage and Connie and Dick's had to repair the mistake.  After that incident, if I have a problem when they're closed I wait until they're open.

I most heartily recommend them.</text>< Pics>

Trust is what it’s about.....and I trust Connie and Dicks!

I always receive prompt, friendly, appropriate service here for my 12 year old car, making it reliable and trustworthy too!      (thanks, Oscar)

Ps.   I also like that they choose to support the community—e.g. sponsoring Rotary’s Taste of Claremont fundraiser in the spring.< /review>

< response>
{'time': 1445274399171, 'text': "Hi Steven,\n\nWe're sorry that you disagree with our position regarding customer supplied parts. There are numerous reasons as to why a professional business would elect NOT to install a customer supplied part. In the order of importance, here are a few to consider:\n\n1. Liability - we are responsible for the proper repair of the vehicle.\n2. Safety - we do everything in our power to assure our customers that quality parts & service are always delivered whenever we service their vehicle.\n3. Quality - today, parts quality varies tremendously. If a part on a vehicle fails @80k miles, the replacement part should be able to provide at least the same amount of service. Many of the parts sold today are extremely challenged to stand up to that calling. This is why we are extremely picky as to the parts we choose to install."}< /response>

<Review>AWESOME SERVICE! After making the mistake of going to the local metro honda (oscar from c&D found a transmission dip stick that wasn't inserted properly... WHAT) i decided to come here. This is a piece of advice for anyone when they are going into a autoshop, something I learned this time around.... DO SOME RESEARCH OF YOUR PROBLEM!!! if you go into the shop with a rough idea, these guys are awesome! if not, you are tempting them to take advantage.... (not that they would do it, but it's kind of your fault) very very reasonable prices, clean, fast, and courteous... what more can you ask for?< /Review><UserId.>109075423365197969810< /UserId.>< gmapID>

What a shame it is to have to deal with businesses like this. You don't have too, just take time to shop around. I called today and talked with Oscar and I told him I had a slow leak in my tire, since I was in Claremont, I thought I would use a Claremont business. Well after he told me it would be $30 and he told me that is because of the bells and whistles (paraphrasing), I moved on. I live in Rancho Cucamonga but I new of an independent tire shop in Fontana and a couple of years ago, they fix my tire for $10, so I went there and they still fix tire for $10 today, wow, that is what I call a great company. No gouging here and rotation is $15, very good prices. There will always be people like the first one, but we can always choose to find a more fair service.<//text>

Proper repair involves removing the tire from the rim, inspection, prep, patch, remount, rebalance, and reinstall the wheel on the vehicle."}<//Response>

<Review>No over the phone quote?!?  And almost $200 to diagnose something when I already knew the problem!  What a joke!  I'm sure it's because I'm a woman and they figure, what would I know.  So I took it elsewhere where the whole repair cost only $300 and half of that went to the parts.  Only $150 for labor.  I'm sure Dick's and Connie's would of quoted me much higher and hence they would not quote me.  Losers!  Females and the vulnerable, take your business elsewhere.  Call Pepboys for your free quotes and get the real going rates.  And never take your business where they won't quote you.  Hahahahha, that's very funny in today's market.  $200 for a quote, hahahahahahaha....</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>
{'time': 1341424610028, 'text': "It is professional industry standard practice to properly analyze and research any issue prior to recommending repairs. Quoting on something over the phone is not something a professional will do. A quote covering analytical time, in this case $200, is fair and BTW is a max which often times is not reached and not charged if not needed.\n\nSorry we were not able to meet your expectations.\n\nCindy Brown - Owner & Manager of Connie & Dick's Service Center Inc."}</response>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I've been coming here for years.  The owners are friendly.  The smoothies and drinks are delicious.  I especially love their milk tea with boba (tapioca) and their avocado smoothie.  Their milk tea is made from actual tea and not from powder like a lot of places.  I've referred many people here and they agree that this place is delicious.  They're right next to 24 hour fitness.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Way too expensive!!!  Over $8 for only three fruits... would’ve cost over $12 by the time I added in a few more items to make it how I wanted it. I’ll keep going to Ever Bowl - same size without the up-charge for topping choices. Not to mention, there’s too much ice blended with the açaí making it very bland and watery - definitely not worth the money. Two stars because the girl behind the counter was nice :/</Text></record>

<Text>Juice is awesome! Well made and clean facility. The reason I give three stars is because of the service. I tend to order a juice specifically that takes longer to make because it is fresh squeezed. Every time I walk in I feel like the workers see me as a burden because they don’t want to make this drink. I am only in here a few times a week at the most. I am giving my business and don’t feel appreciated as a customer. They always make a point as well to make my juice after other customers who ordered after me.< /Text>< pictures>

This place has the best 50/50 bar smoothie that i have found. Think its called an orange squeeze. I have been coming here for a long time whenever im in the area and its always good. Its family owned and operated and they are always nice and the prices are good. i hope this place never closes because no one beats them for what I like.</review>

Support local businesses. And still the best acai bowl. Always fresh. The fresh juices are on point. If you feel like a lemonade, but desire a tropical twist - get the passion fruit juice. Not too sweet nor sour. Packed with nutrition!</Text>

The size of the item itself leads you to think that it'll be filling, but they add in quite a bit of ice into the acai to essentially make it an acai smoothie.

It's very watery, very little acai flavor. The best part of this was the fruit and granola but that's the best part of ANY acai bowl. On top of that it was $8.

The staff are also not very welcoming and you can tell the owners that work here don't like their jobs.

Only rating this two stars because their boba drinks are good (but I haven't been to a boba place that serves bad beverages, really).<//review>< gmap_id>

<text>Tried the Acai bowl today and was kind of let down... $7.25 for an oversized cup (not a bowl) and was lacking some ingredients I have had elsewhere. No tangy zip to the flavor and the all but scarce granola felt old and bland. The place I normally go has a real bowl with a healthy serving of acai base, sliced banana, strawberry, blueberry and raspberry, covered in granola, shredded coconut and topped with bee pollen... for about $6 and change after tax. So.... sadly, rethinking my return here.</text>< pics>

If you are looking for roast beef forget it, they don't carry it anymore. I like the old club sandwich with roast beef. Guess another place I can forget about going to.< /Text>

<review>Best subway I’ve been to in a while. Great customer service too. Only downside is that they don’t have a restroom but no big deal. Fresh bread and the breakfast was really surprisingly delicious. You can eat outside on the patio too.

I ordered thru the phone & reviewed my order w/Diego who was helping me w/my order.  Customer service was wonderful. I picked up my order & tipped Diego personally. Low and behold... my order was missing items I requested & paid for. I was not able to return to have my order corrected. Very disappointed. Other than this mishap ... customer service was good... the establishment was orderly & clean.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I was staying with my cousin in Costa Mesa and wanted something to eat late at night. He told me about the local Subway so we went.  This was one of the best subways i have been too.  It wasn't just a fast food place but one of the nicest i been into. It was clean and the staff was really friendly and warm. They quickly greeted and was enjoying my sub right away.  It was nice to see a 24 hour Subway since in my town there isn't one.  A few days later we did a catering from this subway for a house party.  The food came right on time and was just as good as when we sat down and ate it.  Everything tasted and looked great.  I will be returning to this Subway any time that i go visit my family there.<//Review><date>1406869742857<//date>< username>

<text>Favorite Subway by far! I generally order for delivery because it's hard to find time for lunch due to our busy hours. First off I have been to location (generally on my free time) and must say it's very well kept. The employees do an awesome job cleaning up the tables, restocking utensils, napkins, drinks and food is always fresh. Plus this location is open 24 hours! Major bonus points right there.

Subway is my favorite fast food chain. This location is located on Fairview and Wilson in Costa Mesa. They provide free local delivery. Unfortunately, I do not qualify but the delivery cost which very reasonably affordable. During the busy season (summer), getting a lunch hour is often time difficult. I generally put in order for delivery. There are many great choices like - the sandwich platters, humongous giant subs, and chewy cookies for dessert. We generally go with the "Classic Combo Platter" and "Customize Your Own Platter".

Ordering is made easy, either through the website or calling in. A regular sized platter feeds about 5-9 people. The custom platters can come with up to 5 different flavored sandwiches! I can go on and on about how much Subway Costa Mesa is the best around.

I look forward to my next catering order from Subway Costa Mesa.</text>< Pics>

Try one of our giant subs the next time you need a catering order, I'm sure you won't be disappointed by the staffs attention to detail.  We bake our cookies 5-6 different times throughout the day, so that is the main reason our cookies always taste so soft & chewy.

<Review>Started eating here 3 years ago, when it had a hobby store next door.  Remained a loyal customer because it's good food, clean and open 24/7.  Met the owner and his wife, good people that really care about the service and food quality.

I was looking for a fast food chain that was healthy and had good reviews. Subway was one of my options. It's awesome that they are open 24 hours a day. It's convenient because I get out of work late. The catering option is always a good plan for family and work events. It's easy and not much to clean up. The staff is very friendly and the manager always has a warm smile on his face. This is my favorite Subway by far. Don't forget to get a warm white chocolate macadamia cookie on your way out.</review>

< review>
Very, very disgusted from this location's workers. I went in with my daughter to get a sandwich . The young white man that tried to toast a bun burnt our food and had the nerve to say that is how it is cooked. I may not be a genius but if it smells and looks like its burnt bread its burnt bread.To also receive his continuous eye rolls and back talk because he does not know how to toast bread is also very alarming.He then said I can refuse the right to service to anyone because we did not want have to pay for a burnt sandwich....  If that  person was representing my company I would be mortified in levels of stupidity you must require to be upset and refuse service to someone over YOUR OWN MISTAKE.  How unprofessional,  racist , belittling , unintelligent do have to be to make a sandwich?Apparantly go to Subway in Costa Mesa on Fairview road and you will find out. Congrats Subway you picked a real winner.< /review>

WARNING ALERT, All customers be aware of their BATHROOM POLICY. When entering this location, you must first place your order before the staff will relinquish the Bathroom Key. YES, that is their policy.
Implimented by the Owner of this location.
All Subways are independently owned and operated therefore they can make up their own rules.
Obviously, this Rule is very important to this location.
I'm not going back to this place again. Thank you Bathroom police, I'll eat at a friendlier location.

{'time': 1474689184626, 'text': 'Hi Dean,\n\nWe have had to implement this policy due to the extensive homeless/loitering issue that has arisen over the last several years.  Our restroom was left unlocked for many years for all to use, but with individuals coming in and causing thousands of dollars in damage and rampant drug use, policies had to be changed.  When the restroom was left unlocked, homeless individuals try to sleep in the restroom through the entire night...all the way to have people overdose while sitting on the toilet.  This policy was put into place not to punish, but to keep everyone SAFE.  Guests and staff members alike.  We have had a drastic decrease in vandalism and drug use after implementing this policy; it was put in place by owner, managers and staff all agreeing that safety comes first.  We apologize for the inconvenience the policy now causes, but it will remain in place.'}< /Resp>

<review>I went to this subway because it was open 24 hours. I needed a last minute catering order and they were happy to help me out. The people working there were terrific. I waited for my order and just observed the people working there. They seamed to genuinely care about the place. They were quick to clean up the tables so there was always a clean place for people to sit. Thank you for taking the time to make my visits great. They are a cut above the rest of the subways and other fast food that I have gone to.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The staff here are all very professional, helpful and keen to assist.   Food preparation is right on the mark and the wait, even when crowded is minimal.   Employee's are all well trained and know their product and services.

The restaurant itself is always spotless w/ employees constantly attentive to that point.  I must give a shout out to the ownership team in knowing thouroughly what makes for an enjoyable eating experience.  Plus as everybody already knows, the price is always right.

All in all, if you find yourself in the Costa Mesa- Fairview Rd area,  you owe it to yourself and will never regret coming in and enjoying the wide assortment of sub's at this particular Subway location.<//review><resp>{'time': 1407895214197, 'text': "Hi Gil,\n\nThank you for your kind words sir!

I no longer live in the area but I wouldn't return to a location where the manager rolls their eyes and acts as if she could care less for your business.  There are several other places within walking distance to eat, I suggest you try those.< /Review>

When I went, a very sweet and kind girl by the name of Azayla helped me with my sub while a girl next to her pumped out a 12-order sub. Very happy with the service, especially Azayla's soft and genuine concern for the integrity of my order. Overall, I am very impressed by their teamwork to help all of us who had - to their dismay - piled in at the same time. I would love to come back again, and I believe the same goes for the customers who stood beside me. Thank you for your unselfish concern for the well-being of the customers, despite the lack of man-power available at the time.</review>

May 4, 2017. Dont go to this subway. I always go to subway and decided to stop by this one to use the restroom and they denied me using it without making a purchase. That is not customer service. I have spent enough money at subway to be able to the their bathroom for free, for life.</Text>

I had heard of this wondrous place they call, the Subway. I took the path and it lead me to a glorious isle of colour. Behold we found meats in an array of every brown and red delight imaginable. I saw vegetables blooming in a rainbow of red, green, and orange. The Heavens opened up and presented a footlong delicious feast before my eyes. So many choices I didn't know where to begin. Choosing the jalapeno bread and Italian BMT, I sat at my booth like a king...for tonight we feasted with the gods. A meal worthy of few, yet affordable for all.

For my next quest, I must meet the legend they call Jared...<//Text>

<Text>Not necissarily bad service but Very slow. After waiting 20+ minutes behind one customer (who was only ordering two subs btw) I was able to: get in my car, drive a half a mile to another fast food restaurant, order, pay and recieve my food all in under 10 minutes. If you're really craving it, heads up you might have to wait longer than you'd expect.</Text><gmapID>0x80dcdf9dfaf344e7:0x99f13580763ac7a8<//gmapID><rating>2</rating></record>

{'time': 1508447567815, 'text': "Customer requested a breakfast sandwich after breakfast hours had ended.  Store manager, Sheena, handled the situation in the same manner she would handle all requests for breakfast after this time period (you can take any regular menu sandwich and add egg  to the sandwich).  Customer was made aware that the sandwich would not be priced as breakfast sandwich, but be a dollar more with the coupon that customer brought in with him ($6 for the footlong + $1 additional for the egg).  Customer became upset because the sandwich was not $6 once approaching the cash register.   Mr. Big Bad Wolf was contacted by owner to resolve the issue, and a free sandwich was offered, but that was due to the inconvenience he faced and for his feedback to speak with us.  Not to 'buy' his way back into our restaurant or dodge the 'real' issues.  Customer was informed that this was a simple training matter that needed to be addressed with Sheena and entire morning staff, which it was, and now entire staff is on the same page.  Mr. Big Bad Wolf, how would you like the issue handled?"}< /Resp>

<time>1508548121663< /time><Review>I had the displeasure of dealing with Sheena at this location.  I verified with her, BEFORE placing my order, that my coupon could be used and at the time of checkout she stated that she couldn't honor the coupon that she just ok'd five minutes before.  She then got an attitude with me for questioning the sudden change, talked over me repeatedly and then she just walked off leaving me and another customer waiting to pay.

The franchise owners only solution, for her behavior, was to give me a free sandwich instead of addressing the "real" issue, which is her attitude and how she reacted to the situation unprofessionally.  What you should do Mr. Balkar, is tell the WHOLE truth and not just what sounds good to potential patrons.... its called integrity!  No worries, we wont be returning to your location.</Review><Name>Mr Wolf< /Name></record>

I wanted to write a review for this subway by the oc fair.  I came in really late so it was convenient that they had 24 hour service.  The staff was really friendly and accomadated all the quirks I put in my sandwich.  The place was really clean and the smell of baked bread filled the store from a catering event the were putting together.  My new go to subway.</Text>

Can they go any slowerrrrrrr. This girl clearly didn't know the quantity of each meat and cheese to place on a sub. She put 4 meatballs in a 6inch. So rude and slow.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I like going to that Subway because it is closer to my house ... but the boy who attended me, is very unpleasant, I do not know his name because he does not have on his shirt ... I wish he was a little kinder like the other employees ...

(Original)
Me gusta ir a ese Subway porqué esta mas cerca de mi casa.. pero el muchacho que me atendió,  es muy poco agradable, no se su nombre porque no tiene en su playera... ojalá fuera un poco más amable como los demás empleados...< /Review>

Although we didn't eat at this place, this place is noticable from driving by and small. Today was a rainy day so great day to eat pizza or hot foods. No parking unless you park on the green curb on the side. I ordered 2 Medium Calzones for me and my sister, I think it's an okay price for a Medium, especially when I first saw it, thinking it's a XL. The only small thing is that when I first took a bite of mine, it felt kind of salty but after that, it was fine. My sister said that it has too much sauce, her Calzone broke when pushing it in. Where as I noticed that it was pretty much empty if you got it all puffy, expecting it to be filled with cheese and pepperoni like a hot Pocket. To enjoy it, you'd have to smash it like a tortilla, not literally, but basically like a quesadilla. Not the Calzone I remember from middle school, but I does it job.</Review>

Ive seen this place while on the blue line, and I recently enjoyed a large Hawaiian pizza and 6 piece buffalo wings with my family and it was absolutely delicious! we parked on the street, plenty of parking when we arrived, great price for the large and great tasting pizza and the wings were large and delicious, will definitely return. super close to the train station too!! that's a plus!< /text>

THE BEST PIZZA! Hands down...and there are a LOT of hands. I was very skeptical when my sister (Hana J.) mentioned we try. But pizza sounded good on a cold rainy night, so we went for it. She called ahead (thank goodness), cuz if we didn't, we'd have to wait a long long time. By the time we got to the place, our pizza was in the works, and I think we only waited about 20 min max. The guy makes all the pizzas by hand, by himself, in this crazy small shop. He's super friendly and sweet. He tries to remember people's names too, for future visits!Maximo's Pizza<//Text>

I Remember Going Here After School Back In 2010, When They're Calzones Were ONLY $3.00, The Inital Spot Was Located Down The Street In Their Backyard 💯👌
Never The Less Best Calzones In S.C L.A
All Meat Or Whatever You Wanted In That Calzone For Only $3.00 Back In 2010'
Good Old Days !</Review>

< review>
Got the $5 small pepperoni calzone which was surprisingly, pretty big. That being said, it was the worst calzone I’ve ever tasted. Dough was thin and didn’t taste good, the calzone only had 3 pepperonis inside, and the cheese was bland. It was so bad that I didn’t even it the whole thing and ended up throwing it out.

They get a 3 for being cheap and having large portions.

I did not try the pizza so it may/may not be good.<//review>

They just changed the prices !!!

This is a resort we like to go to, over and again, especially for spring skiing. Everything is so well done, lots of Covid safety rules, enforced by the lift operators. Good grooming keeps enough trails open to make it fun. Base village has reopened so plenty of food choices too. Pass works at Alpine Meadows which is smaller, quieter, very scenic. Worth a day for sure.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Our first visit and first time spring skiing as well.  The ski area is great.  The easier slopes higher on the mountain are really good, large and plenty of trails to learn quickly.  The blue slopes are challenging with different terrain in the mix.  I would definitely recommend Squaw/Olympic Valley for Every level of skier.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjVlaFTrByo8gwyyOK9BDWoT_DNZLCjvkaxa5g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfXUKTLhCMl58NEkVeWLjuQck9f3HDuUbyVvde=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4DUXBWiElSpui5QFoo9XfxA3chi-DOibEFVxc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Love Squaw!  The grooming could be better though.  Lift operators are so helpful.  Ski Patrol everywhere.  Bathrooms are so new and clean!!  Lots of lifts and runs!  Wish they allowed overnight parking in the parking lots.  Urgent care on site.  Beautiful ski village and great and plentiful restaurants.  Great cell reception.  Covid careful ~ masks required, take out food and 25% capacity limit.</Review>

And great progression park at Belmont lift. One lift dedicated for the small park is great for practicing small feathers. I have never seen any other like this in Lake Tahoe.</review>< Pictures>

Still expensive but the mountain is big enough that it helps. They started spring hours so they are only open till 2 or 3 but the snow was getting pretty grippy so it's probably for the best. Can't beat $50 Wednesdays either</review>

<review>Always great starting at the Squaw Valley Lodge, especially with the kitchen amenities. The staff is super nice and helpful, and it's also nice to have covered parking for your vehicle during your stay so you don't have to brush off snow! Can't beat the ski-in ski-out either.<//review>< pics>

One of the best ski resorts in the Tahoe area, and one of the biggest. But it does get crowded, like pretty much every other resort.</Text>

Lots of options for any level. I really enjoy skiing the Backside/ Granite Chief chair especially now in the spring. There is a nice balance of groomed and ungroomed terrain.< /review>

Short lines, open slopes. If you feel even a little bit of something...stay away! I rode the chair with a man that kept clearing his throat, at least 12 times, and it made me wonder....???? This People, is what we are talking about...!!! Had a great day, going b-a-c-k tomorrow...< /Text>

<rating>2</rating><Text>One of the best resorts in Tahoe to ski/snowboard, but the mountain just isn't worth $240 a day. Hate that they are making it this expensive to get up on the mountain. A single burrito costs $16 and it's super basic. Way too expensive for mediocre experiences. I would recommend flying to Europe at these prices. The snow is better, amazing après, and great food - raclette for days! Check out La Folie Douce in Chamonix.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKBAxjQ2DFlp9lSWGPyBKowz9MWWr7frONN777=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY_o1eZjva8MZ8jsB42lZa90WEfkx-SlqqqQ0L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPausAn2MZfKQmgbOXQHDzn5819kCjvPgne1XuW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Excellent ski resort close to the Reno Tahoe area. Famous for hosting the olympics many years ago. BEAUTIFUL VIEWS ALL AROUND!!! Great terrain for skiing here, tons of different lifts with dozens of runs all over the mountain. Lift lines are not too bad, but can be long during the busy weekends. Plenty of parking if you get there early in the AM. Lots of very difficult runs when the snow is good. Looking forward to skiing it more this winter season as well as Alpine Meadows just down the road.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Love the Squaw Valley Resort. Highly recommend this resort. Walking distance to the slopes, shopping and most of all, true resort luxury and tranquility.

Moved to this resort from Lake Tahoe Resort by Diamond, which was a disaster, which was a timeshare on life support trying to stay alive by renting the units, charging a resort fee like Vegas and a $100 a day additional deposit they use for 2 weeks as a slush fund.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Beautiful mountains, great slopes. It was a little too late to go in April, will try March next time. The only issue we have had was when my daughter’s ski went backwards when she was getting off the lift, she fell twisting her knee, the chair ran over her and hit her in the head. The operator did not stop it on time, it kept going for another 3-4 seconds after she fell. When it finally stopped I and my husband had to jump down off the chair because it already went the other way. When we used the same lift later that day the operator was playing with his phone and not even looking at us. I was surprised because all other operators were staying next to the lifts and helping people to get off them.<//Text>< Rating>

Try to buy season pass 21-22 with active nurse license from ticket office. They say they cannot sell the pass with discount at ticket  office only through online. But the discount verification process was not possible  through  online. So why the discount announcement is there?< /Text>

<review>Squaw is a great resort, lots of opportunities for beginners to learn in the beginner slopes or with the classes and for the more experienced skiers there are lots of hard and off trail slopes. There are plenty of restaurants to eat at after the skiing. The biggest issue with squaw is that everything is very expensive, from the tickets to the food, to the houses and rentals.<//review>< pics>

I'm not a skier, but I love to stay here during the summer for hiking. The location is perfect for accessing most Tahoe trails. Prices are much more reasonable during the summer, and especially during the fall. The place is pretty dead in the fall. Most shops are closed, and restaurants are inconsistently open. And, for god sake, shop before you get there. Alice's Grocery is like shopping in Switzerland. Prices are ridiculous. Avoid that place like the plague.</Text>

Fun and not as packed as other resorts in the area. Good lift options but a lot of get backs and parking is really restrictive.</text>

Not because I grew up skiing Squaw Valley my whole life, but because they have actually done a great job to make the area safe during this covid time. So glad I took a day off midweek to avoid crowds! Friendly people, safe conditions, and beautiful scenery as always!<//review>

We have visited the resort by the end of August. It is a center for winter sports. But I liked it a lot. We have rented bikes and rode along Truckee river. The view is great right outside/back of the hotel. They have a very good swimming pool, as well. We had a room with a kitchenette. Rooms were clean, more like a studio apartment.<//Text>

This is my favorite ski resort in the Tahoe area, but the $220 adult price for even mid-week tickets during the President's Day week (Tuesday and Thursday) is obnoxious. Yes you can save if you buy a four pack, but that only works out if you want to only ski at this resort.  I have to admit, I now miss Alex Cushing...< /Text>

There wasn't a ton of snow, but Squaw was still a blast. The runs are super fun and well maintained. There's a wide range of accessibility from easy to super challenging. Also, everyone working there was super friendly, from Ski patrol, to information, to the lift operators. I feel like it's a little confusing to find the entrance from the main ski lot, but if you just keep trekking through the village, you'll find the base. Can't wait to come back when there's fresh snow and I can hit the trees!< /review>

<Text>Squaw Valley Resort (soon to lose its name) is the quintessential mountain resort.  Lodging, shopping, dining added to the ultimate draw of a mountain snow-sport experience in winter and hiking, trail running, and other outdoor sports in summer.  Olympic history, world class training opportunities, and unmatched scenery make it a must-see if ever in the North Tahoe area.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Response>

Beautiful place!
Not giving 5 stars because of the rentals, the staff there is extremely rude and not helpful at all...only at the rental area. Rest of the staff is good.</text>

< review>
Had made a reservation a week in advance for April 28th at 90$. During the day they made an announcement that they were shortening lift operations and reducing the price to 50$. There was not way I could have known or be notified of this change and upon calling the ticket office they refused to refund me even partially. Incredibly frustrating experience. Nowhere in the itinerary or ticket contract does it say they are allowed to do this.< /review>

Great skiing at Squaw valley! Beautiful mountain, lots of parking, tons of shops, restaurants a d bars at the base. Add to that a giant mountain with a wide range of skiing choices from pleasant groomed cruising to crazy steep, through the trees powder skiing. Nice lifts and gondolas. Well maintained and clean. A+ experience!< /text>

I always have a great time here when I make it out to the Tahoe area.  Plenty of parking for carpooling (3+) and otherwise.  I also like the variety of shops and restaurants as well.  Extremely military friendly discount on season passes too!  You will enjoy this place.  Siberia runs are my favorite and they were able to open Siberia Express today.<//Text>

Olympic Valley, classic winter destination, under new management. Past few years services and lifts have been dumbed down on weekdays but they are stepping up their game with new food and beverage standards and tons of fun extra curricular. Nestled in a picturesque valley with multiple peaks viewing to Tahoe and beyond. Get up here and feel it for yourself. Winter magic! Disco tubing Saturday’s. You can do it! Epic lights show. Tally ho!<//Review>

I think this is the best ski resort in Tahoe. Variety of slopes for all levels plus it has great facilities. Only downside is the cost. The are very expensive, not just the lift tickets, but rental and food (which was not so god), but we are here for the snow...< /text>

Top notch skiing facility. Dozens of runs, good lifts, and helpful staff. The views from the tram to High Camp are amazing. Whatever your proficiency level, Squaw Valley has you covered, from beginner (green) to pro/expert (double black diamond). And if you've never skied or snowboarded before, lessons are available.< /Review>

Aaron Tippet the events manager is a top notch human. Love working with him. They have music and fireworks every Saturday. Also Laser tubing. Not to mention the skiing and boarding is world class. Eat at one of the many restaurants in the village, my favorite is the Nectar spot, the wraps are DELICIOUS. Be sure to take a ride in the tram and head up to high camp. While you're there check out the Olympic museum or grab some food.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Came after a storm on March 2nd and the pow pow was insane. There was no much snow at Siberia bowl run it was crazy. I literally couldn't see anything so when I fell I just fell on clouds cause it was so powder. It was definitely worth it tho I would suggest going after storm days and bringing good low light overcast goggles if it's cloudy or snowing.</Review>< username>

One of my favorite ski resorts!  I spent some time in the Reno / Tahoe area, and this is one of the most amazing areas to visit.  The Olympic village is the heart of the resort.</Text>

Second time boarding. This doesn't have much beginner terrain for first timers but it was still a great spot. Lots of food and drink places nearby on site and also when you take gondola higher.<//review>

< Review>
Love the squaw valley resort! When the villages 100% open it's a great place to go and hang out and browse around especially during the winter time during ski season. Wish I could afford to stay there though but it's always great to go visit and shop and get great food. Had a great recent trip to Tremigo this summer. Great Mexican food in the village. Can't wait to visit again when things get back to normal.< /Review>

First time snowboarding in this part of the world and wasn't expecting it to be quite this good. Enormous variety of terrain... nice vibe on the slopes and here's a clue; the most challenging runs come down underneath the slowest lift.<//text>

<userid>106702810914006292937<//userid><Review>This was my first time skiing ever, and luckily I got to ski with my daughter and her friend.

We went to Squaw Valley, one of the best Ski resorts in Tahoe. We were there on March 8, 2020. There was a lot of snow, which made Squaw more charming.

Squaw has plenty of parking and everyone working in squaw so friendly and professional. I was lucky to get Mr. Haz Nabulsi as my ski instructor. He is kind, funny, patient, and loves his job,  He made me feel like I’m with my brother the whole time I was skiing. I did fall a few times but I had a lot of fun. The best feeling was at the end when I took off my ski boots. :)

I love nature, and Mr. Nabulsi showed me all of the mountains on Lake Tahoe and even told me the name of each mountain. I highly recommend him to whoever is new to skiing. Thanks to Mr. Haz Nabulsi.

I plan to come back next year!<//Review><response>None<//response>< pics>

I just love Squaw Valley. I'm unfortunately physically incapable of skiing or participating in snow sports but the pleasure was insane. I've been a few times now and count it a privilege. Such a precious and beautiful part in the world. Blessed to see it, do go if you've opportunity, nothing was disappointing.</Review>

<Time>1552511471738<//Time><Review>Beautiful mountain. Plenty of runs for the advanced snowboarder. When I went, the visibility was awful but I was still able to have a good time. I really like the glades under red dog. When it is windy, they close the upper mountain for good reason, it is impossible to see and scary. But fun nonetheless.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUZewWqv3PiBpX_OkgOprJRXxTpwmMqn3Ei_np=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><rate>5<//rate></record>

I highly recommend this resort. Snow came early this year. There weren't many groomed runs and the ones we went on were icy. But the ungroomed areas were amazing! Not all the runs were open but we were able to hike up a run and ride down on powder. Such an azming day!!<//Text>

Amazing expert ungroomed runs! Some of the chairs are slow (1960) but worth the long ride for those runs!</Text>

I am a owner and I stay here throughout the year. In winter they have a lift right from the hotel to the squaw mountain. The squaw mountain is beautiful, and for beginners and advanced use. At night the hotel has the prettiest sunset, in winter and summer. They have amazing activities such as, ice skating, hot tub and pool, and more. In the summer there is a golf course, a pool, crafts for kids, a bar, and much more. The only problem is if you want to get to a lake you have to drive a 15 minute drive there. But, have you ever seen a hotel with a lake and a lift to the mountain? I didn’t think so. On thing that really made my trip here awesome was the restaurants. They have Sandy’s Pub, Sweet Potatoes deli, I don’t know the name but a buffet, Montagna, and the most memorable place Six Peaks. This is so memorable by the sunset right next to you, the beautiful view, delicious food, and just the magical feeling of it. Another thing to add is they have adult and kid shops where you would find Sweet Potatoes. Overall this place is amazing for summer and winter please come her on you next trip to Tahoe<//Review>

Great place for summer hiking in Tahoe. If you're looking to take a tram for "high-up" views during the summer, choose Squaw Valley over Heavenly. You can get quality lake views at free lookouts around the lake. You can't get mountain/meadow views like you get at the top of the tram at Squaw.

Last tram returns to the base village at 5:30pm so plan ahead. There's a ton of family friendly hiking at the top, and a small restaurant at the top too (although restaurants at the base village are probably better). Be sure to check out the Olympic museum!</Text>

Lift ticket prices are inflated here like most other resorts. Chili cheese fries are a good value, ton of calories for 11 bucks. Skiing was good but not all lifts running, could have more staff for the price of a pass to run more chairs.</review>

< review>
Overall it's great! Best meal by far at PlumpJack ...did social distancing well and great food and service.  Alice's Market is a place we won't go back to...grump guy and he wanted a tip because we bought canned/bottled beverages from him and he didn't even provide bottle opener.  Coffee bar excellent and Starbucks great.  Great ambiance...Mind Play is excellent toy store.< /review>

<user_name>Matthew Kilgore</user_name><text>Classic Sierra crest ski resort that loves to stay open as late into summer as possible, July 4th weekend closing is normal.

<Text>The resort was excellent, and the rooms very well furnished. We had a two bedroom suite that included a king bed in one room and a full size bed in the second, with a pull out couch in the living room. Living room had beautiful views of the mountain, a very nice fireplace, and a full kitchen.
We were literally steps from the tram going up mountain in the morning, which made skiing and returning to the rooms very easy. There is indoor parking,  an elevator,  two hot tubs in the building, an exercise room, and various firepits spread through the resort.
On the negative side, food at the restaurant was fairly expensive since this is resort so I would recommend taking advantage of the kitchen and preparing at least some meals in. I also rented skis for 3 days, and the rental cost me $150. You may want to consider renting your equipment locally rather than at the resort.
Overall, I had a great time and we'll definitely do it again.< /Text>< pictures>

I have been an avid supporter of Squaw valley not only as a visitor but as skier.

If the name is changed I will never set foot on your property.
This is an iconic venue with Olympic status.
To change the name would be a crime. We need to evaluate the crisis going on and make decisions that are not made due to pressure.< /Text>

<text>Yay! I'm not normally a fan of the rain, but it brought fresh powder this year! It kind of sucks though as the snow covered a lot of the parking and it is limited if you don't get there early.

Finally got to the slopes and I took the tram to the higher part of the mountain. The view is super pretty and the snow was great. There was a lot of people on the weekend but not super annoying where you feel like everyone is constantly in your way. The staff is nice and the lines go by quickly.

Overall, I enjoyed snowboarding here. Lift tickets and rentals were expensive though! It almost $150 for lift and $50 for rentals. Eeeks!< /text>< Pictures>

Some people complain about the price of a lift ticket. Don't listen to those curmudgeons! You get soooo much mountain!!!! The village is also fun and lively and great for meeting people.  And it's beautiful here,  truly beautiful.</review>

<text>Squaw Valley! Home to the 1960 Winter Olympics! So you also get access to Alpine Meadows with your lift ticket but I didn't have time to check it out. The resort is hugely spaced out with lots of open runs and wide open powder bowls. I will say that compared to Heavenly and Northstar, the runs are mostly shorter. There are some VERY advanced areas though, so if you want some challenging runs they definitely have them. The village is pretty nice, not as nice as Northstar's but has a better apres.<//text></record></dataset><record>

One of the larger resorts in Tahoe. Good option especially if you have the Ikon pass or are looking to ski into the spring. Instructors are a bit hit-and-miss if you take lessons ... many strong, some weaker.<//review>

< Review>
Stayed in a 1 bedroom, 1 den suite. Ended up being a 2 bedroom 2 bath. It was very spacious and comfortable. Since it's in the village, it's just a short walk to the trams up the mountain or to the rentals.

All day Squaw kids were great for our 4, 6, and 8 year old children. They all loved it and got a taste for skiing.

The beginner lessons for us parents were great as well. It was our first time ever and the instructors were very friendly and insightful.< /Review>

<user_name>John Robinette< /user_name><text>I thought Squaw was great in the summer but it's even better in the winter. It helped that we had over two feet of fresh snow while we were there, but even without that it was a perfect trip. The staff at Squaw Kids, ski rentals, lift ticket windows and ski lifts were all really friendly and helpful and everything you need is a short walk away through the village. Squaw for Christmas is my new favorite vacation.<//text>< rate>

Great place for the whole family. Kids loved it, lots of activities for them. Great restaurants and shopping. Game rooms for kids, small theater room you can bring your own movies in and watch on a big screen. Hot tubs in the Snow! Fun all around.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Amazing resort, great trails for all levels (even beginners will find lots of fun) and also plenty of intermediate and advanced ones. The infrastructure is awesome, with lots of lodging options and restaurants. I strongly recommend. Plan to stay 4 days and save purchasing the 'tahoe super 4' pack, much cheaper than the day pass. Renting equipment is more expensive at the resort than on the sorrounding areas, so O recommend Dave's place...good equipment at good price. Loved it!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe3US4B2fHby-bwCgud_41EQgfsG7jQ84twl7L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ9bF4znomNQKlykOwX5eS6_VSDvZT_wU68DGj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1551883054319, 'text': "Hi Juliana,\nWe're glad you loved your time at our legendary mountain!

I really like this resort, one of the biggest mountain in Tahoe area. Many options for both beginners and experienced skiers or snowboarders
A lot of restaurants and coffee shops including Starbucks at the top of the mountain<//review>

I used to not like Squaw as it seems either for  beginners or experts and not much middle. It does take some getting used to finding your way around I've now found great terrain and grooming. Still like Alpine better as it's friendlier but now you can ski both on the same pass.< /Text>

Thankfully I ended up going on a good year. The season in 2017 has been helped significantly by the end of a drought and a lead into significant snow. I met a local who had lived in the area while skiing and he said that it was possibly the best conditions it had been in over 20 years. Two issues come with that. Firstly, I caught a ski bus from San Francisco (NAC) at 4am, which arrived at Truckee at 9am but took a further 2 1/2 hours to reach the resort and another 30 minutes to start skiing. It doesn't help this is the first time skiing in the US, and that comparisons can only be made with Japan (which had world leading transport infrastructure - this type of delay would be unheard of), and Sydney, Australia which still has resorts twice the distance this is from San Francisco, yet I would still have reached the resort earlier. Anyone else coming all this way should stay at the resort. Even Truckee would be a stretch. This early in the morning, all the cars were being turned around. That said, it was a public holiday weekend and possibly expected.
Once skiing though, all was forgiven. The conditions were superb, and lines although long, progressed quickly due to many of the chairs being either high speed or high in seat number. There were a lot of places where I could take in the slopes without anyone else around.
The price though..... you have to be kidding. Another unfortunate result of being able to compare with Japan is that the price of my lift ticket at Squaw would have paid for four days of skiing in Japan, including accomodation, food and hiring of all gear and equipment - with double the annual snowfall. Regardless - still worth of a decent amount of stars. I'll be back!<//text>

Great views and a fun tram ride up to High Camp. Full of history as well, as this resort hosted the 1960 Olympics.</review>

<Review>Well, snowboarding is always fun so four stars but I did honestly expect longer runs for somewhere so highly celebrated. This is my first time there when it hasn't been storming and the lifts are actually open though so I haven't seen too much of the mountain yet. Likewise, not much snow this season, not yet, so nothing black was open to ride and powder wasn't an option. As always, I recommend mid-week for shorter lines at the lifts.
Went to the board shop for a stomp pad and they were super helpful and put the pad on for me with the heat gun and everything. Good pricing for what I expect to see at any resort let alone one of this much attraction.
I didn't hit the Irish pub this trip but I highly recommend dropping in for your drink of choice and their loaded tots: awesome, delicious, warm, comfort food perfect for any cold day.
During the summer I hike up there too and it's got plenty o good trails for that and running of course, given it's the start point for the Western States 100, or mountain biking.
The pool there is also a good spot to hang on an off-day from the dirt. The food at the cafe there is pretty good, you can get drinks, and the pool itself is a good layout for chillin out.
If you haven't been yet I also recommend checking out the Olympic museum there; pretty cool stuff in there.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFU7CtG5Ej3Oicvi0g3oXZAwu-BCKmk0jM90qr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk2P8Rg5W77tOfMb3dv8W7xxj2CG40icYQP_AB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoalkHXjIhM7SdAa0te1YHcJgcJtOuFrA6qe3x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Squaw Valley is my favorite playground as a local resident but it is also my fav as a wedding and even portrait photographer. So many backgrounds to choose from and Squaw offers A+ service for planning and venues. You can choose High Camp , the decks, OVL...  all this with village lodging. Worth a visit for sure:)< /text>

<response>None<//response><review>Loved it, the town is awesome and even though I went during summer and covid times, it is fun to visit, lots of free air, lots of space to distance yourself and just to wake up to lovely weather is awesome. Service was good, only exception is the drain from the shower was clogged, took for ever to drain the water, but the hospitality is great over all, willing to give a second chance? Yes, the cancelation takes about 14 business days to see the money back, that was another negative I noticed, staff is very helpful and understanding. It is not their fault about refund process, staff is 5/5 stars.<//review><time>1595194740022</time>< name>

<Review>What's not to love? This is a huge ski area with plenty of terrain for all skill levels, accessible by a wide variety of lifts from funiculi and aerial tram (which allow descents as well so beginners aren't forced to ski beyond their limits to the base) as well as traditional chairs. Most every one of the staff members were friendly and helpful. There is a mountaintop pool and hot tub (for an added fee) and many other amenities around the village. There is a family of chubby marmots roaming among the peaks for your viewing pleasure. And it's gorgeous.< /Review></record>

<text>Great mountain with one of the best terrain in Tahoe. Plenty to keep busy a skier or snowboarder if any level. Beginner area is mid mountain so even beginners can  get "high". Free parking can get tight on weekends so get there early. Paid parking is free with 3+ people in the car. Facilities are good but food is expensive.</text>< Pictures>

Great spot for skiing/boarding. Downsides are the many traverses and flat areas, and massive crowds. Still definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.</review>

Great spot, huge mountain with good food options in the lodge. We liked the team that took you up in a covered seated team for a 3 mile downhill run. This was the only way to handle the cold rainy day on the mountain New Years Day<//Review>

This is one of my favorite resorts in Tahoe. They have a ton of variety in their runs and it's a big resort so I can come multiple days in a row and not do the same runs over and over. If you haven't tried the cookies it's definitely a must for the end of a long snow day!<//Text>

The Tuesday Bluesday Concert at Squaw Valley Resort, has become a summer tradition for us! The crowd and music are amazing and the location is steller! If you ever have the chance to visit the Reno Tahoe area in the summer, I highly recommend you book one of the Bluesday room specials in the village, ($99 for a 1 bedroom, full kitchen condo unit!), bring some hiking shoes and bikes, along with your favorite snacks and beverages, and turn it into a 2 day mountain escape! You will not regret it!🎶< /Text>

<Review>This review is on the tubing. I should say Disco Neon Tubing which cost about $50/hr and much be prescheduled.

It’s a lot of fun, you may think it’s childish but it’s not.

<text>The best ski resort in the Sierra's. I also worked at the other end of the lake. The area was a great ski area, but our customers drove me back to Vermont. Squaw Valley USA does rock!! Your customers are way better and the terrain is awesome! This is coming from a guy who grew up a  Vermont skier. Keep up your great Squaw vibe and run it the way it is supposed to be. Go Squaw and keep keeping it real!!!</text>< user_name>

There is so much terrain that despite the large number of people that come to squaw, the slopes never feel crowded and lift lines are fairly quick.

<Review>Been coming here for years. My favorite place in Tahoe and in the American West. So glad this resort hasn't gone corporate ugly in the way other places have. It's friendlier, fun, varietal, and there is never a day where the beauty on the mountain isn't absolutely exquisite.< /Review>< Pics>

Terrain options are impressive, snow can be outstanding but can also be absolutely garbage with only 3 chairs open and they'll still charge $165.  Be prepared to pay out the nose to enjoy the beautiful scenery from the hour long lift line waits. But in all honesty it is a phenomenal experience absolutely worth it but make sure you explore every single discount available to make even more worth it.</Review>

We are a family of 3 (includes a toddler). We don't ski/snow-board but love to be around snow. This place is ideal for someone like us. Great eating places, the ride to the highland is worth it even if you are not skiing. Good idea to out your name down at the pizza place so that you  explore and come back to a ready table. We almost missed the huge food court at the back, incase you want that kind of a meal.< /Review>

Nice views, lots of runs, but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. The beginner area was pretty hard packed and windy, which can be intimidating if you're trying to learn.< /review>

Your recommendations regarding visiting Truckee or Tahoe City as part of a trip are great. As far as parking goes, we have also introduced or contributed to a number of traffic-reducing and parking initiatives such as a free shuttle service, free regional buses, carpool parking, an increased number of parking spaces, a park and ride in both Truckee and Tahoe City, better snow removal equipment, and a better guided directional flow in our parking lots. This is an important issue to us, and we will continue to improve upon it wherever possible. We appreciate that you recommended Alpine Meadows as well, which is one of Lake Tahoe's best-kept secrets. Thank you for giving practical advice to our future guests! - Liz W"}< /resp><Date>1581571140104</Date><review>Squaw valley offers arguably the best skiing in the state of California. Situated in north Lake Tahoe, Squaw stands apart from other local mountains by offering significantly larger acreage, high capacity/high speed chairlifts, typical ski-resort amenities and a variety of events & extracurriculars. Because squaw caters to both local skiers and destination/travel skiers you can expect long lift lines and large crowds at lunch spots and apres. Like many mountains in North America parking and traffic (in & out) of Squaw valley is a bummer. Especially the traffic. Plan your day accordingly and do yourself a favor and stop for a drink or browse the various shops; leaving at 4pm to go to truckee or Tahoe city could easily mean an 1hr+ drive. Squaw offers a lot of varied terrain that will almost certainly satisfy most people. Personally, I’m a much bigger a fan of alpine meadows (also owned by squaw) but most of my friends would favor Squaw. I will say squaw does seem a little dangerous at times and could use a bit more roping-off and signage for rocks, cliffs, obstructions, etc. This shouldn’t be too much of a worry since Skiing by definition is a dangerous sport. Lastly, the snow in California is and always will be California snow. Do not expect Rocky Mountain conditions. Obviously some years will be better than others but more often than not, snow isn’t great. 2018-19 season did happen to be one of the best I’ve seen in a long time so pray to the snow gods they will give us a repeat.</review><Rating>4< /Rating></record>

< review>
This place was highly recommended by friends and the history here made this an attractive resort to visit. The day (a Monday) we arrived it was very easy to rent demo equipment, get tickets and take the gondola up. I did pre-purchase my ticket and rental online which made the process easier. However, I will say the website could use some small improvements for online purchasing. It was **VERY** windy that day, all the peak lifts on the West side were closed, sadly. The mountain was otherwise wide open from the gondola and to the East, and lines were pretty much non-existent. It would have been a great day to bring kids to practice.

However, what made this awesome was the great customer service. Staff were nice while we were there but more importantly, they also were kind to us after we left. Idiotically, I left my helmet, goggles, and goPro attached at the demo shop's bench. I didn't realize this until I was driving past Sacramento toward the bay to fly out the next day. I didn't catch the resort operator before they closed so rang them in the morning frantically. Lost and found didn't have it (my heart dropped), but luckily I reached the demo shop person, Mo, remembered me and helped me out. She then brought it over to the shipping department where Anthony shipped my gear to back to me on the East coast. A couple days later it showed up. I did pay for shipping getting my helmet back but that is inconsequential to getting my helmet that has been with me for over a decade and the gopro footage/memories was priceless.

To Mo and Anthony, MANY MANY THANKS! I'm definitely repping Squaw Valley on my helmet!<//review>

I came here this winter and last winter, and it's alright! The slopes aren't too varied and the snow quality wasn't super great, but the runs are quite wide. The runs aren't too long though, and the lines are quite long. Thankfully, there are single lines though so that makes waiting a bit shorter. The parking lot is huge, and the gondola is quite good.</review>

The gondola takes you up to Ernst Stavro Blofeld's lodge.  Try the Jacuzzi!  Bring your Vivitar Wide  & Sim camera.<//Review>

<review>Great place to go with a lot of good runs. Lift tickets are $170 for one day for adults, so it's best to find a friend with an Ikon pass to get you a discount, which brings it to about $128 for a one day pass. The sometimes have fireworks at night and live music. Fun town with a bunch of places to eat or grab a drink.</review>< Pictures>

The lift tickets are expensive, but there is so much great terrain at every level. You could ski KT-22 and the Headwall all day. Check the lift status before you head to the mountain. On a great day, be prepared to wait in lift lines in the morning. The food and post-ski options are average - we had very dry sandwiches and waited a long time for beer. My mom has had a bad experience with the ski patrol people here, so look out for your own!</Review>

<Text>Great place for a afternoon walk. However, during summer it can be a bit quiet and the stores are more targeted towards skiing supplies. So, if you are looking for a place to shop for other things, this is not the place for you. However, the history of the place and architectures are very well maintained, and is worth appreciating.< /Text>< Pics>

The resort/ village is awesome and beautiful! The best skiing is definitely upper mountain but lower mountain is very good too. The powder is magic! I feel there is a good mix of black turn blue trails. Then of coarse there are pure adrenaline runs and easy sliders. When everything is running lines are minimal to perfect. The weather is a tricky balance when planning a trip. High winds, avalanche control, or initial rain turn snow can snuff out a couple days. Overall we have been lucky to catch at least 2-3 good skiing days out of 4-5 day stays we have had in our three trips here (Dec '16, Mar '18, Feb '19). I was able to get refunded as an out of stater instead of a snow check. Staff is great! I know it is a little pricey but as an east coast dweller the experience is worth the splurge.</Review>

Though the daily ticket prices are a bit extreme this resort is well ran with quite a few runs. I went early in the season and they already had 4 different runs open. Great resort would go again.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Squaw Valley is the biggest mountain around Lake Tahoe.  It is pretty far driving from South Lake (over 1 hour) but not a bad drive from Incline, Truckee, or Reno. It's gorgeous in the winter and summer. On Memorial Day annually they host a Made-in-Tahoe event with local artisans, food vendors, and live music...easily my favorite event of the year. Stunning backdrop of alpine meadows and the dramatic cliffs of squaw valley ski resort. Truly beautiful year round at Squaw Valley resort.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2ioMXmXrrGuLV8dRPpgfAZHG_eo1eDFWZjF5R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Beautiful getaway summer or winter. Many restaurants and shops. Ski lifts for in and out. Lots of hiking options and close to Lake Tahoe and Truckee for even more options. The area has a European ski village atmosphere. Recommend.< /Text>

If you're skiing with friends you can download their app which even helps you find your friends on the hill while you ride. Also, if you hit up the hill on weekdays, the lines are really short or at least move very quickly, so you can get a lot of riding in.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Best resort in the Lake Tahoe area, hands down. Best beginner area, best double-black terrain and best infrastructure (lifts, village, etc.) Even though it's more expensive than every other resort, you get what you pay for. With more than 4,000 skiable acres, you can spend an entire winter here and not ride every run. This place caters to everyone...but, actually, don't go here because it's already too packed.

We came up on November 20th and were surprised to find no crowds and 3+ feet of relatively fresh snow up at High Camp. Was a perfect time to bring beginners up the hill to practice turns before the holiday season begins and floods of people come up from the city and dump off their rude, entitled punk children on the beginner slopes who tend to ruin the experience for others.< /review>< pictures>

Great location easy to access with a fantastic drive from Alpine Meadows with Creek by the side. Lots of photo ops. Ski slopes easy access from a centralized station leading up to the Olympic village with coffee shops, bites and clothes< /review>

<Review>Came by in June so I wasn't going skiing but wanted to check the place out to see if it would be worth the trip when I want to go to a place to ski.  It definitely would be.  Besides the awesome skiing it would be there was a lot of nice shops and places to eat.  Lots of room to lodge as well.  I'm already starting to plan my next ski trip.< /Review>< user_name>

Great resort but I really don't thing the management were prepared for the weather and crowds.  Online information was not being updated or was wrong, shuttle services were running at a fraction of the posted times, and several ski runs were closed even though many people were skiing them quite safely.  Too early to tell.<//review>

<text>Room was nice, good size and bed was comfortable... Location is great... Right next to lifts if you're sking. Staff was friendly. Could use more to the fitness area and hot tub are was not impressive, but it was snowing so,  but if you're in the building and not outside in the snow or nature... You went to squaw valley for the wrong reason. All in all had a awesome stay.<//text>< pics>

Great slopes with nice amenities, polite and helpful staff, and the App makes the experience:  download the App with friends and track your ski/snowboard runs, find your friends, enjoy you day with a map on your mobile!

Visited in the Summer. The Village has it all for you, from activities to rental shops to restaurants. The tram ride is a must. Consider the adventure package if it you have the time, nothing beats a good time relaxing in the pool right? We how about the same but at the top of the mountain!< /review>

Resort has a nice vibe with plenty of bars and restaurants to choose. Some rooms have good views of the slopes, some don't. Overall, it's what you'd expect for a ski resort. Our condo was comfortable but the most basic inexpensive (think dorm quality) appliances and old furniture don't impress.<//review>

Great resort overall. But I found myself stuck in a few concave grounds while snowboarding to unfamiliar slopes. My gf was a beginner and she got stuck very often. To her, this place was much worse than mammoth.

The resort overall could be much better labeled. It was easy to get lost on the slopes without constantly looking at your map.<//review>

<review>Stunning natural beauty and the best customer service make Squaw Valley a place you'll want to return to again and again and again. Everyone, from the ticketing staff, the ski rental/demo staff, the lift operators and the ski patrol have been exceedingly friendly and genuinely helpful. We truly feel welcome every time we come to Squaw Valley Resort. This is the happiest place on Earth, not that other place in southern California.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Expensive ski resort, but the mountain is world class. I was not a particularly skilled snowboarder the first time I came here, but because the mountain is so large there is truly something for everyone. Just be sure that you know the potential routes for each lift before you head up the mountain, so you don't get in over your head. Have fun -- Squaw is a place where you can learn a lot and explore like crazy!</review>

We are here in mid June. So no skiing although it is still possible with all the snow this year. There are a number of different activities and the most obvious is golf. The room is very comfortable and we are in a suite with a kitchenette. There's 3 on site restaurants and a free shuttle will take you to town for other choices. One tip is not to open your windows because of mestiquos. Use the ac.<//Review>

Tram to High Camp provides a gorgeous view. I expect nobody goes up there for the food, but if you take the kids to the pool they're going to get hungry. Words to the wise ... It's a rip-off. Eat before you go.< /text>

This is our second time visiting.  Got to see the 27th annual Cushing's Crossing and it was a blast... Crazy busy with crowds but totally worth it! Check out the views from high camp! 👍</text>

Up until the 2019/2020 season, I was using the Epic pass so I could ski Northstar, Heavenly, and Kirkwood. I tried an IKON pass this season (so I could have a trip to Mammoth), and I was a little worried about having only one mountain to ski in Tahoe on the IKON pass: Squaw Valley. Even though this season was shortened due to Covid19, I was completly blown away by how amazing Squaw Valley was a ski destination.

Firstly, the chairlifts are amazing. The iconic KT-22 chair is a high-speed quad, making lines during midday nonexistant (unless there was a huge powder dump). However, the chairlifts only get better. Headwall Express and Siberia Express, the two chairs that go to the top of the mountain with advanced terrain, are both 6-seaters. In addition, Intermediate chairlifts Gold Coast Express, Shirley Express, and Far East Express are all 6-seaters too! The Beginners won’t be dissapointed either, as beginner lift Big Blue (False advertising?) is also a 6-seater! All in all, we get:

-6 express 6-seater lifts
-2 express 4-seater lifts
-9 slow chairlifts that run daily
-4 slow chairlifts that run rarely

Secondly, the advanced terrain is going to be a lot better than other areas. Like falling down chutes and being watched from several chairlifts? The Palisades are for you. Don’t like crowds? Head over to Granite Chief chair or the Silverado ski territory. Want to see the US’ best chairlift and lift-served ski terrain? Head on over to KT-22 Express - it’s up there with chair 23 at Mammoth for interesting chair rides. If you go up KT-22 Express and you get scared, take a right at the top, and take Saddle, the easiest way down (called a double blue, but it’s not that hard). For those who want to spend a whole day at KT-22, Saddle Face, Olympic Lady, and Schimmelpfenning Bowl are great trails to warm up on. G.S. Bowl is also a great run, although be careful, as it’s a long way to the bottom if you fall.

Sadly, there's a character limit, so I can't get into detail on Intermediate/Beginner terrain, but it exists, is good, and is serviced with high-speed 6-seater chairlifts!

And the ski mountain is going to expand too! A California Express Gondola has been approved, and it will link Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and (based on the blueprint) the backside of KT-22 (a.k.a. Troy Caldwell’s white wolf mountain) into one single ski resort! This Gondola will have 4 stations: Bottom of Squaw Valley, Top of KT-22, Bottom of KT-22 backside (the most odd and interesting one), Bottom of Alpine Meadows. I can’t wait for this gondola to be built in the future, as this plan has been going for quite some time. If you take the KT-22 chairlift to the top and go straight, you will see an unfinished KT-backside chairlift that just needs a cable and chairs on it to run. I’m confident that this chair will start running once the Gondola is built and functioning, and that this new territory will be opened up for everyone. However, this will remove the Red Dog chairlift, which will disrupt the whole East side of Squaw, as only Squaw Creek would get to the peak of Snow King, as Far East Express doesn’t go the full height. Given that the owner is replying to some of the reviews, I would like to know what’s going to happen after the California Gondola is installed, and Red Dog is removed. Will there be a Platter lift from the top of Far East Express to the top of Snow King? Will Red Dog’s base terminal simply be put higher up the mountain? Will the backside of KT-22 open up? Will the Olympic lady chair become obsolete, and be removed (it doesn’t run much already)? If the Olympic lady chair is removed, will it be relocated to Alpine Meadows or the backside of KT-22? No matter what happens, it looks like the iconic KT-22 chair will remain open, which I think we can all agree that it is more important than the Snow King area.

And that’s all I have to say about Squaw Valley!</review>

This is so weird to see following sign when people pay so many money for ski passes. Please be aware that if something happens with you because they don’t want to do their job then it’ll be only your problem.</review>

We loved Squaw Valley! My husband and I went here on our anniversary during the off season. The place was quaint (in a good way!) and the studio provided more than enough room for the two of us.

They have multiple hot tubs, rec room/clubhouse with foosball, a large table to eat at, multiple fire places, and a sauna. Close to hiking and nice to walk around Olympic Village and the shopping center there.<//text>

There are a few things I'm not tremendously fond of with Squaw, first is the crowds, second is the lack of trees on the ski terrain, and third is how quick they are to close the ski lifts on stormy days. There's a lot that I like, such as Squaw is amazing when you catch an event or day of skiing that's not too busy. I have been fortunate to be able to attend events on days that attract smaller crowds and I have always had such a lovely time. The resort is beautiful with great food options. The pool is super awesome. The terrain is fun to ski/ride. There's something for everyone.</review>

Squaw is huge, with a large number of trails. A great place to snowboard! Talk to the information people, near the tram, and they will discuss which trails are best for your skill level and interests.</Text>

This resort offers pretty good skiing and the views are amazing, However:
1) Even though the weather was really good today (apart from a little wind) they decided to close a part of the mountain which meant a lot of lines to the chairlifts and busy slopes. Which caused quite a few accidents.
2) They also closed a couple of runs to prepare for a ski competition a week ahead. In a couple of places they left narrow steep passage, along with the ice this felt pretty dangerous. And indeed someone eventually broke their collar bone because they ran into another person.
3) Ski pass is ridiculously expensive. And also the food. $12 for a bowl of chili? $13 for a chicken sandwich?
4) none of the chairlifts had a bar to put your skis/snowboard on so they had to hang in the air.
5) The entrance to almost all the chairlifts is downhill, so with the ice today people ended up sliding into the person in front.
6) When you get out of the chairlift you need to walk uphill before you can slide down. Who designed this?<//text>

Tickets was probably the most pleasant experience to begin with that I could've asked for. The lift operators and guest services are all individually helpful above any expectation I could've set. Terrain: out of this world. It snowed and snowed and there could've have been enough fresh lines and new terrain to hit. I'm glad I'm an experienced rider because I was pushed to the limits. Thank you for the best guest experience!< /Review>

TUBING SUCKED!  They won't let you go tandem with another, jump on the tube, go on your stomach, or have fun at all!  Even though you signed an insurance waiver that no matter what happens I you won't hold them responsible. So I tube at my own risk. Shouldn't that grant me the right to tube the way I want?< /Text>

<Review>Great place, but it gets busy, especially in the winter with people skiing. Here’s what you can do while you’re here.

On the ground:
Take a peek into the window of the building housing the gondolas. It’s fun to watch.

If you go down to the restrooms below the building housing the trams, remember to go over to the window. You can see what makes the trams go.

Go to the restaurants and shops

Sometimes, you can do the rock climbing, mini golf, and the slack line thing between some trees. When they aren’t going, be sure to check out the lifts on the ground that take people up to ski. It’s fun to sit on them when they aren’t moving.  Also, they have bungee jumping sometimes.

Up on the mountain where the tram takes you:

Skating

Swimming

Hiking around

Skiing (I believe)

Be sure to check out Squaw Valley! It’s a lot of fun.< /Review>< Pictures>

Could be better. Conditions were amazing for late spring skiing but ( from what I'm guessing is ) a business decision to close an entire side of the mountain by shutting off a bunch of lifts. Can't blame them though because traffic was light. Alternately, light traffic meant more mountain to ourselves. ;)</review>

Even if it's late in the season, the resort still has lots of fantastic trails. The trails are fantastic. There are enough trails for all skill levels. As a novice snowboarder, your skill level will definitely shoot up when you ride here. I highly recommend exploring the other side of the mountain.

The aioli bar is a great treat.< /review>

Some great terrain! It's in general steeper than many other mountains and has more rocks / cliffs to contend with. This last trip was the best with fresh, more than 1.5' of powder to play in!< /Text>

Our goal with POW Parking is to encourage our guests to carpool to help reduce our carbon footprint and combat the traffic congestion issues we deal with daily in the Tahoe area. The paid parking option was available earlier this season to allow vehicles with fewer than 3 people to park in that carpool lot, but we eliminated the paid option earlier this season and reverted the lot back to carpool-only parking.\nThanks for asking! :-) We hope to see you again next season in one of our free or carpool lots!\nCheers,\nAnne\n\nOriginal response on 4/17:\nDear Mike,\nThank you for visiting Squaw Valley and for taking the time to leave a review.

Huge area. Some fast lifts over good variety of terrain. But not cheap. Especially if too full so you have to use the obnoxious pay lot:(.

Great resort, if you carry 3+ you are eligible for free parking, right next to the tram. Squaw even has golf carts zooming between the parking lot and tram entrance, very convenient.
The upper mountain terrain can be windy as it is very exposed, especially during storms, if it is not raining at the base go there.</Review>

Love that place! Nice shops, restaurants, fire pits. Beautiful mountain view and lift that takes you up to the mountains even in summer time to Olympic Valley. A bit too pricey though for a lift itself during non skiing season which is  $23 or so..< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Beautiful resort, host to the olympics in the day. Tons of terrain to shread. Families take the Funitel to the Gold Coast base where most of the beginner terrain and a good deal of intermediate terrain sit in a beautiful bowl area with access to about 6 lifts that will entertain most all day long. High camp has food and Gold Coast along with exterior seating weather permiting. Now for the more advanced head up top on  siberia or headwall for lots of open face bowls or on backside toward granite chief for some trees and steeps. Also at the base you can hit kt22 or red dog for an  additonal load of advanced terrain. This mountain offers lots of fun for all levels, friends and family alike. Certainly lessons from noob to advanced available for riding and skiing. Weekends can be very crowded, mid week if able, rocks. Have a blast and winter it up.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Not what it used to be. It used to be an iconic resort with unbelievable terrain and a wonderful ski culture. Now it is nothing more than a holding on the books of an investment company. They don't care about skiing and they could care less about the customer experience.

I'm sure someone in the marketing department will reply to this review and say how much they care about their customers, but I can assure you they don't operate the mountain as if they do. These days they spend way more time marketing the mountain and making sure it is constantly packed (which it is) than they do making an effort to operate the mountain and open terrain. 2,3,4 days after a storm they still struggle to get areas of the mountain open and they make excuses and whine on social media like there's no tomorrow. If it snows, they shut down. If it's windy, they shut down. I can probably count on one hand the amount of days that all the lifts have been running on the same day this season. The bottom line is that they either have no idea how to run a ski area or they just don't bother to do it because it isn't profitable enough for them.

If I were ranking the mountain on the terrain, it would be a 5, the mountain is awesome. Unfortunately the people running it bring it down to 2/5 stars. It really is sad, I love Squaw with all my heart. I wish they could pull it together and run as smoothly as they did when Alex Cushing owned it.< /text>

<Review>The resort itself was pretty, but the cost was wayyy too much for a day ticket bought day-of at the resort. The price was about $180 for just the ski ticket for a single day, plus another $50 for the ski, boot, and pole rental.

The quality of the rentals was excellent. The process for getting them was great too.

I ended up getting a two hour pass, from 2-4pm, for $80, which was already a lot of money. That is the price of a day ticket at other resorts. All in all, not worth the price.</Review><gmap_id>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f</gmap_id><name>Alex Krentsel< /name>< user_id>

I've been here a few times now, and the resort and staff are great, but there's never any snow in Tahoe, so I would give the whole lake a one or 0 for skiing.  Can't fault Squaw for Mother Nature, but you'd never believe they actually held a WINTER Olympics there!</Review>

Went into the shopping area to grab some gluten free pizza , which was great. They let you take your dog which is always a plus ! Only draw back was a bunch of dogs off leash peeing on the parked skis and making it hard for my dog who is in training and on leash. Cute area -needs a few rules for clueless dog owners-< /Review>

It's a great resort, never really gets crowded on the slopes even on extremely crowded days but it's a bit too expensive. Plenty of shops and restaurants and things to do.< /Text>

< Review>
The mountain looked beautiful and been planning on coming with a couple of friends for a while, because we heard good reviews about Squaw valley. Called the same day to ask if they had any military deals, and they said they did and we would be able to get it. After a 3 hour drive, we get there and they failed to mention one critical piece of information. That it doesn't work on holidays. So after the whole drive we had to pack our stuff and leave, we didn't have enough time to go to another mountain, so the whole day was wasted. Disappointing, and I'm not blaming the front desk lady for turning us down, because that's the rules, just hope for the next people that call Squaw valley resort, they will mention that one little but very important information.</Review>

Good-looking resort. The people here were extremely helpful. My mom got stuck near a cliff area, and the ski patrol quickly acted when I told them the problem. They even took pictures of my mom for her. Quick, extremely helpful ski patrol really made my trip as awesome as the amazing skiing and weather</text>

Great place. The mountain was pretty cool. I came because I have the ikon pass and squaw falls under it. The runs were pretty cool but the biggest problem I had was that people (not the people that worked there) were really really rude! They have signs everywhere to stay "15 feet in distance" from each other, but it was far from it. I was nearly run over several times.

Its not too far away from san Francisco, just 3 hours drive. This is really my favorite place for ski.

I have been waiting many years to go on a tram... especially this one I was not let down The guides were great and capable of answering all my questions The ride was very smooth and the view was spectacular Too bad I was not here when the weather was a little warmer Would have loved to soak in the hot tub.
These guys are awesome. They worked with me and my family well. We were able to get great service quickly so we could get on our way to a great day of skiing.
Convenient location, great selection and the best prices in  Lake Tahoe. WOW I strongly recommend this great place in CA</review>

What a great little resort. They throw some cool parties and events here, and their lines aren't that long at all. During the spring and summer they have some cool things going on too. Make sure you check out some things in Truckee because they will send you here to have a fun day of drinking and maybe some sunny skiing/boarding.</Text>

< Review>
I didn't get a normal experience at Squaw, but I can say that their safety and ski patrol is very solid. In a
related topic, many of my friends regard Squaw to be amongst the best of resorts for good slopes.

I've attached a picture of myself getting tobogganed down a hill after my fall, which unfortunately cost me an ACL tear.

Finding that I was unable to walk after a fall, I flagged down a ski instructor, who called for ski patrol. Within 5 minutes, an officer of ski patrol came down to access what had happened and had another member bring the sled within the 5.

They were very professional and well mannered about my injury. Big shout out to Sarah and her father for shuttling me down! I made a bad mistake, but they helped me make the best of it.</Review>

Snow board lessons were excellent. Our instructor was hilarious and explained everything clearly. Good selection of shops which was convenient since we forgot a few things. The resort was beautiful as well.< /text>

Squaw valley is such a beautiful place both in summer and winter. I really enjoy this place, they have nice caring and loving staff so that's a must that they accomplish. They have decent hotel rooms. I love how there's a little shopping square within the village as with food and the bars. So that way you don't have to go anywhere else besides just in the village with all that provided. My opinion probably the best place to ski and snowboard🙂< /review>

Cool place and a lot of snow. But that doesn't keep up with way to many people on the mountine and a way to expensive lift ticket. Slow lifts compare to the alps. A powder day is tracked out in 2 hours! Even if you buy a ticket in advance it's not worth the ticket price.
Compare with St Anton, Grinderwald, Åre, Niseko, Riksgränden. Cool place Lake Tahoe. It's worth a visit for the nature. Would go back to the Lake Tahoe for some hiking.< /review>

<Review>It was very quiet at Squaw Valley when we visited. It was not the height of ski season and it was not the middle of summer. Early October was a fantastic time to explore Squaw Valley and the magnificent surrounding area. We loved it. And we would return in an instant. So much to do. So much to see.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Went on one of the best snow days of the year with the whole family.  After spending about $900 on lift tickets and ski rentals, got to top of first run and Squaw shuts down 99% of the lifts claiming too windy.

It was a little windy, but after an hour it was blue skies and they still kept all lifts closed except for one or two and lift lines were 45 minutes.  A friend called me from top of a run he hiked up to (because lifts were closed) and said it wasn't windy at all.  They kept only 2 lifts open the rest of the day and the crowds/lines were unbearable.

The previous day we didn't go because we watched the online lift reports and saw the same thing happened.  It was windy that day, but not bad.  The day we went it was nice but still they kept lifts closed.

No refunds were given either day.  After spending $500 for cabin, $900 for skis, and gas to drive up I won't be going back there again.

I've been told by long time Squaw locals that the management isn't running their finances well and that this was likely a cost cutting attempt to avoid having to pay lift ops and electricity.  They won't be renewing their season  passes next year.< /Review>

Variable challenging terrain with many hi- speed lifts. Incredible ski racing heritage.
Spring skiing the best in America's second to Mammoth. Vast terrain for all types of skiers. Lots of steep terrain. This area is subject to lift closures from high winds.< /text>

Absolutely the nicest employees and the public areas of the resort were lovely.  All of us totally enjoyed ourselves.  We will return!  Our suite wasn't ready on time but we weren't upset.  Still we were treated as though it was an egregious error.  We accepted the apologies but still the resort tried to make it up to us. (How nice!) Wow!  Two flaws:. 1) Rude bellhop who wanted a larger tip (my sons were happy to take our luggage up but not allowed) and 2) suite needed to be refreshed.  The decor was early 80's with a number of stains and holes in fabric plus the "kitchen" didn't have an oven or freezer.< /review>

Normal pricing for a single day lift ticket is $180.  This is crazy. Yes, you can buy a season pass or find discounted tickets ahead of time but if you live locally/NorCal and just want to ski for a day you need to be either rich or sell an organ. This sadly has become the reality for many California ski resorts.
When you walk into the rental shop they don’t even have prices posted, they just assume people bend over and whip out a credit card. The good old days where everyone could afford to ski with their family are over.<//text>

Only reason it's not 5 stars is because two hot dogs with chili on them is $28. Ridiculously expensive to eat, but that's expected I guess. Other than that, wonderful ski resort. Beautiful. Nice new buildings. Rentals are high quality. Friendly staff. And it would take days to ski every run.</review>

{'time': 1549909544359, 'text': "Hi Joyanne, You're right: much of Squaw Valley's beginner terrain is located at the top of the mountain off of the Tram. That means that we can offer beginner skiers stunning views of Lake Tahoe while they are learning a new sport. Mountain Run, the three-mile blue run that goes down to the base, is a good goal for skiers and riders as they progress to intermediate levels and beyond. Alpine Meadows offers beginner terrain at the base of the mountain and is also a great place for new skiers and riders to learn. Thank you for your review. We hope to see you on the slopes again soon!"}</Response>
<GmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f</GmapID><Review>A bit pricey, but really huge and amazing ski resort. One thing, though, if you don't know a bit of skiing already, this may not be the best place to learn. All the green slopes are at the top, and there's not an easy way to get all the way down the mountain. So you need to take the lifts and tram back. I wish they would make a green route all the way down.

If you can handle blue, then it's great, and lots of more challenging runs for the experts. If it's your first time skiing, maybe learn somewhere smaller first and then come here once you're confident stopping and turning.</Review>< Rating>

What a beautiful resort!! The views from that high up were worth the distance and time it takes to get there. I was here for a Spartan race and the venue had so much to offer! Theres shopping, a coffee shop and even several restaurants. Event though the place was packed with racers there was still plenty of spaces.<//Review>

<Review>I liked how big squaw valley was and that it had 2 ski/snowboard parks (advanced and beginner). The runs of of Granite Chief and Shirley are quite fun as well. I have not explored the bottom runs of squaw yet and only use Mountain Run, Sunnyside, and Home Run to get down from the top. Some things to improve upon is a skiing or snowboarding connection between Alpine and Squaw so that you could ski or snowboard between the two since they are partners and more parking space that is not obstructed by the snow (like a closed parking building).< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Can't get any closer to the lifts than this! The lodge is a little dated, but the lower price more than makes up for that. The rooms are clean, no problems there. If you plan to ski all day and mostly sleep and eat here, it's perfect. The spa is a great way to end a long ski day.< /Review>

<review>I've both skied at Squaw and attended Wanderlust in the summer. It's stunning at both times of year. The skiing is really good and I enjoyed the vastness of the park. In the summer, I enjoyed the hiking and the high camp pool area. The gondola to high camp is fast and large.<//review>< Pictures>

Season pass holder for 2nd season in a row and what a crazy season its been! I mean we saw it all this season and Squaw didn't disappoint. One suggestion or want would be to bring back night riding with park and pipe features.< /Review>

Bought a 2017 season pass. This is the most amateur resort I've encountered. They are consistently closed or blocking mountain access. I have never been to a resort who is closed more on a weekend. Just drive the extra 8hrs to Salt Lake City and get better resorts, snow, and much cheaper than the $159 for Squaw.</text>

Squaw is a love/hate relationship. The mountain itself and its village are certainly the best in Tahoe. Squaw is truly a world class mountain. The problem is that most of the time, a majority of the mountain is closed to public. If you decide to go, understand you may not be able to ski what you want.<//text>

<text>Not as expected, runs are shorter that expected and runs could get crowded easily.

Youll be constantly looking out for people. Its interesting that they would have beginners runs in the middle of the mountain funneling everyone on the same road/runs.

Should a lift operator have the right to put there finger on you? Yeah!!! It happened and unfortunately for me I own a season pass with here.

Lift operator are very demanding and with no smile on there face... Theve forgotten that they are in existence BECAUSE OF US THE COSTUMERS.</text><user>104496876858850416686< /user>< name>

While the skiing here can be great, the early season is terrible and they offer no discounts for early season.  We paid full price for 20% of the lifts open.  Additionally, the majority of the runs during December are in the shade and completely icy.  The staff seems preoccupied with catching up with their friends and smoking weed- there are exceptions, but the majority are immature and don't treat it like a job.  All in all the worst ski experience I've had in 30 years of skiing (including Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Europe, and even back east in Massachusetts and Vermont.  I waited 2 months to post this, but after an awesome day at Bear Mountain of all places, with peaks at only 8,500, I just realized I paid twice as much for Squaw, for only half the experience.< /text>

Was here the last week in July 2015, with my wife and 13 year old daughter. We loved it!! The 1 bedroom condo was huge and clean and beautiful decorated in rustic mountain style. The kitchen was well stocked. The village area was great, a very casual and mellow atmosphere. We ate at two restaurants in the village, a Irish Pub and Fireside Pizza, both were excellent. The pizza place had live entertainment on the outside deck. We enjoyed the campfires placed around the village, and also saw a evening movie playing outdoors. Personally as the Dad on the trip, I appreciated the front desk help when asking about good places to hike and swim. The girl at the desk was patient and wrote down all the best hiking trails on a map, and her favorite beach. We did most of them, and every one was a jem! After our 4 nights stay, both my wife & daughter complimented me on choosing the Squaw Valley Resort. So, right there, a winner.

If we return to Tahoe, which is very likely as it's the most beautiful place on Earth. We will be back at Squaw Valley.<//Text>

Beautiful place, but the service at these places is no good. I was there as an athlete and was treated poorly. It's like just because I wasn't in an expensive snowsuit, I didn't matter. Those people need to remember that anyone who is staying there is the reason they get a paycheck.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Squaw Valley is one of my favorite resorts within the Tahoe/Reno area.  Within the ten years of snowboarding,  I've been to all the resorts and still find myself visiting Squaw Valley at least once every season.  There are many qualities makes Squaw outshine all the others. I'll highlight my main reasons:

1. Everyone is friendly - from the staffs at the parking lot to the staffs high above the mountain.

2. Diverse staffs - not many people will pay attention to this,  but I do as I have older parents who are actively working bc aren't ready for retirement.  I appreciate the fact that Squaw doesn't discriminate; age, gender,  race,  etc.  You can connect with any staffs there bc of it.

3. Clean - I'm not sure about the men's restrooms, but the women's are clean.  They also have complimentary feminine products.

4. Price - if you buy your ticket online early,  you'll save at least $40. We bought ours online for $129; on day of, it was $169. The online purchase do not have expiration date and you can use them individually.

Overall,  those are my main reasons for supporting and coming back to Squaw Valley besides their multiple runs for different level - beginners to experts.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Decent place, we stayed in a 2BR condo. Only problem was the AC. I know it's a winter resort, but if you're going to rent it in the summer, you need real AC. Their alternative is a very noisy portable unit in the family room that vents onto the patio (which makes that area hard to use due to the hot exhaust), with box fans to blow cool air into the bedrooms. I thought it was a joke until I called the front desk. Our room was 85 degrees when we checked in for those who think it doesn't get that hot. Resort overall is nice, great amenities, lots of dining options, super friendly staff.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Pretty great runs available. Park is vast and could take three days to explore everything. I liked the backside since they had two bowls that are really fun to go down.< /Review>

Fun place to hangout for a weekend. They do fireworks on Saturday evenings. The skiing is great, except that all the green runs are near the top. When conditions are windy, the lifts that take you up are the first to close. 😑< /text>

I wanted to surprise my daughter and her husband with something special when they arrived at resort. I contacted the Concierge Kate to make my request. I was amazed at the great information and assistance I received. I have never received such great customer service! From the moment they answered the phone until I made my request I was treated with such courtesy and kindness. Thank you so very much for helping me make my kid’s vacation just a little more special. Thank you Kate!<//text>

Squaw still ranks as my favorite general focus, all-mountain mountain in California. It's got a ton of terrain, plenty of snow, great access to fast lifts and gondolas, and a proper resort feel for apres-ski. No wonder squaw has hosted seminal moments in NA skiing history with events like the '60s Olympics and many actual olympiads. Add the growing collaboration with neighboring Alpine Meadows, and you have thousands of acres of exciting snow playground. Not to mention that Squaw keeps it's lift and season passes more affordable then the competing Northstar resort.

Squaw is a terrific experience for service and value. The kids ski school is just terrific--super supportive and patient. Everyone consistently makes us feel welcome and valued as customers, and the overall value is strong.

The company is investing heavily and creatively in development partnerships to solve parking, transit and other area problems in sustainable ways, and the management team is really knocking it out of the park in operations and communications to customers this year, despite enormous challenges from record snowfall.< /Text>

Squaw is hands down the best skiers resort in the USA. It’s still just a little rough around the edges, and yet refined. The skiing varies from the extreme, which made it famous, to the green groomers that make it a good fit for families.<//Text>

Staff is friendly and helpful. Runs are long and pleantiful. Powder is on the far right usually. Grooves are freshly created and well kept. Snow park is pretty awesome. The Olympic Museum nastalgic and the outdoor ice skating rink. Definetly a place to visit car pool if you can, or stay for the weekend the Snow Village is fresh and breath taking.<//Text>

Pretty fun but a couple members of the staff were surly. Also they prominently advertise their disc golf course but there were only two haphazardly placed baskets.</text>

After rediscovering the BayAreaSki Bus.. I started doing day trips to Squaw again. It's a nice resort, good food options, lots of runs and helpful staff.  Great place to snowboard. Especially if you are lucky enough to catch some powder off Broken Arrow.

Easy rental options and demo shops for those without their own equipment.

Expect to pay $12 for a cocktail. Roughly $12 for lunch. The lower food options are better than what you'll find in the upper mountain.

Great place for the family.< /text>

The hotel was very clean. The room was perfect. Sarah at the desk as well as all the staff just awesome. 2 complaints. Charged an additional 25 bucks for a resort fee upon checkout. Not happy. Also a bottle of water and a very small chocolate milk was 9 bucks. Pretty overpriced.
View was spectacular.< /text>

The skiing here can be phenomenal.  Variety of terrain, elevation, snow - it's all here.  The price for such extravagance is that Squaw attracts a huge crowd.  The parking lot is huge, and it fills up, spilling over onto the access road.  On my most recent visit, the lines were long even for a Sunday (7-12 minutes, which is long for this day and age) and here at Squaw, they generally leave it to the skiers to self-regulate the lines, which *most* people do.  After all these years, I am surprised they still do not have a shuttle to get people across the treacherously icy parking lot.  Know what you are getting yourself into, and you will have a great time here!< /Text>

<user>103220204310528510305<//user><review>It is in a great location close to Tahoe City. It's clean and visually pleasing. Our kids were excited about the water slide in the heated pool. I'm not sure what the actual temp of the pools were heated too, but it was still VERY cold. The kids couldn't stay in it very long. When Lake Tahoe's water is warmer than the pool, I wouldn't really consider those heated.
My biggest complaint which rendered my rating of three stars was the AC in the room. They have mattress covers on all the mattress that prevents them from breathing. We would turn our AC down as low as it would let us, and we would still wake up burning up. We called almost every day complaining. They offered to move us, but I went to that room first to see if it was any cooler and it wasn't. The hallways always felt amazing! I was tempted to pull my bed out there. We would lower the thermostat every night to the lowest it would go and when we woke up burning up it would be 4 degrees higher.
We just called down again to tell them the thermostat is changing from where we are setting it. A guy came into the room to look at it and advised us that these systems were just recently changed to new systems and the thermostats reset after 6-8 hrs. So, I told him when I wake up burning up its because the thermostat is changing 4 degrees higher. He pretty much was like yeah that's what it does. He said the old systems were worst, and it took them 5 yrs to finally get them replaced....as if this made me feel better about burning up at night. It is not worth any amount of money to me if I can not get a good nights sleep because I'm burning up!!!! Another weird design is that they have the air vent on the wall right next to the huge curtained window. Most Hotel rooms have them on the wall to where the air goes towards the beds where you actually sleep! Whoever designed this format was not feasibly thinking of sleeping in the room! We LOVE Lake Tahoe, but I'm ready to get a good nights sleep!<//review>< user_name>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Way too expensive for what it is. I really enjoyed it 10y ago when a day pass cost $65; went up 8-10 times a season. Not worth double the price though. The last few years I haven't spent a single dollar in Tahoe but prefer to go to Utah or Europe (if I have more time).</Text>< Rate>

<Text>A steeper and larger ski resort on Lake Tahoe, Squaw offers a mixture of chair, gondola, and tram access to the snow. With several harder terrain options, many prefer Squaw for it's difficulty. Others prefer the abundance of high speed chairs, moderate terrain, and village atmosphere.<//Text>< pictures>

One of our favorite Tahoe ski resorts for its diverse terrain, excellent snow grooming, and best-in-class ski patrol. For intermediate and advanced skiers, there is a wide selection of groomed and open bowl skiing, especially if you include Alpine Meadows as part of Squaw Valley. What makes it such a great experience, though, is the active presence of ski patrol ensuring skiers and snowboarders are in control and safe. Unlike places like Northstar, it's far less likely you'll be hit from behind or run over by idiots who just want to see how fast they can go before they crash.

The village is lovely and has everything you need for a day, week, or season of winter fun.<//Text>

< review>
Disappointing first time stay, we were told we would be getting a one bedroom suite, however we got a normal room which didn’t work since there were 2 couples. TV channels didn’t work most of the day. Worst part was the snow plows/heavy machinery going on all night long outside our room. We slept very little both nights due to this. Lastly and most disappointing was the fact they wouldn’t let us check out late, despite all the highways being closed and we literallly had nowhere to go. Definitely would not come back. I will say the heated underground parking is nice, and the rest of the village is great.</review>

I am out of pocket $600 because the 395 was closed and we could not get to the resort. While on our way, we had to stop in Mammoth and turn around.  We begged the resort to refund us and they would not. THey offered a "ski cheque" requiring us to go back again before this season ends.  It was a one time opportunity for us.  I will never go to Squaw nor will recommend it to anyone.  I am certain there are others out there who have experienced the same disappointment as us.</text>< Name>

I got to stay at The Village for the Spartan Race World Championships last weekend. Since it was where the race was held, we just walked downstairs from our unit to get to registration. The village is quite big with lots of shops and restaurants all within walking distance.< /review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>Used to be a great resort, now wind holds poor staffing and over sold passes have created a bay area type experience of bottle necks, traffic jams, and dangerous work environments for employees. When skiing other resorts it is the most common conversation how Squaw Valley has taken a turn for the worse.  It's a bummer, such great terrain and an amazing legacy.< /text>< Pictures>

Some of the most varied terrain around, especially since they connected with Alpine.  Granite Chief is my favorite area to ski.  Just hope the snow conditions improve. Good thing the Olympics were not held in Tahoe this year.<//text>

That place has ridiculous prices. $180/day for ski lift, $40 for 15 min kid snowmobiles in anemic setting? Give me a break. No wonder there no usual crowd on the mountain this Christmas. As i learned they changed ownership - that explains it. Keep going, sooner you go bankrupt, sooner things will change for better greedy guys.< /review>

Went out today to do some disco tubing and was let down because tickets sold out. I drove out there. It took me 1hr for this BS excuse (sold out) I even check the internet for advanced tickets. There website read first come base. If you are doing any traveling please call your destination first. Lessons learned 🤨< /review>

< review>
My husband won a package through Squaw Valley that included 1yr lease of a Toyota Highlander, new skis with boots, ski clothes and a ski pass for the two of us for the 2017/2018 ski noise. My husband tried to contact them several times and they were always going to get back to him. Needless to say we did get the Toyota for a yr and the skis but nothing else. So the next time you enter a drawing and by chance your name is drawn you may NOT get what they said you won.  So disappointed because I have never skied and was looking forward to learning. 😕</review>

Nice ski resort, was once home to the winter Olympics. Has some very challenging runs. Could use more signage. I feel like I missed a lot of stuff due to lack of information.<//Text>

<Review>Either pay $100 or so there or $97 for 12:30 time in. I highly suggest to buy it online for a slight bit more discount so your time would be more worth it.
Taking the gondolas up you will be able to start your adventures. There were tons of different lifts going to different part of the mountains. Sadly though there were some very FLAT areas which is very difficult for boarders so gotta learn to shimmy your body or if your new, just take off them bindings!

Lift tickets may cost over an arm and leg but the runs are quite long, but watch out for your last run around 4pm ...There is tons and tons of moguls so watch out for them and skiers!</Review>< Pictures>

Went in the summer (August) so we did not go to ski.  We went to go hiking.  We had a great hike through beautiful country you would never see if you just drove around the area.   If you are looking for some nice hiking you will enjoy this.< /Review>

Beware that they tend to rate the slopes less difficult than they actually are so beginners should stick to the green runs around high camp.  Literally everything here is stupendously expensive though.< /review>< pictures>

Hit a full day after the hectic monster lines on a Saturday after the first big dump of the winter. What is there bad to say about this place minus the price. If you can afford this place its gorgeous, massive, has it all from shops to lodging, eating, valet, etc. As for the mountain itself, tons of lifts (all are usually not open) and some of the best views I've ever seen in my life. Good avi control here so be sure to hit that headwall lift hard.< /text>

Good slopes, well maintained and great variety. Lift tickets and food is way too expensive. Bring your own food as you can skip a long line and waste so much time on lunch.< /review>

My initial impressions were marred because at first I thought this was a skiier's resort, and damn, there are soooo many of them. But then as I became more educated I learned Jeremy Jones is here, and during good snow years a lot of the top snowboarders train here. The only thing that makes Tahoe stand out among other places in the USA is its snowboarders, and the awesome beauty of watching their creativity when you go ride. Squaw is great, but Alpine Meadows is even better, and it suffers the usual ills that plague Tahoe ski resorts: anti-density and NIMBY car driving wealthy homeowners block any sensible construction of middle class hotels, so they lose a lot of great vibes and there's way too much time spent driving in a parking lot unless you're super wealthy. There are no hostels here, but there are no hostels on any resorts in Tahoe, and on the plus side they offer a TART bus. There's just not as good a vibe when a place is stuffed with wealthy ski families and there are no options for single or working class people. Food is standard ski food, although the village is getting better, and it would be really cool to have banh mi and poke and French cheese and delicious baguettes and Indian rotis. The swimming pool is actually pretty fun and not cheesy at all, and man! during good years it's just so fun to watch the best snowboarders ride.< /text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>I really enjoy skiing at squaw but I have two specific complaints. The first is probably just opinion but I feel like they close or put lifts on hold too easily, I always go during the week so it is probably more economical for them to do so. The second complaint is lift ticket prices, I have a pass so this isn't a problem but when I want to go with friends or family who do not it is very expensive. Even online ticket prices are significantly more than the vail resorts, arguably smaller but still. I doubt prices will ever decrease but I feel the need to voice this complaint. For evidence I payed $87 at Kirkwood this Tuesday while my brother payed $160 at squaw today, Wednesday. Squaw pass purchased online Kirkwood at the window. For accuracy I was able to get a discount for ski with a friend on rhe epic local pass but still.</Review>< pics>

The experience was tremendous. But my appreciation for the special deal you give to veterans, 25$ for a season pass, is not matched by any resort in the country. Thankyou and we will be back.....<//Review>

They had trouble keeping the lifts running. Also not the best laid out mountain that I've been on. It's hard to get around from one side to the other. Prices are pretty reasonable though.<//Review>

< review>
Here is the deal with this place.  If you can take two weeks off and stay there, you'll be golden.  If you can go on a whim and find a place to stay on short notice or just drive back at the end of the day, that would work

But, if like most people, you can manage 3-4 long weekends in a season that you need to book at least a month of more in advance, and IF there is a storm that hits when you are there, you will be in Reno pulling slots.  Here is how it breaks down:

Storm starts, too warm - raining and windy. A few lower lifts may be open, but don't count on it.
Begins to cool, starts snowing - lifts closed due to wind
Snow finally abates - lifts closed due to avalanche danger, check back at noon, then check back at 1PM.  Lifts close at 4 so basically, they don't open.

Look, I get it, skiing is a sport that DEPENDS on bad weather.  Unfortunately, this resort is unable to operate (or unwilling to) unless the conditions are PERFECT.  I also understand the corporatification of skiing and that the location of Squaw puts it into a very strong wind channel.  But, over the years, this resort has been getting more and more conservative to the point where a season pass is just not worth it any more.< /review>

<review>Overall a mediocre skiing experience. Only good during record breaking snow year due to low base altitude. Decent verical although only about 1000 ft. of its 2800 has decent snow. The overall consensus I keep hearing is " best mountain at Tahoe" . I can think of more than 25 resorts in the states that dominate the Lake Tahoe area and I have skiied them all over and over. If you like steeps and deep with great snow try Jackson Hole or any Resort in Utah or if in California try Mammoth a much better Sierra experience!<//review><Name>A S</Name><UserId.>113169117421952883245<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Sick resort with awesome riding. The resort is huge and has runs for every skill level. From mellow hills, to the steeps. Staff is nice. The lifts are pretty standard as any resort. Instead kf having a pass dangling from your pants all day, they have key cards that scan theough your gear so it can stay in your pocket all day.
It has a great village if you're not into skiing, and some great dining options.< /text>

Long time passholder at Squaw & Kirkwood.  Squaw is an amazing mountain with unbelievable terrain, a legendary culture and some of the best local skiiers and riders in the world, including winter sports pioneers such as Shane McConkey, Jeremy Jones,  the MatchStick Productions crew, more Olympians than you can shake a stick at, and many, many others.  This is also one of the best spring skiing destinations on the planet. There are, however, some downsides: 1) squaw has become oppressively expensive in all dimensions.  A season pass is absolutely required if you want to ski there more than a few days a year- ticket window prices are now >$160, and forget about having someone lean to ski there- you are in for >$300/day- not conducive to bringing friends into the sport.  2) Squaw has been hit by climate change- it is increasingly frequent for squaw to get rain on its base, and (if we're lucky) snow on top.  3) the mountain is huge, which is amazing, but also means that some favorite (but less popular) lifts run very infrequently.  4) on the weekends or powder days, expect crowds, lots of crowds.  once the whole mountain opens, people disperse, but until then, expect to put in some line time.  On the plus side, if you put up with all of the above, you get to ski or ride squaw with some of the best winter athletes on the planet, and with terrain to test you at any ability level.  A final note, people can get agressive on line on a powder day.  Don't take it personally, they want to be in the snow and don't have patience for you not having your act together in front of them.  focus on the snow and it will all be okay...  This is a place for people who deeply love to ski and ride.  enjoy!<//text>

<Name>Nikki Ahmadi<//Name><Response>None<//Response><Text>I have mixed feelings about this mountain. I found one particular run that I enjoyed the most and ended up coming back to. Some runs were closed for a race, some due to low visibility.. overall despite it being a huge mountain, it gets super crowded. It took us over 45 minutes just to pick up our lift tickets on a Friday.
Beautiful views on top.. the kind that makes you want to wait before riding down.
Like many ski resorts , great cozy downtown area<//Text><GmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f<//GmapID><Rate>4</Rate>< UserId.>

<Text>Got food poisoning from the cantina, floors were dirty, room service didn't even have a vacuum for daily cleaning, got stuck with no power and they told us roads were too bad to leave then people showed up to check in and said roads were fine. Would not comp a room or offer free night for no power.  Staff lied about not having a generator because they didn't want people to be mad because it broke down.  I have never been lied to so many times at one place.  Probably won't come back.<//Text>< username>

This golf course is truly amazing,the way it playes between the meadow the creek and the  mountain. The service is AWESOME, everyone from the Sandy's Pub to the Pro Shop, Michael Mc Ityre the starter will take care of anything that you need . He took care of the group in front of us I was so impressed with the way he keep everything running smoothly. The pace of play is never over 4 hrs. I usually play  in three hours and it happens at Squaw Creek. The lessons are very good they have an Exceptional teacher John who has an amazing knowledge of the game. The pro shop has so much COOL stuff for a golf shop. WELL DONE<//text>

Squaw SUCKS!  Wish zero stars was an option.  It's an over-priced, over-rated has-been mountain.  They routinely lie about snow levels and lifts in operation.  It used to be a skiers mountain and now it's a flat-lander-kook destination.  Unlike the old ownership, the new ownership doesn't care about the ski experience they only care about fleecing suckers and closing as many lifts as they can due to 'wind-hold'.  Don't bother, there are plenty of other great options.< /Review>

<text>On one of the nicest ski days of the season, the lifts had many mechanical problems.  The tram was closed (for more than just one day).  One lift was inoperable when the area opened.  Other lifts were in and out of service during the day.  It was a bit frustrating to be standing in line with little idea of when the out would be running again -- or, worse yet, stuck on a chairlift while the mechanics were at work.  One suspects that, because there were so many mechanical issues, this is a chronic situation due to substandard maintenance, rather than just an isolated bad day.<//text>< rate>

Squaw Valley is almost too big for KSL to manage on stormy days.  Safety is always first, and delayed lift openings ensure avalanche controls are taken and skier/riders get fresh tracks as upper mountain sections open as the day progresses.  Best bets on fresh snow days are KT-22 on the lower mountain, Broken Arrow in mid-mountain, and usually Solitude/Shirley to Granite around mid-day.  If not windy, then head up the Siberia Express and Headwall Express for colder and drier conditions at North Bowl and The Slot.  And when the Emigrant lift is fixed ski/ride the Funnel into Shirley Lake.  A lot of Upper Mountain terrain is hard to open due to buried lifts; however, it is worth the wait.<//Review>

Awesome ski/snowboard experience! Parking was easy and close to the mountain which allowed us to leave our lunches in our car (and not pay money to rent a locker). Renting snowboard and boot was very professional. They had a whole assembly line going which removed the confusion of who was going to help you. Fast forward to the end of the day and returning your equipment was very easy! :)

We had a few beginners in our group but it was awesome that the green runs were not just at the bottom of the mountain. We were pleasantly surprised to find a whole green run oasis at the top of the Tram. This allowed our group to split up but not have to worry about taking a long time getting back to each other.

Definitely will come back here again :)</review>

Nice parking close to the base. Good amentities at the base, lots of good areas to explore. Snow quality was not as good as Heavenly, doesn't seem to get as much sun and makes for a harder snowpack. Also seems to have a lot more wind.<//review>

<Review>The runs and snow were great.
For a first time there, they were terrible at directing us where to go to get tickets and hire equipment. We ended up queueing in the wrong shop (the inn ski shop), not squaw valley, before getting turned away. Then they gave us the wrong voucher to get ski clothes and had to call someone to switch the voucher out.
They don't rent jackets, and quickly run out of ski pants.</Review>< Name>

Expensive as f***. I can not see how $180 per day is justified. $130 if you buy at REI great mountain when there is a really snow but for that price I'll go some where else.< /Text>

Because during the winter you can ski right off the slopes and right inside and is also a two minute walk to any restraunt in the area</Text>

It's a "village" and when you have been to one you have been to all of them. There will be gear shops, a chocolatier, a toy shop, a Starbucks, and those carefully designed bricks that have been proven to make people slow down a bit.<//Text>

One of the most beautiful resorts in the Tahoe area. Lift tickets are more expensive than most but the size of the resort and variety of runs is well worth it.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>To be honest, some of the reviews of Squaw are not so hot, so I tried to keep my expectations in check. This was my wife and I's first trip to Squaw, let alone any ski area outside of the east coast. We had an absolute blast! Conditions were as good as they could be for being somewhat warm, the views and atmosphere are astounding. Traffic and parking was no problem at all because we made sure to get there an hour early to prep and catch first chair.

Some other's were upset that they weren't opening the lifts early, but it was no big deal, we were just happy to be in the mountains. Crowds were none existent for the first hour, then they set in and the longest wait was maybe 10 min, but later in the day the Funitel had no line so you could just ski right up to it.

The day was going great until I decided to do one last run while my wife rested, so I decided to take a whack at Lower Dog Leg, bad decision. Black diamonds are a little different here than on the east coast. Wound up taking a hell of a fall and breaking two bones in my leg, gear flying everywhere. Once the snow settled, a snowboarder stopped, helped me gather my gear and alert ski patrol. Took a ride down the mountain on a sled to their urgent care. Got x-rays taken, confirmed things were not great, got an air cast, crutches, and pain meds. So out trip had to end early.

That being said, everyone we interacted with on the mountain was great, employees were all pleasant, happy, smiling. Made for a great experience. Ski patrol was absolutely top notch, got me out of a hairy situation quickly and safely, did an absolute great job.

We will be back without a doubt!!< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I just got there 29/11/2017.
Snow is very good. Not too much crowded. I rided a tram(Gondola) for 46$ per person, its so amazing and good value. Don't have to wait because there are just a few passenger. Tram takes about 10 minutes riding and approches every 20 minutes. Tram ticket can ride small tram called Funitel with unlimited. All closes about 15:30 for the last passenger who wanna go up. The upper site have a station but buffet and Olympic museum are closed for construction but it's still great with café, terrace and ski school for beginner. The base floor is also good, nice architecture. Scenic view on the way to the resort is nice. I believe that you will love it like me.
PS. Sunset at 16:00< /Review>

This place needs no introduction. Make sure you whack the poles before sending it.

(If you are a beginner, don't waste your money here, you are not going to be taking advantage of this place)< /Review>

<Review>This is one of  the most poorly managed resorts I've ever skied at.  They can't get anything with pitch open, and proximity to SF means massive lines on the lower mountain (the only open areas). They stated wind hold today and Ave danger on a day with 0 wind and every other Tahoe resort was fully open. If there is av danger four days after the last storm it's because you haven't done your job yet.

Tons and tons of intermediates everywhere. Poorly maintained, badly managed, and an extremely sour vibe at the resort from all the  locals that feel their seasons were stolen by this crap management Co. This place badly needs a change in ownership.  Have skied all over the world, will never, ever return.<//Review>< rate>

<text>Good challenging terrain for expert skiers. Ownership sucks and mountain operations are terrible. Lifts like Broken Arrow and Olympic Lady almost never run. I've been skiing here for 35 years and mountain operations use to be quite good. New ownership (KSL) frequently stops or doesn't open lifts to save money. They are often short staffed. Lift lines, parking, traffic to get to the mountain are all horrible! We have nicknamed the KSL ownership "Keep Stopping Lifts" or "Keep Standing in Line". Even though they don't limit season pass sales, they won't refund your season pass if you get injured. Instead they have a terrible business practice of requiring customers to buy "insurance" to get any kind of refund if they can't ski. Talk about adding insult to injury! The only thing being insured is the profits of KSL! They are a big corporation that only cares about profits and they lack focus on customer service in what should be an enjoyable experience for all in a recreational venue.<//text>< username>

I went to Squaw Valley last weekend.  Beautiful resort.
I took the beginners group class.  This was my first time ever in ski boots whereas the other's in the group were familiar with the basics.  What I got was a patronizing instructor who spoiled the experience for me. (Asking me sarcastically if I didn't know I could skid on ice or if I was an A-type certainly didn't help.)  The good news was that I got my money back since I cut short my 2-hour class.< /text>

Interesting to read the reviews of others who had similar experiences.  The resort seemed short staffed and they  closed down lifts frequently during our stay due to "high winds".  When I asked staff why all the upper lifts were closed, I got a insulting response "are you a lift engineer?"
Extremely poor customer service and attitude!< /Text>

Great terrain but it is very poorly managed.
These guys can't keep lifts running.  Maintanence issues, understaffing,  just poor operational management.
I live in the area and also have a place in Colorado and I can definitively say that the difference in operational management is extremely palpable.  A lot of wasted powder days because these guys don't have their operational services on par with other resorts around the country.  Lines can be hours long due to mismanagement.<//text>

love this place due to there steep challenging terrain. Wish it still snowed there. Management has there head up there asses. They dream about being a destination resort but do not have the intermediate terrain that the general public desires. Nore do they groom well.Local resort northstar dose this well. They cannot keep lifts running. The management continues to not plan for any problems and they have lots. I have traveled around a lot and every resort I go is run far better.Also the snow pack changes due to the warmth but it is rarely Colorado cold here< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>This review is not about the ski area (which is beautiful) but about the Squaw Kids Ski school.
If you are considering group ski lessons for a beginner child (mine is 6): run away. Run away as fast as you can. Based on my experience this place is light years away from being able (or willing) to teach young kids the joy of skiing.
I enrolled my son in an afternoon group lesson for first time skiers (price in 02/14 is $169 including gear for 2.5h of ski lessons). What my son got for this was:
20 minutes gear fitting
30 minute juice break
Approximately 30-40 minutes sitting around in the snow and about 1h of actual playing in the snow which sums up to two rides on the magic carpet, a little intro to "pizza and French fries" and, well, nothing else. This is it.
Afterwards I talked to a very friendly and professional supervisor who had nothing of any significance to add to this. It appears as if this is very much the experience that is expected. He did mention that it was a very busy day (yes, Presidents' Day weekend is crazy indeed), but from my vantage point this is *his* issue to manage (staff up more, take fewer kids, hire more competent people) but should not make a first day of skiing a "I don't think I want to do this ever again, we were only sitting around" type of experience.
Based on my experience in Washington state this is not typical for kids skiing lessons. Snoqualmie, Crystal Mt both offered much better lessons for the kids (my older son did his first steps on skis there).

So yeah, run, run fast. I hear Northstar offers a more fun environment and less frustration.</review>< pictures>

Great ski resort, cheap(er) lift tickets available at Costco.  Easy access to lifts, shuttle bus available for parking, and a great beginner slope.</Review>

I've seen a lot of complaints about the instructors and man oh man, do I agree.  I wasn't someone that paid for the lessons, but I was another person on the mountain.  I almost collided with someone that was being instructed and it was a complete accident.  This person was going straight across in front of me.  I saw him and was moving out of his way as far as possible to the left.  He kept going to the left and although I thought I had enough room to move around him, he continued to move straight across in front of me.  By the time I was closer to him, it was too late to slow down enough to avoid him.  So I started to shout to make sure he saw me, narrowly missed him and our boards touched just a smidge.  I looked behind me to make sure he was okay and that he hadn't fallen.  He hadn't.

However, he was with an instructor that actually was telling this guy to cross like that!  The instructor started yelling at me down the mountain, cursing at me!  It was a clear mishap, but the instructor was not having any of it.  The instructor bombed down the hill and caught up with me when I was taking a rest on the mountain when I found my friends and husband.  I was ready to apologize and tell him that there was no harm meant, but he was extremely condescending, talking to me as if I was some reckless teenager.  "YOU - take your earphones off.  Make sure you can hear me.  That was completely your fault."  At that point, I was angry, "no... I tried to stop and because I couldn't predict where he was going, I was having trouble.  It was an accident."  "No" he says, "that was your fault.  You were not paying attention."  "Yes I was.  I couldn't avoid him, even though I tried."  The person that was being instructed was sheepishly looking on, as if he wanted no part of this.  The instructor clearly wanted me to apologize, but because of the way he approached me and his unwillingness to understand that accidents can happen regardless of how careful one is, I was NOT going to.

I told him I was going to report him.  He said, "go ahead!  Here's my card, I hope you do report me!"

This guy completely ruined my time at Squaw and I'm not willing to go back...especially with so little snow and the ticket prices increasing.  There are far more mountains to choose from than have to deal with this crap.

He's supposed to set a good example on the mountain rather than continue a culture of anger and yelling.  Awesome job guy.  I hope you were a seasonal employee.<//review>

<review>Not much going on in the village when I went. Wanted to take the tram up to top but it was closed. They want a lot of money to ride that thing. I suggest looking at Groupon for discounts< /review>< Rating>

Home to more Olympic athletes than any other resort I know about and for good reason.  Much to do at 'base-camp' and lot's of advanced terrain.  No rush to head home either, probably the biggest ski apres vibe in all of Tahoe.  Low on cash? Try the general store where you can get a tall cans of Pabst for about $2 and good deli samiches for a few more.< /review>

This resort gets some bad press from time to time but, rest assured Squaw Valley offers the best spring skiing experience in the country!
From consistant snowpack to highcamp hot tub and bar to apre ski gambling nearby this is what warm weather skiing is all about.
I haven't missed a spring trip since 1981 and I'll see you June 10th weekend!!<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Text>Arguably the best mountain Inn of Lake Tahoe. Other favorites Kirkwoods and Sierra on Powder days. At Squaw Valley you can hang out  next to the fire  after you're done  in the evening  or grab dinner . Northstar is a fun place to go skiing or snowboarding, but it does not have the amount of difficult Terrain that you find at Squaw Valley. Northstar does offer ice skating , music and a series of fire pits all in the central area for hanging out during the day or in the evening after riding , which is the only feature that I prefer over Squaw Valley. Kirkwood and Sierra have a great training but don't have the evening atmosphere.< /Text>< Date>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>8584zender hit the nail on the head; it can be very frustrating to fly in from out of town to spend a long weekend here. If it's storming then you're screwed and if it's not storming then there's no fresh snow.

I don't know if it's just poorly laid-out (how could a world-class ski resort be so crippled by wind?) or if there is just a lack of staff to get all the jobs done that need to get done to open the mountain on time but it is extremely frustrating to be there during a storm that is dumping snow by the foot that you can't ski on because the lifts won't or can't open on time or at all.

Btw, if you are skiing with beginners (or you yourself are a beginner), you may want to consider another mountain. The big area of green trails at the top of the mountain looks enticing on a trail map, but you can only ski there if the top of the mountain is open (definitely not a given). If the top of the mountain is closed due to wind or storms then there is almost no beginner terrain on the entire mountain.

It's a shame because it is a great mountain with awesome terrain that should be one of the top resorts in the country.</review>< gmap_id>

< review>
I have to admit, I like Squaw MORE than both Heavenly & Northstar. I think it does the whole "Mega-resort" thing with more understatement then either of the other two. I REALLY ❤ Alpine Meadows (which is also like Kirkwood -- my other medium sized mountain favorite) and the fact that you can ski both Squaw and Alpine both in a day and mix it up is SUPER convenient for the experience. I still prefer Alpine over Squaw because I am a fan of smaller less mega-resort type places, but Squaw I actually do like VERY MUCH. More
than I expected to. This year I opted to not renew my Epic Pass to Heavenly, Northstar & Kirkwood and bought the Tahoe Super Pass to Alpine, Squaw, Sugar Bowl + Sierra At Tahoe. TOTALLY worth it! Next two trips are more Alpine/Squaw and then Sugar Bowl. I like this pass more than the Epic, because you get a whole extra mountain (4 versus 3) AND, the other offers and benefits kind of outclass the Epic Passes. However, I miss Kirkwood, so I MIGHT eventually go back to the Epic pass for a season, but I TOTALLY recommend the Tahoe Super Pass -- ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!</review>

Squaw Valley is a really beautiful place, but the prices are skyrocketing. I suggest going there with a tent, because it's place where you would be outside for most of the time.<//review>

<text>I was a Lifty there a few years back. Best mountain in Tahoe. best terrain.
granite chef, headwall, KT22, broken arrow.
best runs in CA
Most advanced riding
KT22 is the best place to be on POW days
but the locals line up at like 6
so it doesn't last long
lifties are all stoned.
but that's every mountain in Tahoe.
but they discourage drinking on the job
so that's probably a plus for you

<Text>Very expensive for what you get. $169 for a day pass, that's more than I'd ever want to pay. Clearly Silicon Valley money at play here, but I have a hard time seeing the logic in "punishing" the people who actually show up with extreme pricing? Mammoth anytime instead<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A paradise on earth without words. The scenery seen from the top of the mountain is so beautiful, and there is also a pool in the summer. Tracking with guides is also provided. At the end of July, the hot sun is falling, but the snow is not melting. Swimming in the pool is a place for many to remember. Good.

말이 필요 없는 지상낙원. 산 정상에서 본 경치는 너무 아름답고 여름은 풀장도 있다. 가이드와 함께 트래킹도 제공된다. 7월 말 뜨거운 태양이 내리 쬐는데도 눈이 녹지 않고 있다. 풀장에서 물놀이는 많은이에게 기억에 남을곳이다. 강추.</Text>< UserId.>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Great place to spend time both in winter and in summer! Many active activities! Just keep in mind the place is at an altitude of about 2000 meters above sea level. Beautiful nature, in a special starry sky. Full service, choice of classes for any taste, will not leave anyone indifferent!

Отличное место, чтобы провести время как зимой, так и летом! Много активных занятий! Только учтите место находится на высоте около 2000 метров над уровнем моря. Красивая природа, по особенному звёздное небо.

(Translated by Google) It is a beautiful place, as it is, it is too expensive. However, it is very attractive with a thousand things to do, always have something to eat and with very good attention. Undoubtedly a beautiful place to vacation in winter and go skiing. I repeat, it is very expensive, a salad leaves 15 dollars, a hamburger leaves 14, skiing per day leaves 500 dollars and others.

Es un lugar hermoso, asi como es, es demasiado caro. Sin embargo es muy atractivo con mil cosas para hacer, siempre tener algo que comer y con una muy buena atención. Sin dudas un hermoso lugar para vacacionar en invierno e ir a esquiar. Repito, es muy caro, una ensalada sale 15 dolares, una hamburguesa sale 14, esquiar por dia sale 500 dolares y demás.<//Review>

It can be quite crowded, especially on the lift ah, leading to the blue and green slopes. Come early. It is best to park right next to the lift on the left side of the parking lot.

Отлично покатались: было не очень снежно и не все склоны открыты, но даже несмотря на это мы провели два прекрасных дня здесь. Может быть достаточно людно, особенно на подъемник ах, ведущих на синие и зелёные спуски. Приезжайте пораньше. Лучше всего парковаться прямо возле подъемника на левой стороне парковки.< /review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Good rooms, a little small and a little dark. The beds are absolutely fine and you can sleep well in them. The rooms are equipped with 2 TVs (satellite). The bathroom has a bathtub and toilet. The kitchen is well equipped with 2 hotplates, a dishwasher, a refrigerator with freezer compartment and a microwave. The balcony is not overly large, but it is absolutely sufficient. There is a swimming pool, 3 whirlpools and a sauna.

Our ticket scanners sometimes do have to take passes that have issues (if this was your first time scanning your Ikon pass at Squaw, some of your information may not have fully transferred from Ikon to us yet.) While we do have the ability to fix 85% of pass issues at the gate, sometimes the passes need to be brought back to the office to figure out the issue. The ticket scanner should have issued you a ticket to use for the day and you can pick up your working Ikon pass from the ticket office at the end of the day.'}< /Resp>< gmapID>
