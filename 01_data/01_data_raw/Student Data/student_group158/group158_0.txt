I haven't had Philippine food is ages, and this tastes just like I remember.  We had the Chicken Adobe, Lumpia and Pancit, and it was delicious!  Prices are good, and portions are large.  Staff is friendly, and very helpful.< /Review>

<Review>excellent food, service, and exceptionally clean. met the owners and found out they've been open only a month!

i appreciate their dedication to perfecting their current menu rather than sacrificing quality and flavor for menu item quantity. that being said, i am excited to hear they will eventually expand their menu. we will definitely be back and tell all our friends there's a Filipino spot in town.🇵🇭<//Review>< Date>

I frickin love this place, not just as a Filipina but as a general foodie. The portions here are made for Pinoy dining which means family style. The sinigang, pancit, kare kare, they are all delicious. If you're dining alone, try my favorite all day breakfast items like tapsilog, tocilog, or fish. If you want a fresh taste at Filipino classic dessert, you MUST try halo-halo. My boyfriend and I fight over every morsel and that's kind of the "fun" in this dessert. Every scoop is a surprise.< /Review>

Me and my brother came here to celebrate his birthday. Traditional delicious Filipino dishes. Loved the Pancit and the “purple” ice-cream and fried bananas were amazing! Comfortable family vibe and easy parking.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I have been craving Lumpia since the place in my town shut down years ago. Friends make it for me here and there but I can never get it when I want it. As kid at one of my friends birthday parties she would also serve Lumpia. It was so good and I've loved it ever since.
I searched for local spots that served Lumpia. Lots came up but only a few in my "backyard ". So we made the drive. The location was easy to find. Parking was easy too. Due to current circumstances they are only serving takeout which was fine for me. The staff was very friendly and helpful with ordering food. The menu has lots of items to choose from.
I came for Lumpia only this trip and it did not dissapoint. I was so elated. I ordered two orders of the pork Lumpia and it was not enough. The Lumpia was cooked just to my liking and the sauce to go with it was a perfect match. When all the Lumpia was gone I was so bummed. Obviously I'm going back it's just a matter of when. Probably sooner than later. I introduced them to my son as well and it was a hit for him</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNl6u5f6uMCgTsUcOwpndzCoGwvix80yyzCYit=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnAS4DIV0R20EAdKZn2siAHhkNdGt02gsMpeAN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

Food is good, taste like homemade but they give VERY little meat. If you're paying for something with chicken it should have more than a few small pieces of chicken. My noodles had just a few pieces of chicken on top and under was only noodle no meat at all. I could have paid less and gotten vegetable noodles. We were still hungry when we got home. Hopefully they will improve.</Review>

This 7 month old Filipino restaurant is patronized not only by Filipinos but by the international community as well.
The food is authentic Filipino and they contribute in promoting Filipino food as a  global brand.
Do not miss the Lechon Kawali- crunchiest deep fried pork belly in liver sauce, the Laing Or taro leaves cooked in coconut milk.
To die for a The “Halo-Halo” desert topped with purple yam ice cream. I will surely be back for more.  My only suggestion is to have Dinuguan or Pork Blood Stew🙏🏻!!! Kudos to the owners Ted and Trisha👍</Text>

It's good to see a traditional Filipino restaurant in the area. Can't say too much after one visit since Filipino menu's offer more than meets the eye. However the lumpia Shanghai was good as was the presentation. Definitely give it a try if you're in the area.< /Text>

My mother is from the Philippines and my husband is from Hawaii and we saw this place gearing up for opening.  Finally got over there for lunch.  I had the Pansit (egg noddles) with shrimp, Mom had the same thing and Dad had Chicken Adobo.  Food was great, service nice and the atmosphere in the place was cozy, clean and welcoming.  If you love Filipino food go!<//text>

DELICIOUS!

Growing up in a very large Filipino family, I came in with high expectations and was not let down. On my first(and second) visit I had the pork sisig which they topped with a fried egg and served on a bed of rice and banana leaf. Rich and savory seasoning that brought back some childhood memories. My friend, a white girl whose never had Filipino food beyond Lumpia, had the egg noodle pancit and halo halo; she loved both.

My third visit I had the Lechon(crispy pork belly, pictured). A perfect crispy crust sealed in succulent fatty pork belly.

The restaurant is extremely clean with a contemporary aesthetic and flourishes of Filipino cultural artifacts. Customer service, by whom I assume to be the owners, was excellent every time. I highly recommend for anyone looking to try Filipino cuisine or something different.<//Text>

Reminds me of all the wonderful Filipino food I had while living in Hawaii. Very tasty.  Very friendly service . Food was delicious. We had Pork adobo and chicken adobo. Also lumpia and pansit. We visit here again. One thing for next time. I wish the adobo had pepper corns in it or an option to have it with or without and maybe some bay leaf flavoring I guess it is hard to please everyone when cooking for the mass public but when you say Filipino food we are coming for the real thing. Still give you 5 stars🐼< /text>

I've taken my daughter to this urgent care numerous times but after tonight I will NEVER be returning again! They never sent over my daughters prescription to the pharmacy and would not answer their phone and then closed early so I am STILL not able to get it! What is the point of having an "urgent care" if you're going to treat your patients with zero urgency OR care!<//text>

<Review>I have been here several times and have regularly relied on this service instead of having a regular healthcare provider. But today really ruined this place for me. I showed up at 1:30pm and the sign said that they were closed and would return at 9 o’clock. What does that mean? I called their phone number and nobody answered. The message about their hours of operation said they take lunch from “about” 1 to 2 PM. OK. I sat in my car and waited until 2 PM. By 2 o’clock nobody had returned. By 2:15 PM nobody had returned. By 2:30 PM still nobody had returned. I was hoping to be seen for a bladder infection and was in terrible discomfort, needing to use the restroom. The place was completely dark with no signage indicating that they were closed for the day. I still could get nobody by phone and there was no answering service to explain what was going on.</Review></record>

DISAPPOINTING Service. Will be our last choice for future, though closest to our home.
This was our second visit to the Urgent Care. First time was okay and we had no problems. However, this second  time we experienced bad management service. They took two persons out-of-turn before us even though I  had signed in first. The receptionist is untrained and on top of that is argumentative and not sorry and instead cover up her mistakes.
If such is the level of front facing service, I have to wonder about the experience and quality of medical treatment one would receive in the back.
When we checked in I filled in the requested forms and gave my I'd/insurance card etc. We were told it would take approx 30 minutes of waiting. We were asked if we had been here before and I  told the receptionist that  my wife had been here before and this time it was for me.
Our wait went on for a full hour. During that we witnessed the receptionist arguing with some  couple over their bill. Also, I noticed that they took two persons out of turn. They had signed in after us but were called in before us. When I told the receptionist about that she said that she did not know how the other two and gave no assurance as to when we would have our turn. She came back telling me that somebody is going to come and speak to me and oh by the way you have to fill in another form. I told her that she should have checked all paperwork during check in and saved us time.   Instead of being apologetic and trying to  get us in quickly she started to argue with us and blame us and the couple before us for giving her a hard time. After some time the business owner came out and tried to figure out what was going on but in all that we felt they all were not sorry or caring enough to fix the issue. She did not say whether she was going to get us in right away and it seemed that we would have to wait our turn all over again due to no fault of ours.  again so so we walked away from there not happy. They did not make any point to amend anything and thus fell below our expectations. DISAPPOINTING.  Bad service.</text>

<date>1602132653357<//date><review>They never answer the phone because they're "super busy" (even though it's always deathly quiet in there).

They are unprofessional, refuse to take ownership for their mistakes, and have no empathy.

I received a notice from my previous insurance stating an amount was owed to a lab I've never heard of. I called the lab to discover it was a COVID-19 test. And I've never been tested for COVID-19. To make matters worse, the lab had received completely wrong information. My first and last names were swapped, incorrect address was on file, incorrect date of birth, etc. They were only able to locate the bill because I had the account number from the insurance notice. Come to find out, the specimen came from Willow Urgent Care. It then dawned on me that I received a strange phone call from them a few months ago. The girl told me my results came back negative. I was so confused and told her she had the wrong person.

I finally got a hold of Willow Urgent Care and informed them of the mistake. Instead of a sincere apology, the girl responded with "Excuuuuse, me!!!" You can imagine how livid I was after that. And the others are refusing to admit any fault in the matter. What a great clinic...<//review><user_id>116241451377756519747< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Very poor service. Their lunch "hour" is very random, the lady whom I called, said they would be back from lunch at 2 PM (on a Sunday) and so I got there at that time. I waited until 3:30 PM for them to even come back, and then I had to wait another hour to get seen. Also, they were seeing other patients who arrived after me. Overall I was there for 3 HOURS!!!!!! just to get tested. I called three weeks later on a Sunday to get re-tested for Covid and they say they don't do testing on weekends, I asked the lady what she was talking about because I got my test done three weeks ago on a Sunday, and she was confused (I have the paperwork/email to prove I got tested on Sunday). Absolutely no sense of Urgency for an Urgent Care and VERY wishy washy information is given. Definitely not coming back here.<//Review>< pics>

Very rude, slow, and unorganized. I’ve been in my car waiting for 3 hours to get my test. First the woman comes out and says “Aren’t you supposed to be here another day?” I told her no I’m scheduled for today. Then she tells me she needs to go look for my paper cause they may have shredded it!!!! Didn’t hear anything back so I went inside just for them to rudely say, “we’ll come to you”
I’m still waiting and I see them coming out to test people who came way after I did. I’ll never come here again< /Review>

We had a lady provider this time we'd never had, unsure what her title is, rude, arrogant, said our child wasn't ill, we had to take him elsewhere, xrayed...turns out he was very ill. If we'd listened to her he would've had pneumonia in a few days. Usually had a great experience, just hope when you go you get a good provider.</text>< date>

<review>This urgent care is so frustrating. They're business hours should reflect when they will last take a patient but they dont. Call before you go there and waste your time. Don't forget they close for lunch so be cautious of that as well. It's never fun to waste your time in the waiting room only to be told they're closing for lunch.  Dr's are ok but the way they run the business is beyond frustrating. When they first opened it was an amazing urgent care, but notice most high rates reviews are from years ago but the majority of low reviews are more recent. I won't return.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is usually our go to urgent care. However the last 2 times, service has been unbelievably slow.
Today, we arrived at 2:40. By 2:50, all 3 rooms were filled. 3:00, 2 patients had already left. 3:09 the third patient left. This means we are back to all 3 rooms empty. I asked the receptionist when they would be calling more patients back as 2 rooms have already been open for 10 minutes. She stated “the doctors might be doing paperwork and it is up to them to decide when they want to get another patient.” I really don’t like that response. I understand paperwork, but it should not be the doctor’s decision to decide when they are ready to see someone.
We waited until 3:20. And no one had even come out to pick up patient clipboards yet!! That means 2 of the rooms were left EMPTY for 20 minutes and the other for 10! We decided we’re going to leave, and inform the receptionist. Then, she couldn’t even find the form he had filled out when we arrived all of 40 minutes prior to be able to toss it. She said “when they call you back I’ll tell them you left.”< /review>

<text>I came to urgent care on the 7/12/18. Their staffing was amazing! It wasn't busy. I got seen really quick. The physician assistant "La Cheisa Bell" was great! The best PA by far I've ever met. She made sure all my concern was met. Cared for my condition more than I expected! Jessica Mitchell is one of their medical assistant; she was super awesome! She made sure I was fully cared and taught me how to use my accessories. Not only that, I was transfer to x-ray. Jessica called me after to direct me how to take care of my condition! I am greatly appreciated! Their staffing are very friendly and they actually care for their patients. One of the BEST urgent care I've been too!</text>< Pics>

<Text>My nearly 2yo son had a bad fever (over 103). I took him here on a Saturday around noon (a nearly 2 hour drive from where we live in the mountains). After filling out the papers we had a maybe 10 min wait before we were taken back. They almost immediately diagnosed an ear infection in the little guy. The staff were super friendly and did a good job of getting people in/out quickly. I was impressed.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This could be a great place!!  Dr. Hansen and the other docs are wonderful!!!  I can't say the same about the newer doctor, Dr. Hernandez, she doesn't make eye contact, does not seem to listen very well, was very short with me, not good bed side manner at all!!  The other doctors do not seem to have this issue.  Front desk blondie girl is awful!!!!  When asked a question, she completely ignored me; she also had me waiting in the waiting room, after my visit with doc was over!!  I had gone up to pay and she told me to have a seat. I thought that was odd as I'd never had to do that.  I was in miserable pain and really just wanted to go home!!  Finally, doc came out and asked her why I was still there.  The girl was very rude and cold.  She definitely needs people skills training if she's going to be at the front of this office.  Besides these two issues, this has truly been the best urgent care we've been to and we've used them quite a bit.</review>

The doctor barely asked questions, she assumed it was one thing by just looking. Even though I told her I know it's not because I'm not contagious. She didn't spend enough time with me. Never again!< /Review>

The front desk lady was nice and helpful. The staff were very patient and kind with my two boys. My boys are autistic,  and require a bit more time and the staff was absolutely amazing! Minimal wait time and excellent service. Highly recommended.<//Text>

<date>1559314128086</date><Text>We have taken our kids there twice. Both time we were in and out in no time and the staff was great. Here's the reason for the low review. Somw time after the 1st visit, we received a notice from a collection agency saying we owed them although we paid them in full. The same thing happened to us after the second visit. It was over 6 months ago and we are still receiving letters and calls from their collection agency. Every time we provide proof of payment, dates the checks cleared etc., and without fail, another call. I would love to use them, however, If this is going to be our experience with willow urgent care we will go elsewhere.<//Text>< rating>

Right when I got there I was taken by one of the doctors. Super quick, staff were all friendly and took their time to ensure all my paperwork was filled out properly. Only down fall- they take a lunch break and on one of the days I attempted to go, it appeared something was going on as they took about a two hour break. Highly recommend this urgent care facility.<//Text>

I visit Willow Urgent Care today with a really bad knee pain. Since I got the door, the secretary treated me real nice. She came a picked up the clip board since i couldn't really walk. I only waited no more than 15 minutes for they to call me in. The nurse took me in on a wheelchair and was very nice and attentive with me. The doctor came in later on and just like the rest of the staff was nice. I would go again to this urgent care if needed.<//text>

Went in on Mother's Day for a sinus infection. Waited more than an hour just to see a NP with a bad attitude that seemed to decide before even speaking with me that I didn't need to be there. Was told I didnt have a sinus infection and the sudafed I was taking was "my best friend." I DID have a sinus infection and wise physicians shouldn't be telling pregnant women such things. I hope for the sake of other patients that NP isnt needed on a regular basis and was only there cause of the holiday.<//review>

Wonderful Service. Receptionist Jessica was very kind and prompt. Dr. was wonderful. My son was injured on the back of his head and it was bleeding a lot and they calmed him down made him laugh and fixed him up. He reopened his wound about 45 minutes after we left and they were closed but we called anyway. They answered and told us to come right back in.  They were amazing. I would recommend this one to anyone.< /review>

Website and sign on office say they are open until 7 pm on Saturdays, get there at 6:45 pm and the door is locked, there are two people in the office.  My suggestion - skip this place and go down Herndon to Premium Urgent Care.</Text>

<review>Advertised that they are open until 7:00. We arrived at 6:20. No one was at the reception desk. When so.eone came out 2-3 minutes later, they informed us that they saw their last patient at 6:20. When we pointed out that their sign said they were open until 7:00, they said the office is open until 7:00 but they stop seeing patients at 6:20. How would anyone know this? We won't be back.< /review><response>None</response><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

Went in for heart palpitation. Their EKG machine was old and had to be sent up 4 times. After the fourth time it worked. The results were given to me and told it looked fine but if I had symptons again to go to the ER and folliow up with my doctor. I decided to go straight to the ER. Once released I went to seethe doctor and had told my doctor that I had gone to willow urgent care. My doctor requested my record from willow and was told that there was a fee of 25 dollars. Ususally doctor to doctor request should mot have a fee attached. Unethical practice.</Text>

<Review>The care was fine.  The issue was and is that they use Lysol disinfectant in each room after the patient leaves.  Sounds innocent enough but the problem is that if you are asthmatic, it compromises your breathing and I ended up with an asthma attack on top of the reason I came which had nothing to do with asthma.  She took me to another room and it took 10 minutes to get it under control.  I told the assistant to not do that anymore because I am not as bad as others and they are setting themselves up for a serious occurrence.  She shrugged it off.  During the visit, I could hear her continue to use the spray in the other rooms.  After the visit, I told the front desk that they need to discontinue use and she said "oh thats just what our office manager likes to buy".  I tried to be more direct and explain the consequences and she also lacked interest.  This is a serious flaw in my opinion and not one that should be taken lightly if you are an asthmatic.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I went on a Saturday right as they opened at 9am. I had a severe bladder infection and didn't want to be in a gross Emergency room. Stuck out the excruciating pain until Willow Urgent Care could see me. Nurse was super friendly, they were fast. Doctor Knapp was clear and easy to understand. They sent my prescription over to the Walgreens on the same street. I was in, examined, out, had pills, and recovering within an hour. Excellent option if you don't want to sit with the stab victims, pregnant women, and coughing elderly at the ER. Small place though!</Text>

Thank god I called before I went . Lady who answered the phone was very rude. I asked if they accept medi cal , she said we aren't contracted with any insurance , you just pay the cost. Then I said I wanted a pelvic exam how much would that cost. She said a pelvic exam like are you having cramps . Then proceeded to ask if I had insurance or not . I told her medi cal and she said we don't contract medi cal while I thought you said you don't contract with any insurance . Anyway just lost a potential patient due to rude service .</text>

There is only one doctor working here. Took 2 hours to see him and I came right when they opened. Needless to say it is time to find a primary care, I won’t be back.<//review>

Today, my family and I had a bad experience at this restaurant due to unprofessional, and unethical behavior of three waitresses.

As we walk in, my family and I were acknowledged by three waitress, but did not get greeted nor seated after 10 minutes. It’s was not busy, the restaurant  was empty only two couples were seated.

After receiving our food, my family and I had no silverware nor napkins. I ask three different waitresses, but they were ignorant or just intentionally making us wait for silverware, napkins, tortillas, and refills while our food got cold.

I ask to speak to the manager, because it was getting out of hand. I also requested to know the names of the waitresses in order to file a complaint.  So one of the waitress claim to be the manager, which was odd, because the previous waitress stated that the manager was not on site today.

I have no intentions of ever returning due to lack of professionalism and unethical behavior coming from the three waitresses.< /text></record>

Great food, clean restaurant, friendly staff. Nice place for dates, family or large groups. Menu is large, awesome weekday lunch specials. Prices are higher for dinner but still fair for the delicious nicely portioned food. Also the seafood seemed to be a specialty that most other tables were ordering.  A new Colton favorite.< /review>

<Text>Enjoyed a family dinner here and will be back!
Don't judge a book by its cover, the outside is a little bland but once you enter you will see why it's ranked so well.
The food is great, the servers are the best, even the venue is beautiful.

The wait time for the food was a bit longer than I'd like, but the flavors and quality are well worth the wait!< /Text>< pictures>

Sadly food lacks any flavor, the seafood is drenched in soy sauce/fish sauce. The octopus is horrible in taste and tough. So sad, such a nice local for lackluster food.< /Review>

<Review>I never write a reviews but this restaurant really has to start seeing their reviews and put some attention before they close down. I went yesterday to eat out with my family to celebrate my husband birthday and it was empty. I figure because it was Thursday not many people will dine in. So we decided to give it a try. We order 6 dishes total in which they where brought to us 10  minutes apart. We didn't enjoy eating are food at the same time. They mess up on our daughters plate and didn't have the courtesy to even apologize again another 10 min wait. No flavor on the food rice and beans where horrible and the agua de tamarindo "" was so diluted just tasted like sugar water. Do not order lobster super hard and chewy with super burn potatoes very over price restaurant for the service and quality of food. DO NOT FALL INTO THE PRESENTATION OF THE FOOD. That I do give it to them they spend more time decorating the plate than flavoring the food. Will never go back again.<//Review>< pics>

The first time we had Luis and he was Great,last night was our 2nd time and it was horrible! Short staffed for being Cinco de mayo,our drinks didn't have alcohol our bbq wings were luke warm no little plates to put bones on, Never got our order of taquitos! Not sure if we'll go again unless I call ahead of time and ask if Luis is working.</Review>

Ok so first off, the food is amazing! Very tasty. The two stars is because of the horrible service. So I counted 20 people outside here with me. We’ve been waiting over 40 minutes for our food. When our appetizer came they didn’t bring plates. Never filled our water. When they refilled husbands ice tea they forgot the ice. Hello, we’re outside it’s hot!! Ike I said the food is amazing but expect to wait awhile for it.</review>

We had the chicken enchiladas and hard tacos with shredded beef. The enchiladas could have had more sauce but overall they were delicious, as were the tacos. The rice and beans were even more delicious. They reminded me of my mom's, which not many Mexican restaurants do. The chips and salsa were fantastic as well. We will definitely be going back to try other menu items.< /review>

<Text>The food hear is great, the staff is friendly and if you're Hispanic the beans and rice are very nostalgic.
Their burritos are meaty and very filling, I had an appetizer of a Shrimp Cocktail and its flavor rivals Mariscos and other Fish focused areas. I love it.< /Text><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Food took forever as well. Had to keep asking for items that should’ve automatically been included in the meal like the tortillas for the carne asada plate and crackers for the shrimp cocktail. My niece had a pizza and her drink also took about 20 minutes. I don’t know who rated this place to what it is but don’t come here.< /review></record>

<Review>It's a very Nice & clean restaurant, well decorated, food is good and their music volume is perfect, not too low but just high enough to hear it and still b able to have a conversation without yelling at each others ear👍 customer service is good also! But they close early even though it's the week end.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Horrible service, unpleasant experience due to waiter named Brandon. Who was obviously  unhappy to be there. He took our order didn’t return and when asked why our drink was missing the fruit he than purposely ignored us.
After asking for water and realizing he wasn’t returning, I had to get up to get a refill,  waiter was very unpleasant.
Waiter slammed drink down on table, slammed bill folder down.  Totally discourteous, young lady apologized for his behavior and lack of service.
I would not recommend this place for worry they may get the same waiter. Food was good<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

We waited for our food for 80mins, upon receiving our food it was like warm and we had NO UTENSILS I finally got up & started passing out the utensils as the hostess was passing them out one at a time. The other hostess were rolling their eyes at our group. Food was pretty salty. I was here before it was no problem but I will not be back!<//text>

To long of waiting for time. Wasn't a busy time at all. I understand inspection was being done, however to treat customers poorly isn't no excuse. You have other employees to get things done or just even explain to your customers a longer wait than usual. Be respectful of other ppl time.<//text>

Placed my order wrong. Then they brought my wife's dish out. By the time my food came out my wife was done with her food. And it ruins my experience there with my wife. We couldn't even enjoy a hot dinner together. And that's what we came there for the great experience. At the end of the night they didn't deliver I was sad I was embarrassed humiliated And told to never return so we left. And I was injured and crutches and it was mother's day can you believe that...<//text>

The service was not so great. We arrived at 11am, right when it opened. We waited 10 minutes for our drinks, and then we waited an hour for our food. The waitress did apologize, and said they only had 1 cook, after we got our food. The food was good, but a little cold. I ordered a steak with broccoli and asparagus.< /review>

Everything about this place was amazing. The food was great, the customer service was on point, and the place was extremely clean. The host and server we're extremely happy and nice! The only issue is the prices are a little high, but the quality and service makes it worth it!< /Text>

It was my first time here I entered and the restaurant and it was empty, I sat down with a friend and ordered some drinks the waitress was very friendly and gave us our chips and salsa..she came back about two mins later and took our order.
Our food came about 20 mins later which I thought was a little long but I guess you say it was worth the wait because the was very delicious..I would definitely came back.</text>

<Text>I loved this place, ordered gucamole as an appetizer to enjoy with my drink. Very cool about customizing my drink. Gucamole was HUGE and so flavorable, tasted like homemade chips to go with the dip. Drink was AH-mazing, followed the recipe perfectly. My friend joined me, tasted my drink and ordered the same thing. Very attentive and gracious server, so nice and accommodating. She was a perfect reflection of the restaurant, which was empty at happy hour. People!!! Go to this place and get your Mexican grub on! I moved here a year ago and this is the first place I've eaten those food was so fantastic prepared and plentiful. Very yum. Our meals were so very delicious, I had to order something for my husband. He was so happy when he saw what I brought, both of us are San Diego natives and grew up eating awesome Mexican food. Very happy to find this place!!

My only cons too all these pros? On Google it stated happy hour specials, and this being Taco Tuesday, I was surprised by the lack of specials. Also, even though you got good portions and wonderfully tasty food, it was a bit spendy.

I'd love to see street tacos as an option. I think hiring someone for Cinco de Mayo as an appetizer alternative, charging $1-$2 per taco, would be amazing.

And I'm babbling like a brook. Let me tone it down. I'm coming back for Cinco de Mayo and am bringing a ton of friends, cannot wait to try it again!</Text>< Pictures>

We were greeted and served by Jessina who was very knowledgeable and professional. We had the chili Verde combo plates, tacos and guacamole. Everything was outstanding! They have a large menu of various items to please everyone's appetite. I would encourage everyone to come in and give it a try!</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I loved this place, ordered gucamole as an appetizer to enjoy with my drink. Very cool about customizing my drink. Gucamole was HUGE and so flavorable, tasted like homemade chips to go with the dip. Drink was AH-mazing, followed the recipe perfectly. My friend joined me, tasted my drink and ordered the same thing. Very attentive and gracious server, so nice and accommodating. She was a perfect reflection of the restaurant, which was empty at happy hour. People!!! Go to this place and get your Mexican grub on! I moved here a year ago and this is the first place I've eaten those food was so fantastic prepared and plentiful. Very yum. Our meals were so very delicious, I had to order something for my husband. He was so happy when he saw what I brought, both of us are San Diego natives and grew up eating awesome Mexican food. Very happy to find this place!!

My only cons too all these pros? On Google it stated happy hour specials, and this being Taco Tuesday, I was surprised by the lack of specials. Also, even though you got good portions and wonderfully tasty food, it was a bit spendy.

I'd love to see street tacos as an option. I think hiring someone for Cinco de Mayo as an appetizer alternative, charging $1-$2 per taco, would be amazing.

And I'm babbling like a brook. Let me tone it down. I'm coming back for Cinco de Mayo and am bringing a ton of friends, cannot wait to try it again!< /Text><Date>1553057499375</Date></record></dataset><record>

Horrible service they over charged me and refused to refund or give me credit after the manager reviwed my bill and stated she seen a discrepancy, They added a $20.00 gratuity when we recieved poor service, Food was returned as it was cold, Orders were wrong, It took forever to get any service, The manager said to come in and they would make it right, When I returned the owner would rather lose buisness than to satisfy a customer, He said no credits, But did say I could have 2 $5.00 Micheladas...My bill that was wrong was $150.00 I was over charged approximately $70.00...Shame on the owner, I will never return and I will spread the word to all my family, friends, And colleagues, Uglyness will never prosper...Don't bother going there...Horrible service and owner.<//text>

Very clean classy joint. Hostess and serving staff where very attentive .warm bollio with butter n oil was awesome. food was great very flavorful shrimp cocktail was perfect. Only dislike would be portion size.
The prices are a bit high considered location but no a big deal.i payed 23$ for steak  picado.very small portion of meat.
I will return n i hope they are s success...< /Text>

<Date>1542517890502<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Very nice place, we went for dinner, we ordered meat fajitas and fish fillet and fresh waters ....
Everything without exception was badly seasoned, the chips salty, the sauce too watery and tasteless, the fresh waters tasted like pure water with a little sugar, the food in general is bad, I don't think about giving them another visit.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT

(Original)
Muy bonito el lugar, fuimos a la hora de la cena, ordenamos fajitas de carne y filete de pescado y aguas frescas....
Todo sin excepción estaba mal sazonado, los chips salados, la salsa demasiado aguada y sin sabor, las aguas frescas sabían cómo pura agua con un poco de azúcar, la comida en general es mala, no pienso en darles otra visita.

(Translated by Google) I highly recommend this restaurant, it is nice inside and has a beautiful decoration with nice music and also is very clean. The presentation of the dishes is elegant. The food has good savor. I ate the aguachiles in red sauce, they are deliciousos and an appetizer of melted cheese. In the molcajete, I would love the red sauce of green tomatillo.

(Original)
Recomiendo mucho este restaurant, esta lindo por dentro y tiene una hermosa decoracion con musica agradable y ademas esta muy limpio. La presentacion de los platillos es elegante. La comida tiene buen savor. Comi los aguachiles en salsa roja, son deliciousos y un aperitivo de queso fundido. En el molcajete, me encantaria con la obcion de salsa roja de tomatillo verde.<//review>

<Review>Whoever the register person was in here was either having a really bad day or jusy not nice to me. I was so excited from the reviews and the images to come here and chose this place over another that had similar stars. Once walking in I greeted him not once, twice, but three different times in a loud voice, he didn't acknowledge any of it (third louder since I thought he didn't hear me). Then, once ordering it was like talking to a flat wall, no emotions, no excitement or even a look at me, just at the register. When I did change my mind of one of the orders because of the price, he voided the order with what I distinctly heard was a huff in his voice of irratation while doing the order. Sorry, there's greeting customers with some kind of happiness and not at all, he did the latter. If you don't want my hard earned money, just tell me up front. I even asked if he was having a bad day out of care and he said he was fine, anyway, fist impressions sometimes do last, not wasting money and my excitement here, since they don't want me here for no reason it seems. Usually very nice to everyone I come into the store with to gauge their personality, this one failed. I did wish him a better day, at the end, the food was pretty good, but the experience really lasted with a bad memory.<//Review>< Resp>

We came here because of the good reviews and the food was very disappointing. The place was completely empty when we arrived and it took about 14 minutes for our food to arrive. The pho broth was extremely salty and sweet, nothing like any pho I’ve ever had. To dilute the taste, it took a cup of water, multiple limes and lots of basil. It’s really a shame.< /text>

<Review>Food is delicious,  for what it is,  a front counter service restaurant. Seating is awkward because it is not made clear that you need to order and pay before sitting down.  The rather large portions are brought out to you and the employees check on you often. Will return if I'm in the area,  but not worth a special trip.<//Review>< date>

The highly-rated restaurant here in our region! Last night, I came here to eat my dinner. I was so glad that your staves offer me to have your bestseller dishes since it's my first time to visit your place. I was feeling delighted and satisfied with their overall service, and I thanked your staves for that. Until next time! Highly recommended!</Text>

We live 1 min away from Tin and that's the best thing ever. When we first moved here, I had been smelling something super delicious every time I open the window but I didn't know what it was.<//text>

Ordered kimchi ramen and it was a bomb
I ordered take out and I was on time but it's as cold which sucked and the kimchi on the side spilled all over my new car and marble. Gyozo was good and generous portion but very cold.</text>

Being Vietnamese it’s so hard for me to find good pho in LA as most of the pho restaurants in LA are owned by non Vietnamese chefs. Stumbling upon Super Pho I will be honest it hard for me trust reviews. (Nothing personal to anyone) l am a huge critic when it comes to Vietnamese food. And I will say Super Pho nailed the aroma and the flavor of the broth. I’m glad I can find a little piece of home away from home. Quite delicious and the waitress with the short hair was super sweet. I ordered for pick via Postmates and she already had everything ready and saw me pull in to bring me my order. I got amazing energy from her and can tell she is kind! Definitely will order again!</text>

A soup is amazing.  I thought tasting  is the best in there.  Specifically all vegetables are so fresh.   Asian style service... so detail service.  I love so much.< /review>

Favorite pho right across from one of my favorite bars. Bigfoot West. Pre or post drinking meal. Also try beef yakisoba & super eggroll. 😋</text>

I liked it... But small. Probably uncomfortable if it's busy. Food is delicious. I had the house pho. Lots of people ordered their bowls which looked very good. Quiet atmosphere. Large windows helped the small space. I would go back alone or with small group to try other dishes.<//review>

It's simple, quick and inexpensive. It's exactly what Pho should be.</text>< Gmap_id>

<rate>4< /rate><review>My rating is closer to 3.5. I've ordered from here many times and pho is pretty good with reasonable portion sizes, but the teriyaki is just average. Egg rolls are also good, fresh spring rolls not so much. Barely any parking - so you'll most likely have to circle the area looking for street side parking instead.< /review><UserId.>101486947765046808369<//UserId.><Date>1509054212665< /Date>< pictures>

The food here is delicious... But their new waitress is horrible. Aside from not remembering your order, she doesn't bring you water or ask you if you want anything to drink... The only reason  we come here is for the pho... Otherwise, we'd chose a more customer friendly atmosphere...< /Review>

Solid OK for Super Pho (from my first experience). Service a little confusing - do I order at the counter or is there table service? Doesn't matter so much for me but other people seemed a little fussy about it.  Went up to the counter to order some veggie pho and non-veggie for the SO. Veggie broth is quite plain but there's plenty of vegetables included as well as sauces to please your palette. SO's large bowl of pho was tasty, just lacking in meat portions. Easy and quick service and parking (street) was not difficult to find on a Sunday evening. Super Pho will satisfy a pho craving for a decent price - as long as you're not a vegetarian ;)</review>

<Text>Good food but it's inappropriate when the guy in the back is blasting his opinion and cussing he would just not shut up. We waited forever for our check after asking for it twice. The waitress sucks ass guys she didn't check on our table until the opinionated guy got on her about it. Overall great food sucky service just get your stuff to go.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Small place but serves pretty good pho and is inexpensive.  Tiny indoor seating, might fit about 6 people before it becomes claustrophobic.  They have limited outdoor seating, don't come here if you're a group of 3 or more.  Service is really fast but the parking is really bad.  The last time I went the broth was very salty.  The cashier lady was nice-enough but it's the type of place where none of the workers ever smile.  The food prep / dish-washer guy was wearing a marijuana hat, and it's next door to a seedy looking massage parlor...so go figure.  The overhead speakers was blasting contemporary rap music and various songs from the 90s.  The floor is linoleum, the type you expect to see in a bathroom, and has permanent dirty spots due to years of neglect.  The AC has never worked (to my knowledge).  The lighting inside has a yellow-ish tint, which may give you a headache, but during the day-time it's actually not too bad due to it's large windows and natural lighting. The quality of the food is "good enough."  It does boast self-serve veggie station, which I appreciate, but a lot of the veggies are either wilting or day away from getting thrown out.  The prices though, are fairly decent, costing you less than $9 for a bowl of pho which also "good enough."  As I commented earlier, the soup base has a noticeably salty taste.  They are open late, until around 11pm, sometimes Midnight if it's the weekend.<//text>

Pho is good. Great prices. You get to get your own vegi add ons unlike most places that give you a little plate on the side. One of my fav Pho places!</text>

Service was good, and we appreciated that they had 2 vegetarian options, but the vegetarian pho needs lots of work.  My wife and I both tried it and she couldn't finish it.< /text>

<text>Recovering from the night before? Go here. Small, intimate spot for great pho! The broth is delicious and they serve you generous portions at a good price. Been going here for years but haven't tried anything else. The Bahn Mi looks spot on for cheap but when you want pho, you want pho. Give a try.<//text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pictures>

After heading to Phorage and not being getting my pho craving satisfied, I decided to check this place out. It's a smaller place than Phorage, but the food was decent. They have one high chair for the place and you order your dish up front. It's definitely cheaper than Phorage and I felt there were more noodles in the bowl. I especially liked the all you can add condiments. I love onions and basil so I was excited to learn that I could add as much as I wanted to! I even got an extra helping of noodles! Looking forward to going back.

3 stars because I noticed that some of the condiments weren't very fresh.< /review>

<Review>1. I’m in a rush, give me a one sentence summary – found a hair in my food and they were very rude about it when I brought it to their attention, no thank you!
2. My experience – I’ve been here a handful of times and actually thought it was ok, until the most recent time where I found a hair in my food.
3. The food – I don’t think their pho is very good, the meat always is pretty tough and/or bland, and the broth isn’t anything special. The serving sizes are huge – a small easily is enough food for one person, and two people could split a regular. I like their banh mi sandwiches much more than the pho, particularly the spicy pork & kimchee sandwich.
4. Parking – kind of a pain depending on when you go, it’s tough to find parking in the residential streets immediately surrounding the restaurant, parking on Venice usually is the best bet if there’s open spots.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<user_name>Young Cho< /user_name><time>1301539029344<//time><Review>I have been in the mood for pho for quite sometime and since my favorite spot in koreatown closed I thought I was stuck eating at pgo show but to my suprise I found super pho right down the street from my house. Two issues with this place. No parking (street parking only) and too small of a dining area. Price is much better than pho show and portion size is generous. I got the house pho with everthing in, steak, tendon, tripe, meat balls, brisket, tendon. My wife got the rare steak and egg rolls. Not bad. I have had home made pho, pho 99, OC pho joints. You name it I have probably eaten there. This is not my favorite place but not much to choose from in west la. Definitely going back to try there other items. The server was cute too.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>It was alright. The pricing was more than what I'm used to and they could've packed in a bit more meat in my orders of pho to-go.</Text>< Time>

Ordered teriyaki special: WAY to much rice; very little meat; little sauce & even less veggies. Only tried because of reviews.< /Review>

<user_name>Chris Jin Ki Kang<//user_name><Text>I rarely like beef teriyaki in general, but Don's beef teriyaki is the best I've had -- it's not rubbery like some other places. Their chicken and spicy pork are also really good. None of their meat is too sweet nor salty. Their taste is well balanced. Definitely recommend!<//Text>< date>

< Review>
Nice place to eat without driving far away. It is same menu you could see in other place like teriyaki, sandwich.
But taste is very good and different because I feel I could feel the 'love' in their food. Very friendly kind. I would recommend to all the people nearby.<//Review>

<review>Great hole in the wall for a quick, delicious and price point sensitive lunch. Tiny little setup run by a korean family - heartwarming service despite the minimalist ambiance.

Also have a couple of beers on tap for the really challenging days.< /review><rate>4< /rate><date>1543269033967</date><response>None</response>< pictures>

Great food, great service, everything from the teriyaki to the pastrami sandwich is amazing. The owners are two of the nicest people I have ever met. I once forgot my wallet and when I tried to cancel my order they said i could come back and pay anytime. Very clean interior and prompt, friendly service. A must try!<//Text>

<review>Dont know why this place has any good reviews! I got teriyaki shrimp and the shrimp were VERY overcooked, rubbery, and smelled so fishy. They were definitely cooked with no seasoning, boiled I think, and then teriyaki sauce was sprinkled over, but it didnt leave any flavor on them. They tasted like they weren't cleaned at all and had been marinating in their own, old fishy juices for days and were on the verge of going bad, but were cooked anyway!(I ate one before I realized how bad they were) They were not deveined completely, still having pieces of poop in them! Then, as a side, you get a bunch of bagged salad and cheap rice with very little meat for the price. I dont go for teriyaki to have bagged salad with italian or ranch dressing! I go for the terryaki! My boyfriend got a burger which was equally crappy. Dont recommend anyone to eat here.<//review>< gmapID>

Best teriyaki in town!!! Amazing beautiful sweet people. You can feel the love. Food is amazing!
A lot of people go for the teriyaki chicken or beef. Doesn't matter, it's a win win.
I just tried the shrimp fried rice and it's really not that great. So if you have it in mind, go for the beef/chicken teriyaki instead.< /text>

I had the pineapple Vegan Dairyfree Whip. And I’m sure glad I did.. my kiddos had the mini and tiny swirl. It was sure to please. The place has endless toppings as well.</Text>

<review>Happy Yogurt is great! The owners and employees are super-friendly, and their prices are low. They always have a dairy-free option, and they change up their delicious flavors regularly. They offer many different sizes, and you can earn free yogurt with their stampcard program. Bonus: the place is always clean. We will definitely go back for more!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>New Owner as of about the first of 2013. Her enjoyment running her new business is obvious, and the place is freshly painted, redecorated, and she has a big screen on the wall usually showing Disney movies (my kids love it). The place was never dirty, but its clean as a whistle now, and always enjoyable to go to. Her yogurt menu is varied, and she changes it often enough to keep you trying new flavors if that's your thing. Tons of toppings that are fresh and tasty, and you can get it by the cup or any one of several types of cones. I've always liked this place, but it's even better now. A great place to have a seat and enjoy a tasty snack in the cool AC!</text><name>Ray Trussell</name><response>None< /response>< Date>

<review>The yogurt is fantastic and their prices are great. We don't like the new location as much and the new cups have caused me to buy smaller portions from them. A larger size of yogurt needs to come in a styrofoam cup. And those larger cups are unwieldy to handle with the larger footprint.

We'll keep going back; Just not as often and with smaller portions in our purchase.< /review>< pics>

While many customers favor the new, wider diameter sizes, your feedback will prompt us to bring back the polystyrene cups in the "large" and "giant" sizes as an option for those, like yourself, who prefer that shape.

Awesome store. Been there as long as I can remember, the owners have gotten older right along with me!  Great selection, and friendly, expert service. Very reasonable prices as well. All the accessories need are available here and suitable for beginners to professional. Highly recommended.<//text>

<Time>1519634415726< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>These guys rock. I bought a Sony A7R II from them during the Sony trade-up event, where I got $200 off MSRP and they bought my original A7 (2013 model) for a generous $250, yielding $450 off. Sadly, though, that A7R II was defective and had bubbles under the screen. They agreed to exchange it for another new A7R II, but there weren’t any in stock, so they ordered a new one from Sony. In the meantime, they lended me a Nikon D810 and a 24-70 F2.8 free of charge. Kenneth, especially, was empathetic during my experience.</Text>< pics>

First time customer here and the experience was great! Christopher was a big help with finding the gear I needed, and he made sure I was aware of the cost for the filters that were on display behind the counter. Would definitely visit again!</Review>

<review>The restoration department is not very professional and reliable.
Two weeks ago,  I have taken a couple of pictures for restoration, was told they would be ready on may 27,  when I went to pick them up, the young lady working behind the counter couldn't find my pictures, after asking many times my name, finally she  found my order, and she said, " Sorry, they are not ready yet, they will be ready until next Tuesday,"  So I asked if that was for sure, and she could not give me an assuring answer.  I decided to take my pictures back.  I am fearful they would lose my pictures, and I cant afford that, these pictures have a great  sentimental value.  I did not like the manner in which she approach the situation.</review><date>1622259973042<//date>< pictures>

<Review>Not only did Paul’s Photo have exactly what I needed (Canon Mount Adapter EF-EOS R, which has been on back order for MONTHS with every other retailer I’ve seen), the website was simple and it took me less than 2 minutes to order it.

The product was shipped quickly, on time, and very well protected. I haven’t seen actual packing peanuts in ages. Paul also put some wrapped candy mixed in with the packing peanuts, which was such a great surprise. (I had been pooped on by a bird an hour before, so the little surprise of finding my favorite candy in the package was wonderful).

Will definitely be choosing Paul’s from now on. Amazon doesn’t make my day like that.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5< /rating><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b1c80a23d4d:0xb38ff80390aa1a80</Gmap_id></record>

Best place to get high quality prints! Everyone in this shop is so kind and helpful, and Jeff (who works in the photo lab) is a genius. This was my first time ordering fine art prints and they were so flexible and helpful in the entire process. I sell prints of my paintings online and I will be using Paul's Photo for all of my prints!

Paul's Photo continues to be the premiere photo shop anywhere. They're extremely patient and helpful, taking the time to make sure you know how to use the equipment you just purchased.
Right now they're careful to make sure both staff and customers are safe and will be able to enjoy their purchases.</review>

<review>I had been wanting to go to Paul's Photo for a couple of months but It's a 50 mile drive. But yesterday I made the Trek. OUTSTANDING experience! Johnnie helped me for almost 2 hours. He was polite, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. I asked to see and examine 4 different cameras. Not only were they all in stock but Johnnie shared a great deal of expertise. While we were examining the Fuji X100F the other gentleman behind the counter showed me his personal  X100F and some of the accessories he has and uses. I asked about some premium  photo printing paper and Johnnie brought out samples for me to see. I ended up buying a new compact Nikon for my wife with all the accessories and a few other goodies. It was nice to deal with a real professional that never once was pushy. I have watched several Youtube videos that Mark does for Paul's  Photo and I just had to check them out.  I will be a customer for life!  They will even ship and help over the phone! To top it off... this morning I got a personal email from Mark thanking me for making the drive and supporting them. CLASS ACT! Thank You!< /review>< pictures>

Went on one of their Night Hawk photography workshops to shoot the Downtown Disney fireworks. Had a great time and learned lot.

Mark is a great instructor: very nice and you can tell he loves photography. It's always nice to be in a group with people who have fun and enjoy the same as you.

Highly recommend Paul's Photo. Will be back again. Thanks Mark & the rest of the Paul's Photo team.< /text>

It ended up being basically the same price as a certified refurbished one I was looking at elsewhere. Gotta go with the new, no doubt. But what makes going in a great experience is that the folks in here will chat with you about gear, techniques, locations and basically all things photographic. They must have spent a good half hour talking to me about wildlife photography and post processing techniques the last time I was in.

Ordered Sigma lens for Sony.  They charged my card.  Received email order confirmation.  No lens for a week.  Called the store.  They claim they left me a voice mail to tell me that they could not ship the lens because of Paypal problem.  But now they are out of stock.  They did not leave me a voicemail.  Never sent me an email or text. If I did not follow up, they would have just kept my money.  Terrible service. Would not order from them again.

This is my response to their reply below.
Stop lying and man up. You guys never left me a voicemail and you are just using Paypal or my alleged lack of response as an excuse.   I checked my phone record. No calls from your store.  And, I used Paypal many times without any problems.  Even if address is "unverified", you already charged me so where is my lens?  Or, did you charged me for the lens and then sold it to someone else?  Or, did you charged me for a lens you never had.  Either way, unsavory business practice.</Review>

Gerry Imura was super helpful in assisting me in picking up camera, tripod, and was informative in setting up camera and demoing how to use it. Thank you Gerry!

Edit: We had a little trouble setting up our tripod right before an event and Gerry went ABOVE AND BEYOND in trouble shooting over the phone. Wow— a great testimony to shopping locally. I would not have gotten that type of customer support from Best Buy.< /text>

Brought in my vintage Revere Camera a while ago, they told me it was useless and would not buy it, they also said it would be impossible for me to get film and process 8mm film. Well, I found 8mm film is still alive, so they basically tried to crush the spirits of an aspiring artist! I do not know who those employees were, but they were not photographers or artists...< /review>

In a world where most purchases are made "on-line" (and largely "sight-unseen"), Paul's Photo is almost UNIQUE.  If you have photographic "questions", or are seeking GUIDANCE,  Paul's is a place where you can talk to real people who are knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about photography.  You then have an opportunity to actually TOUCH & HANDLE the equipment you are interested in.  Plus, I find their prices to be competitive with any you can find; either on-line, or the "New York super-stores".  Finally, the "after-purchase" support options at Paul's Photo ensure that you have access to as much (or as little) help as you need.  GREAT store!  Highly recommended!</review>

<review>Rude, lying, unprofessional, staff. Bait and switch prices on rentals. To them, "one day" means from store open, to store close...not 24 hours like everyone else in the world. And when you bring this to their attention, "pro's" like "Jerry" blame you for being a "manipulator." Just look at many other reviews all stating how awful he is. He's the kind of person that takes the joy out of photography.</review><userid>103826770468373533030</userid>< Gmap_id>

Let's start with some positive. I had been a customer for a while and liked to shop there because most the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.
I recently sent my wife to purchase photo paper and they just handed it to her without packaging (that you need for storage so it does not get damaged and it is how a NEW product is sold!). When I saw it, I ask her to take back. She went back to store and had the misfortune to meet Mark, the owner. He was very aggressive and intimidating towards her and told her that he will not take back the product (it was still unused with the plastic un-opened). Maybe Mark thinks that since he is dealing with a woman, it is OK to behave like this. When I called to request a meeting with him, he decided to refund the money. I don't care that much about $36, but the fact that he was acting in a harassing way towards my wife, made him lose a customer. You have great employees and I liked your store, but because of you, we will never return to your store again.</text>

Maybe the best small photo retailer in L.A. For sure they are the best in the south bay Beach community. The service is great and their knowledge is unparalleled. Sometimes you may have to wait a bit, but that is because they treat everyone with the utmost care and respect. They are teachers as well as sellers of photography gear. They also offer superior print services for excellent prices. I love the family vibe<//Review>

Been delving into film photography and decided to stop by this camera store. I bought a Minolta XD-5 from here and it has been the best investment I have ever made. I keep coming by to by my B&W film from here when I don't want to wait on Amazon for it. Great employees, good energy, love this place.< /Review>

I have gone to Paul's for years and I have found them to be exceptional. I certainly don't fit the photographer profile and am not a big spender, so many camera places "shine me on" but they have been patient and answer my questions.  They are direct and straightforward, so they won't oversell or try to tell you something that is not true.  I read some reviews and it is possible the person with the negative review did not like an answer.  By the way, I took in a lens that I had dropped, certain it was toast, and instead of selling me a new lens, they adjusted it (it was not on the right setting) and sent me on my way!  I have attended a class, and it was great.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Paul’s Photo in Torrance CA is fantastic!  This place has been around since the ’60’s.  The people working at Paul's know absolutely everything there is to know about all types of cameras; they know all the tricks and they are extremely friendly and helpful.  My son had a defect showing up on all the photo’s from his DSLR camera.  We tried cleaning every surface but we couldn’t get rid of the defect.  One of the sharp guys working at Paul's diagnosed the problem, showed us how to clean the image sensor, cleaned a hair off the sensor for us using an air bulb, and took a photo with the camera and verified that the defect was gone- all within five minutes.  When I asked him how much I owed him he said no charge!  We ended up buying a couple camera cleaning items and a body cap for my son’s camera.  Paul’s has pretty much everything you might need all in one place and has extremely knowledgeable people to help you find what you need.  Thank you Paul’s!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>When i wanted to print out some iphone photos, I had no idea where to start.  Fortunately, a friend recommended Paul's Photo and I was able upload and get them shipped to me.  Their website makes it SUPER easy to upload, crop and choose the size of print you want - very intuitive and easy to use!!!  And you can either pick up at their Torrance location or have them shipped - when I paid extra for 2nd Day shipping, Paul's refunded my shipping because it was necessary - WHAT AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!< /text>< gmap_id>

Their food never disappoints and their service is above and beyond great. Love the beet salad, pork belly gyro, and the zucchini chips, leave room for their Greek yogurt<//Text>

An easy 5! We came here right before the pandemic and also once during for takeout. Love the Lamb entree here. The lamb is tender and flavorful, and the sides are also very good; we got the side of fries, Greek salad, and tzatziki. But what took us by surprise was the Baklava frozen yogurt for dessert -- it was sooooo good.</text>

This is my second visit, and the food gets better every time. Food is fresh, savory and well woth the price. You won't find a similar place in the vicinity to rival this location. I live in the valley, the drive is well worth it. Today my daughter and I had the chicken and lamb pita, respectively. Both were delicious and filled with goodness. The pita bread is soft and consistent, it won't break apart, and meat portions are substantial, to say one was enough to fill me. Their gr fries are off the hook!  one person can eat two orders, easily. Plenty of parking on the back of the building. I look forward to my next visit.<//review>

<review>Great Mediterranean food in Downey!  I usually get the chicken souvlaki merida with a GR salad upgrade. The online ordering was very convenient with an automatic text telling you that the food is ready for pickup. After paying online, you call them and they will bring out the food to you curbside.< /review>< pictures>

Honest truth, these were the best lamb chops I've ever had! and I've eaten lamb chops all around the world. They were beautifully seasoned, had not one bit of fat, and they were cooked to perfection! They had several options of food and presentations as well as meat by the Kilo 💪🏽💪🏽..after dinner we were full but not stuffed and yucky feeling. Make sure you also get some of their mint lemonade its amazing!! Will definitely be back ASAP.< /Review>

This place is really good! I had a pork wrap but I should have gotten a salad since I also ordered hummus and pita, which is freshly made and extremely delicious. The serving of the pita came with Greek fries, shoe string fries, nicely seasoned. The presentation of both the items I got, the hummus with pita bread and the pork pita was elegant and I didn't want to eat it because it was pretty. The food was delicious as well. I also got freshly made cucumber lemonade, yum, so refreshing! Definitely coming back to try different items from the menu. The establishment is really clean and they have gender neutral restrooms (2). The entrance is from the parking lot but you can see the restaurant from the main street. Definitely will came back, fresh ingredients and clean establishment.< /review>

I recommend this place. Very cute place in an unassuming strip mall.< /review>< pictures>

Been wanting to try this place for a while since we can't get back to Greece this year.
The gyro is pretty good, not authentic, but pretty good (has pickled onions slices in it??). The Avgolemono is a hard pass, as is the Bougatsa. The avgolemono is very watery, salty, and unlike any avgolemono I've ever had (it has chives in it??). The bougatsa cream is lacking in flavor and kinda doughy.
Their frappes are pretty legit though, and use Greek frappe granules to make them.
It's very hard to find authentic Greek food on the west coast, and we had high hopes driving from San Diego. The hunt continues.<//Text>

<Text>Been here twice and both times the customer service were great and on par with customer service in higher end restaurants that I've experienced. The menu options are perfect. Not too much and not too little. Also easy to choose from. Although I'm not familiar very much with Greek food I got a little overwhelmed on choosing because I'm not sure what some items are. Looking at photos help. And of course the food is has all been amazing. Could be a little hotter though if I had to pick one thing to complain about.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x80c2cd3373d70bbd:0x61ae0fd389bcd583</gmap_id>< Rate>

<response>{'time': 1606863449889, 'text': 'Hello Edgar,  your food is still waiting for you. We have no problem making you a new one if you decided to come back.  As far as the cough, unfortunately these things do happen in the kitchen.  After reviewing our video footage my staff member did follow proper kitchen protocol when coughing or sneezing.  She did not cough into her hands but rather in her underarm/ shoulder area and with a mask on. She also stepped away from the cooking area to do so.  So per health department guidelines and Serve Safe standards this is the proper way to do this incase a cough or sneeze attack comes upon you.  We wear our gloves and change them constantly, wear masks and disinfect regularly.  unfortunately sometimes while cooking over an open flame in a kitchen with a mask on the smoke penetrates your mask and it makes it difficult to breath.  This effect results in coughing and or sneezing.   Again we do apologies but we also recommend not jumping to conclusions.'}< /response>< gmap_id>

I loved every single bite of my meal.  The roasted sweet potato was perfectly seasoned, halloumi cheese was impressive, garbanzo salad tangy and Balanced, and the dip was spicy and cheesy. Oh and the baklava..... Wowzers!!!!</review>

This is an absolute must have. Modern twist on traditional greek cuisine.  The food is fresh and really satisfying.  The menu needs to be explained by the staff being that its a bit confusing. Other than that, all good!< /Review>

The place was great. Clean and bright atmosphere. Good tunes. Excellent food well to my liking. The pits I ate was lamb, and let me tell you it was delicious. The meat just melted in my mouth. 10/10 would eat there again< /Review>

<Review>Affordable and very delicious. I had the merida plate with thinly sliced lamb which included salad, rice, fries as topping, and one side of choice. I loved the additional side of choice option because most Mediterranean places the sides are fixed. I chose tzatziki because I love large quantities of it. The salad was unique; overall the plate was delicious and reasonably priced under $15. I also ordered a side of halloumi (not pictured) which was amazing ($7 for four slices and pita). Great customer service. Cashier was helpful with suggestions and the food runner always checked in to make sure everything was ok. I hope this place sticks around because they'll be my new go-to for Mediterranean/Greek food.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYxW-SSkY1_fA6lIIr95Ds4O0I5f6cKZmiltBQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Great place to eat! I have eaten from Pita GR 4 or 5 times since they opened this year.  The food is excellent and the way the food is prepared is beyond reproach - safe and healthy - not cooked in aluminum and not cooked in Soybean oil.They use 100% olive oil on their salads etc. and cook their fried foods in the drippings from their gyro and chicken roastings, etc.   I do not have any experience with their deserts.  Apart from them I recommend this place wholeheartedly as a healthy and delicious place to eat.</text>

<Text>This place used to be Opa! Cafe. It's been renovated and modernized. Looks great, the staff is great and the food tastes great. I have the feeling it's still the same menu with added wines and beers. Also, since it resembles the same service type of many eateries I think it's also pricey.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2cd3373d70bbd:0x61ae0fd389bcd583< /gmapID></record>

I absolutely loved it and wish I lived closer to go more often! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. IT'S SOOO GOOD!❤ I'm craving this now!</Text>

(Translated by Google) Man from heaven, the food is a tasty and beautiful train and I got belly full with the amount.
I like a restaurant that gives me the comfort of sitting, choosing, and ordering during my stay there, but this is one of those you need to order at the counter before you can get your order at the table. So you have to decide what you want to eat and drink right from the start. To me this is boring, but within their proposal, they are amazing.
I ordered Lamb with rice, hummus and salad.😍😍😍😋
I already want to go back.

(Original)
Mano do ceú, a comida é um trem de gostoso e bonito e eu fiquei de barriga cheia com a quantidade.
Eu gosto de restaurante que me dá o conforto de me sentar, escolher, e fazer a ordem durante a minha permanência lá, mas esse é daqueles que você precisa fazer a ordem no balcão, pra depois receber seu pedido na mesa. Então você tem que se decidir sobre o que quer comer  e beber logo no comecinho. Pra mim isso é chato, mas dentro da proposta deles, eles são incríveis.
Eu pedi Lamb com arroz, homus e salada.😍😍😍😋
Já quero voltar.< /Review>

I decided to try a new spot and I found a Jem!  Not only did Ky produce a very nice and quick haircut, she was a lot of fun to be around.  I would definitely recommend Ky to a friend -- guy or girl's cut.  Best of all Ky was down to earth and not caught up in what Humboldt has become; but is a real local.</Text>

Ky did a great job with my fashion color and cut! The pictures are from March when I first got it colored, and from May...its growing out so nicely! Although I'm sure I could have had a cheaper cut and color somewhere else, im glad I went here. Its been a great value for the money spent. Very friendly, easy to talk to, and respectful lady as well.<//Text>

My boyfriend always comes here to get his hair cut - KY really knows what she is doing! His hair always looks amazing right after the cut and through the grow-out period.
On top of the great service, the shop is so cute and clean. I love to hang out and read magazines while I'm waiting.
The place is lovely and I definitely recommend it!< /text>

She did a great job to straightening my hair! It’s was on a holiday, after her closing time,  Ky spent 5 hours to cut and straight my hair, and after 1 month I am writing this review, my hair is still very straight, not many places can do Japanese hair straightening in eureka, and I am so glad to find this place can do it very well.she even showed me her lovely garden and gave me a lot of vegetables to take home:) And yes of course it’s kind expensive, but it totally worth it! Wonderful service and amazing results!< /text>

<text>Absolutely an AMAZING experience. She was so friendly and made me feel so comfortable. I havent had a real hair cut in over 10 years and i was nervous. But she did such an amazing job. Gave me exactly what i wanted plus some! I got my hair done for my birthday and i would 100% go back to her. She runs the entire business by herself and does an INCREDIBLE job at it. She gave me input on the haircut and I trusted her and she did not let me down. 10/10 I recommend going!!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Walked in with no appointment and was immediately greeted and welcomed in for a haircut, Ky is a very nice lady! But I feel the price of $40 to get my hair thinned and cleaned up (styled instead of men’s haircut price) is too much. It only took her no more then 10 minutes and it felt rushed because a customer with an appointment walked in and was waiting at the counter. That being said, even though I didn't like the price I still paid it because it was agreed upon before hand and I thought there was going to be a lot more done then what was. BUT I could've gotten the same experience at RMH in the mall for $25. Ky a word of advice, the best businesses adjust there prices to compete with the competition. I understand you charge how you do because you feel it is what you are worth. But the majority of your bad reviews have to do with the price being too high. If that's a common theme then its probably true compared to your competition. If you really care about your customer experience and about the online reviews then you would listen to what is being said and adjust accordingly. If your prices go down, I will definitely come back! I will say I do love my new haircut :)</Text>

This is the best experience I have ever had concerning my hair I’m sure I will have her do other services as well. When I called I was asking about if she cut curly wavy hair because I’ve never found anybody that could do it and enhance my face?  She knew exactly what to do and it didn’t take her long at all either I just left it up to her it was like art for her.. The atmosphere there was comfortable and relaxing, peaceful which I like in a salon, who needs the stress? Her products are well priced. She treated me kind and caring. And when you’re around  souls like that it makes the world a better place. Anyway, she open the door for me I am in a power wheelchair and walked me out it was easy to get out of her parking lot since I drive. Her name is Ky. Thank you Ky.</Review>

Ky is AMAZING! She definitely has an eye for hair because she knew exactly what I needed in a haircut, as well base my cut on the style I showed her. I have very thick hair and every time I ask for it to be thinned out, nobody ever does it right. KY DID! I haven't had a perfect haircut like this since my hair stylist in Texas; that was about 8 years ago. The hair cut can be a little pricey, but that's the price you pay for a quality cut. I'm so happy I found you, Ky! I'll be returning here for all my future hair needs. Thank you for the great experience!<//review>

Good conversation but way overpriced. Paid $70 for a simple trim that took 15 minutes. Also cut my hair a lot shorter than what I said after I repeatedly said I didn’t want it that short. Don’t recommend.</Review>

Do not go to this salon! I got a TERRIBLE haircut with one side significantly longer than the other and the back looks like a mullet. I only needed a trim, less than 2 inches and she charged me $65! She also thinned my hair without asking me! When I returned to get a refund she was very rude and refused to work with me. Please do not go to this salon, you will have an awful experience!<//Review>

Awesome.
Cared most about making sure my hair was healthy and not to damage it. We even enjoyed cake together afterwards.
And very sweet environment.

One of the most horrible hair experiences I've ever had. First she doesn't believe COVID is real and refused to mask and repeatedly asked me to take mine off. Then she talked non stop for the entire visit. The whole visit was topped off with a bad color job, horrible highlights AND she added over $100 to her original quote. Save your money and run from this place.<//review>

I walked in with no appt at 3pm and was seen right away. As a woman with a short buzzed style I wasn't sure if a full salon was the best place to go but she did an amazing job with minimal direction other than "please fix my pandemic cut." Quick, friendly, and convenient.</review>

I wanted to try something new,  so I went over to KY's and she took care of me real good. She was super friendly and though it was my first time there, we talked as if I was one of her regular customers. I told her I wanted a haircut and she went straight to it, and made suggestions she thought would look good on me, and I love that so we went with it, and I am happy with the outcome. My hair was super long, so her price was really expensive, but it was worth it. I recommend her 100% and will be back soon.< /Text>

<text>I found Ky’s Hair Designs in an online search as I’m new to the area. I had not had scissors taken to my long hair in three years. I so wanted to keep it long but broken hairs were bothering my face all of the time. I thought it would have to be layered a lot (which I usually don’t want) in order to look and feel good. I was so pleasantly surprised at how much hair Ky was able to keep while giving me a cut that is soft around my face and still long yet professional looking. I could not be happier! 😃👍🏻< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZPNKasxT_P0S9B6xlgHEpBvg2sC1Us4H16810=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Time>1603211248702< /Time>< UserId.>

If you’re looking to put your trust in the hands of an artist, Ky’s got you covered! I came in with a vague, but well enough defined, idea of what I was looking for and left with a great haircut.

I wish I lived in Eureka so Ky could be my hair care professional for life! But I was just passing through during a trip across Northern California.
Ky is Obviously incredibly gifted and had amazing instincts about the most ideal cut for me. My hair color touch up was excellent as well. Thank you, Ky!<//Text>

Ky was so great! She is so friendly and professional at the same time! I have wanted my hair done like this for so long and three stylists have tried and not succeeded. It looks so much better than I even expected it to! Ky thank you so much for all of your time and effort, I know my hair is thick and it was a mess when I came in. You fixed me up perfect! I live ten hours away but when I come back through I WILL be coming back! I don’t know how to add before and after pictures but I wish I could!! :(</Text>

A ten minute hair cut was $55, and the woman cutting hair wanted to cut a bulk of hair underneath my child's hair. I had to ask her to stop, and I was the one who combed her hair - and she charged $55 dolars?!? She was rude, unprofessional and WAY too costly. Never, ever will we be using this traumatizing place.< /Text>

<text>I was looking for a new place to get a men's haircut and tried Ky's based on the good reviews. I was not disappointed! Ky is extremely devoted to her craft and offered some great advice from the many years she's been in business to ultimately provide one of the best haircuts I've had in years.

She is a fascinating, hard working woman so if you are looking for a friendly stylist who is not afraid to offer some advice on how to style your hair and chat you up while doing it, you will feel right at home. If you are looking for a quiet, boring experience where the stylist does not make suggestions or offer to add a personal touch, you may not get as much as I did out of Ky's Hair Designs.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< time>

The cottage was nice, although the owners will make up any excuse so they can keep the deposit, they charged me an additional 100$ to have a guest over for one night. If you do stay expect them to complain about your electricity usage. Although they are nice people, they ask to many questions, I was expecting a quite place where I can cook,and relax. The owner kept asking me day after day to vote for her on a website for best hair salon, even thought I never got a hair cut. They said I can use the washer and kitchen,but they did complain about me using it. Over all I had to pay an additional 750$ for my stay. I accidentally had a few scratches on their frying pan, I said I'd buy a new one, she said no so she could get the damage deposit. The owner did however offer me a ride to the grocery store, but I declined. I appreciate that you guys let me stay with you, but I didn't appreciate the extra charges. I'm sorry but I'll take my money and spend it on a another place that won't charge me extra or try and find an excuse to charge me extra money. Your intentions were shown. Have a nice life.</review>

Also the quality of my haircut was exceptional, and she was very fast. And to top it off, the building is in cool dome shapes which is just really cool.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Ky’s Hair Designs is my favorite! She has great vision for each individuals unique hairstyles/cut/color. Initially I brought my children in for a quick trim, and Ky quickly became the #1 go-to for my whole family. She is also great to chat with, she is funny and personable. We have been getting our hair done by her for years, and have never once been disappointed. I’m sure you won’t be either:) 💜💇🏻‍♀️❄️🎄<//text>

<review>I called the lady Sunday,August 17 to see if I could come in for a haircut as my regular barber wasn’t available and she told me she had other people call in and told them it would be a first come first serve basis. When I arrive there seemed to be no other clients and she proceeded to cut my hair. When I told her I wanted a zero fade she refused to do my hair that low and did a 2, or tried to. While she’s cutting my hair, a guy walks in and seems surprised to see me in the seat and she immediately rushes my haircut and starts apologizing to the man. Then another man walks in also taken back and she rushes even more. Leaving me with a god awful haircut and charging me $30 on top of the money I’m about to spend to get this fixed. I could do a better job with a butter knife and hope with bad lighting.</review>< pics>

Ky is wonderful, she has a very personable demeanor and she made the whole hair cut feel like no time at all. She listens to what you want and isn’t afraid to tell you what your hair needs based on her many years of experience. Thanks for the great cut KY!< /review>

< Review>
This woman and her business are a gem! I adore her! She made my hair look so cute! She genuinely cared and took time to make it just how I wanted it. She’s very personable. An affordable cut. One of the best haircuts I’ve had in a really long time. And she’s just so lovely. Her shop is super unique and welcoming. Definitely my new hair lady as long as I’m living in humboldt county. Happy I found her! 💖</Review>

<Date>1594883924499<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I made an appointment over the phone with this salon. However when I got there the only stylist there was in the middle of coloring another clients hair and said she would be finished soon. My daughter and I waited 40 minutes and then left.  The stylist did not seem concerned in the least that we were waiting or made any effort to hurry to get to us.   She seemed much more interested in the client that she was working on and coloring her hair.  Maybe because we only wanted a haircut and she was making more money with the other client? In any event we will not be going back!! Very unprofessional and a big waste of time.</text>< pictures>

I use to have my person at mastercuts but since they closed I've been trying to get in somewhere new and decided to give Ky's a try and am happy I did! She is very personable and makes great conversation. She listens to what you want and makes great recommendations! She did a great job on my hair and the fade was on point! Thank you Ky for working me in and doing a great job!< /text>

<text>I may not be King Arthur, but I went into K Y Designs wanting his haircut and walked out looking like a king. (See my reference photo compared to my haircut.) Ky is so sweet and amazing. She led me on a tour of her beautiful garden before cutting my hair. Like most stylists I've seen, she was hesitant at first to cut my hair as short as I like it, so she went slowly shorter and shorter until it was right. I appreciate her kindness and understanding as I've been to some places in the past where I have to practically fight to have a men's haircut. (No, a pixie cut is not the same thing.) She was a very good listener about the haircut itself and just my life in general. She's a great "hair-apist"...get it? like therapist? Haha I'm hilarious.<//text><time>1534361441405<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7GG0j6KjvumzKb77YBEcSzEBH8zq4JCF1T2yz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNqDVDWZW8-Cc69wUwwtU31pvnE448uwO0BR3A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJiW2OPixhXHO2cOmw-grcyVBRMrkrWkqiIw-z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmWtfIGk7XMrW99G95WobE4iBl3i-UhEp0Ih2n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record>

Worst haircut experience imaginable. All kinds of noticeable mistakes, not even at all. Refused to go as short as I asked, and left me with a terrible looking cut that was in no was what I was asking her to do. She pressured me to leave a review so this is your review lady. Thanks for ruining my hair now I have to go pay for another cut. When I called to let her know I was unhappy she hung up on me. I feel like I was robbed. Go anywhere but here.< /Review>

Plus she offered chocolate cake, which was delicious. I can't say no to chocolate. Too good to pass.

Thank you Ky for transforming my ideas of hair styles come to life.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>K Y's Salon was an amazing surprise. I am not from Eureka, I was just visiting friends and I needed an urgent touch up with a hairdresser so I ran a search on google and found Ky's. Luckily. Easy access and parking, very spacious salon, Ky is very very nice and an amazing professional. She is very friendly too. I LOVE my hair! I had highlights done with her and I couldn't be happier. 5 stars through and through!!!!< /Review><user>104917183090565620160< /user></record>

I was visiting eureka a few weeks ago and called in short notice to schedule a haircut. Ky was very accommodating and took me in for a haircut just before closing time. Her shop has a very unique and beautiful decor, and she did a wonderful job on my hair. Her demeanor and outgoing personality were fantastic. Thank you Ky. Hope to see you next time I'm in town.<//text>

<review>Ky, you are incredible! After being gone for nearly a decade and moving back, I had no idea where to go. My husband was incredible and called Ky to see if she was open. Never been to her before then. After coming in for a huge cut and dye job very last minute, Ky got me in and made me feel amazing. She understood what I was after and we played with several ideas to get the most amazing hair. So much so, that the next day, I sent my mom to her for a cut and dye as well. And hers looks amazing too! I know where I’ll be going next time and it will only be Ky! Thank you so much dear for the magic you worked. My husband says thank you too! He absolutely loves it and can’t wait to get back to see it in person!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>We waited to get my 8 year old daughters hair cut for 45 minutes and although I was happy to wait we didn't find out until she got in the jump seat that KY was going to charge us 40$ when it clearly says 18$+ on the website. I have never heard of a child's haircut costing 40$ w/o a shampoo or anything fancy. She's a very sweet person but that doesn't give her the right to rob people. Outrageous price period!< /Text>< resp>
{'time': 1567292940404, 'text': 'Hi Jasmine, My apologies that you had to wait for such a long time and that you were dissatisfied with the price.  My pricing is based on the individual person and what I do for them. If someone has long hair that takes more work, then the price will be higher. Regarding the wait, you are welcome to schedule a time in the future and regarding the price I can always give you the price before I do the cut so you can make a decision then if you wish to stay or go.  I wish you the best!'}</resp>

Paid $200 for a touch up on a few grey hairs . First round of color turned hair orange so had to do a second round which did not cover grey hair. Never styled my hair . Sent me away with color all over face and did a horrible job on eyebrows left with wax on face as well. Rushed me out to get to the next customer. Would never recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

<UserId.>102437951032551358527</UserId.><Text>Let me just first say that I have never written a review before in my life. But my experience here was so bad that I felt obligated to tell the public. The one and only time I've gone here was on August 12th, 2018. I then went out of the country for a year, making it difficult for me to write this review. I thought that with a year gone by I wouldn't feel so passionate about my bad haircut to still want to write the review. But here we are, a year later, still reaping the consequences of going to Ky's. My first bad interaction was when I called to make the appointment. She was very rude and blunt on the phone, telling me over and over again that she wasn't going to remind me about my visit and that I had to remember on my own. When I walked into the place she greeted me and sat me in the chair, but then another customer walked in and she made me wait until she was finished with him even though I had scheduled the visit for that specific time and he had just walked in.When I finally got into the chair she wouldn't let me tell her want I wanted to be done for my hair, just talking over me and deciding for me. For example, I asked to have bangs and she refused saying it was too much work. When we finally proceeded to the hair cut she didn't even wet my hair before starting. I had asked for just a simple 2 in. trim and ended up losing about 75% of my hair, not from length but from thickness, I have very thick hair, something I like very much about myself. She ended up taking the thinning scissors to my hair 3 times, making the first thing my family commented on when I got home was "how thin my hair was". Needless to say I won't ever go back here, and I hope you won't make the same mistake I did.<//Text><Rate>1< /Rate><pics>None</pics>< Date>

Ky has been doing my hair for the last number of years, cut, perm and hair color.  This week I went in for my perm, she did a fantastic job on my curls as usual. My curls are soft and beautiful, Ky takes a great deal of care not to damage my hair.  I came back a few days later for color and Ky said she had been thinking about me and would like to try something different with my hair color. I was resistant, my hair has basically looked the same for years...which was her point...I needed a fresh, current look. I agreed to let her do what she proposed  because I've never seen a customer leave her salon that didn't look fantastic. She was 100% right... Thank you so much Ky!<//text>< pics>

KY’s was such a wonderful experience! I went in there not knowing what I wanted because it was the first time I was getting my hair died. I told her I wanted something knew and gave her my ideas. She looked at me and instantly knew what would look beautiful and I am so happy with the results! I need with highlights in my ginger hair that looked so natural! I even get compliments till this day with it grown out because it STILL looks perfect! Her pricing is beautiful as well! This girl is just AMAZING!</review>

I love this place! Ky is fantastic, and she gives great haircuts. I take my kids here. She is quick and gentle. My son is a fidgety person when he gets his hair cut, but the finished haircut looked like he never moved.

I have been coming here off and on for about 5 years, and it always is a walk in.

There are cheaper places to get your hair cut but she is a local, and owns it her self. I like to support local businesses who provide great services.<//Review>

<Text>Worst haircut of my life!  I bought in a photo of a bob haircut and requested no layers because I am trying to grow my hair out.  Instead I got a mullet that was nothing but layers!  She hacked away at my hair using thinning shears!  One side is a full inch longer than the other side.  AVOID.< /Text></record>

The salon with confidence and personality for sure. After driving 3 hours total on a Sunday morning, I appreciate getting my hair reshaped, colored with some highlights.
I was pleased with the outcome. It looks just like it did when Regis did it the first time for half the price I paid today. Nice visit with Ky. No response when I inquired about the price in the beginning of the appointment. Quite surprised at the end.
Recommendation: Be clear about pricing and services to avoid disappointments.
Yes! I would recommend this salon to need services in a pinch on a Sunday.
Best be prepared to pay City prices.< /text>

Ky has cut my hair for several years. My hair is fine and thin and she does a very skilled job with cut and color for me. It was different for me to have someone cut my hair dry, rather than wet; but she is a very talented stylist.
Ky takes the time to get to know you, your personality and life style to help you get what you want. We are lucky to have someone with international experience right here in Eureka, and at a reasonable price. I really appreciate her outgoing personality and humor.</Text>

<Review>Ky gave our 5 yr old grandson his first "real" hair cut today. He was extremely apprehensive about the idea, but Ky immediately put him at ease. He loves his cut and will have nothing but good memories when he looks back on this day. She even slipped Papa in for a quick haircut too. We will definitely be back!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had a great experience at ky's! I went in after a crummy cut from somewhere else and she listened to what I wanted, and I left with the best hair cut I've ever had. She knew just what do with my thick hair and I left happy. Fair price, great service, and Ky is a neat lady to chat with. I will be returning for my next cut!< /review>

I have been going to Ky to get my hair cut for two years now and I couldn't be happier. I am extremely particular about the way my hair is cut and Ky always does it perfectly. She is also a really nice lady and is great fun to talk to while she cuts your hair. I have recommended her to a number of people and will continue to do so as she is the best hair cut I've ever had.</Review>

< review>
Maria was as amazing as everyone else has said she is!!  I have very thick hair and I like to keep it short.  I’m in town for 3 months for work and needed a haircut.  I’ve always had a hard time finding someone who can cut my hair well, so I was nervous to sit in front of a stranger with scissors.  Based on the many positive reviews here on Google, I decided to give Maria a try.  She listened to what I wanted and also gave me her opinion on what would look good - repeatedly telling me “you are the boss, we will do whatever you want.”  She was so sweet and pleasant to visit with and I love the way my hair ended up!!  I would definitely recommend her!!!<//review>

I'm so so happy with my new haircut!!  I showed Ky a couple of pintrest pictures of what I wanted and she knew right away what my style was.  She is fast and efficient without rushing through the job.  Even more, she was super friendly and inviting!  She sent me home with more Asian pears than I could carry from her trees out back.  I will absolutely be coming back in the future!  Thanks for the great experience, Ky!</review>

As a resident of Eureka  (Humboldt co) I've had to accept a laid back, disconnected attitude shown toward patrons. Few grasp the importance of customer service and when I see someone making an effort to do good work I take notice.
Ky O of ky's hair design stands head and shoulders above those in her field. With 40+ yrs experience you can count on her abilities. You may know what you want but she'll show you what you really need. Ky has styled my whole families hair for many years. Ky always makes you feel welcome, she remembers your name and even those of your family.
Thank you Ky for the amazing work you do and your heart felt service to my family and our community. Jim Osborn</Text>

<review>Today I went in for my first haircut in this area (I am from New York and was concerned that the quality of haircut here may not be what I was hoping for).  I was as WRONG as could be.
KY is one of the sweetest women I've had the pleasure of meeting in Humboldt.  She took her time and gave me a very high quality cut despite my mess of a head upon arrival.  I had a poor and vague description of what I was looking for, and KY was able to deliver / provide me with the best haircut I've ever received.
Thank you so much KY for your genuine love and passion for cutting hair.  It is not just a job!  And for being such a sweet, lovely and lively woman to talk to during the process.

I called in about an hour prior and she was happy to take me. She is very kind, and keeps a pleasant conversation while cutting. I wasn't really sure what I wanted, and she was more than happy to work with me as she cut. My girlfriend really liked my hair cut.
I will definitely come back here in a few months.</review>

Absolutely fabulous woman, wonderful artist, my brother recommended her to me (and he's fussy about his hair so I KNEW she had to be good) but I came in, asked for a bob cut because that's what I'm used to. She didn't think it was a good idea, but let me know if that was what I wanted she'd do it. I let her work her magic, and it was one of the best decisions I'd ever made. Ky I hope you can see this! I'm so grateful! Hope to see you soon with my brother ;3 So people, just trust this woman. She knows what she's doing.</text>

Over priced. I do not recommend getting hair colored there I left so upset didint do what I asked for at all. She didint blend the colors together she just left them  on top of that I didint want layer and she did it anyway and cut more than I wanted Very unsatisfied tried charging me $250 for messing up my hair when she originally said $230!!!! She called the police when I said I would offer $150 for the time she put in even tho I was upset and she accepted it than wanting more telling the police I wouldn't pay anything... she ended up getting $180 and she had the check in her hand. Even tho I’ve had previous good experiences with ky this left me never wanting to go back all she wants is your money even when she made a mistake! I realized that my has no humility she can’t own her own mistakes.<//Review>

This was my first choice and my first hair cut in the area. I'm SO happy with how it turned out. I went in not really knowing what I wanted, maybe just a trim, so instead I said "layers," and she went to work! I LOVE the cut! She knows what she's doing. She is so kind, friendly and professional. I will definitely be going back!<//Text>

<text>. Beware of being ripped off. Look at the other low reviews for the truth!!!  My mother-in-law went to get her hair trimmed. She has very short thin hair. Not much to cut. She was charged $65 for a trim. Not even a inch of hair was cut off. On the website they put woman’s hair priced at $35-65+. Why would a trim cost 65. She didn’t wash her hair or blow dry it. Also realized after looking at the website prices, she has been over charging for the mens haircut as well. Website states $25+. She’s been charging 40. I guess the + sign is there Incase she wants to add extra money to her pockets. We tried to have her correct this but made false claims of proving extra survives like waxing to my mother-in-law. I felt her face and eyebrows. She was not waxed! Very disappointed. I personally have never spent that much on a trim. Or even at a nice salon that actually washes and styles your hair. Still didn’t cost $65. Make sure she’s very clear about what she plans on charging people that day.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Ky has given me the most professional, quality haircut I've had since moving to this area.  She obviously knows hair and does a great job. There are other places with cheaper cuts, but I'm willing to pay a little extra for the quality and reliable results I get every time I go in.<//Review>

<review>She's really nice and knows how to cut hair.
However I didn't have that great of an experience with her - and it's my own fault, really. I'm way too nice and polite and I don't speak up much.
I just graduated college and am looking for a job so I have no cash, my hair was looking mangy, and since I've had nothing but bad experiences with salons I thought I would give Ky a try since all of the other reviews were so good.
I went in and asked for a simple trim because I'm trying to grow my hair out and because I didn't want to spend that much.
She convinces me that after my bad experiences I was going to have a good one with her. She starts cutting my hair and talks up a more elaborate cut and I don't know what to do besides let her. She gives me a decent hair cut. It doesn't look that bad. It's not what I came in for but- SHE CHARGED ME $60. (And I still tipped her because I have no idea how to stand up for myself and I hate people who make scenes like that.) I was fighting back tears paying her. I didn't say anything but thank you.
I lied to her and said I would return to her business and that I would leave a good review. Yep. Ugh.

Then I get home and no one noticed I had even got my haircut. Over $60 and no one noticed. It's been almost a week now and I'm still sad about the whole experience.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Fantastic !!  What a wonderful experience .....  I've known Ky for about 3 1/2  years, and finally was able to get a haircut by her.  What a treat !  We were able to visit and at the same time Ky gave me an amazing Haircut ...  In fact it was more than a haircut .....  it was '' Haircut & Style ''
My daughter is also in the Haircut & Style industry [ she is in Texas ] and after Ky's Haircut, I text my daughter a picture .....  her reply was
'' Yay finally a good one ''  I am so happy with my new Haircut / Style I told Ky '' You have a new client "
Such a pleasant change from the regular barber shops, they give you a quick buzz, collect the money, then hollar Next.

First of all, I wish I could rate ZERO stars!!! DO NOT GO THERE!!! I found this place on Google after moving here a few months ago and went because she has descent reviews and being a small business owner I thought she wouldn't charge outrageous prices like larger salons, WRONG!!! When I called to make my appointment I explained how light blonde my hair is and how particular i was about getting the right color. I told her exactly what my hair dresser of 12 yrs uses and she told me not to worry that she has 41yrs experience and would have no problem matching my color. While she was cutting my hair she explained the price to be about $170 total. I explained to her that was a bit pricey since I'm used to getting this done for $65. Now i realize I'm not in Oklahoma anymore, but even in Napa I only paid $105. So we negotiated down to $150. SHE TURNED MY HAIR SILVER!!! Then spent an hr putting toners on it. She had to stop because she was damaging my hair. When I asked when I was coming back to fix it, she said she was not because it was a pretty color and there was nothing wrong with it. Then she proceeds to tell me that I agreed to the color before we started. She showed my 3 different color swatches and said she would use "a little of this one and that one and a drop of that color". How was I supposed to know that meant silver??? She then proceeds to charge me $150 for the wrong color and says that she didn't charge me for the toner. HOW GRACIOUS OF YOU!!! You didn't charge me for the product you had to use because you messed up my hair!!! And she REFUSES to fix it. AND tells me I can come back in 3 months for my touch up and she'll try to get it right next time. NEXT TIME??? No thanks!!! I know this post is lengthy but please DO NOT TRUST THIS WOMAN AND PASS IT ON TO ANYONE IN EUREKA LOOKING FOR A SALON TO GO TO.<//Text>

Great experience. She listened to what I wanted, did it quickly and expertly, and had a reasonable price. I've only gone to a few other places for hair cuts in Humboldt, and Ky's is by far the best I've gone to.<//text>

I had a previous color experience that came out AWFUL, not even close. She took her time, and gave me exactly what I wanted! She also gave me a great cut. I'm extremely happy with the results. Never going anywhere else in Eureka!</review>

<name>Natural Green< /name><review>I'm disappointed to have to write this review. I tried to avoid it by trying to work things out with Ky, but she just starts yelling at me and hangs up the phone. You can't have an intelligent conversation with her because she gets all crazy and freaks out. I'm pissed that I wasted my time and money on a haircut that was amateur quality. Ky is a total rip-off. She claims to have 40 years of experience but she doesn't know how to handle a scissor correctly. BTW, that doesn't really surprise me because she's not the first so-called professional hairstylist in the area who doesn't even know how to handle their scissors correctly. In fact, she's at least the third one that I've seen of such low professional aptitude.
Ky relies heavily on using shaving shears because she has no real hair-cutting skill. Ky also doesn't take direction very well. I showed up with a photo of a basic men's hairstyle. She was unable to give me the cut I requested. Instead, she just trimmed the style I already had, which I was asking her to change.She refused to refund my money when I showed her how poor of a job she did on my hair. She began accusing me of not wanting to pay for my haircut. I would be more than happy to pay for the haircut I'm asking for. When you say you can do something that you can't, you don't deserve to be paid. At least not the full amount, and that's what we could have compromised upon. Unfortunately, Ky was hostile, rude and unprofessional. That is an honest critique of her professional conduct.
I seriously wouldn't recommend her as a stylist because she does a total rush-job, over-charges at $28.00 for a men's cut, then you don't even get what you asked for. How does she deserve any more than 1 star?? She deserves 0.5 stars really. I think she's a complete idiot because this could have been worked out peacefully but Ky absolutely refused to cooperate. She's right, I'm wrong, that's it.  It's too bad, but this is just another untrained, unskilled loser just trying to fake it as she wings her way through the day telling people she has experience that she doesn't. It's a sad and pathetic way to make your money, but there are all kinds of low-life scum in our community and Ky is just another lying, thieving, dishonorable swindler among us.<//review><response>{'time': 1516150909070, 'text': 'Thank you Natural, kyo'}</response>< pics>

<review>I've been seeing Ky for several years to get my hair cut, and couldn't be happier.  I used to go to the local mall - and get charged more - for generally poor haircuts.  Further, there was so much turn over that there wasn't any consistency.

With Ky, I know I will be getting the same, consistent, excellent haircut and personal attention every time.

Appointment times are honored...check
Friendly service...check
Reasonable price...check
Super-convenient hours...check
Attention to detail...check

Also, she is kid-friendly.  My kids used to hate getting their hair cut, but since I started taking them to see Ky, they love it!

I don't even tell her how I want my hair cut anymore...I just sit down in the chair and she knows what to do.  Thanks, Ky!< /review>< pictures>

I got a haircut from Ky 2 days ago and have never been more satisfied with a haircut. She listened to me before cutting and made sure she knew exactly what I wanted before she started. She was very funny made sitting in a barber chair actually enjoyable. It's also a plus that my girlfriend really likes my haircut, and in the end, that's all that really matters.</Text>

Kys hair designs is the only place i go to in eureka, every time i show up she remembers my face and treats me as a friend.

Went here about about a month ago. I have very thick hair down to my mid back. She quoted me $60 I loved my layers she gave me. You can tell she has experience. She's also very pleasant. When she were done she said the total was $65. She charged me an extra $5 for a dime size squeeze of moisturizer she put on my hair that I didn't ask for. It's only $5 but I thought it was weird. I just took it out of her tip. I left her 15 dollars instead of 20. Sad because I really liked my hair and I had planned on getting highlights here, but I don't like what she did that with that upcharge. Not even to mention my hair was still dry. On the website it says haircut and style and my hair was not styled and I had to go home and style it. $65 for layers without a wash. I won't return here. High end prices but the salon didn't even have air conditioning. I was sweating the whole time. Not high end.</Text>

I've been going to Ky's for over 2 years, and in that time I have never regretted a single cut. She always works with the style I request and goes the extra mile when it comes to making me look good. When it comes to my hair there is only one person I trust and that's Ky's hair salon.<//review>

<Text>Such a sweey lady! I needed a cut desperately and she agreed to stay and cut my hair at 5pm. I had a nail appt that ran late and she was totally willing to work with me and stayed even later to accommodate me. She was super friendly and did a great job I told her what I was looking for and she gave it a great edgy look. Will definitely go back!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This place is a scam. As soon as I sat down she was pressuring me to get on my phone and write a review for her as well as vote for her daily for best salon and best stylist-which she is far from! I could have cut my hair better than she did with a pair of scissors in my bathroom. In fact I had to immediately go and get it fixed. I was very unhappy and honestly felt like I had been conned since she charged me such a high price ($50)! I came in with messy hair that was dirty and had been in a bun all day, she didn't wash or use any product, she just started chopping away. It was so crooked. This place is aweful and if you don't want to get two haircuts in one day like I did, I highly recommend NEVER going here!!!<//Review>

< Review>
K Y's hair design is one of the best places to get your haircut in the 707 area. She listens to exactly what you want and provides a very satisfying haircut. Anyone who is looking for a good haircut at a fair price should check out KY's Hair Designs. 10/10, would recommend to other college kids as well!< /Review>

So I had been trying to find a salon in Arcata for the past three days. I don't normally get my hair cut, but just was in need of a trim. Little did I know, most of these places either do not have receptionists or simply do not answer the phone (these were all places that accepted walk-ins, as well as appointments) K Y's was different. She answered the phone, so my husband and I drove to Eureka. When we walked in the building itself was already worth paying a few bucks. KY said hello, was very friendly, and said she'd be with us in a minute, as she had two other clients (one wrapping up and one getting a wash). It was no problem as I really just appreciated that she answered the phone. We then sat and listened to her aggressively upsell her client being washed, and tell her client who was waiting to pay, how absolutely great her hair looked and how good of a job she did.

After 20 minutes or so she was ready for me. I came and sat down and she asked what I wanted. I told her I'm trying to grow my hair out (it's a little longer than shoulder length and thick and curly) and she just tried to sell me a bottle of conditioner. I again told her I just needed a trim, and she said it will be around $60 and the package would be cheaper. I said that the package was fine (I couldn't quite tell, but it seemed like a wash and cut package) I told her I didn't really mind how much I spent as I normally don't do this, and it is my birthday.. But then she proceeded to dry cut my hair and 15 minutes later we were finished. OH! When she brushed out my hair, she did use a giant "permanent wave" comb- which I had never seen before and was a no-snag/no-pull blessing. She had more of these and sold me one. That was great.

I guess I'm just leaving this review because I feel ripped off after paying $72.

The experience itself was almost worth the money- but I still have crazy split ends but I also came up on that comb.< /review>< pics>

<Review>This was the third time I had my hair done by ky. I had very blonde hair and had been growing my hair out for months. I went in for a highlight on my major grown out roots. Ky knew my hair was fragile and that was a big concern of mine. I just wanted the roots done. She took the highlight all the way to the bottom of my already processed hair and melted off half my already thin hair. It is a night mare. I don’t even feel like I can go out in the wind I am so traumatized. Why would a professional put bleach on already blonde processed hair when I just wanted my roots highlited. Then, as all my hair is mushing off, she tells me to stop combing my hair, she did not want me to see all the damage. Then she charged me full price, knowing she ruined my hair. She is a money grubbing, un careful, senseless woman. Just look at her hair next time you think about letting her bleach or color yours. She should of had the decency to not charge me two hundred dollars. I hate her for that. Save your money. Anyone could do a better job for half that amount. May karma find you . I would love to see you in a dark ally and cut all your hair off.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<username>HumboldtKounty</username><review>KY has a nice touch on hair style, she always does a great job and treats me very pleasantly. I have gone to alot of different barbers and salons in eureka, fortuna area and my favorite place is KY's. She does a great job blending and fading my hair always look pristine when I leave. She even offered me food I would of accepted but was going out for lunch right after my hair cut she is very nice and I would highly recommend her.<//review>< Date>

<user_name>G G</user_name><time>1376075790405<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This review is for a highlights/lowlights I got done over a year ago, and that's what makes it legit - they look really good even after growing out. I received compliments when I first got them, and people still say my hair color looks good.

Since it was the first coloring at all I've ever done, I was apprehensive, but they turned out perfect - not too bright, not too subtle, a challenge for really dark hair. The right amount- not too many that I might as well change my entire hair color, and not so few that one could count the strands colored.

Ky was friendly and offered suggestions, but she sought affirmation, not a shrug or an 'ok,' so I felt like she was actually concerned with my opinion (gasp, right?) regarding my own hair.

Anyway, I know there are a few bad reviews out there, as is wont to happen for any business, but I'm happy with Ky's work from Feb 2012.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1436405204547, 'text': 'Thank you so much Giovanna!'}<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Ky is a liar and a thief.  She is a miserable disgrace to our community as well as to herself and her own family. I hope she goes out of business.
She will lie right to your face and tell you she can do a job that she can't just to get the cash. Then, a week or so later, when you realize how bad of a job she did, she refuses to return your money and calls the police to claim you're harassing her.  This is the same tactic I've seen in several other hair salons in the area.  They all suck. They're all a bunch of low-class, untrained, unskilled idiots who can't get a job doing anything else.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I went to Ky's hair design salon back in December 2014 to get my hair colored. I have black hair, and wanted a golden blonde color. After i told her and showed her lots of pictures of what i wanted, she expressed confidence that she could do it. She kept priding about herself and that she has done this for years. I only did the top half of my hair. Basically had chunky blonde highlights added. While this was happening, she had some men walk in for hair cuts. She had them wait while she finished coloring my hair because she was the only worker. I had felt like she rushed to finish me so she could do her walk-ins. When she finished with the highlights i had expected her to put a hair cap on me, but instead she put a plastic walmart bag on my head. Which i thought was really strange. While i waited under the heater for my hair, she cut about 2 mens hair. After her salon was empty, she returned to me to wash my hair. I also had a deep condition. Halfway thru blow drying my hair, she turned off the blow dryer and said we were done (note that there was more walk-ins waiting for hair cuts). When I went to the counter to pay her, i asked what kind of payment she accepted. She then said, "oh u don't have cash?". I did have enough cash on me, but i just wanted to ask if she accepts credit/debit. I ended up paying in cash and left with my hair damp. I was confused if my hair was supposed to be damped and for it to air dry the rest due to the deep condition? Still don't know, but i felt like she was just rushing so she could get to her walk-in customers and don't lose money from them because she did have to send off 1 customer. When I got home and dried my hair, i was not pleased with the outcome. Being the shy person that i am, i called another hair salon to try and make my hair look nicer. They had asked me to go back to Ky because she did the work so she should be the one to fix it. So I called her regarding not being pleased with the outcome and i set up another appointment to go in. At my 2nd visit, i told her that the outcome of my hair just didn't look good, so she recommended i highlight the bottom half of my hair to match the top. So i agreed. She did not end up giving me any discount and just charged me full price.

Overall, if u just want a simple haircut i think she can get the job done. If u want colored hair, as much as she prides herself in her work, she can't walk the talk as the results did not show. She did not make me feel important and top priority (being her ONLY scheduled appointment for the day).

I was a bit disappointed with the overall experience and outcome of my hair. I ended up having a family member redo my hair. Everything i said above is based on my experience and opinion.< /Text><GmapID>0x54d3ffd2e125cde7:0xfc8a358f3d305017< /GmapID><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>First time here, last time trusting anybody with my hair.  I had been dying my hair dark brown/almost black for 2 years and wanted to go back to my natural ash blonde color.  I am aware this takes multiple sessions to lighten and completely get rid of the previous hair dye and not completely destroy my hair from the chemicals.  I picked out a color and thought I made it clear that I was okay with it taking multiple sessions but I wanted to lighten my hair.  Instead I got my black hair with bleach blonde streaks in it.  I have seen multiple people go from dyed black hair to blonde and their hair looked nothing like mine. I was charged $220 dollars for maybe 6 streaks of bleach blonde highlights that looked horrible mixed in with my same black hair.  I immediately went home and re-dyed my hair to cover the streaks.  I knew it might look a little off until I could complete the sessions but this was more than embarrassing. Even the cashier for my box hair dye from CVS asked how I could have messed up my hair so badly.  I have no problem staying and asking for my hair to be fixed, but I had already been in the salon close to 3 hours and didn't feel any need to waste more time of my only day off in the week.  Maybe I would return and give it another chance, but after seeing the complete lack of lightening save a few horrible bleached strands, I know I can't afford $220+ every visit for no results.<//text>< time>

She was completely satisfied when she left my salon. I cannot in good conscious give a full refund to a satisfied customer.The transaction was clear and satisfactory after I worked on her hair. She stated she liked her hair and it was apparent later that you guys did not have the means to pay. I protect myself and my family and by doing so I can no longer serve you or your daughter. I do wish you the best on your journey. By the way "absolute worst place to go" means nothing if you cannot say why.'}< /Response><pics>None</pics>< Date>

Does not listen, she does whatever she wants. Twice I have asked for a brown color. She dyed it red! Then, she calls me over and over asking for favors- were not even friends! I'll never go back, and watch out for this one.< /text>

Worst experience! Easily offended technician can't have a basic discussion about why they'd changed the over-the-phone quote to add tax, although I was still willing to pay it! And for some reason, me asking questions to make sure what parts of broken glass area they would clean up with the replacement is wrong. Terrible and childish service.< /text>

<Resp>{'time': 1618011617847, 'text': "Hello Mr. Mumtaz we're sorry that you feel your experience was the worst.  Our company prides itself on being professional and convenient for both our customers and our technicians so we will gladly answer questions but our technicians are not allowed to argue or haggle with customers per company policy. Unfortunately California State has a mandatory sales tax that we by law have to collect, that can be frustrating to customers when it adds to the price but is unavoidable. With regards to vacuuming your vehicle we gladly offer this service as a courtesy but because we have customers scheduled throughout the day we can only vacuum as much of your car as time allows. That being said we hope you can find a company that better suits your needs.\n\nRegards\nCGS customer service"}< /Resp></record>

Any future people considering this company should definitely do it. The customer service was nice and friendly. The worker showed up at the given estimated time and was more than happy to perform the replacement on my windshield. It took him 30 minutes to completely install my windshield. Very highly recommended and great impression on my thoughts of the company!</text>

I had a great experience with then. Sean did an awesome job and all in no time at all. The price was perfect for my budget and the environment was laid back and comfortable. I'll definitely be recommending them to all my friends and family.<//Review>

<text>Had a busted window from only God knows what. Looked like a bowling ball fell from the sky and hit my window. Called CGS on Thursday they had the windshield glass ready to go on Friday morning. The replacement took less then and hour. Extremely happy with the prompt service and the quality of the work completed. Would definitely recommend.</text><GmapID>0x809b535176dde8e3:0x8dca9576cf7e5a5c<//GmapID><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Had great service here for my windshield replacement.  It cost less than half of what I was quoted by Safelite!  Please support this business.  It's a guy and his shop, truly a local business.  Don't pay more than double to a mega corporation! Come here, support local business and a local family, and get great customer service.</review>

Sean was very accommodating and professional. I had both of my car's windshields replaced, the job was done flawlessly. If you need it done right and for a screaming deal call CGS Auto Glass. He will definitely be getting my future business along with my recommendations to family and friends.</review>

I think it is awesome that they come to YOU! The price was unbeatable and I feel they did a quality job. No messes left, very polite and professional. They offer military discounts as well, which we appreciate!< /text>< Pictures>

This is the best place to get an honest affordable quote.  The serviceman showed up on time and completed the work quickly and efficiently with a smile.  He even went the extra mile and offered to pop out a couple of dents on my teenager's vehicle for free!  I will definitely be using this exceptional local company again for all of my future needs!<//review>

The price was unbeatable. He explained to me the process as he went along and I felt very confident in his work. Sean was very personable and knew what he was doing! This will be my go to glass company as well as my recommendation to friends and family.</review>

CGS promptly answered my call for a quote and provided a far better price than the car dealership. The technician was professional, efficient, and friendly. He worked around a sensor on the windshield with ease. The replacement was done at my work. The availability of scheduling the work was fast. He also offered us a newer trim to replace our faded trim. The new trim looks much better. The next time that I need glass work I will call CGS.<//review>

We called in this morning to see if we could get a chip in the windshield fixed. They yold us to come right over and they would get it taken care of. It took about 30 minutes and we were on our way. They were super nice and the prices are very reasonable! We will definitely be using them for all of our windshield repairs. I highly recommend them.</review>

Do yourself a favor and give this business a chance. I had a mobile appointment scheduled on a day that the weather turned out to be iffy. Shawn called and let me know if it was raining he would have to reschedule then gave me options. He could come out and try that day with the possibility of being rained out or I could reschedule. I threw him another option of meeting him at his shop so he could do it inside if the weather soured. He accommodated my schedule and provided same day service. The estimate was the best price in the area and the glass is a perfect replacement piece. I cant forget the guarantee, lifetime on the installation. Any issues and just bring it back and he will fix it. That is as good as it gets. I will recommend CGS to anyone and he has all my business.< /review>

Quit searching for the best, because you have found them right here! Sean provided the highest quality of service in a timely manner. He was very informative and made sure my questions were answered. You can TRUST this small business to take care of your vehicle the way you want and deserve. Honestly, if you are looking for a better deal, you won't find one. I searched around for the best deal and found it. So if you are needing window replacement or repair, have windows to be tinted, or foggy headlights, breathe easy knowing you are in good hands. Thank you CGS for the wonderful care! God Bless!< /Text>

<Text>CGS is an amazing & professional company. I got called into work and had to re-schedule last minute; Sean was incredibly understanding and flexible. My install was super quick and Sean took the time to walk me through everything he was doing. My spouse and I always try to support local business- they've earned a lifetime customer!<//Text>< Date>

When I got a chip on my Camaro, I google searched glass companies in Yuba City and I saw all the positive reviews that Contract Glass had, so I called them and booked an appointment. They had a service tech out to my house the same day! He explained the process and was patient with my questions, when he was done it looked perfect.
I would recommend Contract Glass to anybody. They'll take care of you.
I really appreciate the new windshield.
Thank You, Contract Glass.
Sincerely, Oliver Smith.< /Review>

<review>I never had my glass broken so I didn't know where to go. I have a new 2017 4Runner so I wanted oem parts. Toyota Dealership quoted me    $450 for parts and labor.

I saw this place had good reviews, so I tried them. They quoted me $160. When I got there, I met the owner Sean, he saw I was military and slapped a big discount on me to take care of me. I really loved how it came out and how careful he was. The glass was oem quality. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.
Happy customer!< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
When my windshield fell victim to a rock on the freeway, I found C. G. S. via a Google search and called based on the previous testimonials. Sean gave me a competitive, professional estimate over the phone and scheduled an appointment to fix it at my location the next day. This service was super helpful since was during my busy season at work and it is next to impossible to find time to leave the office. At the appointment Sean was quick and personable, the installation looked clean and perfect and he even threw in a few bonuses. Highly recommend.<//Review>

Shawn has become my go to guy for glass repair on all of Hilbers fleet vehicles.  He always responds quickly and leaves the vehicle spotless.  He is so stream lined all I have to do is text him the make, model and year of a vehicle and he comes to our office and replaces it right in the parking lot.  I don't think it could be any easier!< /review>

Had my windshield replaced here. Great choice: 1) Schedule appointment, 2) Bring in, 3) 45 minutes later = new windshield professionally installed at best price in town! Don't let the residential area scare you away. This guy is a hidden jewel!<//Review>

<review>Fantastic service.

I wanted to wait a few weeks after my windshield was replaced, before I wrote this review.  Sean came out and replaced the windshield on my Mercedes, and he did an amazing job.    Sean kept in communication with me on his arrival time, he cleaned up the inside of the car, and went what I thought was above and beyond what other Windshield replacement companies do when installing windshields (sealing any exposed metal under the windshield so that it would not rust, etc.).

I asked if I could watch what he was doing, and he was very pleasant about explaing everything he was doing as he did it.

I put my car under a sprinkler in my yard to test for leaks, and left it there while watering the yard.  No leaks.   Good quality glass, good workmanship - and the best part, they were roughly 30% less expensive than any other company I received a quote from.

Will definitely use them again - and will recommend them to anyone looking for auto glass.</review><time>1435700555325<//time>< resp>

I contact CGS  after 1 pm on a Monday and he gave me a quote along with scheduling me for the following afternoon. Not only were they the best price but they were the fastest to provide service. Shaun came out to me and was done within 45 minutes. I called two other local glass service places and one never called back, the other was way over priced. Call them first for a quote, you won't regret it. Thank you Shaun.<//Review>

<Text>I live in Texas and had to arrange for a windshield replacement in my daughters car near C.G.S Auto Glass in Yuba City, CA. The experience was exceptional in all regards. C.G.S was easy to work with, and the service was courteous, thorough,  professional, and quick. Their prices were extremely reasonable, and they made it easy to handle the payment from an out of state source. By the way, did I mention that it also included a mobile service which was performed right on schedule.
In case you are wondering why such a glowing recommendation for C.G.S, well for me the reason is simple, and it is this, the good folks at C.G.S made it incredibly easy for me to help my daughter, from a distance, and who by the way was hurting over the recent loss of her husband, finish getting her car made safe for the road with a badly needed new windshield. In addition, throughout the process, they were sensitive to her needs and their technician carefully explained the process to her when he arrived at her residence to do the windshield replacement. She telephoned me immediately after the windshield was installed and told me how much she appreciated that care. As a customer you hope that the business you select for the needed work will of course do a good job, but I never expected the incredible service and care that I got with C.G.S. Thank you C.G.S for your great service and your help.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1526527173468, 'text': 'Thank you Reg, were honored to be able to help in such a hard time.

Had someone break into my car (smashing in the front passenger door window) on Saturday night and I called CGS, as well as many other glass companies, and they quoted me $50 cheaper than the rest. James kept in touch with me when he was picking the glass up and when he was on his way. He met me on time at my apartment complex and began working. James explained everything he was doing and why he was doing it, good thing because I had never seen anyone take a car door apart and was a bit worry about how it would go back together (haha). James was very friendly and took his time doing an amazing job! Even vacuumed out the inside (while saving some earrings :)). I would recommend CGS to any and everyone that I come into contact with that is looking for an auto glass service!

THANK YOU JAMES!!!< /review>

<Review>I highly recommend CGS for windshield repairs as it provides top quality and honest service at an incredible price.  As a longtime resident of the Y-S area, there are many windshield repair shops to choose from, but finding the right one can be challenging.  I'm an owner of a '05 Tundra truck that had an annoying rattle and whistle when driving at high speed.  I soon figured out it was likely the seal around the windshield causing this problem and called CGS for an estimate.  My call was determined by the positive reviews posted online.  Sean quoted the price of $20-$80 over the phone and I immediately took my truck over for him to look at it.  Sean knew exactly the problem and repaired it on the spot for the low cost of $20.  I was impressed with Sean's friendliness and knowledgeable skills.  He has worked at various trade businesses before opening his own local shop.  Without a doubt, I would return to CGS for any windshield repair jobs and would highly recommend you meet Sean as he provides top quality and honest service.  Thanks again, Sean!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< user>

They have a great little restaurant counter with burgers, sandwiches, pot pies and milks shakes. They also have a cute grocery store with a wide variety of interesting things including beer, wines, pies, nuts, snacks, and some prepared foods. We always make sure to stop by on our travels via I-80</text>< pictures>

<Review>This is an amazing store with lots and lots of choices. You can get pre-packaged marinated meat and poultry cuts, season fruit from local farms, groceries, teas, coffee, condiments, flours, all in surprising variety, and more. The choice of pies is ridiculous - 3 sizes (counting one-piece), over a dozen of sweet fillings, chicken pot pies, freshly baked to go, frozen to bake at home, freshly baked muffins, what not. Very friendly staff!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ7XIqYnG0Kt3rJtdQT9rxauidBYABli3IKgcE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD9onpINZ1GEgPM3o3TIG5T-qRn6HW-8w5XXd6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6z0XMJpfZ8BawXMdvYhNH93iBFPrmhQbM1LaH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4mlnpkYbC6KWCXwaHWYD491r4waYWFef_t3tG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_1vLZNimiaFzBcAqcog4IvEK1onGZKP7QbAk7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp31nxD15_5636jL1aSaw9aOrAZAJxzETCgdrM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMro1olTLXjCAiU2huoqVfoxBs_mq-QqEl4LSZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<user_name>Seth Wessitsh</user_name><Text>I had a reasonably tasty bacon jalapeno cheeseburger with curly fries.  The curly fries were seasoned about the same you get everywhere else so they were what I expected.  The burger was good but I ordered mushrooms with it online and they forgot them.  I would have given 4 stars but for that.<//Text><rate>3<//rate>< Pics>

First of all, Ikeda's is awesome!  The burgers are amongst my top three ever.  I've been coming to Ikeda's for 30+ years.  It's a must stop driving from Reno to CA. Unfortunately, certain areas have slowly gotten worse.  Where's my big burger and fries combo?  Why has the milkshake choices been limited?  Milkshakes used to be available in any fruit available in the market.  Please, bring these things back.< /review>

I genuinely like Ikedas, but the service is so slow and the $30 crab sandwich is an absolute rip off. East Coasters are gasping at this atrocity (see photo).</Review>

<text>Amazing food in the Cafe and some great jams and hot sauces in the market. Highly recommend this stop on any road trip. The tri-tip sandwiche and chicken pot pie are especially delicious!< /text>< Pics>

The food is a little pricey but it is delicious and the servings are generous! I came here to try their world famous pies but none of the reviews I read recommended any in particular. I tried the triple berry due to a staff recommendation and was not a fan at all. I’m not a huge berry pie person in general so that’s probably why. I did try the Dutch apple pie and if you like apple pies- you’ll love this one! Not sure if they have the best pies in the world but they are up there!<//Review>< pics>

Me and my wife stopped here on our way home from Soda Springs. When going into these little family owned stores I always look for honey and there is probably the best I've ever purchased. Looked to the left and saw they make burger's.. This AINT regular burger's, these burger's were made by god himself. Top 5 burger places in CA for sure.<//text>

<Review>I recently moved to Auburn and finally made it over to Ikeda's after all of the rave reviews. I have to say that I was less than impressed with the food and it is extremely overpriced. My burger was mediocre and my husband ordered a specialty burger that was so messy that he had to take off half of the toppings just to get through it. The onion rings didn't taste fresh, but like frozen onion rings. The fries were somewhat soggy. Paying $35 for lunch for 2 seemed like a huge waste. I won't be returning.

The store itself is cute and packs a lot of fun snacks, pies, cheese and meats. May stop here for that, but not the food.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>A great place to stop when travelling between the Bay area and Tahoe. Part restaurant, part pie shop, and part market. The restaurant serves burgers, sandwiches, and milkshakes - and warm slices of pie. In the adjacent market, you can buy locally grown produce and fruit, whole pies, and sweets.</Text>< Resp>

<text>The long time family favorite still shines like a jewel on this stretch of interstate 80! For us, it's halfway there or home, and worth a stop both ways. For tasty burgers or pot pies, fresh produce or beverages...a food stop and marketplace with yummy options. And always always always gotta select one of the many amazing pies.</text><user_id>102067852331930587594</user_id>< Pictures>

Wonderful fresh food market. Charming grill/restaurant where everything is delicious AND amazing pie of every flavor. (They will heat your piece of pie if you ask!)  A must place to visit.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Don't just go for the remaining pies! Their lettuce and produce is often times some of the best I have ever seen! And nothing better than being able to buy already marinated delicious variety of meats to throw on the grill if you're heading for Truckee! The people are always super friendly and I'm always in and out so quickly that it is safer to be here than a big Raley's or Safeway especially during covid! Thank you to Ikeda for always remaining top notch!<//text>< pics>

A delicious break after coming out from backpacking. Good burgers, and you'd better mean it when you order French fries! Must have been 3 Idaho's worth! Chocolate shakes for the post hike craving, and clean accesible bathrooms to freshen up. Oh yes!</review>

<text>A great place to grab a burger, fries and pie on the way to or from Tahoe.  Some of their burgers are enough for two,  double patties back to back on a roll so share.

<Text>"Nice picture, Jason.  A demolished piece of pie?  Really?"

Yeah.  Meant to take more and better photos, but after a fun day swimming at the North Fork of the American River, we were hungry, and I was only reminded to take pictures at this point.

In a way this is very representative of Ikeda's.  The food is so good, it will be gone before you know it.

Pictured is a slice (mostly) of Triple Berry Pie.  Almost as excellent as either of their Razzleberry options (cobbler or pie, both magnificent).

You have to try the Marionberry shake.  And then everyone you know must try it.

Other musts:

*Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Holy heck.

*Ikeda's Gourmet Wagyu Burger.  Be hungry

*the Patty Melt.  No, really, the Patty Melt.

*Finally, the Teriyaki burger has no pineapple, but uses caramelized onions instead.  It's so sweet and tasty that I probably had it three times before I realized it.

This is one of my must-stops returning to Reno from any California trip.

Did I mention the farm fresh produce and collection of homemade sauces?

There are so many reasons to love Ikeda's.

Last but not least:  they are 45 seconds off the freeway (60 if you're stuck at the light), and have plenty of parking.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgCGy1AdeGzV6HSVAcauao9rSBwDfLrTPClv4X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<Text>I love coming here and ordering the western burger, which is really just 2 burgers disguised as 1. There are amazing pies/cobblers (albeit a little pricey), and a wonderful fresh produce selection in the attached market. It's always worth stopping if you're heading up to tahoe, or coming back from a weekend backpacking trip.</Text>< Pics>

Small shop & restaurant with a plethora of fruit & a veggie focus. Things are very fresh & there's an area where you can taste some of their products. Be aware it is quite pricey. For me it was a place I would only go to once just to satisfy my curiosity as it is a bit of the way.<//Text>

Banana pie was creamy and giod, perfect with coffee. Coffee Shakes were not thick enough. Wagyu burger at $15 was a dissapointment, thin meat, not juicy and they forgot to put my grill onions that I paid extra. They also forgot to give me my onion rings, too much panko batter. Manager apologize and threw in a slice of pie, great service. The beef steak pie was too salty. Chicken pot pie was great, buy 5 get 6 free. The double burger was ok, I wished thefe were sauced.<//text>

I can't say enough about this place it's the most best place to go and buy pies or quick snack to eat the people are sweet and nice very helpful they will help you with ideas great place to buy a last-minute gift if you like wine I always stop and get the coconut cream pie and it is very good if you don't like cooking and cream there's lemon meringue apple pie Dutch during the season that pumpkin sweet potato pie they have cherry pie it's a laid-back place small tiny like a grocery store in a way walking around is really mellow nobody pressures restaurant next door is awesome to I can go on and on and on if you're going towards Sacramento or coming back from California that is a place to stop at all times I stop coming and going😍😍😍< /review>

Best pie i have ever had in my life!!! I am a picky eater of small portions but I'll eat 3 servings of this in one sitting. Crust is flaky with just the right amount of sweet and the berries are fresh. Pie does not get better than this< /Text>

Amazing burger/grocery stop when on I-80 near Auburn. Food is quality and slightly pricey but worth it. Don't forget your pie for dessert!< /review>

Small modest place with a huge heart and awesome food, I tried two different sandwiches, the real crab meat and the salmon. Amazing flavor, the crab is a subtle but authentic experience and the salmon y a flavor explosion. The small fruit shop offers many thing you find in a farmers market but daily.<//review>

Right next to I-80, one of the best bbq burgers I have had, service is fast, under 5 min, I would definitely stop by again.</Review>

<text>This place has fresh, dried and canned delisiousness straight from their ranch. Seasonal depending on when you visit, but something for everyone.

This place is one of my favorite on earth! I don't get much occasion to stop any more but was in the area helping take care of my mom recently and when I realized we were close to Ikeda's, I knew I would be stopping for a pie (at least). Fantastic selection of fresh produce, pies, wine, dried fruit, jams, candy... and they have a burger stand type restaurant at one end, as well. I feel like I must be their "target market / customer" because everything works for me here!</review>

Fun little market.  Definitely a go to if you're in the area.  I would suggest between 11 and. 1130 for lunch.  By noon it was packed,  no parking and a never ending line for food and checkout at the store. I would suggest sharing a double patty burger because they were thin patties with big buns, better meat to bread ratio.  The apple pie was good, but a little sugar and cinnamon on the crust would've made it delicious.  I wasn't sure about going with all the reviews,  but overall a great experience.  The knocked out the orders really fast and everyone had a great attitude.</Review>

<Review>I love stopping here for lunch after coming over the pass from Reno. Excellent burgers, huge delicious pies and friendly service. They also have a small store filled with produce, baked goods, etc. I picked up some peach muffins for the next day's breakfast, they had big chunks of fresh peach in them - - I don't know if I've had a better muffin. It does get busy around lunchtime so plan accordingly. Also they have the Impossible Burger here... I was pleasantly surprised at how well it passed for real meat.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD5WQMbAYHaVNoSKVwwTTjWZKWdWrpKG4t3jDN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><rating>5< /rating><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>101454896227491402850</UserId.>< username>

I'm a big fan of family owned shops, but not when they aren't taking care of their own store or investing any money into it.  I have seen the Ikeda market for decades growing up in the area but had never stopped in, so I decided to finally see for myself today.  The restaurant side of the building was old and filthy, there was food in the blinds, flies all around, and worn out tables and chairs that looked 30 years old.  The food was decent, but overpriced ($15 for a burger and fries).  Walked through the market section afterwards, it was nicer and gave off a farmers market vibe, but still pricey.  You can tell the fruits and veggies come from outside suppliers and the "specialty" jams, jellies, and other items are mass produced.  This place has been open long enough and has enough traffic that the Ikeda family should really have invested more money in fixing up their place or pricing goods for better value.  Overall it was a disappointment to me.<//text>

Great place to stop at in Auburn if you want a good burger and enjoy amazing pies.  Everything is worth it but if you're not looking to spend 50 bucks on 3 burgers and fries, go to In and Out near hwy 49.  If you hadn't gone here before, it's worth it at least once to check out.<//review>

They have the best pies in the universe, and lots of other great things as well.  It can be very busy on the weekend, but that's because people on their way up to lake Tahoe know it's a great place to stop and stock up with fun stuff.<//Review>

Their pies are too notch, and there are a ton to choose from. I always buy a jar of pickles asparagus (I know, that may not be for you but I love them!), and get a burger from the restaurant side. There's definitely something for you here.</Review>< Pics>

Still my fave after 20 years of going up and down this highway.

Today, we shared two amazing chicken and steak pot pies with our kids and purchased fresh nectarines for our vacation home.

Thanks for evolving, Ikeda's! We weren't in the mood for burgers but craved a hot meal. Pies hit the spot and kids didn't complain one bit.

The monkeys did twist my arm for some Shark gummies made with carnauba wax but life is all about compromise.<//text>

I love this place!

We almost always try to stop on the way through town.

Good pie! Get a slice.

Good fast-food.
Great outdoor seating.
Dog friendly.
Great view of the beautiful I-80!

This is an Auburn institution that brings me back to my childhood living here.<//review>

This is a definite stop coming and going to pick up jams preserves you name it almost all in that department and they are good you also will find some other local jams and preserves there as well which I always at least bring one home of them

Amazing tri-tip sandwich! Order it with grilled onions and mushrooms and you won’t be sorry. The Marionberry fruit freezes and fresh salsa inside the grocery store are also delicious. You pretty much can’t go wrong with anything you order here. Family members always stop by here when they visit us to order pies to take home.< /review>

<user_name>d pelton< /user_name><review>This place has amazing burgers, but the pies are out of this world. Once you taste them in the restaurant, go next door to the market to get a whole pie! They have a wonderful selections of specialty gourmet food items. Their produce is always fresh and excellent quality.  The salsa tasting offers a wide variety of flavours as well as the oil and vinegar tasting bar! The only thing I haven't tried is the fresh meat counter.< /review>< userid>

This place is great. Good burgers, sandwiches and dessert too. You can get fresh pies in the grocery area. Perfect little stop along the 80 to and from Tahoe. Oh, and their granola is amazing. Love it. There is a restroom located outside on the opposite end of the parking lot.< /Review>

I think it used to be better but it's  still worth a stop.  The crab sandwich is outstanding, the burgers are good but overpriced
Onion rings much better than the fries which were limp although we asked for crispy
Baked goods esp rhubarb cobbler and Marionberry pie worth a stop.<//Review>

I love Ikedas. I have since I first visited 26 years ago. The pies and burgers are to die for, and the place is packed with delicious, local products. There is a good selection of gourmet goodies, wine, and craft beer as well. Make sure to order your favorite pies ahead of time around holidays so that you don't miss out.<//Text>

<review>I've been to Ikeda's twice in a month, I live locally and I really love the fresh fruits and veggies. I've always loved the bakery goods, a produce stand I have been visiting since the 1980's. I have never been disappointed. Friendly people, wonderful produce..if you are driving by or live locally, why not stop and check them out...all fruits in season, fresh pie..yum! Local wines, nuts, candy, cookies, coffee, etc.< /review><user>100987517026749056363<//user></record></dataset><record>

The crab sandwich is to die for, if you live crab and butter. They bake their own pies there. It's worth making a stop there.

But if you're looking for a quick bite on the way home from a weekend at Tahoe, you won't be the only one with that idea, so you may have a long wait to get your food.</text>

But four stars because there were a lot of flies in the inside dining area. Likely due to the constant traffic thru the doors. Maybe install one of those air flow curtains? I am sure that is not always the case.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE ATTACHED "BURGER" PLACE I've been coming here for 10 years. Zero issues. They must have recently changed management, because everything was different. Prices were hiked, and food quality had plummeted. I couldn't taste salt or pepper on my hamburger. The teenage kid behind the grill assured me it was seasoned, but I don't believe so. The beef quality was slightly above burger king.  THE BBQ sauce on the burger tastes like the Kraft/Heinz stuff. Really tasty shakes! AVOID the restaurant and just shop the Ikedas.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I'm not a sweets guy, and yet I tucked into the cherry pie my sweetie bought... It was delicious, great crunchy crust, tart fruit, yum!

I am a savory guy, and the burgers at Ikeda's always satisfy me.

The milkshakes can be wonderful, especially if you choose something seasonal, like the peaches which come from an orchard near-by. Even the chocolate peanut butter is pretty darn good.</text><Gmap_id>0x809b056a04c55c77:0xb242bebb67a4ca5b</Gmap_id>< userid>

For the best pie this side of the Mississippi you must go to Ikedas.  Every fruit pie and even their chicken pot pies are phenomenal.   Come for lunch and grab a salmon sandwich or buy some fresh meat to grill for dinner.  Lots of fresh fruit including cherries, peaches, plums.  A must stop on your way to or on your way home from Lake Tahoe.<//Review>

<Review>They were warming up the deep fryer at 5 minutes to ten (open at ten). It smelled 3 or more weeks old. My girlfriend and I said 'oh hell no' and left. Prices in the store were retail plus $5 on every item. Went to Awful Annie's next door and had a great breakfast!< /Review><Name>ed rice< /Name>< time>

< Review>
Stopped by Ikeda's after a round of golf in Auburn.  What a great decision.  It was very busy and parking was a challenge, but I think this is related to everyone returning from Tahoe on a Sunday.  We stopped by for lunch as well as to pick up some fruit and pies.

Lunch rating: 4/5
Fruit ratings: 5/5
Pie Rating: 5+/5 ... probably the best apple pie I've had in the Sac area (far better than apple hill).

The teriyaki burger was good, the fries were good, but I couldn't get over how many flies there were (probably unavoidable as a fruit stand), but I didn't know what to expect.  I wouldn't classify the place as dirty though.  It was clean.  The staff was friendly and the owner said Hi.  The peaches I bought were amazing, and again the apple pie was simply the best.  Glad to have found Ikeda's.< /Review>

It's also true about their pies they are the most delicious pies around. Lines are usually very long and it takes awhile to get your food but I'll tell you it is definitely worth the wait. Food portions are very generous. I highly recommend eating here.</review>< Pics>

My husband loves the pies. We bought a frozen pie for our host and a meat pasty (pie) for my son-in-law. Also bought a delicious watermelon. No baked goods for vegans, but the sales price on produce was a good value and had an excellent flavor. Bathrooms often have a line so don't stop here for a reliable bathroom break.</review>

<text>Ikedas was our go to place for a good hamburger.  It has changed over the last several years.  The hamburgers used to be thick and very tasty.  Now they are very thin.  That being said you would think they would be cooked well.  The last couple of visits have been bad.  the hamburgers are rare (good for some people) and down right not cooked.  I took my very rare hamburger back and then my husband took his bleeding hamburger back.  the second hamburger were rare, but palatable.  We were hungry and had already waited long enough.  Plus I recently bought a berry pie there that you had to eat with a spoon.  We had been coming here for over 30 years.  Don't get a hamburger here! Pies are pricey they should set up correctly.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>So good! Most of the time when I go here I get the BLT with avocado and they never fail to disappoint. The bread is delicous and perfectly toasted. They have tons of other goodies including any kind of pie you can think of, jams,  and bread.</text>< pictures>

I love this spot in Auburn. Great food. Amazing pies! Convenient stop along the Hwy 80 corridor. Works great for lunch/dinner...or to pick up some pies on the way to the cabin.< /Review>

<text>A great place to stop, right off I-80, when driving to (North) Tahoe or Reno. The restaurant is fast - the Chicken Pot Pies are good. The produce is very good and the are very many interesting specialty food products. Sort of like a more local Trader Joe's on steroids.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Stopped for the crab sandwiches. A $$$ crab sandwiche. It was worth it. Pies are stacked up by the slice by the cash register, several yummy choices. The staff was very organized and pleasant. If you are stopping on the way to see friends or family pick up a wonderful surprise of the many pies, jams, honey, sauces that the market has to offer.<//Text>< Response>

We stop at Ikedas every time we head to Lake Tahoe every August. The annual pie is something to look forward to sharing as a family. This year was a huge disappointment! We purchased a $20 peach cobbler and it was like a pie crust filled with gelatin. It tasted bland, there may have been two peaches in the entire pie. It was like a peach jello with no flavor. The crumbles on top were a disappointing few. We felt really ripped off. Maybe you are hurting for a profit and decided to cut back of ingredients but you lost this family.</review>

The best burgers and french-dip tri-tip east of murder-burger. The best food for the trip home, with excellent pies to return with for the folks at work. Just noticed all the marinated and prepared for grilling foods so also thinking about how it would make a useful stop for supplies on the way uphill, too.<//Text>

<text>Great little market, and absolutely love the pies! I love browsing through their unique hot sauce section and the delicious veggie chip and snack foods area. I picked up their garlic chips today, and they are so good! If you are a big fan of garlic, pick a bag up. Imagine a bite of garlic with the crunchiness of a kettle chip meets a giant cornut that won't chip your teeth. The fresh salsa section is excellent too!<//text><Time>1454399835436< /Time><Rate>5</Rate>< Resp>

Ideda's is a great place for burgers and a wonderful stop for pies. We make it a stop on our road trip up to Tahoe, as a much needed break from being on the road. The pies are always fresh and you can even buy them while they are still warm. The place is always busy, so come expecting a bit of a wait, but the wait is worth it.<//review>

I have been shopping here for over 35 years and love it!  The owners/managers keep a diversified inventory of local food, fruit,vegetables, pies,wine&beer,and, a large amount of Asian/Oriental food to choose from.  Can't go wrong- and did I say food to order. Too?<//review>

Super tasty and a convenient place to stop to break up a drive.  Their pie (any of them) is delicious and their burgers and curly fries are yummy!!!  I would give them 5 stars but the prices seem to go up every time I stop in and the bathrooms are generally lacking in amenities.</Review>

Of all the places you could stop on your way back West from Tahoe, this is one of the best. The burgers and pot pie are so good – not health for you, but tasty. The most recent visit I had the chicken pot pie, which felt like a great bang for my buck. The pot pie was massive and very filling for $8. If you're able, I would avoid the vegetarian options here. They are frozen, not farm fresh like their other ingredients. Also, get at least a slice of pie and walk around the shop adjacent to the fast food mart! It's a very relaxing farm stand with great produce from the surrounding agricultural area.<//review>

Cool place! Most stuff being sold in the store is their own brand. Great deli, bakery, unique hot sauce collection, beer, etc. A little pricey but it's part of the deal. Worth a stop just to poke around for a minute.</Text>

What a wonderful place! It’s a gourmet food store meets farmers market meets wine shop. It has a little of everything with lots of foothill charm. The workers are friendly, the aisles are tight and the food is delicious!< /text>

<text>The pies are super expensive and just okay, not as good as homemade but better than a grocery chain. It's always hard to park or even find a spot & you can expect a long wait to check out. The selection of gluten free foods is disappointing and expensive if/when they do have any.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Had lunch at Ikeda's today.  Very crowded and noisy, but the chicken pot pie was excellent- probably big enough to share, although I ate all of mine.  It was loaded with tender chicken shreds, veggies and potato with just enough gravy to make the filling very moist.  Brought a slice of marionberry pie home for dinner.<//Text>

Not totally sure it was worth the 45 min or so wait personally. The grocery store next door looked really cool though and I'll probably just visit that next time and get some pie and nuts or something.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1522207743182<//time><Rating>4< /Rating><GmapID>0x809b056a04c55c77:0xb242bebb67a4ca5b<//GmapID>< name>

The food isn't that special but it is the location. It draws such a diverse group of people traveling the interstate on the way to Tahoe. The store is pretty cool. Lots of odds and ends and snacks for the road. And the pie is worth it.<//Review>

All bakery goods are fresh baked daily. All produce is bought locally. Friendly staff! Been stopping by for over 30 years! Also have variety of fruit & chicken pies. Hamburgers are worth da wait!  Variety of wine. Folks stop by going and coming from Reno/Tahoe area! Try one pound cake! Broke your mouth!< /review>

Buy pie by the slice or whole. Even have some fruit pies frozen so you can bake it yourself.

Great place to stop and get fresh fruit and pies. The burgers at their restaurant are good which everyone knows as there is always a line. Many travelers stop here and there are always dogs around getting a break from their cars.</Text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>Usually great food I've recommended this to multiple people and brought many people here. I discovered it because my resident with ms had me call and pick up food for him all the time. He has since passed. I tried to do the same do my new resident can enjoy the meals here and when i called they said 15 minutes till lunch. I asked if they would take the order so i can pick up a little after 11. They said they could not even take lunch orders before 11. Come in at 11:01 on the dot and people are finishing their food lunch items. Before i get to order. I used to appreciate their food and convenience in pick up for my residents but this will definitely be my last visit to this restaurant. Oh and if you plan on not ordering ahead plan on waiting 20 minutes or more for your food.< /Text>< rate>

< Review>
Someone told me they had the best burgers in town here so I decided to try it out. Then I remembered seeing Ikeda's on TV and decided I wanted to try it. I have mixed feelings about it.
I tried the Gourmet Wagyu Burger since it came with grass fed beef. It was a truly wonderful burger. Not sure what I was tasting that was so good, maybe the hint of truffle or maybe the cheese. I would have preferred they keep that mountain of fries and trim $2 off the hefty price tag, and 2 pounds of fat.
Wash your hands before you get there. You will lose your appetite when you walk past all the rotting food on the way back to the restrooms. Totally unacceptable. Many of the items in the store are not priced. I could not find anyone to ask, and I wasn't about to wait in line to get a surprise at the checkstand.</Review>

Neighborhood market stocked with fancy food, homemade pies and a killer burger bar.  The best place to stop by on the way down from the mountain after a day of snowboarding. No matter how hungry you are, they'll have something to satisfy you.< /review>

Good local wines, cheeses, and the best "not homemade" pies anywhere! So if you're showing a tourist around, you can stop here for local fare for sale!  Lots of variety for sale while still managing to just feel like a roadside farmstead (which is what I'm pretty sure it evolved from)
Also has a grill attached, but as I've never eaten there I can't give an opinion on it!  I can however highly recommend the Marion berry pie OR cobbler! My favorite and they have both!<//text>< Pictures>

I was taken to this restaurant by a friend of mine!  This friend of mine was excited to eat here as we were passing though town!  We arrived at dinner time and proceeded to order our food!  The menu is easy to understand and order from (being from cowboy country in Nevada i was not in anyway interested in the hipster/vegan options but what can you expect in California?)! I ordered the double buger with cheese,  regular fries,  drink,  and a slice of apple pie!!  My complete order came to about $21 (((((whoah))))) maybe it will be worth it once i taste it!! I had ticket number 98 and they were serving people with ticket number of 70-75, so i would be in for a long wait, but its ok,  i will just get some Dr Pepper  and chill. The Dr Pepper ended up being mostly soda water and pretty nasty, just enough to not feel like complaining but gross enough to not enjoy it!  Ended up not chilling though,  the air conditioning was obviously not working,  it was hotter inside then outside!!  Miserable!!!!!  However the grocery store section was perfectly fine and cold!! Finally after 30-40 mins my order was ready! First thing, the fries were just at that point where they were warm enough to be edible but a minute later they were cold soggy fries, only edible dipped in ketchup (if your fries cant be eaten by themselves with no seasoning or sauses,  are they really that good?)!  They were at least home made looking?!  Now the burger?  The patties were miniscule at best and dry to the squeeze,  no juices flowing from them!  They were super thin and cooked pass well done!  The cheese and condiments were good, but the meat is what makes a good burger,  i remember back in my childhood my dad cooking burgers as thick as chicken breast!!! So unless the meat is cooked to satisfaction, what is the point of eating it? The dutch apple pie had tons of flavor and seemed like it was made with tasty apples!  I am not sure about "Dutch Apple Pie", but i am pretty sure that the bottom crust should be cooked solid and be flacky not just raw dough!!

So once again I think I have found one of those restaurants that is cool and hip to go to, (like IN n Out)  so thats the only reason they are open,  not because they serve us great food all the time!  Hopefully this was just a bad day for them?  I will give any restaurant a second chance, and i will do the same here!!

Happy Eating!!!!</Text>

<Review>It seems anytime we roll east on I-80, we make a stop here.

Mandatory purchases:
-hot sauce
-cobbler (any flavor)...extra cobbler on top if possible.
-fresh fruits and veggies for the road trip
-maybe a burger and fries

Probably a stop on the way back as well but it would be ridiculous to review EVERY time we drive by haha.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< userid>

A bit pricey... Is the only reason for not giving five stars. Yet I keep coming back for fresh quality food. My favorites are their pies, salsa and pickled goodies. And if you have not had one of the burgers, you are missing out.</text>

<review>I bought 3 mango salsa's on 1/23/15.  It's one of my favorites and they make it the best....normally!  But this time, the red onions were in large junks, not the usual minced size...some were as big as an inch so we had to hunt for the chunks and take them out.  Usually the jalapeno peppers are minced as well but even they were bigger than normal.< /review>< user>

<Text>I was taken to this restaurant by a friend of mine!  This friend of mine was excited to eat here as we were passing though town!  We arrived at dinner time and proceeded to order our food!  The menu is easy to understand and order from (being from cowboy country in Nevada i was not in anyway interested in the hipster/vegan options but what can you expect in California?)! I ordered the double buger with cheese,  regular fries,  drink,  and a slice of apple pie!!  My complete order came to about $21 (((((whoah))))) maybe it will be worth it once i taste it!! I had ticket number 98 and they were serving people with ticket number of 70-75, so i would be in for a long wait, but its ok,  i will just get some Dr Pepper  and chill. The Dr Pepper ended up being mostly soda water and pretty nasty, just enough to not feel like complaining but gross enough to not enjoy it!  Ended up not chilling though,  the air conditioning was obviously not working,  it was hotter inside then outside!!  Miserable!!!!!  However the grocery store section was perfectly fine and cold!! Finally after 30-40 mins my order was ready! First thing, the fries were just at that point where they were warm enough to be edible but a minute later they were cold soggy fries, only edible dipped in ketchup (if your fries cant be eaten by themselves with no seasoning or sauses,  are they really that good?)!  They were at least home made looking?!  Now the burger?  The patties were miniscule at best and dry to the squeeze,  no juices flowing from them!  They were super thin and cooked pass well done!  The cheese and condiments were good, but the meat is what makes a good burger,  i remember back in my childhood my dad cooking burgers as thick as chicken breast!!! So unless the meat is cooked to satisfaction, what is the point of eating it? The dutch apple pie had tons of flavor and seemed like it was made with tasty apples!  I am not sure about "Dutch Apple Pie", but i am pretty sure that the bottom crust should be cooked solid and be flacky not just raw dough!!

So once again I think I have found one of those restaurants that is cool and hip to go to, (like IN n Out)  so thats the only reason they are open,  not because they serve us great food all the time!  Hopefully this was just a bad day for them?  I will give any restaurant a second chance, and i will do the same here!!

Happy Eating!!!!</Text>< Response>

I'd give it 4.5-5 stars but the prices here are ridiculous. Always came here as a kid always a good burger. French fries should come in a true small size and it could be less than half of the current small fry.<//Review>

<Review>Ikeda's has good quality food and produce, but they're super expensive, which they can be because of the tremendous amount of hype this place gets.

<text>Great place to stop by! Friendly staff and great customer service! The pies are a little expensive, but good. Some are extremely sweet since either used with canned or real fruit or half. Sometimes the pies have seeds or stem in them-depending on if they were used with real or canned fruit. Good pie choices! Recommend the Peach "Cobbler" though its technically not a Cobbler but a pie. Variety of Fries-would not recommend the small/thin fries since they are overcooked. The freezes inside can be refreshing on a hot day. Yet they are very icy and I mostly get balls of ice in the cups-but once in a while its nice.
The food varies on preparation time. 5-15min. The Salmon sandwich is good-would recommend it, however they did down size the amount of salmon on it by shredding it into small pieces to make it appear as a lot. Also reduced the veggies on it-I had a sliver of pepper and wasn't really happy with that-and a little too oily-even though the sub tasted pretty good. The ranch has added water to it so they can give out more.

There is an outdoor seating area as well as inside. I do love sitting outside!
Would recommend that they have a sign regarding have your dog on a leash, so people can be conscientious of others and for their own  dog's safety of running in the street.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

There was a significant number if flies inside the burger shack. I get that people come in and out of the door and flies will inevitably get in. However, they have blowers which could help mitigate this and would recommend investing in these.

Personally, the flies were disgusting. After seeing flies crawling on the tip of the mayonnaise dispenser (on the actual business end of the dispenser where the Mayo comes out), I skipped the Mayo. I grabbed a little ketchup and as I was spreading the kethup on my bun, one of the flies landed on my burger. At this point I said f#$& it and threw my burger out and left. Flies crawl around on all sorts of disgusting stuff. If I can see them crawling around on patrons food, I can only imagine what a horror show it is in the kitchen</Review>

They use such bad products in their pies! Many chemical based additives. The fruit pies are mainly from canned fruits. Super disappointing and rather spend my monies elsewhere.</Text>

< Review>
I bought 3 mango salsa's on 1/23/15.  It's one of my favorites and they make it the best....normally!  But this time, the red onions were in large junks, not the usual minced size...some were as big as an inch so we had to hunt for the chunks and take them out.  Usually the jalapeno peppers are minced as well but even they were bigger than normal.<//Review>

One of the best razzleberry pies you will find. They also have great chicken and beef pot pies, both frozen and fresh. They also make a great deli sandwich.</text>

Just off the freeway with a busy parking lot. They have a huge selection of non-perishables as well as a small produce and cheese section. Their pies are incredible and all their dried fruit & nuts are made in-house.< /text>

<Text>We had crab sandwich and bbq bacon burger. The best, so worth the price. Pies are like no other and the best shakes, marion berry, strawberry, and bananna that I have had in a long time.  Be sure to stop by you wont be sorry< /Text>< Pictures>

There was a significant number if flies inside the burger shack. I get that people come in and out of the door and flies will inevitably get in. However, they have blowers which could help mitigate this and would recommend investing in these.

Personally, the flies were disgusting. After seeing flies crawling on the tip of the mayonnaise dispenser (on the actual business end of the dispenser where the Mayo comes out), I skipped the Mayo. I grabbed a little ketchup and as I was spreading the kethup on my bun, one of the flies landed on my burger. At this point I said f#$& it and threw my burger out and left. Flies crawl around on all sorts of disgusting stuff. If I can see them crawling around on patrons food, I can only imagine what a horror show it is in the kitchen< /Text>

A favorite stopover for east-west travelers on I-80. You can shop for fresh produce and baked goods after a tasty hamburger at their restaurant. Parking can be a problem with tempers flaring in the competition for a spot in the parking lot.<//Review>

<review>I have been here twice, and loved it both times! The pie is amazing, the menu is mouth watering, and I greatly enjoyed the kombucha. The lines are a bit long and the restaurant a bit smalk for a crowd, but it is a great stop for anyone on their way between NV and CA!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I found this place by accident - but it might have been the best accident ever! Their chicken pot pie is amazing. the crust is flaky and the filing is dense, flavorful, and balanced. I bought a fresh one to eat on the way home, of which I only ate half since the pies are huge! I also got another frozen chicken pot pie from their Take and Bake section. I tried their marionberry pie and also ended up getting an entire pie from they're taking big section so that I can enjoy some Ikeda's at home. On my way out, the check out guy told me that they just launched their new website which includes delivery of their pies and other Goods.< /review>

The beef pot pie was meaty, but the meat was chewy. The Parmesan fries and chocolate truffle pie were very good.< /text>

Burgers that look like everyone's picture of the perfect burger; green lettuce,  red tomatoes, crisp onions, perfectly juicy meat, and fresh buns. All farm fresh from Ikeda's own farm. Great produce and a fantastic bakery. They have a large parking lot for a reason!!!< /Text>

Simply the best for fresh fruits and veggies, and I absolutely LOVE their burgers. This is my "must stop" when I'm headed home from racing triathlons in Auburn or Folsom. Yum!< /Review>

Wish I could give it five stars but the lines out the door and hectic nature of the place make it very frustrating to shop here at anything other than dead quiet times. The pie is excellent (get some/a slice to go!) and the hot food too, but not always worth waiting in line when you are driving somewhere. One tip we learned this time: you can take slices of pie from counter of hot food section and pay in shop, which is much quicker!< /Review>

<text>Gourmet burgers, but you really want the marionberry milkshake as what makes this place special.  The pies are good too.  This is for the diner attached to the deli grocery.  Ikedas is the best highway 80 stop between San Francisco and Reno.<//text>< Pics>

Very good burgers. Just a high price. Onion rings taste good but not worth the price for what you get.
If the pricing was better I would give a better rating.

Ie 8 onion rings for 4 or 5 should be $1 max.
The burger could come down a dollar or 2 but is a good burger.

Oh fountain drinks way over priced also.

I will leave it at 3 star Due to this milking and diming.  If price don't bother you this place is good.

Just don't use the restrooms they smell horrid inside and outside.</Review>

Have been going here for years. Always a great stop between Tahoe & The Bay. Really good and inexpensive produce, excellent sauces, salsa, shmears, etc (all available to taste before purchase!). Great food counter with burgers and such, AND the main item to stop for FRUIT PIES & COBBLERS !! they are awesome! Available fresh & frozen, the pies are what Ikeda's are all about.</Review>

We always stop here for lunch on our way back from Tahoe. Burgers, Philly cheesesteaks, and pie a la mode. In their convenience store they have whole marionberry Pies, organic fruits and assorted nuts and veggies for sale. Take a whole pie home. You'll regret it if you don't.< /text>

<text>Stopped in on February 19, 2018 around 4:00 p.m. for a piece of blueberry cobbler on my way back to Reno.  Food was great as always.  The noise level from the kitchen however was very loud.  So loud that I needed to ask the cashier 3 times where I can get a fork.  I still tipped, but I would have to say this was very bad customer service.</text>< user_name>

Ikeda's is a traditional stop for those traveling East or West between Reno and Sacramento. It offers  a cafe and grocery featuring produce  grown by local farmers. It's also famous for baked goods including freshly baked fruit pies and cobblers. Ikeda's produces condiments and dressings including its family recipe teriyaki sauce. The selection is great, but beware: The prices are not for the faint of heart or a thin wallet. Pies cost nearly 20 bucks. Not bad for an annual stop, but be ready for sticker shock.<//Text>

Mediocre ovepriced food, way too much salt, good service, over-run  with the screaming unbehaved brats of over-privileged white people.  As long as the breeders in this area feel this is okay; I will never eat here again.<//Review>

Overall, I would not eat her again for a couple of reasons. We ordered a bacon cheese burger with fries and a shake but ended up getting a veggie burger instead. This was not a problem as they quickly fix the issue and prepared us a burger however the burger tasted really weird like it had some sort of cinnamon Spice in it. There was also what I consider to be somewhat of a health problem, I asked if they had ranch when the girl was ringing this up and she pointed to some ranch on the counter. There were several little plastic tubs of ranch inside of a big plastic Square tub that weren't refrigerated. Of course I was sketchy on this because it was Dairy but I did go over and pick one of them up to at least see if it was cold, it was not. I would not want to risk eating a hamburger or anything else that is being prepared by people that do not understand the basics of chilling food such as dairy. It is also very pricey, it was $15 for a shake fries and a burger, thank God we split it especially since I didn't eat my half and left it on the table.</review>

I went there earlier today on my way home back to NV.  I had their garden burger, which the base consisted of rice, and it was delicious.  It was very tasty, and being vegetarian, I absolutely love that they have alternatives, including tofu burger.  The fries are delicious and most definitely fresh, rather than frozen fake-fries, as my ex would say.  Upon checking out their menu, I saw that they have several different flavors of milkshakes, all of which contain real fruit.  I opted to try the banana milkshake, and it was the most delicious milkshake I've ever tasted.  Next time, I plan on trying their marionberry milkshake, as that sounds delicious.  They are always crowded, and it's for a good reason.  Ikeda's truly is amazing.<//review>

Every time I've been here, our food has been horrible. Undercooked, cold and overpriced. Connecting farmers market style store and Pies are very expensive. Sorry, I will not be returning. I don't get the the appeal. Popular joint but just not for me.</text>

<review>Their tri-tip was a roast beef sandwich au juice.   Don't get me wrong, but it wasn't the typical BBQ tri-tip sandwich.   It even came with au juice.  The toast beef looked just like cheesesteak thin beef, they actually have a cheesesteak sandwich on the menu.  It also came with thinly sliced onions, just like a cheesesteak sandwich.  The roll was also very cheesesteak-eaque.   With an au juice dip on the side.
But it was good.
The regular fries were hot and delicious.< /review><user_name>Andy Chatham< /user_name>< rate>

The Ikeda family has their own local farms and orchards in the Auburn area. so ya know it's super fresh! I love the food they cook too...  Fresh & home-made & their "Tasty Burger" is a must if u like burgers. Did I say a market, too? I love their hot sauce corner, they must have 50 plus kinds and the names are a trip.  lol Their seasonal organic fruits & vegies, waaay better than Whole Foods & not as expensive. easy on/off Interstate 80 between Sac & Lake Tahoe Nat'l Forest. (I'm not an Ikeda & I don't work there, heeheehee, it's just that good)</review><GmapID>0x809b056a04c55c77:0xb242bebb67a4ca5b</GmapID><user_name>Elisabeth Huson Goodman</user_name></record>

It is a nice but expensive place with lots of organic products. We bought a pie, a sushi bowl, and burger. Found the pies and burger disappointing especially for the price but the bowl and fries were pretty good. Not terrible but honestly wouldn't go out of my way to shop or eat there considering the price and taste of the food. Also very little in the way of gluten free options, I really wanted a gluten free pie
The staff is very friendly and helpful and this review is in no-way meant to be negative towards them.</Text>
