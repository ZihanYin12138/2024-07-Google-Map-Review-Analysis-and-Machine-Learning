Now we ordered Strongman recently, and the garlic isn't fresh.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Excellent pizza!! Like, really fresh, really delicious. Every time. Usually arrives ahead of the estimated time also. Excellent breads also. The wings are a no-go but the pizza makes up for it. The only issue is ordering is such a hassle. I wish they would hire a new web designer or fix their website or something because trying to order from their website makes me crazy. The pizza is still worth the headache of ordering, it's really that good.< /text>

<user>112351058660505500181</user><text>First time going here, decided to try a different pizza place, there are so many in Redlands. Ordered a pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and cashews pizza and a side of BBQ wings. I was a little worried but I was very pleased with the pizza and wings. They were a lot better than I expected. The crust was great and they put a lot of toppings. I hate pizza places that are chintzy on the toppings but this place is not one of them. The wings were good too.  I will definitely be back. It also got my wife's approval, she loved it too.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

This is one of three pizza places in town that I regularly get pizza from. It's pretty easy to order online, they have a good selection of toppings, and just overall great pizza. It's always ready when I pick it up, I never have to wait. So far they haven't ever messed up my order.<//Text>

Freshly made, do ask or add what you want & how you want your pizza made.  I asked for light tomato and olives, slightly baked longer.  My pizza made perfect.</Review>

A+ amazing pizza.  My friends and i ordered custom pizzas and they were sO GOOD. i cannot express just how good they were. We ordered an alfredo inspo and philly cheesteak inspo pizza and there was zero disappointment.  This place is on the pricier end, i think we spent about 60$ for 3 medium pizzas and had it delivered to the yucaipa calimesa area, but its worth it.< /Text>

<text>Great pizza always prepared hot and fresh. Shop is located in a somewhat inconspicuous location but is centrally located in the downtown Redlands area. I've tried a variety of different kinds they offer and all have been good.

Solidly good pies. Prices are reasonable, staff is great, they're centrally located for easy pick-up, and deliver quickly. While I go for regular cheese, I appreciate their offering vegan and gluten-free options, too.<//text>

<Review>The pizza is great. However the last two times I've ordered online my orders have been prepped wrong. I don't think the people making the pizza actually look through the order. I ordered specialty pizzas with some modifications but they just came as the normal special. I.e.: ruins the pizza when it's covered in hot sauce and you didn't want hot sauce.  Needs better online ordering, or people to actually take their time reviewing orders.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>It's small but don't let that fool you. I enjoyed a great pizza, the crust was crisp, not overwhelmed with cheese, and very reasonable. There is no dining room,  take or delivery only. I was happy to know that they deliver to Mentone. I will definitely be going back.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I ordered online and their website was easy to navigate. The order was ready before the estimated time. I enjoyed every bite of that delicious pizza! The service was good and the guys working were quick to offer any sides or drinks. Worth ever dollar to come here instead of other places.< /Review>< rating>

< review>
My family decided to give this place a try because of the high reviews.....It was dreadful. Our first pizza was burned, black edges and very dark brown crust.
When we called they said they would make us another one. When I picked up the new pizza the were completely unapologetic and condescending, opening it in my face and asking "is this one okay?" ( If you dont know the answer to that question and thought the first was good, then you shouldn't be making Pizza)
Sadly the (good) pizza wasnt good either. The crust was still overdone, dry, and tasted kind of burned. There was too much cheese distributed unevenly and caked together, but the worst part was the sauce.
I love spicy food, but you shouldnt make your base sauce too spicy that kids cant eat it, if somebody wants spicy pizza they can add red pepper.
Like some other reviews mentioned, the sauce was way too spicy for my child to eat. So after all the money spent, two trips, I still didnt have edible food for my family. TRASH, not going back.</review>

Sad to say I had a vegan pizza and found a couple pieces of chicken on my pizza. They are aware of the problem and I truly hope the owner works to make the workspace clean for all types of health choices.<//review>

<Text>I don't know what this place does for dough, but it's some of the most unique pizza dough I've ever had. I liked it. I ordered their buffalo pizza and my girlfriend ordered a vegan pizza - we both liked it. One star off because I felt the price was a bit high, but I come from AZ where everything is a bit cheaper so it's hard for me to gauge.< /Text>< pics>

Good pizza. Good customer service. Good local delivery spot. A little on the pricey side for what it is but would definitely go back.</Review>

They get a lot of stuff right with their pizza, but there's something about the dough that's off - like they don't really use fresh dough that often. It frequently tastes like old dough that's been left in the fridge for a week.<//Review>

<Review>Sad to say I had a vegan pizza and found a couple pieces of chicken on my pizza. They are aware of the problem and I truly hope the owner works to make the workspace clean for all types of health choices.< /Review>< Pics>

The menu is simple and straightforward. Delivery was fast and the delivery man was very courteous! The pizza was delicious and exactly what I ordered. The marinara sauce is spicy and delicious. The breadsticks are also very tasty. No complaints here!</Review>

I live their ham, pinapple and cashew pizza. The sauce has a little kick to it. The delivery is always earlier then stared. The delivery drivers are very nice and always appreciate a tip, even if it's just a few dollars.😀</review>

Fast service. Terrible pizza.  Limp crust and sauce tastes like tomato paste with zero seasoning.  This was possibly the most bland peice of pizza I've ever had in my life.< /Text>

<Review>If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. The dough has no flavor whatsoever, and the cheese is also bland. Literally had to drench it in spices and Parmasian to give it flavor. Not ordering from here again.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Their pizza is terrible. They are obviously padding their own reviews because there is NO WAY anyone in their right mind could say this was good.  I can't even say it's better than Little Ceasers but it's three times the price.  Rip off...  It should be a $5 pizza at best.< /text>

We had a Dairy Free and a Gluten Free pizza and not only the pizza was overpriced but it tasted horrible, can’t believe this place claims to have a healthy pizza with great taste when frozen pizza out of the microwave taste better than this, maybe they were just having a bad day and decided to hurt my stomach with that pizza but from now I’ll not be coming back.< /Text>

I was real disappointed with the instructor Sam because she made a mistake on my score of my last exam I was under the impression I had earn an 80% of the class to be able to take the final exam. To my knowledge I had check my grade on the day I took block 4 exam an I even screen shoot my grade so I was ready to take the final and when the retake took place for the people to be able to move forward she ask me to speak with her after class. Then they way she approached me was pretty rude like how dare did I sit through her lecture and not bother to take the retake exam. I literally was so lost because in my mind I had passed, but it turns out I didn’t pass an I missed the retake in which I really think she should have notified me that I didn’t pass also she talk to everyone that didn’t pass on that day and she never talk to me so I assume I passed since in my profile I had the 80%. I also think she literally input my grade by mistake In which she had from Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at the end of class when she informed me that I didn’t pass. She had 5 days to tell me and she didn’t tell me at the end of class. It’s so upsetting because she could have pulled me out and said hey why aren’t you at the retake also I had check my grade on Monday May 17,2021 and my grade was still at 80.3 percent like when did she find out she made a mistake. Well it’s really unfortunate that this happen to me I honestly feel real upset an I’m giving this place 3 stars because the educational structure is for people that have knowledge on EMS and medical. Reading the book is a must and study because everything is really fast, however Sam made a mistake and it is unfortunate I was the victim. She told me they can give me a $100 discount but this was her mistake I really thought I had passed an had my hopes up but this just made me realize she is just doing her job and I am another student who didn’t pass because she failed to put my in the right grade I could have prepare for the retake and I didn’t even take it because I missed it. This change the way I view this place so for future students study hard make sure she inputs the correct grade so this does not happen to anyone else other wise you’ll have to pay again an hosnetly I don’t have that type of $$$ so good luck.</Text>

<review>First- Shout Outs to some incredible instructors who are NOT there to fail you or to demean you. Sam- Class Instructor was PHENOMENAL! She constantly responded to emails, she is able to take the most complicated concept and break it down for you to understand it. I requested a lot of clarifications and was able to study with here one on one on an off day. Her commitment to a student who puts 100% in is unparalleled.

Shout outs to the skills instructors Dan(This old salt who had a really big heart and YEARS of knowledge) RJ and Sarah (both Compassionate and Dedicated to ensuring you understand, def mood lifters). While I should take the time to state that the program could be improved if a Guide on the Skills was given to each student instead of each student writing it down themselves- this would ensure continuity across the Skills Instructors; it should be noted the Skills Instructors we’re aware of these issues and were more worried about the student understanding the major concepts to be prepared for the real world and NREMT exam/test. (Example: One instructor stated to wrap the thumbs togeather whereas another instructor told us not too)

The FULLTIME program itself: a ROUGH INTENSE 5 weeks. Its actuality 4 weeks of class with the 5th week consisting of tests. (150 Multiple Choice Final and a Skills Practical) Class started at 0800 M,T,W, TH. It ended around 1600 everyday (some days going to 1700) with an hour for lunch. They do NOT go over every chapter in the Orange book. You are expected to read Chapters by yourself. By biggest recommendation is to Read Chapter 1-6 (or more!) before taking the course. I had to email Matt as this information was NOT put out ahead of time. I would recommend to read and annotate in the book as opposed to taking notes as you will be taking notes in class about the chapters.

Note that Wednesday’s are Skills days and are half day. Groups of 6-8 will learn skills togeather.

All of your paperwork isn’t due until the end of the last week, but get it all done before class starts. The three days you have “off” are chockerblocked with filling out Study Guides, Sign and Symptoms Notebook, and Reading the Book. (Each chapter takes about 1-2 hours to read).

Do not expect to have any down time or time off. I didn’t do anything but this course for the entire 5 weeks. It was mentally exhausting. (I had a cheat afternoon every week on Friday or Saturday where I would hang with friends)

We started with 40 and ended with 32 because many students didn’t realize the time commitment or intensity of the course. In addition, the tests are pretty hard. The Midterm and Final pull from the Orange Book- but it can be anything that has been discussed. Studying is a MUST. I’d recommend putting the S/S in a Xcel file btw!

Last but not least: the Facilities are lacking any type of water machine and for the 5 weeks I was there, the refrigerator at the Anahaiem campus has black mold in it and the vending machines did not work properly. Being a water bottle! The bathrooms and classroom are wicked nice though! There is a bunch of teaching aids that are in good condition as well :)

Overall: I am very happy with my investment with time and money. I can’t thank the instructors enough! But the program could be Improved through standardized Skills Guides for the student, a Water Machine for the Campus, and alerting students to read at least two weeks in advance for the course.<//review><user>106193513957592514008</user></record>

West Coast EMT - Prep Course (Dana)

I took the Prep Course for EMT with Dana and I can't stress how great of an instructor she is. She is very intelligent, experienced, knowledgeable, helpful, genuinely caring -- she teaches you how to fish instead of giving you the fish -- which is great. I respect her so much and she is so attentive and caring with her students. Super super grateful to have her as an instructor. She's amazing - highly recommend her to everyone considering going EMT/paramedic/medical route</Text>

<Text>This school needs better instructors that actually care...keep in mind not all instructors but some are just plain terrible. I renew my emt cert frequently through this school and usually have no issues but I sent my wife here for full emt instruction and she was assigned Manny as an instructor. Manny is so bad at instructing. He reads off slides and does little else. When you ask questions, he has no answers--only, "Well if you read chapter so and so..." I'm so frustrated. I could teach a better EMT course. Maybe if there was actual oversight from the owner there wouldn't be this issue but I'm sure he's just laughing all the way to the bank. TEACH EMTs LIKE THEY ARE SAVING LIVES, NOT LIKE THEY'RE YOUR CHECK!!! Go to CIEMT in Long Beach, they actually teach.<//Text><rate>1<//rate>< time>

<Text>Nothing but good things to say about this program and the people that are there. Kyle is the man. He is there to help you succeed. Him and the instructors for practical skills know what they're doing, but most importantly, know why they're doing it. Also, with the amount of information you need to not only read, but understand, it takes a degree of self-guidance to get through this bc it can get tough at times but no matter what, if you have questions they are there to guide you to the answer. Don't be afraid to dive right in and ask for help because the answer is always going to be no unless you ask. Really enjoyed my time here and am beyond grateful for their help.< /Text></record>

<Time>1588099480420<//Time><Review>I was a full-time EMT student here in February/March 2020. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with West Coast EMT. Kent was an awesome instructor that kept us engaged and smiling through lectures and hands-on skills sessions. He took the material seriously but had a down-to-earth, understanding attitude that was very receptive to questions (no such thing as a stupid question). Shout-out to Emily the administrator who posted our grades super fast as well! The class covered a TON of material, so there's not really any "off" time outside of class. If you don't dedicate all of your attention and efforts, don't expect to pass. I assume the poor reviews are those from students who were not able to put in 100%</Review>< Rate>

< Review>
I completed the full-time EMT course with WestCoast 10/9, and I had a great time. My instructor was Kyle F and he was everything a student could ask for in an instructor! He was super knowledgable and always made sure to answer all the questions other students and myself and I had. Further, the skills instructors were always applying skills to real-world EMS. If you study and listen to the advice given to you by the instructors you are set up for success! I just passed my NREMT 10 days after I finished the course, thanks WestCoast!</Review>

<user_name>Jennifer Babtkis</user_name><text>Kyle is literally the best! He'll bend over backwards to help you out and make sure you do well but you definitely have to do the work on your end as well. If you do the full-time class just be prepared to actually make that you're full-time job between class and studying. It's only 5 weeks which is very do-able and it'll be so worth it when it's done. Super fun class with great instructors! Both Kyle and Dana are amazing and hilarious with great stories and real world experience. They truly care about helping you do well.< /text><Date>1564704799887</Date><gmap_id>0x80dcd9c69ba7a71b:0xa3ee70eae55afef9< /gmap_id><user>114615140530441465400</user>< Rating>

<text>I have had an amazing experience attending the full time program at West Coast. Kyle was a supportive, helpful, and funny instructor that has experience as a Paramedic and would share antidotes to help connect textbook information to the real world. The skills instructors were also more than willing to help you learn and give advice about the course. For those looking to take this class, I must emphasize to read the book as much as possible. This course passes by very quickly but it is definitely achievable. Kyle does a great job of letting you know what is the most important information to study for quizzes and exams. This campus does not offer wifi to the students and I definitely feel that I would have done better in the course of it weren’t for this. Overall, I am so grateful for this journey and thank those who helped me along the way. I now feel that I have a solid foundation entering the medical/EMS field.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dcd9c69ba7a71b:0xa3ee70eae55afef9< /GmapID></record>

Kyle is the absolute best teacher/person ever! I’ve never met anyone who wants their students to succeed more than him! He genuinely cares and will help you out in whatever way possible. And on top of that he’s literally the funniest dude ever. He makes the class fun and interactive!
You have to work super hard for this class but it’s so worth it. You learn a lot and meet awesome people.
Dana is also sooo amazing!!! She taught us for a week and was such a great teacher! Our class definitely got the best of both worlds by having both Kyle and Dana! They care more than any other instructors I’ve had and have so much experience and are able to explain things very well.
This program is put together so well and they make it feel so welcoming!< /text>

Very easy process, staff is very knowledgeable, and friendly, facility is clean and neat. Highly recommended place to renew your BLS, ACLS, etc, etc. Just hard to find because no street view, and directions from the lobby take you outside and no more directions from there. FYI the office is located in the south, outside of the building.</Review>

Program is great! I took the full time class and had Kyle as my instructor. It's very obvious that Kyle cares about his students and your success in the course. He was always there to answer questions and give more help when we needed it. The Full time class is definitely a lot of work, but if your willing to put in the effort it's a good accelerated course. Matt, Kyle, Dana, and the rest of the staff at West Coast EMT make it easy for me to recommend this course.<//Review>

The instructors at WCEMT are all very helpful and willing to explain anything and everything you need help with. Kyle was my main instructor and made this learning experience as fun as possible, relating information to his real life experiences and giving funny anecdotes. You can really tell that the staff want you to succeed and to become competent EMT’s.

<Review>Great place, and awesome teachers! It is very challenging and a lot of reading and studying. The certificate is not just handed to anyone, you really have to earn it. I would not expect anything less since after this course, and the NREMT, people’s lives and health will be in your hands! Met a lot of new friends and we all passed together!</Review>< Pictures>

It’s a good program and you learn so much. The staff is great and the instructors are helpful. They will work with you, but you have to put in the work as well. If you’re going to take the full time class, try and read some of the chapters ahead of time because it will prepare you.</review>

<Review>this is just a reflection of my personal experience here. i was in the weekend course classes for their 12 week program. you take 4 test and 4 quizzes and you have to get an average of 80% in order to get the opportunity to take the final exam. This final is pass/no pass, so even if you had a 99% average but fail the final you fail the ENTIRE class. If you pass the final then you have the opportunity to take the NREMT.

For my class ~60 people started ~25 achieved the 80% or higher average, and ~only 10 passed the class :/ that’s only 6%!!!

The class is $1000 + ~$100 for uniform and ~$100 for the homework code/book.

this class will teach you a lot and prepare you for the field if you take everything away with you regardless if you pass or fail.< /Review>< Name>

Definitely 5 stars, I went to this school in August 2015.  I am one of the people who took the 5 week class, it was honestly incredibly hard, especially since I had no background in medicine, and had a full time job.  However, I can proudly say that I am an EMT for Care Ambulance Service now.  It didn't take me long to get hired either, my class ended in September, I had a job by October.  Work hard and you will be rewarded, I am very thankful to have heard of this school.  My life seems like a dream come true now, I am getting ready to take the next step in my career, none of this would be possible without West Coast EMT.
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

Great school dedicated to preparing you to become a competent EMT. Awesome instructors (shout out to Kyle) and skills instructors. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is contemplating becoming an EMT. I can say that by the end I do feel ready to take the NREMT.<//Text>

Friendly staff, however the class is accelerated and it's 100% book reading. The instructor just reads from a power point. I came here to learn not just to get my EMT certification out of the way. Facilities are in terrible condition. Bathrooms are a mess and smell, chairs are weak and break, they don't have enough tools such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and etc. for the class to use. My classes were supposed to get a tour of the ambulance and both classes did not get that.

This class has no real hand on experience nor is there any form of organized curriculum. Everything about this class besides the kindness the employees had was sub-par. I hate to rate it so low because of how nice these people were but it truly is a terrible school and I recommended you don't make the same mistake as me and just look elsewhere.

If you are good at reading and memorizing bulk amounts of information then fine this is for you. But if you're looking to learn, you won't get much here.</review>

This program is for those who are seriously considering a job in the field. If you don't have dedication to the class you will not pass. This class doesn't require you to have any prerequisites but it may be a good idea to take the initiative to do so on your own. This class is totally doable if you're willing to dedicate the time to do the work as well as apply yourself.</text>

<text>I took the course before and it was horrible they didnt review anything, matt keeps using the same textbook and every class theres something wrong with it. I retool the last class and the final was nowhere near the material we studied and they were teaching so fast and matt does not allow you to even see your old test, and you have to catch him if your lucky to review Kyle is a good teacher funny dude, Sarah is super chill and helps you out! I wouldnt recommended anyone going here and I studied for 5 hours after class needed I did the monday/Wednesday class 6-10 and still struggled with the material because matt doesn't want to switch textbooks, and he dosent give out the wifi password for the students to study!!! Dont waste your money and or time here because you will regret it and be out of money I should know, and the final they wont tell you the percentage to pass it's a private score and you have to hope you passed and they call you if you failed and no call of you pass!!<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><name>Anna R< /name><text>DISHONEST BUSINESS !

They Don't Care about their students' success. THEIR FOCUS is to take Your MONEY that's it.

This is Not a program where they will teach you anything.

Spend your $1300 elsewhere, where you actually get something for it.

Please give yourselves a favor - research them a little - see their Yelp reviews on both Redondo and Anaheim locations for example.

Instructor is there - just for looks, not teaching but flipping quickly through slides, not even reading them fully, skipping some entirely. Not mentioning cursing throughout the lectures and the program.

You are required to be present in class for 8hours while instructor is rushing through a bunch of chapters. There is no academic structure. It’s a waste of time and energy sitting there.

Here you have to be able to take their detailed exams without having the detailed information instructed to you prior. gaining at least 80.

BEWARE! When you Fail because they didn't teach you detailed information to their detailed exams - you'll be told by Matt (owner) it's all Your Fault, that you didn't know what they didn't teach you or that they dont even allow you to know what you missed on exams throughout the course.

BEWARE! When owner Matt tells ya'll that they constantly are working on Improving the program...etc -  Because This is True - you are a GUINEA PIG in this situation, who is paying a lot to be put through this UNPROFESSIONAL program without any solid structure behind it. Not a school but some sort of mental boot camp where students struggle on their own.

Full Time EMT course -  is a FAST REVIEW COURSE for people who already have a pretty extensive knowledge in health science.

They DON'T TEACH You material you will be tested on.

After tests/exams you won't know what you missed, you'll never know what you missed until you are in the field working and make a crucial mistake I guess.

More than HALf of our 14 people CLASS FAILED two days before final, and three days before end of program.

Them accepting anyone who will pay $$$$ and not letting people know that this is
- Super fast and intense program where You will Have To Learn All On Your Own
-  You will need to have ALL OF YOUR TIME to STUDY, and
- some extra powerful academic skills to take exams (where occasionally some of the questions will be made up - in INCORRECT ACADEMIC  FORMAT by the owner, because he doesn't want to make it easy to pass which is not already and ridiculous anyway! as they Do Not Teach You In Class) with gaining 80 or above without them preparing you At All

All these components are setting students for failure. It's not right. It's NOT FAIR.

This felt to me unprofessional and just really money-grabbing experience, not an academic one.

There Must be a Warning - that this program is Not Designed for people who have no health science background. And that it’s basically self-taught.

Do not waste your time and money with this school.

Class is about $1000 (where they suppose to teach you but they don’t)

Book w online access is about  - $100

Mandatory Uniform - $200   that you won’t be able to use anywhere else ever (has embroidered “student”, their logo and your last name on it)
$200 for mandatory uniform consists of:
$45 button up shirt and pants plus tax
$100 EMT boots plus tax
$16 black belt plus tax
In addition the button up shirt is so cheap and synthetic that you can’t breath in it - No Joke, most people in our class had to opt out to buy their cotton T-shirt for additional $25 (they only take Cash for that ;)<//text></record>

I want to start off by saying that I comfortably passed this class and am not writing a low review due to being dropped.

There are three major things wrong with this “school”.

1. 20+ hrs of down time

During just the first week I noticed that we were spending HOURS of time waiting for our instructor or waiting for our turn to learn hands on skills. By the last day of the first week I started timing how much time we were paying for without being taught. It added up to AT LEAST 20hrs in only a 5 week course.

The program director said to stop complaining and just study instead. However, we were told to study hundreds of pages on our own while we were paying (1000+) to be taught.

2. Illogical testing

Probably my biggest issue out of all my troubles with WCEMT is that Matt, the program director writes all the tests and quizzes himself. This became a problem because many of the questions would have two correct answers or literally no right answer at all.

He even quizzed us on a question that wasn’t in the unit we were learning and when shown the error he said he wouldn’t correct anyone’s grades because of it.

This is a common complaint with WCEMT and is always met with “we are getting them ready for the NREMT (nation exam) but every student that leaves to take it says that the exam was /nothing/ like how we were tested and that it actually made sense.

All this is, is an arrogant man refusing to admit his mistakes.

3. Money, money, money

WCEMT  brags about their high (sometimes 95%) national exam pass rate. What they don’t tell you is that they drop a majority of every class due to their grades. And they do this RIGHT before the final exam so then it’s too late to get any refund.

I spent nearly $2000 (nearly a thousand dollars in hidden costs) and biked 20 miles a day to attend this course. The course was fairly easy but the company is interested in nothing but money and numbers.

You have been warned.

(P.S. my instructor was Kyle, and he’s actually a great dude who’s just in a bad situation by working there. Somebody else go hire him ASAP)<//text>

{'time': 1556126096053, 'text': "This is in response to your review.\n\n1. Reading the textbook and studying outside of class to understand and comprehend the material is required of any course. The instructor lectures on material and you must read and re-read the subject matter to understand it. The 20+ hours of downtime? Our course is very structured and our daily schedule is detailed minute by minute. If you are referring to the skills stations, you must rotate to the next station. If you don't rotate and are not interested or playing on your phone, that would account for downtime.\n\n2. The entire test is formatted from the textbook publisher. We use their testing software to generate the exams. From time to time, we have to adjust the order of the questions due to test security. We do not manually create the exams. Our exam questions will prepare the student for the NREMT exam.\n\nAt the time of your review, you stated our exams are nothing like the NREMT. Pretty funny since you haven't taken the NREMT exam yet.\n\n3. Some students do not pass our program. That goes with any other EMT program. This could be due to illness, schedule conflict, behavior, or unable to achieve academic standards. Let focus on the grades part since you left that in the review. You must pass the entire course with an 80% to take the final. This consists of block quizzes, block exams, and online homework. If you fail to achieve the 80% mark, you will not be able to take the final. Would you feel comfortable with someone who scored an overall score of 60% working on one of your family members? I think not. The students are allowed to retake on the block exams once to increase there score. They typically do this before the final to get that last push.\n\nWe are proud of our NREMT pass rate and will not lower our academic standards. You must work hard during the program to be successful.\n\nProgram cost review from the school\n\n$995 Tuition\n$45 for Uniform shirt and pants\n$5 belt\n$25-$50 boots\n$79.17 Textbook\n\n$1174.17 Total cost with additional supplies\n\nNot sure where $1000 in hidden costs are. You probably saved money by biking to school. The environment thanks you.\n\nCongratulations on successfully completion program however this was a bogus review. Thank you for allowing me to state our side and respond to your false remarks."}< /Resp>

<review>As a former Marine Corps combat veteran I found this course to lack good structure. While in the Marine Corps I served as a Military Police officer and first responder. I often found myself arriving to medical calls before Fire and EMS. Since I have already acquired a college degree, I decided to sign up for the West Coast EMT course to boast my resume while I continue looking for a job in Law Enforcement. The knowledge would be useful since Police officers are considered first responders – as mentioned above often arrive on scene before Fire and EMS.  I feel that I was sold on the course and other provisions could’ve been stated before I signed up. I would highly suggest taking a class in Anatomy which was also stated by the instructor on the first day of class. Her actual words were “if you haven’t taken a class in anatomy you’re already behind”. The course is not easy and I knew that prior to signing up. Yet, motivated I dove right in. I soon realized that this course was designed to push people through with valued revenue only in mind. I realized that the courses skipped through chapters and provided poor power points on only certain chapters. The most upsetting part was the sad run down of human anatomy which is reviewed in chapter six of the text. I thus purchased a book on human anatomy to explain what the instructor could not as a result of four hour class session. I was passing the exams though struggling as a result of no guidance on what to study and retain within the material –this helps when reading over 350 pages of material in two weeks. Furthermore, it would be a great guidance tool if the program provided study guides and highlighted important chapters to focus on instead of relying on JB Learning to do that for them.  This would greatly boost your rate of students who complete the course. I felt that I was not learning anything while attending the classes. Truthfully my final decision to quit the program came Tuesday night when an HR rep from an ambulance company came to speak with the class. I paid a thousand dollars out of pocket as a struggling veteran to learn Knowledge while attending class. The HR spoke for almost an hours as I continued staring at my watch. Thus ultimately wasting valuable classroom time. I suggest that West Coast EMT in the future, wait until the end of the program to bring in an HR rep looking to Hire EMT’s. I would not suggest this program to my Veteran Brothers and sisters. I will continue on with EMT at Saddleback college where I was advised to do so by other Vets who have completed their EMT and passed the national registry.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I did the full time 5 week course and found it to be too difficult and overwhelming. Though I paid close attention in class, read and studied the book and felt like I had a good handle on the information I wasn't able to pass the course. Most other students didn't either. The students who did well typically had some prior medical experience or were re-taking the course. So I say avoid the 5 week class if you're brand new to this field - as I and many other students of my class were who struggled. Without West Coast EMT having any prerequisites or entrance exams or anything of that nature to see if the students are realistically capable of passing the 5 week course they are essentially setting students up to fail.</Review>< Pictures>

Just finished my 5 week Full Time Course at WCEMT and believe me its full time. This class will take all of your time for 5 weeks. Lots of long nights studying and getting 2-3 hours of sleep getting ready for the next day including weekends. Its not impossible but you have to read your book and put the work in. This class IS ACCELERATED and covers a ton of content extremely fast. I am thankful I took this class and had Dan as my instructor. He is an amazing instructor and knows the content so well he can teach in different ways like personal paramedic stories that actually pertain to the content we are supposed to learning. Jason is another institutor you would be very luck to have and I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you try and sigh up for what ever class they will be teaching. they will make your experience worth every penny. Our class became very close over these five weeks and have created amazing friendships. Teamwork is key for this class and 40 out of the 50 people made it though to the end. WCEMT is well known and will help you get hired fast.

My personal experience I came in with absolutely zero medical experience and after these 5 weeks I feel ready and qualified to get in an ambulance and start running calls.  I feel confident in my knowledge and want to continue learning more. I recommend reading your text book before class and getting a good understanding of the Airway Breathing and Circulation of blood through the body before class starts, it will help later. It not impossible and they are not setting you up to fail. The instructors will do everything to help you if you ask them, but its up to you to read and learn the content required. If you have any questions or want for the class follow me on Instagram and DM me kirk_lennon
GOOD LUCK!

Thank you Dan and Jason!</Text>

< review>
I’ve taken two emt classes in this last past year. Just finished west coast and took saddleback college community colleges emt course at the beginning of the year. I’d say If you want a more enjoyable emt course and live near saddleback go there. West coast was convenient because it was only 1 day a week for the hybrid course, but in class I feel like I wasn’t really learning anything. The teacher for west coast wasn’t very nice also. Saddlebacks emt course has one of the funniest and nicest teacher. Saddlebacks course is also a little cheaper. I wouldn’t recommend west coast emt, unless you are limited on time and can’t be in class 2 days a week for 12 hours.</review>

If you want a salesman that only has his pockets in mind, and could care absolutely less about your best interest, if you want to spend thousands in unnecessary warranty packages, have a higher interest rate than the bank or credit union would offer which means higher monthly payments and unnecessary down payments and thousands more in interest fees, if you would love to have gone through all of that and then receive a vehicle with open recalls (they will not mention to you) and then have your vehicle brake down before even making your first payment then Car Avenue is the right place for you. I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN IN THIS LIFETIME and would encourage anyone that will listen to do the same. They are dishonest and untrustworthy and they take advantage of those who don’t understand how the car business works.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED<//Review>

I recommend Car Ave to everyone! They offer a great first time car buyer program and let me pick the car I wanted! They are reliable and quick with service. All the associates were friendly and approachable. They made the process easy and non stressful. Thank you Car Ave!< /text>

< Review>
I just wanna say THANK YOU to Uriel and to Tim!! I went to Clawson Honda just to get a no call back with a crazy APR just because I was a first time buyer with poor credit. And these guys definitely made it happen with a reasonable down payment and low enough monthly car payment! Hands down best service I will be back in a year to get another car but for now I’m satisfied with how I was treated and how much they tried their best to work with me and my credit. I know my situation wasn’t easy but they didn’t give up and they kept trying. Thank you guys❤️< /Review>

<review>I was foolish enough to buy multiple vehicles from this place. What can I say other than he's a great used car salesman. He lies as much as a lawyer. This place should be closed down and the owner relieved of his license to sell. Crooked   business I advise to stay away.<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) They have good cars and of recent years only that the staff need to be more reliable in the information they give you because you are going with the illusion of buying a car and after 2 hours they tell you that you do not qualify

The owner is a honest and good man.

I went there for tires, brakes, and oil change.

One of the employees, the one Who has a missing finger. He lied to me and told me he completed my oil change but never did.

He stole my oil and filter.

I drove one month to discover I had still been driving on bad oil.

I never witnessed the oil change yet the employee told me he did perform it. My mistake for not checking the oil myself.<//text>

<Review>I came back today to Manuel's tire Shop after more than a year.
Last time he fixed a tire no one else wanted to fix, he even guaranteed the patch for the life of the tire. And the patch last it that long.
He is very professional .
I certainly recommend Manuel's tire shop.< /Review>< Pictures>

I always come here to get used or new tires. They may not be fancy but are honest with their tires brake job repairs , etc.

My son also replaces his tires and brakes shoes here too.

I will be going to visit them soon to get new brakes installed on my car.

Wonderful customer service.

<text>We left Gonzales tires because of their lack of professionalism. When we arrived here another person said they had also done the same because they were trying to overcharge them. Here at Manuel’s tires they were actually professional. They responded promptly and said they were busy, but gave us a time estimate. Go here!</text>< rating>

<Text>Extremely honest. I got used tires here and used them for over a year. I came back and instead of charging me, this company told me my tires were still in great shape. Best tire shop in Bakersfield. Best tire shop I have ever been too!!! I’ll be coming here for life.</Text></record>

This place really does not open when they say they open ...this is the second time I've came here at 8am in the morning and has set out here for at least 45 minutes after they're supposed to be open unprofessional... And then have the audacity to have an attitude with you as if you're the reason why they're late to work... Some people take having a business for granted and this shop is definitely one of them...very disappointed</Text>

<Text>Decent spot for a casual meal.  The wife and I came here for lunch and got sandwiches.  We each had salads instead of fries with our meals to try and be healthy.  The food was good and the prices are reasonable.

The only negative thing I will mention is that the waitress kept pushing dessert on us even though I told her we had salads instead of fries  to be healthy but she kept saying, "Come on just give this or that a try."  C'mon lady I'm trying to be good here.</Text><user>108107885722943817698</user>< Pics>

Had heard they had really good cinnamon rolls and that is one of my vices.  Reports were not off.  In fact, may have understood them.  Looked through the menu for breakfast/lunch items and quite a few that sound good.  Will be back to try.<//review>

Underwhelmed,  again.  I've been to both locations now and they just seem like they don't care.  I stood at the counter of an empty restaurant and wasn't noticed for about 3 minutes.  Then,  the only pastries they had were the sticky rolls and sweet rolls.  If Lawson's hadn't been so busy,  I wouldn't have gone here.<//Text>

I've waffle was overcooked so I ask for another, and I receive one of the best tasting waffles when the second one was brought. second one was good enough that I will be going back what give it another shot and if it is still as good as the second one  they will get five stars.

My first time here for breakfast with a friend. Great menu and large portions. Friendly service. It has a homey atmosphere with a small seating area.  When I'm in town I stop to buy a cheesecake and sometimes  cannoli's. If your in Gilroy and want to pick up a little dessert try their mini cheesecake. Best in the area.< /Text>

The restaurant is closed. There was no sign or any indication that it was closed for business.  I waited 5 minutes and was about to call to find out what was happening, and I was approached by a man inside the building, informing me of the sad news.< /Text>

Literally heard about this place yesterday so took a walk to get breakfast this morning and we were pleasantly surprised EVERYTHING was Amazing! (Boyfriend and I each had an omelette, and shared the bacon waffle, pineapple muffin ( so moist) and croissant)  Worth trying you won't be disappointed!</review>

Sat down watched two groups sit down after us, watched them eat then checked on our order that the waitress never gave the cook...so we took our three year old somewhere else to eat. Food looked good but I wouldn't be able to tell you how it tastes.<//text>

<Text>Stopped by for the  first time to pick-up some mini-cupcakes for a birthday celebration...A*M*A*Z*I*N*G cupcakes!!! We tried the Chocolate Raspberry; Chocolate Peanut-butter; Burnt Almond; Lemon; Carrot cake; Cookies'n Cream and the cannoli's. All of them bursting with the perfect amount of rich flavor, so very delicious!!  Highly recommend to stop by this sweet little gem of a place in Gilroy.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Yummy yummy! Friendly staff. Open 7-2 pm most days. All the desserts are delicious. I enjoy the peanut butter cookies and the lemon raspberry mini cupcakes. (They're only $1 and control your urge to binge). Ice tea is always fresh . I love the teriyaki chicken sandwich. It has a big chunk of pineapple in it. My husband like the Corrolitos omelet with the Barvarian sausage for breakfast. I live the French toast combo.<//text>

< Review>
My fiance has been working in Gilroy for last few weeks. I come to visit him every weekend. This weekend I needed some desserts for his bday treats.... so I googled bakerys and read some reviews....this was the place I picked based off that. It did not disappoint. The Employee that helped me was super sweet and helpful on what were her favs. The mini cupcakes are amazing. Moist, tasteful and just delicious.. so much so my fiance said we need these for our wedding in Oct. May look into is as we are only a few hours away. Favs on the min cupcakes... peanut butter, lemon rasberry. Also bought lil carrot cake. Was great too. Highly recommend.<//Review>

<Text>Gilroy is in need of a really good restaurant, but sadly Josephine's is not that place. Breakfast was underwhelming. The chicken salad sandwich my wife had for lunch was dry and flavorless, except for the cranberries they added. Gilroy must still wait for a really special eatery.<//Text>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) Small coffee brucnh / dinner in the city nde Gilroy. We stopped there between Yosemite and Francisco. It was very nice to be greeted with a smile and lots of fun in the morning!
Breakfast very good: french toast with strawberries and fried eggs bacon
We were not disappointed! To recommend

From initial estimate to completion of work, this company is first rate! Jarrod who's title is director of company came by and gave transparent and most importantly, competitive quote. The installers, 3 of them were well grouped with one lead, experienced and two assistants. Every project needs to have an experienced lead there at all times, not just a 1/2 hour visit and drive to the next job site. Started at 845, finished around 430. installed upgraded and higher efficiency new furnace,  a/c, and duct work. I don't spend go around spending $9000 but if I do I want the best deal and both in price and quality. Jarrod gave 5 yr labor warranty, 3 yrs higher than next best rated company and 1000 less in total price.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>The install took longer than anticipated,, yet the installer would not stop. He did finally reach a point (after many attempts) to realize and inform us that it was beyond his expertise and would contact his supervisor who would in turn have an electrician come out and finish the install. The problem was wiring (this is an older home) and the electrician was able to locate the cause, correct it and we now have a working A/C. From start to finish, all with whom. we dealt with were professional. We would recommend Fel Air without hesitation.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80db624089510fb3:0xda89422fdbcf5b62<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Just purchased a new home and trying to navigate all the new repairs and upgrades that needed to be made. Jared was extremely helpful in getting us all the answers we needed and helping us find the right solution. I felt comfortable and confident in Fel Air and what service I was getting from Jared. Highly recommend this company for any HVAC needs that you have.<//review><Name>Jacob Bell</Name>< Rating>

<text>Just to start this review out i'am the operations manager of a pool company and am very familiar in traveling out to customers houses to do evaluations and quotes for customers.

Jarrod Warschauer, came out to my house to provide me with a quote on a proactive replacement of my air conditioning condenser and possible other upgrades. Jarrod was a very straight forward and honest person to talk to and work with. I expressed what my desires were for the project. Jarrod not once tried to up sale me on anything and more than once informed me that the upgrade I was thinking about was not worth it money wise or needed at this point in my equipment age.

For me the best part was I felt I was talking to myself when I'am in his position working with one of my customers. That made me feel very safe that he was a honest and caring contractor that was really looking out for the customer than his bottom line.

Jarrod's quote for a 16 seer condenser was in most cases several thousand less that what some of the bigger AC companies were quoting me for a 14 seer system. In one case he was 4,500 less.

Complete disclosure I ended up going with another company that provided me with a cheaper quote for the same equipment. It was not by much though.

I just feel strongly enough about Jarrod and his customer service to write this review to let any potential customer know that they should and can not go wrong with calling Fel-Air for any repairs or quotes they may need.</text>< Name>

Last year Fel-Air replaced my entire HVAC system, and it has worked great. The quality of their work and responsiveness really removed stress about cooling in the summer months.  In particular, I would like to mention the owner. This young man was very professional, polite, and respectful. I would recommend this company to anyone.

This "might" sound like I am a representative for Fel Air, but I am not. I first used them about 3 years ago to repair my central air system. They did an excellent job. About a year later, my AC went out again. Remembering the good job they did in the past, I called them again. and they quickly came out and replaced a capacitor and noticed a fan wire that looked like it was burned. He showed me and told me that the fan will soon go out, so he replaced the fan.. As he was making out my bill, he stopped, looked, and told me that the capacitor he just replaced was still under warantee, and will be no charge. WOW! most people would have charged me anyway. A few months ago, my AC was working, but not very well. I thought because it was 20 years old, I might get a new unit. I got 3 estimates and Fel-Air was $2000 cheaper than any other estimates. Every time their service men came to my house, they were quick, "very" polite, and were all different men. The owners name is "Cliff" and Cliff must really check out his men before he hires them because they are "all" first class the best. I "HIGHLY" recommend them. I have never written a review about anyone, but in this day and age, you just don't find that kind of service anymore. I now need my circuit breaker box replaced. I wish they did electrical work LOL.< /Text>

<Text>I had changed my thermostat and blew my fuse. I am glad i found Fel-air on Google. Clint showed up on a Sunday morning, was punctual, professional, and the cost was fair. No overcharging whatsoever, I would recommend Fel-Air for your A/C needs. Clint was professional and did a great job on my A/C here in PERRIS CA.</Text>< response>

Been without air all summer with 9 kids in the house. Fel-air was able to fix our unit and had better prices compared to everyone we called. The gentlemen that fixed it were polite and professional. I will be recommending them to people I know.</text>

<review>I called Fel Air in regards to heater having a bad circuit board. Clint came by and took a look at it and said its still serviceable but in the future does need to be replaced. Clint was honest and to the point. Didn’t even charge me for it. Definitely recommend them to get your AC/Heater to be fixed. Love the honesty and truly a loyal customer. Thanks Clint.< /review>< Pics>

Fel-Air came through again. I have a Home Warranty and used their contractor to service and repair our A/C units. The tech contractor came out two days later and said that everything okay. This was last week Tuesday. Monday our A/C was making strange noise and it smelled like smoke. I contacted Home Adviser for 3 different companies and quotes. I emailed Fel-Air about our problem and scheduled an appointment with them for today. Clint the technician found the problem and fixed it. Bad motor unit. We got cool air now. I recommend Fel-Air to anyone who needs help with their A/C units. Job well done Clint!</review>

<text>Clint performed the install on three different residences we own. On one install, he omitted the filter plenum. We called and made a follow-up appointment. We are pleased that Clint resolved the problem an fulfilled his warranty obligation.

Thank you Clint and team!<//text>< rate>

As an elderly man I have to be cautious of people trying to hassle me. This company passed the test of honesty and reliability. Price was a third of what other big names quoted. They thoroughly explained everything step by step and the owner came through for quality control Check and to ensure I was pleased. Could not recommend them more.<//Text>

<review>My AC was blowing hot air and I didn't know what to do or who to call. Made a few other calls to a few other companies and there service calls were doubled and even tripled what this company charges. Clint said he could be at my house the same day!! He came checked things out and I was low on Freon. He was great! Very professional and very helpful. He answered all the questions I had. Very reasonable price as well. I definitely recommend this company.<//review><Date>1469135196806< /Date>< user>

We have had our a/c serviced several times by the owner. He has consistently been very responsive to our calls and solved our problems courteously, promptly and at such truly reasonable cost.. We recently got a brand new a/c from him and his technician who installed it did a great job! Competent, knowledgeable, honest, and accommodating. A rare find these days for sure, When the a/c goes out in the heat of the summer and you find yourself in dire need and discomfort you can be pretty demanding and critical. We were blessed by his attitude and service!</Text>

Called them this morning because our air conditioning was putting out hot air, and they added us on. Clint arrived on the scene, and was very professional and by 5:30 PM our AC was up and running and putting out ice cold air on this very hot day. You saved the day, Clint, you ROCK! If you want professional service at a great price, these guys are the ones to call. Thank you Clint!!<//Text>

FelAir came to my rental to give me an estimate. Clint, the owner was prompt and respectful. Working with Clint and his team was a pleasure. He accommodated every one of my requests. He is an expert in his field and pays attention to detail.  All work was permitted in the city of Pico Rivera. The inspector stated, one of the best completed jobs he had seen. Clint's prices and warranty are the best around. He is a Carrier dealer so his prices were the lowest out of the 10 contractors I interviewed. This was job 1, I was so impressed I had Clint do my daughters condo in Lake Forest Job 2.

Job 2 , installed top of the Line Carrier HVAC system, new duct insulation, and a special request for my daughter with Asthma to install a UV light in the duct system that kills bacteria,mold,etc. She tells me that her air is clean and she is breathing easier. Once again his price was the best, including a friend in the HVAC industry who told me he couldn't complete with Clint's prices, warranty or equipment. She loves the Wi-fi thermostat, turns it on from her van pool and her house is cool as she enters. Top of the line job.

If you want code compliant installation, best equipment, best prices,  best warranty Uv lights, wi-fi thermostats, respectful gentlemen coming into your house. Stop wasting time and call Fel-air today. I must have spent 30 hours on contractors research and Clint finished at the top in his field.

HAD A SERVICE CALL 7-16 -13 AND PAID THE BILL BY CC. THEN I SAW A NOTICE THAT THERE WAS A 3 DAY HOLD ON MY ACCOUNT FOR A SECOND TIME IN AUGUST FOR THE SAME AMOUNT. I CALLED AND TALKED WITH THE MGR AND HE SAID HE WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS A MISTAKE AND WOULD STOP THE SECOND CHARGE FOR THE SAME SERVICE ALREADY PAID,  THAT DAY. HE DID NOT KEEP HIS WORD AND I HAVE NOW TO FILE A DISPUTE WHILE FEL-AIR HAS MY SECOND $160.00. THE BANK SAID IT COULD TAKE UP TO 2 WEEKS. I HAVE CALLED AND LEFT A MESSAGE TODAY AND HOPE THEY WILL CALL ME TOMORROW AND MAKE IT RIGHT. IF NOT I WILL POST THEIR NON-RESPONSE.<//Text>

Owner is dishonest and won’t fix appliances that were installed incorrectly. Employs incompetent sub contractors. Won’t return calls. Prices are low for a reason. Only way to attract customers. Check yelps and Better business bureau ratings before going with these guys.</review>

Called the day before yesterday. Soonest availability was for today between 11-2.
It is now 7 pm. And two phone calls later of  "let me call my technician and see where he is at" atleast an honest answer would be better.
Ive had them come by before and recharge it for me. It was quick and fair priced. Thats why i saved the card. Now it will go in the trash.</text>

I had been using them for Service for the past 5 years but seems that the company's owner(Clint) altitude towards service and honesty has changed. I asked them to perform service for a HVAC repair that was going to be reimbursed by Home warranty, Despite my request that he calls AHS for approval prior to repair, He failed to call Warranty company for approval and told me that he did, when i submitted the claim the AHS company denied the claim. I have contacted him numerous times and he always claims he will resolve the issue by calling the AHS warranty customer service. I wont be holding my breath on this anymore and will accept a loss of 625$.<//Review><name>Nauman Rana< /name><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

Aubriana finally answered the phone call  after I gave up on the so called owner clint who does NOT answer his phone calls at all and NEVER returns any messages you leave, he gave me empty promises after I called him 23 times he finally answered , we suffered from the broken air condition that they installed and the coil needed to be replaced , they sent a tech 2 weeks ago and after I called the company 28 times they finally answered and clint told me it takes 7-10 business days for the part to come back, I told him we will be dead by then, he did not even care, and till now the part never came,and they don't even return any phone calls so don't bother leaving them messages they give you the runaround with their answering machine telling you to call another number , they don't answer and they don't return phone calls, they do NOT honor their warranty at all, that part was NEVER ordered. Do NOT even call them, you will regret it.</Review>

First time customer !
Ordered online.
Teriyaki chicken bowl was delicious. Menu has a great selection.   Plenty of parking. Service was excellent.  Very clean and organized.
Again, the food was so flavorful.
Definitely a place to keep going to.</Text>

<review>For me, eateries are not a sliding scale comparable to another. My experience at this place is related only to itself. This visit was my first, and it will not be my last. I got a combination plate, with chicken and beef, which comes with rice and salad. The quantity was hefty, it's definitely two meals in one. The beef and chicken were equally delicious which pleased me. The rice was at maximum rice tastiness, in that it was white rice that was cooked well. The salad was bright and fresh and the only think I didn't like about it was the dressing. I felt a vinegar based clear dressing would have made more sense along with the entire meal. Fortunately, it was on the side so I could limit the amount. I checked in on Yelp to get free egg rolls, which I thought were very tasty, though we were not provided with a specific sauce to dip them in. My experience was overall positive, I think you should give this place a go if you're considering, I will be back to try other items on the menu.<//review>< pictures>

Good food, reasonable prices, helpful staff. Standard pandemic practices including masks, social distancing, plexiglas at the counter between staff and patrons. It has very small waiting area so you wait outside for your food until your number is called (per sign during pandemic).<//Review>

The food was amazing good! My family enjoyed the taste and the large amount of food they received with their plates. The employees were very nice and helpful. I'm positive we will visit again when we come into to town.</review>

I always order for the beef and chicken teriyaki (half and half) that comes with fresh vegetable salad. The price is affordable and worth it considering the big servings they give. The place may not be that obvious from the main street Lakewood Blvd.). Nevertheless, it has a clean dining area.< /Text>

This place is really good. We were going around looking for a place to eat and we saw this hole in the wall. The workers that were there were really nice. The food came out at a reasonable time. Didnt have to wait to long. They also have burgers and chicken tenders here which was really good because we had kids with us and that's all they really eat so that was a plus.<//review>

This place is new. Quality of food is really amazing! The meat is well cooked always. Allen the owner/cashier is really sweet, you can request to customize your order just like in and out. Well done, extra toast, hot sauce etc. All of this at really low prices too! Definitely recommend this place.< /Review>

Love this place been coming since they opened. The owner Alex is so friendly and remembers repeat customers. Well it could be due to eating here weekly at one point with my sis and kids 😂😂🤦 but even after not being able to come for awhile when I call in my order he already knows it's me and the order. The portions are large I split a large with my kids. The burgers and fries are bomb too.< /review>

<Review>OMG what? I ordered the beef (teriyaki) fries on a whim since they looked good on yelp and they are the best thing ever!
I appreciate a good teriyaki place, and this place reminds me of a mixture of a taco truck and teriyaki sushi place mixed together. Even my picky mom liked it! Great hidden gem in my area. Staff are friendly too which is a rare thing these days.< /Review><response>{'time': 1573508055415, 'text': "Eliza, we couldn't be happier you (and your mom) left with a great first impression!

<Review>I  ordered two chicken and beef bowls , the Chicken was burn and the beef was hard to eat , also the add to much rice and it was old  and the teriyaki sauce had too much salt on it 👎👎.
Iam very disappointed with the food if i could i wouldn't add one star on this post,  I wrote a post on Yelp but the app doesn't let me post a review on there because they pay to erase all bad reviews.
I always go to Golden Bowl on Alondra blvd , they have great food there 👍 , but I wanted to try a different place but unfortunately I made the wrong  decision of going to teriyaki house grill 👎👎.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

If you're looking for a delicious teriyaki spot this is the place to go. Their food is always fresh and oh so yummy. They make it just the way you want it. They also have delicious burgers. I asked for chicken and beef teriyaki fries and they made it. If you like teriyaki give it a try you won't be disappointed.</review>

<review>I went yesterday afternoon ,  and the chicken taste undercooked , my stomached became to hurt really bad ,  it isn't the first time , it honestly seems to me that in the afternoon , their quality drops drastically,  I would say the best times to go would be before 2pm, also the lady cashier is always rude to me, she treats customers like they are stupid , I hate going in person cause 9 times out of 10 , she's there . Very disappointed</review>< resp>

Do not trust this place. They accepted the job to repair my 2014 Nissan Frontier, got paid through the insurance company over 10k,
(accident, body & Frame damage) called me after a couple of months to notify me the truck was ready. Soon as i drive off, the truck drifts on its own to the right. the alignment was off. So it's obvious the truck was not ready. I take it right back to them, and they wipe their hands clean saying it is no longer their problem. Con artist.  I took it to Nissan to confirm the issue since they no longer wished to help. Nissan confirmed the Chassis was damaged & that the vehicle should have been salvaged & not attempted to repair. I had to sell the truck. Service King at YOUR OWN RISK.< /Text>

I would never recommend this place to anyone. Please be advised if you want to get your vehicle checked or estimated. The reason why I say this is because my father and I had a terrible experience as soon as we walked in to just get an estimate.

My father was involved in an accident with his van. He was not at fault and he was advised from the other person’s insurance company to come here to get his repairs done. Keep in mind there were only 3 cars in the parking lot excluding ours with one already having someone getting an estimate. We get there and no one was in office. We called out and two men came out from the back and completely ignored us. My father started talking (mind you, he has a very heavy accent) to one of the men. He explained what happened and how he was told to come there to get his repairs.

They then started talking to each other while my father was talking and the first man he was talking to literally talked in the middle of the sentence. This irritated me. The other man then proceeded to ask who sent us and we said Allstate. This was the first thing my dad said when he started talking. And again, while he was explaining how he was told to come there today, they just cut in and started saying “No. No. No. You need to make an appointment and tell the insurance to let us know.” We mentioned again that they were the ones to tell us to come there today.

I handed him the claim number and he went to check with the other guy who walked away. Lo and behold, they find the paper that had the information. He comes to us and tell us they can’t get to us today and we need to make an appointment for 3 days later they said the earliest is Thursday at 10 which makes sense because of New Years. But when my father started to say it wasn’t a good day since he was working. The man said Friday which also didn’t work for him. As he was mentioning that, he was cut in the middle of the sentence AGAIN where the man angrily replies “what works for you then”.

This is the second time where my dad was interrupted and I wasn’t having it. I replied I’ll bring the van on Thursday at 10 unless they need my dad. This is the first time I said anything and he was taken aback that I had an American accent. His tone changed completely talking to me. I asked him to make the appointment and I’ll bring it. If he didn’t have a problem with it that is. He said no and that someone named Jesus would look at it. I asked him if they can get an estimate at least for now. He told me it’ll be too much work so Jesus will let us know the estimate... I am NOT making this up. Isn’t it their job?!

I had enough so I told my dad we’re done here. On the way home I told him we’re not going to bring the van here. He called the insurance the next day to tell them we’re going to take it to another location. Guess what happens an hour later? We get a call from Service King that we can bring the van today. I told my dad we are not doing that and explain to him. My father is a kind and naive person that thought these people didn’t do him wrong. I’m glad I was there.

Please people!! Be aware when going here. Especially if you are brown, Asian and anything that's considered an immigrant.

TL;DR We had an absolutely terrible experience and they had an attitude with my dad who did nothing wrong to warrant the reaction. Be aware. We’re one family but they are not getting our business.</review>

This was my first experience with having a vehicle in a body shop and it all went extremely well. In total it took about 3 weeks for my vehicle to be fixed, but great work takes time. We were always kept updated on the status of my vehicle. I highly recommend them 👍👍</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>I understand that this location got a new owner and became Service King less than a year ago. My experience with it this week was stellar in every way. My insurer, AAA, had me call last Friday to schedule an appraisal. Service King gave me an appointment at 9 a.m. the next business day. Everything involved in the transaction was coordinated perfectly, from getting the rental car to communication from the service adviser to having my car ready to pick up when I arrived. The work looks beautiful, as if the car never were dented. The adviser gave me a list of steps for letting the new paint cure properly over the next 90 days, plus a copy of the lifetime warranty on the work. Some light detailing was the cherry on top!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>After our accident we were confused and frustrated. We had insurance but never needed to us it before so we were not sure what to do, say or expect. I found that the people at service king were the only people who knew what we should do. Every phone call or visit we had the staff was extremely helpful. They let us know more about how insurance company's work than we got directly from the insurance company. We brought our car in and they kept us informed the entire way through the process. We had one person, Jesse, following our car the whole time. So when we called, we spoke to him and he answered our questions, rather than sending me from department to department talking to a different person that really didn't know anything about my situation. They fought with the insurance company about repairs for us, making our lives easier. My car looks as great as it did before the accident. Thank you for making my life easy in such a difficult time.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

He took the time to put some clips on the front end of my low MAZDA and didn't charge. Told my grandson where to put some ties. The car's front end always goes over high curbs when we park. I've had other work done to my car that didn't meet the deductible amount required such as the side view mirror and a couple insurance claims from previous owners. SERVICE KING is great place to get work done on your car. They are very friendly.</text>

<text>These people are not friendly, the day I went with my brother in law to see about getting his car repaired there was no one waiting ahead of us and the reception desk lady just ignored us. Then when we got someone's attention they said we would have to wait 3 days to get an estimate. Fair enough so we go back and they wanted double what any of the other places wanted.< /text><gmapID>0x80c3531043b7762f:0x57db5c7f73adf84d</gmapID><date>1526611994005<//date>< Response>

As soon as I walked in to this place the girl in the front assumed I was getting estimates from different centers.  I told her my insurance had paid me the money to get it fixed and that I wanted to go through them to see how much more it would be because I didn't receive enough.  She went off and said that I had to get an appointment and tried to explain to her that it's hard for me to get a day off work and today I got out early.  I asked if I could be seen today and she rudely said no.  Despite the shop being empty and no one waiting she dismissed me.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all.  This place should have less than 3 stars.  Always look at the reviews!!!< /review>

The people at Service King are scum..They have enough time to come video my sons car burning at Aarco across the street from their business..
I parked in their lot to keep a safe distance. I was told to remove my vehicle from their lot..
I'm trying to be supportive and collect info for insurance, but because my skin is Brown apparently I'm not allowed to park in their lot..although there are only 5 cars on the lot and 40 empty spaces</text>

I called to ask about bringing my car in for an estimate and was greeted by Melissa. She quickly asked my name and what insurance I was with then put me on hold. When she came back she very rudely said you are not in the system call your insurance. I attempted to give her my claim # and she again very rudely told me they could not do anything without me being "in the system".
Needless to say that if they are going to treat me that way right from the start I will not bother taking my business there.

I would not recommend even calling this place unless you want to get angry at someone.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>118057182739275834213< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Before I get started I would just like to WARN anyone who is thinking about taking their vehicle to this place DO NOT TAKE IT HERE. When I looked at the reviews for this place I thought “this place couldn’t be this bad” but I was very wrong this is possibly the worst “professional” body shop you can take you car in for work.......On January 10th 2018 I had my vehicle towed in. It took them a week to just give me an estimate. Once they gave me an estimate they gave me a finish date of the 13th of February. I had signed up for the text message updates on my phone so I can be updated on my vehicles progress. I had been receiving updates stating that my vehicle will be on time and finished by the 13th of February. Once it was February 12th I had given them a call to make sure my car will be done the next day since I had been receiving updates saying so, but when I called they said my car won’t be done till the 23rd of may and “they don’t know why I wasn’t receiving correct updates”. Now it is February 21st and I once again called them today to ask them if my car will be complete as stated on the 23rd of February, yet again they are pushing my finish date back even further till the 3rd of March. They are blaming these set backs for repairing glass, alignment, and incorrect/ damaged parts, Even though  no glass was broken during my accident and no suspension components were reported damaged or tweaked resulting in a need for realignment. Keep in mind my job is going to body shops all around Southern California and deliver parts, and every body shop that I have been to over this past two months has not had any car there as long as service king has kept my car for that damage that was done. If the quality of their work is as any good as their word then I’m 100% sure I will not be satisfied with the services provided and I’ll probably have to send it back and wait even longer. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE. I recommend any other shop besides this one. I have not even finished dealing with this company and it has been the biggest headache that won’t stop and it’s causing me so much stress due to the fact I don’t have another vehicle. I recommend Ben Clymers, 1st Ceritified, and even Maaco. There is more nonsense that is involved in my situation but the more I go into depth about the incompetence of these people I just get angrier and I just want my car done.< /text>

Was in and out in short time, fixed a minor issue from a service almost 2 years previous.  Friendly, helpful, and will definitely go back.</Review>

<Name>R C</Name><date>1415147140704<//date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>After keeping my car for over a week for a front quarter panel replacement, they billed my insurance company and said it had been aligned. The car pulled to the right like crazy so they told me to bring it back which I did the same day. Instead of aligning the car properly one of their techs took it for a drive and "made some adjustments" and told me "your suspension is really sensitive so it might not be exact." UMMM it should be. It was a Subaru WRX, an all wheel drive rally car, of course the suspension is sensitive! I wanted to tell him that if they had put it on an alignment machine and done it properly it wouldn't still be off. I called my insurance company immediately, and they agreed to not return to the shop for the alignment, and instead let me take it to the dealer. My dad also had a bad experience here with that paint job they did peeling only a year later.<//Review>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><review>This place is great, referred here by my insurance company was hesitant at first to have any repairs done by a shop in San bernardino, but the manager Travis/keith (I always mix up the names) really took care of me and personally came out to show me exactly what was wrong and what they were doing to my new Acura. I like that they don't cut corners replaced with all new parts and even waxed and detailed my car.

On a side note Travis pulled me aside and let me know that one his employees when he was waxing my car had left the wax container on the trunk a little too long leaving a very faint circle that was barely visible, so they were gonna have to keep it a bit longer to repaint the whole trunk again at no cost to me. But I told him I needed it for the weekend so he let me take it bring it back on my time, and told me he was very sorry and I could bring back the car anytime for a full wash and detail for the inconvenience. I was happy with that.

About a month later some of the chrome trimming on the roof had started to come off   a bit, I called him up brought it in same day, and they replaced at no charge for me, with no hassle, no paperwork, no nothing.

I will be moving san bernardino very soon and would drive out here again just to take my vehicles to H street. Thats how satisfied I was. I don't usually write reviews for placed, but I feel I had to in this particular instance.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Took my 2016 Subaru WRX only had a lil over 1500 miles for minor bumper repair to the front and back, they drove it 10 miles and were boosted everywhere they went.. I reset my peak gauge on the dash and when I dropped it off and when i picked my car up, it was set to 20.8 psi.. do not leave your car here.. they drove it like they stole it.<//review>< pics>

Walked into Ulta (of course during Covid Pandemic), found everything I needed. There was no Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade in Dark brown on the shelf, asked for assistance, was helped by the gentleman who was quick to grab the last one available. Definitely a nice pleasant experience.< /review>

Was looking forward to getting out of the house and buying some face cream.  Instead I had a very unpleasant experience.  The whole time I was in the store the security guard followed me and made sure that I knew she was following me around.  She would purposely stop and stare at me in all the aisle I went through during my whole shopping trip.  Instead of having a great experience I was left feeling terrible after going into the store.  Other than that I gave two stars because the store is always well stocked and the cashiers and salon people are very friendly.  I would love to shop there but I am very hesitant now.  I prefer to shop where I feel like a valued customer instead of an instant criminal.<//text>

This review is for the pinole salon. I really enjoyed my experience. Maritza did my hair and she is amazing! I love my hair. She is so respectful and helpful. She really takes her time and you can see it in her work. Very skilled. She is very warm and welcoming. She makes me feel like family. I greatly appreciate her. I will definitely be going back to her for all my hair needs. Thank you maritza!< /Text>

So many different brands at so many price points. The employees are VERY helpful & seem to be knowledgable about everything.  They are not snooty like some department store assistants.
Overall a good experience & good products. I will return. 🤗< /text>

<Review>This was the second time this week that I went to Ulta but when I was there on Monday, I was assisted by Erika and I'd just like to mention that she is an absolute gem! She was extremely helpful, and knowledgeable! Not only am I happy with my purchases (as I usually am 😊), Erika made my shopping experience even more pleasant! People like her need to be recognized!</Review>< pics>

<review>Love the makeup and options, but hit or miss with friendly helpful staff. Some staff are not approachable. It's worst if you walk in with no makeup on. I don't know why this store is like that. Haven't had that experience in other local Ulta stores. :/<//review><GmapID>0x808577a7ce822e91:0xc2a94739b232f0e0< /GmapID><Time>1583539572094<//Time><UserId.>107481534132473120098</UserId.><Rate>3</Rate><Resp>{'time': 1583925972064, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience.

<review>I was just in Ulta Beauty in Pinole Ca. Sadly while the store had many staff on the floor and little to no customers my friend and I could not get help. Once I was able to track someone down to help with foundation the lady threw the foundation on my friends face and walked away. The manager stood at the front of the store gossiping about customers and other staff. We ended up not buying anything. I was a long time customer but never again.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Ulta Beauty is a great "one stop shop" store. You can get a variety of products there and even services such as hair coloring, haircuts, makeup applications/classes, eye brow arching/eyelashes. They carry the top brands in haircare, skincare, makeup, fragrances and all things "beauty". The prices are not nominal, but they have a great return policy, so if you try a product and don't love it, you have sixty days to return for a full refund (just save your receipts).< /Review>

I am not the society's ideal of beauty. I barely know the difference between brown eyeshadow and dirt, so I had no idea what I needed to take care of my curly haired girls. I asked an employee if she knew how to take care of curly hair, and another employee overheard us. Luckily, between the two of them, we were able to figure out what texture, type of curls, and subsequently what products I needed to find.

I wanted to stay within a certain price point, and they were more than happy to help with that too.

I'm going to try the salon next!</Text>

Went there with my mom and one of the workers found out she didn't speak english and assumed I didn't as well so that worker told another worker that my mom doesn't know how to do make up and that she looks to old. I will be contacting the manager about this situation and I hope the right action will be taken.</review>

< review>
This location is the closest to my house, but I drive 45 minutes away to go to a different Ulta. The customer service is SO bad here. The staff is always standing around talking, they never help you, get irritable and unpleasant if you try to engage with them, and the store is always dirty and disheveled. The selection is not the best either as a smaller volume location.</review>

< review>
I do not recommend this place for people of darker completion or people with natural kinky hair. they make you believe that they're diverse and that they care for everyone's hair type and skin color but no they do not. I had to go back home on a day of my shoot with my hair untouched because they could not do natural kinky hair after booking an appointment and having them confirm that they could do it. very disappointed. and the makeup was not that good but i ended up paying 70 bucks for it. Will probably never go there again<//review>

Lots of bare product displays & unorganized displays. I came in to exchange 3 items, and the store did not have any of them. I was also unable to find anyone to help me while in the store besides the kind girl at the register. I think I'm better off shopping through the website.</Text>

Sad to leave a review like this because the stylist seemed to try her best. What you get here is way overpriced hair services that doesn't even come close to the skill of my usual stylist at less than half the price.
I was told my "root touch up" for $55 - light blonde roots bleached - is a "total blonde" service instead for $110. It's not like I walked in here with black hair and asked for bleach, but ok. Then a rose color (conditiner) over that is another $75, then bang trim is $10. I went along sure. I thought, well this must be amazing like on those pictures on the wall! Hell no! 3 hours later I was left with what Brenda would do for $75 in 2 hours + free chat and Keurig... I asked her in the beginning will you be done in 2.5 hours? yeah in the end my hair was still wet when I rushed out.
I guess they don't believe in returning customers here, cause who would come back really?< /review>

< Review>
I went  to get my hair colored and perm day. I was  Charged a $175 for the perm and was told to come back in a couple weeks to get it colored. my hair hangs down all the way to my butt. The lady that was  Doing the perm put rollers in. with hair as long as mine and the kind of perm I wanted, it should have just been twists and pins. I  mentioned it and she told me no 🤔and I figured well she's the professional not me. I've had perms before and I know what I need to do after . So I bought the product they told me I needed from them💸💸💸. Did everything she told me to do. I thought it was kind of weird because that night I wasn't even able to run my fingers through my hair let alone a wide tooth comb for the nodding nor the next day😯🤔😤. My hair was coming out in chunks😭. I brought them a sandwich bag of my hair that had came out and showed them. My hair was as dry as a dessert. They told me that thier was no proof that it was cuz of the perm nd to wait another week to see what happens🤯😡. After about an hour of arguing with most the staff. They gave me my money back for the perm but refused to give me my money back for the product I bought cuz it was used.😯 I was so tired of them I just left the stuff on the counter and walked out🤬. Oh and one more thing, I'm a waitress nd I do In home health care so the fact that i had to go to work with my hair up in a nasty bun was so embarrassing. Working in the service industry, you need to look on point.  You would think they would have had some compassion being their n the same line of work. 😣<//Review>

<review>I am editing this review because last weekend I wasn't too happy with the way my hair came out. It was suppose to be baylage with highlights and the girl did not achieve that at ALL. There were no arguing, it was just straight up nothing what I asked for. Ulta kindly honored me and offered to fix it. I came back a week later and have the most BEAUTIFUL hair I ever had! It was done by Gavin, who is the salon manager. I am so grateful and happy for him, he really made me remain an ulta customer because I was really really devastated about my hair last week. He was so awesome and really went the extra mile. I want to only go back to him!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>If there was a way to give 0 stars I would. I used to visit this Ulta all the time but this trip made it extremely uncomfortable. Employees kept looking at me and my family and kept asking if everything was okay and if we need help like every 5 minutes. We went only for one specific item and the rest is just random browsing around. Like we're customers looking at makeup that we probably didn't need but possibly want to buy not thieves in the night. Looks like my money is just gonna be spent at Sephora cause Ulta looks like they are going downhill. 😒</Review>< pics>

<date>1536581922817< /date><userid>111949534666374264213<//userid><Text>Pssh I wish I had some associate on the floor asking me if I needed help. I’m not that into beauty, so when I come in I usually look for one specific item. After wandering around the store for 10-20 minutes looking for my one item, I finally found an associate. I approached her with a photo of what I was looking for in my hand (which was on their website), and asked her what aisle it would be on. She told me to wait and she’d get right back to me because she was helping another customer so I stood in that relative area waiting...waiting..and waiting. After a few minutes, I look around the store and see that she’s opened a new register- which I wouldn’t have minded if she didn’t lie to me saying to wait for her. She didn’t even send another associate; she could have instead said “I’m sorry I can’t help you right now I have to open another register.” I wasn’t asking her to walk me to where the item was, I just asked where I could look for it. The experience just felt very unprofessional like they don’t even care about helping customers</Text><name>Crystal Ledezma< /name>< gmap_id>

<review>First of all I love makeup and I love feeling welcomed When I go to a store but unfortunately this was not the case.I went to this store and i felt weird at the way they employees were looking at me. Following  me every where I went.Even the manager was looking at me weird. The employees were asking me if I was finding everything ok while mugging me and when they say the lady next to me they were sweet and even offered a bag with a smile on their face. Hmmm is it a  racist remark? Idk just saying I did not like the experience here and made me leave the stuff I was going to buy!!!</review>< user_id>

<review>If i could give it a negative I most defenitly would. I went in there today Thursday May 19 around 5pm with my sister and cousin to look for some specific products we needed and had a horrible experience. My sisters purse beeped on our way inside the store and the cashier said it was fine. While inside we decided to use the restroom and there was sensors we had to go through as well and they also beeped when my sister went in. Immediately the employees came rushing and my sister showed her the purse and explained that it beeped when we first entered the store. She said it was fine and proceeded to the restroom. On our way out to continue our shopping we had 2 men behind us the rest of the time. We obviously noticed them and who they were because they were speaking amongst them like we couldn't hear them even though they were directly behind us. They were planning how they were going to confront us outside and check us. We decided to leave everything because we felt uncomfortable about the situation. As we were walking outside we were immediately stopped and our purses checked. They did not make it discreet or proffesional at all. Everything and everyone immediately stopped and the attention was to us. This is so emberassing for us. Nobody deserves to be treated that way. They also had really bad comments towards us. They poured everything out of our purses and told us they were looking for makeup pallets. One of them made a comment saying, " you must love that purse so much that you carry it around." That was the most ridiculous comment I have ever heard. We did not deserve to be treated this way and all in front of what looked to us like the manager. They not only lost our business but our respect. This was my first and last time ever to visit Ulta again!!!!</review>< user>

I would have to say that I'm am truly divided on this location there are a few girls that work there that are truly amazing and extremely helpful! I would have to say there are two specific girls there that are beyond great and very professional  one works in the Salon and has braids and is moving to Vegas and I'm sad to see her go, very talented !!!! The other girl worked at Sephora and I know she was there for a while, one day I walked into Ulta and saw her there I had to almost take a second to look around to make sure I hadn't subconciously driven all the way to  Emeryville lol! Now usually a manager is the one who usually sets an example of excellence and professionalism and while I assume that they have more then one manager I want to make it clear I am speaking about only one since I only had interacted with her, one day I had to return an item that I had purchased about two months prior, I had bought ALOT of things on different trips around that time but I had lost my receipt. What many people don't know and she ASSUMED I didn't know was that if you are a member of the ULTA rewards club and its free to join and I highly do recommend  it because in cases like that they can actually find your items through that card if you don't have your receipt. I explained my situation and her first response was "well you don't have your receipt, so there isn't anything that we can do", which made me upset because I know that wasn't true. So I asked if she could look it up through my rewards card. She then made a face of annoyance and sighed and proceeded to "look it up" took about two minutes and said she couldn't find it and there wasn't anything she could do. I then explained that I did many trip that if she could look into a different date and she said that no she looked through all of them. -_- Which I know was a lie because I worked for ULTA at a different location and quit at the time of my shopping spree I was really upset at her lack of professionalism and making a customer feel uncomfortable about asking for a service. I ended up going to the ULTA in Emeryville and they took the time to find it and help me out so I was able to return the item. She should look toward her team because what she lacks in professionalism her team makes up for it.< /Review>

<user_name>Jema< /user_name><review>Very quiet and pleasant shopping experience around 10 am store was neatly organized, didn't get greeted as you enter like other Dollar Tree Stores but thats not the problem... Cashier felt the need to put a METRO PCS Flyer IN EACH ONE OF MY BAGS which I DIDN'T want... It would be nice to ask a customer if I'd like one not just place it in my bagS THAT I AM ALREADY PURCHASING.. Don't assume I need the flyer,  please Keep You're Trash.
if I was interested in Metro service I would go there myself.</review></record></dataset><record>

A small shop with glass cases full of figures/dolls, I picked up a DJ Qbert Dunny here for $20.  But a lot of the figures here are way more expensive, which makes it a nice place to just browse.  I also found the staff here to be very friendly and helpful.< /review>

Ok I go in for supplies and greeted, kool but no shooting carts. Lady explains to me that ALL carts jn store are locked...
After my shopping I spoke with assistant manager Kristy and I explained my feelings as a customer about ALL carts being locked and how it's an inconvenience for the customer.
She tells me the have it together but the carts in question are from previous owners well, I tell her that this store doesn't have it together because if so customers wouldn't be inconvenienced her response was,You don't have to shop here." REALLY? Kristy is very UNPROFESSIONAL wrong face for franchise. ..<//Text>

The wait was absolutely horrible... But the worst thing? The upselling. I'm not buying a car. I don't want the platinum package. I want what I came to get and asked about. You can be the nicest person in the world but if you try to pressure me to this extreme, I'll take my business elsewhere.. Period.<//review>

Dr John Luther, you are a disreputable businessman and I will never use your services.  You are a disgrace to your profession, and worse than a fool to think that deception is an acceptable way to solicit new clientele.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Ielene was the best and made the whole process as simple as can be. Stephanie was able to help me figure out the billing process and find the best solution. The whole process was fast and handled with the upmost care. Dr. Rolle easily explained my dental needs and was definitely handed with the best care.<//Review><response>{'time': 1616442056678, 'text': 'We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Western Dental.

<text>They wanted to charge me $69 to take my 6 yr old.  To the back and explain his tooth extraction with laughing gas alone w no parent there.  Is that even leagal. But did it anyways. Then went and charge my wife private insurance to get  a bigger deductible and pay.  When i dad made the appointment
With my insurance.   This place is a total joke front office then explain the  after care all wrong correcting each other. Plz dont put your child through this or having to fix payment with insurance companys. They are not professional.  And your care is not valued. When i call to ask questions they just left me on hold. Just saying dont be next like us</text>< pics>

<Text>First timer here, was very busy and both of my appointments were delayed by an hr. The orthodontist had dry sarcasm which made my mood even worse.
But what made me come back was thanks to Iraiz! who helped me out with everything along the way and made sure I had my needs taken care of!
And thanks to the manager on making room for my exam even though you were full.<//Text><Rate>4</Rate><Name>CJ< /Name><Time>1617905579289<//Time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Everyone I spoke to was kind and helpful. I'm a new patient and got evaluated and my teeth cleaned (after not going to any dentist in a very long time) and the process as easy and relieved a lot of the anxiety I had coming in. I had Dr. Miranda and there were many other people what helped with my care and were great. Explained every step asked if I had questions, etc. Some of the people helping were Keren, Viri, and Iraiz, but seriously everyone was helpful.<//Review>

Today was my first visit at Western Dental and it the staff made what is normally a dreaded experience for me, going to the dentist,  a pleasant experience that I won't be so afraid of next time.
Dr Rolle was very pleasant and explained everything to me. Alycia the hygienist was very patient while doing my cleaning and I kept moving around and Karen was friendly and helpful throughout the entire visit. This is a great place and I look forward to coming back< /text>

<text>Worst experience  at a dentist second time coming for wisdom teeth because they only have one guy that comes once a month and after waiting for 3 hours AFTER checking in we were sent home cause he had gone home and had to reschedule for a month later next appt comes up we get here an hour early to check in we waited almost 4 hours before getting seen and had to do 45 minutes more worth of paper work all the while my fiancée had not been able to eat or drink even water for 12 hours cause of the wait then we had to pay an unexpected expense that we had not been informed of totaling 500 dollars on top of that they aren't following covid guidelines very well no social distancing of the sort  either and the parking lot is an absolute disaster due to all wisdom teeth patients having to be scheduled on the same day people were parking on the fire curb  just to fit  they really need to get their schedule in order do not recommend coming here and I will not be returning</text><gmapID>0x80db415e8bda4dad:0xf75038a4173a0cc< /gmapID>< pictures>

Keren Dr. Rolle
Fast pace, wait time was not long. I recommend this place. I got a clean up & they are professional at extracting tooth, I felt no pain during & the extraction was only 3 minutes. I’ll be back to work on my teeth here & I always do.< /Text>

<text>I am a first time patient here, the service so far has been phenomenal! Dr. Miranda diagnosed my dire need for braces, which I was completely unaware of ; in the process helping me find the underlying reason for my back pain. Since a young age I’ve been aware of a misalignment in my skeleton & now I am finally made aware of the root problem. I feel beyond satisfied not only was I able to resolve this problem, we also began my dental care plan. Heydee took my x-rays very carefully & made sure any questions I had were answered successfully, afterwards I met Keren which also helped clarify the remainder of my questions. She was extremely helpful in explaining the pros and cons of regular braces, & clear braces. Up until now I had no idea there were even any differences, I will definitely be completing my dental care plan here. They are also very welcoming and kind to children!!<//text><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

I get real bad anxiety ONLY at the dentist and especially during the x-ray part of the visit. I was so fortunate to have Keren the Dental Assistant to take my x-rays. Keren, was patient and friendly and put my anxiety at ease. Thank you Keren and the entire Western Dental family fo taking care of my dental needs.<//Text>

They are straight up greedy.  They over charge for simple procedures they others charge half the price for. They sting you along or even lie about things you need when you don't. This is the case of name brand charging expensive prices because you are paying for the name.  You aren't getting better service.<//Text>

Went in because I had an infected broken tooth and wanted to know about bridges for my impacted canines.. They herd you in this open room where you can see other patients. Proceed to spit out codes to the assistant. Make you watch a video about their patented peroxide inserts.

To top it off their low quote was 5gs for extractions and implants when I clearly stated I didn't want implants. Also didn't even quote me on the bridges I asked for. 21gs for all the work they recommend which didn't address the things I asked for. Called a real dentists and got my infected tooth out the next day. Also she gave me a clear plan to get where I wanted while also addressing the other work I needed. Will cost me around 5gs but that will include fixing the impacted canines.

P.s. I stated twice on the website when I made the appointment, 2 times when I checked in and once on the way out I wasn't interested and they still quoted me for braces. Not worth the hassle for the "free" exam and X-rays</Review>

<Text>Unfortunately wouldn’t let me give zero stars. Horrible place, terrible costumer service. Office staff don’t care to hear your complaint or concern, they basically wave you off to hurry on to the next chart number. They don’t care about their patients or our time. Waited 2.5 hours to be sent home with nothing but X-rays because they way over book appointments (every time), told me they were closed and for me to reschedule after that long of a wait. We are just another number to them, I only went to them because it was a convenient location for me. I gave them a few chances but it has been the same every single time. Also, they make you write a positive google review for them before they do anything. At a previous visit I was sitting in the chair waiting for the dentist and was asked to do so, ( I have deleted that fake review) you feel obligated before you even receive treatment. They are such a large company you would think they would have mastered how to run a good business with decent costumer service. Definitely Would Not Recommend This Place!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1615741869799, 'text': 'We are truly saddened that your experience was not as great as we would have liked.

Western Dental, Banning is awesome! Sylvia was very welcoming at the front desk and was pleasant to speak with. When I was called back for X-rays, Keren was phenomenal! She was very gentle took her time. She made sure I was comfortable and walked me through the whole time. I definitely recommend this office!</review>

Angie is the reason I go there, she’s a dream to deal with I can say enough about the customer service she gives it’s very rare these days. The service and job everyone else there give is amazing. I don’t wanna leave out the other women who work up front, they are on point and make everyone that comes through the doors feel important. Thanks Angie and Girls up front!!!<//Text>

I went in today and after my x-rays was told I needed multiple things. I spoke with an assistant about my options and she served as the middle man between myself and my dentist. The dentist didn’t seem to care to speak with me directly and after he introduced himself he didn’t say a single word to me. I asked the assistant to have the dentist perform only what my insurance would completely cover and she came back and informed me that the dentist refused to work on me unless I got the other pricier work done. She went on to explain financing options and other ways to pay for this work like she was some sort of car salesman. I just wanted to get a couple fillings taken care of and take care of the pricier treatments when I can afford them. I’ll be looking for a new dentist.<//Text>

Waited 3 hours after our appointment time and still no word on when we were getting in. We were told they were “a little behind” when I asked. I had to complain twice and ask for the manager to come for them to start to process and get us back and going. Ended up being there almost 5 hours for less than 30 minutes of work. If the guys who helped during the surgery weren’t so nice and helpful I would have rated lower. Not sure if this is the norm here but it was not a great experience.<//text>

Dr. Jameel did an amazing job, he walked me through the procedure and explained everything. I did not feel any pain or pressure through my procedure.

Great visit today. I saw Dr. Alexander again and he is just great all the time. The gentleman, Chris that also helped me today was awesome. First time seeing him. He told me step by step what he was doing and made sure I was doing ok during the processes. He was the first one that didn’t have as much trouble putting my powerchain on. Great job Chris and Dr. Alexander. Hope to see you guys again on my next visit.<//Review>

My name is Linda, I started my journey with W.D. the end of Aug., 2019. I was terrified. There was a young lady by the name of Angie that was able to calm me down during my journey. I was seen by Dr. Khasro & Dr. Chris, they took an interest in me. I was not just a number to them. They walked me through my procedures step by step and answered all of my questions & concerns in away that I was able to understand them. They were able to work wonders and because of them I now have a full mouth of teeth for the first time in many, many years. This office and their complete staff are very professional and at the same time they honestly take an interest in their patients. You guys are assume. God Bless you all.</Text>

I was treated so nicely. Had an embarrassing broken tooth, Nely treated me with respect and kindness. She was very helpful in explaining the steps of my treatment, and financial plan. I will recommend Western Dental to all my friends and family. I have never experienced such outstanding customer service and friendliness as I did with Nelly!😊<//text>

Dr Khasru and Chris were amazing. I walked in in tears from the pain of my tooth thinking nothing would happen when I went in. Luckily for me I was wrong and they did an emergency extraction within 2 hours of me walking in without calling. This was my best experience here.< /Text>

As always, the staff is welcoming and very professional. Shared many laughs with the front office and Megan, their Hygienist. I came in for a regular check up and a cleaning, and Megan gave me the best cleaning I have ever gotten. I highly recommend her, she was very caring and gentle. If you don’t like your dentist, or hygienist, look no further, Banning Western Dental has your back.</Text>

This was my first time at this office. Dr. Jameel treated me. He was really great. Stephanie sighed me up for care credit. Thank you Steph. Keren was also really nice. Keren was very gentle while taking x-rays of my teeth. Last but not least Alycia cleaned my teeth and gave me some helpful tips on gum disease.</review>

<text>Wait time is too long, have attended this office 3 times to complete a general cleaning and I continued to reschedule, due to getting admitted 40 min to 1 hr after my app. time. There is no sense of urgency in respecting patients time and commitment to appointment times. Not to mention issues with staff inputting accurate information into my chart and appointments not populating at time of check in. Lastly poor communication between office and corporate,  received several inaccurate billing calls. When I actually got the cleaning done I was not impressed with the quality of service. Please note doctor's were nice and the 2 front office girls (not the receptionists) sitting behind the girls that check in were polite and accommodating.</text>< gmap_id>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>Cait was very helpful and knowledgable. She answered all my questions. She put me at ease and I had a great polishing experience.

Update: The wait to be seen even with an appointment is about an hour. The dentist always seems in a hurry and passes you off to other office staff. You have to really ask all the questions because no one will explain any care plan. I never knew what I was coming back in for until I was actually back in the dental chair. The two dental hygienists were always great.<//Review><response>None< /response>< user_id>

As always, the staff is welcoming and very professional. Shared many laughs with the front office and Megan, their Hygienist. I came in for a regular check up and a cleaning, and Megan gave me the best cleaning I have ever gotten. I highly recommend her, she was very caring and gentle. If you don’t like your dentist, or hygienist, look no further, Banning Western Dental has your back.</review>

Two crowning glorious teeth that finally, after several months of feeling unattractively deprived and scary, Dr Khasru and his amazing and gentle professional assistance made it a true life changing moment.  Dr. Khasru is gifted and as knowledgeable as they come. I'm extremely fortunate to have him at my dentist office. Chris and Alycia shined the final glory as the best dental hygienists I've ever had! I can't wait to come back and I'm going to miss everyone for the next six months! I'm so humbled and grateful for this experience.</Review>< pics>

Go in for my wisdom teeth and they didn't even seem worried about it, I'm in severe pain and all they wanted to do was sell me this gum disease package which was like $1,100, then he sent me home with Motrin 600 which did not work at all. Had to go to the er and they're the one that prescribe me antibiotics because my wisdom teeth was bad and infected. Smh it's all about money with these people won't wasted my time with them again</text>

Go in for my wisdom teeth and they didn't even seem worried about it, I'm in severe pain and all they wanted to do was sell me this gum disease package which was like $1,100, then he sent me home with Motrin 600 which did not work at all. Had to go to the er and they're the one that prescribe me antibiotics because my wisdom teeth was bad and infected. Smh it's all about money with these people won't wasted my time with them again< /Review>

<Review>The best!!!! I honestly was so nervous for my rootcanal and I have always been a little nervous to go to the dentist, after my experience with Dr. Jameel and his assistants Ieleen and Karen, I will no longer hesitate to fix what needs to be done with my teeth. Thank you so much for changing my perspective when it comes to the dentist 🤗< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>So far  my experance  officewith goodthis  considering what I am going through.  I have so far had all my upper teeth pulled which now I wish that I had taken care of my teeth.  If you still have your teeth and they are in good condition please take care of them because not having them anymore really sucks.
They are vary nice and I do recommend going to this office.

Not that it's dirty or anything it's just so unorganized and unprofessional.  If you schedule an appointment you'll have a 45-60 minute wait until you are seen, if you don't have an appointment that number only goes up, good luck!  The dentist are all about money and will "recommend" so much work to be done so that they can make there buck and do a half ass job doing it.  I'm back here for the second time trying to get them to fix a filling so let see how this goes, had a nice 90 minute wait.

After many other Dental visits to other offices I finally found the one! Viri, Chris and Cait were very patient with me and if it wasn't for them I would still be scared. Nely explained all my treatment and what was covered by my insurance and walked me through all the steps I needed to finish my treatment. I will for sure return to my next check up with them. Not worried anymore. Amazing service guys.< /review>

<Review>Chris was so sweet with my daughter. He kept her anxiety at bay by telling her what was about to happen and made her feel comfortable. Also, Dr. Khasru was very informative in educating her on fear that she broke a tooth when in fact she just has an adult molar growing in place.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Came in to see doctor Khasru and doctor Jameel
Chris and Nely. They were all very professional and gave me the best option. I will be coming in for a root canal and I am no longer scared. They made sure I was comfortable with my decision and explained everything. Very happy with my visit.</Review>

I’ve been coming to this office for some years now and I can honestly say I love it here. From the front office Sylvia, Angie, Nilvia, Iraiz and Veronica to the back office Christin, Nikki and Viridiana. They are all so sweet and genuinely caring. They are always in communication with my mom and I as she also has been there for years and we both appreciate them so much! Thanks Banning team for all you do for your patients.</text>

<review>1st appointment made me feel like I was at a car dealership. Buy this, upsell that, buy these braces, by this special gel, etc. Money hungry facility. Went for a cleaning, waited for almost an hour just so they could tell me it would cost $300 for a cleaning...A CLEANING with insurance. Say huh LOL? I walked out and wasted an hour of my day on a Saturday. Never again, never will recommend. Going to a dentist down the street where my husband has had NO issues with.<//review>< response>

<review>1st appointment made me feel like I was at a car dealership. Buy this, upsell that, buy these braces, by this special gel, etc. Money hungry facility. Went for a cleaning, waited for almost an hour just so they could tell me it would cost $300 for a cleaning...A CLEANING with insurance. Say huh LOL? I walked out and wasted an hour of my day on a Saturday. Never again, never will recommend. Going to a dentist down the street where my husband has had NO issues with.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I was a new patient and was treated with the upmost respect. The staff Stephany, Angelica, Viri, Ielene, Dr. Khosiu, Dr. Jameel, Chris, Nelly, Sylvia, Cait, Iraiz, Veronica and Keren made sure I was comfortable and not in pain while I had my procedures done. I would recommend them to family and friends. Thank you.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

<Review>My three-year-old boy is a first-time patient in Western Dental and I was nervous at first hoping that he will be cooperative. I was trying to make the trip fun and Light, and Dr Khasru made it so much more easier on me. He was very friendly and gentle with my boy and even let him sit on top of me so that he won't be anxious or nervous. Because of his patience, my son was able to be cooperative and let the Doctor take xray pics and 3D pictures as well. My little boy had a very good experience in this place! I know that it is not easy  to work with little kids who are anxious and nervous , so I appreciate it Dr.Khasru, thank you< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1542053620458, 'text': 'Crystalline, we are happy to hear your sons experience was to your expectations.

<Review>Very unprofessional. Not organized sitting for hours with an appointment. People go in for cleanings and for the orthodontist to change rubber bands and tie in braces and then leaves home for the day and patients go home with a wire Because the doctor left home EARLY.  How can you have a schedule an appointment for your braces and cleaning and for them to tell you it's OK to be without your wire for 2 to 3 days because the doctor left. The staff does not know how to talk to patients professionally and when they do they tried to con them into getting something that they don't want, when you hear a  patient say no  Stop talking and making them uncomfortable.<//Review><user_name>Cathy Macias<//user_name><pics>None<//pics></record>

My granddaughter had to have a couple teeth pulled and was very scared. She is 6 years old and Dr Jandali and her assistant Cinthia were patient and explained what they were going to do and she did great. Today we had to have spacers put in and once again they did a great job! I would highly recommend Dr Jandali!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I came in with an excruciating toothache and needed it extracted. I came in as a walk in and I understand that there were patients before me so I did have to wait a while. The receptionist, Angie, and the dental assistant, Viri, were really nice and helpful. Angie gave me some pain killers to try to help with my pain and even put me down as an emergency visit. Viri came and checked on me and kept me updated while the doctor was finishing up another patient. Christian was very comforting and kept a smile on my face as i waited. I really don't like going to the dentist and since this was my first time in a while, I'm glad I came here. I got what I was expecting to have done. My only issue was having to wait almost 2 hours to finally be seen.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Specialist my ass. Thank you W.D.- Banning,  Ca. whom ever was nice enough to finally helping my poor husband out with his very painful 45 year old baby tooth. Thank you so much for pulling that damn thing out, and not making him wait longer. He's been dealing with the tooth being infected for about 2 1/2 week's.  That caused him to be dizzy all the time, headaches and vomiting from time to time. Plus being a diabetic made things worse for him, then for others. Unlike the other W.D. and one other denisit group, you made him a priority today, unlike the others. Thank you so much,  as his wife the worried went away.

I hadn't been to see a dentist in 17 years.   I dont have a particular reason- just never had any pain.  But with that said, All people that are afraid of the dentist should have gone with me today.  I had 2 appointments today.  From the moment I walked in I was helped by some very beautiful young ladies and seated. I was called to meet the ortho and a young- also beautiful woman began to prep me and answered any and all questions I had.   I met the ortho surgeon who was male and also very nice. ( My teeth are drifting apart and I was concerned I would have rotten teeth, unusable for braces  It had been 17 years afterall.)  I was given a good examination by somebody with knowledge. I was deemed good for braces.  I have no money so it's for the future.
My 2nd appt was for a cleaning- I really feared bad news from the dentist.  I was called 10 min after my prior appt. I had x rays done and had to bite on plastic which wasn't so bad I just have a small gag reflex with the plastic throwaway sleeve they cover the biting part with.  The gorgeous young lady that took the xrays was also extremely helpful in any of the Q&A I had.  I was moved to a different room where they would actually do the cleaning.  I met the dentist-  This guy was middle aged and cracking jokes.  He is awesome.  I feared his news after a young woman(also beautiful) came and took different pictures of my teeth and.. dried them.  The dentist saw me and had me open wide, he searched for cavities and other complications and found none- which is awesome! Yay Me!  After sooo long of not seeing a dentist I really didnt expect that.  I try to take care of my teeth but I dont floss.  It was now time for my cleaning.  I think I am like everyone when I say having power tools in your mouth can be quite scary.  But, BUT- they've made leaps and bounds in dentistry since 17 years ago.  The tools are very small and not very noisy.  I braced for some sort of pain while they turned on the tool and started cleaning- there was none.  The most awkward anything was the sensation of the tool doing its job in front and behind my teeth.  My dentist finished cleaning , cracked some more jokes and ran off to some other beautiful smile to help.  A young woman chatted with me while finishing with flouride and asked me to rate them and so I am here!  These guys kick ass, All of em! Everyone that I spoke to or had questions with was genuinely professional,  pleasant, and courteous. ... and beautiful.

I understand that wait times could be different and that you may need more than just a cleaning.  In my experience when you find a good place filled with heartfelt, wonderful people,- it normally stays that way.  This Western Dental has it in spades and I recommend any and all to go and check em out.

Sorry to all at Western Dental in Banning I am extremely horrible with names.  You guys keep kickin ass, I'll see you guys soon :)</review>

I made an appointment for my son and I for 1:30 and 2pm. Got to the office at 1:15. Didnt get called in tbe back until 2:45. My son got called in the back at 3pm. Here it is going on 5pm and we are still sitting here. They close in an hour. No chairs for parents to sit down on while their child gets 3 hour waiting work done. Im so disappointed in the professional manner this plce has. We wont be returning.<//Text>

<text>My daughter had her 6 month check up today at this location. The service was outstanding from the secretary, techs, and the dentist, Dr. Bateol! We were able to walk-in and less than 2 hours had the check up done. Dr. Bateol was so compassionate with my 7 year old, and took the time to talk to her. Mr. Iraiz was very caring too. Mrs. Christoon took are of the paperwork and explained details in a simple, easy to understand way. Overall, this was a great experience!!< /text>< username>

<date>1503696711797< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The staff are not friendly.  They triple book appointments and make patients wait for a very long time.   They split x-rays, exams and cleanings into 3 appts and each one takes from 1.5-2 hours.  All 3 things could be accomplished start to finish in 1.5 hours,  NOT 3 sessions totaling 4-6 hours.  On top of all that,  the staff purposely try to upsell services and don't mention that these services (i.e. white filings versus silver) are NOT COVERED under insurance.  They make it seem like these services are completely medically necessary (antibiotic cleansing,  fluoride sealants), don't inform you of covered options, etc.  and my husband walked away with a $600 bill!! I realized what they were doing at my appt and point blank asked them if those recommendations were covered under insurance at which point they stalled and tried to talk around a straight answer. They're in it only for the profit and we're NEVER going back.  We switched dentists.<//Review>< pictures>

Very long wait time and poor job.  Went in to get my temporary crown replaced and waited 1 hour and 30 minutes to get in.  I could tell the dental assistance was getting stress out when she couldn't get my bite to even out each time she was fitting my temporary crown on.  So she did what she could and stated it may need to be replace or remade in my next proceedure.  Sure enough it fell right off the next day.  My next problem was, the periodontist wasn't available for a month, so that meant I had to drive out of town to meet him at a different location if I want to get my dental work done faster.  After I've got my dental bill contract situated, they schedule my next appointment and I left home.  Days later western dental called me and told me they wanted to confirm if I had any future appointments with them because they didn't have anything in their system for me, which I thought was very unorganized and careless of them, but because they gave me a card with my next appointment date, time, and locatiom, I was able to update that for them over the phone.

So I drove out of town to meet the periodontist a couple weeks later.  The lady working at the front desk checked me in and made me fill out a new application, and afterwards stated that because they are although it's the same company, they are a different location and due to policy they don't share or transferred pt information.  Then she proceeds to tell me I have to pay an extra $130 out of pocket because I've used up all my insurance allowance at the previous office visit.  I was frustrated because I've already establish my dental bill that would include all my procedure.  It was my understanding that all I need to do was follow up with my appointments.  So after I disagree, a few phone calls were made by western dental and the office finally agree to let me see the periodontist as scheduled.  My appointment was suppose to be at 11 am, instead they pushed it back to 230pm that day, and when I showed up on time, I waited another hour to get seen for a 15 minute proceedure.

As of right now I really want to switch companies because of the bad services I recieved.  I have one more procedure and I hope it goes smoothly. I know I said alot, but it's important for people to know the the kind of service they're paying for and I wouldn't recommend western dental to my family.<//Text>

<review>This place is a joke, I’m supposed to be on vacation but I had to come in because one of my molars started to hurt. Since I got here they took about an hour just to sign me in, and about another 2 hours before I was even seen. They put me in the back room and just forgot about me. Other patients who had later appointments came in and were out in no time. If I could give no stars on here I would.</review>< Name>

If I could put less than a star I would I am completely unsatisfied with this unorganized place of business I believe that a dentist office should be clean and it's one of the dirtiest places I've been to in Banning I had an appointment for 3:45 its 5:15 right now and they still haven't attended me I also had a second appointment for 4:45 and I haven't been called to either one<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Don't waste your time with this place. That is exactly what happens here, they waste their time because many people quote for a while but they cannot see everyone. My son had an appointment at 4:30, orita is 5:45 and they still haven't called him. I wouldn't be so mad if this didn't happen almost every time I come. And since his brakes are under contract, I can't go anywhere else. My daughter continues to put on the brakes and not even free to come to this place.
Don't waste your time coming here. That is exactly what will happen, your time will be wasted. My son's appointment was at 4:30, it's now 5:45 and hasn't been seen yet. It wouldn't be so bad if this didn't happen almost every time we come here. They overbook ALL the time. I'm just so sick of my time being wasted. I had something else scheduled after this and had to cancel because they don't respect peoples' time here. I've wanted to write a review so many times. I have had so many negative experiences here, but I'm an optimist and always want to give people / establishments another chance. I wish I could change my son's orthodontist but can't because we're under contract. My daughter is next to get braces and they couldn't pay me to bring her here. Just don't waste your time.

No pierdan el tiempo con este lugar. Eso es exactamente lo que pasa aqui, pierden el tiempo porque citan muchas personas para un tiempo pero no pueden ver a todos. Mi hijo tenia una cita a las 4:30, orita son las 5:45 y todavía no lo han llamado. No me enfadara tanto si esto no pasara casi cada vez que vengo. Y como sus frenos estan bajo contrato no puedo ir a ningun otro lugar. Mi hija sigue en ponerse los frenos y ni gratis viniera a este lugar.
