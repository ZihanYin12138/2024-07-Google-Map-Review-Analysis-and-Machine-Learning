I was very happy with the work the other time I had you work on my car but when I called to get a price for changing my brakes only i was informed that my rotors had to be turned also. I have two month old rotors which didn’t need to be turned, plus you would not take my brakes that I had and put them on. All I wanted was for you to change my brakes and I could not get that done without other work<//review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Invoice  # 30707
I am a service writer that had been in the business for over 10 years .with the recent COVID-19 .I was forced out of work and my wife’s car needed a smog test. I had a Evap issue with a check engine light. With money tight I was relieved to find that San Joaquin county  has a program Tune in tune up that gave a $850.00 voucher. I called around to a few shops looking for a shop that would take my voucher Bruce and jacks auto was one of the listed vendors. I called in and made a reservation two weeks in advance.I dropped my car off on 2/9/21 and was informed two days later that I needed a $30 vacuum baffle and that my voucher would cover the charges” not aware until later on other additional charges “ I was told to drive until my computer monitors were all set and bring it back to smog it. picked up my car and that same night my check engine light came back this was 2/12 Friday night .I called back on Monday was told to bring it back which I did the same day. I was then called on 2/17 and was told the repair was $1493.00. And after my voucher . I had to pay the difference of $643.00
I checked the invoice and was charge for a “road test”$60.00 with out approval. that I performed the past Friday I didn’t know why I was being penalized for a misdiagnosis and was charged for a “bay test” after already being charged $75 diagnostics fee .which they misdiagnosed . 2/22/21 When I came in with my friend to pick up my car “Ron” the unpleasant man behind the counter once again stated that I would have to drive the car and bring it back. I asked him a few questions regarding the charges he did not give me a exact reason for them just told me that’s what they did and I had to pay and he didn’t care what I said .he was rude when asked why I was being charged for certain diagnoses and a road test and what a “ bay test” was he had no explanation he stated there is no law on what we can charge”. I then told  him I was going to inform the “BAR” he once again said I don’t care. I have right to question my invoice fees. He then stated I have to pay $50 for a smog when I return. All I asked was for a little explanation  not very good customer service. I wanted a good experience but it didn’t happen. Hope your car doesn’t end up here.</text><UserId.>112025590067585209370</UserId.>< Rate>

Paul and his technicians helped me when I was in Stockton in a bind. And promptly too. The metal protective plate under my car had come undone and was scraping the street. They removed it for me. My pastor and his family have taken their cars here for years. Very friendly and professional. Highly recommend Bruce and Jack.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very good attention, the place is very clean, but the office to obtain information about the place is inside the shop on a corner and to get to it you have to cross the work area, and there is nothing to protect the client.

The ground around the tables was a bit dirty with sticky spills but overall great neighborhood park. I love that the park is next door to the fire dept. All of the playground equipment is within close proximity to one another which enables you to keep your eyes on your children at all times.< /Text>

We love this park. Most yif the time it's really clean(broken glass was everywhere once for a few days), but there are no restrooms at this park. There is a big field with large trees around it which is lovely. And it's next to a school so it's nice hearing the kids play.<//Text>

Very nice little park for children to play & to walk your dogs,  IF you'll pick uo their poo. There's a giant open space,  that's perfect for kites, baseball catch,  soccer games /practice. (2 to 3 teams could probably all fit at the same time).

Lately, however, I have noticed that it's become a hangout for people to smoke the green stuff that's now legal.
So I don't  wouldn't like my children around that.

The doggies love it here, but they've  been getting tons of stickers on their paws.😥😣😞😟☹☹😦
It's sad... I wish the City would spray all the grass and kill the awful weeds that cause havoc on the dogs paw pads and on children running around in the grass barefoot.

Also ..The CITY NEEDS TO PROVIDE DOGGIE POOP BAG & TRASH STATIONS, LIKE THEY DO AT HAGGIN OAKS PARK.
Maybe then people will clean-up their dog-poo.<//text>

<Review>As a parent of a team gymnast, I can not say enough good things about Airborne after experiencing 2 other competing gyms in the area. Airborne and its team coaches are dedicated to the girls and their success. The feedback my daughter receives while being coached is always done in a positive manner. Through Covid, Airborne did everything they possibly could under the County guidelines to continue the team’s training and we are forever grateful. Parents can observe practices through Spot TV. The facility is regularly sanitized and exceptionally clean with health and safety being top priority at the gym. Airborne is our daughter’s “happy place”. She loves gymnastics and Airborne is the perfect fit for her and our family.</Review>< user_name>

< Review>
My son has attended Airborne's Mini Mach, Mach 1 and now their Mach 2 parkour classes. He also has celebrated 2 birthdays there. Those alone are worth 4 stars.

However, the reason why I gave 5 stars and why I recommend them to anyone who has a kid who needs to get some energy out: when the restrictions were lifted and we came back for class and camps, they were so excited to see my son. All the staff who knew him welcomed him back. It was very special to see a place that he loves love him back.

So give them a try. I'm pretty sure you'll be happy you did.</Review>

This place is the best for kids  gymnastics camps and classes. Great with following COVID restrictions, you can watch your kids on their app through the cameras throughout the building. Easy drop off and pickup, friendly and knowledgeable coaches/staff.</Review>

Good place for kids. Teachers are good. They have all needed equipment too. Even the young lady from reception staff is good, but the old lady is too rigid. Because of the rigidness i wanted to give 1 or 2 stars only but just because of 1 person,I can not overlook the good thing they have.</Review>

I came here for a birthday party.

Parking is difficult!  It is in an office complex and I wasn't sure if I was parking in an approved spot or not.

The party was for 5 to 6 yr olds.  There was a separate sign in table for the birthday.  It would be helpful to know in advance that the children need to be barefoot, as some of the girls came wearing tights.  The staff was attentive to the kids.  There were bleachers on 1 side of the gym, where the parents could sit and watch.

After the play, the party continued upstairs.  There was additional bleacher  seating in front of a large window where you could see the entire gym floor below. There were also additional bathrooms upstairs.

The kids had a great time and the parents had an opportunity to talk.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Worst policy ever. Don’t go if you want to see how your kids are doing on gym. The admins and coaches don’t allow to watch on my kid in dynomight class:(.

The owner in the comments replied that viewing areas are available for parents, but it is not entirely true. Some corner areas with bars are completely invisible for parents, but I think we have full right to check our kids progress especially at such disciplines as bars, etc, which are not trivial.

Asking for help at the desk is no help at all, because associates there are simply unhelpful not to say rude.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1566925630515, 'text': 'Hello Olena,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

<review>Coaches are great, but admin staff at the front desk is not very friendly and sometimes simply rude.
I’ve been forced to pay double the price for kids birthday party because receptionist has made a reservation for 20 kids instead of requested 10.
And even after after trying to convince them that it was their mistake, they still kept referring to emails they’ve sent, that had a number of guests.<//review>< response>

<rating>2<//rating><review>The communication among staff members to clients are very disruptive.  I called to place my children on summer camp, and the session I would like was full.  The manager added a coach and was able to accept my children.  I was told I have to pay the next business day, but there was a holiday in between, Memorial weekend.  I was told by Jennifer, just call us on Tuesday and we will hold the spots if you will commit, but unable to drop off payment.  Well, our Master card had unauthorized charges and a new card is being sent to us.  AB doesn't accept AE or Discover, and the manager denied that she said to call and she will hold the spots because they have a wait list now.  I told them my husband can walk from his building to their site and will pay tomorrow when the replacement card arrives.  However, we were given extension to 10 AM or they will give the spots away.   They even claimed that they have given us extension, which is a complete lie.  It is late and we are both working so we have to find camp for my children, we will not come back to this place next year.  The lack of consistency and integrity is tough to do business with.< /review>< Pics>

Excellent coaches , coach AJ is the best , and coach Cory is great.

I would rate 5 for the coaches -- super excellent. But rate negative 5 for the front desk .

Unfortunately the receptionist and the support staff is full of BS. Very, ineffective and horrible customer service . Especially the Asian elderly lady , Is so snobbish that she thinks she is running a charity. In fact charging through the nose !< /Review>

If you are looking for a gym to call home and plan to be there a long time this is NOT  the one!

My son broke his arm so I called from the hospital as a courtesy to the gym let them know my daughter would not make it to her class.  While I had them on the phone I decided to schedule her make up class without my calendar in front of me. I later realized I would be out of town at the time I scheduled her make up so I called back the next day, the day BEFORE her make up was scheduled and they would not let me reschedule it. I had my own gymnastics program in AZ and this is the most ridiculous policy I've ever heard.  It's not like we missed our make up class and are trying to make up our make up!  I was essentially going to slide into a class in an hour that still had openings and open up room for the next day.  They kept telling me that they were saving a spot for me so IF someone called to do their make up then would have already told them no.  My thought was that it hasn't happened yet, so IF someone calls they could give it to them.  So sad they are willing to lose customer over not letting them attend a different make up ahead of time when there was room in both classes! I am withdrawing my daughter from the program.  When looking for a gym, we are essentially looking for a home.  We literally just paid and registration fee last week, attended one class and they won't refund our $50 registration fee either. They are clearly a money driven program and have terrible customer services.  The manager also told me there IS flexibility to this policy given the circumstance, but MY circumstance wasn't one of those.  When I asked to speak to the owner he told me she would just be referring me back to him since he was in charge of the recreation dept.</Text>

Wow. What a shock. I found myself quite surprised by the people who work here. My daughter likes her teacher but when I had a question about my bill the front desk woman was snappy and then the owner came out (I think her name was Mel ?) basically threw the bill in my face and said "that's the price. Take it or leave it" and then walked away. And this is only our first month here! We're going somewhere else, thank you</review>

<name>Alicia Garcia< /name><review>With the loss of their best team coaches Justin Howell and Liz Crandall, the team coaching is stretched among "the leftover coaches" who are verbally abusive and the owner who appears to not even want to be out on the floor.  If you think your daughter will go into team here, get ready for her to come home in tears.  In my opinion, they are less interested in coaching girls with promise than waiting for the "already gifted" girls to walk in to door to maintain their gym's credibility.  The recreation side of the house builds girls confidence up but the team side leaves girls mentally battered and even scarred for life.<//review>< time>

< Review>
My daughter went there for 1 year in the Dynamos class and I have nothing substantial to see as a result. Not even a flip or a head stand, forget cart wheel. There are more than 15 kids in each class and the instructors are busy dealing with them turn after turn, so there is a lot of waiting involved which becomes boring and frustrating for the kids. They have loopholes for scheduling makeups and changing the time of the class is a long wait too.<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1617915333319, 'text': 'Hey Mitchell;\nThanks you for your review. It definitely seems like our team didn\'t quite explain the online check in system when you arrived at the shop. People are allowed to check in online ahead of their visit to the store, it\'s kind of like a queue, so sometimes that can seem like "walkins" are coming in when it\'s someone who has checked in. I\'m not saying that is what happened, but it has been a point of confusion. Needless to say we clearly didn\'t take you when the system said we should have and I am sorry for that. We are working on the system\'s wait time configuration and have some updates coming out in the coming months. We\'ve also updated our iOS app to automatically check you into the store once you arrive.\nAs for the cost: We aim to pay our people a wage that works for them while staying current with our landlord.\n\nIf you have anything else you\'d like to discuss I invite you to email me at Spencer@scjm.solutions'}</response><Review>My haircut was good, but the hassle and price were not worth it.  Online sign in system makes no sense, as they still allow walk ins to jump ahead in line until you arrive.  I signed in online and they told me to arrive an hour later.  I arrive at that time only to find out they let 3 walk ins join the list a few minutes earlier and now I have to wait for all 3 to get haircuts.  It ends up being an extra 40 minute wait.  Why even bother signing in ahead of time if the walk ins get to jump the line?

Even if you only want a haircut, they still charge for the full package (shampooing, massage, etc.) making it quite expensive. Expect to pay $27 before tip, no matter what you're going in for. If you just want a haircut, you're better off finding a local barber and paying half that.< /Review>< username>

Great staff and friendly service! I always come here to get my haircut because I’ve always had the best luck here. The only thing I am confused about is why is the MVP pass $150 if I still have to pay around $30 per haircut after getting the pass? Seems like highway robbery...<//Text>

<name>Eduardo Vargas<//name><UserId.>100441441247940692118<//UserId.><Text>I just got my haircut here a few minutes ago. I usually go to a barber but he is unavailable for about 3 weeks and I desperately needed a haircut, so I bit the bullet. I understand that sport clips is very much a basic shop so I expected to receive a bare bones haircut that still managed to reduce length properly. What I got what uneven L & R sides, a back that was not sharply cut down the the skin, and a refusal to do even the most basic of lineups (I ended up just requesting them to “define the  edges” which I don’t even know did anything.)The issue here is the large corporate atmosphere. Considering the price, $30, I am not surprised at the quality of clippers, length of time it took to cut, or experience of the stylists. The stylist switched between open and closed clippers at a rate that was so irregular that even after requesting a simple number cut (I quickly realized after walking in that a fade would not be possible and just requested a 3 on all sides) I got an uneven haircut. She went with, against, and along the grain in inconsistent ways and overall it’s a genuine hack job. I also think that there is a lot of worthless additives to this place. I had my hair washed and they had massaging chairs... ok. Let’s work on giving good haircuts before we add things like that. I also got a mechanical massage afterwards which was so wildly unnecessary and cheap that I was genuinely dumbfounded it was going on. I don’t blame my stylist as it seems like this is a lack of experience/ability to improve (largely from the high rate at which it looks this place has to cut hair) and an overall low quality of materials. This is a good place to go if you want to shave your head but other than that I could never recommend someone to sport clips. Looking for hats/beanies currently.</Text>< Pics>

The haircut I got was nothing close to the picture I showed. The length of my hair on top is uneven. The hairdresser was in a hurry. My hair is much shorter than I anticipated it to be.

I wouldn’t recommend this place for a haircut at all.</Review>

I had never been to this barbershop before, but since it was nearby, I thought I'd try it out. I set an appointment for 2:14 PM, and got there at 2:10. After checking in, I was told to wait for an extra 10 minutes. The shop wasn't too crowded, and though there was a line, I was supposed to be first.

Out of respect for the barbers, I waited outside patiently alongside the people behind me. It was very hot outside, but I tolerated the heat because I really wanted to give this place a chance. In the end, they left me waiting for over half an hour, without any updates or apologizes. It was past 2:50 when I received a notification saying that my barber was ready, but by then it was too little too late, as I had left in frustration at 2:47.

I found this establishment to be unprofessional, and after reviewing the menu, I saw that its prices were higher than its competitors. After leaving this shop, I went to another hair saloon in the area, which gave me faster service for a better price.< /Review>

I had an extremely pleasant first-time visit at Sports Clips Haircuts of La Jolla.  Marlin had a keen sense-of-humor and was professional, soft-spoken, calm and friendly, vital traits for a relaxing experience.  Meticulously, she hooked me up with an awesome mid skin-fade and top trim!  Moreover, as a first-timer, you’ll receive the “MVP” package, soooo...relaxing!  Regarding COVID safety precautions, the staff and customers are masked, and equipments are sanitized.  Respectfully, they permit military and first-responder discounts.  Very pleasurable experience!  If you’re needing a cut, in President Trump’s words, “Try it!  You've got nothing to lose, [the services] it’ll be a gift from heaven” 😜</text>

<Text>Arrived in here on a Saturday morning with no wait. Stepped right in to get a haircut. Haircut was good as stylist gave me exactly what I asked for. Got the MVP treatment which includes shampoo and shoulder message. Probably would have just preferred the haircut only but was something different I usually wouldn’t get.
Great place, I will try to return when I’m in the area.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

They had great service and paid attention to detail. The products they used were amazing as well as the shower experience. They offered recommendations as to what kind of cut would be best for the style of my hair. Would definitely recommend for everyone to go and see for yourself!<//text>

Very thankful about being able to get a haircut after this Covid issue, any the hairdresser did a great job.......however the requirement for masks to be worn and no blow dryers was ridiculous. Masks are proven to do absolutely nothing to protect anyone from this virus, totally ridiculous that you cant use the blow dryers either, this makes no sense! It is common knowledge that any temperature over 105 degrees actually kills viruses. Its time for people to make a stand against these degrading , unsensical mandates put forth by the county of san diego. Actually the county supervisor who mandates this is being sued now for they are  unconstitutional. I have a medical exemption as well from wearing the mask, but they wanted to deny service if I did not completely cover. Its time to stand up against this Garbage.<//review>

<review>The booking experience is utterly poor. I tried checking in through the app but it doesn't let me. I just get an error with a message - You are already in the waiting list for another store. I don't know how that's possible, even though I've never checked in before this. Then I tried calling them but they don't pick up. I wanted to have a haircut at this place but how would I if they don't let me book.< /review><resp>{'time': 1591037439237, 'text': 'Hi There.

Professional hair cuts people take the time with you and do amazing work. Massage and hot towels were a nice bonus. I do wish the prices were maybe $15 for a haircut and $20 mvp instead of the current pricing though as it’s pricey for men who don’t have a lot of hair to begin with typically. Will absolutely go back when my budget allows maybe every other or every 3rd month. Really like that a trim around neck and ears doesn’t cost extra when returning.<//text>

<text>Our stylist was VERY patient and sweet with my wild and crazy 3 year old.  My son loves getting his hair cut and these days loves goofing around in front of the mirror.  So much, in fact, that he nearly fell out of his chair multiple times during his haircut. Our stylist worked very well with him and got through the haircut. It even turned out symmetric!</text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<rating>4< /rating><review>First-timer here. The haircut is great and it’s a style I’ve never had before so I like it. My stylist was able to take my jumbled ideas and make something out of it. This was the most expensive haircut I’ve ever paid for so my expectations were a bit higher than usual. That said, my stylist wasn’t quite as thorough as she could have been, being that there were a few longer hairs sticking out on my neck and side burns and I watched another stylist working very diligently with another guest, who had beard treatment so he may have paid more. She did tell me about the guarantee, however, so I’ll use it soon. Unfortunately that means an extra visit. The mvp treatment was great but I’ll save the extra few bucks next time. I just don’t love the head massage, personally. The way they set up the queue is cool but all the stylists could be louder calling out names and directing more attention to the big screen where the queue is listed. There are people of all ages present with different hearing abilities that couldn’t hear them. All that said, I will definitely be back unless I find something else.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Not a good haircut but I'm not sure what I expected for 25 bucks. They started rushing once more people started coming in. Asked me 3 times if I wanted to upgrade to pay more. I had to have my girlfriend fix my hair with my beard trimmer when I got home.</Review>

I’ve been coming to this place for the last 6 years nonstop. Haven’t found a better haircut or friendlier stylists anywhere else. They treat you great and they make you feel at home. You may think you’re coming for a haircut but it’s the smiling faces and great stories that make it more. Be sure to say hi to loann!<//Review>

The staff are super friendly and do a great job making you feel welcome. The MVP was a little overrated, as first customers me and my partner got the "double" for free which means extra time for face and shoulder massage, and hot towel. Massages literally lasted ten seconds, hot towels were nice. Also haircuts were average, I got a better one than my partner who had some rough finishes. Overall would give the staff friendliess an A+, but the value for money and haircut expertise level a 5/10. Thank you!</Text>

I usually take my boys to our regular barber shop. Been going there for years. My older son decided he wanted to grow out his luscious locks. I took him in for a trim and the barber BUTCHERED his hair. I am not even exaggerating. Out of desperation, I sought out a place to fix the disaster that was my son’s hair.

I was referred to Sport Clips by a co-worker. I was turned onto the app. Coooooool app. I was able to check-in before I left work as he wait was 69 minutes. I picked my son up and went to Sport Clips. We were seated 13 minutes ahead of schedule!

Marlin was an angel on Earth. My son received the MVP treatment to include a back massage, hot towel facial and shampoo. He loved his haircut!!! This was huge as my son is autistic and he felt as though he lost his identity when his hair was destroyed. Thank you, Marlin, for the restored confidence. I recommend this place five stars over and it has now become our regular go-to barber shop!< /text>

<text>TL;DR: One of the worst barbershops I have visited in the past 4 years. Could not complete my simple haircut, left the hair on the back of my head uneven lengths and sticking out(I requested a 1). Avoid unless you have no choice.

My barber 1. Did not understand my instructions(3/4 inch off the top, tight fade from 1-1.5) 2. Did not cut according to how I EXPLICITLY told her to 3. Left me feeling less groomed than I did before I came in. (Back of my head is a mess). 4. Cut my hair much too short and when asked to cut the side shorter to make it less pronounced, she proceeded to cut more off the top. Unbelievable.

I’ve gotten the same haircut for 4 years around the country and received one of the worst haircuts yesterday. For almost 30$ I feel robbed. I didn’t like how tips started at 5$. I had to use office scissors to emergency fix a patch of hair that was long and stuck out the side of my head before my job interview.< /text>< Pics>

I'm originally from New York and it's hard to find a good cut in San Diego. I have been visiting sports clips 4 many years to see Henry. Henry is extremely professional and overall hooks up a nice fade. If you're looking for a good cut go to sports clips and ask for Henry. You will not be disappointed.< /Review>

Walking into SportClips, I was really nervous because it was my first time getting a haircut since moving in to UCSD. For months, I’ve been trying to figure out where I should get my haircuts from now on. I found SportsClips to be the top rated on Google and the nearest. I’ve always gotten my haircuts from a local barbershop and chain barbershops always made me a little iffy, but after going to SportClips, I’ve changed my mind. My haircut was just as good as my previous barber, if not better. Marlin was very friendly and welcoming. She knew what I wanted and performed. She also offered some products after the haircut, but did not push me to purchase. UCSD students also get a discount! I’m definitely coming back to SportsClips each month.<//Text>

First time going, won't be going back. It was nice to have the upgraded package for the first time customers but the quality of the cut wasn't worth the price.

I asked for a skin fade and had to fix my own hair when I got home. Not sure if it was the stylist, but not too impressed.

If you want to be pampered with the shampoo and massage then go here but I wouldn't recommend the haircut.< /text>

Pretty straight forward. No gimmicks, good cut for the price. $23 for a male’s cut. Stylist was friendly and decent but did seem a bit rushed to get me out before they closed. Overall happy with the quality and cut. Not the best but not the worst either. Would have liked to see a little more attention for a $23 cut and a 25% tip too.< /Text>

Definitely the best place to get a haircut. Comfortable chairs, excellent cuts, friendly service, hot towels, and shampoo to cut down on the itchy hairs post-cut.

It's not cheap, but definitely cheaper than my wife's haircuts and about 1/8 the cost of my poodle's haircut (no, not at Sports Clips).</Text>

I was very hesitant because I thought sports clips sounded a little too “Dude-Bro” for me but I am a sports fan. And the regular person who cuts my hair has been disabled for a while so I needed a haircut. Got a coupon in a local coupon book for UC / La Jolla area so I figured I’d try it. I loved it. My usual haircut costs $40 but I paid only $15 with the coupon and got a hot towel treatment neck and shoulder massage and my hair stylist Kayla was fantastic! Even my wife said my haircut looked great.</text>

<review>Way overpriced, low quality haircuts from women who have no idea what they're doing.  They're open late so it's convenient, but Maricela absolutely butchered my hair.  She made some weird lines in the back of my hair, and I showed her where the fade lines were messed up. She told me my hair was thinning and that I have dry scalp, but she would fix it. Instead, she took the clippers all the way up to the crown of my head. I told her it looked bad, and again, she said it was because I have dry scalp that she moved the fade line up 2 inches. I also got to pay $29 for the privilege of this disaster. Go to a Korean or Arabic barber in Genessee and save $15 and get a much hair cut.<//review>< Rate>

< Review>
Nice haircut. Only reason I've not given them 5* is because I've only had my hair cut 3 times in the USA. Other 2 times were elsewhere and awful. Lady barber here was 1. really good 2. Could actually cut hair, and 3. Was diligent.<//Review>

That was awesome. I sort of found this place by accident and I'm glad I did. First timers  get a free steam towel/wash treatment which was really nice. The haircut itself was good, I explained how I wanted it and she suggested some optimizations.</Text>

Your store and company is actually new to me as your stylist Kim is the reason I went there. She had cut my hair for over 10 years at Supercuts and up and quit last year early December. I found out where she went (your store) by reading some of the last reviews on her when she worked at Supercuts which were all rave reviews I might add. She just seems to cut my hair better than anyone else ever has and I am sure with her experience all of her customers would feel the same way. I have always felt after a haircut by her I look so much better than I did even if my hairstyle is still out of the 70's. Ask for Kim and you won't be disappointed.</Text>

The stylists are amazing and always remember a lot of detail that up may have shared on previous visits. My personal favorites are Lo’An and Audree.

<date>1365436671944< /date><Rate>2</Rate><review>I was extremely disappointed with my hair cut at this Sports Clips.  The lady that was cutting my hair was more interested in talking to me than giving me a good haircut.  My haircut was not complicated, simply involved a #3 on the sides and trimmed on the top with scissors.  The lady did an absolutely terrible job and I have never had a haircut that bad in my entire life.  When I returned home, I realized she missed hundreds of hairs with the buzzers and didn't even cut all of my hair on top to an even length.  I ended up having to take a pair of scissors and fix my hair myself.

I will NEVER go to a Sports Clips again.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

A terrible excuse of a fade and a cut on the right side of my neck and then they had the nerve not to take responsibility for cutting me with the clippers. I will be filing a formal complaint against them because this is not worth $20 dollars. The barber was named Mary and I again warn u not to go here.<//Text>< pictures>

We found your Client History in our computer system and noted that it was November 20, 2017, that you last visited our Sport Clips store in La Jolla, yet it's not until February 2018 that you post a 1-Star Review.  Why wait for 3 months to voice your displeasure, or did you post to the wrong business?  Any insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  What can we do better?  Thank you."}<//response>

I had a great experience at Central auto repair. The service manager Charlie, and his team of professional mechanics were able to diagnose and replace my alternator, and get me back on the road the same day, with an extremely quick turnaround. In addition, they were able to replace my brakes the very next day with another quick and painless turnaround. I highly recommend Central Auto Repair. They’re honest and dependable and they do great work.
Thanks again Central Auto Repair.
Kind regards,
Gary</text>

It was really important to have a reliable car for all my doctors appointments that i couldn't miss. After having bad experience with other mechanics, i went based on reviews what other customers have said about this place. Not only did it had great reviews but also had a positive environment. I turned over my keys to Charle to get an idea what's wrong with it. He was straight forward what needed to be done and was a fast worker especially his crew members. Once the problem was fixed, i never had to worry about it again or have any issues with it a week later. My car lasted with 300k miles till i finally bought another car. I have been coming here ever since for honest work and great expectations.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dc99c1e4671ce5:0xaf8d2202574177c0</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Most honest repair shop i have been to. Gave me very fair price. other shops wanted almost double. They also used original parts since aftermarket was around same price. That’s a big plus that they took the extra time to offer me great deal while using original parts. Quality work and very professional . Will definitely be back for any car repairs i need.<//review>< date>

<Text>They did something pretty good and went put of their way for me to get my car home so that was good, but the reason I took my car home was due to the price they tried to charge for the labor it took.

Very disappointed. I took it in for an alignment, they told me I needed new brake pads and rotors because it was metal on metal and that my front bearing was out. I already new my bearing was out and was headed to the dealership to see if it was covered by my warranty. My brake pads needed to be changed, they were at 20% but were not metal to metal and both rotors were not effected. Saved $596 by knowing what needed to be done instead of believing them. Do not go here, they had the opportunity to do the right thing, chose not to.< /text>

<Text>Worst shop I have ever used. The shop tried to fix a  smog sytem leak, two visits to Central, they reset the check engine light and left me with a broken smog system hose that I could not see. Charged me full cost for Toyota parts and used cheap knockoff parts. I drove directly to another shop where they fixed it the first time. I contacted the California Bureau of Automotive Repair and got a partial refund. Reviews are fake, shop is a ripoff.</Text>< Pictures>

If you value your vehicle make sure to stay away from this place. the owner charlie knows nothing about cars. installed my parts upside down , and caused 5k in damages and refused to pay for them. they have no experience in the automotive field. I wish i could give zero stars. STAY AWAY< /review>

<review>Let me start my review by saying that this Central auto repair shop could’ve had me or my family seriously injured or even killed because of their incompetent repair work.  Please do not take your vehicle here.  Further more they neglected to take responsibility nor pay for the repair work that I had to have redone at the dealership because of this incompetence.  They cost me $1800 dollars in repairs (1/2 of which were for unnecessary parts  installed by there mechanics that didn't fix the problem and labor ), A Triple A call, A dented and scratched rim ( not included in the 1800 dollars that I paid in repairs)  and almost caused a serious accident because they used after market parts and neglected to put the correct bolt on my braking system!

My husband took my 2013 ford edge to Central Auto Repair because the breaks were giving off a burnt odor as we were coming down the mountain from arrowhead.  This was March 7th 2019.  They had the car 2 days and said that problem was the front brake pads and calibers.  We paid $423.00 dollars and got them fixed.  However, after about 2 days of driving the vehicle I noticed the burnt smell had returned and the vehicle was becoming more increasing difficult to stop.  It began making a sound and the pedal was very mushy.    My husband returned the car to Central Auto Repair and they kept the vehicle until April 17th 2019 because they were having difficulty determining what the problem was.  When my husband picked up the vehicle this time, we were charged $792.00 because they said they had to replace the ABS unit, the break booster, break booster vacuum hose and the master cylinder.   When we received the vehicle, the burnt smell was gone but all of the dashboard indicator lights were on.  When my husband asked Central Auto Repair to reprogram the computer to remove them.  They explained they did not have the proper computer equipment to do so.  We then had to take the vehicle to the Ford dealership for reprogramming.  The dealership charged us an additional $240.00 do a diagnostic and reprogram.  They also informed us that my computer was wiped of pertinent information such as my VIN number.  Then on June 14th as I began to exit the freeway, what I thought was my ABS system automatically locking my brakes was actually the brake caliber bolt dislodging.   This caused the front half of caliber to disconnect and fall. This caused the caliber to grind and scratch the inside of the rim of the vehicle.   I struggled to get the vehicle to moved forward which caused the vehicle to violently jerk forward almost causing me to nearly ram the vehicle in front of me.  I had to have my vehicle towed from riverside to lake Elsinore ford.   The dealership found that the break caliber bolt was not properly tightened causing it to vibrate lose and fall out.  We then paid another $268. dollars to replace the caliber and the bolts and inspect the other side to ensure the others were not compromised.   We went to Central Auto Repair and explained that the ford dealership informed us that Central Auto Repair’s mechanic did not tighten or possibly put the wrong bolt on the caliber.  We showed the owner pictures of the damaged rim and the bolt missing.  The owner refused to accept responsibility and placed blame on the Ford Dealership.  He became upset and refused to compensate in any kind of way.   The service manager of the Ford Dealership even called to explain the action that caused the damage and the owner became even more upset and hung up in her face.  ****** In Ford's diagnostic report they stated that they did not understand why all of the braking system parts were replaced if the only thing that was wrong with the vehicle was the brake booster and the master cylinder.  Furthermore, if they didn't have the equipment to reprogram the computer then they didn't have the proper equipment to diagnose my vehicle causing unnecessary repairs and added costs!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

A great shopping experience. The sales person Robert was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed to make a decision. The installers were great. They kept me notified of my delivery schedule and even came earlier. Very happy I went to this store.<//review>

<review>I had my kitchen remodeled and I suddenly needed new appliances ASAP.  At other home-improvement stores I would have to wait three weeks for them to be in stock and the prices were higher. At Howard’s. I was able to find what I needed in stock and have them delivered next day.. All of the associates were very helpful<//review>< user>

We recently purchased a Dishwasher through Howards Appliance in Corona CA.  From start to finish we had outstanding service!  Paul Karandos, the gentleman who helped us, was fantastic.  Paul's knowledge about the products and his suggestions and input about what he felt would be best for us, where extremely helpful.  Our delivery and installation arrived promptly and Jerry, our installer did an amazing job.  Thank you Paul for all your help...and even though all our negotiations were done over the phone we are so happy and pleased with all your advice.  Thank you so much.< /Review>

Bob was great! Honest and helpful. Bob didn’t throw any sales pitch towards my husband & I. Bob, allowed us to actually shop and make decisions without any pressure. We purchased a fridge, washer, and dryer and even though bob was closing he made sure not to rush us and showed us ways to get additional discounts!

This was my 2nd time visiting Howard’s. I went to one in Irvine and some dude name Jacob was a terrible sales guy! Jacob told us delivery & install would be $175, while Bob said delivery is free! We already decided on a fridge and the final 30 mins we were debating on a washer and dryer... long story short he started bashing on every brand expect the one HE wanted and pressured us to purchase the one HE thought was best. When I told him to give my husband and I a few mins to decided he got upset and said “we’re closed”.< /Text>

Update 9/14: Replacement finally arrived and working. Added 1 star. Still unlikely to shop there again.
New GE microwave delivered Fri 8:30AM, Later that day, unboxed and plugged in to test and found the display was all screwed up like a test pattern. Nothing worked. Ugg! but glad I checked before permanently installing. Called store, was told must call GE and troubleshoot first. Call back Monday with test results when the mgr 'Albert' is working as only he can authorize a replacement. Likely GE's not working on weekends either. Took a chance with Howard's, usually buy from Lowe's, Home Depot or Amazon where replacement is never a problem - especially on day 1! They take responsibility - not pawn it off. Should have paid more attention to the reviews</Text>

Their website said the refrigerator was on sale. I was excited. I called and asked if they could deliver. They said no we're out of stock it will be two weeks before we can provide that refrigerator. Home Depot here I come!</Review>

<Review>Brought a LG refrigerator on April 27 told it would be in on May 1 and delivered on May 2, waited until May 1 called no refrigerator until May 14 . Cancelled the order as we needed refrigerator right away as old one was not working.  Said they would cancel the order and refund money.  Called today May 5 order still not cancelled and no money refunded.  Called customer service said they said they would work on it.  Also in the process of all this I have dealt with three different salespeople and each had different answers.  I will never do business with company again nor recommend them.  We have gone elsewhere for our refrigerator and already have it installed.</Review><user_name>Alton Vance</user_name><resp>{'time': 1588783980193, 'text': 'Hi Alton, thank you for sharing your experience with us.

It's been a month since I ordered my fridge, and nobody has given me a call or called me back regarding my item. So I'm sitting here with my fridge about ready to go out. I have no delivery date or anything. Very disappointed! The lack of communication is ridiculous.</Review>

When it comes to customer service I'd give them a 0.

My grandmother purchased a stove, microwave, and refrigerator from the company in March of 2019. Since the purchase we have had to call 3 separate times for repairs. When we asked to exchange the product for a new one they refused and said 4 maintenance calls have to be called in before a repair. Due to this my grandparents were unable to cook thanksgiving dinner and a Christmas dinner. Keep in mind that we had explained to them that my grandfather has severe Alzheimer's and is in home hospice so we were unable to take them to a family's house for dinner. There was no sympathy shown by the company or employees. I am on the board of chambers for a few city's and will be letting the other board members know about the horrible customer service your company provides.<//text>

<Text>I was really happy with the way we were  helped  at Corona Howard's. I had a problem with the trucking company they sent first to deliver our refrigerator. We not any help.
I called  the salesperson he said he take care of it. The next day they sent a different trucking company
If I was Jowards I would only use
Nathan's team . OMAR & OSCAR
Was very helpful and agreeable to get the job. Which they did very professionally.

The salesman was great but the delivery guys not so much. I bought a washing machine and did all the work prior to their visit. All they had to do was hook it up. They didn’t want to do it and when they did it was a bad job and leaked. After they left I rebooked it up and no leaks. They weren’t very nice and were really rushed.<//text>

Edit to post 5/29/19
The original delivery guys showed up on Memorial Day 5/27/19. We had little choice as they tell you when the can come and a time frame, which happened to be 3:00pm -5:00pm. We had bought West Coast Thunder ride and concert tickets well before our purchase. So we decided to not go to the concert.

The men show up around 3:00pm. They tell me they have 14 deliveries on the Holiday, so I run out for 40.00 tip to give each 20.00. They were supposed to do the set up, which included Fridge door alignment and water for Ice maker, and washer and dryer.

Long story short, they did not turn on the water for Fridge , or align doors. Nor did they make sure the washer and dryer were working properly.  The dryer igniter was faulty and would not hear the clothes. Called the following day..they send out crew 2 to check what crew 1 should have got right. Yep dryer defective, no parts to replace. Do not buy from Howards.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>I admire this spot! They serve splendid meals, they have a nice menu, The chief cook in that spot is a real authority in the kitchen, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The dishes are always fresh and tasty, the service towards the customers  is very good too. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it to all.<//Text>< pictures>

This restaurant is the one I always prefer. I eat in plenty of restaurants but to this place I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very chummy and the cooking they cook is so fresh and tasty. I am always happy to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.</Review>

Stumbled upon Ten-Ichi this weekend with my friend, as we were strolling on Upper Fillmore, and I was CRAVING Japanese food. Turns out Ten-Ichi is Family owned and has been in business since the late 70's! We sat outside, they turned on a heat lamp for us, and we had a YUMMY meal of Miso soup, Sushi, Sashimi, Salmon Teriyaki (so good) and Tempura stuffed mushrooms (YUM). Reasonable pricing, good food, and good service. We will be back for sure.<//text>

I stopped here on my way to a show on a Thursday night around 6:15.I was in a hurry, but wanted to grab some good food while I was in the area. I sat down at their bar within 5-10 minutes and I was on my way 20 minutes after that! The quality of the fish was great and the flavors were great. It is suggested to eat the hand roll immediately after being served so you can crunch down on the seaweed, it really makes a difference! It is still fairly pricey though.</review>

We enjoy to go out. Yesterday we arrived in this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We passed a beautiful experience there with first-rate cooking and a well-trained stuff and  a professional chief cook. We  added this venue in our list  and we shall definitely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.<//text>

It was good, however nothing special about the handrolls. It's just like any other sushi spot. You can probably get tastier ones at your favorite spot with siracha & other sauce sides. They only offer soy sauce.  I personally won't be going back to downtown for this restaurant.< /review>

Hands down this place gets down w their rolls. U can pick and choose from the many type of fish they have. Not going to lie at first I was kinda picky cuz they are just wraps but in reality they pack a wallop. I will recommend to go as soon as they open since it's just a bar and it's very popular.. two thumbs up< /review>

Ten-Ichi Restaurant & Sushi Bar  is and will forever be my favorite place to eat haha. Still five stars BUT I'd like to thank the workers here for their good service :) I love the iced tea here & a worker offered to pack me two to go cups of iced tea so I can enjoy some while walking around LA! And the paper straws were a nice touch haha. Thank you for the always amazing meal Ten-Ichi Restaurant & Sushi Bar<//Text>

Best Omakase around that I’ve had. Some of the best roll combinations anywhere and wow, their iron and ramen is phenomenal. Maybe the best hidden secret of this place. 100% better than some of  the reviews make it seem.<//Review>

Waste of money, food was not fresh and a roll was 3 pieces or mostly rice. I know times a hard but that doesn't give the right to mislead customers. Shoulda read the reviews before ordering.< /text>

<Review>Our food was good but in a city with so much sushi, it did not stand out. The service was also okay, but our waiter wasn’t the most attentive. They did help celebrate my gf birthday by bringing a plate with sorbet and some strawberry’s which was nice, overall a good but not fantastic dining experience.< /Review>< rating>

<text>I've dined here many times because I live in the neighborhood. I so want to love this place because of the history and proximity, but the food quality is just not good and it's gotten worse each time. I'm Japanese and when I'm too lazy to go far or cook myself, I come here to seek comfort. Fish is not fresh. One time there was plastic wrap in my sushi. Today the udon was horrible, the outside mushy and falling apart while the inside was undercooked and chalky. The broth was palatable because it's probably a solid factory made concentrate. Tempura batter was overworked and chewy. It just seems like staff in the kitchen just don't care and have no clue what good Japanese food is supposed to taste like. The servers are kind and hard-working, but because they are understaffed, presumably due to decreased business, the service is slow and patchy. Fingers crossed that this place gets the right help it needs to update its menu and improve processes to get it right.< /text>< Pics>

the service was terrible. One person's meal was served more than 10 minutes after the first person's meal was served. We canceled an appetizer order when it was not delivered before the meals were provided. The food is below average and the price is above average. another sushi restaurant at 706 Sutter where the sushi is much better.</review>

<text>The decor is a bit outdated. We dined here for a date night dinner after work. They have a simple but tasty menu that you'd expect to find: the typical rolls and nigiri pieces that you would normally find at a Japanese/sushi restaurant. I think we felt that it was too expensive for what we ordered...but, then again it filled our need for sushi. And, it was low-key, which is sometimes what you need in a sushi place.<//text>< Pics>

Pretty good sashimi, reliable lunch selection, but there's something up in the kitchen. They have trouble getting orders right and out in a timely manner - several tables left waiting too long even on a recent slow day.< /Review>

Waited 45 minutes for meal; appetizer came after that. When asked how dinner was they were uninterested! Manager came to the table and basically yelled at us for expecting sushi dinners before one hour, which he stated was typical for a Sunday at 5:30. Totally awful place which is too bad b/c it is near the wonderful Clay Cinema on Fillmore.<//review>

<review>Tenichi has been my 'go-to' sushi spot in SF since I was young. I've always thought that it was pretty good, but they've made little changes to their menu to add some more creative items that are actually really good.

On top of that, I had a bit of an omakase situation there from the younger dude working there. (For those of you unfamiliar with Omakase, that's when you let the sushi chef do his thing...) It was also on point. More than just a standard sushi place when you let them do their thing.

Other than that, their fish is super fresh, and that's really the most important thing at the end of the day, but the standard stuff on the menu is just that.. pretty standard. Good, but standard.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Very bad japanese food. Since on fillmore, prices high, but I wouldn't eat here for free. Restaurant being empty should have been a clue.  Beef teriyaki was jerky-like and tuna was old. Definitely walk to japantown where at least the food is edible (but not great).<//Text>

Fallbrook Animal Sanctuary truly cares about every animal that comes through their doors. You can see it. You can feel it. And Darcy is the best of the best. Heart of gold that one. Highly recommended FAS to anyone in San Diego county!</text>

<Text>I do not understand why FAS does not have 5 stars. To me this is heaven in Fallbrook. By good value I mean they value the lives and care of animals no matter the cost. They feed the highest quality food. The volunteers are reliable and responsible. FAS is cleaned everyday. Laundry done everyday.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dc7ebb0b6bd8f7:0xa8f0abfe5aa216b7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I hadn't been here in a few years and tried to adopt a senior or disabled dog to buddy with my small dog that was just diagnosed with degenerative knee problems. Their shelter is totally closed due to Covid and the adoption fee seems to have skyrocketed, website said something like $300. I don't mind spring the great work rescue shelters do, but that seems a bit steep! Especially considered with other shelters. We have decided to try County animal services as the poor dogs  picked up off the streets etc seem much more in need.<//Review>

They all love those animals. Kat was amizing helping my 3 year old and I to find a cat that would be the best fit for us. We are very happy with the new family addition.<//Text>

<Response>None< /Response><text>I made him a ramp for the back porch so he can go into a private yard in the daytime.  He can not see it very well but he knows where it is. I have never regretted adopting Wally. He is almost 13 now.  The F.A.S.has some really cute dogs there. I just saw the most adorable weenie dog  there yesterday. Go see..........Just remember, no one can be sure of their age unless they came from the original owner.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Great shelter with wonderful staff. The cats and kittens are well socialized and friendly,affectionate.
Adoption fee is $50 and they have a special right now with 2 cats for $50. Kittens do well to have a best friend to play with.

All volunteer staff. When you are looking for your next pet, this place is well worth a visit.<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< date>

<review>I have been an animal behaviorist and dog trainer for 5 years and I have volunteered here working with dogs and also cleaning up after and loving on the cats.  We have adopted a cat from them and also borrowed a cat trap to catch a stray that was hit by a car.  Both kitties are happy and healthy.

The facility is clean and well organized and the people are friendly and willing to help those who are responsible pet owners and understand the value of a dog or cat as an important family member.
Small town rescue centers do their best with the little space and funding they have! They are not government funded like the SCPA so they need our help and support the most! I would recommend this place and urge you to give in whatever way you can.</review>< date>

< review>
Selected a kitten to adopt, but had to wait over 30 days to take her home due to her being so young.  During that time, I visited her several times a week, when I noticed the kitten and her litter mates starting to get ill.  After alerting both the staff and management several times over the course of a few days, nothing was done, except to send the kitten off to be spayed.  After a vet had supposedly signed off on her health, I picked her up 2 days later noting she had thick nasal discharge and partially closed eyes.

After bringing her home, she fell critically ill, unable to eat or stand without falling over.  When she worsened after a misdiagnosis at  Aloha Animal Hospital in Vista, I took her to the Veterinary Specialty Hospital in Escondido.  Barely able to breath and clinging to life, there she was diagnosed with life-threatening bacterial, viral and parasite infections so severe and contagous, she was placed in isolation where she received IV fluids, meds and hand feeding with a dropper.  Although the cost for all this was several thousand dollars, this sweet little kitten pulled through.

To my chagrin, I contracted several of the infections and almost died, requiring emergency medical care.  Not only that, but also my 5 other cats also became ill and are having to undergo treatment.

I found out from an insider at this rescue that the kitten's litter mates and mother were all quaranteened the very next day after I picked up the kitten.  Yet, I did not receive even so much as a courtesy call from them alerting me to the possibility of a problem.  So not only are they willfully negligent in failing to heed my warning of the cage of cats becoming ill, but they are were also not responsible enough to call and warn me there could potentially be a problem with my kitten.  In addition, they are culpable in the expenses and heartache I and my animals have had to endure as a result of what should have been a simple and straight forward adoption.

As an animal behaviorist specializing in positive training to help animals with issues, I was going to volunteer my services at this rescue to help with some of the long-time unadopted cats.  But after this incident, I'm not willing to set foot back in this place for fear of what I might catch next.

So animal lover's beware - not only are you risking the health of your current pets should you adopt an animal from here, the life at stake could very well be your own...</review>

Fallbrook Animal  Sanctuary  is an all volunteer organization, they do there best with the funds they get from donations only, no goverment or state help.
If not for them Fallbrook would have no animsl rescue and the animals would be left to fend for themselves.
Here they are taken care of physicaly, as well as spay/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped , health issues etc. Come visit, spend time with there beautiful animals.< /text>

<Text>I have yet to have a bad experience at this store. So many people have helped me here and I feel bad I'm not sharing all of their names, but Jeff was the most recent to prove great customer service still exists. I asked about a ladder that wasn't in stock and he offered to see if they could transfer it from another store. Within a day he called me back to let me know it had arrived and ready for me. Unless there's some odd reason, I never shop at a different store simply because the people there are so wonderful. Thank you to all of you!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>This place embodies why I moved to SLO over a decade ago.  Sure Miner's/ACE is a franchise but I challenge you to find another hardware store even another ACE where people are more interested in helping you.  If you don't go in there and get have someone there ask you if you need any help, you may want to check a mirror to see if you're invisible.  That open-hearted way embodies the spirit up here but it's concentrated in Miners.  I've bought more tools, odds and ends than I can count there. I bought my Weber Grill there. All of my garden is from sprouts I purchased there.  I've gotten an insane amount of gardening advice from them.  I once had a guy help me find a pluming fitting for the better part of 40 minutes.  This particular ACE is full of interesting and strange character that I love, some of it in structures I'm pretty sure are well over 100 years old and may have at one time been a residence in their former life.  But again, it's the people in this store that keep me coming back.  5 Stars, well earned.< /Review>< Pics>

Overall a good experience, a couple grouchy characters. You'll know when you are in there and come across them. Most staff is helpful and cashiers kind and courteous.< /Review>

It's like a friendly corner Hardware place, but grown out of the barn, so they built other buildings, and it's sort of this adventure of "the wood is in the barn, the plumbing is in this other building, paints are over there, and plants are this jungle connecting them all together. Definitely a bit overwhelming, but lots of friendly people to guide you to your next item. Will definitely be a regular.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1611161751289, 'text': 'Dave this is an awesome description, we love it!

Really friendly customer service and they have what I need about 80% of the time. Parking is kind of a mess nowadays but definitely better than going to the giant box stores for small to medium size projects.< /review>

Another person walked me to the tack cloths I needed and a wonderful young lady carried 2 big bags of bird seed I impulse-bought. Not only to the cash register...but to my car. Wish I lived closer...I would go here a lot!<//Review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Asked a young employee, Bohde, what I needed to clear clogged drain in my RV sink. He said plumbing wasn't his area of expertise, but instead of just directing me to the plumbing section he showed me the way, pointed out Mark, a plumbing expert, and stayed with us while Mark asked me some questions  about my sink and the stoppage to help him decide what would work best for me from among Miner's incredible array of drain-clearing supplies (gels, plungers, metal snakes, etc). Mark then recommended an inexpensive Drano gel, which worked perfectly.

These guys were definitely "on my side", treating me with my $5.00 problem as if I were spending $500. I sure know where to go in the future whenever I need some hardware.<//text>< userid>

<text>This is my favorite hardware store in the area although it is really set up for non-professional customers. For multiple quick trips each week, it can be frustrating to get through the narrow aisles stacked with stuff and lingering employees in personal conversations. But they still have better selection and stock than the box store. And it is still usually quicker even with the frustrations. I should not have previously posted a negative review from the parking lot after a bad trip. Sorry.<//text>< user>

One of my favorite places to shop. Beautiful plants and trees, overall great help. If one employee doesn't have an answer, that person will choose an employee who does. If it concerns a plant or tree, they will check an encyclopedia for answers.</review>

Miner’s prices tend to be slightly higher than the big box stores.  But you may actually save money and time. They usually have just what you need—even if you aren’t sure what it is—will help you find it, explain how it’s used, and/or explain how to install it. Over the years, this great service has saved me money, frustration, and multiple return trips. Even though the store is smaller than the Depot, in some areas like hardware their selection is actually larger. Highly recommended.</Text>

<text>Every time I visit Miner's is a pleasure. They certainly don't always have what I am looking for, but for their size, they are wonderful. Their garden department is really good, and I love that they work with a local charity, Transitions Mental Health Association, to get many of their native plants. They do good things in our community, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.< /text>< pictures>

We shop at miners all the time. They are a great local hardware store and are generally is competitively priced as an independent operator can be.
They have a full selection of nuts and bolts including grade 8 hardware and many other metric and Specialty Fasteners that will be hard to find anywhere else in town.
If you compare their prices to Fastenal it will seem like a cheap date.
We are lucky to have minors in town for if we didn't have them we would only have Home Depot.< /Review>

<Review>These guys always have what you need, but several employees I spoke to over the weekend in the irrigation department could not help me find what I needed, and seemed to lack any experience in irrigation, I had to look myself until I found what I needed. Additionally, my wife made a trip over to purchase a couple of 3-inch ABS Coupler slip/slip, and slip/threaded, and clean-out cap, and a 7-inch long cut piece if 3-inch ABS Pipe. You would not believe the assortment of odd item the employee picked out for my wife, then he argued with my wife about cutting the pipe.<//Review>< gmapID>

Visiting from out of town.  What a great place! Very helpful staff... Didn't have to look for help, they found me (several times) to ask what help I needed.</Text>

This is a very nice hardware store as well as Garden Supply Center. The people are older and knowledgeable and very helpful. They have a wide selection decent prices and if you buy bulk Goods you can pay for them and they will load them right in your car. This is a great place to come for your Hardware needs especially if you need help deciding on something.<//Text>

My husband and I always love shopping here. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable- if they don't have an answer, they'll find someone who does! Whether it's sage planting advice or plumbing tips and tricks, these guys have what it takes or know where to find it. Loyal for life- SLO branch!<//Text>

<time>1413049669025<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I love this place. Pretty sure it's the layout, staff and pricing. I've never once had a bad encounter with a staff member, they are all super friendly and no matter what random project you're working on, someone there can explain it and tell you the tools you will need. There's a total plant nerd that works there (and I mean that as the highest compliment) and she can tell you anything about any plant anywhere, and what care to give them - plus free popcorn, it's just the greatest hardware store ever!<//review>< Pics>

Attention! Subject to update - We had some keys made here and they didn't work. Okay not the biggest issue, kind of annoying to go back but that's okay, they were very helpful. Second time going in we were guaranteed the keys would work, they even gave us an extra (they still didn't work, extra key didn't even fit in hole) So for the third trip to the store I really hope we get this taken care of properly, I will definitely update this rating to reflect the typical 5 star experience we have there!<//Review>

<review>I went to Ace for their paint department with a picture of the color I wanted for my living room. Their staff was kind enough to spend the better part of an hour helping me find the exact color. They even went through their old color books with me and handpicked my living room color! They went way above and beyond in customer service and because of that I'll never go anywhere else.</review>< Pics>

I am a frequent patron here.Sometimes I'm at Ace 3 or 4 times a week due to my profession.They usually have what I'm looking for and have great customer service.They save me a lot of time by not having to go to the Home Depot where service is almost  non- existant.</review>

A bit lackluster...I usually shop at the Los Osos or Morro Bay Miners, both of which offer superb customer service. After paying at checkout and being told someone would load the potting soil for me, I waited by the gate and....nobody.  I opened the garden center gate and after looking for help for several minutes further, I finally loaded my bags of potting soil onto a cart and wheeled it to my car; I never did see anybody to help. Very odd. Good thing I am an honest person.</Text>

I just had the most delightful shopping experience at Miner's Ace Hardware in San Luis Obispo.  Kevin in the lumber section was most helpful -- he offered suggestions for completing a project that I was working on, cut the lumber that I needed, and loaded it in my car -- all with a smile on his face, and most excellent manners.  To the owners of Ace Hardware in San Luis Obispo -- you have a wonderful staff, but I just have to let you know that Kevin deserves recognition for the way he treats your customers!  GREAT JOB KEVIN!  and Thank you!<//text>

I went there yesterday and their plants were so dehydrated they were dying. I actually found a watering can and tried to save some of the worst. I was so disappointed to see such neglect! There were literally dried up dead houseplants and outdoor plants. Needless to say I didn't buy anything. I hope this review will lead to some changes in the garden department</Review>

I used to frequent this location when I lived in the area and after they remodeled everything seem to change. They have a sign that clearly states that sleeveless tops are only $1.99 however every time I go to the front to purchase them they try to tell me that they’re $3.99 I realize that this isn’t a huge difference but when their sign is incorrect and then they come to the front and try to tell you that your miss reading the sign even though you see the sign, you have a picture of the sign, and it clearly states that all sleeveless blouses are $1.99 it’s really frustrating. The manager kept trying to tell me that the $1.99 price was only for spaghetti strap tank tops but the sign says sleeveless, it doesn’t say tank top. Also if it were the case why would the tank tops and the thicker strap tank tops be mixed in together if they were separate prices.  This didn’t just happened to me the woman behind me also had the same issue so it’s not a single issue with a single person but a continual issue that the store is not dealing with. Also I have been mistakenly charge double for a pair of shoes twice at this location and every time that I’ve gone back to try and fix it (literally walking to my car, realizing what happen and walking back in, less than 2 mins later) they won’t do anything about it because they say that they don’t know for sure that I didn’t purchase two pairs of shoes. I don’t typically leave reviews about places but I just feel like the way that they run this specific location is outrageous I really think that someone needs to come in from corporate and either correct the signs that are misleading or they need to actually follow through with what the sign says it’s not that hard.</Review>

A lot of great stuff and nicely organized. Staff is NOT friendly ir helpful. Prices are way too high for used items. Most items are priced as if new including items you can get at a dollar store. I realize the money goes towards a good cause (you hope it does). So if you don't mind over paying then its fine.</text>

Good prices. I went in recently on a Sunday, and nearly everything in the store was 50% off the already low prices. Huge store with lots of inventory to wade through, sometimes too much. The staff members work hard and they're very polite.< /Text>

<Text>When it's easier to throw quality items in the dump rather then donate them you realize that we live in a failed society. I scheduled a pickup a month in advance as I am moving cross country and cannot bring everything. The day of the pickup the driver is three hours late. Then I receive a call that the driver could not find a place to park and left after 5 minutes. There was clearly parking all around my apartment and drivers regularly park on the street if needed. The could not even reschedule for the following day. I have no doubt that the lazy drivers looked at the list of items and decided that they much rather move on. Now I am stuck with this stuff and am leaving tomorrow. What a joke.</Text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Extremely poor service.  I had a very nice clean couch that they scheduled a pick up.  We had to make special arrangement to move it up a long driveway the day before.  They stopped by and then went on and did not pick it up.  It was in excellent condition.  Now we have to move it back again down the driveway.  Their excust was that there was a stain on the couch.  I have relooked at the entire couch and every cushion and there is no stain.  What a pain for a donation that would have brought the Salvation Army several hundred dollars.  Too bad for them and for us.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This use to be the Salvation Army store, but now it’s Goodwill. I don’t like Goodwill because only a small portion of donations go to the needy. Most goes to administrative costs.< /Review>< Pics>

UPDATE: My thoughts are still the same, but wanted to note that Hall Closet in Martinez has been a great option for REAL deals.

Outrageous prices for clothes that are often stained, have holes, or are from Walmart in the first place. The sales on specific color tags are not great, and paired with the prices, don’t make it worth it to go through extensive racks of clothes.
If you’re a person new to secondhand shopping, this place is a great place to start. However, for those of us who have shopped here for years and watched the prices creep up, I cannot say the same.
Large selection and relatively well organized, but way overpriced. Will not be donating or shopping here any longer, if the prices are going to be a rip off.< /Review>

This place does not have thrift store prices! I do go in there to find things I cant find other places, but you rarely find a deal. For instance I've seen things at the dollars store there for more than a dollar. That should give you an idea on how they price things. It was a Saturday and so busy I nearly made my son late for work trying to pay for my 3 items. I guess because there isn't much competition in this area people flock to this place. Not worth it some days at all! Smh!!</Review>

I do know what happened to this location??. Before remodeling the place it was nice place to visit... Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
However now all change. Rude, very unprofessional staff..
Do not recommend..</review>

<Review>This McDonald's has gotten better over the years, so I am upping it to 3 stars.  I like McDonalds for fast food, but this one is either slow or inaccurate 75% of my visits.   I think they are on a 2 visit streak at the moment (of getting our order right), if they make it to 5 I will add a star :)< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

So this is what galena. We were ordering and she said only cash, so we said we only carrying cash so it's good. 20 seconds of silence then she said is cash ok because that's all we are accepting so we said YES that's all we are carrying. And another silence then she said go ahead with your order. I had a coupon so I order mine and when I finished my order she didn't said anything for like 30 seconds then said my first part of the order, so I kindly repeated the whole thing again and she silent AGAIN. I said did you get that and she said can you repeat the order so I did and guess what "Silent" Again. So after me and my friend order I told her I got a coupon and after the other silent she said ok pull ahead to the window. When we pulled to the second window she was leaning to the whatever machine it was she was texting and not doing anything. After like 5 minutes she start typing in the computer and said the pro e, so I mention I got a coupon and she said we cant accept that because the machine is not working, so I said how you know the price and she just left, when she came back I said just take my stuff out and charge my friend so she left to probably tell the one pitting the order together and she came back to charge my friend. When she came back with the change I asked her can you please give me a receipt. And she said no we can't because our computers are not working, so I asked then how can you charge people if you can't even give a receipt, and when gave the food to my friend roodly and said have a good night.</review>

I took off 1 star for every time they ignored me(4 different visits) , i love how the employees see you and run back in the kitchen like they never saw you.
They take turns to see who’s there and they hop back like a bunny 😂<//text>

This chain of restaurants is not too cozy. No interpersonal exchange at all. Just feel like a number and in the way at that. They make people feel unimportant and their guests embarrassed by the situation. McDonalds I grew up thinking you were special for our special family times but now I just don't know. I have not sent camping for a long time but great for a quickie bite.</review>

<Review>This place has extremely rude employees that never get my order correctly. This location also doesn't offer breakfast after 10:30am and never mind you sat there waiting for someone to take your order for over 5 minutes and 2 minutes after 10:30 am they say, I'm sorry, but we are no longer serving breakfast. 😶<//Review>< gmap_id>

This McDonald's is filthy inside.  The woman making the frys was looking at her phone every 30 seconds.  I asked the manager why it was allowed and they said it is because they were slow at that time.  I proceeded to ask why the bathrooms were a nasty disaster with a trash can next to the toilet.  If they have time to look at phone they have time to clean bathroom.
UPDATE  I have gone back to this location on two more occasions and this place is still one of the worst McDonald's around.  The employees are extremely lazy and constantly have their phones out and even set them on the counter where they are working so they can serve food in between playing on the phone.  The entire staff including managers needs to be fired.  The floor is always dirty with trash everywhere and they do not clean the floor because I have seen the same dirty spots for multiple months and they are not stains.  The bathroom was a disaster yet aging and other customers said they do not use the bathroom for that very reason.<//text>

Awefull attitude. The girl at the first window where you pay charged me for someone else's order. Then rolled her eyes at me and put her hands on her hips when I told her that wasn't my order. She had the nerve to tell her manager she confirmed the order before she charged me. She never even looked at me when I pulled up. If she had mumbled something, I had no idea she would've been talking to me. But the eye rolling really got me! I do not pay money at a place to be disrespected, especially when you screwed up!< /Text>

Looks great since the remodel. Higher capacity drive thru and the inside is a little small but new and modern. They have 4 kiosks so that you can order and pay, it helped me to skip the line at the counter. Staff was friendly.<//Review>

< Review>
Me - "You're out of soap in the men's restroom." Them - "Yeah. We don't have any soap." During heavy rain, the homeless populate the dining room.
One year - it took 33 minutes to go through the drive-thru. Which made it convenient for the homeless man who was going door-to-door down the drive-thru line.<//Review>

This McDonalds isn't that great. They remodeled it to have two ordering stations in the drive thru but it just causes the lines to be slower. When I went to 2nd window the employee was really rude and when I told her that I had also ordered a happy meal ( which she hadn't given me) she rolled her eyes at me ( if they teach eye rolling at McDonald's University she must have gotten an A+) I'm a 51 year old lady..i should not be having a young kid rolling her eyes at me when I was being nice to her and just asking for what I had paid for!! I'm not going to this location again.< /text>

<Review>They have a nice little playground for the kids to play and for the most part they keep it clean, but it’s McDonals quality of food is McDonald’s ( chemicals/ flavorless/ you know the rest). Only go there when the kids want McDonalds.< /Review>< pics>

Renovations done at this location were amazing. The place is looking great and the extra order lane in the drive-through is really nice. The location of this McDonalds is far from ideal though and something no amount of reservations can fix. It is crammed into a very busy corner of a shopping center and it can be difficult to get out of the drive-through after receiving your order as you have a stop sign and there's another stop sign for the traffic crossing directly in front of the exit from the drive-through and a that connects to a four way stop. The other thing this location has a problem with is consistency with the staff. I sat at the window while the man working the window laughed and had a conversation with two other female employee's while I waited and waited and WAITED for the single drink I had ordered even with trying to get their attention. Also, if you custom order something, for example with no onions or with extra pickles, chances are you are not going to get it the way you ordered it. So PLEASE be careful if you have food allergies.</Text>

<Text>I ordered breakfast and ate inside the restaurant. The dining room is always clean. I noticed a sign on the wall that read 30 minute time limit no loitering allowed. I noticed the last time I was there that there were transients that were hanging around. I believe this policy change was needed.

First day order was correct but when we add one toy without happy meal and drove to the pick up window we got only meal but no toy. Second day, we were waiting at the pick up #1 take a little longer to get our meal and no ketchup and BBQ sauce. So 3 🌟 for missing items both orders.</Text>

<Text>We were greeted at entry, told to wait, we ordered smoothly after a little confusion on our part-time the cashier was still helpful and patient.
She gave us our change & wished us a good day. Also, when we went back to get ketchup she was still very friendly even though she had a huge line. Thanks!<//Text>< Pictures>

I haven't been to this mcdonalds in 6 months because of a bad experience I had the last time. I returned on October 12 at 11:00pm for an iced coffee and the girl at the drive thru had a bad attitude. She didn't hear my order correctly so I repeated my order, a large hazelnut iced coffee with extra ice. When I got to the window, she gave me an iced coffee that wasn't stirred and didn't have extra ice. I gave it back to her and asked her to stir it. She stirred it and gave it back to me with a bad attitude. I was going to ask for a small cup of ice but I didn't want to tolerate her bad attitude anymore so I drove away. I've been buying iced coffees at different mcdonalds for years and this is the first time I was served one that wasn't stirred. She sure taught me a lesson for trying to be a customer at this mcdonalds again after 6 months.< /text>

<review>So much money wasted on their new drive thru, but their food is still low quality. Ordered 2 sausage mcmuffins, a mcgriddle, and both tasted as if they have been left out a couple hours and warmed up to serve them to us. Better off going to Taco bell or Jack's for their breakfast.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb793d7ca6521:0xd68bc1e4cb3607f8<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They need to keep the bathroom much cleaner.
Otherwise, it's a MacDonald, typically. Nothing to write home about.</review>

I don’t know how this McDonald’s is operating after reading some of the bad reviews.Their customer service is BAD, just the OVERALL experience SUCK. They really need to OVERHAUL their operation there. I for once never ever had a bad experience with McDonald’s until I visited this location. They are absolute the WORST. So if you need to go to McDonald’s I suggest you might try the one off Hidden Valley in Norco.

Anyways I’m posting a review. because I just want to HELP and WARN peopIe from going to this location. Some of the reviews here that just have the star  rating and don’t have any written review should be unacceptable. How can people know what’s GOOD and BAD about a place if people don’t write anything. Anyways I wrote detailing my experience with this McDonald’s on Yelp. So if you use the app read the reviews for McDonald’s on McKinley St.< /Text>

I went through the drive thru to get me and my son a mcrib sandwich.    I ate mine my son put his in the refrigerator to eat tomorrow.  About 2 hours later I felt nauseous but was still functioning.  3 hours later I was vomiting,  diarrhea , chills from 7pm December 3rd to today December 4th 6am and I am still sick. My nausea is not as bad as throughout the night, diarrhea is slowing down cause I have nothing in my stomach.  I still have pain in my stomach.  Just be aware.<//Review>

Since then I've been back many times and my only complaint is that the bathrooms aren't maintained very well.

<Review>Another late-night trip to this McDonalds where I'm stuck in the line and unable to get my food and pay because it's cash only.  Unfortunately there are no signs warning about this issue before being stuck in the line for 30+ minutes??  A simple sign would eliminate the frustration especially since this is an issue at this location that happens often. I hate to leave a bad review because normally I love this McDonald's location but this is a reoccurring problem and somebody should fix it</Review>< pictures>

I completed my order entirely. Then the most mumbled incompetent voice comes over the mic and says,"oh, I don't think I told you but we are only taking cash right now. Is that okay?". Yes, Mr. Lincoln it's  fantastic because paper currency is the only money I know. This McDonalds is amazing and the world is flat..</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Came in at 430 one morning and waited 25 minutes and there was only one car in front of me and all i ordered was a mocha frappe.
Walked in another morning and waited another 20 min for the same thing.

Also tried to order a chicken sandwhicj and was told they dont carry those only chocken nuggets.... so I got frustrated and ordered my mcchicken sandwich by telling the girl to give me a chicken mcnugget sandwhich...<//Review>< Pictures>

Me and my aunt went there a while ago and first of all for the Mcpick 2 meal it said make double or double cheeseburger so I ordered the double cheeseburger and she said the worker  we don't have double cheeseburgers on the menu for the Mcpick 2 so I just ordered the mcdouble only 2 of them... She charged us for 4. And the McDonald's was disgusting soda everywhere wrappers all over the lid  container  Was disgusting you couldn't sit anywhere it was that nasty<//text>

Worst service ever I waited 17 minutes for my order and when I got my order it was wrong I let the manager know and 15 minutes later I still don't have my corrected order I go and I ask for my money back she says here is your Snack Wrap and here is your money back the Snack Wrap is still crispy instead of grilled as I initially ordered< /Review>
