<Review>Lived her over 3 years and love the location, landscape and office team. The office and maintenance team have changed a year or so ago, but overall they really just want to serve the residents. The office is open 7 days a week, pool is now open and the GYM is Amazing! I recommend Cottonwood!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This place used to be a really nice community. But over the years it fell apart. The pond used to be something nice to look at, now its a eye sore. There are tenants that do not respect were they live, and toss trash on the floor and  into the Recyclable bins and not into the Garbage containers and no one seemed to get a handle on this problem. The management needs to really enforce the rules of this property, and not just concentrate on renting these overpriced luxury apartments< /Text>

Jose did a great job!   He was professional (wore a mask, coverings on his feet), completed the work and left it spotless.

On top of this, the office staff are incredible!  Super friendly and helpful for every question or need.  This is a great place to live!<//Review>

Once I received attention from the maintenance staff everything went well.  What bothered me slightly is having to call the office more than once to get the needed attention.  I am not a pushy person but across the board I felt I had to push to communicate how important my issue was in order to see results in a timely manner.  My outlets weren’t working, my oven wasn’t working, my heater wasn’t working and I work from home. Once Jose arrived he worked quickly to troubleshoot the issue.  This took some time as he was telling me that what I perceived to be the issue was not the problem.  This was a little frustrating but he continued working until he was clear on what needed to be fixed.  I really appreciated his effort.  From the time he diagnosed the problem it was only a matter of hours before things were working again.  He fixed everything in his control.  Now I am just waiting for my heater to be fixed and that is dependent upon a 3rd party.</Text>

Also, there’s always plenty of parking. The only negatives would be we had an ant problem which when I called them they were quick to get an exterminator out but it didn’t really resolve the ant issue. Also, the dish washer didn’t wash the dishes very well. Overall I was very sad we had to move but cottonwood is much more expensive than other apartments in the area.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Enjoyed my time here for the most part. I lived alone for a whole year in a one bedroom apartment on the 3rd floor (On the top most floor $1900/m 2019-2020). To be honest it was pretty pricey but the complex itself is pretty nice. You get your own parking space outside and a personal washer and dryer. The noise wasn't too bad but yes, you can hear your neighbors through the walls depending on their noise level. The water and trash bills here is what kinda killed my experience a bit (Around $160 for one person). The staff is really nice. They always helped me whenever I had a problem. From the water heater to wasps appearing in my AC ducts. Overall, I did enjoy my time here but rent in the bay area just sucks in general. Recommend just moving in with multiple people to make rent more affordable together.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I've been living here for 5 years and I cannot even begin to say how much Cotton Wood keeps improving.The ladies in the front office are very friendly. We had a previous manager that was ok but the new manager Nicoya goes above and beyond to meet our needs. Our  time here has been amazing. The new maintenance supervisors Jose is prompt, attentive, friendly, and even follows up with you after a work order to make sure everything is done to your satisfaction. My family and I have never lived in a place where we are so happy and feel so taken care of.
I highly commend Cottonwood apartments because of such quality, wonderful human beings here , it really makes living here a dream. I Highly recommend Cotton Wood.</Text>

Although a seemingly tranquil environment this place does a good job of masking some serious and unhygienic issues.  BAD plumbing, dysfunctional management team, OLD and broken appliances.  So glad I heeded the advice of the tenants on site and did NOT commit to this place based on their feedback and what other honest reviews have said!<//Text>

This review is late. First after reading some of the reviews of others stating not to live here...I would like to say everyone has an opinion. I have lived here over 15 years in two separate units. Cottonwoods Landscape is peaceful and tranquil. We just had a new ownership take over a little over a year ago and new staff. The start seemed a bit bumpy but once the new company settled in this place is amazing and up and running. Nicoya, Makel, Dayna, Will, Kirby and Jose have been not only a joy in assisting me, and my friends but also pleasant at every interaction (I referred Cottonwood many times) They work very hard everyday.
Thank you Cottonwood Team. I will continue to refer others to Cottonwood In Dublin!< /Text>

My sister is an essential worker/nurse and she was subjected to repeatedly unhealthy living conditions including someone else’s bath water ending up in her shower. This management team is completely unprofessional and they simply put bandaids over issues. If you are reading this - avoid this complex and go to one across the street. One where you will be treated with respect and not be repeatedly lied to! This establishment should be ashamed of the apartment complex they run. ***You can see by their response that they take no ownership of the scotch taped housing with poor plumbing they offer. Repeatedly being subjected to broken items, plumbing issues, and a management team that has no idea how to manage a property. Again, avoid this complex at all costs.</Review>< user>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>This place is not like what it used to be a year ago. The ownership & management has changed this year and they seem to care less about their residents now. In the last 6 months alone I have visited their office more times than I did in my previous 2 years of stay here. I hope they can get their act together. They are not even as responsive now if you put in a maintenance request. In the last few months, they have entered our unit a few times but they give only 1 day notice for that. Twice we were out of town for a few days and entered in that time. Obviously we had no prior knowledge or notice since they give 1 day notice only. Both times lights were left turned on. We returned in the middle of the night and were worried if the place was broken into.  There was another incident where our water heater stopped working. There was no hot water and it was so painful to have someone come and fix it. It was out for days. We were given a key to another apartment to use for shower. At first, we got the key which did not work. Luckily for us, Freddy (maintenance staff) was around and we found him to let us in. He was also super nice to put shower curtains in the empty unit when I requested him because all water was spilling out from the tub.

Last time, we had overflow leak in the toilet tank in guest bathroom. We didn't even feel like going to the office to submit the request. The problem would stop if we turn off the inlet valve and turn it back on. When I saw Freddy around, I asked him what might the problem be, just casually - I didn't expect anything from him. The poor guy stopped by late in the evening around 8 pm to check it and fix it. I went to the office next day to put in the maintenance request so at least he gets credit for it. This 4 star is for him and the few good people still around here. Really if these few familiar faces are not around, it would have been more difficult to just finish out our remaining lease period.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1571762288576, 'text': "Nishant, although we appreciate your kind words regarding our hard-working staff members, we are very disappointed to learn that your experience in our community has taken a turn for the worse since new management took over the property.

<text>Definitely going down hill since I moved here 3 years ago. Recently sold and before they did they came into my apartment at least 10 times. Taking pictures of appliances. Seeing if I had older toilets, which I do. (Been promised they were replacing them for over a year & 1/2 now.) Checked water heater. Checked fire alarms. Replaced fire alarms. Installed water sensors behind water heater & washing machine. Checked central air (which works terribly in the master) Changed filters. It goes on and on. And since sold they’ve been in more times checking water heater, checking fire alarms. Power washing balcony without notice of date so I couldn’t remove my items 1st. Painted railings and trim outside without notice. Again having to take my things off the porch. Maintenance doesn’t confirm apts. fix it tickets written up wrong by staff. Rent keeps going up and up. Want to go month to month?! Rent goes up more than $300 and charge a convenience fee of $500 more each month to do so. These apartments are extremely old and no longer “luxury homes” if they ever were.<//text><Name>kathy parker< /Name>< gmap_id>

Cottonwood is probably one of the worst apartments one could rent for the money. The new management is very unresponsive as it took about 3 weeks and 3-4 different office visits to finally get my air conditioning fixed. Have an issue you need resolved? Go ahead and call, only to be sent directly to a voicemail box that clearly no one monitors because you will NEVER get a call back. The apartments are pretty basic for the price and the quality of service you receive. You also have to deal with constant BS complaints from neighbors and constantly hearing dogs barking. This is not a place you want to move. I will be moving as soon as I can.<//text>

<Review>Cottonwood Apartments is a great place to live. It is quiet, very nice and well laid out apt. The leasing office staff extremely helpful, friendly and responsive. The apartment complex is also in a great central location within Dublin, providing quick access to groceries, restaurants, dog park, etc.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Run as fast as you can from this place and all like it…these huge mega-complexes can easily become a nightmare for three main reasons:

1) You get a bad neighbor(s). We have a deranged, drug-addled mountain man and his wife down below (we're in 52G) who have smoked us and another neighbor/their children out of our apartments in the middle of the night because of all the marijuana smoke. The guy has an axe and chops wood, then burns it on his patio and inside his apt. instead of using the electric stove. Sounds "environmentally friendly", eh? Uh, no when we all have wooden decks above the burning fires-and we're in a drought. Also he likes to go outside on his patio NUDE and people, it ain't a pretty sight in the middle of the afternoon. Especially when you're on your stairway and he bends over to moon you…

2) We moved in two years ago and have to rent month-month this summer while looking for a new place (our lease was up in July) Cost: 900.00 more than the 2150 we paid in 2013. How can they do this in Dublin and in Cottonwood Apts? Good question. Howsabout someone has a whole Warehouse full of Lawyers-or something..whenever you ask for an explanation, you are told, "it's the Market". Now ain't that nice?

3) Dublin has a lot of stores-good stores and the best Vets (Parkway Hospital), the best Chiro/masseuse you will ever find in the Bay area- Alexander Chiropractic). That's it. It's congested now and the Projects around here are full of problem 'Childs'. The traffic is a nightmare that will become Elm Street next year because our City Hall salivates over building, building but no traffic/street plans. And the Fire Inspector? He finds no problem with Firebug mountain men who also set off fireworks in front of our vehicles this July 4th-yes the same deranged Nudist in the apt. below. The Inspector 'nicely' told us not to "judge those with a different Lifestyle". Even if their "lifestyle" interferes with their neighbors, animals, the elderly and children's safety?-all helpless beings completely disrespected-here in Cottonwood. Most of them either can't or won't complain. Gee, I wonder why? We did and look what we got-our advice? Run, baby run. and save your $$ for a better rent payment in a better town.</Review>

< review>
This place is awesome and they have really good customer service. I went in there to buy a Mother’s Day Gift and the girls really helped me out. Karina and Danielle are really nice and they knows their products. They helped me save some $$$ by telling me to get the app for rewards. I only come to this store for birthdays and holidays so it helps saving some cash. Also, at the register Sofia was really cool and she gave me candle boxes so that I can wrap them up and make them look nice for the gifts I’m giving away. I really felt welcomed here and I don’t mind spending extra if they really going to help me out since I hardly come into this store. Definetly coming back soon.<//review>

<review>The staff is always happy and ready to help.  I always come here. Been coming here for along time since I used to work In the mall.  Always has great deals and what I need.  The only problem is their lines...  It gets out of hand and people who are up are a little slow but hey nobody is perfect as long as the service is great:)< /review>< response>

<userid>118406297752557564310< /userid><Review>(Translated by Google) Very good products, there is always variety for everyone. It is recommended to wait for the coupons by mail to take advantage of the offers. You can try most of the products there, they have a sink. It is almost always clean and tidy. Good service even when there are many people.

Muy buenos productos, siempre hay variedad para todos. Se recomienda esperar los cupones por correo para aprovechar más las ofertas. Se pueden probar la mayoría de los productos ahí, tienen un lavabo. Casi siempre está limpia y ordenada. Buen servicio hasta cuando hay mucha gente.<//Review></record>

Expensive gas. Go there since I have a card for it when I'm short on cash for cheaper stations.  Want to add that it looks like a complete mini-mart there, with an ad for donuts in the window.  Next time I should go in and check it then add to this review.<//review>

<Text>I've been to Fantastic Sam's my whole life, since I live in Ventura, I come to this location! Glad I do, finally got my nasty quarantine hair cut by Ellie, she was knowledgeable and funny! Every other time I've been it's always been.. Fantastic! Can't beat the price and the work done here< /Text>< pics>

I absolutely love this place and the long term employees that work there.
Only 1 complaint. I’ve lost over heard way too much gossip. One is inclined to believe that do the same when they walk out. Keep the gossip in the back room ladies. You’re better than that. You know who you are- gal with the funny footwear, short and a bit chunky and wearing glasses.<//review>

This is the worst haircut I’ve ever had. I can only rate one hairstylist because I only went there one time recently. I’m sure the stylists are all different. By luck of the draw I got Sabrina.

I went for a color and a cut. The color was fine, although the Aveda Salon down the street charges $6 less and doesn’t leave your forehead stained with color.

The cut was a rush job and it just looks chopped up because it is. No effort was made to cut it correctly or evenly using basic standards any beauty school student could get right. The angles are all wrong and it doesn’t blend. She took thick sections of hair and cut all at once to save time. Anyone who doesn’t take 1/4” sections and go through the hair to cut it evenly is just trying to get you in and out with the least amount of effort for the most amount of money. A haircut will never look good that way.  I will have to wait several months for it to grow out long enough to fix. I’ve never given a bad review for a haircut before. It would just be nice if she had taken some pride in her work and had slowed down a little bit and TRIED to give a nice cut. (Here’s a tip: don’t start by cutting the bangs or front of the hair first. That should be done last, then it won’t come out looking like a 1980’s bi-level.)

It’s a numbers game. Though Sabrina will tell you she’s not the manager, she keeps the store phone next to her so she can get every call and answers in the middle of your service.

I will say I went there years ago and had a positive experience. Don’t go to this place unless you know who you are getting.  I’m sorry to say I won’t be back.< /text>

<review>I called at 2:38 pm, knowing they closed at 3., asking if they could give me a cut.  The lady who answered said, "if you get here right now".  I said, "I'll be right there.  I'm five minutes away".   I walk in, expecting to prepay and tip cash, so they can close their register and go about their closing process.
The lady who received me, (presumably the same who answered the phone), was like, "oh, you pay afterwards sweety".
And said, "Evelyn, cut".

Evelyn calls me over a minute later, and shampoos, conditions, and treats my hair, telling me about the product and the current condition of my hair (terrible).
When she finished, it felt like silk, like butter, like satin sheets,...  whatever is extremely soft and smooth and pleasing to touch.  That's what it felt like!

We talked while she cut.  She answered all my questions and gave me information on where to get the best hair to make custom extensions.  [  ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL HAIR IN OXNARD - SPEAK TO MARIA ].   [  Apparently Maria can match your extensions to your hair type - which is important for quality extensions, that are lightweight, and long lasting, that blend perfectly.  ]
Evelyn will sew them together, then style, trim, and layer them accordingly so they fit and look natural.  It's $100 per weft.   (you would typically need about 3-4 wefts.)

It was only $18 for the cut!!!?!?   I tipped her another $18 for being awesome!  The entire visit, - from when I walked in - to now, sitting in my car typing up this review, was literally only 20 minutes!  Amazing!

See Evelyn.

Also, the fact that I came in just minutes before they close, everyone was very gracious and professional.   Noone seemed rushed, or irritated or like they couldn't be bothered by my inconsiderate, last minute arrival.  I was pleasantly surprised and very grateful.  Thank you Evelyn and the rest of the staff for accommodating me and my rudeness with out even batting an eye.

Highly recommend this business .  Pleasantly surprised.  I will be back</review>< pics>

<review>When I went in, a lady stopped the haircut she was doing to make a spot on the line for me, and I only had to wait about 10 minutes. The lady who cut my hair was very friendly and communicative,  and even though I couldn't be too specific about my instructions, gave me a 95% approximation to what I'd wanted. Only reason I'm giving them a 4 and not a 5 is that $17 a haircut is kind of steep, but their service and people are so good that I'd definitely go again!<//review><date>1482277563395</date><Rate>4< /Rate><user_id>102364144241993317861< /user_id><name>Alan Baer</name><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

The lady who cut my hair was being very sarcastic during my haircut. She was also being very aggressive with my hair. She would pull my hair and it was very uncomfortable. It was not a very pleasant experience.</Text>

My daughter had her hair colored wanted sandy blond got dark green! The hairdresser said it was because her hair was damaged, she shouldn't have done anything the $77.00 was more important. We complained the hairdresser in the beginning she said said, "it will wash out." It never did. I contacted their manager and owner no help! Am reporting them to the BBB now.< /Text>

Pros:
- good selection of sushi
- food is as fresh as can be
- they have uni as well as oysters
- friendly service

Cons:
- sometimes slow service
- little annoyances, e.g. some dishes like soups are not being delivered with the needed soup bowls so you have to flag down your server again to bring you bowls<//text>

Called 2 days ahead of time because the website asked for 1 day ahead for sushi platters.  Showed up and not only wasn't it ready but they forgot. The order was on their wall so it definitely should've been noticed.  The only explanation given to me was that it was new girl that took order and that it takes couple hours to make the platters.  What does that do for me now when I'm missing 70 pieces of sushi for a family gathering.< /review>

Spicy, very spicy.  Some different rolls, but a little to soggy for my taste.  Service was great!< /text>

<time>1617416734325< /time><Rate>3<//Rate><review>I would have given a 5 star because their quality of food is top notch and their service is outstanding. But their amount of food versus dollar amount is a losing battle, I spent over $60 and I am just barely full and this is for only me, one person. Their sushi rolls are really small not your normal size that is ordered any where else, ordered a carpaccio dish for $11.50 and I got 5 peices of fish covered in fried arugula so you couldn't see what you were getting. Going to look for another place for sushi.< /review>< pics>

I will be updating a more detailed review later in for now I can say the place is nice inside and well organized, food was fresh but a little pricey for the size portions we got were kind of too small.</Text>

I visit this spot a lot since I work close by. I got to say the customer service is always great and they keep the place neat at all times. Pricing is fair and they serve generous portions.<//text>

<review>Happy hours are all day Monday and Tuesdays. Best days to come. They’re sushi is really good here. They carry uni which is a plus and usually indicates a good sushi bar. Limited items on happy hour with a special happy hour menu. Not all items are half price.

Overall, very good. Everything is fresh. The Ikura and albacore handroll were way to salty, but those were the only issues. First time there, so not sure if that was normal or a one off. Will be going back for sure.<//Text>

The fish in all of our orders was very fresh. Sushi World sends out coupons regularly; combined with their great happy hour menu, they offer quality sushi for a very reasonable price. If anything, our orders took a bit long to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait.<//text>

This place is seriously good. So good I almost don't want to write a review because I'm afraid it will help if become crazy popular. 1st off they have Orion beer on draft. Their sushi tastes super fresh you barely need soy sauce. The staff is super friendly and we typically get sat right away. If you don't like this place then good! More for me.</text>

The service is very friendly and fast. Everyone is wearing masks. You can choose to eat inside,outside or take your food to go.
It is expensive though.
$7 for 6 pcs of tuna roll!<//review>

<Time>1583615257860< /Time><Rate>3< /Rate><review>This is a small place in a strip mall. The people working are very friendly and accommodating. I went as one of a group of 8 people. The sushi was okay but not impressive. I also had the fried calamari which was pretty good and a salad with the seared tuna. The dressing on the salad was extremely spicy which was not mentioned on the menu. I think the menu said it has a garlic ponzu dressing. I was expecting more of a citrus and soy sauce flavor. I managed to scrape enough of the dressing off the tuna and salad to be able to eat it.< /review>< pictures>

Even going only a few times a year, they remember me and welcome me “home”. It’s hard to find that anywhere, these days. Their menu is amazing, the sushi is fresh, and they have a fun happy hour!< /review>< Pics>

It's a very relaxed and calming vibe. Sort of hidden in a sense. I loved every bit of it! The customer service was fantastic and the prices are reasonable.<//review>< user>

<response>None<//response><review>My girlfriend and I are visiting from Tokyo and I thought I’d take her to some decent sushi around here. We went to the closest place from our hotel which happened to be this.

Upon arrival at dinner time there were no customers there. Red flag as it was we thought we’d try since we were ravenous.

We sat down and put in our drink order upon which we we’re ID’d. Turned down my girlfriend’s REAL ID from Japan after the server checked with his sushi chef because the server couldn’t read Japanese.

Well, turns out neither could the sushi chef (all 3), who claimed her ID looked “Chinese”. But clearly on the back of the card is our Japanese address and simple words in Hiragana such as まで to indicate the date of expiry.

This place is a total joke and a waste of an establishment. Don’t give Japanese people a bad impression on the approach to Japanese dining in LA.< /review><GmapID>0x80dd292c4ae5d14b:0x3b81cb81b8f496e9<//GmapID><Rate>1</Rate>< user_name>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Good eats. Rather a bit pricy. Need to tell chef to ease up on the mayo on the CA/Baked Scallop rolls though. I've had better edamame. You actually can go wrong with edamame - overcooked, undercooked, dried out. On my second visit, edamame was dried out and cold. Food was good.< /Review>< pics>

There a lot of sushi places around this area but this one really sticks out!!! The seafood & fish are super fresh and the prices are unbeatable! It’s small inside with not a lot of seating but it’s perfect for take-out! They make the orders super quickly!</text>

Extremely creative chefs, constantly experimenting with new dishes. Super fresh fish (of course) friendly staff. Try the three amigos, or let the sushi chefs make a selection for you! We've never been disappointed<//Review>

The three sushi chefs make any time I am there so pleasant.  They are super accommodating and each with their own special personality.  The wait staff is awesome too and now that I am a regular, they anticipate my order and put special touches on it.  My hands down favorite is Jalapeno Yellowtail, but I love the roll with fried arugula too.  Everything is great here.  Only downside is parking can be troublesome.  Owner, staff, food...2 enthusiastic thumbs up!!!!!!!< /text>

I got the 13 piece sushi combo. A lot of the fish was dry and just kind of bland. Tuna roll is nothing out of the ordinary. This place is probably better for their creative rolls. If you just want traditional sushi try somewhere else.<//review>

Gyoza were just ok, not great but still good.  Had the Combo B sushi which was very good, but a bit too much for one person.  No problem; doggy bagged it back to the hotel and will enjoy a second dinner later this evening.  Recommended; I would return here.<//text>

They didn't have much of a selection like most sushi places do & the happy hour is very limited.  Also no deep fried rolls. The service was fast & staff was very friendly but food selection is just ok. For the price you pay too you can get more food at many other sushi spots.< /Text>

Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant to go to.  The staff are the best. Always welcoming with smiles and attentiveness.   The chefs are awesome.  They prepare, in my opinion, the freshest and tastiest nigiri I have every eaten.  I'm not talking the sushi with crab in it but the sushi with a fish topping on rice.  The happy hour is the best way to go to get your nigiri fix on without paying a whole lot.  I highly recommend this place to everyone!<//Review>

<Text>Sashimi was reasonably priced and larger portions than I had expected. Wait staff was patient and didn't overwhelm me with niceties which made my late lunch very pleasant.< /Text>< gmap_id>

The Sapporo draft was great. Also ordered the squid karaage to go with it, paired together nicely. We ordered a blue crab roll, lots of crab but its missing that umami flavor you usually get at other places like sugar fish, sushi stop, etc. I don't recommend getting the avocado rolls , small portions and it was ok. Im glad the service was fast and friendly.<//text>

Awful experience. Waited an hour for rolls while our son's chicken teriyaki plate arrived AND he finished still no rolls. Staff standing around talking we ask about our order still no food 48 minutes later 2 of 3 rolls appear...58 minutes later no 3rd roll so ask for the co and only then get an apology for the wait.
Staff chuckling as we walk out smiling saying sorry.
I guess we weren't wanted</review>

{'time': 1502141291327, 'text': "Hi Melissa. We are extremely sorry to hear about your poor experience with us this past Saturday. We were very busy that day but it's no excuse for taking so long getting you your food. It is definitely not a normal thing for us and we hope we can make it up to you in the future. Our staff were definitely not chuckling at you.  You are most definitely wanted and deserve to be treated properly.  Again, we truly apologize."}</resp>

If you are looking for a tire shop that will provide service after your purchase this is definitely not the shop for you. I purchased a set of 4 top of the line Michelin tires from them. When I came in for a nail in my tire it was clear they did not want to patch it. The employee at the counter told me I would need to leave the car for 6 hours for them to fix it. I have bought tires before and the shops I have gone to in the past have provided air checks, rotations and patches for tires purchased through their business. Rossi Bros. Tire and Auto Service will never get any business from me again.<//Review>

I've been coming to this shop for many years now for tire service on my two vehicles and have found the service to be second to none. I've found Mike Rossi and Carlos to be very knowledgeable and honest in dealing with customers. They are very good about selling you the right tire for the car you have and the type of driving you do. I highly recommend this shop and I think you will be very pleased and comfortable dealing with them.</review>

Great service. Greeting with a genuine smile.  Let me know before repairing or replacing anything; I was asked first!  Clean waiting room with free coffee.  Best of all... Clean bathrooms!!!!  Great place for car servicing!  I'm recommending them to everyone!!!!  Definitely 5 star service!!!!< /Text>

Very friendly and helpful. We live in Salinas, have bought new tires here, and had them put on 2 of our cars. Great service, no problems. On our 3rd vehicle, we had a blowout down in King City one night over Christmas holidays, and they loaned us a tire to get back to Salinas, and then we purchased 2 tires as replacements. Thank you Rossi Bros.!<//Text>

<review>I have done business with Rossi's for years and each time I am more impressed by their quality of work and wonderful customer's sartisfaction concern.

Sssssssslow................. and they did not remorely fix the problem, yet still charged me big bucks. It's like the mechanic was just guessing. When I complained, the mngr/owner? blew me off like it was my fault. I'm sure for tires and alignment they are ok....just don't trust their diagnostic skills. TAKE YOUR CAR TO THE EXPERTS AT THE DEALERSHIP!!!<//Review>

I will not be going back to this place. I almost felt as if they tried to deny me service. I walked in and asked for a quote to get a drive-train part replaced on my car and the guy working the counter said I had to make an appointment just so that someone inspects my car before they quote me. Very unprofessional they didn’t even bother asking what was the make and model of my vehicle.< /Text>

<text>So you think you can't dance?  Yes you can.  This studio is amazing for those who don't want a boring workout and who want to have fun and maybe even learn something.  I can certainly see how experienced dancers critique this place, but if you want a place where you will be welcome even without experience, this is it.< /text>< Rate>

I've been coming to this place for years (inconsistently) when I'm in the area. I can always count on good quality fish. Servers are friendly and native Japanese speaking. Had the aji (spanish makerel) and it was very fresh and tasty. Hamachi (yellowtail) was good and that is my marker of quality sushi. Halibut special was tasty. Nice sauce. We also had the shrimp tempura udon. Noodles are great consistency and broth was very tasy. Tempura was done well.<//review>

Of all the accomplishments in my life, I am most proud of the fact that I am now 7 months sober. I've gotten good grades, received a college education, got different awards and metals but nothing beats this feeling of being clean. I really wouldn't have been able to reach this level of sobriety if it weren't for this staff and their addiction recovery program.</review>

<Review>This plaza offers a different variety of restaraunts, offices, a movie theatre, and other assorted businesses just like the Oceanview plaza across the street. The Parking lot does not suffer from the same problems as OVP, but there are definitely far less places to park, but the design makes better sense.

UPDATE: Movie has closed, but more restaraunts of great value have since moved in to add to the variety there.</Review><name>Raiown</name><user_id>113057734080508537841< /user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

Nobody supported me to get better when I was addicted to codeine, vallium and vicodin. I checked myself into this San Clemente drug rehab center and all that changed. Everyone here fully supported me and pushed me to get clean.< /review>

A nice place to visit. The story of how it got to this location is fascinating. Of course it started here in the 1850's.

About a hundred years later a man in the Valley, not far from here was creating a western theme park and wanted to have a historic jail. He had it taken apart brick by brick and moved to his new park.

After he died his heirs wanted to sell the property. The new buyer wanted to use it for something else. He notified the county that if we wanted it back we had to get it quickly or it would be bulldozed.

That isn't something that can be done quickly. They put the word out and put a committee together that began raising the money and talent needed.

The county donated the land. A group of people went, took it apart brick by brick and rebuilt it where it is now. Not very far from where it was 150 years earlier.

I know that I made it sound easy. It wasn't. There were many fundraising problems, several times it seemed like it wouldn't happen. Then the brain power and labor that understood and was willing to defer to the architect and historians. Maybe you're beginning to understand that there are many people to thank for it being here.</review>

Very rarely open. When it is not worth the hype. Don't waste your precious time. Go to Columbia instead.</Review>

Came here to find out my Baby’s gender at 13 weeks. The Technician was very friendly, experience was very nice. Only down side was the technician accidentally hinted the sex of the baby when I did not want to know. I also explained to her that I did not want to know and if she can just type it on the photo. Of course it must have slipped out. But still, it was very upsetting, I wanted to find out with my whole family, and I didn’t get to experience that.< /Text>

This place was awesome!! So relaxing and they really take their time with you! My baby wouldn’t uncross it’s legs for the first ultrasound and they booked me for another gender scan at no cost! I love the photos I received as well. Really great place!!!</review>

Baby's first photos has been a huge part of my first pregnancy and now my second. I have not a single bad thing to say about them. The pictures and images we got of our daughters are absolutely amazing. They made me feel so comfortable. I was able to bond with my girls before I could hold them. Not to mention, the early gender scans, are our favorite part following the amazing 4D. I would be lost without baby's first photos ❤️I highly recommend to any expecting mommy!< /Review>

<review>Did the gender reveal ultrasound a couple weeks ago and had an amazing experience. Found out I'm having a little boy. The office was very clean and the stuff was super friendly. The room had dim lighting and relaxing music playing. Very comfortable couch for my family to sit and watch on the big screen. Definitely recommend to all my pregnant friends. Thank you!</review>< Pics>

This service is a gender reveal through blood. I won the free gender reveal and was so excited to go in and check it out. They do this as early as 9 weeks!!!! I was shocked at how fast the results came in too. 24 hours!!!!! when I went into their business, the tech took me into their office and drew my blood(I am a tough draw for most phlebotomists!) that was her first question. She did a double tourniquet and drew on the first poke! I was amazed most of the time it takes a couple pokes and frustration. This tech was awesome, she took her time and was so gentle. I was extremely impressed. The staff was super friendly and nice. I loved this experience, and thank you Baby’s First Photos for allowing me to try this for free!!!! We are so thankful for this gift and are very impressed with your staff!
Forever grateful.< /review>< Name>

I am extremely disappointed, my sister has tried to get the teddy bear with the baby’s heartbeat & since the beginning they stated that they had the teddy bears. We waited 2 months. They continue to lie that they will received  the teddy the previous week but never came in. There was times when we would come to our appointment and it would be closed. Didn’t receive a message or phone call that it would be closed. Overall this was a very stressful experience. I honestly don’t recommend to go here. It is a waste of money. 100% sure you can find a cheaper option.</Review>

When I was pregnant with my twins I came here for a couple of ultrasounds. I love that she was very knowledgable and showed and explained everything in our ultrasound. My older girls loved the big screen of being able to see their siblings and my husband enjoyed all of us being there together to share the memories. The office was very clean and big enough to have all my family there to enjoy our babies. Thank you for an awesome experience!<//Review>

However with this pregnancy I tried to use a Groupon, and they treated me like crap, like if I was getting it for free. NEVER COMING BACK, AND FOR SURE NEVER RECOMMENDING THEIR HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//Text>< Pictures>

Baby's first photos offered our family a warm and welcome place to see photos of my baby niece.  Their care and service were top notch.  Truly a wonderful place to share these special moments with your family.<//Review>

< Review>
I understand food is decent, but customer service was very poor last night. Walked in and asked if by chance they could seat four. Hostess said yes, at 7:45 (about an hour later) and noted my name and number. I called my friends, who head to the Barlow, and I hung out. We return at 7:45 to be told no table is available (turn over not as quick as they expected) and that we couldn’t wait for a table since they stop seating at 8:00. Only option was an outside table and it was chilly. I noted that they really need to get their act together and that we waited over an hour. Hostess then explained that if we really wanted a table, we should have made reservation online. It would have been nice if she shared that initially vs. setting up 7:45 seating for us. Management came out and was absolutely useless - not even an apology. Suggest we locals think twice before supporting this place and their bad attitude.</Review>

My review is based strictly on the Korean Poke bowl as that is all I had. This item should not be called a poke bowl. Call it cubed tuna on rice with some kimchi. A poke bowl insinuates a nicely marinated fish, likely with various additions to the bowl. I know that poke bowls are popular but if you are going to try to capitalize on the trend then do it right. The fish was bland and not very good.<//Text>

Sushi SoSo, you get one 1st impression and this was a fail. Simply unsanitary, I was really disappointed to have a random thick black hair throughout the citrus salmon roll. I ordered the red dragon and the #7 as well, but didn't feel like picking through them to find other healthcode violations. Cleanliness is never a choice--especially during covid-19, where people's lives are at risk. Restaurant competition is at an all time high, step your game up. The owner Jake did apologize and gave me a refund but didn't offer to remake the food? Jake also gave me a gift card for an unknown amount, but it was after his nonchalant response and ordered food elsewhere.< /text>

<Text>What a sad looking and tasting pork belly and kimchi bowl.  Shame on you for selling this to your customers, and selling this at $16.

Vehemently discouraging all readers to turn away from this place.

Shameful.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8VRrB6RDhND7OO8rYLJd_xeV3VuY2MDbw80ro=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record>

<Review>This is some of the best sushi we have had in Northern California. It was very surprising because we did not expect such good sushi to be here in Sevastopol. The location of the restaurant is a little small so we had a little wait but it’s in an awesome outdoor mixed market and shopping area called the Barlow and we easily killed some time walking and sitting by the park next door. Two or three fun looking bars in the vicinity.

The food was excellently prepared with high quality ingredients. This is not a $150 omakase type of experience, but for its class of family style accessible Japanese places, the food is more than solid, it’s exquisite and at a reasonable price compared to similar places all throughout the Bay Area.

The standout was the 15 spices ribs appetizer. Perfectly prepared, seared outside and tender outside, impressed our international table. The sushi is also made with great fish. This time I didn’t try any special toro but the quality of the fish makes me think there is a secretly overtalented chef in the back taking it one step at a time to deliver what’s needed for a family commumity. This is awesome and not a crazy price at about $40 per person including tip and tax for five people for a fantastic dinner.

Easy parking here lots of free parking at the Barlow. Try to make a reservation ahead of time if you can!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvHAQdCeTNkB8RL0eCm5FGFOCRkQj1qdxkPqSr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNF3SViFgu_YgycAf2c3Q_cJuy52epk-BwxdxlQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1X9txD9UNLh_moMGk16TFuvKeUtH6f1TZmR9d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMor2hSBdtwjucN47U3eOszqD0xIOjWQ_bSGEVe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWmVNTfYm0DwEPCsQNPIWYCA0GqILwV0M3FPe6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObYeYbagRVkjLtTP8vpVcgEN8C_G4cn0PULGPJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMznK0x0H_eHUL6ix59jXYAVntMmGZrRKxUzAjk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3Itpn1QHKlD1HBrfIdKrYnVzYKl46sKXbW9Eu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Reservations for 3 turned to 5 with plenty of space and no complaints. Service was on point and attentive. Menu was full of intetestings options for any fussy diner...yet not overwhelming. I like to see that because it allows for the kitchen to focus on quality in preparations. Food didn't disappoint...best to order things al a cart so you can have lots of choices. Nicely plated and we 'll seasoned dishes. Just right for a date or casual diner. Cozy fire ring just out side and great location in the Barlow makes you want to linger.

Only down sides...space is cavernous and a bit cold...bring layers. Bet it's great in the summer.< /review>

I have been to many sushi restaurants with a variety of experiences from great to absolutely poor. This establishments quality of food was mediocre at best with the portions being poor. Most of these things I can get past, but the one thing I absolutely can't condone is the owners complete disrespect for his employee. I was talking to our server about the small portions and the owner came up to our table, grabbed her by the arm and pulled her out of the way so he could get in my face about my complaint. There is a way to handle this situation, but that is definitely not acceptable<//text>

Citrus roll (salmon, crab, slice of lime) + miso.  Impressed by quality (freshness) and innovative ingredients.   Pretty nice space too.  Surprised it wasn't busier</text>

<review>Probably the best sushi option in West County. I love that they had okonomiyaki, although it was kind of their take on okonomiyaki, instead of a being a big hardy grilled dish it was a smaller portioned and fried version (delicious nonetheless).</review>< Pics>

<Review>We recently returned to Kosho.  We went there about a month after they opened and enjoyed it.  But on this visit we love it.  The sushi is good, the starters are fantastic.  Certainly the best seafood salad we've had in the U.S. and rivals anything we've had in Japan. The service was great.< /Review>< pictures>

Fun sushi - yes, delicious and fun.  I snuck in here on a weeknight because hubby was gone, and what a fun place.  The chef, who I hear is from everywhere great, knocks out innovative sushi, and those bacon wrapped mochi balls are really tasty.  I only had the red dragon roll with that really tasty onion sauce, and some wagyu (A5 - how do they get this??),  I wish I was hungrier or with more people.  The chef is very entertaining.  Honestly, such high quality - this place is amazing.  Loved every bite.</text>

Food was OK.  Nothing real standout about the experience.  An order of Edamame and one roll with a Root Beer was $35.  The Root Beer was the best part of the meal.</Review>

6:45PM - request table for two, she told me 15 minute wait time.

7:15PM - check in with the hostess, told me she had to clear off a table for us.

7:45PM - check in with the hostess, told me she had to clear off a table and I could wait up front for that.

8:00PM - watch two people sit down at the bar who had just walked in.

8:15PM - arrived at Sushi Hana instead and was immediately seated

Really? After an hour and fifteen minutes of waiting, you aren't even going to offer me seating at the bar or anything?<//review></record></dataset><record>

Good sushi. Interesting dishes, not just sushi. Is a little on the expensive side for what was served. I got the miso soup, which was nice but not worth $6, and the beef dumpling appetizer and tuna tataki roll, both of which were quite good.<//Review>

After visiting Japan my love of high-quality sushi intensified - I was thrilled to discover Sushi Kosho, the best sushi in Sonoma County.  The quality of the fish is excellent, the rice spot-on, and the presentation beautiful (although I usually get nigiri so quality is far more important to me than presentation).  In addition to the sushi the non-raw items I tried were incredible - the flavors complemented each other perfectly - so this is a great place to come even if someone in your party isn’t into sushi, there are a lot of options to chose from and every single one that my group tried was loved from the first bite.  The seaweed salad was incredible and had the largest variety of seaweed that I’ve seen in an American restaurant.<//Text>

$6 for a small cup of miso soup? It wasn't even that delicious! I had a chicken sesame rice bowl, which was fine, if very breaded/fried. The sushi my friend ate looked nice ($6 for beautifully crafted salmon skin roll... so why is miso soup the same price???). Service at lunch was adequate; friendly but not intrusive. I don't mind paying for a meal, but I'll definitely not go back to this particular spot.</text>

Unbelievable! Fresh , each piece was perfect texture. We tried the truffle yellowtail sashimi, expensive but worth all 4 bites of pure perfection.
We also got the sushi sashimi combination, plenty of food and reasonable.  Handrolls loaded.  There was some delay, but service was attentive and apologetic.  Best sushi I've had this side of the Pacific!< /text>

<Review>Best foot long chili cheese dog you'll get anywhere. Classic kind of place. Had fry's, shrimp, Burgers and fish from here . Chili cheese dog is the number 1. Burger is good but is a compressed Pattie and that's the only reason they don't get 5 stars.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Not good food paid 7.07 for fish and chip and got 2 pieces of fried fish that was over friend and looked like a piece of steak fry. Onion rings were over fried and did not tast good, had to go over arsenals Mexican food and order more food, the Nachos were excellent. Not go to chuck wagon thought that all the people out meant good food bit Not this case.<//Text>

Daughter went to pick it up. Chili dog and chili burger. Dog was good too many onion chunks. Burger  was disgusting. Smashed flat and not cooked. Not worth the visit<//Text>

A local favorite.  The chili boats, deluxe burritos and chili dogs are all family favorites. But mine will always be Clark burgers, no onions or pickles with crinkle cut fries and a Dr. Pepper.  🤤< /text>

There ok i guess I sure miss the previous owners chili... their chili looks just like the previous owners but it doesn't  taste as good.  Not sure why I'm sure they bought the recipe along with the business. I just don't go that much anymore because of that reason.  Staff is not that friendly seems as though there to busy to show a little kindness towards the customers.  They still get allot of customers so people still like the chili they make now and like i said it's not bad it's just not as good as the previous owners.<//text>

Oh my it was pure joy in my mouth!  I ordered the Chuckburger with jalapenos, onion's the works!  I needed a fork to get all the extra goodies from my burger wrap.
Next trip, chili dog with the works.< /review>

I haven't been to Chuck Wagon in a long time. Used to love it in my youth. The people there are very nice. However, to my disappointment, they don't serve their chili by the brick anymore, just cups. We ordered hamburgers, a chilidog, fries. The usual kind of stuff. I don't know if I got bigger or the food shrank, but the hamburgers seem small. A double burger with everything has pickles and lettuce and the patties and bun are the same size as Mcdonald's hamburgers.  That's why I'd don't go to McDonald's!! I'd like to see them step up their food.</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><review>Excellent Local American Dining at it's best. Friendly, welcoming family atmosphere. Outdoor eating available. There sodas seem better than anywhere else. The chili is deliciously famous. Inexpensive. Popular place in town. No indoor seating but it goes with the experience.< /review>< pics>

Every year my family makes the trek from SoCal to vacation in Shaver Lake and every year I pass by the Chuck Wagon in Sager California wondering what magic resides in this walk-up food shack with the proclamation...Home of the "Chili Dog". This year my wife helped me with this bucket-list item by agreeing to stop at Chuck Wagon for lunch before heading into the Sierras. Was it a good "Chili Dog" you ask? Oh Yes, a very good chili dog...I would highly recommend it if you like Chili Dogs. But, if you do not like chili dogs this will not convert you.  The Chili Cheese Fries are also great, they put lettuce on top...I think that is the Chuck Wagon version of a salad. The star of the show is probably the Frito Pie my wife ordered. What is a Frito Pie you ask?...One small bag of Frito corn chips sliced open sideways, and then add chili, cheese, onions, and lettuce...served with a spork. Delicious!

I love that this place has existed for all these years and just keeps on going. It was obvious that it is popular with locals, not many tourists stopping in. Would I go back? You bet! That being said I don't think it will become a yearly tradition as my wife and daughter were not as thrilled with the Chuck Wagon as myself. But this place put a huge smile on my face and I will surely be back their again some day.<//Text>

The food was amazing but we ordered a chili dog and it came in a paper bag? It was really messy and soggy and seeped through the bag. The cashier could of been a little more friendly too.< /review>

<date>1553818084301</date><rating>5<//rating><Text>The Chuck Wagon is a Sanger, CA institution.  As a long, long, long time Sanger resident I may be biased, but I do love this place.  If you have never been there before, it may seem intimidating but the staff is willing to answer questions.  The "Clark Burger" (no affiliation) is your standard double cheeseburger.  The chili is a meat (no beans) chili.  If you like good, greasy chili, then you will like this.  Much better (IMHO) than Tommy's in Southern California.  I know from which I speak on that point, as I went to school in SoCal and spent many a late night at Tommy's.

Fries are crinkle cut and always done to perfection.   I recommend using them to scoop up any chili that has fallen off of or out of your chili dog or Chili Clark.

Best bets? Most anything with chili on it - chili dog, chili cheese fries, chili Clark.  Note that chili cheese fries come with lettuce and onions on them.  I order without those items, but it is a matter of personal preference.

I will forever (or until such time as they get a new shake machine) miss having a chocolate milkshake with my chili dog.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

The chiliedog was not that good. I thought it would be better. But for a nice long footlong hot dog it's alright. Bit pricey.</Review>

Their ordering windows need a bit more organization so that you know who's ordering and who's picking up. Maybe use one for orders and one for pick up so that grumpy customers don't think you're crowding the line. Yes that happened lol, and we even asked if they were in line.

Sometimes I feel that the chili is too hot, as in temperature, and have to let it cool down a few minutes before I could eat to not burn myself. Very few times the chips had gotten soggy by the time I tried to eat it. I don't really mind because I keep returning for Frito pies. For the most part the service is pretty quick and usually friendly.< /Review><gmapID>0x8094f90050be4dcb:0x8a52470b825bc0f3<//gmapID>< rate>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Customers are nicer then employees. Charged me 32 dollars and was only supposed to be charged 18 wow nearly double the cost.  I aked why one order of chili fries were 3 something and three other one wad 14 something. Aslo charged me double cheese 4 times. When i asked the owner about pricing, the employee that over charged me lied and said i ordered 4 chili fries and three extra cheese on all. And the owner believed her not me.  Then i didn't hear them call our number,  waited till they finished with a costumer to see if they called our number. Owner ignored us looked past us and asked to help the next in line, the people behind us said she as Kim ed you guys a question maybe help her. It's sad when business act this way... horrible experience for the first time and for over seasoned chili with a slice of cheese melted on top not shredded and way too many onions.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Gmap_id>0x8094f90050be4dcb:0x8a52470b825bc0f3<//Gmap_id><Text>Best chili cheese fries, hands down! You just walk up, place your order, wait to be called, get your food, and either walk around back to the picnic tables, or get to where you're gonna be real quick, so you can enjoy some awesomely bomb chili. My favorite item is the chili cheese dog. It's a foot long dog, covered in their chili & cheese. I get it with onions, but whatever. Lol Anyway, they have a cool menu, oh and delicious shakes as well! I HighLee recommend this local staple.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Great Chile (NO Beans) I really hate it when people call Chile Beans, Chile. All of their food is good. Try the onion rings and the rest of their fried foods, good stuff. They also have great ice for their soda.< /review>

<rating>4</rating><text>Was driving through Sanger hungry, saw this little place with locals lined up ordering, so I figured there had to be a reason.  Stopped, ordered a burger and drink, got it pretty quickly and was decent.  Definitely not world class food, but it did hit the spot and I'm sure I'll stop by again should I be in the area.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
It's a good place to get chili. I usually get the big cup of chili. Go home and make chili dogs n frito boats(frito pie) Either way it's an easy place to find and cheap. Menu is a lot smaller and they added some items. All In all I love it. I drive from fresno there.<//Review>

<text>I've been living in Sanger for 20 Years and I must say this place is definitely a staple for this city. Throughout the years, prices have always remained constantly low. Now add the combination of Cheese and chili and you've got yourself a tasty and cost efficient meal.

If you're new to the place, great starter items are the Chili Cheese Fries and Chili Cheese dog.<//text>< Pics>

Anybody who goes to Sanger, you have to stop by Chuck Wagon! Home to the "Chili Dog". You won't regret it they are really good! And the Clark Burger too...Go check them out and buy a t-shirt and tell your friends and family....< /text>

The food was great but the customer service was not all that with the PREGNANT girl , no smile very blunt to answer my questions I was timid to ask her for any food suggestions!  This was my first time here and I guess my last ! She need to go on  maternity leave !< /review>

The Chilie never disappoints.  I normally get the Clark Special with the Chilie fries. No matter what you get you'll love it. They'll even sell a frozen block of Chilie to warm up I. The crock pot at home. And it come out just as amazing. Either way it's a win for my family. Love this place.<//text>

Dirty little secret in Sanger. That kind of food that leaves your feeling greasy, dirty, and very very satisfied. Pure American gluttony.<//Review>

For the last 15 years I have been doing the extreme junk food binge here. If I am going to eat this kind of food, which is quite unhealthy; I'd rather take on the calorie debt here with this menu of comfort food delights. Quality and taste have varied only slightly since I first started going to Chuck Wagon.</Text>

<Text>All I can say is for me I'm happy and sad eating here. My father would.bring me and my sister here when we were kids. And when we had our kids we would eat.here as a family . Toward my dads last days he was able to eat hos footlong chili cheese  dog with everything on it. He has been gone for 4 years now. An ed we make it a point  to eat here at least once a month. So I do get sad when I eat here because  all the great moments we had.  Thank you chuck wagon keep up the great food.  The Alvarez family<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Normally I get exactly what I asked for but not this evening. I still love the food but I want what I want, when I take the time to drive 30 miles for it. So it may take me a while to make the trip again.<//review>

Honestly, the best chilli ever. I have never had any better. I would gladly go back here as often as possible once I get a car. If you haven't been here yet, go as soon as possible. You will NOT be disappointed.< /Review>

I really liked the burger despite it being drowned in a bath of chilli, but once I got past it, I could swallow it. wasn't a big fan of the fries either, they seemed stale and again, drowned in a bath of chilli<//review>

< review>
Its OK. Everyone from Sanger always swears by it "the best place ever!!!!" My wife and her family are from Sanger and love love LOVE it. But I bust everyone's bubble...I work at a supermarket...and one day at work I was stocking an aisle. And I saw these people near the chili beans. And I overheard "now let's get the stuff for chuck wagon..." And I saw the lady and man grab every can of Hormel chili (no beans) off the shelf...and I was thinking..."I knew it!" Everyone loves the chili...but its straight up can chili...maybe they add an ingredient or 2 but it's just can chili...so there. Hope I didn't crush all of your dreams...< /review>

<review>I got a Clark burger plain (just meat and cheese on a bun), wife got a chilli cheese dog with onions, and we split chilli cheese fries without onions. The chilli is sauce and ground beef without beans. The fries are the crinkle cut type.
I thought the chilli has a light taste reminiscent of the taco meat that you get from Taco Bell but the wife disagreed.
Overall the taste of the food isn't going to explode in your mouth. It's plain. The burger was lightly seasoned and I'd say the taste in the meat was mostly from the grill rather than seasoning. I think the key here is to get the chilli sauce on your hot dog or hamburger.  Even if you do get the chilli it's not aggressive, it's not going to make you think it's homemade and it's not going to win any chilli contest. It's also not likely to give you heartburn which is a plus.
Lastly, the chilli cheese fries came out less warm than you would expect. This could be due to the wait time. We went on a Saturday at about 630PM and there was a sizeable line and we waited about 15 minutes to get our order.< /review>< Pics>

This place is old school.
Chili Cheese burgers,  Chili Fries,   milkshakes
and...     a plethora of other tasty goods

not sure how healthy it is,   but hey       BETTER than McDonald's.< /Review>
