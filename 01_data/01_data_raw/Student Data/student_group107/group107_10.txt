<Review>I was helped by two wonderful women who saw me struggling to move all my things into my unit. Not only were they polite, very informative, patient, and kind with me. They helped me find my unit and even took the time to come show me exactly where it was at again! (Its a pretty big maze of units) but I felt safe nonetheless. The ladies went above and beyond for me here and I am forever grateful for the kind gesture that they did for me that day. I was going through alot emotionally and they saw that and really actually helped. Thankyou very much and I highly recommend this storage space for everyone :) they even made sure my unit was nice and clean before moving my belongings into it! I was paying double the price at public storage and I was not helped or given great service like this! They also are running a special for 50% your first two months! And you can use your OWN lock which is not price gouging like these other places! Thankyou very much again!</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Michelle is horrible!!! I can't believe someone would actually trust her to run the facility. She is rude, disrespectful, and useless. My husband's father had a stroke and we have power of attorney to take care of his affairs. He now lives in the bay area, so we are moving his things to be closer to him. We spoke to Amy on the phone and sent her a copy of the power of attorney papers. Then she asked for a note from the doctor. THEN she asked for a letter from the caregiver. After providing all the documents they requested we drive to the storage facility. We live in Sacramento so we have to rent a Uhaul and get a hotel for Saturday night. We arrive at the storage facility and Michelle refuses to let us in because she is unable to check emails after 5 pm on Friday, and we had to wait till Monday. All she had to do is scroll down. She refused to let us talk to anyone else, and offered no solution. Additionally, before we went to the storage facility we told her we needed a locksmith. You think she would have told us that the locksmith wouldn't be there that day. At the end of the trip, we had to pay for an extra day in the hotel, an extra day for the Uhaul, and a locksmith. All this because Michelle can't scroll down when checking emails, and can't pick up the phone and call the owner.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
WOW! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! BEWARE!  Had a rental reservation for a uhaul and tried to call to confirm it.  I told the operator that calls herself a "manager", Michelle that my reservation is for Sunday and gave her my last name.  She told me she doesn't have that reservation.  I asked her if she is looking at the right date and told her its for Sunday.  Then, she gets very offended that I even asked that question and hangs up on me. WHAT?!? It was a simple question.  I go to find out she went as far as to even cancel my reservation.  I never even spoke to her before in my life. Her attitude and customer service is by far the worst I have ever encountered from any company.  I will never give this place my money again and I hope no one else will either.</Review>

I'd improve the gate hours.
Not convenient.  6- 6:30pm
People want to stop by after work.
Places like A-1 or Extra space storage have 6am to 10 pm
When people have to move, they are looking for storage which stays
open late. They lose lots of business.  Moving companies do not like EZ storage or QUEST.
Hours are really bad
3 -4 bedrooms take all day to move. So storage have to have options. Give people the gate
Pass Code to move in, for maybe one day, 24 hours.
That would be smart business decision.</Review>

This review is for Tara.
As a regular auction buyer I have never been treated the way I was treated at this location.
Very Rude Employee not following the companies policy.
As an auction purchaser we are required to return personal items to the office so their previous owner can pick them up.
When I came in the office with a bag of personal items, Tara requested that I get rid of them, as in throw them away. I insisted on the fact that she should keep them because it is unfortunate for someone who’s lost all their items in storage to also loose their personal items like family photos, family Video recording and more. These are usually of sentimental value to the person who had them.
After insisting they should keep them for their rightful owner Tara and another employee went over the items I left and insisted i should take with me some of the items including VHC Video recordings with the person name on them with a family event date and also some other items like a membership ID card and employee name tag...
Seems like they don’t care much about these items. Their reasoning was that people never come to pick up their items. Im surprised an employee would reject theses items even though it is within the company policy.</text>

<text>This place is Criminal. They have no upper management to help assist issues. The contract I signed did not include any of the added fees and penalties they threw at me once they locked me out of my unit with no warning!! There was a huge misunderstanding in communication and no one to help resolve it. I would never recommend anyone to this Place even for a discount! No way!<//text><name>Rachel Arellano</name>< Date>

I have rented storage units from several other facilities, but none were as easy as EZ Storage. The staff is super friendly, the facility is unbelievably clean, hallways were will lit, and the process couldn’t have been easier or faster.</Text>

Staff is very kind. I used them for a uhaul rental. Even though I called 45 min before closing time, they were able to get me what I needed. I got there after closing time and they still waited for me. I definitely recommend  them and will go back.< /Text>

Trying a subway for Friday night dinner. Service was fast and friendly. The food is fresh and my steak sandwich was pretty good. I like it toasted and it was just right with extra melty cheese. Good experience.< /text>

Asked for extra cheese, shredded & swiss, told him twice "extra"... Put 2 little slices and small handfull of shredded... And then wanted to charge me for the "extra cheese". Didnt like that this time the wrap was different than all the other times I've been in this store!! Everyone else is amazing and friendly, but this guy, who didnt have his name tag, is the reason for my 1star..

I have had a lot of issues in the past with this Subway.  I took a chance this morning to go again and am glad I did.   It has really cleaned up and the young man that helped me was friendly.   I will go back.   Love the chopped salads.< /Text>

< review>
The very beautiful and sexy manager that works in the morning is very skilled at taking great care of the restaurant and customers. She always has great well trained staff. Especially Ramon who is a top notch sandwich artist and a great young man. Customer service is something that obviously comes natural to him and it shows. He is definitely going to move up in the ranks Im sure. I can easily see him as a manager soon I'm sure and later even a franchise owner. I must also mention someone who I have only just met working there but was quite a person and that is another beautiful woman with haunting light brown eyes named Amy. She was awesome. All in all a great place to visit. Finally, Kudos to the owner who also was very friendly and personable the couple times I was there while he was and he helped me. He definitely knows how to hire great managers and employees. I hope he appreciates how exceptional they are.--Late Night(wee hours) Sandwich Eater.😀</review>

Good fast service at this Subway restaurant. Sometimes I stop by on the way home, and get a bite. Right now (Jan. 2018) they have 4 different foot long subs for 4.99. I got the Italian & the black forest German sub. Both were good. No sales tax eather, because it is ready to eat food. A good deal.< /review>

I asked why the olives weren't on display as I've seen at other Subways & she said it was due to the owner's directive because he didn't want customers to ask for them because they were expensive to buy...I have not returned & will not.

<review>Night time crew donabgreat job of keeping things running smoothly. On occasion midnight locals may rampage into the restaurant they always know how to react in a speedy and effective manner. While this may be the few flaws I see, the service and employees show great efficiency as well as create a great ambience for their employees.< /review>< Gmap_id>

This location is open 24 hours. I always get the steak egg & cheese sandwich, at all hours of the night.

But today i went in at 1:20am, and they said they can only sell breakfast after 4am? They use to sell it to me befor. Why the sudden change?

Why cant they just make a steak & cheese sandwich, and just add the egg?
They microwave the egg anyways.<//review>

Worst experience every.    Came in with family.    After work.      Ordered 20$ worth of. Food. Didn't notice they only accept 20$ bills.    Had nothing but 100$ bills.    Asked a couple of customers for change ...       Couldn't get no change ..      I couldn't eat.   Just my luck .  Thnks subway< /Review>

< Review>
while I'm waiting in line one of the workers is on her break seating talking to a friend.   She goes back to work, touches stuff around, her friend comes back hands her a hat. she grabs the hat, she's also coughing.

she just puts on gloves and asks me what I want. ... I say you haven't watch your hands.... her respond is she's wearing gloves and she cough into her arm.   WFT! Wash your HANDS!!<//Review>

<text>Pretty good spot. It's only a three star because of the hummus bar, which is a restaurant in it. On it own, the hummus bar is a 5 star. The rest if the shops don't seem to have much action, as in people don't seem to go in them too much. So I'm assuming that they aren't that good.</text><time>1519423823756< /time>< response>

Hummus Bar & Grill.

Awesome food.  Fresh bread served all day long.  Be careful not to fill up on the bread so you can enjoy great kabobs and chicken  shawarma  is must try.<//Text>

<text>Tight, free parking on the street street level and a mix of interesting stores and restaurents. There are two covered, designated spaces for handicap parking.

Underground parking is free and can keep your vehicle cooler in hot weather.

Everything is wheelchair accessible. Ventura Boulevard is a very busy street. Metered street parking is difficult.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2990e64a2d057:0x1358bcf6c068018b<//GmapID>< user_id>

I was there eating at Israel Hummus Grill, my favorite Israel restaurant in the city of Tarzana.

Ha mis ah da Israel Hummus Grill, ha oovah sheli.  Ha okhel taeem meod, mah mash tov.

I love the food and  I like that the owners and employees are really Jewish and speaking perfect Hebrew (Ivrit).</Text><rating>5<//rating>< Date>

<review>now coming here to the Tarzana Village is a nice little small place i honestly feel like you could blink and miss the place i dont see a lot of foot traffic here but the do have a very very good urgent clinic here that is my favorite place (not like i wanna go to an urgent care but you know what i am saying ) it is very clean and service about and they do have a underground parking which is nice as well so id say check it out you may like it< /review>< time>

Two very nice restaurants in one small strip mall: Kushiyu, a sushi place, with excellent sushi although quite pricey (their lunch menu is a good deal though), and Hummus Bar, a great Israeli restaurant famous for their home made pita bread.< /Review>

Beautiful KOA. The nicest I have ever seen. So clean and no dust due to all gravle surface. Nice laundry room showers and bathrooms all spotless. Everything works like it should and friendly and helpful staff. Would rate it 10 stars if I could.<//text>

Beautiful campground! The staff is very friendly and they go above and beyond to make your stay the best way possible. They even opened the pool up for our daughter's! Sites are plenty big for our 40ft 5th wheel. Campground is orderly and kept clean. The views are amazing and at night it gets very quiet to the point you can hear the cows from the distance. It's right off the highway but the road noise is to a minimum. They even have trails to explore and the pet area is nicely maintained. The nearest WalMart is 27mins away and Ace Hardware etc. Carsen city is 40mins away if your looking for more options like Home Depot, In and Out. burger, Target etc.< /Text>

Amazing views, small town and Great Customer Service. We will be back. Grounds are beyond clean and very well maintained. You can tell they truly care about what they do. We will be back. John and his wife were amazing and shocked that John actually took us to our spot. While there we noticed staff actually helping other campers set up. Amazing!  Customer Service. I would give them a 10 out of 10. The owners are super cool and are very involved in the KOA as well. You can tell they care.  Thank you for our week stay - we will be back.<//text>

This KOA is a 10 out of 10!!!! Absolutely lovely. Clean, easy to navigate, peaceful and the owners are incredible. They wonderfully helped us get sorted and couldn't have been kinder. Thank you Tim and Scott. We look forward to visiting you MANY more times!! ❤️</Review>

I had a reservation for a tent site because I camp out of the back of my truck. They said I could stay because I didn’t have a tent. I asked for an RV site. They said I couldn’t stay because I didn’t have an RV. I have stayed in numerous other KOAs and they have always accommodated me. I went down the road to Willow Springs campground and the greeted me in a friendly manner and found a spot for me. The lady at the front desk was very nice to me, but the younger guy was rude.<//review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>This KOA is immaculate and the cliffs are beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. The owners, Scott and his partner, who zip around continually on their noisy little carts on gravel were officious, annoying, and rude, which made our stay uncomfortable and uneasy. Scott charged up to us while we were cooking at the camp kitchen and without greeting, accused us of having only divulged two people in our party at check in when we actually had three (our son), and stated he was going to charge us for the third person. We knew otherwise and later checked our receipt showing three people. Scott's partner zipped by, and we stopped him to show the receipt, which he rudely brushed off, saying they had already handled it, without apology or barely the time of day. Both men drove by on the noisy gravel repeatedly throughout the evening and early morning like little camp guards, which was pretty annoying. As long as you don't have to interact with those two, you should have a nice stay.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80977eae89810ec1:0xe60d558583609059</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>We have never been here before and advertisements are sometimes not accurate. This campground exceeded our expectations. The grounds are immaculate. The Staff is all very friendly and they will spoil you from wanting to go anywhere else. There are unlimited things to do at the campground and locally. There are even hotel room buildings scattered on the property if you dont have an RV or want to tent camp. The buildings blend in and don't spoil the views. I cannot recommend this place enough but dont tell everyone or it will get to popular and we wont be able to get reservations when we want to !!< /review><name>B Fisher< /name>< response>

The family and I love this place and are here often. The bathrooms, laundry room, pool, playground, game room, and other amenities are very clean and well maintained. We have stayed in the camp ground in our trailer and in a couple of different rooms in the hotel. We have always had a pleasant experience. The new owners are constantly making updates and improvements. We had good experiences with the previous owners and the new owners have also been great to work with. If you are visiting in the summer, Walker Burger and Mountain View BBQ are great places to eat and are about five minutes down the road in Walker. The restaurants are seasonal though, so they may be closed if you visit close to winter. Fly fishing in the Walker river is great and there are public waters about ten minutes up the road. Walker Coffee Company recently opened in Walker and the owner, Scott, is a fishing and hunting guide for the area. Walker Coffee also sells some flies and tackle. There are also countless 4X4 trails nearby and the Eastern Sierra ATV Jamboree is held in this area every year in September. Make sure you book in advance if you want to come in September as all the local hotels and campgrounds are usually booked up. The wifi here was recently upgraded and is pretty fast. I believe you can also pay additional to get access to an even faster wifi if you want. I've heard AT&T doesn't have great cell service here, but I have Verizon and get decent service. We have a signal booster in our trailer and that boosts it to full bars for us. We are active duty military and the owners, and this area in general, are very friendly and supportive to military.< /Review>

Our Rv club made reservations several months ago. Due to California restrictions related to Covid 19 circumstances changed to the point that this campground would not be adequate for our needs. My complaint, under the circumstances, is that the owner would not refund our entire deposit. Pretty good racquet I would say.<//review>

My fiance and I were looking to get out of Reno for a few days we needed to get away. We showed up after closing time but there was still a gentleman here to help us we paid for 3 nights and paid about as much for those three nights as we would have for one night on a weekend at a hotel in cheap motel he was nice patient and willing to answer any questions we had the prices were cheaper than what we had been quoted over the phone by almost $10 there's power at every site there's a pool there's fire pits sinks picnic tables is the perfect little getaway</review>

We love this KOA. The campgrounds are clean and well maintained. The property was recently purchased by New owners. They were super nice and helpful. There isn't a kids club at this location but my four kids had a great time swimming, catching lizards, and making smores. The highway and the cows make a lot of noise. But I'm thankful as I believe that's what probably makes these prices so amazing. We fall asleep easily and sleep through pretty much anything, so it's not a problem for us. But if you are a light sleeper, be sure to get a spot away from the road. Those cows are incessant.< /text>

<Text>Wow! What a great place. We stayed here from Friday to Monday on Memorial Day weekend 2019. Great hospitality, very level RV sites, super clean restrooms and showers. Our boys had a great time playing in the play area and meeting new friends. This valley is beautiful to say the least. We drove to Walker, CA. and took the last road heading East before hitting the highway again. This took us to East Side Ave which goes along the East side of the valley. We took Topaz ave back to the 395 and let me tell you, the scenery is absolutely amazing. Beautiful picturesque, snowy mountains, grazing cattle, and a view of the entire valley.  The only downside was getting there due to road closures of the 108. We had to take the 88 over Carson Pass which, is beautiful, but hard on my truck pulling a 31' travel trailer. But all in all, it has been a great trip. The restaurant is closed. And by closed, I mean no longer in business. My wife and I are considering moving here and opening up the restaurant here next to the KAO. Funds pending.<//Text>< username>

Very Clean, they appear to be updating the park with the new owners and are doing a fantastic job. This is our 2nd time to this park and will definitely be back. Love the area. Hoping the restaurant gets new owners would be a plus.< /Text>

Very clean, but ask for a camp site away from the road. Those sights are very close to 395 and are very noisy. Of course the ones farther away are more money. The place is very nice, clean and staff was friendly. But get a site map and ask for one away from 395.<//Text>

<review>The camp site is good and has easy access to restrooms. Location is main positibe point for this campground as from here one can cover lake tahoe in one day and next day you can head to yosemite valley via mono lake and tenaya lake.</review>< userid>

We were coming from a few days of boondocking above Lone Pine, and The Coleville/Walker KOA was the perfect stop on the way back to the Bay Area. We were delighted by the beauty, elegance, and cleanliness of the place. Our pull-through site was perfectly level, so we just put the stabilizers down  on the Airstream, filled our water tank, and plugged in the electricity. Highly recommended!< /Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Even if the place is directly on the street, it is not too loud here. The KOA staff is typically very, very nice and helpful. The showers and toilets are super modern and very clean. The store has everything you need. Firewood can be delivered to the site free of charge on request. The pool is very nice with lounge corner and loungers, from here you have a great view of the cliff. We had a deluxe patio site with chairs, table, BBQ and gas firepit. Not cheap, but really nice!

Auch wenn der Platz direkt an der Straße liegt, ist es hier nicht allzu laut. Das Personal ist KOA typisch sehr sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Die Duschen und Toiletten sind super modern und sehr sauber. Der Store hat alles, was man benötigt. Feuerholz wird auf Wunsch kostenlos zur Site geliefert. Der Pool ist sehr schön mit Lounge Ecke und Liegen, von hier hat man einen tollen Blick auf das Kliff. Wir hatten eine Deluxe Patio Site mit Stühlen, Tisch, eigenem BBQ und Gas-Firepit. Zwar nicht günstig, allerdings wirklich schön!< /Review>

Great customer service. Their staff are knowledgeable and so helpful. I couldn't find this particular hinge for my desk. I took a photo and their rep was able to look it up and order it.<//Review>

<text>They have it in stock, they have the knowledge about the product and they are very nice people. The building itself looks like it has been there for quite a while and the inside is packed full of all kinds of stuff. I travel across the Bay to come here and I'm never disappointed.< /text>< Date>

Though I wish I didn't have to write that review to finally get heard, I appreciate y'all taking care of me today and replacing my saw.
I will continue to shop there.

These folks certainly care about you and your project. This is the place where the local contractors go for all their supplies and advice.  I've gotten help with many projects. Simply the best; especially if you're like me and really don't know what you need to get something done, these folks will help you.

They have a great return policy as well. Great people. Great store.<//Review>< pictures>

This place is astounding. They have more of the random little parts and tools that you'll need than your average hardware store. Better selection than HD. Less cavernous feeling than ACE. Love it<//text>

<Text>Jackson's has been a great place for me to get any last-minute job related needs. I come down to San Rafael every June for work, and we almost always need something on the job site. Jackson's is a reliable place to find anything hardware wise that I might need. The customer service is accommodating and willing to troubleshoot with you to find solutions for your hardware needs.</Text>< pictures>

If one of them can't answer your question, they will find or call someone who does.

Jackson's is an old school hardware store-- in the very best of ways.  They carry an array of modern designer products for remodeling, and 10000's of products that become the solutions to your honey do list.  But, it's the customer service that elevates Jackson's above the rest of the San Rafael hardware stores--these folks go above and beyond to help you find what you need.  John in the rental department helped me source substitute replacement parts for a piece of business equipment I brought in.  He was helpful, efficient and got me back to work in no time. Thanks Jacksons for the excellent customer service!< /Review>

Went in to replace a sink plunger. 1) not the friendliest folks, pretty cold. 2) seemed irritated that he had to find the part. 3) when he did find it, he had no interest in helping me understand how to install it, which I could figure out, but figured he might have some tips. And lastly when it seemed like the part he had would not work, he had no interest in finding out what part would. Generally, not a place for getting help or advice.</review>

Older gent forgot to give me my receipt for a Dremel bit and Flitz in the tool area.  As I left the alarm goes off.  Some cashier tried to play tough calling me back into the store, so I humor him.  This guy isn't together enough to speak to the older gent in the tool area and barks him over on the phone.  My purchase is confirmed, I felt really bad for the old guy that had to hobble to the front.  Tough guy, I didn't bother with, and left.  I can see why people don't like this store.  They should have continued dealing with tradespeople, they do not have it together to deal with the public.  If you need it now, can't wait for an Internet order, there are many other places that have employees that arent frustrated and angry laborers manning the cash register, and acting as security.</Text>

Fun bar...Nothing fancy.  A basic bar and a good place for a few drinks.  The special was a free Sol beer with purchase of a shot of tequila.  One customer asked for a fancy multi-ingredient cocktail and the bartender (I believe his name was Parker) responded, "We serve drinks with up to 3 ingredients...ice is one of them."  Go if you like a fun no-nonsense bar and a some funny, sassy sarcasm from the bartender. If you're fussy, needy and thin-skinned don't go, you'll hate it.</Text>

<Text>God's honest bar. Dont go in with the mentality that you need to be served. They take care of the simple man and the people looking for a drink. I couldn't have asked for more when my wife and I walked in. They were welcoming and earnest. Possibly the most genuine people we've met in California. Please don't go in if you're thin skinned. And be sure a game of Liar's cup is gonna happen. Couldn't be happier. Thanks Frank!!< /Text>< pics>

The carved sign says cocktails. The ambiance screams local dive bar. Both great indicators of at the very least, an interesting experience. It doesn't have to be a fantastic drink but work with what you have. Our initial experience was a walk by on our way to dinner, the bartender was pleasant and let us know that they serve simple drinks and are open late (2am). When we returned, a different bartender did nothing but insult my wife and I and eventually refused to serve us even though we were simply asking what we did to offend him.

If you're looking for a place that is trying to stay relevant and to be the "blue collar" Carmel, then this is the place for you. Totally unoriginal rip off of an episode of Shameless, this place will do nothing to enhance your experience of Carmel.

This place might be for you if you're looking to have unsolicited insults hurled your way if you don't dress, act, speak, or look middle class white generic, appearing in a way that makes the bartenders subjectively feel better about their rock bottom place in life.

The unfortunate part is that this place thrives off bad reviews and even encourages them. Catering to the two local, middle aged people at the bar, the Carny bartender mentioned three times that we were millennials and should leave Yelp reviews.

Save yourself time and hassle and just walk by knowing that you are better than the scum bag, local patrons and trolls that are employed there.

As a result of this place we will not return to this tourist trap city. Everything is over priced, over promised and takes itself way too seriously.< /text>

<Text>My colleagues and I stumbled into this tiny bar on a Thursday evening and I'm so glad we did. Parker is friendly, funny, handsome, AND a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers fan. He played about ten TPATH songs while we were there and shared that he was meant to attend one of the Berkeley shows but it was postponed to a date he couldn't make. It was totally cool talking with an actual fan as I'm still grieving the sudden death of my favorite rock and roll legend. The locals were welcoming, and being there had me dreaming of moving to Carmel upon retirement. Thanks Parker and friends, last night was the highlight of my time in your little town.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The worst place I have ever been in my life. The completely racist, old, drunk, bigot that runs this dump just wanted a fight. Not only does he seemingly hate everyone who isn't a Trump supporting white American male he doesn't even know his own history very well. If an old American fool is going to get Anti British and argumentative at the sound of an accent he better at least get his facts right. Sadly this idiot was just offensive and quite frankly a little too thick to converse with. I would avoid this dump like the plague. I am not the only reviewer who has said this about this place. You were warned!!!!<//Review>< pics>

A place like no other. If you are offended easily skip this one.  I cracked up at the bizarre commentary being dealt, some at my expense.  Crotichy old guy who loves sports and people... not so much. Has a soft spot for pups though.  Lol. I willingly go back for more razzing. Lol.</review>

It's a local bar. If you're not a local don't expect the red carpet. Great vibes.</review>

Nice little dive for a cold beer. Map doesn't properly show the location. It's on Lincoln south of Ocean.</Review>

I will never go to this place. The Bartender refuses to give people a cup of water. I went with my friends it was around 2am and asked for a cup of water and he refused to give me one and had a nasty attitude. Bad business< /Review>

<Text>Best Italian deli in San Francisco. Even though it's in the far south of the city it's worth the trip. The sandwiches are large enough for two meals. Plus they have racks of Italian foods and wines as well as cheeses and homemade cannoli.<//Text>< rating>

Always enjoy this place.  Great specialty sandwiches and Italian goods.  Next time I've gotta try some of the homemade refrigerated pasta to go.  Here's the sandwich menu.< /review>

Great place to go. Best sandwiches in S.F. This is the best place in S.F to go and get fresh Italian delicacies unless you live in North Beach. Always a great selection of items, and Sal and Mayra are both extremely friendly and helpful. I try to not buy sandwiches anywhere else, because they just don't measure up to Calabria Bros.< /Text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>First of all. I can't believe I have not stopped in here earlier in my life.  How could I miss this GEM.  This is my second time coming here after yesterday because I wanted to try their breakfast and egg salad sandwich.  YUM! Yes the fat kid is strong within.  Yesterday I was walking through mission on my way back from the tailors.  I always past this place paying no mind thinking it's just another sandwich shop.  But then I smelled this delicious aroma coming from there.  I was like WTF smells good!  Went in to check it out.  I was impressed with the layout and products they have in there.  It was so clean and organized.  Then I realized it's an Italian delicatessen shop.  No wonder why.  I LOVE Italian food.  I swear I feel like I was an Italian in my previous life.  The people was so nice and great customer service.  Grabbed me (2x) Mikey & Jessica to go.  Killed both in the same day.  Now I am back to grab breakfast and lunch.  What's great is the price.  I pay like $12+ for Roxie down the street.  Dont get me wrong Roxie is good.  But a good big sandwich for less is Awesome in my book.  Will be coming here more often.  Highly recommended!</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp9T4BVCDNZlzKKNkH7cMPKWot8WvXMRW1fhrH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMKxPmh-W0s1wk5MIVBvy95YMgo0LdGVSvK1zt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeP506ycNZLXfdiz7mMB0qCd4XUPtDWrKk94fD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcX28HCXBxkagtmPr4VFzas7YJrryG9gq5_ORJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmvIcvwVhGiJg50zAECQUSkaW5_NmgC4D8vzVW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxHq6-407XT-Gb3KsuJ4Z4XVspOnnE89Dkqf-P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPwB6S3iHV_FHJ7vHtYt6u30aqP2C4FvWwwzK_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRQxuVmsXyU5w9B7oLKnXsRBtKNc5cCDPs8_zU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoox1KanStKA5RTtbpBjQKqLz2qWO68wR5hfxp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><gmap_id>0x808f7e85978dd3f1:0xed79ff7bf90c50fe< /gmap_id><Time>1552759018535</Time><Name>Michael Lee DS<//Name><rating>5< /rating></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>As you've seen from previous reviews, this place gets a lot of attention because of its sandwiches. They're great - don't get me wrong (see photo) - but what you really need to know is that this place is a legit delicatessen. Like, hardcore sliced-to-order.

AMAZING selection of meats that you won't find elsewhere, especially at their reasonable prices. No need to specify the number on slicer...dude's a pro AND packages said meat accordingly.  If you hate the environment, ask for your meats to be wrapped separately, but know that all of us regular people will be scoffing at you behind our masks...

The only inconvenience here is they close pretty early so I have to load up on deli meats during my days off...

Awesome selection. Great customer service. Check this place out.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Just happened to need a quick lunch in the area--WOW!  I had  a modified Mikey and Jessie's sandwich and one half was a way better value--huge and delish-- than any other place in SF!  Brought the other half home to my husband and he fell in love with me all over again :)</Review>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><text>Honestly everything and more you expect out of an Italian deli. Wonderful atmosphere, fresh ingredients, a staff who is not only passionate and knowledgeable about their products but welcome you the first time you walk in as if you had been there a 100 times before and best of all the sandwiches....seriously for under  $10 you get the experience your mouth would never dream of (not to mention how large they are!). I don't think I could pick a better sandwich shop in the mission...hell even San Francisco! Go there Tuesdays for the fresh meatballs (which are delicious!).
Go there, it's off the muni and worth the trip no matter where you are.</text>< pics>

Up and going to Roxy's every Friday to buy my nephew a sandwich for lunch. Now. Calabria was introduce to me by my hair Salon LETS GET CUTE SALON ON MISSION. THE BARBER "KAT" . The minute you walk in the door they greet you. The way they make sandwiches there is second to none. The quality of the food is amazingthe people that work there are very amazing people especially the brother that always makes my sandwich. Viva Mexico 💯💯💯........ This Mexican brotha is the true definition #TopShelfService. I'll be in Cuba this upcoming Wednesday but the following Wednesday I'll be back and I'll be there God bless you guys have a wonderful week. so I have to say I rate this place five stars and for the way things are looking that's Robbie going to get my sandwich for me and my family from now on it's wrap............ #theyrockhard< /Review><Name>Mario Ruiz< /Name>< UserId.>

The sandwich place was amazing I remember when it was sorrentos the nephews that took over have done a amazing job keeping the quality of the sandwiches but also giving their place their own uniqueness with the sandwiches they have.The price is reasonable $10 for a monster sandwich fresh meat and bread made daily at the bakery next door I give this place five stars and recommend it to all sandwich lovers .<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>As ALWAYS this place was amazing. I can rarely get here now that I was forced out of area but whenever I can I do stop here. No Torrone in HP. Nope. Had I been able to afford one they've got Niman Ranch beef lasagna in freezer I was literally drooling over, and gnocchi too. I had my sammie, 2 bite sized Laflorentine nougats, smallest deli potato salad and chicken salad in my bag and get back to car in tears. These guys are the BEST. Someday soon I'm getting those gnocchi and lasagna. Reiterate....this place is the best.<//review>< pictures>

The sandwich was very good. The prosciutto was old and dry very dark red, he had to slice it very thick so it would stay together,The mortadella edges were crusty [ old]. The capocplla was old and end cuts. In a way it`s my fault because I know better not to buy it if you can`t see it before they slice it.All the cold cuts that they are going to sliced are behind the counter.I have never sent a review before, I hope this will save someone else from getting taken.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Let me tell you! Since Sorrento's first owners, I thought this place was never going to be the same. The second owners, despite their efforts ran Sorrento's into the ground! After hearing that they would be closing (no surprise, it was all a matter of time) I got really disappointed... I thought "Maaan! what is it going to be now? ANOTHER Asian restaurant?!" Well to my delightful surprise, Calabria Brothers bought it out and kept it as an Italian deli!

When I first walked in, I was taken aback a bit. I was used to the cluttered aisles full of Italian goods, but no longer. It was incredibly spacious! Even with tables and chairs to actually sit down and eat! It looked wonderful, they didn't sacrifice anything fully utilizing the floorspace there! Clean, spacious and very welcoming.

The one guy who prepares the sandwiches, I always forget to catch his name, is really friendly and makes the sandwiches flawlessly in my opinion.

The sandwiches are portioned VERY well, I have to say AND very reasonably priced! Opposed to the second regime of Sorrento's owners who began making their sandwiches much smaller and more expensive!

This really took me back to the old school Sorrento's. But, since it's been that long since I've had a decent Italian cut sandwich, I have to say that Calabria Brothers sandwiches are BETTER!

They have outstanding choices of meats and cheeses, even bread! Adding in Ciabatta and Wheat bread. The sandwiches all come with your choice of having mustard, mayo, salt, pepper, olive oil, home made vinegar, and their garlic/pesto spread. Honestly some amazing sandwiches!

I also can't forget, you can also get all your quality cold cuts and cheeses there too. They also do catering.

In sum, MOST awesome Italian deli around! You have to come and try it, and unless you're not a fan of big Italian deli sandwiches, you're going to love it!

Mangiare e godere!

<text>I expected a wider selection of lotions, based on input from 2 different people, (and maybe other locations do). I did see some unique items, which is what I enjoy. I liked this lion a lot.  Not much cooperation from customers regarding the floor guides for social distancing which was a bummer.  But store staff did limit number of customers and that's something.<//text>< Pictures>

Being a culinary student is tough right now, but I can always count on Homegoods to have ingredients and gadgets that take me to the next level. From truffle oil, and vanilla paste, to pasta kits  and pans, I truly appreciate all that you guys do for me! Please continue to stay safe and keep up the great work! The community, I am sure, appreciates you guys too! (P.S. Keep your eyes open for the pasta kits! They are wonderful!)< /Review>

< Review>
Awesome selection for great value! I've found so many awesome things here and all at affordable prices, so I really have nothing bad to say about the place.
As someone who loves giving practical gifts, this is the ideal place to shop, so many choices of awesome stuff that all have character of their own<//Review>

This newer HomeGoods started off strong and they haven't stopped.  The store is well managed - you often see the manager on the floor checking everything out and greeting customers - as well as well stocked.  They always have a good variety of everything from home items, decor, pictures and rugs to furniture. This past Christmas they had a large variety of Christmas decor - more then some of the other HomeGoods stores.  I always enjoy shopping there and would recommend the store.<//text>

Of all the “for less” stores home goods has some nice stuff and in large quantities as expected. If Ross or Marshall’s just doesn’t have the selection, chances are HG does. Prices are decent with some really good buys if you hunt around.< /Review>

Great prices and is always clean and organized by themes. Amazing for seasonal decorations and the selection for home items is superb. The art for the home also amazing.

Management and employees are top tier here.
I went in to purchase a set of furniture, the employee/greeter was quick to help me carry it and we noticed that it had slight damage, he quickly called over a manager who also reviewed the pieces. Manger then took the time to explain why/how it likely happened, as well as how I could fix it if I choose to. He then offered me a very 'generous' mark down due to the damages, all without me ever having to bicker or complain, they simply helped me out and ensured that I was satisfied. (This was on 7/7/20 6ish)
Employee/doorman then helped me load up the furniture and we were on our way.
Me and my girl friend are moving into our first place together and this was an extremely relieving and exciting experience as this was our first furniture purchase in what was a very lengthy and stressful process of moving.

I'm extremely grateful for their assistance and level of customer care, I will go out of my way to return to the store specifically and will spread the word to family and friends as well.
In addition this store actually does have a very good selection and is a little larger/laid out in a way that I prefer.</text>

Home Goods is a great place to shop. It has every kind of design elements that your looking for.  But like an amusement park..put on conformable shoes and tell anyone who cares that you'll be gone for a couple of hours and that PBJs are easily made...enjoy< /text>

Got a lovely smelling candle for only 10$ not bad for the size! It's a bit crowded with merchandise in there though! So be prepared to hunt for what you want. Great for walking around and browsing though!< /text>

<Review>Come and sift through the chaos to find home decor items.  Many things to pick from although some of the aisles cannot be attempted due to the overwhelming amount of goods strewn on the shelves and on the floor.  On the bright side, the clutter also can be seen as options every turn.  Seasonal decorators must visit.  Prices are surprisingly affordable.  Glad to have it locally.< /Review><user_name>S D</user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

Hana Sushi is a small, quiet sushi joint with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The staff are friendly,  knowledgeable and helpful if you're unsure of what to get. The sushi is always fresh and the ramen is excellent. Don't miss out, order one of their lunch specials to give it a try at a reasonable price and I'm sure you will come back for dinner.<//Review>

Found a new local sushi place and is as good as anywhere I have eaten. So nice not to have to go to the Valley or LA to get good sushi. Jake is as knowledgeable as any sushi chef I know!<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Extremely slow service, sat there for one hour, pretty much felt ignored, they had about 10 to go orders go right past us, and when another table got up and left, we left right after them, paid for our drinks and left with no food, very dissatisfied. This was a Monday evening, the restaurant is pretty empty, not that many people at the bar, extremely poor organization, very bad management<//text>< gmap_id>

I rarely give 5 stars to a sushi restaurant, but this place was amazing. I went during a quiet time, and had an enjoyable conversation with the sushi chef.  The fish was fresh, and everything was delicious.  I'll definitely be going back!</review>

My husband and I love eating at this Sushi restaurant. We love the authentic places. Our favorites are Spicy Tuna and Atlantis... The owners know our name and every time we come in, they greet us. We recommend this to anyone.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I am a Sushi guy but have to say I was incredibly disappointed when I first dined in this place. The owner was a jerk & his Halibut sucked so bad I couldn't even eat it and yes, we did not develop positive feelings for each other. Then there was a new owner. Now I'm really happy as I have a Sushi place practically next door; plus, the sushi is really good, even the Halibut! Miracles do happen...< /text>< Pictures>

Very good sushi, but like all sushi places, on the expensive side for anyone with a big appetite. They do have happy hour, though, which I have yet to try.

The other down side is that the restaurant is tiny.< /review>

They were pretty organized for an afternoon shopping trip!! They were well stocked, it was 4.00 day and the bins were full. Clerks were friendly and provided us with very quick service! We love to shop there!
Will go back many more times, Soo many good things, from car parts to women's underwear, food etc. You never know until you get there!!
Good luck & have fun! 💖< /text>

I would give this place an 7/10 for the "grabbag idea" of a store. Great sales. They absolutely don't enforce mask or social distancing protocols set by the county. 100% of the time 6ft distance or proper mask attire was not encouraged. The employees set the bar, so when they don't wear their mask when talking to customers, the customers will follow not taking the pandemic seriously.
*Not safe for people of all ages* They said they'd let in 100 people which is over the limit for a store of that size.</review>

Is it Falling prices or falling apart?  Why is It that in our presence as  loyal  customers, the employees seems to be making it hard for us to shop.  They bring out the boxes supposedly to refill the wooden bins but as they go along choosing the nicer items by checking the original prices from their phones and then they set it aside for whatever purposes, perhaps saving for their friends.  I’ve seen one girl handed out a nice stuff to another customer then when I ask for one she refused.  I paid  a year membership of $49 plus another fee depending what day hoping to get better items but even I was number 1 in the line the merchandise were  already preselected and set aside.  The hype and excitement like when they first introduce the store is no longer there.  I agree to comments that  dignity  is like taken away from us by the way the staff who doesn’t show any respect but to their friends or relatives they serve it like in a silver platter.

SO Disappointing and disgusting!< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Packages open products missing and sold as is.  Being told often to bring back carts even though I am a regular customer, and clearly not the one breaking the rules that so many others ignore! Too crowded, with many not observing the social distance rule or masks. The clear rule breakers are not approached as they should be. Food mixed in with chemical products leaking, it is unclear which products are affected or contaminated.  Parking is a nightmare, I was almost hit by a van attempting to leave the crowded parking lot, I now have a series of door dings on my car doors.  Female store manager is very rude person with long brown curly hair, so unprofessional when asked questions about the products, so snappy, as though you are bothering her.<//text>< Name>

It appears that face coverings are not a requirement at this store. Both staff and clientele were without face coverings in these COVID-19 times. I asked a staff member about it and she clarified that they are not a requirement.  I didn’t feel safe being in the store so I left. 😕</review>

Good prices when you can find something you need or want.  Never been on $6.00 day but I've found deals on other days.  Beware!  Do not leave your cart unattended even if you are still shopping.  The guard will throw your things back into the bins and point out this small handwritten sign scolding you for leaving your cart unattended.  Other than that, it's an adventure.< /text>

First time for the Tuesday morning check in & line up for the $6 scores.

I was #107, and I was in the door by 10:10. The line moved quickly, people were civil for the most part...it is a shame adults need to be told "you must line up by your number" and  "don't run in the store".

I am happy with my purchases and will venture back another day.  Kudos to the staff and security for a job well done.< /Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Went in yesterday and things have changed so much since a year ago. They used to have a new batch of items every Tuesday and it would start at $6 then the price would drop every day.
Now the items they think will sell for more seem like they're pulled aside to try and sell for $6 next week. You used to have a chance to get great deals on things later in the week if they hadn't been bought.
Most of the bins are full of clothes, drapes and bedding and you can't look through the bins very well. Just too crammed with cloth.
If I wanted to sort through clothes no one wants I'd have gone to a thrift store. It seems like they changed their whole business model. Really sad because we used to take in our kids and end up spending hundreds of dollars a month on cool items, snacks and cases drinks.
The staff are friendly but they keep condensing the bins so that they're so crammed it isn't worth even looking.
Maybe a new owner or manager took over that doesn't understand why this place was cool and changed things up to try and maximize profits.
I'll give it one more try but if the experience is similar to yesterday's I won't go back.</review><name>Scott Hopkins< /name>< UserId.>

A piece of advice: Don’t go there unless if you are agree to be degraded and insulted.
I was at the store on Tuesday. I stood in line. The security, who was standing at the door, started yelling at everyone in line over the speakerphone multiple times like we are his prisoners.
In addition, the lady manager was so rude and unprofessional treating people like mosquitoes.
I wanted to ask the store owner to read my post but it seems that he/she doesn’t care about what is going on in the store and how customers are being treated.
After that day, i promised myself not to go back at the store at all to save my dignity from being degraded.</review>

Considering how much of a mad house this place is(think black Friday shopping) the cashier was super friendly and informative. Managed to snag a $120 weighted blanket for $6. Highly recommend this place,  just make sure you get there early.</review>

<Text>Started out great the first few months, but now items you could get in bulk for 6.00 are now split up and are 6.00 per item such as crest used to be able to find a box of 3 for 6.00 now individual tubes are 6.00 or maybe less if you go on another day. The better items are snatched up by the first through the door and not as many of the better items as in the past. I was going every week sometimes twice a week now I go about once a month and the last couple of times left empty handed if I do find something its not worth waiting in line for. Maybe if they had a store in the South Sacramento Elk Grove area I would check it out more often but not worth the gas to drive across town for anymore.< /Text>< Pics>

Falling prices has brought the most business that I have ever seen in this particular location ever. It has also brought jobs and attracted other businesses to this location. I've been in Carmichael for 20 years and the only time I have seen an attraction like it is the parades marathons.  Thank you for being there for me and my family and friends. Without you it would be the same old homeless attraction.< /Text>

I visited falling prices today and I was excited to see all the cheap 25-cent merchandise so I can get my daughter and myself some nice but as soon as I walked in I was treated like I was not a customer but maybe an imposter treated and I hope that everyone else will feel the same way because first they are very judgemental I was accused for doing something I didn't do and then when I went to take a picture for the Google Maps contribution they were almost about to tackle me and take my phone out of my hand and they were stopped by a man of more understanding I honestly believe that their security is just a little too over staff today I just experienced the worst experience I've experienced in Fallout prices all because and they said I was taking too long and I haven't bought anything yet and Google Maps will tell me exactly how much time I've been in there<//Text>

As you know
Tuesday starts at $6.00
Wednesday $4.00
Thursday $2.00
Friday 1.00
Saturday 0.25
Sometimes in the early morning when the store opens there is a very long line of people waiting to enter. There are shopping carts to use while shopping. Once inside the store, you will see large wooden boxes, they are filled with items. Some items may not be worth what you can purchase them in a regular store. Some items my be less than what they would cost in a regular store. Some of the food items have expired dates on them and some don't. There are household items,toys, food,clothes, office supplies and much more. Every day the merchandise changes, you never know what will be for sale. Thursday I bought 4 decks of Bicycle playing cards for $2.00. Think of it as a treasure hunt, be careful when buying items here stop and think what would it cost in a regular store.< /Review>

I love shopping here!  It's an a giant treasure hunt!  I don't bother with rushing in for a shopping cart(limited supply) I take a big blue Ikea bag.  Once the initial rush subsides, a cart becomes available pretty frequently.  There are some rude shoppers though, just don't let them ruin your adventure.  Have fun and happy shopping!</review>

<text>It has good deal  bargains but you got to get a number, which is handed out to you at the back of the store @7 am and store doesn’t open till 10 am. But beware that food is expired date of manufactured. Also very aggressive costumers willing to push and shove others for getting things. Store is not organized, no refunds or returns.<//text>< name>

This was my 2 ND time at this store. If the 3rd time is anything like the 2nd trip it will be my LAST trip. It was 2.00 day and there was nothing in the store worth anything more than .50 On top of half of the store was closed off.<//Review>

Who ever suggested this place doesn't exist is wrong. I've never seen that question on Google before. When I looked up the hours today, Google said a user suggested this place doesn't exist and asked me if they were correct. Weird, I've been to it and have made purchases three times since they opened. What kind of  portal am I stepping through that they're not? Get on the ball, the address is the same as Hogwarts. If you know, you know. Just go to the train station and look for it. But not if you're a Muggle. They can't find it.</review>

The way they clajm the store works is Tuesdays everything in the store is $6.  What doesn't sell that day will be $4 the next day then $2. Friday eveything left is $1 and Saturday is 25 cent day. What they don't tell you is that they cheat. First everything starts in boxes so for example a case of 40 waters $6. But 25 cent day they break the water case down and you now get a bottle of water for the 25 cents. Or.... They take the case of water off the floor on $2 day and hold it till $6 day. I figured this out because there was a pallet of soda machines at closing on $2 day. I was there when they opened the next morning they Were gone.</Text>

I really like falling prices there is nothing else like it  I live in Carmichael and I just stumbled across this place  I never heard anything about a new store opening at all nothing so I was shocked to see the hoards of people and the full to the max parking lot and blown away when I entered falling prices the first time it's hard to describe it but at least 50boxes 4'+8' full of Amazon's returned items anything that Amazon sells could be in these boxes and it is like gold fever and people not all but most have lost all there manners and turned into anamals only care of themselves and it a a real sad thing that people can step out of the person they are and act like that and not be botherd by it is upsetting  to witness but they just return do it some more  I avoid any of the aggressave people people that come close.lm there trying to have fun digging for treasure but with these hiennas  lurking it ruins the coolest thing I've ever seen at a store before< /text>

You will find products that normally cost a lot
But you can find it at less of the normal cost
Like Acure brightening lotion for your face 100% vegan at $4.00 on Wednesday and if you are lucky at $2.00 on Thursday and some other stuff like
Curel body wash, Toms toothpaste, Next generation laundry detergent, method cleaners,
Deodorants, Aveeno lotions, baby shampoo, blind for your Windows and so much much much more</Review></record>

Buffet food and the atmosphere here is very good. Great place to relax, people watch, eat good food or all the above.  Really nothing but enjoyable experiences here, I'll be back. It has a cool feel to it.</Text>

The lunch menu is all bad.  The choice is small, the food does not taste fresh.  Seafood Salad with Pasta.  Seriously ?  Broccoli salad was sweet as a dessert. Baked potatoes were dangerous.  They did not try.  It was possible to eat only soups.  they are not bad.  I also remembered the sticky floor.  Not nice.  Wasted time and money.< /text>

<text>The food was great and the options were quite good however it is missing some item that should be always there but overall it was good and I definateñy will comeback.

Ps. Needs more promotion and maybe coupons to encourage customer to go because the place is quite hidden.<//text><Rate>4</Rate><Date>1503494035009<//Date>< Resp>

<review>Classic Hometown Buffet. One of the last ones in San Diego. The food was good, it was $30 for 2 adults with only water to drink (our 2 year old was free). No one hassled us about wasting a lot of food or lingering for quite a long time. Ate a lot and still felt full the next day. Wasn't too busy and was clean enough. Nothing mind blowing here. Basic buffet with good service.< /review>< pics>

Menu for breakfast is wide enough and good flavor. Place is clean. * Only one suggestion: since there is no a waitress taking away the plates you're done, then try to serve small portions to try before having a big portion, and try to reuse your plates, that way you don't have many plates seated on your table with much left overs.<//review>

The food was awful! 😥As my family celebrating a birthday. The service is great. However the food was terrible. The Taste, dried leftover freezer taste of the fish. The food. Easily you can see did not look fresh at all. I feel sick from eating my food.< /review>

<Text>4 star because I think that should put more food. There are at least 20 types of food but the options to eat run out so fast.
However, the food is really really good and you can have a great time in the place with good attention.< /Text>< pics>

It's okay. Nothing spectacular in fact very very average. Price was around 14 for lunch which is pretty good. I'd probably choose another buffet with more selection.</text>

< Review>
Rice crisp lacks sweetness, beverages in a cappuccino machine needs to be refilled(taste nothing but water), sprite and some beverages in soda machine needs to be refilled(taste like water), corn on hot bar lacks flavor, cookie dough is overcook(burnt taste and hard edges). And it would be better if they put some label for the ice cream cones on the corner for those people who wonders where it is.</Review>

I wrote a review that said the place was dirty, food was old and not appetizing and poor service, this place has been in decline for years, and keeps getting worse, I happened to notice none of the negative reviews are answered only ones that heap praise well I have been going here on and off for 30 years am more than qualified to review restaurants because I'm an Executive chef toj people need to get a grip on your place if your getting praise it's the first hour you open not at 7 pm when I've been 3 times and is worse everytime  the sad thing is you cant admit  your mistakes or your downfall good luck<//Text>

I never cared for the place so didn't give it much thought. Then a friend highly recommended trying it again because it had really changed.  So, my lady and I went on Father's Day to try it out.  We were pleasantly surprised. It was very clean, the help was very polite, the manager was very nice, everyone was courteous and helpful. The food was displayed  nicely and tasted very good. They cooked the steak the way you wanted it, fruit was in individual  dishes and everything had a great flavor.  We have since been back 3 times and every time the same thing. I have told all my friends about how good the food is, how nice we were treated and everything has been improved since I was here a year ago.  I will return.

<Text>I am very disappointed with the direction this buffet is heading to. It used to be my place to go for lunch back in days but now food don’t taste the same as before. We paid $28 (fair) for 2 people for lunch but the products didn’t meet our expectation. The management must do a deep control over their cookers otherwise they will loose customers in a near future.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Employees were VERY RUDE. The older woman at the "carvery" was the most rudest employee out of all of them. She'd smile at every customer before me, serving them hefty size portions but when it came to me, her facial expression dropped and she CONSTANTLY gave me smaller portions AFTER giving me some attitude after I'd politely ask for whatever I wanted. ( I didn't do anything to provoke her). When my boyfriend came to see for himself, he even got to see that I wasn't overreacting. The servers weren't picking up the plates but instead we're conversation within other employees. Foods were cold, bland, and sitting out to the point they started to dry out.
*MOST IMPORTANT* While I was at the salad bar, the female employee used her bare hands to put vegetables into its separate bins. Digging her hands into the bins to get the veggies out and what not. No matter what, an employee should be wearing gloves or use the tongs. "No big deal"... How do you know if she even washed her hands? Not good when SD recently had a hepatitis A break out due to lack of hygiene...< /text></record>

The lady working the tables did not welcome us and let plates stack up on our tables. Had no room to eat after a while, so I put the empty plates on the table next to me. She did not like that.

To be honest, I would give this zero stars because the food was horrible, there’s not a variety of food that you can choose, most of the food was used food cause some of the food is rock hard, so if you’re thinking of going to a buffet, I would very recommend anyone to go to another buffet than this one. Not coming back<//Review>

<Review>I'm writing a long review take the time to read please. I'm taking time to write this.  In from LA for my daughter's volleyball tournament. Wanted to go out for a nice dinner feast with the family. driving from sorrento valley to the first hometown 27 minutes away in san Diego, which it was closed down Google failed to notify about this. Then we drove to the second hometown 14 more minutes away 5.1 miles in Chula vist. Hardly anyone inside that should of been the first sign. The food was very old looks like been there since 12 noon. Absolutely no taste whatsoever, believe me when I say my dog wouldn't even eat the steak. The servers do get the plates very frequently. Because no one is in there.
Hometowns are far and few between. This is why most are closed down. I will say I did order a fresh medium steak after calling over the manager I did get it but it took a little over 10 minutes to get it. My wife ordered a medium well she got hers a few minutes after mine. They were the best thing we had. And that's not saying much. Try yummy buffet. If your not big on Asian cuisine. Thanks for taking time out of your busy day to read.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This place isn't what it used to be in the days of Rogelio. The carpet is so dirty that it sticks to your shoes. Too many forks are bent and look like they are flipping you off with one tooth up. They got rid of the horchata and still don't carry any flavored creamer.
Food is blah. This place needs a remodel and a new caring manager.<//Review>

< review>
Decent food tonight. Just don't go in before closing cuz they will kick you 10 minutes after they stop admitting people. The business hours tonight were 11a.m. to 8:30p.m. So if you show up at 8:20p.m. they will gladly take your money, but you only get about 20 minutes to eat. They even start to pull certain items from the flooír, like desserts, before 8:30. The staff also makes it super uncomfortable by mopping around the buffet islands making you feel like a jerk for serving yourself. Let alone the slip hazard. I wonder if the owner is aware if these practices? 🤔 I doubt it. We all know, as employees, it sucks to be stuck at work past closing. I think if you let people in up to closing they should be allowed an average amount of time to eat. Otherwise, stop letting people pay for a meal past a certain time if you plan on pulling the food right at closing.</review>

I know there are people out there that consider this some kind of great culinary experience but that's because they live in very small worlds and probably think that travel and trying something different means going outside of their block and eating a taco instead of a Big Mac every day.</text>

Hometown Buffett may be closing if what I heard is correct. Unfortunately this one needs to. I used to take all the kids and sit for a couple hours but this particular establishment  has went very downhill in everyway. Sorry, I just have to be honest guys, I don't know what happened but ya'all need to fix it. Pull it together so we can enjoy the restaurant again please!< /review>

<Review>I've always thought Hometown Buffet had decent food, however we went for dinner last week and it was horrible. Food was sub par and options were few. On top of that, the dishes and utensils weren't cleaned properly and our table was sticky. Probably won't be going back.< /Review></record>

This food was not up to my standards. The meats were pink in the middle (steaks, meatloaf and chicken). The black eyed peas were hard and undercooked. The desserts were the bom tho.< /Review>

I'm only giving this 2 stars because the staff was very friendly but the breakfast selection tasted awful for $8.99 a person. The bread was hard, English muffins super rubbery, ham bland and rubbery. Most of the food was cold and tasted stale. First and last time eating breakfast here.<//Text>

<review>This is a typical Hometown Buffet. Call ahead to find out what the menu is for the day. I got there about 10:30 and paid the breakfast price and was told that it would cover the lunch menu also. Can’t beat that.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Basic pñatillos, with a feeling of industrial dining food. The fish had no flavor, the chicken seemed to be overheated. I haven't visited him for years but I think the quality of the experience here is without growth. For example, in Tijuana, the sirloin stockade that they just opened really renewed by offering new dishes. In general, this hometown branch is fine if all you have is hunger and you're not looking to please your family for a weekend.

(Original)
Pñatillos básicos, con una sensación de comida de comedor industrial. El pescado no tenía sabor, el pollo parecia estar recalentado. Hacia años que no lo visitaba pero creo que la calidad de la experiencia aquí se encuentra sin crecimiento. Por ejemplo, en tijuana, el sirloin stockade que acaban de abrir realmente se renovó ofrciendo nuevos platillos. En general esta sucursal de hometown está bien si lo unico que tienes es hambre y no buscas complacer a tu familia un fin de semana.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The worst Buffet I've had. It's bad and ugly in food. The food sometimes comes out cold. The worst was a hair on the cookie and I commented on the reception and they said take it off. They didn't even remove the tray from those cookies there they left them. The bathrooms smell horrible.

Is the worst thing you can try. Is HORRIBLE the food is cold and very bad taste. One time I found a hair in the middle of a cookie I told the manager she told me just take it out. I was so concerned about she told me. She didn't even took the rest of the cookies from that plate. She leave it there. Also, the restroom smell awful. Don't go. I do not recommend it.

(Translated by Google) Excellent place in my opinion for a dinner. While breakfast and lunch are very good, dinner is the best. Also the price is very good and the service is the best, there is constant cleaning and the waitresses are very attentive.
