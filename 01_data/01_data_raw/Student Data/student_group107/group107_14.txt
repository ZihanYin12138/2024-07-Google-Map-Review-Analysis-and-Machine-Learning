<text>Had my best car buying experience ever with Mini of Concord. Easy to agree on a price, F&I was low pressure ( not the usual torture fest), and  easy and quick signing documents and vehicle prep.  Wow, so much better !< /text>< pictures>

Wow! The level of incompetency at this place is hard to describe, let's just say it's astronomical. Although the lovely gentleman who did not help me apologized for my "frustration" he really should have apologized for the dealership's incompetency. I'm sorry you are incapable of running a business. But good luck with everything!<//text>

bought a certified mini (countryman 2018) 2 months ago. Check engine light just went off for the 4th time.  Boy,  I really regret buying this mini!!!!.   been taking it to east bay mini to evaluate.  They are very professional but the repeat issue tells me it is the car and not the dealer.  I reached out to my salesman from concord mini.... crickets.   May be heading to Honda soon.  So depressing< /Text>

<text>Looking for a new car about a year ago, MINI entered the discussion. Watched Doug DeMuro's review of the 2019 Countryman ("Better than you think!") Entranced by the interior aesthetics, started taking test drives around south bay dealerships and was not disappointed. Started chatting with Michael Chavez at Concord MINI and made the drive, totally worth it, he and Sergei were great and I ended up purchasing that day. It's been 9 months and the car is amazing, I smile every time I get in. Driving less during shelter-in-place, so when I do, it's sport mode, every time :)</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808566da2c1e0d1d:0x8c575885a1ea75d6</gmapID></record>

Brought my car in there for service on a Monday and they told me they were closed on Mondays because they don't generate enough service business to open the service center. So I came back on Tuesday and they told me that I needed an appointment because they're too busy since San Francisco Mini closed they are taking in all of their service.  I said fine can I leave my car there and you guys can get to it throughout the week when you can. They said sure we can do that and then they asked if I needed a ride somewhere and they would provide a ride. I asked if they had any loaner vehicles and they said no they are all out right now. I asked him how many loaner vehicles they had and they said about 20.  But apparently they aren't busy enough to be open Mondays. I told them I needed my car looked at because it failed smog and they told me the diagnostics would cost $410. I asked if that could be attributed to the repairs and they said no the diagnostics is a separate cost. I got a call the next day and they tell me that they repairs on my car are going to cost $2,900 plus the diagnostic charge of $410. I decline the repairs and rode my bike over and said I just want to take the car and I'll get a second opinion and they said it won't be ready till this afternoon to be picked up when I was there now at the Mini dealership after having rode my bike 4 miles there to pick it up.  He did say he would go and see if he can get it ready and it was ready to go in only 5 minutes. So that I appreciated!! But I felt like I had to persuade him like I bothered him to ask if it could be made sooner.   I really don't feel well treated here!  I'm from LA and the service center and MINI dealership in Torrance by my house was fantastic compared to this dealership.  They always had a loaner vehicle for me when my car was being serviced and they never told me that the service center is closed due to lack of business. They treated me WELL and always took care of me! Not impressed at all Mini if Concord!!!!!!< /Review>

NOT impressed  at all with this dealership! called dealership for DMTL service which  has a 10yr/120k warranty (which my countrymen fell within). after leaving car at dealership and picking up loaner, received call saying 'based my vin # repairs are not covered'. concord mini refused to hornor mini campaign  warrenty extension..Jacob in service and his 'manager' Rafalle are perfect examples of what's wrong with car dealerships..</Text>

Service Department.
My long-standing mechanic ran the diagnostic on my Mini and told me what was wrong and why an engine light was on. He recommended I go to the dealer for the repair.

I contacted another independent Mini garage for a second opinion. I learned that there was a factory warranty extension on the part that diagnosis #1 showed as failing. (high pressure fuel pump)

With reluctance this second source said go to Mini as it is a warranted repair. I told this garage that my first choice mechanic had reset the 'lights'. She told me that the computer in my car still retained the 'event' and that it would be found.

I went to Mini of Concord. I had to wait a week for am appointment that provided me with a loaner car. There are no repairs while you wait, even if it is only the $205 diagnosis. In on Thursday with the promise of an answer the following Tuesday. You read that right.

Mid afternoon the following Tuesday I received a call from the service rep that my car needed new plugs and the fuel injectors cleaned. $600. No mention of the high pressure fuel pump that was originally ferreted out by one source and confirmed to be problematic and warranty work by the second source.

I asked if the technician looked at the print-out I had brought indicating the problem was a fuel pump and was told the plugs and the injector cleaning were all that was needed.

The plugs were less than three months old. Factory equipment. Installed elsewhere when I had the car in for a scheduled service.

The service rep minimized the fuel injector clean out, likening it to a can of over the counter clean-out product and that the entire service wouldn't take that much longer. $600 and not the real problem.

Mini of Concord did not want to dedicate the time on their analysis equipment to 'reach deeper' into my car's computer. They are inundated with business since the closing of a nearby Mini dealership. They are ill-prepared with an overworked staff and wonderfully, overbooked for tons of future work.

The problem I wanted repaired remains unaddressed and according to  Mini of Concord they have no way of confirming the problem is real despite the independent print out I provided and ignoring the question as to their full, in-depth analysis capabilities.

I hope when this problem resurfaces and the engine goes to half-power as it is programmed to do, my family and I are not placed in peril. I no longer trust Mini of Concord<//review>

Buying a car is stressful and takes long hours as everyone knows, but with Michael's professionalism, friendliness, responsiveness, and attentiveness, I had a wonderful experience. He has been working there for more than 15 years. He is so knowledgeable, and he can answer any questions. I could tell his passion about Mini Cooper and he owns one too. He is genuinely a caring person with wonderful sense of humor which helps for having a good experience.
Thanks so much Michael for helping me and making one of my longing dreams come true. I finally got my MINI Cooper Convertible Sport Package!
I LOVE MY CAR! I ENJOY DRIVING AND CURSING IT! WHAT A FANTASTIC CAR WITH GREAT PERFORMANCE.......

We negotiated a price over text over a few days time. Got right to the point on the price. Once we agreed upon a price, we completed the credit app online and spent a total of 20 minutes in the dealership to complete the purchase. The drive to Concord took 6x longer than the actual time we spent at the dealership. Real happy with the price we paid and the ease of the purchase.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808566da2c1e0d1d:0x8c575885a1ea75d6<//GmapID></record>

Way overpriced. Wanted to charge me $500 to replace the timing chain tensioner because it was leaking oil. The reason it was leaking oil is because it was loose. I didn't approve the repair and did it myself. It took under 30 minutes with a Leatherman and a 27MM wrench. Retail list price for the part is $72.58 and if memory serves, the line item for the part on the quote was nearly double that. This is why dealership service shops have the reputation they have. The reason for 2 stars instead of one was because customer service was good.<//Review>

After the sale was complete he took care of things that add the extra personal touch like placing a large red bow on my new cute little mini, than took several pics of me and my new addition. Everyone in the store was super friendly. There like one big happy family. Thanks Butch and the rest if the mini family!<//Review>< pics>

First arrived at Mini of Concord and was looking around. Butch was the first person that came out and greeted us. He gave us space to look around and told us to let him know if we had any questions. After a couple minutes we ended up doing a test drive and just speaking to Butch we already knew he was the right guy to purchase from made everything extremely pleasant and easy. Ended up purchasing the car and couldn't have had a better experience.<//text>

<text>Literally just left here. Walked around the lot and no rep acknowledge or said hello. Knew the type of car I wanted from online. I walked in and with over a dozen employees and nothing. Not a friendly atmosphere. Highly unprofessional. I do not recommend taking your business here. I will go down the street. Experience and first impression is important. Don’t waste your time here.< /text></record>

<text>I went into Mini Cooper of Concord about a month ago and had the best car experience a girl could ask for. Sergei Beloi (sales manager) was so welcoming! It was a very busy day there at Mini, Sergei made sure I was taken care of and put me in very good hands. Mark Wilson made sure I walked out of that dealership with the perfect mini. He made sure I test drove all the models I was interested in and I felt no pressure or was I rushed at all. If you're reading this Mark you get an A+! (I'm also a teacher) Thank you so much Mini of Concord so happy I chose to make the drive to Concord instead of going to Mini of Mountain View.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Marcel Morlino is outstanding!!
I have a 2015 Mini Hardtop. I took it on Feb 6, 2017 for its 2-year maintenance, and I had superb customer service!
Marcel helped me right away, and he was just great, very courteous and efficient, reviewed all my information quickly, listened to all I had to say, and took great care of my baby!
He was also the service advisor who helped me last year, and he was just as nice then!
I was given a loaner Mini while my car was being serviced, which was a great opportunity to test the new model. I had my car back that afternoon, free of charge. My Mini is set until next year!
Thanks Mini of Concord, you guys are like family :D</review>

Helped by holding used car for 3 weeks at no charge to allow a true birthday surprise. Also allowed the use of new car financing on very lightly used (exec demo) car.

Always seemed to have my interest in mind. Go and ask for Michael (Chavez).< /text>

We had a not so great experience with another Mini dealership, who shall not be named, and went to Mini of Concord with some reservations.  However, from the moment I contacted them, before they even opened, Jason had won me over with his responsiveness and friendliness.  The used vehicle I wanted wasn't even on the lot when I called (it was still being cleaned), but Jason ensured that by the time my husband and I made the hour drive to Concord, it was at a stage where we could test drive it.  Jason made the negotiation part a breeze (really because they have things priced so well!) and Alyce made all of the "fun" financing process literally fun.  Our little Mini had to go back for some additional work the next day, so we dealt with Shane, who was a pleasure to work with as well.  They even drove to Tracy, dropped off a loaner and brought the car back when it was ready.  Such service!!  Thank you, team!!</review>< Rating>

Never get your car serviced here--they wanted to charge me $180 for something an independent shop did in 5 minutes for free (they said it was too easy, they didn't feel right charging me for it.) The work was programming a new key for a Mini.

Avoid getting scammed and overcharged, take your car to an independent shop, even for new key programming.< /text>

Best car shopping experience. Jason Krupa was solid and professional. He helped me to locate the car, offered the most competitive price among all of  other dealerships on my list without any drama, and got me pre-approved on desired financial terms without needing to bother me on the phone a single time. He replied my email questions with simple, solid answers so I did not waste any time. My actual time spent at the dealership was less than 30 min. Highly recommended if you are looking for a new or used Mini in the Bay Area !<//Review>

We had a wonderful experience at MINI of Concord thanks to Butch Madayag. Butch was incredibly friendly, helpful and relaxed. He let us guide ourselves toward the car we wanted, and once we found it, he worked with us to shape the deal that worked best for us. We've been around shady car dealers in the past. And Butch was a welcome antidote to all of those bad memories. I cannot more highly recommend a dealer.< /text>

I just got my new special ordered mini copper S there and I am very happy with the services and price I got. Jason is absolutely great!!
I lived in mountain View, so Concord is more than an hour drive for me, but I still think it is way worth it to buy from there. I had looked for mini from couple other dealers closer to my area, they all gave me a lot of pressure in buying. Then I found Jason, communicated with him through phone and emails, he gave me good advice, offered me a price much better than the other mini dealers offered me and the purchasing process was smooth with no problem.
When I picked up my car,  Jason is very knowledgable, he told me all the details about the car.
And he even followup few days after I picked up the car and see how I was doing with it.
Best experience I ever had with a car sales. I will definitely come back in the future.</text>< pics>

I'm an Oregonian & asked a couple questions about purchasing from out-of-state via email.  He responded immediately and said even though they sold the specific car I'd emailed about, they would honor the same price on a similar vehicle.  I ended up not buying a car--any car--this spring but these guys will be the first email I send in the fall when I'm fully ready.</Text>< Pics>

Decided to buy a car one day, went online and found a couple in the bay area that I liked, emailed Jason Krupa at MINI of Concord, he replied like at midnight on a Sunday. On Monday, his day off he was emailing and calling and handing us off to another colleague Butch Madayag. Gave us a great deal. Together they provided exceptional and speedy customer service. We drove home with a mini that afternoon less than 24 hours after I decided I wanted to buy a car.< /text>

I purchased Mini Countryman from Jason Krupa. He was honest, respectful and I felt zero pressure to rush my decision. Jason was very responsive to my many emails and phone calls. We had most of the deal mapped out before I even set foot in the dealership. Once I sat down with him face-to-face our arrangement did not change except to further accommodate my needs. Not once did he leave me in the office to sweat me out or "forget" what we had discussed. It was the least combative car buying experience I've ever had and I've had a few! I think I was only there about an hour before I was zipping off in my new cutie. I am a hairstylist and when I was speaking to my client (another Mini owner) about my car, she launched into a glowing review of her salesperson. Guess who it was?<//text>

I do not trust car salesmen. That said, there is one exception, Michael Chavez. This guy is straight up honest, helpful, knows his stuff, and is all about making a fair deal and having a happy costumer! I have bought TWO MINIs from Michael and would buy a third when the time comes. He's a good an honest man who believes in the product he is selling. No high pressure, no game playing with managers, he respects customers who come in prepared and knowledgeable--I cannot recommend him highly enough! MICHAEL CHAVEZ ROCKS!! Go see him and see!<//text>

Scott Sills, Service Manager of Mini Cooper, Concord, California is one of the best, most honest, most capable Service Mgr I ever encountered! After  MY daughter's car was serviced I noticed a chrome molding was missing from the car hood, so I returned it and brought it to their attention. He took care of it fair and square! I HIGHLY RECOMMNED HIM and Mini Cooper Service Dept in Concord, CA for a job well done everytime!</Review>

I was a Mazda owner and got my first Mini in April (from another branch). I have came to this Concord branch twice already since my work is close to here, but both times didn't end up getting anything done. The people here lack motivation to work; really bad customer service, basically none because both times I was directed somewhere else or they can't get me a loaner till 10 days later.
Updated: So I went home and check online to see when a loaner is available, they actually have it available 4 days later but the person who help me told me 10 days later. To me, he clearly didn't want to work.< /Text>

Michael Chavez hooked up us with a trade in our newer car and even gave us a loaner overnight!  We weren't expecting to even buy a car that night, but Michael and his boss Mr Sergei Beloi (sales manager) had us ready to go and out the door the next day!</review>

My husband and I had been looking for a mini for me to replace my miata that got totaled for about 1 month. After a bad buy with a private party, we decided to go dealership route. My husband went to the SF dealership and they has what we wanted (older year Mini Cooper, hardtop S with low miles) but it wasn't on the lot yet. So we visited the Concord one. When we arrived on the lot someone immediately noticed us looking around and asked if we needed help, we did so they sent out a sales person. In comes Michael Chaves. We asked if they had anything like we were looking for. Turns out they had a lease return with less than 20,000 miles in great condition. But we weren't looking for something that new. (the one in SF was a 2002). We opted to check it out anyways. Michael was VERY knowledgeable about the cars. My husband (who drives and works on race cars) knew exactly what he wanted for me and Michael had answers. He even knew how much the car weighed when I asked, no hesitation. (I like light little cars, hence the miata before).  Michael did not pressure us, the car we were looking at was slated to be a CPO but hadn't been completed yet so it wasn't amazing looking. He explained what they do, what a CPO is, etc. We left without feeling like we were violated and tasked to think about it.

We discussed and my husband agreed I could get what I wanted, either the 2002 or the 2012. I hemmed and hawed up until the day we were scheduled to go in and buy. I felt if I didn't get the newer one, I would regret it. So I went with the 2012. Michael was ready for us, and so was the car (my baby car 2.0) when we arrived on Friday night. We test drove it (not necessary but fun) and then settled to agree on the terms. I had a concern that there was damage to the front bumper that hadn't been repaired. For my husband, this was a bargaining tool. In the end, we paid a price we were comfortable with AND they agreed to repair the bumper. Jason, who assisted with the sale was nice as well.

When they went to do the contract, there were others ahead of us and the wait was about an hour. We were able to leave and get dinner and come back when they were ready for us. I cannot remember the women who helped us with the contract but she was good also. After that was done, Michael gave me my keys (complete with Mini key chain!) and spent time showing me the features of the car. I really appreciated this since I am not use to a European car and some things were different, it helped a lot.

I read all the reviews on this dealer before going but I was set on this car and in the end, Michael was GREAT. The process was so smooth and he really made it easy without pressuring us. I would highly recommend this dealer and Michael if you are EVER looking for a Mini. I love my Mini Cooper!<//review>

<Review>This was my first time buying a car, and Butch changed all my preconceptions of the 'slick' care salesman.

From the initial online inquiry into a pre-owned Mini, Butch was very transparent in what was available - providing detailed specs of all the pre-owned Minis. This was important to me as other salesmen who were closer to San Francisco played coy and gave vague details, all in hopes of getting someone into the dealership.

Once my girlfriend & I arrived at the dealership, Butch was very attentive as to what we were looking for - and didn't steer us to the more expensive option (as an aside, Mini Concord a great selection of pre-owned Countrymen in the B.A.).

In the end, we had a choice of two pre-owned cars with the options we were looking for. Throughout the process, Butch was helpful - he encouraged us to really test-drive both models and helped us get the best deal & financing.  And after the sale, he followed up with phone calls to see if we had any questions or issues with our purchase.

I would highly recommend Butch to anyone looking for a Mini - new or pre-owned.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>This was the best experience with any of the service providers during our move. Jon is absolutely amazing. Story below:

So I had been bailed on by another company literally the day of my move. I was absolutely freaking out. I had to be out with the carpets cleaned by the end of the day. I called a couple of companies who quoted me ridiculous prices because they knew I was in a bind. Called Jon, he was so nice and squeezed me in at a fair price. Super nice guy! He was efficient but also did an absolutely incredible job. Our beige carpet was black from the amount of foot traffic it had seen. Jon made it look like new. He was also so pleasant and communicative to work with explained drying times to me and the different methods of cleaning so we could plan to have our cleaners come. Can’t thank John enough. Thanks to him getting the carpets cleaned was the easiest part of my move!</text>< pictures>

I had a great experience with Jon today. He arrived on time, did a solid job of cleaning several years of pet stains from our carpet and tile, and gave me advice about whether/how to pull our baseboards in one particularly problematic area. I really appreciate people who take the time to talk through what they're doing and why, and Jon excelled at that part of the job.< /Review>

Jon is awesome and his services were magnificent.  He did an outstanding job on our carpet, it looks brand new, so he deserves 10 stars.  We plan to definitely use his company for future carpet and furniture care needs.<//text>

Great job! My dog threw up on my new carpet. I usually use Stanley Steamer but they couldn’t come out right away. I called Jon and he was here in an hour.  He removed the very dark stain that I had made worse by trying to remove it myself.  He was very personable and professional. There was no extra charge for deodorizer and  my carpet looks brand new again!<//Review>

Within hours of my request, Jon picked up both of my carpets. They came back with absolutely no stains (pet and wine). He charges very reasonably and offers the best customer service I've experienced in 30 years. I would highly recommend J&S services.</text>

<review>So happy that our original Google choice didn't pan out and ended up calling JON AND SONS!! The first place we booked came to our home and tried to up charge us by 300%. WOW. Don't get fooled with "special" deals or feel pressured into saying yes to such a drastic change in cost because they are already there. Save yourself the stress and headache by calling these guys! Not only did a fantastic job making our carpets look brand new but such lovely people as well. So happy to find my go to carpet and upholstery cleaners! Thanks again JON AND SONS! :)</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The very best carpet cleaning job we have EVER experienced in the last 30 years.
The carpet is 20 years old and had spots we thought would never come clean and we have had spots, that we were told in the past by other cleaners, there was nothing could be done to remove  those spots.
WRONG, JON  the owner performed magic and made our beige carpet look 95 per cent like new.
Great service,Great price,
Will certainly use this service again and also highly recommend this service to all.< /review>

< Review>
I myself run a handyman business with my son and was so happy that my wife found Jon & Sons. Jon was not only puntual & totally professional, he presented himself well, communicated well and was obviously a kind individual. We were impressed with his focus on protecting our home from risks of his equipment and insuring that we were comfortable with how he operated. He spent a lot of time cleaning our carpets and area rug and they looked and smelled amazing when he was done! We have had other cleaning services through the years but will only call Jon & sons in the future and know that anyone who calls them will feel the same. Thanks again Jon for the fantastic job!<//Review>

<Review>WOW, I rarely give this kind of review to ANY company or business. I have high expectations when it comes to all of the above mentioned qualities. But John thoroughly exceeded the value that he brings to the table. I cannot say enough about my satisfaction with his workmanship and quality. He used  CRB (counter rotating brush machine. I have used many steam cleaners in the past and have NEVER seen anyone use it on any job I’ve ever had done. Give this local business owner a call...I guarantee it will be worth your investment.

This was our second time using a carpet cleaning and they did a fantastic job and took their time. I definitely recommend Jons and Sons to everyone. Jon was very accommodating and even gave us a discount! Couldn’t have asked for better!< /review>< Pictures>

<username>Jewel Taison< /username><Date>1583441769886<//Date><text>My husband and I have been wanting to get our carpet cleaned professionally. So my sister in law had recommended Jon b/c he also works on her carpet & we’ve seen his work. Let me just say AMAZING! And our home is literally all carpet and we have two toddlers as well as a german shepherd who has been shedding a whole lot..So over these past months our carpets have built up with stains and so much dog fur...it’s crazy. & yet here I was trying to take an easy route by renting a carpet cleaner from Walmart to get the job done. Well Thank God I didn’t b/c I probably still wouldn’t have been satisfied. I’m just so happy and relieved that we chose Jon and Sons to get the job done. It feels so great to come home to such perfect clean carpet. He even asked us about certain stains or what they were so that way he knows what’s the best treatment to use to take out the stain. Also very punctual & responsive. We really enjoyed his company & working with him. Highly recommend him and I myself most definitely will refer him to family and friends. HE IS PHENOMENAL!  Huge thanks again Jon and Sons, we greatly appreciate your service and can’t wait for you to work your magic again this coming up July.</text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Omg such great results! I honestly thought I'd have to replace my carpets and this would be a waste of time and money. 2 kids and 4 pets it was my last chance at saving my carpets! I will definitely be using Jon and Sons Carpet Cleaners for all my carpet cleaning needs! Jon was so professional, respectful and easy to talk to. Jon provided amazing results and super friendly service.
Will definitely be referring him to my friends and family!
Thank you Jon and Sons!< /text>

<text>A friend referred me to Jon and sons and Jon did not disappoint. I'm a mother of 2 with one on the way and I really needed my carpets cleaned. Jon was very friendly and took the time to explain to me his cleaning process when I called to schedule a cleaning appointment. He also shared with me how to handle spills to keep them from staining in the future. I have a beige color carpet so keeping it clean with small children is a challenge. About half way thru the cleaning Jon stopped to show me the clean vs dirty carpet and I couldn't believe it. The difference was really surprising. I'm still very happy with how everything turned out and already schedule my next cleaning in 6 months. I highly recommend using Jon and sons!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I found my new carpet cleaning guy! Jon was easy to schedule an appointment with and arrived right on time.  When he arrived we did a quick tour of my house and he walked me thru his cleaning process. I was caught off guard to see a carpet cleaner take the time to use floor runners to protect my tile entry.  He also used some corner protection thingys so his hoses wouldn't chip any paint on my walls. Carpet cleaners I've used in the past have always just left my front door wide open while cleaning but, Jon used some kind of plastic door cover that allowed his hoses to come through while still maintaining privacy to my home and not allowing flies to come in.  In the end my carpets could not have looked any better.  In a house that constantly has kids running a muck I am very pleased with his work. I highly recommend Jon and sons carpet cleaners.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have 2 dogs and a toddler, so my carpets require cleanings pretty often. I have been using my own Bissell carpet cleaner for years, but the problem stains in my carpet kept coming back up. I finally caved and decided to go with a professional. Jon and Sons Carpet cleaning was recommended to me by a friend and based on her review I decided to schedule an appointment. Let me tell you, I am so glad I called! After he completed my cleaning, my carpet was a whole shade lighter! I didn’t realize how dirty my carpet was, which is a bit frustrating since we vacuum daily and I was using my “professional Bissell cleaner” every six months! Jons products are kid and pet friendly and there was zero cleaning/chemical odor when he was finished. I appreciated his high level of professionalism and his attention to detail. Jon cleaned my carpets back in November 2018 and my problem stains have not returned!<//Text>

This place always gets my order wrong. Would use the app to be specific, "add whip" yet they always forget. When I ask for it, they would lift the flat lid, put a small amount and then close the lid, overflowing the coffee and hand it back. Today, I asked the barista not to do put the same lid on and she had the nerve to ask me, "what lid did you want then?" The one you normally use when you add whip cream! Super rude. There are tons of coffee shops around. Don't waste your time and energy here supporting rude baristas.</review>

<Review>the coffee was fine - the same as it is everywhere.  But the chairs are high and metal, which in San Francisco in October is seriously cold on your butt.  They do not have the welcoming, inviting atmosphere of other coffee shops I enjoy.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, but not nearly as comfortable as I expect.< /Review>< user_id>

Bad service, I made the mistake of telecommuting here for a few days. I witnessed the manager bad mouthing customers and employees within earshot. Then he went on a full blown sob story about how hard his life is serving coffee lol. Pretty pathetic. Other than that the place is decent location.<//text>

Ordered large hot chocolate and the cup was not full, it was only filled to about an inch and a half from the top and it was not hot at all. I get hot chocolate all the time from Starbucks and usually its filled pretty much to the rim and hot enough to switch hands several times before reaching my location, not here though...</Text>

<Review>I celebrated my birthday today in this gorgeous place. I am glad to say that we had a phenomenal evening and the venue was undoubtedly one of the reasons for this fruitful evening. The stuff  collaborated in a gorgeous way, the meals were very good and my friends were extremely  thrilled. We shall definitely come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Awesome place 5 stars! Family owned and not your regular taqueria. The tortilla soup is on point. Good people and great food all around. A little hard to find their menu so I will share one. Thanks for the good service LaBonita! Better menu at their website.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>My wife and I have been to all of the Mexican restaurants from Placerville down to Mather Field. Out of all of these this one is the best hands down!!! The food is cooked by a husband and wife team, who not only cook with the best of ingredients, but also add that one extra ingredient that most are missing these days Amore(love). That you CAN taste in every bite.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809add3be2734795:0x50799069b3f351d6<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Good place to eat around Mather area. The owner is so cool. I had the street tacos and they were sooo good. I had asada, pastor and chorizo. The meat is crispy yet juicy. Definitely coming back.< /Text>< pics>

I had the regular tacos, and was not disappointed! The carnitas was excellent, the salsas amazing, and the tacos were larger than I'd expected for the price. Will absolutely get these again!<//text>

I thought this place was really good for lunch.  I ordered a taco salad. It was basic but worth the price.  Unlimited chips and salsa.  The way they have it made you have to reach over for salsa and chips to get the containers which doesnt seem right. Other than that the staff are waiting on you hand and feet which is great.  Food comes out fast too<//text>

The moment I walked in I thought to myself "oh WOW it's super clean in here, Nice!" The gentleman behind the counter took my order quickly and we had a nice chat. My super asada burrito came out promptly and on my first bite I was blown away by the great flavor!!  Not only did they get my requests of no lettuce or sour cream rite, but this is the best burrito I've had in a long time!!  I only wished I lived nearby so I could become a regular!!<//Text>

After seeing a great review on Nextdoor about this place, we decided to give it a shot. We will be returning with the rest of the family next week for taco Tuesday. We enjoyed a mixed taco plate, fish and chips, and a great selection of salsas. Afterwards, we were treated to fruit and cream filled churros which were amazing!  You should give this friendly taqueria a try the next time you're out and about. We are glad we did.<//text>

<Text>The food had good flavor and the portions were pretty fair sized. The people who worked their were friendly and made sure I was taken care of. Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is the price was a tad bit high for the items that they had on the menu. $12 and change for a taco, rice and beans.</Text><time>1556924012325</time><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

<review>I have eaten at many mexican restaurants and this one is my favorite. Their carnitas are cooked to perfection, never greasy or fatty. The owner told me they are made differently than most recipes. They are reasonably priced, have super fast service and great food. You won't be disappointed!</review>< name>

<text>Not from the area and saw that this was rated top 10 on yelp for the area, and decided to try the place. Staff was helpful and worked quick to help serve everyone as quickly as possible. I had their burrito and it seemed like every other Hispanic restaurant I’ve been too. Nothing too wow worthy about the meal. Menu seems reasonably priced for the area.</text><gmapID>0x809add3be2734795:0x50799069b3f351d6< /gmapID>< response>

Place just recently opened and it's crazy delicious. Came in on a slow day and spent some time chatting with one of the owners (Hugo, I believe his name was). Spectacular customer service, super cool guy, and a menu that definitely makes me want to come back.

On your first visit I highly recommend their enchiladas-you won't be disappointed< /review>

<Text>Food is great when they get the order right which is maybe once in a month. The food is covered in salt to make up for the crappy taste and quality. They have charged for things that weren't in my order or my bag when I left the store. They will try to over charge you and cheat you out of your food and your money. They never update their software so if you use a card don't go here it's not going to accept your card. I had 7.40 on my card the entire order was 6.74 and it didn't go through and they refuse to update the system and fix this. Very angry and so done.
I've been eating at the place since it opened and it's been nothing but a disappointment after disappointment. Finding another place for my carnitas.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I had a super chicken burrito 🌯 and it was very tastey. They also have a nice chips and salsa bar with many salsas to choose from.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.</Text>

Went there around 530pm on a Sunday. My group were the only people eating at the time. Eventually it picked up and others trickled in. The food was so so. My quesadilla was not very good; however my friend ordered it after I finished mine and it was better.</Text>

No beer no tamales...plenty of salt though.  Was a favorite local joint for tacos but guac is not made with avocados.  A shame this place ended up to be a let down.  😢< /Review>

West Coast Funding provided an amazing Loan Officer, Cody Coleman. I was informed about the process during my journey to purchasing my first home. Cody was professional and extremely responsive with any concerns I had, he even went beyond to recommend best options. When it comes to buying a home in general there is enough stress, and I was blessed to have a great loan offer seeing my best interest. I strongly recommend not only using West Coast Funding, as well as reaching out to Cody to make your purchase journey effective and efficient.</Text>

Jeremiah Andujo is the man. He got me a great deal on the refinance and helped me understand the process. Most importantly he was available to answer any and all questions pertaining to the refinance and the market. He communicates on all platforms and checks up on his clients routinely throughout the process. I appreciate Jeremiah and West Coast Funding and would recommend them to anyone interested in refinancing.<//Review>

Recently refinanced my condo to take advantage of today's low rates. Jeremiah Andujo handled everything from start to finish. The entire process could not have been easier. Jeremiah was on top of every detail from the beginning and was always available. It was easy to see where wcf247 came from. Whether it was day, night, or weekend, Jeremiah always responded promptly. All paperwork was easily submitted through their website. A last minute change on my part was quickly handled. I came away feeling that the whole thing had been done with a trusted friend.< /review>

I worked with Steven on my (first ever) home loan. He was absolutely fantastic to work with! Considering I knew nothing about home loans he walked me through every step of the process, was very knowledgeable, and responsive. He was also able to give me the best interest rate (I got 6 quotes)!

I would 100% recommend my friends or family to work with Steven on their future home loans.<//review>

West Coast Funding was a pleasure to do business with. They are knowledgeable, professional, efficient, courteous, and extremely personable. They walked us through our re-fi effortlessly. Working with our agent, Andre was like a dream come true. I recommend anyone looking for a lender with professionalism and ease, call Andre at West Coast Funding. You will be pleased as we are.< /text>

West Coast Funding is a great company to get Mortgage help. Macklin, Shane, and Kaylah are a fantastic team. They were all so professional and helpful throughout my home Refi process. I can't thank them enough for the help they were able to give us with our home mortgage. They were able to get us the best mortgage rate we have ever had. I love the support they give all their clients. I have already started referring them to everybody I know who is thinking about refinancing. Right now is the best time to call them if you are even slightly considering changing your mortgage company.</text>

We have recently completed a refinance through West Coast Funding taking only 14 days from our first contact with Casey Peek to signing the final documents with the notary.  We have refinanced many times over the years, and as I told Casey, this time was by far the easiest, most stress- free we've ever done.  We would not hesitate to recommend West Coast Funding and in particular, Casey, who was always quick to respond to my texts and phone calls, answering any questions or concerns I had.  We are very pleased with our new loan as we got a great rate!</text>

Shane and Kaylah were great to work with. They were very professional and communicative throughout my refinancing experience. I was in the process of a IRRRL with a different lender who I thought were being straightforward, boy was I wrong. Shane and his crew saved me 15K! I’m glad I was referred to him before I closed. It gives me pleasure knowing there are businesses looking out for veterans!</review>

<rate>5</rate><review>My husband and I bought our first home together in March with the help of Shane and Kaylah at West Coast Funding! Both of them were extremely helpful, especially when we were gathering all required documents. They were also very patient with me as I had a million questions about everything.

In November, Shane actually reached out to me regarding a refinance that will lower down our monthly payment and APR.  With literally almost no work on my end, we closed our refinance in December at 2.25%! I was so glad Shane reached out to me since I was actually receiving multiple letters regarding refinance. Aside from lower APR and lower monthly mortgage payment, we also skipped 1 month of pay (which was so nice during the holidays)!

I cannot stress enough how happy we were to have worked with Shane and Kaylah! Looking forward to working with them in the future, whether it be another refinance or to purchase another home!

My husband and I definitely recommend West Coast Funding!< /review>< Pics>

I cannot thank Shane, Kaylah, and the rest of the West Coast Funding team enough for the outstanding job they did helping me buy my first home. True professionals. They were respectful and patience with my wife and I and they were always available to to ease our concerns and explained things in a manner that even I could understand. I had an extremely pleasurable and incredibly smooth experience buying our home. I would recommend West Coast Funding to anyone and do not know why someone would go elsewhere. They are the best! Thank You!</text>

<Text>You will be in good hands if you work with Steven from West Coast Funding!  We are first time homeowners and were very apprehensive about the whole process.  You will have more confidence with Steven on your side.  He was readily available, even late at night, to answer questions.  We never felt pressured or looked down upon when we were unsure or needed to understand the financial obligations towards owning a home.  If you are really serious about buying a home, they will make the process simple and easy.  And most importantly they are very attentive and efficient when you want to close fast on your home.  Very happy with our experience with them :)</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

We have been using West Coast Funding for the past 5 years and have never been disappointed.   They are extremely personable and very professional.  They made me feel like I was the only account they were working on.  From the top down, everyone cares about me  I could not ask for a better company to work with.  I highly recommend that you stop looking and just CALL TROY.  You will not be disappointed.</text>

This is a late review.  I looked into VA IRRRL rates around summer of 2020 and was referred to Troy and his team.  I began the VA Refi back in July of 2020 and completed the process in September 2020.  Troy and his team worked diligently to get the paperwork processed and we encountered delays due to things happening beyond our control.  Troy and his team took care of me and I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking to refinance their VA loans.  Prompt, professional and advised me every step of the way.<//Text>

We have worked with West Coast Funding numerous times and they are literally the only company we will use. The team( Especially Tom!)  has always been quick to respond and answer any questions. They are sincere and ethical and have been a pleasure to work with. They get it done and work for you! We have a VA loan and they have proven time and time again to be knowledgeable and professional in all interactions. If you’re in the market for a new loan, a Refinance or anything else mortgage related you will not be disappointed!</review>

A complete Re-Fi in 20 days is phenomenal and unheard of. We were referred to Casey Peek with rave reviews by our friends and feel grateful we heard about him.
Very impressed with his responsiveness and his ability to explain the details.
We have re-fi'd 3 times in 20 years and never experienced such an affordable price.
Impressive all around!!!</Text>

Consummate professionals, Shane and Kaylah made the answer yes at each and every juncture applying their vast knowledge of the mortgage industry to make what had promised to be a complicated refi a transparent, drama-free transaction.  Beyond the technical aspects of the process, however, is their empathy, kindness and judgement free orientation - WCF can bring home the bacon and do it with heart!  Run don’t walk to WCF for your next mortgage transaction - you will be glad that you did!!<//text>

<review>Shout out to Steven T. & Brian for taking care of us through the whole process. From checking our credit report to closing in our house, they kept it very professional, answered all our questions, stayed active communicating everything and keeping us posted. Couldn’t have asked for anyone better.

This being our first time buying a home, it was quite a fun experience!

My advice to first time buyers, it is a very competitive market here in California, so look very carefully in a timely manner. Focus more on your dislikes than your likes when looking for your future home.< /review>< resp>

Troy and his associates were very helpful in my quest to lower my mortgage rate. They made it a very simple and easy process. They kept my wife and I updated throughout the process and always picked up the phone when I had a question I needed answered. West Coast Funding is the only company I will use for my mortgage needs in the future. Very Very satisfied with my experience. Thanks again West Coast Funding, look forward to doing more business with you in the future.<//Review>

Got to work with Steven and what can I say the man is a wizard and tracks alot more than what's just in his lane he is a very professional and efficient. I am very happy my wife and I were able to get the deal we did and the rates are very affordable thanks to Stevens magic. I would highly recommend Steven if you are considering jumping into the home buying arena. As a Army Veteran it was very reassuring knowing he understood us and had our best interest at heart. I know in the future we will not even look at anyone else to help us find another home Steven and West Coast Funding are the only way to go! Highly recommend!< /Review>

We have  worked with Troy Moritz and West Coast funding for more than 7 years now. We have purchased two homes and refinanced both loans with West Coast Funding and have had an incredible experience every time. The level of customer service with every one we have dealt with has been incredible. Our loans are often complicated due to my husband being self employed and the team at West Coast Funding always works with us to find us the best rates and the best loans even though it would be easier to just give us whatever they could find. You will get nothing but outstanding customer service and personal attention with West Coast Funding, and I recommend them to family and friends with full confidence all the time.</Text>

Troy Moritz and his team were  professional, friendly and patient,  they were very good at keeping  us informed of the loan process.  We lived in Northern California and bought in San Diego.  Paperwork went flawless and very secure with our financial information.  I would not hesitate to hire his team again  to finance a house  or refi.  Thank you Troy and your great team!    🏚< /Review>

I am very please on the speed of service and the streamline on closing the escrow. Highly recommended 👍🙌👍< /review>

“Was referred to Troy and West Coast Funding through a mutual friend.  Having refinanced many times with the same mortgage broker for the past 20 years, this was a new experience.  Very impressed with the whole process.  Both Troy and Stephanie are very responsive and very professional.  Everything went so smooth and we are happy with the entire experience.  We will definitely call Troy for our future needs as well.  Thanks guys!”

If you are looking for someone to not just help you with buying your home at a good rate but to help you enjoy your experience then look no further than Steven. Steven always made sure we understood everything that was going on, and if there was a way to make sure we got a better deal, then he was immediately on top of it. Furthermore, there were several times throughout the purchase of our new home were I had questions regarding numbers or policies that I just didn’t understand. I would just text or call Steven at ANY point/time throughout the day and he would ALWAYS answer and give me the appropriate response or answer. Rest assured, if we ever make another purchase I’ll ensure we contact Steven, he has my business from here on out.</Text>

Look no further with West Coast Funding!
We had the pleasure of working with Shane, Kaylah, and Rosie. Rest assured you’ll be in great hands! Their team is all very knowledgeable and prompt with any questions we had. My husband and I recently went through purchasing my parents’ house from them. We had some obstacles along the way due to COVID 19. Our situation of acquiring my parents house without paying for a real estate agent, and with one of my parents already out the country was a challenging, yet a successful accomplishment using the team at WCF. Not only were they easily accessible and transparent, but they walked us through the intricacies in getting the appropriate paperwork completed under a tight deadline. They gave us the best rate out of our list of referrals and yelp choices, and found an international notary based in the US that would notarize documents via webcam due to one of my parents stuck in a country with a closed US embassy. Shane and his team worked together seamlessly on both the buyer and seller side to get it done and Rosie went out of her way commuting to us to get documents signed for both parties! We can’t thank the team enough for all their hard work. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//review>

As a real estate agent, I work with different lenders all the time. I have seen first hand how a lender can make or break a transaction. Troy, with West Coast Funding, is by far the best lender I have ever worked with both on the sellers side and buyers side of the transaction. He cares about each client and their best interest and consistently puts clients needs first.
I recommend Troy and West Coast Funding to my family, friends and all of my clients!</review>

My husband and I had an incredible experience working with Joe Burns at West Coast Funding to get a mortgage for our new home. We were on a super tight timeline, and Joe worked with us around the clock to get a pre-approval within 48 hours, and then we closed within three weeks.

When we decided to refinance this year, we went back to Joe and had a seamless, easy experience. Highly recommend!</text>

Casey is the best out there! He first met with my wife and me to go over all the possible options and recommended what he thought was best for us. After my wife and I decided on an option, Casey kept in constant communication educating us on what to expect and what is best for us after hearing our needs.
I had some questions naturally when docs were being composed, and he took the time to walk me through the documents and answer all my questions no matter how trivial. I would definitely recommend Casey to anyone and going forward will only work with Casey and WCF. It also helps that he's a good golfer...< /Text>

<review>Being connected with Shane and West Coast Funding was nothing short of a blessing. I was working with another lender who put an unreasonable cap on how much I could borrow and I would have never closed on my beautiful home without Shane’s help. He took me seriously as a borrower and was there every step of the way, alongside my realtor, helping me close on a home as quick as possible. He had the knowledge and patience necessary to answer all of my questions as a first time buyer, and helped to make the entire process smooth. Even after being in my home for a couple months, he still reaches out to ensure everything is well and keeps me informed on additional financial opportunities to take advantage of.  I highly recommend his services.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Over the years I have refinanced my home several times using the services of West Coast funding. Steven has been very professional, very diligent and understanding. There are some things that come up that always make my loan a challenge .  I receive so many offers to refinance my home in the mail and I would not use the services of any one else.   It’s  been a joy working with Stephen and all the people at West Coast funding.   I can count on Steven to let me know when rates have gone down enough that it’s beneficial for me to refinance.  I appreciate the team at West Coast.<//Review>

<review>I couldn’t be more pleased with Troy and Stephanie’s work with my refinancing.  They accomplished everything I had hoped for; significant reduction in the monthly payment, a couple monthly payments I can use elsewhere, no out of pocket expenses at closing and paying off this supplemental tax bill I recently received. Thank you to everyone at West Coast Funding.

My family and I were stationed overseas, the time difference was a concern of ours when purchasing a home in San Diego. Shane, Stephanie, and the team at West Coast Funding alleviated all concerns. Shane and Stephanie were involved from start to finish an always kept us in the loop. They worked day and night with multiple agents to get us estimates for prospective homes along with any information we required.

The team was always responsive and worked diligently to get us a loan and home we were comfortable with. I do not believe we would have been able to purchase a home using any other lender!

Military/veteran friendly but best of all family friendly as they were intuitive and helpful to our families needs and wants. When there was an issue (with another party in the escrow process) Shane stepped in and gave us the peace of mind we needed. We will be using West Coast Funding again for any future home/real estate needs.< /Text>

I have had the best experience with financing  and re-financing VA home loan. Casey has gone above and beyond to help me and my family. He was even answering questions, while I was deployed to Afghanistan, that were outside financing a home. I would recommend WCF to anyone that is looking for home financing help. Make to have Casey and his team on your side. Thank you, Saul.< /Text>

Our family has been using West Coast Funding for 11 years.  We have refinanced for lower payments 3 times.  Each time our experience has been positive.  They are courteous and professional.  Our first purchase was just as the market fell apart in 2008.  They worked some magic to get it done.  They answered all our questions, sometimes more than once.  I have recommended them to co workers and friends, and coworkers who are friends.  Everyone who talked to Troy and Brandon’s team said the competition could not come close to their rates.    We say no one comes close to their service or knowledge.<//Review>

<Text>My family and I were stationed overseas, the time difference was a concern of ours when purchasing a home in San Diego. Shane, Stephanie, and the team at West Coast Funding alleviated all concerns. Shane and Stephanie were involved from start to finish an always kept us in the loop. They worked day and night with multiple agents to get us estimates for prospective homes along with any information we required.

The team was always responsive and worked diligently to get us a loan and home we were comfortable with. I do not believe we would have been able to purchase a home using any other lender!

Military/veteran friendly but best of all family friendly as they were intuitive and helpful to our families needs and wants. When there was an issue (with another party in the escrow process) Shane stepped in and gave us the peace of mind we needed. We will be using West Coast Funding again for any future home/real estate needs.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Troy and Tom at West Coast Funding are truly a class act.  They will certainly go the extra mile to ensure you get the best rate possible.  They are not in business just to make money, they strive to make a difference in your financial life.  Our loan was certainly not an easy loan given some unexpected obstacles along the way.  Tom and Troy made sure they considered every possibility to make our dream of buying the house of our dreams a reality.  Tom, the class act that he is, also gave us a house warming gift in spite of us insisting it was not really necessary.  Six months later when the rates dropped and it was time to re-finance we trusted our loan with Tom and Troy.  They did not disappoint; once again they came through with impeccable timing and got us a great rate and lower monthly mortgage.  Thanks Troy and Tom for your hard work and taking such good care of us.  If Troy tells you it can be done, you can rest assured he will do it and get you the best rate.<//Text>

West coast funding is a very helpful and efficient company to do business with. Casey Peek is very knowledgeable and worked above and beyond to get my loan funded. I highly recommend Casey to do the job.

<Text>Troy / West Coast Funding is one of the best lending groups I have worked with. Their customer service is excellent, the rates are great, and their high level of ethics and transparency is refreshing in this industry.  I have completed multiple loans with West Coast Funding and they helped me finance, and refinance, my personal home. You will be very glad you worked with Troy and his team!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Casey broke down each step of our refi so it was super understandable and always responded to my questions quickly. He was able to call me outside of my 9-5 which other companies I contacted refused to. He realized I preferred texting as well which the bulk of our communication was through which made it even easier to move the process along.

We saved a ton of money going through West Coast Funding and I will only use/recomend them in the future.<//text><user_id>102370952827303453217<//user_id>< user_name>

Shane is simply the best there is. Period. He helped me secure my first home purchase last year and then helped me again this year with a refinance that significantly lowered my rate. He's incredibly transparent, attentive and always on your side. I would recommend him and his team to anyone looking to navigate the home purchase/refinance waters with complete confidence and trust.< /text>

As a first time home buyer, I was very naive to all the paperwork that went into purchasing a home. Shane and Kaylah stayed on top of all of it, and were able to clearly explain anything I was having difficulty understanding. If you are looking for a VA Loan I highly recommend their services. Without them I am convinced it would have taken a much longer time to close on my house.< /text>

I just had the pleasure of working with Shane on a home closing last week. We faced quite a bit of challenges that were beyond his control, but he was very proactive with his communication and put his clients best interests at the forefront. I was the listing broker and he was doing the loan for the buyer (who were not my clients) but I felt compelled to write a review because my interaction with Shane was so positive. He does a great job for his clients and I hope to work with him again in the future.</review>

Shane was spectacular. This is our second home purchase and a far better experience than our first. He took care of all the VA paperwork, and worked with them to secure my eligibility within a week of closing the sale of our other home. If you are considering a purchase, stop looking with Shane Stokes at West Coast Funding. All you will have to do is find your next home and wait for the closing date!</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I was a first-time home buyer and had a phenomenal experience with West Coast Funding.  I worked with Troy Moritz and Stephanie Garmo and both provided exceptional service throughout the process, making themselves available day and night to answer questions and to make sure the loan was ready well ahead of schedule.

I shopped around, and Go West Coast either beat or matched the rates of any lender that I found, offered (and delivered) a faster turnaround time and provided better overall service.  I highly recommend West Coast Funding, and plan to work with Troy and Stephanie again for future refinances and home purchases.

Edit:  As an update to my prior review, I just worked with Troy and Stephanie on a refinance, and received the same top-notch service that I experienced in connection with the original mortgage.  West Coast gave me an unbeatable deal on the refinance, and I couldn't be happier with the experience and the outcome.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Shane and Kaylah were there helping me every step of the way not only assisting, but teaching me all about the VA loan and home buying process. They were patient with all of my crazy questions and quick to respond at all times of the day. There aren’t words to describe how thankful I am for them and the help they provided me through this whole process.

<Text>As first time home buyers Casey and Troy put our minds at ease knowing we had a strong partner walking us through the lending process.  Their level of communication was above and beyond what we could have expected or hoped - they were highly responsive and proactive in reaching out.  Both were very professional, timely, and understanding, even when we asked the same questions a few times.

We already have recommended them to friends and family, will continue to do so in the future, and will leverage their services again when we buy our next home.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I would highly recommend this company to others for their home refinance. Again, thanks for the professionalism and making this a great experience.< /Review><Time>1562686991220</Time>< Resp>

<user>112707860386045075015</user><text>Troy & the team at West Coast Funding do a great job - 5 star all-around. We have used them to refinance multiple times & honestly wouldn’t consider using anybody else. They are highly professional & take care of business quickly & efficiently. Over the years, Troy & his team have treated us like family & have gone out of their way to accommodate us & our busy work schedules, kids’ schedules, & travel, etc to take care of business. Kaylah assisted us with our last refi & did an awesome job....Highly recommended!</text>< rate>

<text>Shane Stokes and Kaylah Miller are true professionals in the home loan business. I recently purchased a home with my girlfriend and Shane and Kaylah took care of all of the financial aspects of the process. From getting us pre approved for our VA loan, to securing funding and writing the mortgage, Shane and Kaylah made the whole process painless. The level of personal service provided by the WCF was so above and beyond what we expected, we cannot recommend them enough. During these uncertain times, Shane, Kaylah, and the whole WCF team are the people you want walking you through the home buying process.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>We recently purchased our first home, and when we finally chose a lender, Steven Tavera and his team handle our transaction. Purchasing a home  can be a nightmare, especially when there are several moving components and people involved. This transaction though, was very smooth from the beginning, thanks to Steven. He ensured we were on track every step of the way. Steven possesses a quality rarely found in today's lending agents--he returns calls and emails promptly. His work for us was punctual, professional, and I would highly recommend Steven and his company to anyone looking for a hassle-free mortgage loan. Thanks, Steven Tavera!< /Text><gmapID>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969<//gmapID>< Resp>

Shane and Kaylah were simply amazing at getting us approved and set up with our VA Loan. They both responded quickly to all of our questions, as well as always had answers. However, the best part is that they made the whole process so easy! Thanks again.<//Review>

Troy and Stephanie were fantastic handling the recent refinance of my home. They were prompt friendly and efficient. They answered all my questions and were available whenever I needed them. They even helped me out on my Home Equity Line of Credit after the refinance was complete. Not to mention they saved me hundreds of dollars a month by locking in a great interest rate and getting rid of my PMI. Thank you Troy, Stephanie and all of those at West Coast Funding. They are true professionals and made the process easy and painless. Check them out if you want to save money and have a phenomenal experience!<//Review>

Casey did an awesome job handling our recent refi when we moved from a 30yr to a 15yr. He locked in a great rate and made the process a piece of cake from start to finish. He was proactive, transparent, and responsive, and despite the refi occurring in the midst of a pandemic he made it go as smooth as it could. I highly recommend West Coast Funding, and thanks to them we never have to worry about another refi again.</Review>

Shane was great to work with. As first time home buyers, he made the process easier for us. He was professional and didn’t hesitate to contact us to give updates. I greatly appreciated his open communication and willingness to explain things. We had lots of questions about the lending process and he (and Stephanie) never made us feel like an inconvenience. We have already recommended WCF to friends because of the positive experience we had with Shane. Thank you!<//Text>

This review is for Casey. I got introduced to Troy through a friend and got connected with Casey. Both men were really welcoming and very happy to guide me through the process. I am a first time home buyer and was really overwhelmed by the process. Casey was more than available to help. What I mean is that he was available at anytime through texts, emails, and calls. I was well taken care of by Casey. He answered all my questions and kept me updated through this grueling process. I could not have gone through this without Casey. I highly recommend this company because of their superb professionalism and great accessibility. Go to West Coast Funding for your lending needs!<//text>

Shane was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was willing to work long hours and go the extra mile during our home buying process. Every home loan faces it’s own set of challenges but Shane and his team were able to jump those hurdles without every missing a step. I would highly recommend him to anyone searching for a competitive home loan in today’s market. I would use him again for any future home loans.< /review>

<Review>We worked with Casey and are really impressed by West Coast Funding - seriously above and beyond! They got us an amazing rate,  were incredibly responsive (near instantaneous) and had great attention to detail. There are a lot of moving pieces for a mortgage and there was not a single error on any document they handled, which is extremely rare for the lending business. So thankful we worked with them!</Review>< date>

Couple of weeks ago I purchased a condo house , I hired West Coast Funding Team .Chuck ,Maricruz , Griselda team .It was a quick Smooth process and pleasant experience dealing with the whole Team . I learned that big names on Real State don’t mean much for the most part they see us customers as numbers as well as their only personal business. I sure highly recommend West Coast Funding . Special thanks to Mr. Chuck Maricruz and Griselda. And team .keep up the good work .<//Review>

Shane helped me purchase the home of my dreams this summer and I surely couldn't have done it without him. He was professional, courteous, and speedy when I needed him to be. I would highly recommend the WCF team to anyone looking to buy or sell real estate! Thanks man.</review></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I are first time homeowners. So we most definitely did not know what was gonna be involved with getting a loan. Thanks to Shane and Kaylah they made it possible for us to be able to purchase a home in a short amount of time. They made things quick and simple, and always answered our questions. 10/10 would recommend Shane and Kaylah< /Review>

<text>I was already cornered by a ridiculous FHA loan offer when I reached out to Chuck about VA loan.  Long story short, Chuck's email reaching out to veterans about VA loan worked like a charm. Next thing you know Maricruz was all over paperwork and boom! . . CLOSED in less than 15days. Superb team!  Btw, check out Chuck's VA educational segments in YouTube.  Thank you Chuck, Maricruz and the WCF 24/7 team.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>I worked with Shane on buying my first home and I can't express enough how helpful he was. He made this scary process exciting and very easy. No matter what time or day he was always there to answer our call about any questions we had. He's very professional, trustworthy, and knowledgeable. He goes above and beyond with helping us even when escrow is over. We will continue to work with him in the future with refinances or buying another home. I highly recommend anybody that is either in the market or interested in home buying to contact Shane!< /Review><username>Crisinda Quiroga<//username><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

<Review>Troy has class and skill.  He's incredibly knowledgeable, honest, trustworthy, flexible when necessary, and he knows how to get a deal done.  Your bottom line is his priority, he works to understand and achieve what will be best for you, and he won't try to sell or pitch you.  He's also just a really cool guy.

We were first time home buyers.  Troy was patient, we always knew what to expect, and he and his office (thank you, Tom!) were consistent and responsive.  Troy gained the respect and admiration of our agent, the escrow agent, - and the listing agent.  Because of Troy and Tom, we overcame the sellers' concerns and we even closed early.  We'll never work with anyone else.< /Review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

When Chuck told me he could help us refinance and get it closed in a short period of time, I was very skeptical and I told him that. Our situation was not cut and dry and required more work then normal but Chuck delivered just like he said he would! Maricruz processed everything for us like a pro. She even went out of her way to contact our appraiser when there was a discrepancy. Both of them answered every phone call and email within minutes. I was never in the dark about where we were in the process. It could not have been any easier and I will definitely be back for future needs. Thanks again Chuck and Maricruz!< /text>< Date>

We utilized the VA loan to purchase our home and West Coast Funding is very knowledgeable on that process. Shane Stokes and his assistant Kaylah Miller went above and beyond to ensure we not only got the best rate, but to educate us every step of the way. Buying a home and can be a scary process but I felt like we were in such good hands on the lender side that it helped alleviate the majority of our stress.

<Time>1553100814636<//Time><rate>5<//rate><Text>We worked closely with Brandon and Rachel to get a home in Colorado. The market here is no joke and Brandon, Rachel, and West Coast Funding were the difference maker in landing a house with close to 20 offers on it! We weren't even the highest offer, but the speed at which West Coast could close as well as the buttoned-up presentation of the offer pushed us to the top of the heap. I was astounded by their work ethic. These guys are literally available 24/7 and bulldogged our deal from the beginning through the finish line. I did my due diligence and had a couple other lenders on the line, but no one could match the speed and availability of West Cost Funding. Thank you guys!< /Text>< pictures>

This was our very first time to purchase a house.Rachel was there every step of the way. We were inexperienced and a bit confused about the whole process. Rachel would explain what every term meant and how it played out through the process. She made us feel very secure with our purchase price and assured us that we were in good hands. Their company truly knows the meaning of teamwork. They worked fast and very smart on the details. I have recommended her to family and friends already. We are very happy with our purchase and want everyone to experience her professional expertise in the real estate world. Thank you for the TLC. You've made buying a house so simple. Our family can't say how grateful we are to you and the team at west coast funding. Thank You❤️<//review>

<text>Seriously have to say the best experience I have had while owning my home. Shane made it easy and I swear this dude never sleeps. I never met him in person but he has become family. What he said he could do, he did!. If you are looking for a smooth transaction from a trustworthy source, Shane is your guy. I wish I could give him and his assistant a million stars. He followed up with me as he said , even 6 months later!  He will get all my future business and I recommend him to all my friends!< /text>< pics>

I worked with Shane and Kaylah at West Coast Funding on my refinance. They are a dynamite team and gave me peace of mind throughout the home loan process. They were always available and worked around my schedule.  As a realtor myself, I greatly appreciated the immediate responses to my questions and constant follow-up. Shane helped me lock my rate in at the right time by keeping me up to date with the market trends. Kaylah assisted me with the documents needed to close the loan and provided updates on my loan status throughout the process. I highly recommend Shane and Kaylah to anyone looking for stress-free home loan experience.< /Text>

I can’t say enough great things about Shane! He worked around the clock to make this experience seamless, get us the best rate, and took the extra time to educate us with this new and what initially seemed like an intimidating process. His professionalism, response time to texts, emails, and open communication was extremely appreciated. He cared for us and invested himself into getting this home as much as we did.  I felt reassured the entire time and confident knowing that Shane was handling everything. We will definitely be referring West Coast Funding and Shane to all of our friends and family looking to get a loan.< /Review>< pictures>

I had just recently purchased a duplex that I never thought would be mine through the help of Shane, Kaylah and  their team. I'm a single female, in the military, who was able to purchase a duplex in downtown area. Typically unusual, but his team performed so well, I'm honestly not even sure how they managed to help me close on this house. They made my first home buying experience so easy, I was shocked myself, the process was so easy, I started to get nervous, I had expected a more dreading process... I had hiccups along the way but he always assured me it's something he can make happen. We were actually able to close earlier than expected dates(less than 30 days), they were working weekends and holidays with me just to make my first home purchase happen. They were very easy to talk to, always available and to what I think, gave me the best deal. They werent scared of my situation and took a strong approach, with confidence to close the deal. As a member of the military, they were very knowledgeable about handling VA loans and I have always recommended them to my peers! Thanks again Shane and Kaylah!< /Review>

Talk about getting down to business.  Knowledge is power.  They have the knowledge.  Let's just say the refinance had some complications.  A very skilled group of people maneuvered the process quickly and professionally.  They satisfied all outside parties quickly and got the loan through.

Great rates, quick response, I am glad they are on my side.

Thank you,< /Text>

Troy Moritz from West Coast Funding has been a longtime friend of mines, recently I refinanced my home through West Coast Funding, the process was simple, timely, and I could've asked for a better person to work with in regards to refinancing my home.

Troy's expertise in this field, made my refinancing process seamless.  Troy was able to explain my HUD in detail from top to bottom, giving me a clear understanding of where my fees were going, and how they were applied, along with where my credits were coming from, a true professional nonetheless.

From the very beginning Troy was on-point.  My refinancing was pretty complex based on a lot of surprises that came up, in which I needed to clear up, and Troy was very patient, and stayed the course and educated me in every way possible to make my refinance possible.

At the end of the day, Troy is one of the only individuals I would trust w/any of my real estate financial needs, we even discussed future ways to get a better rate down the road, I really appreciate his proactive approach to ensuring I have the best loan possible!< /text>

I executed a VA remortgage with cash out through West Coast Funding working with Shane Stokes and Stepanie Garmo. Shane worked with me for a couple of months to aid my decision in the right product and timing, and then both Shane and Stephanie helped me navigate the process including working odd hours and continuing to process the loan while work took me to Australia , working off hours to correspond with me and help line up and rectify issues with the home survey and other issues. Everything was resolved smoothly, the loan closed with a good provider and I cannot say enough good things about this team. Their care and support for me throughout the process was exemplary, well above my expectations. Thank you both.<//review>

Troy crushed it for us. This was our third refi with West Coast. I wouldn’t even consider going anywhere else. Why pay more for slower service and higher rates?<//Text>

Brandon is awesome! This is the third time I have refinanced through West Coast Funding. When interest rates dropped to a point where it was beneficial for me to refinance, Brandon contacted me immediately. They made the process so stress free and easy. I would recommend everyone to use West Coast Funding. Many thanks!< /review>

West Coast Funding was impressive from the very beginning! My wife and I were in escrow on an investment property in North Park and met Shane Stokes, at a nearby open house. We already had financing in place and were interested mostly in looking at décor for ideas on our own rehab. Shane immediately caught my attention because of his knowledge and professionalism. After our chance encounter, Shane reached out to me regarding the terms of our existing financing and assured me his firm could do better. I already had firm financing terms from 3 other firms and was satisfied with my options, but figured I would hear him out. I filled out the required paperwork and finalized critical details with the Loan Consultant, Brandon Martinez. The process was easy and painless. The founder, Troy Moritz, then gave me a call to iron out the details. Troy is exceptional and it is no surprise that he is as successful as he is. He cared genuinely about my current situation and my long-term goals. It should be known that my wife and I invest heavily in real estate as our retirement strategy and we have very specific goals in mind. We were not looking to save a few basis points on our interest rate. We were looking to build a relationship with a lender that could build a financing structure that could be repeated for numerous real estate transactions in the next 5 years and Troy offered just that. Not only could he beat the best financing arrangements I could find, but he did so with an incredible team that was second to none. Once we secured financing, the rest was history. Rachel Gonzalez brought it all together streamlining the mounds of paperwork, salary verification, etc. She was extremely responsive and knew exactly what she needed from us.  As the last days of escrow approached, the team worked smoothly to ensure our needs were met. It is worth mentioning that the seller was extremely difficult to work with and tried multiple tactics to delay the close of escrow. The West Coast Funding team worked all hours to ensure all last-minute questions, delays, and controversies were resolved with our best interest in mind.  The entire experience went above and beyond my expectations and I would recommend the firm to my friends and families for all their funding needs. I look forward to the next opportunity we have to work with the West Coast Funding team.< /review>

Troy and West Coast Funding went above and beyond my greatest expectations in securing a house refinancing loan.  I had experienced difficulties with another lender and it seemed that the issues involved in my case were absolutely handled with the greatest speed and most beneficial outcome that I possibly could have expected.  I know the issues were complicated but in all my dealings with Troy, I never experienced a negative word or feeling.  He was extremely knowledgeable, professional, efficient, and positive in every respect, and I would highly recommend him and his company to anyone looking for the best finance company in California, bar none!  Thank you, Troy, and West Coast Funding very much for a job superbly done!</review>

<text>Jordan V. was more patient  and understanding, I wanted to refi my first and second loans into one 30 yr. fix, And he made it happen, we nearly lost our home not once but twice in the last 12 years we been in it, do to the economy, we somehow managed to survive. I was very skeptical and I can not tell you the concerns I had with just choosing any lender. Jordan answered the tough questions, the obvious questions, and probably a few silly questions, in other words he made me feel comfortable in everything we were doing. 30yr fix at 3.75%, it took some time, but we finally closed, and even got a little cash back. Great Job!!</text>< username>

Worked primarily with Troy and Rachel.  They came recommended by our realtor and had a good working relationship.  Wrote a custom pre-approval for each offer we made(two separate properties) and had great turnaround time for any questions asked/information I needed.   We did our rate shopping after we got started with Troy, we did find a better rate from another company.  I presented it to Troy and he matched the rate as well as the lender fee, then beat the fee by twenty bucks.  Definitely made me happy as I would much prefer to work with someone I can call/text/meet in person over the internet only company I got the other rate from.  During the loan process, I was kept up to date during every step along the way.  Each time they did something or needed something, I would get notification and send back required documents.  We had a 21 day escrow and were able to close on time.  Highly recommend, even if you find a better rate, give it to Troy and he'll match it.  Pleasure to work with.<//text>

What can I say about this company. A whole lot. I give praise to Shane Stokes and his entire team.  I am so skeptical of lenders after all this is my home. I was referred to Shane by one of my colleagues and I said okay fine I'll try him.  I was working closely with two other lenders but I felt uncomfortable with them. Then I met Shane. And oh my goodness what a difference a conversation makes. This young man worked with me, the turnover was quickly done, and absolutely professional. He's also very comical easy to talk to which meant a lot for them to me. He made me feel at ease with the entire process. At the end of the day I was able to pay off several liens that was on my property; the HERO lien, switched over to an excellent Mortgage Company, and put a little change in my pocket. The team that he works with, are so fast and so easy to talk to. I felt so it he's dealing with this entire process which only took really and less than a month.  Shane not only held my hand through this entire process, he educated me on different areas, and even does follow-ups after the loan has closed. He's like a big brother. Yeah a big brother. Shane and his team are awesome, you will not regret working with this young man and his leadership team. They're the best. Thank you so much for everything that you have done for me and my family.<//text>

<Text>I have used West Coast Funding to refinance 3 times now, and have had nothing but an excellent experience both times. My refinances were always very timely, very efficient, and everyone we encountered was professional, courteous, and prompt. The rates were great, and the price for the refi can't be beat!

I continually refer my friends and coworkers to this service for their loans, and everyone has been pleased with their experience as well.< /Text><name>andrea dietzen< /name><UserId.>116195844648587139783< /UserId.>< rate>

Troy and the WCF team are the greatest and most professional lenders I have ever dealt with.  Had the pleasure of being referred about 18 months ago where he saved me from a terrible refi offer.  Quickly he got me a better offer and reduced my payment significantly.  Recently he converted my loan from VA to conventional and once again he made the process easy, seamless and got me the absolute best deal.  I would recommend him to all my friends and he will be the only person I go to in the future should I need a loan.< /Text>

My wife and I were referred to West Coast Funding by a company that assisted us in updating our credit scores. Our end goal was to refinance our home. I made a call to West Coast Funding on my way to pick up my grandson from school and was connected with George Magana. My occupation is sales and I commonly speak with executives in various industries. I was immediately at ease finding George unusually easy to converse with. By the time I completed the 4 mile round trip to pick up my grandson George had explained the entire process to me including the timeline, (about 5 weeks) from start to finish. He provided a very accurate assessment of the equity we had in our home along with the interest rate we probably would qualify for.  George emailed me a small list of items which were easy to provide and started the process. He maintained outstanding follow up with us and explained every step along the way. 5 weeks later we are done and my wife and I are ecstatic.George demonstrated an ability to make the entire process seamless. He left us with a lasting impression of an outstanding customer experience. I highly recommend George Magana and West Coast Funding</review>

We recently purchased a home and used West Coast Funding to obtain our mortgage.  West Coast provides stellar service.  All of their associates are so professional and customer oriented.  They worked with us every step of the way and got us the best possible mortgage.  I would highly recommend West Coast Funding to anyone who is looking for a mortgage or looking to refinance their home.<//Review>

Working with Shane Stokes (and his team) was the best broker experience I've had yet!  This was my 2nd home purchase but I've worked with a few brokers in the past and Shane exceeding my expectations by far!  His style matched mine perfectly- he's straight and to the point, explains things well, is courteous of my schedule and helped me work through busy days very easily (via quick calls, texts, emails), etc.  He had the same sense of urgency I work under and expect of my partners; he shopped for a better deal for me (even after first deal was approved) and never let off the gas.  He even went above & beyond at times- when the seller's agent was slow to react or not very cooperative, he made phone calls to assist in the process.  He even offered to help us rent a U-HAUL and load up personal belongings that we felt the seller was going to leave behind (so we didn't move into a new house with a bunch of junk leftover).  Though that was not needed in the end, it showed us how willing Shane was to make our experience the smoothest possible (outside of his "requirements" as just our broker).  I will definitely refer Shane to all of my friends & family, work my re-finance options with him, and look forward to working with Shane on my future loans/purchases!  A++</Review>

Refinancing at a lower rate was a breeze with West Coast Funding. West Coast funding is really customer focused. Its not the first time that I have dealt with them and they surely can be trusted, I got my own experience on that matter.</review>

<Review>In the fall of 2011 our prospects of securing a home purchase seemed bleak.  No financial institution was willing to work with us.  We turned to West Coast Funding as our last resort and we could not have been happier.  They made our dream of home ownership become a reality.  Since then we have done multiple transactions with them and their services have been unmatched.  Brandon is very easy to work with and his deep knowledge of the business makes it easy to complete the tedious loan process.<//Review><user_name>jorge zurita<//user_name><Time>1464728876558</Time>< response>

Troy does an amazing job at evaluating all possible options and discussing the risks/benefits to ensure I understood my choices.  He was able to find the best possible rates and close as quickly as possible.  He was flexible and willing to work with my crazy schedule and changing needs.  Thank you for your hard work!!< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>From my first contact with West Coast Funding, was beyond impressed by Brandon Martinez and the phenomenal team (Vito Russo and Troy Moritz).They solved every puzzle our rather complicated financing scenario demanded!

They hit it out of the park for us and, from all the the glowing reviews you will read, for EVERY ONE of their clients.

There are those that make it happen, wait for it to happen, or wonder why it happened. Brandon, Vito, Troy and WCF just MAKE IT HAPPEN.

I'm an unabashed fan!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>West Coast Funding, led by Troy Moritz is an outstanding company.  I recommend them to anyone looking for a new mortgage, or as i was, looking to refi.  Troy and his team worked with me, patiently and with great attitude, through an extremely difficult set of circumstances.  Thanks Troy and Team.  They got it done for me.  I'm a very satisfied customer.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I just closed my refi with West Coast Funding so I can remodel my home.  My previous experience with another lender was extremely stressful.  Brandon and his team handled all the tedious legwork and I wasn't bothered with the hassle of submitting new and updated documents over and over again.  They were able to do things quick enough that I only needed to gather the loan requirements once...thank God! I appreciate you guys being  quick, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  Not to mention, they got me the best rate at the lowest cost that I could find.  I would recommend them 100%.</Text><time>1463114758211< /time><userid>109103596667050242981<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Joe Haslego<//user_name><pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I looked over two months to find someone to refinance our house so that we could put a new roof on.  Just a word to the wise if you need a new roof most lenders will not refinance you because you do not have a good roof you have to have a good to refinance. Yeah it is a catch 22. Teena Broumand was willing to put the money in an escrow account something ever other loan officer I talked to did not even mention. Teena Broumand is a professional in every sense of the word.  She is extremely personable, asks the right questions, possesses an expert knowledge of the lending process. She had the lending institution’s representative come to our house when we executed the loan.

We have not only obtained a loan that meets our financial needs, more importantly, we have made a friend. I have no qualms referring people to Teena, and will continue to do so.  If we had a need for another loan, we would not hesitate to contact Teena< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>This has been the worst loan process I have ever been in. It is hard enough to get the paperwork once but with them I had to get it several times because they said they never got it. After the 4 th month we did some research on them and found out there loan processor is not licensed. No background check and she (Lisa) had all of my information including bank records, all of my account numbers, and social security numbers. I have spoke with the dept. of R.E. and they indicated they may be committing fraud. I am a Veteren and I think I deserve better than this so I went to a legitimate company with honest people.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969< /GmapID>< rating>

Troy Moritz and the entire team at West Coast Funding couldn't have been more professional during the process of refinancing our home. Stephanie Garmo and Shantel Olvera were especially very diligent in ensuring that my wife and I received a great rate. Without a doubt, we will be using them again for any financial services we may need in the future.

Troy Moritz is the LeBron of loans.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Troy has refinanced us 3 times in the last 18 months. Every time rates go down I call him and he's more than happy to help me get the ball rolling same day! He makes the process so easy. I don't know if I'm supposed to say this but it never costs me a dime. If I was paying a fee to do this every time like in the old days, I'd think twice, but at the end of the day if I can lower my payment for free, I'd be stupid not to do it. You're nuts if you're going with somebody else.

PS... I even let him refi my mother and she's been back to him with both of her properties twice now. She's a big fan too which is really saying something!</text>< pictures>

Our experience with West Coast Funding and Real Estate Inc was amazing. We were able to refinance two properties at the best terms and rates. The process was handled with high professionalism and responsibility. All requests were completed in a timely fashion and Troy Moritz provided an outstanding service. We're extremely happy and sincerely recommend the company to anyone who needs financing or other real estate services.

After an exhausting search I determined that West Coast had the absolute best rate for my situation and Troy's team was the most upfront and honest of the companies I dealt with.  Everything went really smoothly and my home was purchased with ease.  I also refinanced with West Coast Funding when rated dipped lower, which was just as smooth as our first transaction.  I have sent multiple friends to West Coast Funding for new home purchases and re-fis and everyone of them has been so impressed that they've sent referrals to WCF.  I would highly recommend WCF to anyone looking to purchase a home in California.<//Text>

<Review>We knew about "George Magana" of West Coast Funding through my brother who had an amazing experience working with him in mortgage refinancing in a timely and efficient manner. We have expressed our frustration dealing with various lenders for refinancing to my brother and he then referred us to George in mid November 2016. We decided to reach out to George and he's absolutely phenomenal! We explained our scenarios to him and he gave us several different options and helped us figure out one that will work best for us.
We have just finished our refinancing with George Magana of West Coast Funding and it was a great process from start to finish. We
were contacted by multiple lenders and no one was as knowledgeable, respectful and responsive than "George Magana". He answers all our questions thoroughly and made a usually stressful process very smooth and stress-free. He's all upfront, very clear and extremely efficient. He's very thoughtful and really made us feel supported and ensure that we understood and knew our options.
Overall, amazing experience and will continue to use them for our mortgage needs and will highly recommend "George Magana" to our family and friends.< /Review>< Rating>

We have used West Coast Funding and Real Estate Services for two refinances now.  I have found working with Brandon Martinez to be pleasant and easy.  The rates he was able to give us were great and the cost to refi was PERFECT!  We will definetly use their services again and I would refer them/him to anyone wishing to refi, which says a lot, because I don't take referrals lightly.<//review>

I had refinanced my condo with Mr. Cody Coleman, that we had ran into a lots of problem, yet he was so patient and got it done. I recommend him to anyone who is looking for an agent to refinance.<//text>

Authentic atmosphere with a Floral outside patio. Very nice people. And the gnarliest margaritas in South Bay. No joke. Get you one
UPDATE:
On my last visit they changed their Margaritas size and the flavor. Very disappointing, when you consider that the restaurant is known for its margaritas. Not something you want to change. I'd rethink that one Las Brisas...< /review>

I get to eat here a lot since I work close by. I have to say the service is always fantastic and they keep the spot clean consistently. Pricing is convenient and they serve generous portions.< /review>

This is one of the little gems of the South Bay. They are open and serving amazing food during the ‘My Sharona’ situation. You can even get margaritas to go.

Currently, they are cash only. Be prepared.</review>

This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the South Bay. The old school booths and decor are what really set it apart. The food is good and the service is friendly. They have a huge bar and there is a party room and outdoor patio downstairs available for private parties. This place is one of the best kept secrets in LA.< /review>

As legit as it gets. Without a doubt some great cooking that will remind you of of your grandma's Mexican cooking... If your grandma was Mexican. We're pretty sure someone's grandma was back in the kitchen slinging Spanish rice, tortillas and sauce. It's fantastic and quite reasonable</Review>

<review>Excellent food and service.  Meal #4 is my favorite.  1 enchilada, 1 taco, 1 burrito, salad, chips and salsa. Was so full I couldn't finish the meal. Took the burrito, rice and beans home.  Only $11.75!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Food is ok. They cook alot with canned ingredients.  Also, I think they add peas to their guacamole  -- it has a weird texture.</text>

<Name>Sandra Conway< /Name><Review>This place has been around for years!  The have the traditional mexican restaurant menu, a full bar, authentic atmosphere, but a small dining room.   On Friday nights they have live music.  We are not drinkers but they must sell the best Margaritas because we were the only ones there that did not have one!  Almost pushed me over edge to give one a try!  A good place for authentic mexican!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2b463ad1001fd:0x7a70692717e8b313< /gmapID><Time>1560222248970<//Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><userid>103332494055733220456<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It was good overall. But it is kinda like old fashioned. They need a remodel. The food comes out pretty quickly. They say the margaritas are good but I didn't get it. They have a variety of flavors too. They have live music on fridays. Small bar. I appreciate a salsa so them having 3 kinds were good. All 3 good too. Recommend at least going once.<//Review>< pictures>

The tortilla chips are homemade and the two salsas tasted delicious. The guacamole is light and less salty. Our meals were hot and prepared as expected. The flavor was excellent. The service was prompt and very polite. Although there were some low-scoring reviews, we decided that it was best to decide for ourselves. Las Brisas is not trying to be a 4-star restaurant, but it does very well for the price and for traditional Mexican fare. We would recommend this restaurant!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Four star patio, but it's all downhill from there.  Really poor food and service.  Chips with melted shredded cheese on top (Step Brothers style) does not a dish make. Margarita was large but tasteless and void of booze.  Maybe an off day if you read the other reviews?<//text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Ordered chips and salsa to go. Lady told me it was going to be $3.00 But when she brought out the salsa then said the total was $9.60🤨 Paid it, good salsa, just didn't understand why so much.</review><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Jeff Simmons<//user_name><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Good margaritas, good enough Mexican food. It's​ fine if you feel like Mexican and you're already in the area, but of all the amazing places in Los Angeles, this is not a destination.< /text>

Service was slow considering it was not busy, soups were good, entrees were not good at all, rice was bland and kind of hard. I asked for carne asade and thats not what I  got. It was a steak! Not at all happy with this restaurant.</review>

<Review>The front desk, the swimming coaches and the staff in general are awesome, caring, friendly people. The members in the gym are super friendly.  It's the best of San Diego Y,s.

Why aren't they open yet????
My family misses being there :(<//Review>< GmapID>

<Review>I love the Palomar YMCA because it is clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the price is definitely great. They do offer scholarships based on income. My family qualified for one, so I pay a mere $20 per month for 5 people. All of the classes I have tried have been very good. Right now, my favorite is Bender Ball because it is new and different for me. The thing that really makes this YMCA stand out for me is the salt water therapy pool. OMG... I am training for roller derby, and NOTHING gets my sore body to relax like a soak in the therapy pool! Lastly, I have a 10 year old son who comes to this YMCA with me. He loves the classes, swimming, and the workout room. There are many machines that he is able to use. There has been an upgrade recently. Many new machines and features have been added at this facility. I can't wait to go today to try them out. There are also many incentives to come work out or just relax, and free training in additional to the staff always available to help. Gosh, so many great reasons to come to this YMCA... Free days for people to come try it out ..<//Review>< rate>

The first two times, the employees didn’t know how to take a payment over the phone.  I was waiting for a manager to call me back.  They never did, so I called a third time.  A friendly young woman named Eunice answered.  She took my payment with no problems, she was professional, kind and polite.  She knew deadlines for payments etc.  I was going to cancel until I spoke with her.  From now on, when I call, I’m asking for Eunice.

Front desk people are duplicitous and ignorant of policy. Also, the place smells funky and has poor climate control, which is important in this climate-conscience world of ours. Attendants are aggressive. Would give 0 stars if Google wasn't promoting Star Inflation, but they are.</review>

Plus they say they are Christians however Christmas time I visited some YMCA in California and was not any Nativity or Christian decoration only Christmas tree. Why they did not included the Nativity decoration? I think was a little hypocritical.</text>< Pics>

It's a good place, but not a good neighborhood. They're camps are kind of expensive (about $250+) and it's mostly high school & college students watching over the kids.< /text>

< Review>
Your rule 5 - lockers will emptied each day. Lockers 155, 174, 175, and 180 has locks been on them for several months. Men's locker shower curtains a mess - need replaced. Insects (ants, etc)

All this after a price increase - go figure.</Review>

Love the bean Barn I do but like the lady below me mentioned... I'm in a line of 11 cars right now! That is not right. I've been waiting now for 22 minutes.

The other bean Barn is very efficient. I really think this one needs to be addressed. I'm late for work now and so frustrated with the girls who work here.
It would be a good idea to either get more workers inside or just change the crew.< /text>

<Text>I really like this the line is always long. So I can't stop as often as I'd like. They give you the same options as Starbucks. Their prices are more reasonable and they're close to home. What I like the most the people who work there are friendly and courteous. Oh and let's not forget that they're size is plain and simple English... Small medium large and extra-large. I don't have to sit in line and figure out what  size is venti vs grande.</Text><Response>{'time': 1592698578601, 'text': 'Thank you Vicki!'}</Response>< time>

Sorry... But I have to say something.... Whoever the crew is on Saturday needs review, a recrew, and renew! the two girls working on Saturday morning literally had 10 cars in a line.... I officially waited in line for one coffee for 37 minutes. It's absurd.... Owner please talk to these girls or get a new crew please 🙏

<review>$75 cents for an extra HALF shot? They charge the same for a whole shot as a half. $6.00 small drink?!!!
What on earth makes the owner think she can charge that much for a drink that is made of "powder mix"?
This lady is ripping everyone off. And poor Placerville doesn't have enough coffee joints so she knows she can abuse customer's wallets. It's honestly just really sad.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1563307426761, 'text': 'Sounds like somebody charged you incorrectly- I’m sorry that happened!

I used to love this place but there are staff members who are inside that don't pay attention to what they're are saying. With my kids in my car my 7 yr old being the oldest hearing them say the f word a few times and then she asking me what a b**ch is.... Please talk to your staff. I'm also upset that you raised your prices again. But I still go every once in a while.< /Text>

Delicious coffee! Definitely worth the stop along the road. Although pleasant, my barista wasn't particularly engaging and not even asked if I wanted my receipt. Guess the personal conversation going on inside was more important. Coffee was good if that's what matters. If looking for service, you might have better luck with another barista.</review>

I love the Bean Barn! Ive had coffee from Starbucks, Peets coffee, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, camino coffee and The Green Bean. Bean Barn definitley ranks number one on their blended iced mochas for me. The ladies there are always nice! Friends and family alike have found this place to be a favorite. The sizes you get are great for the price. If there is ever a problem they are quick to fix it. Love to buy drinks here!< /text>

It's ok, but they make their mocha mix with a powder
mix that seems grainy.< /Review>

Litterally the worst service ever. Waited on hold for more then 2hours. Keep getting transfer and hung up on repeatedly. When I asked if she would take down my number in case we got disconnected She said no. I will not call you back. You can call and wait on hold again. With 45min wait time if the automatic system doesn't click on you first.  All of this to find out they can't do what I needover the phone "due to covid" . Their whole system is a joke right now.<//Text>

The family court mediator's seem more towards the woman's favor in the majority of case's I listened to..... sad.   Get over to the self help center in downtown Riverside for all types of help & info to help you with your case...for Men & Women!<//text>

I read the reviews before going. Surprised to say I got there around 8:20am and was in and out quickly on a Thursday. The woman at the window was thorough in the information she provided. Gave clear instructions. I left without questions. I will say I'm discouraged in the process although it's the justice system and not the staff.< /text>

The Lady at the Self help center laughed at me when I told her my concerns. These clerks here are very bias against Men. This is getting to be too much.

Worse staff ever! Impolite, lazy, entitled and outright rude. Was there waiting over an hour before they closed at 4 and kicked everyone out. The staff at the windows stop taken people around 5-10 mins before they kick everyone out. They just sit there twirling their thumbs for the last few minutes hoping they dont have to take one more person.  The security detail believes they are swat, chasing me down the hall and yelling to take my hoodie off my head after walking threw metal detector and a wand search. Acting like everyone should just know ALL their special rules that you can put your hat back on but not your hood. Then expect to be followed around and get checked up on several times to make sure you're still in line.<//text>

I have to say that the wait wasnt so great BUT I just have to say that the paralegal woman was awesomely helpful! thank you so much for being so kind and so helpful and also to the family court clerk who checked in my paperwork you were absolutely amazing as well!  hats off to both you young ladies and I cannot thank you enough for your kindness and your empathy! it was much appreciated and made this day so much easier to get through.  Keep up the good work! They need to hire you all some more help, you guys deserve it.  Even the civilian security guards and the Sheriffs Deputy that was on duty at the front door also had great attitudes!<//review>

T E R RI B L E!!!! My first visit to Hemet.. I live in Lake Elsinore, after visiting Murrietta , I was directed to Hemet to complete my process.  I waited for over 1 1/2 hours, at 4 pm we where told we are now closed,  if you are not at a window come back tomorrow. I drove 32 miles, on my day off,  waited for over 1 1/2 hours, my number was next.. to be told come back tomorrow to start over again. To make matters worst.  Worst service ever!<//Review>

Fourth time coming in waiting for hours to be seen, so unfair! As soon as it hits 4 the deputies kick you out. People leave and they repeat numbers 4 to 6 times. Not alot of windows open for the mass amount of people.</text>

Let's see the guards at front were the only thing good I can talk about..As the cops are here ,the judge in civil court Cathlene jacobs wasn't even listening to our side of our eviction case..She never sworn us in as it stated in the minutes order online after..We rent a home in which for past 6 months have had mold black inside our walls .downstairs carpet,and basically all through the house due to a leak from upstairs drainage pipe that is broken in 2 places and leaked for a awhile before it finally surfaced and came pouring out are lower closet..we told our landlords and they did nothing so I held the rent .long story short we had city investigate it,a real contractor and had samples sent to a lab in Florida to see if it was harmful mold.all of us had gotten real sick from symtoms that were the same your get from mold..we had outlets electrical that were bad.had to run extension chords in my house...but results being mold was toxic and our manager lady lied.the judge let her and her lawyer speak but when it came to us she was rude cut us off and didn't let us submit evidence.If we could have afforded a lawyer we would of had a chance but were a family of 6 and my lady's ex that she had the kids with us granted no child support to be paid.That's another issue with guess whom?Yes this lovely justice system they have here in hemet.He's just lazy and your more than typical dead best dad and they seem to be related to the judges and cops here, there all lazy and have no common sense or ethics.go to hell all of you crooked ass,lowlifes. We are appealing and hopefully can get a fair trial..this was a total disgrace and like the law enforcement here are totally a bunch of in competent people in positions that shouldn't be..I always called hemet the armpit of the world for a reason it just proved itself.law and rights?yeah not here..pathetic and byast.oh it's a commissioner not a judge that overseen our eviction so I apologize douche bag Catherine Jacobs my bad I guess I should of listened like u did in our case..Thanks again to you supporting douche bag landlords whom lie,break laws,don't care bout repairs and safety of our kids n there health,but just bout that cash ...we had for year and half always paid our rent and wanted nothing for free.we had rent money butcouldnt pay them anymore ,when we 5 months no 6 months ago had told them before we signed about issues and repairs.we followed up a month later than 3 months than before Xmas I was having family over, and still no acknowledgements or even care to come and look at the mold.damage and the havoc it has caused us..but the judge was so determined all ready before we even got to plead our case(i mean tried to and was always cutoff and or not allowed to represent facts ,evidence , and we d of been better off explaining our case to Stevie wonder ...what ms.Jacobs you can't make it as a judge,?so you .are low-level and crooked commisioner..oh don't rent from the atiyas Dr.there just bad business and horrible landlords that don't even have there supposed to be. Rental license to rent legally here..nice</review>

We had a peaceful hike. Beautiful Fall day with only a few fellow hikers.  Nice combination of meadows and forest trails.< /Review>

Only a few hours round trip but a lovely hike through the valley, over the ridge and down into the next valley where Round Lake sits. Good lunch spot at multiple locations around the lake and several camping spots too.</review>< userid>

You start out on the trail at a moderately steep climb which then turns into switchbacks and when you reach the top the forest opens up to this absolutely beautiful meadow with a meandering brook through it and it's just absolutely gorgeous.<//review>

Lots of parking in the shade but get there early especially on the weekend because its popular. Trailhead can take you in a couple diferent directions. Clean and well maintained. Large dumpster for garbage.  Vault style toilets.<//Review>

6 miles, 3 in to the Round Lake 3 back.  It does go further of course.  This portion involved a large uphill that made the better portion of the 1st half of our hike rough but getting out was easy.  Definitely a moderate trail!< /Review>

Some stepping up boulders but very good footing. Not too much altitude change on this leg of the TRT. You do have to walk/run across the freeway at the start. Pit toilets available at the trailhead with no posted trail map. The well trodden trail was easy to follow, but I didn't see blazes that you would need for snowshoeing.

Pretty Aspen trees.  The lake was low - my big dogs were still wading 15 feet from shore.  I ran into about 15 people on a Tuesday afternoon - four mountain bikers and the rest hikers.

Took me about 2 hours round trip at a brisk pace with a 15 minute break at the lake for the dogs to swim.< /Review>< pics>

I don't know what happened to this location. It used to be so full of energy and the atmosphere was welcoming. Today, we came in and the look of the employees made us wanna turn back and walk out the door. It's not a good idea to separate the drinks from the food. Keep them together all in one order. Also... I didn't hear a single team member say thank you or hello to any customers. It took 25 minutes for a side of fries and 1 shake... Hopefully a new management can bring a new energy to this location.</Review>

<Text>The charbroiled cheese burger was on point. The crispy chicken was well crispy not like any other. The fries and the onion rings were tasty and a little soggy personally was pretty decent. But overall the experience was great will for sure revisit this location. I did curbside pick up though the app.</Text><username>Fernando Niebla< /username><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

<review>Went here earlier today to grab late lunch. It's a pretty straightforward process. Order in, then wait outside. They use a megaphone to call in numbers. I got the burger combo with sweet potato fries. In general the food is good, but some of the fries weren't cooked. Not really a big deal, but I wish they would've left the fries in the fryer a bit longer. Hopefully it's a one time thing. Will try to go back again next time to try other menu.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1610997005204, 'text': 'We appreciate your support and business.

Love this place for dinner that we can pickup in parking. Good customer service when we asked for some stuff like banana peppers and cut wholopeano peppers  and rep brought a bag full of them. Loved every aspect of this restaurant...<//Review>

< review>
Ordered two chicken sandwiches now I wish I didn't
The chicken was pre-cooked so when ordered they slap it on the grill to heat. Nothing like dry chicken breast on your club sandwiches.

I always wondered how your order can be ready 5 minutes after placing order online. We'll now you know meat pre-cooked and just sitting on the side. Food not hot upon pick up. I know it's fast food, but this is plain ridiculous.

Don't waste your money unless you want pre-cooked dry chicken.</review>

<text>Better burger chain than many others. Custom burgers to one's taste.  Offer selection of sandwiches and salads. Limited choices of ice cream floats.

Very disappointed. I was excited to eat here my first time but all food was so soggy it was uneditable. Ordered waited for 45min got food and ate right away. Bread on burgers had so much grease and water the bread was gone already. Fries and fried green beans were so greasy they were soggy but had no seasoning either. First and last time going here. Worst burgers I've ever had. Even worse than all fast food burgers but hella expensive :(<//Text>

Have visited a couple times here and once in Santa Barbara. Service is gererally quick and pleasant. One you order and can find a table just wait for your pager to go off. That's the cue to pickup you order and grub down. The burgers are tasty. Always cooked perfectly. Not greasy and with good portions of meat, cheese and rabbit-food. The fries are also pretty darn good too. They seem to always be somewhat to very busy so plan accordingly. Location is good and parking is ok.<//review>

Great service, good food, good onion rings. Picturesque location. Right across the street from a T-Mobile store. The T-Mobile store had a window ad that said four lines for $25 - made me think that it would be a great line for a drug dealer. On a serious note, great place for burgers.< /review>

Have you ever seen a long line at a hambergur place?  Well in and out but this place is way WAYYYYYY better.  Even the salad looks amazing.  All the food was good!  My picky daughter is in love with it and the drinks are so amamxing!  I’m addicted to the cucumber and citrus drink.  All the Tea’s are so good too.  The strawberry limeade is my hubbys favorite.  Plus they have vitamin water and Powerade this is perfect for us!< /text>

<text>Always yummy burgers, crispy fries, really nice selection of drinks - soda, ice teas, lemonade. Decent Grilled cheese & garden burger for non-carnivore types! Peppers & condiments bar, too. This location has a great outdoor seating area with fireplace. Employees are friendly & efficient - unusual for fast food!
Update 7-14-17  Ordered a grilled Cheese kid's meal for my daughter. Sandwich was fine but very small portion of sweet potatoes is ridiculous! Hoping management reads these reviews & does something about the very small portions - 5 regular sized fries is inadequate for a 10 year old!</text>< Pictures>

The Habit is always the best place to get butgers. Me and my grandmother had a good time here. Burger was nice and vegetables were fress. The sweet potato fries needed a bit more salt but other than that it was a great meal. Service was fast.< /review>

<Name>Nestor Finney< /Name><Review>I've been here many times and I've never been disappointed. The burgers and fries are great and I can't believe the reasonable prices. A hamburger combo meal is cheaper than many combo meals at a fast food restaurant. My only complaint is that there is often a long line whenever I visit the place.< /Review>< user_id>

<Review>The location is very near to the cinema theatres in Fremont. The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food and the atmosphere is vegetarian friendly too. The order doesn’t take much time and I recommend this if you are a fan of custom-built burgers.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Curbside pickup is apparently not at the curb. I described my car, as well as where I was parked. After waiting nearly 10 minutes, I went in to find they only looked for me in parking lot behind the restaurant. Wish there was some indication on ordering site. Cherry on top is that my order was missing food.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>My favorite burger place! The Santa Barbara style, grilled sourdough is delicious. The fries are good and so are the milkshakes.  The beverages are self serve. There's outdoor seating. It can be busy during lunch time, but the line goes pretty quick. Unfortunately, when it is so busy, there isn't enough seating.  They have kids meals. Parking is easier to find behind the building and walking a little way.<//text>< Pictures>

Update: Customer Service was prompt and friendly in making up for their mistake. Will definitely be giving them another try.

Burger was good, but ordered a double without pickles and got a single with pickles.< /Review>

Great flavor char burger. Quick service even with a wait in line to order.  Having the caramelized onions sweeten the taste. Fresh lettuce and tomato. With a bun that holds up under such a juicy burger. Fresh hot french fried potatoes. I love the strawberry limeade.  Next time try the deep fried green beans as alternative to French fries!</text>

<Text>Lovely burger! Fries were a little overdone but I can live with that. Loved the little extras like the jalapenos etc. Staff were super friendly which is always a plus. 9/10 (due to fries) but giving 5/5 anyway, 'cos I'm good like that.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Great burger, very flavorful!  Fries were crispy and delicious as well!  Downside:  the burger completely fell apart after two bites, and I had to was my hands afterwards, but that's a small price to pay for a great burger.<//review>

It's a really good char grilled burger. High quality meat and dressing. Refreshing aguas frescas. Hot fries. Free chiles. I wish they used leaf lettuce because the chopped lettuce falls out too easily. And the onion rings are good but not very juicy - a little on the dry side.

They're a good taste because of the char grilled flavor but they could be better. I go regularly despite my criticisms.< /text>

I love their mushroom char and club sandwich. They are filling and tasty, without leaving you with a heavy tummy. You can swap a side of french fries with green bean tempura! I love their pacific commons location, the staff is friendly and the service is fast. Great joint for getting a quick bite between meetings or during lunch!<//Text>< pics>

<review>My children reminded me that we have eaten at a Habit burger joint before.  Their burgers are better than In-N-Out, Fuddruckers, McDonalds, Burger King, Jack-in-the-box, Carl's Jr and Giant Burgers.  Onion rings, potato fries, and fried snap peas were so delightful that the only thing missing is fried Okra which you can only find at Church's Fried Chicken.  Anyway, food is good and quite affordable.  Place is clean and workers are nice unless they are trying to close up shop for the day.  There are so many burger joints now that choices seem endless.  However, if you want a good relatively fast prepared burger, come to Habit Burger.  Try it, for eventually, it might become a habitual visit.<//review>< Pictures>

Quick, ordered online, ready before promised. They used to have an option for how you want it cooked, but now you can only request well done. In afraid to see what that looks like because mine was already extra well done. Would be nice if they cooked them medium.</Text>

<Text>It's okay, In-N-Out is way better though. The line here is always so long it's going out the door, it seems like it takes forever just to order. There's barely any seating indoors so you'll likely end up outside in the cold.They do have outdoor heaters but they're not always turned on. The burger is okay, if you ask me it doesn't taste like beef, has a more sour taste like pork. The fries are alright, but I suggest the sweet potato fries instead of regular, they traste better. Service is pretty slow.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place has notably better burgers than In-n-Out, but they are not built to go. The burger gets way too soggy if you leave it be for 5 minutes.

Milk shakes here also come with malt, so that's a plus given the competition.

Also, the heaters make sitting outside on a slightly chilly night somewhat reasonable.<//text>< pics>

*they changed the mushroom char to portobello char which is not quite the same!
*their double double is just normal burger not option of making anything on the menu 2 patty, so what ever changes you make, considered as add-on.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
The burgers are charred to perfection...tastes like Mesquite, but it isn't.  The lettuce wrap is the best execution: multiple layers of firm Iceberg Lettuce hold even the messy bits in place almost as well as a bun.  So much better than any other burger joint, although only slightly better than Five Guys.</Review>

Not my favorite place.  Seating is crammed, ordering is inpersonable and expensive for what you actually.  For $20, I get a better sandwich elsewhere.  And it's not like it's a huge quantity and it feels like they're not running AC inside.  They do have outside seating, that's sometime shaded, and it's the only good thing about the site.< /text>

This is for the green bean tempura. So delicious, crispy and less oily compared to the tempura we had in Japanese restaurant. However it's tiny portion . The burger was great, juicy and tender. Will be back for the green bean tempura soon.<//Review>

I tried this place because they were offering a free burger if you signed up on their email list. The burger was okay, it wouldn't be my first choice to go to when I'm craving. It's char broiled, not really my preference, but for what it is, they make it well. I like the all you can use condiments bar. The staff was friendly and helpful. My daughter dopped her burger and they replaced it without issue. The location is great, there's a theater and shopping areas. I, personally would choose another place over the Habit but if you want a burger, they don't  disappoint.</text>

Yummy and well priced. Staff very friendly and had a good vibe. I ate the ahi on wheat and the sirachi greenbeans. Would get five stars but drink options could be beter, ice dispenser was jammed, and seating is tough to come by.<//review>

<Text>For Locals, this is one of the most popular fast food in the area.
For Tourists, this is burger you don't want to missed before you leave CA.
I recommend Tri-Tip Steak on sourdough bread.< /Text>< user>

Tiny meat patty. I asked the cashier if it was a quarter pounder and she said yes, so I didn't order fries...but it was the same size patty as in-n-out. Still hungry.</review>

Terrible experience.  The onion rings were over salted and the fries had none.  The double burger was nothing special.  The place itself is undersized for the amount of people crammed in fighting for seats and placing orders.  The teriyaki sandwich was still mooing and under seasoned.  Worse meal in CA</text>

Pretty similar to In-n-Out, I think.  One big plus if you have an EV is that there's a ChargePoint charger in the Target parking lot at the back, currently free for the 1st hour (then $2/hr afterward, presumably to force turnover).</Text>

Very tasty burgers and reasonably priced. Better than In-N-Out. At Habit, the shakes are delicious too.</review>

Really negative experiennce today. I was with a party of three and had to leave a table for four for a party of one. He complained so the cashier threatened me. I went ahead and moved to another table for four that openned up. More training is needed for what looked be a new employee. This was the most poorly managed Habit I have been to.<//Review>

Veggie burger and fries are pretty tasty! This location gets fairly busy during the work week lunch hour, although getting there around 11:45am instead of 12:00pm seems to make a big difference!</text>

I actually really love The Habit. I never usually eat it though, but the burgers and their side caesar salads are really good. I really love how they hand out buzzers while you're waiting because it just makes life so much easier than calling out a name.<//text>

Panhandlers were in the Fremont, CA restaurant going table to table begging for money with children.  A complete Scam. Management was advised and did nothing about this situation.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Leaving San Francisco at night, be sure to come to this Habit Burger with friends and family for a Burger 下午
In addition to ordering a signature big burger, I also ordered a chicken sandwich on sale.
After taking a bite, how can you make a delicious Namo! 😋
Shove

晚上即將離開舊金山，下午一定要來這家親友力推的Habit Burger吃個Burger 🍔
除了點了個招牌大漢堡之外，又點了個在正在促銷的鷄肉三明治。
吃了一口以後，怎麼拿摩好吃！😋
大推👍👍👍</text>
