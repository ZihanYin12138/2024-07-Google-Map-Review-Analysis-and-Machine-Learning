I've been here two times in two years to get both of my cars taken care of, and the service is always excellent. My cars came out looking great. Great paint job and great service! Ask for Peter... he'll take good care of you.< /Review>

This auto shop charged me $125.00 for a diagnostic check even though I gave my business to them.

He did the diagnosis and I agreed to have him repair my car. About a week later, my car is having the same issue he said he fixed.

I brought the car to him again and he wanted to charge me another $125.00 for the diagnostic..I refused. He did the diagnostic at no charge this time and he told me my engine is going bad and that it would cost me $5600 to have the engine replaced. I drive a 2011. Here's what I gathered:

1. Dishonesty practices
2. Price gouging
3. Poor time management
4. Poor communication

Stay away..!!</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1614198605478, 'text': "Here at A-One Auto Center, we value all feedback to ensure we continue to meet our customers' needs.

<review>Peter was amazing! He took my vehicle without an appointment on a very busy day just to help me out. Although I only needed a battery replacement Peter discovered the dealer had given me a battery that does not power turbo engine cars. Peter was able to talk the warranty company into giving me the right battery free of charge! I will refer my friends and family to Peter and A-One Auto Center!< /review><user_id>115479755215234258475<//user_id></record>

I absolutely had to leave a review for this shop. I had recently purchased a car and for some reason it wouldn't start. I had to get it jumped etc so I was overly fraustrated.  The dealer kept referring me to Pep Boys who were highly overwhelmed and could not even get me in to do a diagnostic. Since the car was still under warranty I searched the website until I could find a shop that could assist me. Well I found this one and Eddy and his staff went above and beyond to service my car!!! No 6 hour eta, very courteous service and very fast!! Nice office area with refreshments and a tv. My car was checked and come to find out I needed a new battery!!! Eddy ordered a good battery it was sent down and I was on my way!!! I will be back for any additional services such as oil changes etc. Great customer service is everything to me and they nailed it!!!<//text>

Great great service, good prices. Really make you feel taken care of! I wouldn't take my car any where else! Highly recommend!
This was written before I found out their work was actually very shoddy. I would not recommend them to anyone, and highly regret ever doing so.< /review>

Took a while to find problem and parts and labor very expensive! Autozone parts were extremely less expensive at 193.00 for throttle body assy and 81.00 for Egr valve if bought,so the remaining 1200.00 was Way to much for this job and very unhappy about it< /Text>

No experience with the actual work they do, but the guy who answered the phone had an ill manner of addressing things. Sounded like he has trouble communicating effectively in english too, I had to repeat myself slowly a few times. Based off that, it could be a deal breaker for some people but for myself I would like every interaction and process with a business to be pleasant.<//review>

They charge to diagnose and do not apply the $105 to your bill.  We took our vehicle here for a leak and when we picked it up, it still was leaking.  They quoted us hundreds more to fix the "leak" but we declined.  We found a reputable shop through AAA that fixed the leak for a fraction of the estimate.<//review>

<review>I brought my 04 f350 to this place because it had good reviews. They do not live up to there reviews. They had my truck for a week and didnt touch it while i was on vacation. The manager went on vacation same time i did but didnt communicate with anyone what work needed to be done on it. I came back from vacation. Had to rent a truck to go back to work as they let it sit for another couple days and finally they fixed it in a day. I came to pickup the truck up and after looking over some parts i noticed there was a part missing,  another one loose and another part not on properly. Another day goes by....Bottom line they had my truck 2.5 weeks. 3 of those days actually worked on it. I had to pay full price and for the rental truck for all those days. Would never reccomend this place.</review><user_name>Dieselmxtt</user_name><user>100146907612333223862< /user><gmap_id>0x80c2b578478945f1:0x395c84b775bc6a35< /gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

<Date>1602697604427< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>My iPhone 11 had a crack in the screen like most phones. I had to get it fixed because it would keep glitching every time I turned it on. So I go get it fixed at this shop. The screen looks good however my phone is a lot worse now. The screen always blacks out whenever I’m receiving a call and I can’t even answer. I have to double click my power button and cal the person back. They didn’t put my phone back together properly at all. I do not recommend this place at all. Horrible repair but I guess that’s what you get with a low price. You get what you pay for.< /text>< Pictures>

Really impressed with the communication and work by this company. I sent them an email asking the price and availability. Then, I found a 2nd company who had an automatic quote and set an appointment online! I was stoked but after I did that, I already had an email from Bubble Screen telling me the price (which was $40 cheaper!) and that they were open that day. Great communication. When we went in, he was wearing mask, he set up text notifications, and replaced the XR screen in ten minutes. Will definitely return here if I have a future problem.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Knowledgeable and friendly staff take great care in repairing your device. They just replaced a fault power button on my galaxy s3. They got it done quickly without an appointment and for less than what other places quoted. This shop repairs many types of devices and will give you a quick quote over the phone.<//review>< GmapID>

If you're reading this and need a screen repaired, look no further. I have an ipad for business purposes that was dropped by an employee. Not only was their quoted price the best I found- they called me for pickup not more than 30 minutes later.

Very friendly service and will definitely be using in the future and recommending.<//Review>

<Date>1483031846711< /Date><rate>5</rate><Review>Amazing service and staff. My phone parts had to be ordered but were in store not even a full 24 hours later, so I went back and they told me my phone would be done in an hour and it was. It looks amazing. They also replaced the border which was horribly chipped, my phone looks brand new. Oh, and they even added tempered glass and told me if the very few small bubbles didn't go away in two days they would replace that, but they were gone not even 12 hours later. My LG phone is not like others and the headphone jack isn't as protected, that was also damaged but they will have the part in 48 hours or less and for free, they were extremely apologetic over this, which I saw no need for but just another thing that proves their customer service. I never write reviews but this place was simply amazing.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd602beedf5b7:0x30727ce02846cd82<//gmap_id></record>

<review>I needed fingerprints done ASAP and am so glad I chose this business. Fast service, no wait, and straight forward! I had emailed them asking if their rates were comparable to SDCOE and the boss said he would honor the SDCOE price for me as a teacher. Was not expecting such a kind response! 100% recommend this company and I will be using them again in the future!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1595556992560, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the kind words!

I had a quick, pleasant time here getting a Fingerprint Livescan for work/school reasons. He was very professional and kind and even gave a restaurant recommendation as I went around lunch time. 5/5 - Would come back if I needed to get another Livescan for a future job!</review>

<review>I have been going to this park since I was a child and now I go with my children. It has plenty of things to do for the kids and the area that the ancient oak tree stood still has a unique spot in the grass for the kids to see.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Was here for my child's soccer game. The park is small, but it has 2 soccer fields and a playground. It has many trees around to provide generous amounts of shade and you can see folks walking their dogs. The park is hidden in the neighborhood so it took lots of turns to finally find it. I did notice that the neighborhood folks were extremely friendly😊.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Okay park. Take my kids here often because of location.

Kinda weird how the kindergarten teachers at MLK school are allowed to take the students off the schools premises to play at this park. I mention this because they food the park and run others off with minimal help from teachers. If my kids went to MLK, id be worried< /text>

Very bad customer service! The lady was very very rude every time,  the man was tolerable but now he is rude as well, the flowers are pretty but won’t last long 1week they are dead,  you are better off buying a pretty base and going to food for less for flowers! Not waisting my money here any more!<//text>

<text>Had the pleasure of walking in this glower shop this morning and was very impressed of how accommodating the owner was! He helped me create an arrangement for my mom at my liking at a very fast pace. I bought two arrangements and was very happy with the quality.. I’ll be back soon :)</text>< Pictures>

Ordered a large flower arrangement for a funeral, the yellow Rose's were absolutely beautiful.  Miguel and his son were very helpful.  Also they have several beautiful bouquets already to go for $10. 00 each and they are lovely and not skimpy bouquets.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The flowers are beautiful, but the lady who attends whenever we come is in a very bad mood.
Almost fanned out makes the flowers, no customer service so prepare to put up with his bad mood I don't know how flowers survive.

I’m learning it really depends on who you get to do your nails! I’ve been here twice now, after my first visit, my nails lasted a whole 5 weeks without any issues other than the new growth that comes with not getting your nails done for 5 weeks. My 2nd time, different story. I had a different girl do my nails, she looked irritated and in a rush because she wasn’t even done with my nails before moving onto the next person. The girl doing my pedi had to apply the final coat and finish up my hands. I also had to come back a few days later to have a nail fixed because it cracked. I’ve also had to file my nails since then (it’s been a week now) because my nails are lifting and snagging on things.< /review>

5 stars for the quality of the job done, they really did a beautiful job, but giving a 3 because all I had was a fill but they told me they charge $10 extra for shaping the nails....really? Since when is shaping the nails not included in getting your nails done? It was just a square tip. So yes, excellent job but be prepared to be overcharged for something that's included everywhere else.< /text>

My daughter and I came in from out of town to get our nails done my daughter got a new set her nails turned out fine. I requested to have a fill was told to have a design I would need to take my nails off and my options would be to RIP!! them off or soak them off witch would cost me extra cuz it would take him more time?? Are u kidding me??? What kinda nail chop shop is this I'm sorry I asked u to do ur job correctly and I thought I was paying u for that already not for u to rip my dam nails off I can do that my self. They act like they hate there jobs. They acted like they needed to rip my nails off cuz they didn't have time. I just had him fix my broken nail I wasn't gonna let him ruin my nails.  Then the nail shop sat empty for the next 11/2 while I waited for my daughter.< /review>

Venmo, Cash App or Visa.\n\nDaily we receives deposit for appointment from clients using Visa over the phone, Venmo, or Cash App.'}</Response>< Review>
This used to be my absolute favorite nail salon and I have recommended it to many friends but I tried to call in today to make an appointment for a fill as I was just in there two weeks ago to get the set I have on and they started asking me for my debit card Information over the phone and told me I can’t make an appointment without giving them that information. Now Everyone in the world is told not to give that info over the phone so why would I do that for a simple nail fill when I’ve never heard of that in my whole 10 years of getting my nails done. That’s a violation of my privacy and sounds like a giant scam to me. Sad to say I will never be going here again as the nail techs were all friendly and did a good job but not worth losing my life savings over somebody stealing my card info! I’ve NEVER heard of paying a deposit to get your nails done. And asking for my card info over the phone is UNPROFESSIONAL. You can respond back to my reply all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that you taking my card info and writing it down somewhere to be found by possibly anyone is not professional nor is it safe! There’s other salons nearby that can do the same work without these “new policies” and I bet they actually wear their masks too... do better, not only for yourself but for your community because after all we’re the ones keeping you in business.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>It’s a chop shop. The owner refuses to wear a mask. It’s literally sitting on his arm. I’ve reported them to the county and state and will not be returning. If he doesn’t care about basic health standards when we I see him, I doubt he’s following other health and safety protocols. Find another place- this one isn’t safe.</Review>< Pictures>

They took their time to make sure our manicures and pedicures looked nice (which lasted a long time). The lighting, serenity music, the smell, and the chairs make it so relaxing. Feels like you're at a day spa.

Most salons are busy, loud, rushing people in and out. So far nothing compares to this place. Everyone should at least try it once.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< time>

Beautiful band new salon and amazing customer service! Separate pedicure room with wonderful massaging chairs. I followed Tiffany (the owner) from another salon and I'm happy to support her new business! They have a large selection of colors and chemical free, VEGAN, cruelty free choices too! Top notch service!< /Review>

She was very attentive to my needs and asked specifically what I wanted . She was sure to check and make sure I was happy with length and shape and color throughout the service. Very friendly and meticulous. 10/10 service, would recommend.<//review>< pics>

Jenny, girl, my nails are the best. Attention to detail is a 10! Best nail salon I've EVER been to in my 33 years on the Earth! Everyone needs to go here! Especially, if you're  OCD about symmetry like me. She's got you. GO.< /Text>

Ahhhh....what a great pedicure experience!  My husband and I went together and both had very attentive, precise, friendly and high quality nail technicians.  The chairs....oh my....it's like having a full massage and pedicure all in one.  We went for the non-toxic/organic aspect and it far exceeded our expectations.  We will definitely be back!  NOTE:  Name has changed to VP DELUXE</Review>

<review>One of the BEST places for a lasting and beautiful pedicure using natural products (always a plus in my book) - no chemical toxic smells here. The polish lasted since the time we were here - almost 4 months ago! I look forward to coming here every time I visit from the bay. She makes her own sugar scrub, blends essential oils, carries less-toxic nail polish, making this place perfect for pregnant mamas too. The finale? While your toes dry you get to lay back in a full body massage chair. Simply the best!<//review>< pictures>

Berrys in my sandwich? It was actually really good! A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. You have a choice of salad or chips with the sandwich. Salad is fine if you're into Roman lettuce.... Ice berg, please.< /Text>

I asked for the avocado toast, it came with egg on top of the toast and I requested for no egg. The chef scraped the egg out of the toast and gave me the same one. The bread was not toasted well, the avocado n pesto was not spread well, it was lumpy and uneven. There was no salt, no cilantro, no pickles. It was just plain. I paid $9 for this!!!! I had high expectations for boudin, no more.< /text>

I ordered 7 sandwhiches and we received 6 sandwhiches and ONE BOX WITH TWO SLICES OF BACON. This was my first and the LAST time I am EVER getting food from here. AND OF COURSE I'M THE ONE WHO DIDNT GET THEIR FOOD!! I could have easily gotten a much better experience at the most run down Mc Donald's in town. With service this bad it shouldn't be anywhere near Santana row and instead moved over to the east side of San Jose where the service is expected to be this awful. In the end I paid 12 bucks for a sandwhich I never received. My friend ordered the grate with crispy bacon and received a box with two slices of HARDLY crispy bacon and the wrong sandwhich altogether. SHAMEFUL<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Small shop in a mall setting, but it offers full service like other Boudin locations. I ordered the last round, three of the long loaves, two fish shape small buns, the last turtle shape, some shamrock cookies, and half a dozen mini buns. They travel to Michigan in prefect shape, but be sure to tell the attendant you want the bread to travel, so that they place it in plastic bags. Everything was delicious, and the service was cordial.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fcb1f954cec81:0x62852e670b0036c1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I am a fan of the brand but this place just did not have it.  Service was extremely slow.  Food was very so so here and breads were not fresh or good.  I would like to say that the staff was polite and used and changed gloves every time needed while I was there waiting.<//Review>

<Review>Greg was super helpful and patient with all my questions on a new bike. The service was quick and easy. Also a great relaxed atmosphere with friendly employees who love cycling - really made me feel comfortable and made me feel like I was getting honest and real advice on service and gear instead of being upsold by a salesman. Best shop I’ve visited in La, highly recommend!< /Review></record>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I am in LOVE!! I stopped by a few days ago to check out the store and prices. Seth was patient and helpful.

Today I went back with my daughter to buy a bike for her. Greg was helping us. Again, super helpful and patient. Turns out they don't have the exact bike my daughter wants (but they'll call us when it arrives). So we got a new seat for her current bike (as a place holder).

Oh, and while we were there... i finally bit the bullet to figure out what bike is best for me.... a townie. A beautiful olive green townie. I went for a ride as soon as I got home. I haven't ridden a bike in 15 years or more. All I can say is I am in LOVE!!

Beautiful bike, great service. Looking forward to getting my daughter her bike soon 💜

Updated to say: I’ve been in here many times now. Every time, great service. It doesn’t matter if I’m alone, with one kid, or both. I highly recommend Helen’s cycles 😊<//Review>< Gmap_id>

The supply shortages of 2020 has hurt everyone but Helen's still has some of the finest road and MTB bike inventory! Check them out! Just look at this beautiful 2019 Cannondale SystemSix ULT at the Manhattan Beach store!< /Text>

The Store had a very wide selection of bycicles and accessories, I was allowed to test drive the bycicle, and the employee was very very helpful and clearly knowledgeable about bycicles, and helped me pick out accessories and such for my bycicle, helped us understand how to use it, and was very kind and helpful in explaining everything, as well as the process of insuring the bycicle and the process of using that insurance in other places. If I need a bike or repair I will definitely go to Helen's.< /review>

Passion from employees to help you get the right product.

Helen's in Manhattan Beach have been extremely helpful and patient despite extremely heavy business during the pandemic. They aren't in a hurry to get you out the door or peddle whatever is in stock.

I worked mainly with Seth, and he has gone above and beyond any expectations to provide service. His passion for cycling and those of the other employees was obvious.

If there's any doubt that you're not sure what you need and are new to cycling, Helen's will help you find what you need, whether that's budget, activity, or accessory.

I have been throughly impressed.</review>

<Text>Again, the point has been missed. What would have been best in this scenario is if I had been respected as a customer. I was not informed about the back room and I immediately left when told I was not allowed.

Please hold a customer service training for Sales Manager Greg, so he will be more equipped to treat customers kindly, and with more professionalism in the future. I would hate for anyone to have  a degrading experience like this imposed by Sales Manager Greg. He put me in a corner with a strict 10 minute timer to charge my phone in order to get an Uber XL so I could get my two bikes out of there, I was sitting on the ground like a child in time out after spending over $150.

I would recommend everyone reading this to go to REI which has great customer service and is cheaper.

I am an original customer of Helen's Cycles in Marina del Rey and Santa Monica. I recently moved to a new neighborhood in Manhattan Beach and was in need of tubes and tires for my road bikes. I was stoked to take it to Helen's Cycles as I've had a pleasant experience with this bike shop before.

I really wish I could give a stellar review for my first visit to Helen's Cycles in Manhattan Beach, but unfortunately I found myself in an unprofessional situation. As I was finishing up with the helpful service staff, my phone died as I was ordering an uber to pick me and my bikes up.

A sales associate kindly placed my phone on a charger right by the counter. When I retrieved my phone, I was immediately accosted by Sales Manager Greg.

I felt confused, embarrassed and extremely uncomfortable when I was told that I could not reach for my phone and then was taken to a corner of the store to charge it with a strict 10 minute time limit. When I responded to this erratic behavior, I was told to calm down.

As a customer of Helen's, I felt extremely disappointed by the unfair treatment. This is 2020, our phones will need charging sometimes in a store and a customer will come unprepared and needing assistance. It would've been really kind to have been assisted with such a small request so I could get my bikes and myself back home to a biking trip I was schedule to attend that day.

Furthermore, I was looking forward to continue investing money into Helen's Cycles- with plans to do further upgrades and servicing with the Manhattan location-- however, this extremely unprofessional occurrence has unfortunately turned me off from ever returning.

As a business person, I take pride in treating my customers with the utmost care and respect, even if it's outside of my scope, I would not hesitate to accommodate.</Text>< pics>

Fantastic!  I ordered a bike rack for the back.  Due to covid I was delayed getting back to pick it up.  Long story short, today they had the rack.  Seth put it on for me, helped me get a cool new style lock like the u shape one, but better and put it in my little car.  Thanks.</Text>

Don't bother bringing bike in for service during the shutdown you'll be on line for hours to drop off and to pick up and let people they know cut the line, they should take all service from the back door instead having people they know sneak around back. Had to bring the bike to another shop because the repair failed 3 hours after we received it and they said they used the wrong size tube in the tire.  Good luck< /text>

I came here with my daughter for a helmet and a bike in an attempt to buy local instead of a big chain. Walked around 10 min and no one offered to help. Asked an employee for help and he said he was busy even though he was literally just standing around. Asked someone else else to help and he was "busy" as well. So we left. I guess they reserve their customer service for guys who look like they may drop 6 grand on a bike.

Side note: my husband, a white male, has never had this issue when he goes there alone

My advice to the company would be to keep in mind that your favored demographic may have wives and children. It's good business to treat everyone with respect.</review>

I went here once when I was looking to get a mountain bike, the service is horrible. The staff is not friendly or helpful at all. When I went in I tried getting someone to help me but I just got the silent treatment. My brother got the same experience when he went. I would never recommend this place to anyone. You're much better off going to the Helen's cycle in Santa Monica the staff is actually helpful. I got my mountain bike from the Helen's cycle in Santa Monica and I love it.</Text>

Very friendly, clear and kind advice by Jim!My wife and I bought great two bikes and enough starter equipment with reasonable price by his excellent guidance. I came from Japan just one year before by company assignment. So my English skill and vocabulary on bike is not enough. However he kindly explain to me and my wife till we understand. I do recommend the store if my friends start cycling or looking for Trek bike!
Many thanks,Jun< /Review>

Seth is the bomb! He was super informative, helpful, and so approachable. He even made sure I had all the info I needed to do some research on the bikes I had ridden, but I ended up coming back that evening to purchase my new Trek. It was quick and painless and one of the best bike shop experiences I’ve had. I also love that I get to bring the bike back in for a year of service! Helen’s offers a great deal/value on their bikes. 10/10 recommending this shop to all my friends and fellow cyclists.< /review>

My own esperience is nothing but good feelings, the staff us friendly and helpful the mechanics are great, especially "Edgar", in general is one of the best cycling stores is you're serious about this sport they have the top of the line products with competitive pricing and if they don't have it in stuck, they can get them for you sooner than any other web site. Two thumbs up! 👍🏼👍🏼😀🚴‍♂️😎<//Review>

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they can talk about the synthetic materials and how that can affect the bike's ride. The staff is relatively young, don't be surprised if you see a teen with braces trying to convince you to buy the latest hybrid bike. They allow you to enjoy a practice ride with the bike before purchase and usually they give you a couple bonus items with any purchase of a bike. I would recommend this for people who are looking at a bike as an investment, because some of the road bikes can range upwards of $500+.<//review>

My rear shifter cable snapped on my Trek Domane 5.2 after about 6000 miles of riding.  I also took the bike in for a full clean and tuneup with their ultra clean package.  I also had them install new cables for both shifters and brakes, Duo trap sensor, seat, cable housing, and new bar tape.  I must say that the customer service and attention to detail the mechanic Marshall was above and beyond what I would expect from a normal bike shop.  The bike feels and looks like new and the new yellow bar tape they installed looks great!  The work was performed on time per the appointment and I received my bike back immediately!  Thanks Marshall!  Will always use Helen's Cycles in the future for all bike needs!  I do wish that the Manhattan location had a wider selection of shoes and helmets.  The Santa Monica store is larger, but is further away.  Not faulting them on this since the store is smaller.  Reason I mention this is at the time I made the service appointment, the yellow bar tape and Jagwire yellow cable kit was not available in the store and I had to order separately from other bike shops.</text>

<Text>If you tend to think Cosco is a good place to buy a bike, this is not the shop for you.  But if you want something more durable and will last, Helen's has the gear.  Great selection of the top bike brands and experts and setup and repairs.  Not the cheapest place around but the only place I trust my bikes to.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>I just got ripped off at Helen Cycles. I dropped my bike off to get my rear wheel trued up and the front and rear derailleur adjusted, ok great. The tech said, "Hey your breaks are a little worn and i have been using these break pads and they have been great, do you want to try them?"

He handed them to me and I said, "Yeah it is about time I'll get them" and started to walk toward the the check out to buy them.

He stopped me and said, "I'll put them on for you."

It being a 60 second job, I thought oh, that's nice and said, "Ah, thanks." and handed back the break pads to him.

When I picked up my bike today, not only did they charge me for a job that took them less than a minute, they charged me $30! When I went to speak to the service guy about it he couldn't even look me in eye and just kept muttering, I don't set the prices, sorry.

There prices are high, fine, I get it they are in MB, I had no problem paying $20 for the wheel true and $28 for the F&R derailleur adjustment, but the $30 for the breaks a nothing job is ridiculous, especially when you make it sound like your are going to just do it as a throw in since I was spending $300.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I had an incredible experience at Helen's cycles. I had just come from a very unsatisfactory visit at REI and decided to go to Helen's for assistance. I was helped by Edgar, a wonderful employee who fixed my bike up right away. Edgar was truly wonderful to me, especially after having such a frustrating time at REI. I really appreciate the atmosphere at Helen's cycles and all of the employees were kind and incredibly helpful. I hope the manager recognizes Edgar for his great costumer service and technical skills. Thank you Helen's Cycles for making my visit so great!</Text>< gmapID>

Called them about renting a mountain bike and they said Jeff was the person to speak with, but he wasn't around yet. They took down my name and number to have him call me when they came in. Never heard back so I called again and then he was at lunch. I asked if I could just rent a mountain bike and talk to someone else, but again they insisted I had to speak with Jeff. Day ended and still no word from him.
Went to Hermosa Cyclery, Inc instead and had an awesome experience and they spent a ton of time with me showing the best places to go. Go give your business to them, instead.<//text>

Was helped promptly. The money burning a hole in my pocket was promptly emptied into the helen's coffers. Got a nice discount on top of the sale price on my new ride, a discount on a rack, and they even gave me a free kickstand.</Review>

<review>At nearly 900 acres, Livermore’s Grove Regional Park is one of the city’s largest recreation spaces.

The park is located on Wetmore Road and offers outdoorsy visitors an array of recreation options, including biking, walking, running, and horseback riding.

One of the park’s centerpieces is the 2 ½-mile paved trail that winds through several natural environments. There’s also a much shorter loop trail that’s an excellent option for those traveling with little ones.

From the park’s trails, it’s common to see a variety of wildlife species. There’s also a picnic area featuring covered seating and restrooms, just a stone’s throw from the parking area.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyy06AC3ISA0aunQMmOqC74eQlcH2m3iDQlhy7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

It's a nice park, tucked away from the street.   It's a decent place to photograph families. The playground is fun for the kids.<//text>

We always go there when the Hawaiian Ho'olaulea (Festival) happens in June.  The valley area is perfect for families and friends.  The park organization sets up things to make and take... including the famous walking stick.  Highly recommend.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Dirk and his team at T&T Liberty Safes are the best! One of the biggest and most beautiful showrooms in the Nation. Customer service is top notch. They've helped us out numerous times and our customers had nothing but Positive Feedback. We highly recommend T&T Liberty Safes to anyone looking for a safe in Southern and Central California.
Thank you,
The Safe Keeper Team< /review>

They sold me my gun safe back in 2013 with the pge power grid shut down that happened last night on my street. I went there to buy a safe light for the gun safe door so i could see the numbers in the dark when i have to dial the combination to open the safe.</text>

T&T safe has a great selection of quality safes such as the best Fort Knox safes and others they have from New to used safes for sale.  All sizes and shapes and very old fashioned types of safes.  If they can't get it it isn't made yet.</text>

I recently purchased a 12 gun safe organizer that unfortunately came without the hardware to mount the organizer to the door panel. Debra from T and T Liberty Safe was excellent. I'd give this business a 10 stars if I could. She listened to my issue, understood the problem, and resolved my issue in a timely manner. Instead of having Liberty ship me all the hardware to properly mount the organizer, she is having them ship me a whole new organizer. Thank you Debra for all that you've done, it is greatly appreciated.<//review>

<Review>T&T Safes rocks!! This place is the only place in Bakersfield to buy a safe. Between family we own 7 Liberty safes. All of them amazing, 1 not purchased from T&T safes. They have an amazing show room that will make you drool even if you don't really care about safes or guns. After walking thru, you'll want one. They have amazing customer service and have managed 3 issues for the family. Just recently I had an issue with a small hand gun quick vault. Rather than giving me the run around with corporate, they simply did some quick troubleshooting (ie. Check the battery). No obvious fix, so they grabbed a new one and handed it to me, at no cost. They stand behind their product and don't give you any headaches. Absolutely will recommend to everyone. They also rent safe jacks, and moving services.</Review>< gmapID>

<text>I bought a Liberty Safe from this company (for my home) almost 20 years ago, and recently decided to upgrade to a larger safe. The showroom had many models to choose from and the sales reps. are very knowledgeable. It was a pleasure to deal with a local company that has been in business for so many years. Service was excellent and I highly recommend Liberty safes - made in the USA!</text><date>1495211115236</date></record>

< Review>
T & T Liberty Safe is a quality, reputable, knowledgeable and friendly business in my town (and other locations). My wife and I recently purchased a Fatboy Jr safe during their "no tax sale". They held it until I was ready for delivery. I called for delivery and they came out the next day! That is probably not typical, but it worked for me. The delivery/install guys were prompt, courteous and quick- in and out less than 1 hour including bolting it down. It fit perfectly in a closet with room to hide it behind doors or a curtain. They set up the interior lights and our password/combinations. The safe is a really cool dark green marble exterior with a clean interior including fully adjustable shelves. All smoothed out, for less than $2k we have a fantastic safe for fire protection/security for weapons and valuables. T & T is recommended for a fine dining experience (LOL)!</Review>

I am very grateful! I also want to say he has a Great Assistant Angie!
And as a matter of fact the whole office staff is Great!
Thanks Liz, Mayra and Sandra
I love my Western Dental @ 5200 Stockton Blvd. Sacramento CA!</text>< Pics>

Thank you so much to Hilda and Leslie! Hilda was amazing at explaining everything as she did the cleaning and made me feel super comfortable as she explained what she was doing with the tools as she was cleaning. They both were very kind and super quick! The staff was very friendly and provided me with A LOT of information. If you do stop by at this dentistry ask for Hilda she will take good care of you!</Text>

< Review>
Absolutely love the service at  Dental.  They have the best staff!   Ms. Ebony took care of all my questions and concerns from the minute I walked in.  I was super nervous because I hate having dental work done.  But after meeting with Ms. Ebony, I felt more at ease and comfortable with taking the next steps.  Ms. Ebony is great at what she does, it’s a tough job to get me to sit still in a dentist office.  If you have any questions or fears, ask for Ebony!!!  I appreciate the great hospitality.  Overall, customer experience was excellent!   Not to mention, the prices and payment plans are super reasonable.   Thank you so much Brident team!  You are appreciated!!!</Review>

Leslie was awesome helping me with finance options so I was able to get the treatment I needed. Dr. Marshall was amazing! She made the experience comfortable & had a fun sense of humor. Thea the dental assistant was so kind and professional. No one likes going to the dentist, but these wonderful people made my experience a very good one!!!! Thank you all!!!! 😊💗<//Text>< Rate>

I've had two visits so far for dental work and it's the first time in my life that I had such a pain-free experience like this. Dr. Arora is a very skilled professional. I feel that I am in good hands being treated by her. And she explains everything she is doing and puts it in simple terms. I really appreciate being able to get her as my new dentist.<//review>

Dr Patel managed to fit me into her schedule at the last minute as I am pregnant and was experiencing pain. The care I received from Dr Patel and Arlene was excellent, both were very through and professional. I will definitely be visiting again. Very happy with the service would definitely recommend< /Review>

<Review>This place gets 1,000 stars. My son is fearful of the dentist all 8 years of his life & has always gone there. They’ve always done their best to make him comfortable and do a great job cleaning.
We got a cleaning today & the staff is super friendly and accommodating to my son as always. Thank you for always doing an outstanding job!<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>116221938949411063346</userid><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<response>None< /response><review>The doctor I had today was absolutely amazing! She was so kind and she took so much extra time with me and went the extra mile. She also is helping me fix and clear up things with my insurance because they denied a root canal that clearly needs to be done. Also while she was working on me she was so kind, patient and gentle. I don’t do well with dental work, yet she was able to make me feel calm and at ease. I truly appreciate everything she did for me today!</review><user_name>Samantha Schreiner< /user_name>< time>

<Text>The wait time wasn't very long at all considering that I just got the appointment that same day but unfortunately I had to leave in the middle of my appointment so I can't give the review on the dentist themselves but I can honestly say from past appointments that I've never had any problems.. I think the dentist do excellent work.👍</Text></record>

I was at Western Dental in Poway today with my husband and son. My visit was professional and enjoyable especially since going to the dentist is not a favorite thing.  I would like to give a special thank you for Erica G. for her great work with me. She made sure I was never nervous. Overall the appointments went very well.

Thank you.

<review>I'm not a fan of the dentist but Shiva and the good doctor at the Corona office took good care of me today. Made me feel comfortable,  and with minimal pain. I can't wait to get back to get the rest of this work done. If I had folks like this from the beginning I would have never felt embarrassed and ashamed to go see them resulting in less work and less money needed.  All my fault, but with these people and the comfortable setting they provided ill be back when I'm supposed to. Never felt this comfortable with any dental provider!</review><gmapID>0x80dcd9cf94ada39d:0xf3893975db941c22<//gmapID>< Response>

I am glad to report my Western Dental experience at 2901 E. Broadway in Tucson, Az.was a good one.  All the staff and people at Western Dental were courteous, professional and helpful.  I want to particularly acknowledge my dentist, Dr. Sloan.  He pulled two teeth and made a lower denture for me and also relined my upper denture and lower denture.  Dr. Sloan was considerate and very good in all his work.  So I am very appreciative and thankful for Western Dental and their people.  BY Gerald Erikson on March 17,2021.</Text>

<Text>First of all, kudos to Tech Chris Wilson who took my X RAYS. I'm not a great patient when it comes to that, but Chris was very patient with me and made it a tolerable experience.  Chris also assisted with my tooth extraction (I believe his first one ) and did a wonderful job. The staff is very friendly. The only thing I had a problem with was scheduling me for a 9 o'clock appointment when they open at nine. I had to wait awhile to get on to see anyone. Seems to me they should open earlier to get patients in near the time of their appointment. Other than that, no concerns.< /Text><username>Cynthia Mayhew</username><Date>1614723532900<//Date>< GmapID>

<review>They are very nice here ! My first time in I was nervous and embarrassed but the lady made me feel very comfortable. She assured me that I had nothing to worry about or to be embarrassed about and that made me feel better! The receptionist is also very helpful, she worked with me to find the right payment plan which helped a lot.
They also follow all procedures that the pandemic has brought, that also makes me feel safe!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I went into western dental for a filling and it was super fast and not painful. Patty R. was great with assisting me to do my x-rays and have everything prepared for the Dr. so that I could quickly get my filling. Thank you WD !<//review>

The place is super clean and staff are very organized.
Dc.Shinali is super professional and caring.
I have been into other clinics and received care from other doctors. Dr.Shinali REALLY knows what she is doing! she is good at explaining things to her patients and she fixed my teeth problems! I am super glad with the service at Western Dental /Chicago Ave branch and I absolutely recommend it .<//Text>

I had a visit with Brident Dental where there appeared to be a misunderstanding on my services to  be rendered...the situation  at the time became very frustrating and upsetting but after calmly speaking with Josephine and listening to her explain the situation things became  clearer .. Dr T. Patel (female) also interacted in the situation at hand  it was confusing  at first but she went high and beyond on getting the situation solved...she had patience...she did not try to blow you off and her explanation was through as well as her assistant Josephine...just wanted to say to Brident Dental that you have to GREAT members on your dental team 😉 Hats off to Dr Patel and Josephine...We need more Dr like Dr T Patel !!</text>

<Review>There are real people who work at Western Dental and as such people have good days and bad days.  That said, my experiences with Western Dental have been mostly positive with only one negative attitude from an employee whom I dont have any more interactions with. I am very satisfied with the care my local Western Dental professionals have given me. I will go back in two weeks to pick up my upper and lower partials. It's been a long road but worth it.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>My grandchild was being bullied because of her smile. Although, she lives in Chicago, I got her braces at WD in downtown Oakland.  I was laid off but got her bill current to resume treatment. Without a text, phone call etc., her appointment was cancelled-after flight and hotel accomodations were made! When she did come in I was scolded and told she would be kicked out of their system if she ever missed an appointment. (Even though I keep her bills paid). Due to a possible Covid exposure I had to reschedule her upcoming appointment. The staff member was so nasty on the phone just because she could be. There has never been any black customer service reps at the front desk even though there waiting room is always filled with black people. To have contempt for the people who pay your bills requires management to reconsider who represents the company.</text><userid>109554515615079518780</userid><pics>None</pics>< Gmap_id>

<review>Keith, my 69 year old hygienist today, delivered the most thorough and efficient cleaning I've had in years!

I'm aware I accumulate plaque between cleanings, but I'll bet the past 6 cleanings were not as "thorough" nor as informative.

I admit I do not brush my teeth daily and especially not twice per day! I do Floss, but only when I brush and usually after I brush; which Keith told me to do before brushing.

Keith's instructions for using my Oral-B was the best I've heard (I probably didn't read the instructions).

I hope that my next cleaning is with this professional.

@Sherman Way Office
Go Dr Jillian and Catherine. Best doctor ever, made me feel so comfortable and she explained to me a detailed step by step so I would know what was happening. They follow COVID safety well too!
Corporate on the other hand is overbooking and making the wait times be 2 hours from your appointment time.< /Text>

Horrible corporate office customer service. Not helpful at all. I have not received a bill in the mail since January. Can't even get a statement emailed. Calling doesn't help or resolve the issue. All they keep saying is we can put in a request. They don't let you speak to a supervisor or give you contact information. Do not use this company. Sucks for the office cause they are great.</text>

abusive and lying staff. not only did the commit insurance fraud and purposefully mess up my teeth for more money, the lady i spoke to DUG HER NAILS into my skin when i asked got a refund. i don’t even understand how this place still operates but they clearly only hire terrible and disgusting people who seek to abuse patients. this place has so many lawsuits for fraud and lying to patients yet they’re still standing. evil place. go elsewhere!!</text>

< Review>
I am so disappointed with Western Dental in Rancho Cucamonga. I have had  total extraction of my teeth and am extremely disappointed in the service I have received from WD. The staff give you a cherry hello,  but contrary to the service. I had problems getting pain meds and insisted to immediately wear denials 24 hrs. seven days before gums heal right after extractions that are extremely painful.
The pharmacist even called and was transferred to 5 different offices to get help for me and still could not get help for me in getting pain meds.
The front desk clerk was playing doctor and the dental assistant. They refused to help me get med.
In addition, we keep being asked to get apply for credit check for $30,000 to get work done.  We, my daughter and I understand the packing of cells to help support our gums, but we just don't have the money.
I was given a prescription for medication I'm allergic to and will run up my blood pressure, and heart attack patient. I am a diabetic with several other health issues.
Even when the girl decided to charge us $15, 000 +.
My insurance has a limited income for me to have.
The teeth are horrible and rough.  To they don't fit. They didn't fit the day of extraction.  They hurt.
This is such a disaster and somebody needs to stop this craziness.
We have been going to Western Dental for a bit, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.<//Review>

< Review>
I have gone to several otrho places for consults for braces for my son. My friend referred me to this dental office and I am very pleased with the service. The office staff is so friendly and the ortho doctor is very knowledgeable and was so kind to my son. So glad we're at Western Dental Corona office.

The only reason for the 4 stars is I'm going to wait to see what our visits will be like in terms of wait time for the ortho. Hoping they are on schedule with appointments as many in the Eastvale area, the wait is usually 30 to 40 mins after you check in for your appt at a certain time.</Review>

The worst company to every  handle business. The customer service representatives are very rude and will not allow you to speak with a supervisor. I have requested numerous times a paid in full letter and I have gotten several excuses and lies. I had the same issues getting monthly statements. Mr. Daniel the CEO should have his staff retrained on etiquette, professionalism, and accuracy. I will make sure to informed my family and friends to never use this service.<//Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcd9cf94ada39d:0xf3893975db941c22<//Gmap_id><text>The absolute WORST run organization I have EVER encountered. I went to this business because I was in pain and I could get an appt. quickly, now I know why. I needed a root canal ,per Western Dental, they told me they will have someone there that can do in A MONTH, and also he is not board certified, or I could get a referral to a specialist so I could get it taken care of sooner. I went that option. Well, the joke is on me. They did not send the referral. I waited 2 weeks then finally called. The office either doesn't answer the phone, or puts you on hold for 30min or more , then says (this happened a few times) you need to wait for corporate to respond. I have called corporate and emailed corporate several times this week. Corporate routes me back to this horrible office and the office offers no help.
THIS IS MADNESS!
AVOID THIS BUSINESS AT ALL COST!</text></record>

I've been coming to Western Dental for many years and I've had several procedures done. I like how efficiently I get checked in and know that they have my dental history available and ready when I walk in. Now with Covid - 19 precautionary safety protocols I feel I can go to my dental appointments and feel as safe as possible.< /Text>

< review>
Worst customer service ever. Paid my contract balance in full and they were still charging me monthly, called numerous of times to explain to them and ask them why am I still being charged when I paid my contract balance in full and all I got was attitude and one of them hanging up on me. Instead of wanting to help, all of the employees I’ve spoke to over the phone seemed very annoyed and not understanding at all. I even emailed customer service 2 weeks ago and yet I have not received a single reply back. Last employee I spoke to over the phone gave me an attitude and told me to ignore my billing payments that came in the mail and that everything was good now and that my contract balance should show $0 now and just hung up on me. They should be able to send me my receipt showing my contract balance paid in full, but yet the only thing I have been receiving in the mail is more western dental billing payment that I shouldn’t be getting because I paid my contract in full already. Seems like this issue is not being resolved or taken seriously at all.

update: 8/3/20 called the billing office and spoke to a lady and she was kind and understanding and said my issue has been resolved and that my discount has been applied to my account and that my contract has been closed because it was paid in full and that my contract balance is now showing $0, finally, all this stress, lets just hope I will be getting my paid in full letter and the statement showing my contract balance of $0 in the mail soon because I did not get it in my email when she said she emailed it to me as well.<//review>

< review>
I started my dental cleanings after I moved to California . I chose western dental primarily because they were close to my home.
Since I began i have seen 4 different dentists no explanation given. In January I needed a tooth removed and was given a contract for a implant. I paid the uninsured balance on the spot. Thinking that was it. After my wait period for the graft to heal I scheduled an appointment to have the rest of the procedure done. When I arrived no one seemed to know what was i there for they had my scheduled appointment as an emergency check in. Oh and another new dentist. After I was seen by the new dentist.  I was presented with a new contract for impression and crown. My original contract apparently did not include this hum
So I compare this to a contractor installing a set of cabinets then coming back a saying oh my estimate did not include doors or drawers .
When I first asked about my contract before I signed it I was told it was for the entire treatment for this one tooth.
Iam absolutely disgusted with the lack of concern for patients and ther inability to know what is going on with each individual.
The wait times are 1hr to 1.5 hrs after scheduled appointment just to see the dentist not very efficient.
I don't usually post bad comments but felt compelled to do so.
I don't have anything bad to say about the staff as they do there best. I believe that corporate policy is to blame . A contract should include all items necessary from start to finish.
Very disappointed client<//review>

Western Dental Palmdale CA office is a new nightmare.
First they ask you to sign about things never discussed or papers never given
Second Had some teeth pulled, had pieces of teeth coming out for months, so my gums weren’t healing. Dentist didn’t extract teeth correctly
Was fitting for partial dentures, which were of such poor quality, after months of readjustments, was told they couldn’t adjust anymore because they would break. Every time they tried to put in upper ones I nearly cried with pain. They just weren’t right. I refused to pay for something I couldn’t use.
Only option was implants, which are costing me a fortune to pay for
I’ve been without teeth for over a year and this office could care less about me as a patient
Do Not Use Western Dental. Seriously Do Not
I have given three complaints to corporate and nit one single follow up , not one.

<text>western dental has been the worst experience I have ever had. They are not organized, no one knows what they are doing and are not friendly to help you.  I set up auto pay with one rep and the next month all of a sudden I was not set up, when I called the rep he was quick to tell me how I plan to make this payment. Instead of asking me how he can help me! My kid was at the ortho for the appointment and was not going to be seen until this was done.
Previously, when switching offices because we moved counties, they made it completely impossible to transition smoothly. It was phone call after phone call, I think it took about 3 months to finally get settled, but the whole time they were taking payments on auto-pay, but yet they were sending us PAST DUE notices and trying to charge us late fees. I can't and will never recommend western dental!!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Apparently they get money for upsell rather then doing what is best for a patient ..let alone one in severe pain.  I'd suggest you NOT go here.  Dentist tells you one story.. oral surgeon another story.  Finance gal another.  This is NOT A DENTAL OFFICE LOOKING AFTER THE BEST INTERESTS OF A PATIENT.<//Text>

Extreamly poor customer service skills. Even when i asked twice to speak with the Office Manager in a different room, instead of standing in front of other customers while we disagreed, she said nothing but, "I am trying to help you". Never the less, we were not seen for my grandsons braces adjustment. This was on a Saturday. I called after we returnd home, left a message for a Office Manger to call me to talk about this and here it is Monday almost noon and no phone call. Very disapointing.< /Text>

I am updating my experience this was not a fun experience in the office. Somone asked me to do a comment here so I could get a free whitening kit. This is how they get you to comment.
Then I received no kit and was waiting on a call from office staff for 3 days.
Never received a call and ended up going to my old dentist office and had treatment done there instead.
I won't be  recommending this place in the future.
The doctor at western dental was nice but my treatment was way different than what was recommended by this doctor.< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Worst place ever. No contact for leadership team. Corp office cust serv cant give you balance of bill and or send you one bcuz they claim they virus is keeping them from sending bills. Craziest thing I have ever heard. Finance dept claims they are not western dental so they dont have business license# for you to report their ethics to state board or Calif dental board but the phone was answered  as western dental. Cant see patients due to virus, understandable, but can call everyday about your bill. These people put braces on my grandaughter in Feb and contracted to see her every month. It's been 4 months and eventhough they are closed due to virus, no one has called to even check to see if her teeth have shifted, if wires were broke or loose or anything. Noticeably the virus is not keeping them from calling about the monthly pmt..I feel her bill should be adjusted every month she is unable to get treatment. These ppl are money hungry. They allowed my grandaughter to sign a 4000 bill, 3 weeks after she turned 18, still in high school, with a 6-10  hour a week part time job. Now that's what you call taking advantage of a high schooler. Instead of checking first to see if she had a qualified income to pay this bill, they just ran her credit and  yes her credit was clear  she just turned 18. Western dental is now her first creditor and going to be her first lesson on what it's like to be 18..thanks Western dental! Now that she is off work bcuz of the virus and cant pay the bill they dont understand but we are suppose to understand they have not treated her in four months due to the virus. I feel there is something really shaky here as you cannot speak to anyone above the lowest employee there, customer service. They even have them filling out your complaints. I see all these ppl joining the leadership team but why are they not accessible to people who are paying 4000 bills that need to file complaints. The bad reviews are outrageous for a dental office. I read they are not bbb accredited so maybe they feel complaints wont go anywhere but I know how I'm getting ready to handle my virus time off. Wish me good luck! Also noticed here, they only answer to positive post and I'm just wondering what city these positive post came from because there are over 500 bad complaints on a different site in los angeles<//review><userid>100417900672709817287</userid>< name>

My last 4 appointments involve Dr. Jhala along with her assistant, Victor. Both are friendly, comforting and reassuring regarding the final adjustments and placement of my dentures.

When ever I have any problem or question, they bend over backwards to correct the issue and answers my questions in detail.< /Review>

Hello My name:
Andrea Herrera,
I had a really good experience with Dr. Wu, at 1407 W. March Lane Stockton Ca. 95207.

My experience I got my X-ray, done also my two fillings, done in the front...Dr. Wu, was very professional he was patient, gentle, but most importantly...

Dr. Wu, made time also for my deep cleaning, with his helpful assistance.

Dr. Wu, assistant Ingria, was very nice and professional I felt comfortable.

Sincerely,

Patient: Andrea Herrera< /Review>

<Text>Have Medical, called and scheduled a simple teeth cleaning. Again, low income. I was told that the Dr. may or may not clean my teeth, and that I needed an examination.  When they finished with the examination, they said I needed beyond a cleaning, and they handed me a bill for 4,700.  what the hell happened to me just getting what I could afford? I simply asked for a regular teeth cleaning.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Western Dental is an overbooked, understaffed, poorly ran company from the dentist to the corporate offices. They will screw up your payments and attempt to pressure you into paying exorbitant fantasy late fees while with holding services. No one will return your phone calls and half the people are unqualified to work in the dental office. Secretaries prepping for dentist without washing their hands or wearing gloves. This is my 7th or 8th call to correct their screw ups!</Text>

Absolutely unprofessional, went in to have my wisdom teeth extracted, they over charged me $1100, had a meeting with my insurance brokers from work last week, spoke about what Western Dental charged me. My brokers reviewed my medical documents and found that they did indeed owe me, they used back office tactics to get me to agree to a 24 month plan, after my insurance reps contacted them, they informed the reps  they callwould call me immediately and credit me, but still have not called..
Wish I could give them no stars.<//Review>

<name>Lucina Nogueda<//name><time>1559195204533< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I'm only giving a one-star review because it's the lowest Google's got!

Currently, I have braces on that were applied by Western Dental. They'd sent me a letter in the mail informing me that they are choosing to no longer do business with me and they were terminating my contract with them. In the letter, it also stated that they were willing to take my braces off and would give me a retainer all for free, because if I kept them on, there was a high possibility that I would get cavities that would not be able to be taken care of until the braces are off.

Well, here is where my issue comes in. I'd called to schedule an appointment with them to have this taken care of. They'd informed me that I would need to pay $200 out of pocket to take them off. I'd mentioned the letter they sent me, but even with the letter, they'd refused to do the service for free as stated. I didn't end up making the appointment, because I didn't have $200 to just give away. So, by that point I was just willing to let it go. Unfortunately, now I've got several cavities beneath my braces that need to be taken care of.

I'd called an attorney, because I knew that them not taking me in initially, unless I agreed to pay that fee, was wrong. When I contacted my attorney, she told me to get a copy of the letter (I've yet to find my original). So, I called the corporate office and a woman named Sylvia was very snooty with me when speaking to her. I'd informed her that I would like a copy of the letter that was sent to me. She told me, "We are not obligated to resend the letter to you. Those letters are just a courtesy from us." I'd then asked to speak with a manager, but she refused and told me that she was the only one that was going to help me, and that if I wanted to have my lawyer contact them, she would have them transferred over to the legal department. She then hung up on me. I called back immediately (very angry at this point for what I'd experienced thus far) and a man answered this time. Once he heard who I was, he then hung up on me also. I called back a third time and Sylvia answered my call. I'd asked why she hung up on me, and she apologized and continued to yell and talk over me. I told her that she was being very unprofessional and giving me terrible customer service. She responded with, "This isn't the customer service department."

By that time I'd reminded her that my calls are recorded.

Now that I'm thinking about it, this is actually the same woman who gave me complications while I was pregnant with my son.

I knew that I wasn't going to get anywhere with her, and she wasn't going to let me speak with anyone else.

I submitted a complaint with the Dental Board for client negligence.

I'll need to call back to report Sylvia for the way she treated me as well as the other gentleman who hung up on me.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcd9cf94ada39d:0xf3893975db941c22<//GmapID></record>

>>EXTRA Zero star<< this place is totally scam, I will definitely sue this company. Hopefully we get ride of Western dental near soon because no one there is professional at all, they don't  care about your situation, they nicely respond to your reviews asking you to call them ! But, whenever you call customer service there is a rude lady who called Silvia doesn't care about your complain, she doesn't have any manners or sense of humor. Don't make a mistake and trust those scammers. All they care is to charge you as high as they possibly can.< /Review>

Highly recommend to go anywhere else but here. Nothing is transparent, they rush you into braces/ any type of work, extremely unprofessional and if you're not on top of your finances/mouth they will do whatever to get you to stay in the contract even longer. Worst decision I could have ever made. The corporate office gives you the run around, promises to call and will not return your calls and several time I have had employees in the corporate office hang up on me and laugh while I am explaining my issue.<//review>

Dentist are not well enough trained . Looked at compliance element's.  Out of date signage posted indicating Dentist credentials.  Qualified dentist could not even give me the name of the metal they use for braces. Which I knew it is stainless steal.  On the form a parent fills out , there is no information regarding to the materials the use in the child's mouth while conducting the oral operations. Dr did not look over health history of patient. And still wanted to proceed moving forward with an operation that could of been very harmful to the patient or even fatal.
Classics and factorial case of malpractice.

I would like a response on what material this company uses when applying  braces in a patient's mouth.  What brand of metal this company supplies for braces and the origin from where it is made.

Even if this company choses not to give out this information,  a well composed discovery  team will deep dive and dig up any documents rrequires.
Dr did not even know about dental compliance required by the state along with federal guidelines.<//review>

<text>Never go there! Ever, they rip you off. It takes almost a hour to get some one on the phone. Then they can't even help you. Say it's not their fault.I don't blame the person that I talked too. All I did was go in for a exam, ex ray, and a teeth. I was chard $1,222.40. Then I was told I needed a guard and chared me  more $745. I cancel the order about a hour later. I was told I needed my wisdom teeth  out. Then why would I needed a bit guard that would not fit after having my teeth out. It also took 8 times to do the impressions. The e ex rays took over a hour to do. I was lied too also. $ 425 for dental hygiene that they didn't do. Also, a hole bunch of other things that wasn't done. I told them I didn't want to watch the video. I was chared $38. I didn't even watch it.  Oh, also I was not aloud to see my e rays. I waned to see if all 4 teeth were in as bad shape. Full of decay. I would have like to see them. I have so much more to say. I'll stop here.< /text>< user_id>

I had all my dental work done at western dental on san bernardino.I had 3 root canal an they got infected an 1 was removed an  .They want it charged me more to put a crown that felt off .they used low quality of pain medication becaused I told them I was in pain an they did not care after my treatment I never went back now I have to replace the other 2 root canal because I got lumps on my gums where they did the root canals, Staff are all rude an show no emphaty towards patients  an they will charge to replace the bad work they do.😰Western dental needs to be cited  for their bad  work😰< /review>

The worst dental company EVER. I’ve been a customer since a little girl, (for 8 years). I put in a grievance with them because they were making me travel two hours just to get my retainers, and wouldn’t let me transfer to the one 3mins from my home, they made my retainers wrong, so when I came back to get them, they didn’t fit. My teeth were spacing out even more because I had to wait another two weeks. They basically said it was my fault and they wouldn’t provide the service to fix this problem without me basically paying for braces a 3rd time with them. I’m disgusted and am done with this company, I’m 24 but I’m going to get veneers instead. They don’t care about the customers and their corporate office is just as horrible as the service in the office. Save yourself the money and headache, after 8 years and about $10,000 of my own money, my teeth are reverting back once again. Absolutely horrible.<//text>

<Review>I went to Western Dental for braces because I thought it would be cheaper but it wasn't even worth it. They told me at my consultation that I wouldn't have to pay any kind of interest with a $0 down payment and they also told me I didn't have to pull any additional teeth out to receive braces. Well I ended up paying a $250 down payment. After they placed the brackets in (without wire or spacers) the lady said I had to pull 4 of my teeth in addition to the wisdom teeth I already had taken out. I told them I didn't want to get extra teeth taken out so I told them to cancel my contract. Then they told he I owed $1700 just for placing brackets on. They didn't even place a wire or spacers yet just little metal brackets. So now I'm looking into a lawyer because I shouldn't have to pay $1700 for that little bit of metal. Now I'm looking into getting a lawyer. They were so unprofessional. They should have told me before they placed bracket on my teeth or I wouldn't have gotten the braces in the first place.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I did my invisalign here and after couple years and getting 3 sets in their irvine office I received an awful result with lots of headache each time I go there!!
This location used to be smile wide when I initially bought my package and they keep changing my dr and later they change the name to Western Dental and again keep changing my doctor.
Their doctors are unprofessional and careless, the only thing they care is money with poor service!
I paid approximately $6k for invisalign. After 3sets with this awful result they are saying oh you shouldn’t do invisalign and since you are not happy you can pay more and do orthodontic (its because their office is stop doing invisalign and they dont want to get responsibility of my result) which is absolutely rude.

I called them several times and they have never called me back. I also called to their cooperation office and talked with Cidney three weeks ago. She was super rude and hangs up phone on me, so I called back and their supervisor told me she will follow up with irvine office and asked their manager to call me which Ive never get a called back!!!

This is not the first time that I am being treated badly and keep giving letter to sign in case they dont get sue. After they got the total payment they started treating me a badly...

If I could them 0 I would definitely give them 0.</Text><name>Athena Daneshmandi< /name></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was under. Payment plan. When I went to complete what i was paying for I was told I had no insurance. Then I was told the dentist that was working on me no longer worked there. I was also rescheduled 7 separate times. Finally I called to stop payment and cancel contract. I was told I would be contacted in 30 days. The office that worked on me didn’t even have their records right about what to charge me. The whole job was suppose to be 1800 and they only completed half. The girl in charge of accounts had the nerve to say I still owed money after paying 1100 dollars. Now I just received a statement for plastic due on something that hasn’t happened. I hat this company. Everyone on the phones are a joke. They are a big rip off!!! Don’t go therr<//review><user>100166029030534938412<//user>< Resp>

My husband has had 3 appointment that the office has cancelled. All 3 times they called the old phone number although they have been told at least 5 times what number to call.
I paid for all of his work before they started anything and now he has temperate crowns in for 3 months. He had an appointment for  tomorrow but now again the Dr is not going to be there. So what is this they take my money but won't do the work. Are they going to pay for the 3 days my husband  has missed  work.<//review>

Let me just say this is the first bad review I've ever made for any company.  I've never had such a bad experience worth my time posting.  But I have to say, Western Dental really just did it for me.  Never mind the bad experience with my braces treatment.  The reason I stopped going to my braces treatment was due to poor communication between staff and doctors that made it difficult to get anything done with my treatment.  As soon as I got those suckers off, I didn't even go to a follow up appointment.  As soon as I could I paid off my contract balance in September.  After many many phone calls and back in forth with customer service, billing, finance, collections. I found out the person who took my last payment failed to cancel auto pay.  In October, they took an unauthorized payment from my account.  When I called them, they said, they would credit my account with in 30 days(why it takes soo long, when it's not even my fault) who knows,  and cancel officially auto pay.  November comes along, they do refund my money, but guess what, they take it right back out with another unauthorized auto payment.  When I call, they say they will "cancel auto payment this time" and credit my account until December.  It's now Dec. 21 "over a month now" and no refund.  Thank goodness, someone manged to cancel autopay, but still I can't get anyone to refund my money for the Nov payment.  Customer service is horrible, it seems like no one knows how the system runs in their own corporate office.  I've never felt so much frustration.  It almost seems like they will never refund my money back.  By the way, I just saw just now, that they have 1.4 stars.  How do they even have almost 2 stars.<//review>

This company has been owing me a refund for over 8 months and I have yet to receive it. I have called the corporate office over ten times and no one has the sense to finally get this issue resolved. Don't trust western dental because they will definitely rip you off.<//Review>

I am an ortho patient at the Alta Loma  Office. I'm totally disappointed with the services. I believe there a rip off scam . I only need my braces n for a year and was charge as if  was keeping them on for 3 years or more over $3100. No only  did they placed the fluoride on my teeth and turn them Yellow and there still yellow after being placed on there over 5 month ago after I was told it will only last 2 weeks. When I mentioned it to them they wanted me to pay over $100 to get them cleaned after it was there fought. I reach out to the corporate office and when they finally got back to me. all they said was there's nothing they could do. well there is something I can do. Then they have a doctor that does not have a clue what she doing my teeth only shifted a little that why I placed them back on . I had no gaps. now I have gaps my teeth and there crocked. I'm very upset I want the agreement cancel and a refund of the payment I provided. if not I filing a small claims in the small claim court. or I will get a lawyer it will be worth it.< /review>

< Review>
THIS IS THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL DENTAL COMPANY I HAVE EVER SEEN.  STAY AWAY!  My name is, Patrick Alexander, and I am a Life & Health Agent for Twin Insurance Services in Southern California.  I accompanied one of my clients to Western Dental to have some work done.  They wrote her a contract for the work to be done and she started making payments in excess of $2000.  When she went back to have the work done the contract they had was different than the contract I had.  We have been trying for over 2 months now to get her a refund with no assistance WHAT SO EVER!  I have never seen a medical practice like this one, it is truly heartbreaking to watch my client continue to suffer from much needed dental work yet the company won't refund her despite not having done any services.< /Review>

<Text>First, this is not a complaint against the dentist or the clinical staff who I found to be very competent.  As for Western Dental's practices, this place is a SCAM!!!  I went to their Gilroy office for cleaning and a cavity and was told that I could not refuse the Gingival Irrigation which increased my cost from $187 to $585.  $49 per quad, twice...$392.00.
This is not true, nor ethical and per my insurance company not necessary.  Following up with complaint to the California Dental Board, although based on the nonchalant attitude when I called corporate to complain, this is not new to this company.  They were eager to cancel my follow up appointment without even asking why at the local office.<//Text>< pictures>

I normally don't write reviews but the Western Dental I am  currently taking my son to has left me appalled. My son is receiving care at the branch in Compton on Long Beach blvd and the front office staff is horrendous . He has braces and it is so hard to get an appointment with the Orthodontist. His last appointment which was last week we waited 2 hours and 15 min  to be scene. I work in a doctors office so I understand that the staff can't control the doctors time but the staff was so rude when I asked " How much longer would it be ?" I mean I felt HORRIBLE after leaving the office that day. They were rude, standoffish,  and so unprofessional. Honestly, I've experienced this since my first appointment there. I feel like I made a bad choice while handling my son's healthcare. Also, at his last appointment I was notified he'll be under the care of a different Orthodontist who has a total different approach then the previous one. Which means more time on his current contract !!!!! I am so bothered by this office<//Text>

Okay I went to my local Western Dental and was treated horribly!!!  First of all the receptionist in the ortho department  yelled across the room because my kids wanted to help fill out the paperwork they give you. I’m 40 years old with 6 kids. I’m blind as a bat..  I’ve always had help filing out them packets. Never had any problems. This 18/19 year old girl yells excuse me you need to fill that out yourself.. They can’t help you. When I look back at her, and asked why? She smart mouthed back because YOURRRR the PARENT!!

KEEP IN MIND THE LOBY WAS PACKED.  Embarrassed doesn’t begin to describe how I felt. So after about 10 mins or so I got one packed done, and she called up one child’s name... I got happy. She asked me if I’m done?  I replied, Ya with one, not both... She said. “ Well you can either hurry up and finish or  reschedule because the ortho stuff is getting ready to go home... I said what?? Then she continued to tell me to just come back in the following week because it give me time to finish the paperwork. Here my problem the time she’s saying staff is going home was the same time that my second child’s appointment was  schedule .. 4:30! Ummm how you figure that. Why are they sending me away when I have another appointment slot. Trying to act like I’m taking long to fill out paperwork. Sooo rude.

So I leave, then go home and call to get the gals name so I can talk with manager about this situation.. Wouldn’t you know the person who answered the phone acted stupid soon as they realized why I was calling and refused to give me anyone’s names.. oh, talk about playing games!! A bunch of adults going to a training school for a year and half and no one can teach then a little class.

As a local business owner I can tell you that that no way to treat people. I had to call corporate. I don’t know if it helped, however the reviews speak for themself. It’s to bad that they are about the only option many people have who need to make payments. I can tell you have six kids this is the only reason I am forced to keep going back. Maybe the bad reviews will help them improve things. Train their workers or start to let go staff who mistreat and act disrespectful toward patient..< /text>

< Review>
This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at any type of medical/dental facility....
I was seen fairly quickly, the dentist and assistant were decent, but while I was lying in the exam chair (in excruciating pain from an exposed nerve in my tooth)
This receptionist kept coming back to get my credit card to pay for my tooth extraction.
 The first time she made a mistake and overcharged  me for unwanted products I explained I didn't want. She again took my card to void out the first charge of $84.70
 She Charged my card a second time for the corrected amount of $59.70.
 She returned a third time to inform me I still owed the office approximately $10.
I instructed her to use my card. She replied to me that my card was declined for insufficient funds.(I'm starting to panic)
 I asked why the voided sale amount from the first charge wasn't on my card?( By now I'm numb but really confused )  She told me a voided sale amount wasn't going to be back on my card for 24 hours.
 I explained to her the funds on my card ( which was plenty to cover my $59.70 copay) was all the money I had until my payday. She suggested I set up an autopay contract to deduct the money from my card the following day when she informed me that the voided sale amount would be back on my card. I am hurting, my numbing medicine is wearing off, and she brings me 3-4 receipts to sign.
This receptionist comes to me again shortly after my tooth was extracted to tell me the office wasn't going to charge me the $10 balance I owed (for her damn mistake) and gave me a copy of the voided sale receipt and the final sale receipt along with a copy of the service I received. AGAIN SHE INFORMED ME MY VOIDED SALE AMOUNT WOULD BE BACK ON MY CARD 24 HOURS FROM THEN!
Needless to say, the voided sale amount WAS NOT ON MY CARD 24 HOURS LATER!!! It took me 4 days of calling to Western Dental Corporate Office, being transferred to countless phone operators who claim they only know how to make appointments!  (Beyond Madening)
I finally found out from a supervisor I demanded to speak to that there will be an audit report done and a refund process began that will take 15-40 business days to know where my money went and when it will be returned to me. (Seriously )
Very unprofessional and the receptionist should NOT be allowed to ask  people for credit cards while they are incapacitated and in excruciating pain.

My advice to you is :
TAKE CASH WITH YOU TO PAY FOR SERVICES RENDERED!!
NEVER GIVE YOUR CARD TO A RECEPTIONIST TO SWIPE FOR PAYMENT IF YOU AREN'T DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM!
A $60 dentist bill ended up costing me $140 that day
I still haven't heard back from the corporate office about my refund.

I know I will NEVER make that mistake again, sadly you don't expect something like this to happen from your dentist.<//Review>

I think it is time to submit complaints to Consumer Protection Bureau against this company. I too have horrible experiences with their services and billing.  I have already submitted my complaints to the proper government unit. Let's stop this financial malpractices they've been doing. This is my first time giving review to a company. Western Dental had gone to my last nerve. Negative star to this company.</review>

I don't want referral no one. Worse worse service. Bad experience. You loose you time and money. I done my bridge and crown. Over $8500.00.  I have issue. Crawn look like crack when they made add top porcelain. I ask why is that? They said it is teeth shape?????. I never saw that tipe teeth shape. 3-4 times they chance crown, bridge. Look like unprofessional made in lab.  All bridge and crown worse. I am very sad.  I go end of the January Santa Ana office I wait one hour.  After one doctor come she  tell me I am not you doctor. You doctor she is not in the office until middle the March. I ask I have a pain and bleeding. crown very sensitive, each side bridge sit  to much inside gum and bleeding, hard cleaning. She said wait until she  come back after 1.5 months. I don't want put either one star. Western dental service. But computer not posted if you not click star. I called many times customer service. No one take care problem. They hang up or transfer many deportment and end of they hang up. When they know  I have issue they disconnect phone. Don't waist you time and money. You don't thinking they price cheap . Thinking you time and you money.<//review>

I can truthfully say I regret all business I ever did with this company. Especially the staff at the clinics, my god, what a nightmare. HOW DO YOU ALLOW SOMEONE TO SIGN UP FOR AUTO-PAY AND NOT EVER SEND THEM A RECIEPT OR A STATEMENT?! Everything about this company is garbage. Its my own fault for not listening to the reviews.
When I reached out to ask for a statement, they said they would send me a "courtesy" one. Like they're doing me a favor for paying them . Ugh!!!<//Review>

Greedy, liars, thieves, employees who can not even speak without grammatical errors. This is truly an out rage. Taking money, making up new contracts once one is already in place, changing prices along the way, loosing payments, claiming not to have received payments, tacking on more to pay at the end. Taking one to collection because your contract was finished PAID off 100% and then they decide to add on another $900 more to an additional contract that was never even drawn up till the end of the service. This is corrupt beyond corrupt. I would take down each one of those mo fo's if even given a chance.< /Review>< Time>

<Review>My 8 yr old was referred from tr Vista office to see a specialist at the Venice & Western office. First of all it looks horrible and dirty from the outside , even my son had a comment about way the building looks. Then when we got inside and checked in, the staff could not find his paperwork from the other office, then we waited for an hour , when we finally got called in, they had the wrong X-ray and then they displayed someone else X-ray on the screen. finally after all that was figured out the Dentist Dr Knapp was extremely rude and did not want to discuss anything with me , she tried to kick me out of the room. Then she walked my son to another room and wanted to strap him down and did not want me anywhere in sight, after fussing at her she refused to see him. VERY Rude and she has a short temper as if she is on the verge of a break down  when a parent has questions for her.<//Review></record>

THERE SHOULD BE CRIMINAL CHARGES BROUGHT UP TO THIS COMPANY'S BILLING DEPARTMENT. MY ACCOUNT WAS PAID OFF, SEVERAL MONTH LATER I STARTED RECEIVING COLLECTION LETTERS FOR 2 DIFFERENT AMOUNTS. AFTER PRESENTING COPIES OF CONTRACT AND PAID AMOUNTS TO THE PASADENA OFFICE , MANAGER WHO'S  NAME IS ANA AGREED TO SUBMIT AN ADJUSTMENT. SEVERAL MONTH LATER NO ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN DONE AND COLLECTION  IS POSTED ON  MY CREDIT REPORT.  AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORST, WHEN I ASKED FOR AN ITEMIZED BILL, THEY EMAILED ME MY BILL ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER PATIENT FILES. THEY DON'T EVEN PAY ATTENTION WHEN THEY MAKE HIPPA VIOLATIONS. I ALSO FILED A COMPLAINT WITH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.HOPE THEY CAN HELP. IT'S DISTURBING THAT WESTERN DENTAL  CAN GET AWAY WITH WITH SUCH A WRONGFUL ACCUSATIONS , POST A NEGATIVE INFORMATION ON CREDIT REPORTS, AND HARASS THEIR CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY GOT PAID THE AMOUNT THAT WAS ON THEIR CONTRACT.STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.<//text>

The latest disclosure follows recent accusations by state regulators that Western Dental was providing "shoddy, dangerous" medical care to patients and operating a "low-quality dental mill" in which dentists were encouraged to over-treat patients to maximize profits.

I have been having a reoccurring problem regarding the failure in Western Dental payment processing database. This company has not taken any kind of responsibility in the system crashing and I am tired of being victimized by the negligence, unprofessionalism and incoherence of this company. I have been dealing with an issue regarding back payments and when I spoke to your customer service team I was told that he would open an investigation and will hold any further processing on my account.  That was a lie, I was never contact and a month letter I receive a letter from collections. I need the insure resolved immediately and would like to be contacted immediately.<//review>

1st visit 1989 and many visits since
1989- had major work in Western Dental Hawthorne Blvd, Lawndale, CA
1992 to 1999 numerous minor visits
2001-2002- visits for after assault work
March 2012- spent $6,000 over what my insurance crowns, root canals
May-June 2015- had more work done approx. $2k. Left being told paid up
October/November 2016- pain from non cavity hole in tooth. before they
just puts drops said nothing can be done
November/December 2016 made appointment. Went in told cannot see
me I was in collections-would not tell me what for or how much. Made
me look like a fool in front of at least 10-15 customers.Later I
contacted support says cannot tell me what collection was for-I said I
am the patient. After 5 people I ended up with Argon collection agency
who would not tell me anything, just said give me a credit card or I will
ruin your credit, which they had already done . My FICA went from 805
to 699. I contested with all Credit agencies and won. Come to find out
they  filed incorrectly to insurance company, so $700.00 not paid. they
were sending bill to wrong Address. I have statement from person
who received my bills and returned. I had to pay almost 900.00 on
December 11, 2016 to clear.
March 22, 2017- I called to make appointment as the pain has become
unbearable, 4 people told me I was in collections even though I paid
back in December. Person #5 at Western Dental corporate offices- "Oh
I see you already paid. Someone forgot to un-flag you". I said sho do I
complain to  about all this mess. It is all you guy's fault. Oh let me
transfer you- after 30 minutes i hung up
March 17, 2017- later that day. I called and was on a phone with operator
at Western Dental for about 20 minutes. She called the Office I was to
go to to see if they  would see me with no problem now. She came back
and said yes they will see you, no problem. So I go at 3PM. Again in
front of no less than 10 people they embarrass me by telling me loudly
you cannot be seen you are in collections.
that is it I am done, I will make sure I post this same complaint on Twitter,
Linkedin, facebook(numerous pages) as well as any other site that will let me post. I am also going to send our local news stations with watchdog reporting this story as well as a letter to the editor in the local newspaper.

it may not be much, but if I can save a few people the agony Western Dental gave me- the better I will feel!!
IT WAS MARCH 22 NOT MARCH 17TH LATER THAT DAY WHEN I WAS TOLD I COULD GO IN, SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<rate>1< /rate><review>(((ZERO STARS))) I came to western dental  6 months pregnant with a broken molar. they charged me so much to fix it and i was not in the mood to wait around until the baby was born. when i went to get my replacement crown they could not find it.... i had to go back and have a new model of my teeth re done sooooo annoying... so finally went back and had it done. once it was done i noticed that they tooth was not along the gum line there was too much space between the tooth and the gum line. i asked and they said that i needed to give it time so my gums will get used to the false tooth being there... anyhow time passed and 3 yrs later i wake up and my face was the size of a beach ball the tooth was infected. bacteria and food had gotten into the tooth because of the space between the tooth and gum line. (((WORST PAIN EVER!!!)))  I had to miss work and have a retreatment on the tooth and pay another 3 grand AT THAT POINT I WENT TO ANOTHER DENTIST WAS NOT GOING TO RISK DEALING WITH THE BS... now im stuck with WD on my credit for a shotty job... DO NOT GO HERE.!!!!

THEN HERES THE ICING ON THE CAKE I HAVE 2 DIFFERENT BALANCES ONE FROM WD AND ONE FROM A COLLECTION COMPANY ON MY CREDIT REPORT AND NEITHER SAY THAT THEY CAN TAKE ONE OFF... WTH IS UP WITH THAT??<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Every time someone speaks to make an appointment they take more than 20 minutes reviewing your entire history. If you are already a patient, I don't see why you have to give all your information and ask for only the basics. They could be more direct and just schedule the appointment!

(Original)
Cada vez que habla uno para hacer una cita se tardan mas de 20min repasando todo tu historial.  Si ya eres paciente no veo por que tener que dar toda tu información y pedir solo lo básico. Podrían ser más  directos y solo programar la cita!<//text>

(Translated by Google) I had an appointment, they gave me a credit card and they gave me the bill, they took out two teeth in a few days, they gave me the tooth, everything was alive until I got the tooth, they gave me an appointment, I went at 8am when the dentist saw the tooth, he said that it was not permanent, in addition to his very dirty robes, the Dr had a nail full of fungus, it gave me disgust and if I want a permanent tooth, it is the same total 5,000 dollars for a tooth because I have never heard two bad bones and faces here in pittsburg and That is not all, they injected me with an anesthetic that gave me a cold and it was hot time until my contract form, I have to see how I jumped from cold and lasted until 11 at night that intense cold in the heat of the that day
and they say that they planted me 2 little bones of 400.00 dlrs each, I think they are lies, nor did the wound hurt me.

(Original)
tuve una cita me dieron crédito Card y lla que firme me dieron la cuenta me sacaron dos dientes en unos días me dieron el diente todo viva bien hasta que se kebro el diente me dieron una cita fui a las 8am cuando vio el dentista el diente dijo que no era permanente además sus batas bien sucias el Dr tenía una uña llena de fungus me dio asco y si quiero diente permanente es otro tanto total 5.000 dlrs por un diente porque eso que dos huesitos nunca lo e oído malos y caretos aquí en pittsburg y eso no es todo me inyectaron una anestesia que me dio un frío y era tiempo de calor asta en mi forma de contrato se a de ver como brincaba yo de frío y me duró asta las 11 de la noche ese frío intenso enmedio del calor que había ese dia
y disen que me plantaron 2 huesitos de 400.00 dlrs cada uno creo que son mentiras ni morado se me puso la herida.</text>
