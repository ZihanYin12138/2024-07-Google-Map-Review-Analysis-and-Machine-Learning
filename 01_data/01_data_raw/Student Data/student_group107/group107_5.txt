<review>Emelie was excellent to work with.  She went above and beyond what was asked for.  We had an issue with our current lender and her team was relentless in getting what we needed to close the mortgage.  I would recommend her and her team to anyone looking for a mortgage.  Thank you very much for hard work!</review>< username>

<review>Emelie Maybrook helped us secure our first property. She is very thorough in every aspect of the process, carefully explaining in detail every situation encountered. She is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in her field and definitely recommend that you use her services if you are in the hunt or in the process of securing your first mortgage or refinance.< /review>< Date>

Recently we refinanced our home through Land Home. Austin Clarence helped us with every detail of the process. It was so convenient to be able to complete the forms online, ask questions vis text/email and have the Notary come to our home to sign all the paperwork. If you are looking for a great mortgage company, this is the place to go. Thank you Land Home Financial.<//Text>

This company by far is a hoax and a fraud. My parents home was struck by lightening months ago and the insurance company State Farm wrote the insurance check in both my parents name and Land Home Financial's name. My parents endorsed the check and sent it to this unprofessional pool of thieves. My parents are older and I and my siblings have called and requested return calls without any follow-up till this day. My parents have been informed of so many reasons as to why they haven't sent their check. Guy Ramey and Art Freeman are professional liars who prey on their clients at times of distress by stealing insurance checks for professional or personal gain. I wouldn't advise anyone to buy or refinance a home through this company.<//Text>

Dan and his team were awesome! Everything was done quickly and effectively. Dan made himself available all of the time to answer any questions or concerns, however there were very few. Most of my questions were answered long before I every asked them. All of the people on his team shared the same happy and positive demeanor. The whole process was smooth and pleasant. Dan is a true professional and a pleasure to work with! I do highly recommend him and am happy to be asked about my experiences with him to verify my review!</review>

Frank   at the Pasadena location was able to get our refi in within three weeks and helped us  get the lowest rate out there. Frank has done three refis and one new home mortgage over the past six years and has always delivered trust-worthy, quick, and problem-free loans. We are able to sign most of the docs online and just required one short in-house notary visit to finish everything up.  You can't go wrong with Frank!</text>

Jacob Kuzman was our mortgage banker and he was phenomenal!  I identify as an analytical person and he was so patient to answer all of my questions.  He even went so far to understand that he could anticipate my next questions and have options ready.  There are many choices in a refi and he did an absolutely outstanding job in all facets.  I plan on following up to map out the next step for my portfolio and will easily say he will have my business again in the future.  If you're looking for someone who knows what they're doing and looking to help YOU and not their own bottom line, Jacob is your guy!< /review>

<Review>Barry Johnson is the guy you want to talk to. I can’t tell you enough how awesome this guy was. The process wasn’t the easiest for me because I wasn’t as prepared as I thought I was. But he got me to the finish line and we closed on our first home 2 days ago. I’m still emotionally in disbelief. Thank you Barry!!!!</Review>< Pictures>

I had the pleasure of working with Marc yu. Marc was very honest and knowledgeable, he kept me informed every step of the way. Once Marc had my loan approved he let me know that I would now be working with his realtor Martha Macias. He also told me that I could contact him anytime.
I met Martha Macias and she was also very honest, nice and knowledgeable. Martha didn't rush me, she took her time and answered all of my questions.
Marc and Martha were both so genuine, it makes me want to buy another house just to be around them. I really enjoyed the entire process. I will definitely be referring everyone that I know or hear about to Marc Yu and his team.<//text>

<text>Horrible mortgage company!!!! Stay away. It wouldn't let me click no stars!!! Never talk to the same person twice. I sold my house on 10/25/16. They took my taxes out of escrow on 10/20/16. I have been calling the county for three weeks every day to see if they have been paid!!! They weren't so I started calling Land Home Finical on 10/25/16 they said they would have to put a request to send me that info. It over a week to receive anything on there part and numerous calls back and forth. When I finally received the letter it states that they sent the check to my house which is total B.S. So now I am stuck paying the taxes because Land Home said I would have to wait another five business days to see if the check has been cashed. Never in my life have I ever got this much run around. I am also filing a complaint with the BBB,</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>My review of Land Home Financial Services, Inc. (LHFS) is from an employees prospective. Although I am also a Land Home Customer as they service my loan, I wanted to provide my experience with the company from an employee prospective. Land Home is a great company to work for. Not only do they have every product that I need to succeed, they also have many of the latest tools to build my loan origination business. Land Home has been making many investments to ensure that the sales force has all the tools to ensure the best customer experience and build a solid network of happy referral partners.

I would recommend Land Home as a partner to any loan officer or branch manager that is looking for a home run platform!

Thank you Land Home Financial for your support over the years and your continued commitment to your employees aka family!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

If I could give them a negative 10 I would.  This company and it's representative not only left me $2300.00 financial loss out of pocket but also homeless!!! From the branch manager in Jupiter, FL who I was dealing with, Vincet Fiordilino, to David Ornelas and lastly VP of Sales, Tony Wicke, all seem to disappear after I emailed them all the receipts and demanded my money back. What a shame and poor representation of a corporation!  People BEWARE PLEASE!<//text>

Linda Roberts-Waite is fantastic! After initial inquiries for a refi resulted in four similar offers, we went forward with CitiMortgage because they were our previous servicer (we thought that would make it easier - hah!) After two months of getting the run-around and no real progress, Linda happened to email me to follow up on my original inquiry. I am so glad she did, and that we decided to switch over to Land Home! Their online process went very smoothly, and it was a pleasure to work with Linda—she was very responsive, helpful, and patient with all our questions. She got us a really great rate (lower than CitiMortgage) and the loan closed within 4 weeks. I HIGHLY recommend Linda.</review>

It was pleasant this time since they got a new manager.   She was very respectful and courteous.   The store was clean and everyone went out of their way to be kind and helpful.   Trust me I critique hard and if you get this kind of review you must be doing something right.</text>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>If you're new to Lane Bryant make sure you set up your own account online. If they offered to make you an account, don't believe them. Don't let them waist your time as of they're doing something for you on their screen when they're really not. I been a customer for quite some years already and I just found out today that all the purchases I've made, I've never received points for. It's really disappointed special when you know your purchases are from $150 to close to $400. The Customer Service is poor. At some locations the San Diego and Ventura location I can't complain about. As this location out of the 4-5 girls that are working only 2 will care about you finding what you're looking for but you have to ask for help. I wish I could remember their names to give the credit on this comment but I know for sure it wasn't the supervisor. The checkout is horrible you can stand there for 10-20 minutes with a person in the registered and they won't even acknowledge you. I really wanted to tell the cashiers something stupid when she asked if I was ready, but I know I would of made her feel retarded for her sarcastic question. Returns are not bad, it's mostly the wait and you need your receipt and the items have the have their tags.< /Text><name>Patricia Gutierrez< /name>< Gmap_id>

Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Dressing rooms are very comfortable and posh.  Only thing I'd like improved is the quality of under garments from company.  It's thinner and a major difference.  I won't be getting anymore from LB. 4 stars earned by the staff,  3 stars for LB.<//Text>

Service staff just ignored me and when I tried to ask a question 15 mins after being told they’d be right with me I was again rudely ignored. I was also told by another store that this is the one to come to bc they have the biggest selection...selection was terrible. There were literally 3 pairs of jeans for everyone in one style. No assortment at all. Won’t come here again.< /Text>

Although I did find the shirt that I was looking for at the time, thats all I bought because the rest of the clothing there seemed very second hand-ish. There were some shirts I picked up to see and they were either dirty or had make-up on them. Most of their clothes seemed very day to day. Shirts and capris, which is fine but throwing in a nice blouse to go out or some business attire for work like the other Lane Bryant stores I've been in would be good to. The staff was nice.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Love this taco truck. The food never disappoints and if like your asada a bit more cooked they'll do it with no complain. They please to serve the customer. Me and the family have been eating from them since they started on florence and Mountain view.< /review>

< Review>
Their tacos de Birria are the best! Every time I'm in the area I try to make space in my stomach and time in my life to get a few with their awesome cucumber lime agua fresca.

I recommend them. I also hear great things of their Al Pastor.</Review>

So, so...we haven't been going places, just wanted to stop for some tacos. Ok, so the tacos are not that bad but I've tried better ones. Also with this Covid 19 thing and a little before, the lunch trucks have been raising their prices. So these tacos are 1.50 for Asada and 2 for tripas if you guys are interested.<//Text>

<Time>1569320465979</Time><rating>5< /rating><text>The al pastor tacos are delicious. The meat is thick red big and juicy. They are served w/bits of pineapple which only makes them taste better. They have cucumbers, salsas, red onions, cilantro, limes, anything you might need for your tacos that you can grab. The food truck is on Pacific and they are parked right in front of the restuarant. So you can turn on California St. to drive into the restaurant parking. There is plenty of seating space in the restaurant. Most of the staff is by the food truck. I have only tried al pastor and those tacos get the 5 stars.< /text>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I got a Cuban torta. Worst Cuban torta I've tasted. Also they messed up my order. Which all ot was was put the avocado and queso de puerco on the side. They argued with me that they didnt understand what I meant. I explained again. Well all they did was scrape a bit of the avocado off instead of making a new one. And I hate avocado. Also to find out they had also put queso de puerco on it. All in pieces. So I had to scrape the rest of the avocado off so I had to take out the beans,lettuce and mayo.  And the queso de puerco was a pain to take out all the pieces. Will not ever return here.< /Text>< Pictures>

I have been shopping  at Hollisters many times. I am able to find the clothes I like at bargain prices,

I came back to your store to shop on 10-15-19 in the evening around 2:40 pm. There were no other customers in the store. There  was clothes on the floor and I had trouble trying to locate your clearance items.

I had intentions of starting a membership there, but the  cashiers were young and not really interested in answering my questions or helping me start a membership. I realize that cell phones create a distraction. Your employee was rude, arrogant,and failed to make eye contact with me. The other employees were using their phones for personal calls.

I like shopping at your store but I will not return due the clutter, lack of customer service, and the arrogant behavior

< Review>
I took my family to this location last weekend for my wife's birthday.Rather then attempt to walk the length of the store with a double stroller I chose to wait for them in the front of the store entrance. This location actually didn't have the space to accommodate me when I attempted walking through the store with the stroller initially. As I waited at the store entrance every store emplyeee seemed to walk up to where I was waiting and would just stare. Keep in mind the store has two recliners out front as you enter and I was utilizing them. One by one they would walk up to the entrance and rather then ask if I needed assistance or even ask what I was doing they would instead just stand there and stare at my two children sitting in the stroller and I. This went on for nearly half an hour. Once I even asked if I could help THEM with something. I recommend the kids working at this location take a course on customer service and language and communication skills. Or is it the objective of HOLLISTER JEANS to make its customers feel as uncomfortable as possible? At the end of the day that was my money that paid for their items and I will not be bringing my family back to this location again.</Review>

We have had a great experience with them! We've been three times now and have a fourth and fifth coming up. I'm 37 and just got my first tattoos with them. My first ones were simple ones, an alien and a moon on my hands. The second one was the archangel, Michael, on my neck. Anthony did the ones on my hands and popped that cherry lol. Scott did the one on my neck. Both sessions came out great. Scott sat down and talked with me for 30 minutes and wanted to make sure I had thought things through before blasting my neck right away. Shows me he had integrity. At the end of the day, I decided to go for it. Great experience. Thanks again guys! See you soon!</Text>

On Feb. 3rd Anthony far exceeded my expectations. I never received such respect from any artist who has worked on me. The environment was great, staff was curtious professional and above all, respectful. I will be coming back one day. Thanks again!!!</Text>

<review>The shop looked pretty cool. The interior is nicely decorated and has a homely vibe.
I went into the shop to check out some portfolios and I was met with Scott.
He was nice and professional and his portfolio was nice.  His work has a lot of realistic animals that looked really good. I just couldn't go with the shop because I was a little intimidated after seeing a portrait of what seemed to be Adolf Hitler on the last page of his portfolio. No one was racist towards me during my visit but I just did not feel comfortable after that.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>By far one of my favorite tattoo shops. My battle buddies and I came in around 2000 from Fort Irwin as walk ins and they tatted all of us. My artist was Alberto and he did two tattoos on me, both came out amazing. The shop was clean, the atmosphere was friendly and they honestly made my night. I would definitely recommend to anyone to go here and I definitely am coming back in the few years I’m stationed here. Not to mention the work they do is beautiful.< /review>< Pics>

Awesome place and staff!! This is the second tattoo Mike did for me. On both occasions he was able to accommodate my schedule and met my expectations.  He was very gentle while tatooing me and although it hurt, it was worth the pain. (Heck yea!!) For being such a young artist, he’s very talented. He will go far. I wish him nothing but immense success. Keep up the great work guys and continue to encourage each other...just like Scott, his dad was with Mike that night. 👍🙂< /text>

First thing you'll notice when walking into the shop is it's very clean and professional. They were right on it the second I walked in, answered my questions, suggested which artists would be best for the style I wanted, and gave me each artists work to look at to make my own decision. After looking at the different artists work, which were all great, I went with Scott G. and a great choice it was, he was very attentive to detail, and really made the tattoo I wanted unique. Even touched up on an older tattoo I had to really make my overall chest look great.

Definitely going back for my next piece!</text>

Horrible experience. I went with my best friend while I was down visiting her to get tattoos to mark our 20 year friendship. I told her I did not want to get tattoo by 2 different people but that's all they offered us, my best friends tattoo is so nice and the needle work was thin and girly. Mine on the other hand the guy used a bigger needle so mine looks much thicker, and the ink looks like it bleed under my skin while her didnt, then the next day it was extremely sore, very very red and oozing ink and liquid. A week later my leg is still warm to the touch, very red and infected. My dr now has me on antibiotics. The guy assured me the needle he was using was clean but he had it out before I got in the room because I had walked out to see the placement of my friends to see if hers was ok. Her tattoo artist Joe I would go back to the guy who did mine Chris horrible work and gave me an infection.</review>

This place is great!  Chris Burnett did my first tattoo,  and he did an amazing job.  He is a true artist.  The shop itself is very clean and inviting. It was all around a great experience,  and I will definitely be going back.<//review>

<Review>I had heard and read great things about this place but my experience was poor. I was charged $60 for a very small wrist tattoo. Definitely a bit of a rip off. This was my first tattoo and I was not at all told what to expect with its healing process. I was sent away with it bleeding and had to turn and come back and ask for it to be wrapped. The tattoo came out good, but I will definitely not be coming back to this place.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
{'time': 1480732861458, 'text': 'Sorry you are unhappy about the price, that is our min. As well as most shops around the world, in fact it might be on the cheap side. I reviewed our video here at the shop, I found out the Jacob clearly asked to wrap it. As well as we pulled up your release form where you sign that you had been answered every question particular towards healing process. We will look into this more to make sure it is more clear in the future so there is no confusion. Glad the tattoo came out well.'}</response>

<Review>Horrible experience, bad customer service. The guys in the shop were talking about how they were partying in the shop until 6 am the night before. And how they already had to cancel their 10am appointment. I wish now we had taken that slot and saved ourselves the misery. We were asked to sign paperwork before even seeing a design.  The men working were saying really derogatory things about women. When one of us changed her mind, Albert was rude. We even tipped him after the first tattoo because I still wanted something done. This was supposed to be an experience for us and our was ruined by an employee's poor attitude and poor tattoo skills, frankly. The things we were asking of him were not impossible. It is not impossible to so small detail. And it's not impossible to tattoo a friggin' pineapple. And when your day is booked for 3 tattoos and one cancels...how does that mean you no longer have time to do the 2nd one? 0 star review

**edited to say:
I did not get tattooed. I was turned away because the artist "didn't have time." I live out of state and just wanted a tattoo with my cousins while visiting.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><time>1496197554295< /time><Gmap_id>0x80c367917eba6c9d:0x10cf8f7d3d0b76c2< /Gmap_id><Rating>1<//Rating>< response>
{'time': 1495829621021, 'text': 'Sorry you were not happy. We stand on the size and placement no matter what you think he can do. The pineapple would of taken longer he came in to do 3 small shark teeth. He had to pick up his son at a certain time and to miss that would not be right. Again sorry you are not happy, we seen your post on Facebook about how much you loved your tattoo. So at least you were happy with the tattoo. As for the being hungover this is completely out of context. I explain that as I believe your uncle wrote the last review. Which he never has been our business. AGAIN SORRY you were not happy with the service. The tattoo looks amazing because he moved it. Good thing is you never have to come in here again. Best luck!'}< /response>

The place was clean and the staff was  friendly but the tattoos i got are horrible. I got some stuff on my hands.  The ink stained my knuckle and is all black around the tattoo.  The words looked good at first but after a little healing looks like I tried to do it myself. I will have to either pay someone to try to fix the letters or get then all lasered off. By far the worst tattoo I have ever recieved in a Profesional shop.

The owner reached out to me and made it right.  Chris redid the tattoos and they are 100 times better.</text>

Worst most unprofessional Tattoo shop Inhave ever experienced. I went in with 2 friends for Friday the 13 th tattoos and wrote our names in the list mind you this was before 8:30 we waited patiently as we noticed the lady with purple leggings and gray shirt letting everyone that got there after us go before us. We let it slide 4 times and when she let the 5th person go before us we decided to get up and walk out. I get that it’s a lot of people but you couldave been nice enough to say hey these people are friends so I will keep letting them cut in front of you. We would ave left happy but unfortunately the old lhag decided to skip us multiple times I will not reacomend anyone and my friends will not either. Thanks but no thanks<//Text>

{'time': 1495063936789, 'text': "First off the word tattoo is spelled with 3t's. Second is you have never been in my business, so confused how to reply to this review as this is second hand. Albert was not hungover. The moving the tattoo and size was for her best. Where she wanted it it would of not held. The size was enlarged so that the tattoo would maintain over time. By changing the placement and size actually was the best call. I can go around and around on the ideal he was not giving the best experience. At that point I would have to see what your experience and knowledge of what we do is. Being it was her first tattoo, it would be easy to say there would be little or no knowledge of what to experience. I am very confused on why if it was so bad on service but tattoo looks amazing enough to tip at the end of he tattoo.  Again this would have to be discussed with her as she was the one receiving the tattoo. Any more questions we can go over them in person."}<//Resp>

This place was convenient to my house and efficient. I was able to book online and then when they were ready to cut my hair they sent me a text message. I went in and they were on point with disinfecting the place and they're cleaning processes. I had a great haircut and I'll be back.< /Text>

Always feel welcome here, and do a consistently good job on cutting my hair. Never leave without feeling like they've done a good job.

The app they have makes it super convenient and easy to view wait times, and check in for a haircut here.

They've earned my regular, repeat business.</review>

There is usually about a 20 or more minute wait except during school hours on weekdays. The staff is friendly but sometimes they can seem "short" when asked questions. For a regular haircut it costs $20 which is a high considering it is a fast get in and out place, not a private barber.</Review>

I'VE been bringing my grandson here since his first haircut  9 yrs ago.
Love these ladies they"re awesome. I tried a regular barber & my dghtr tried Supercuts...however, they don't compare to SportsClips @ Clayton Valley Shopping  Center. He now lives in Fairfield, CA which has a SportsClips there but he Likes his Ladies @ Clayton..</review>

I had a hard time finding a vet in the area willing to take new patients. We recently moved to Santa Rosa and my dog desperately needed heart pills. I received excellent care. It felt like the doctor really took her time to review his medical history from his prior vet and thoroughly examined my dog. She had excellent bedside manner even though we could only speak by phone due to covid-19.<//text>

We are from Oregon and visit here often and have had very good experiences with your staff.  I accompanied my sister today with her dog.  I realize Covid has forced all of us to experience the new normal.    But because people and dogs can't come into the facility and your requesting people to call first you need adequate personnel  to answer your phones.  Also outside you have a sign to educate people on how hot pavement can be on dogs feet yet people were standing outside with their dogs without cover with the temp 87 degrees.  We always appreciate your expertise but I feel these are important issues to be addressed.  Thankyou, MeeMee D.</Review>

<review>Lately, my experiences with the front desk staff have been incredibly rude, mostly on the phone.  They are short and condescending (last experience 7/7/20).  These seem to normally occur when calling in with questions or prescription refill requests.  I recently questioned the dosage for my 60 pound dog, which by pound would need a dosage of 68.4 mg, yet I was prescribed a dosage for a much larger dog of 136 mg.  This was double the dosage!  For what is basically an insecticide for dogs (flea & tick).  I was met with argument from the front desk clerk, she states she consulted with the vet, but I was not able to speak with him. I was also promised a call the next day from the manager with "approval" to exchange my dosage and I never received a call, which tells me the clerk never even relayed the message to the manager for approval.  This is very concerning regarding the rude treatment of humans that are very concerned about their animal family. The staff is very dismissive  of concerned customers.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

I’ve always had positive experiences with this vet until now.  My cat, who is prone to UTIs, is suffering through another one and because he hasn’t been seen within the past year (it’s been 53 weeks since his last visit), they will not prescribe an antibiotic, and they are too busy to see him for at least 10 days.  So they referred me to Petcare East, who even though they can’t see him either, at least were professional enough to provide me with the names of local vets who will see him this week.  It astounds me that this office can’t make a slight 7 day exception to their prescription policy when they are too busy to see a sick cat with a chronic condition.< /review>

I am in love with this place for a number of reasons. They helped my boyfriend and I locate a lost dogs owner when other facilities turned us away because they were too busy. This morning I was awoken at 6 am to my dog having a seizure (his first one) we ran up to the building to ask for help and they did not hesitate!!!! They were out there in moments with a Gurnee and have him the best care we could have asked for. I love bringing my boy here and he loves it!! Thank you for being so awesome< /Review>

Tap your finger anywhere in the empty field. Click paste. This is going to circumvent the system.
Hello new and old friends!
Drop a single hello, thanks!

The other location provides a way better experience. I had to pull teeth to get any information regarding my dog because the doctor was always too busy to speak. There's nothing worse than your dog is not feeling well and when you can't get any information, it makes you worry even more.</review>

The VCA helped us with our pregnant dog, giving us information we needed to be knowledgeable and provide her with the care she and the puppies needed. They helped us to make sure that our worries during the birthing process were reassured and that the puppies and mama were healthy. Would recommend going there to anyone and I'm thankful for my friend recommending them to me.</Text>

Our kitten ate a long piece of string and got seriously sick. From the very first phonecall to the last, everyone at VCA was kind, attentive, and reassuring. Dr. Laiken (sp?) was incredible: she walked us through every option, took the time to thoroughly explain everything that was happening, and even called to check in on our kitten. We 100% know who our veterinarian will be for all future visits now!</text>

We Went in with $25 first visit. They charge us about $180 without telling us at all what they were doing with our cat. Very very upsetting and frustrating never going back unless you got money to spend here for there spammers.< /text>

From the moment I stepped in the door I was impressed. The waiting areas are good sized cubbies that are semi private, so you can be alone with your pet with out mingling with other animals.
Treat bowls are available for pets & people both as well as what looked like an Expresso machine.
The ladies at the front desk were courteous and helpful. When introduced to the vet you could tell immediately she loves her job and the animals she services. Her name was Brianne, and I would highly recommend her. Articulate in explaining what treatment my puppy was in need of and answered all my questions in a way easily understood.
If you're a senior, discounts are available and were really appreciated.
I've found a new Vet and am very satisfied!
Also, I almost forgot if you go to their website there is a coupon for a free first exam!<//Review><name>Gene Malcolm< /name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I think they are knowledgeable and affordable. They are the go to vet for after hour emergency as they have a second location. I also just recently heard they offer cheap cremation. The last place people need to price gouge is while grieving the loss of a family member.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My Doggo has chronic ear infections. It's been years since they've flared up though, but of course.. they always come back. I love the VCA animal hospital. Always able to fit us in, always super helpful, and super understanding of the fact that doggo isn't nice to strangers. Hes got pretty intense anxiety and needs a little extra to get the care he needs. Even if it means doing some unconventional things to get the job done. The prices can be high, especially if it's an emergency appointment, but the care they give is worth it, knowing someone is always there, and always cares, even when hes being a butthead.<//Review>
<resp>{'time': 1544727082536, 'text': "Alyssa, it's really always a pleasure to be able to fit your precious dog in. We are always more than happy to be supportive and helpful with regard to his ear infections. He's a great pet, and we promise to always go above and beyond for him. Thank you!"}<//resp>< pictures>

I brought an old friend of mine to Kaiser for her doctor appointment. Everything was great, clean, etc. How could you not love Kaiser? I used to belong to Kaiser a long time ago and I miss it.< /review>

They push the cheapest meds on you even if it's listed as "not tolerated" in patient's records. They turn on you if you disagree with them, especially the pharmacy manager being a young man has tons to learn about customer service and "caring". Instead, he will come out to your vehicle and scream at you! I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THE ESCONDIDO PHARMACY AGAIN! I think they all need to be drug tested. I am in the process of filing a legal complaint! Unacceptable anywhere!
p.s. screaming at anyone spreads more germs. That's not conducive to the current situation with covid19 especially since I am HIGH-RISK!<//Text>

I never was a fan of kp. But was so glad that they have blood test, pharmaceuticals, and imaging all in one place. I might become a fan.</Text>

<text>One of our first post pandemic outings, and we're fortunate to dine at Brasserie SLO.  They have a good selection of beers and wines. At first glance their menu is not well-suited for vegetarians but they made up for it with many excellent starters, which we ordered quite a few: Barata with figs, Caesar (not vegetarian), Grilled Broccolini. For my entree, I had the Papardelle.  Finished off with a generous portion of their excellent pecan pie.  Everything was superbly prepared and tasted great.  We really enjoyed our meal in their courtyard.

Service was attentive and unobstrusive.  My only wish that they have maybe a few more vegetarian entrees.<//text><Date>1623731270231<//Date><UserId.>114122567270962169712< /UserId.>< user_name>

We had a lovely brunch here! Staff is really nice and they have outdoor dining. We we're lucky to have nice weather and able to just sit and relax. All the food was great! Don't miss out this place if you are around in SLO.<//Review>

Easily one of the best restaurants in SLO. The French toast is indescribably delicate and delicious. Their duck with ancient grains is beyond tender and flavorful. I’ve had nearly everything on the menu and am still impressed every time I return. The outdoor dining courtyard is also beautiful. The living wall of succulents mixed with the minimalist construction and cozy fire pits makes for a wonderful dining experience.<//review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>My husband and I had dinner with friends on Friday night. Off the bat, we were told that they were out of the new York steak. Ok. My husband and our friend both ordered the scallops instead. They were also out of the scallops. They then ordered the octopus. It came with a curry puree and pickled cauliflower which were good.  However,  the octopus was heavy, heavily salted. I ordered the shrimp.  My shrimp was also heavily salted. Really disappointed...</Review>< response>

Great service, the food is perfection! My new breakfast spot, delicious coffee from a local company Ascendo; so amazing, better than any coffee shop in town! Don't get me started on the Parisian omelette, breakfast burrito-  the chorizo is incredible and so savory with the pickled tomatillos, and the 2 egg breakfast is the best I've ever had! They make their strawberry jam in house and its out of this world.  Also must try the huevos rancheros-phenomenal, and the oatmeal! Cant wait to try the rest of their menu. Took my friend today and she got the avocado toast, its vegan, she said its super delicious!</Text>

The Championion Pizza was probably the best appetizer I’ve ever had and a truly unique flavor profile with truffles.  Also; the skirt steak was to die for over a bed of air fried Brussels.  The staff was organized and clearly took pride.  All of their pies are made from scratch daily and the ambiance was tops.  I think it’s the only restaurant in slo with sound enhancement speakers so you can clearly have a nice conversation without having to yell.  Will be back.  Everyone else loved, not liked, but loved their meal too.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80ecf11263210e3b:0x6bb5b0e7180c138f</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>One of our first post pandemic outings, and we're fortunate to dine at Brasserie SLO.  They have a good selection of beers and wines. At first glance their menu is not well-suited for vegetarians but they made up for it with many excellent starters, which we ordered quite a few: Barata with figs, Caesar (not vegetarian), Grilled Broccolini. For my entree, I had the Papardelle.  Finished off with a generous portion of their excellent pecan pie.  Everything was superbly prepared and tasted great.  We really enjoyed our meal in their courtyard.

Service was attentive and unobstrusive.  My only wish that they have maybe a few more vegetarian entrees.<//review>< pictures>

Easily one of the best restaurants in SLO. The French toast is indescribably delicate and delicious. Their duck with ancient grains is beyond tender and flavorful. I’ve had nearly everything on the menu and am still impressed every time I return. The outdoor dining courtyard is also beautiful. The living wall of succulents mixed with the minimalist construction and cozy fire pits makes for a wonderful dining experience.</text>

<review>My husband and I had dinner with friends on Friday night. Off the bat, we were told that they were out of the new York steak. Ok. My husband and our friend both ordered the scallops instead. They were also out of the scallops. They then ordered the octopus. It came with a curry puree and pickled cauliflower which were good.  However,  the octopus was heavy, heavily salted. I ordered the shrimp.  My shrimp was also heavily salted. Really disappointed...</review><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x80ecf11263210e3b:0x6bb5b0e7180c138f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Top notch service, atmosphere and dining experience!  We absolutely loved this place!  Highly Recommend the grilled striploin and the roasted cauliflower.  Definitely worth the price.< /text>

<review>Great service, the food is perfection! My new breakfast spot, delicious coffee from a local company Ascendo; so amazing, better than any coffee shop in town! Don't get me started on the Parisian omelette, breakfast burrito-  the chorizo is incredible and so savory with the pickled tomatillos, and the 2 egg breakfast is the best I've ever had! They make their strawberry jam in house and its out of this world.  Also must try the huevos rancheros-phenomenal, and the oatmeal! Cant wait to try the rest of their menu. Took my friend today and she got the avocado toast, its vegan, she said its super delicious!< /review>< Name>

<text>Last night my family and I had dinner at the Brasserie and loved everything about it.  The Championion Pizza was probably the best appetizer I’ve ever had and a truly unique flavor profile with truffles.  Also; the skirt steak was to die for over a bed of air fried Brussels.  The staff was organized and clearly took pride.  All of their pies are made from scratch daily and the ambiance was tops.  I think it’s the only restaurant in slo with sound enhancement speakers so you can clearly have a nice conversation without having to yell.  Will be back.  Everyone else loved, not liked, but loved their meal too.< /text>< user_id>

I love this place! They have good food, their menu is varied, The cook in that restaurant is an expert, I like very much tasting all their dishes. The dishes are consistently tasty, the attitude towards the clients  is helpful. I frequently visit this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//Text>

This was a fun spot to hangout. The place is very spacious so that was a nice improvement over the normal dive bar experience. There are two pool tables, a dart board,  and jukebox which was playing all night. The large outdoor space has an overhead shade structure to protect from rain and a propane heater.< /Review>

Esmeralda and Jose tool great care of us! Overall great service and food was pretty good too. As far as something that would stand out, not really. Food portions are generous and it's enough to have a second snack especially if your having dessert. Place looks clean, lots of seat both inside and out. Food takes a bit to come out but worth the wait.< /review>

Fun spot for excellent deli lunch when want to get away from tourist area. Indoor and outdoor seating.

- Stellar diversity
- Large menu
- Efficient service
- Friendly and engaging manager / host
- Decent value

My lox and bagel were great. My wife's order was incorrect twice.

Large table and sufficient room.

Reservations are available in Open Table...would definitely recommend making them prior to arrival.< /text>

<Text>I absolutely love my visits to Palm Springs.  This visit I discovered this place.  They have the best deli food! They have something for every one.  I love their veggie sandwich, breakfast, meat sandwiches.  They have fast become my favorite place.  I have never had a bad dish.  Their food is fresh and delicious! I’m only sad they cannot come back home with me.</Text>< pics>

<Text>From the outside, I thought this place was going to be more upscale than it is. The interior just looks dated and worn. But the staff, huge menu, and great food were better than I expected.  I don't usually like fries, but they have the big thick kind I like. There were 4 of us and we all really liked our meals.<//Text>< pictures>

Excellent.
Excellent in every way. The food, the service - everything. If you are looking for huge portions of fantastic food (each item we got could have been 2 meals), you should try this place. Highly recommended!< /Review>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this great place. happy to tell that we passed a awesome evening and the venue was surely one of the reasons for this strong celebration. The crew  helped in a gorgeous style, the cuisine was yummy and my friends were very  glad. We shall definitely visit again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.</review>

The person that filled my order was rude and abrupt like they were doing me a favor. I ordered sliced cold roast beef, and specifically asked if the meat was rare. The answer was YES. Sure enough, when I got home and prepared a sandwich the meat was well done, NOT rare. Overall a bad vibe in this place. Too bad because the menu, which is overpriced (for example $7.95 for a milkshake), contains some dishes that you can't find anywhere else. I wouldn't mind paying the jacked up prices if the atmosphere was welcoming. I will never ever go back to this restaurant.<//Text><Rate>2< /Rate>< Pictures>

< Review>
Decided to try this place out, after constantly going to another well known deli in the area. I wasn't impressed. The portions were large, but the meat tasted bland. They offered no pickles with your deli sandwich (probably had to order separately). Tried their desserts and was quite impressed with their cannoli's. They were very delicious. Also tried their tiramisu, carrot cake and fudge cake. All were good. I might come back when the other deli is too busy.</Review>

Generous portions, huge menu with things you can’t get anywhere else, and amazing deserts.

Authentically Manhattan Deli, sometimes including the attitude! But don’t worry, they’re softies inside, just like some of their deserts!<//Text>

This spot knows how to do REAL sandwiches and the bakery items are superb.  I got the French Dip, the au jus is full of flavor, beef was tender and delicious, and the steak fries are a must! The black and white cookie is massive in size and absolutely delightful, soft and delicious.  If you're in the area, you have to check this place out.< /review>

The options here are endless! Over 100 sandwich and breakfast options. The also have a pastry case and deli counter. Quality of the meats is very good here but a bit salty. Overall had a great lunch here, not full five stars because the interior was worn out and could be cleaner. Ask for any condiments you would like when ordering as the sandwiches are served dry.</Text>

I live in Las Vegas and our friends introduced us to Manhattan about 11 years ago when they lived in Palm Springs. Now they live in Pomona and had a hankering for Matzo Ball Soup which was funny because my husband and I had been talking about it not too long ago. After a phone call and email,  we found out they had outdoor dining, we hopped in the car just to go get soup!!! It is seriously some of the best matzo ball soup we have had and it was worth the drive. We even ordered some to go for our son who also loves it, but wasn't with us. Corned beef sandwich was so tender as usual. But the soup, oh man.</text>

<review>Made reservations, arrived a little early. Was not a problem. We picked outside such a lovely night.
We decided because of the traffic noise we would pick inside next time. Greeter, server, set up lady were all very gracious did there jobs with expertise and very accommodating.  I look forward to bringing friends back to the Manhattan.< /review>< Gmap_id>

My son first took me to Manhattans about 15-20 years ago. I never had kosher food although I had read and heard about it. no artificial flavors are ingredients all natural and fresh products. It was like learning to eat all over. I'm sorry but the dessert really got me, real cream whipped and sweet. Real puff pastry. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We both had Reuben sandwiches and they were great. Every time we go we try something different and this last time was no exception. Although we had to take it to go.<//review>

<Review>Ahhh Manhattan's in the desert! What a treat! I've enjoy many meals here and last visit no exception. I always love the BBQ Ribs...how amazing! But, last visit they were out of a few favs....and had to select another. Always true to be a great restaurant and wonderful staff. They have done some remodeling and it looks really nice. It's always a great choice for many items...and don't forget dessert....they have an awesome selection to cure and sweet tooth!!!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Date>1572365552472< /Date><rate>4< /rate><Review>Great New York deli in palm Springs. Great staff, (Claudia). I ordered the rueben with pastrami and corned beef, with a side of fries. The sandwich was very tasty, but I was disappointed by the amount of meat on it. I looked at pictures of the food before going in and felt the amount on mine, vs the pictures was lacking. That won't dissuade me from going again. I also order a slice of cake, to go. It was HUGE. They had to slice it in order to get into the containers. It tasted very good too.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Excellent food with massive portions. You'll get at least two meals out of your sandwich. The desserts are inhumanly large - we got eight servings out of a single piece of carrot cake.
The menu is similarly massive, with pretty much everything you've ever seen on a deli menu.</review><gmap_id>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d</gmap_id><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGnfgTT_x0v9PmuDdo0oLD_t9XwOWdv0CCw4-i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrp0XoW2z992eN1mM3LVHfEp4dEG8twahphgSJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Time>

Manhattan in the desert has it all for a deli experience..  The staff is exceptional and always friendly the sandwiches are out of this world.. Cindy at the dessert and togo counter is so very nice and efficient. She really embodies the image that matches the fun vibe of Manhattan in the Desert... and if you're not in the mood for sandwich their burgers are amazing and their breakfast is incredible. I can't say enough good things about this place and it's a lot of fun<//text>

Second time back this trip. Great friendly service. We had a French dip and a Manhattan foot long all beef Frank with homemade chilli and cheese on top. Both meals were amazing yummy. We also had Pepsi for our drinks. Don't forget to get your homemade desserts on your way out. Cheese cake best in town. Enjoy.<//text>

Whenever I visit the Coachella Valley, I make it a point to stop in and get my NY deli "fix" here at Manhattan in the Desert. Hands down the BEST deli style establishment. Yay for the pickles and kraut (better than the "other deli" in town. If you want to enjoy a sampler plate...opt for the tuna and egg salad combo with potato salad, cole slaw, and fresh veggies. Don't miss the pastrami or the rueben!!</text>

Amazing food and portions! You must absolute ask for the pickles at the table and try the sour tomatoes. I asked for my potatoes to be extra crispy and they delivered. You are gonna love the latkes, the grilled breakfast sandwiches, and the bagel and lox! Also, try the bakery items, they are very inventive and tasty.<//review>

Food is amazing. I was at a party that catered in fact. The staff is actually really friendly, but my rating is based on the lady we had. I think she was just ready for the day to over. It is really pricey though and normally I don't worry about thinks like that, but a sandwich is average 15-17 bucks here.</text>

<review>Lookie here lookie here! This place right here, now I cant speak on the rest the food but the desserts!? Theyre amazing. Stopped by twice so far since Ive been in Palm Springs these couple weeks to grab a dessert to go. The cheesecake slices are huge, about the size of a grown man fist! I cut it into quarters to eat it. The flavor is amazing, the presentation is wonderful. Establishment is clean and the staff is friendly. Definitely a recommended place on my list for places to go in Palm Springs.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
I've frequented this restaurant for 2.5 years. And I've always ordered the same two dishes, either the huevos rancheros or the Cobb salad. During the pandemic I encountered a few mishaps when ordering orders to go which was absolutely fine considering the circumstances we were all facing. But today I was taken aback when I went to place my usual order but was told my substituting blue cheese for feta would be a $2 up charge... For cheese crumbles!! Never been charged for that in the past. Nor has any restaurant ever charged that much for a substitution for something as minor as cheese crumbles. And as a buyer of feta. From different regions, I can't imagine this restaurant having the very high end feta cheese to justify a $2 charge. So sadly I will not be returning any time soon. As a long time customer I felt insulted.< /Review>

Tasty, fresh but very overpriced! I would however go back because it's a lovely atmosphere. I got the veggie sandwich and loved it. The matzo ball soup was very bland. I got florentine cookies and cherry and apple turnovers to take home and they were  FABULOUS!!!</Review>

Not a Weight Watchers special. Service a little slow because of the crowd and staff ilness. A little on the steep side for what was served but tasty. Will return if in area again.</review>< pics>

Easy going and awesome foods 🕺 classic old school plam springs. NO OFFENCE but me and my girlfriend where the youngest people by 40 years and we're late 20's 😂 but was still cool. There is a small Jewish bakery in the front. Good alternative diner for a Sunday instead of queues for the "trendy" spots pffftt. Get the pancakes<//text>

It is a great place to fill up on deli fare. The sandwiches are huge so I suggest sharing unless you will eat the rest tomorrow. Friendly and affordable. No pretense<//Text>

Always a pleasure to experience that mighty-fine-authentic-deli feeling. From the tender brisket on the plate to the fresh bagels from the bakery, Manhattan has it going on.  Been here before, be back in future.</Review>

<Text>Manhattan's in the desert is a restaurant that specializes in Delicatessen Foods. They have a large menu and the portions tend to be on the generous side. The food there is usually pretty good and the service was very attentive. If you're looking 4 a scrumptious sandwich this would be the place to get it. The restaurant also has a bakery that tends to sell items that are on the very large size. If you're going for lunch or dinner make sure you ask the waiter to bring you out pickles. They have pickled tomatoes dill pickles and kosher style pickles. They also make delicious omelettes add egg dishes and french toast dishes. They have a lox and bagel plate that is quite good. Manhattan's in the desert is a good place for breakfast lunch or dinner.<//Text>< user>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>It wasn't what I expected (no fault of the restaurant's). Food: the fries were lousy; the French dip was marginal. My wife had blueberry pancakes and said they were delicious. We had a brownie sundae, which was huge, enough for four people. We took home more than half of it. Service: they were very busy - it's obviously a popular place - and badly understaffed. As a result, service was slow. I haven't been back, so I've no way of knowing if that's the norm.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Staying in PS n drove by a couple of times. So we stopped.  Service great, thank you Fuzzy.  From the host, server n to the table attendants was an A rating.  The cornbeef dinner w cabbage was an A+.  A must try.  A little pricey, pastrami sandwich was $17.99 but more than enough for 2 people. Was very entertained by a man n woman who both got the fish n chips.  The woman ate more than half n then complained about the the fish.  The man devoured his, but Fuzzy handle it well.  Even asked if she could get her something else.  Nope she was full at that point.  Yup, the woman just didn't want to pay.  What a scam. Why do people do that n 10 to 1 she didn't leave a tip. 😠  Fuzzy provided great service w a smile to that woman n her table of five.  A must try, huge variety of meals n desserts.<//review>< Pictures>

Step back in time to a previous era and imagine the dulcet tones of the Rat Pack complementing your cuisine. The MITD Diner has a super cool Neo-Retro Ambiance with a broad array of menu options-Kosher and Non to meet your gustatory requirements. Portions are large and are suitable for sharing. Our favourite breakfast in the desert.<//text>

So, we didnt call our  order in before getting their. It was Sunday(Father's Day). My dad's wife & I stopped in the afternoon and placed our order. A personal white pizza, pattymelt & a Reuben sandwich. The cook accidentally made a Hawaiin pizza. Well we dont eat pork so taking it its place was impossible. So we waited longer to get the right pizza. Because we had to wait (45 mins) we were given the Hawaiin pizza and an item from their bakery. The food and pastries ( we bought some sweets too) was delish! Only downfall was the wait time - regardless of the wrong pizza being made. Call first and order, check it before leaving & you'll  be more than satisfied. You'll  be Very happy with their food. A bit pricey but TOTALLY worth the $.< /review>

Food was good my first time having take out from this restaurant but next time I will be sitting down to enjoy the food.  The manager was very helpful because I was having a small issue getting out of my car..but she had her staff bring my order right out to me.. I would always give 5 stars because of the customer service A+++</text>

< Review>
Manhattan Deli is the best deli in the desert, hands down. They make all their meats fresh on the premises, which is one of the main reasons it's so superior to it's closest competitor. Their bakery and dessert items are also fresh and delicious. In the summertime they have several dinner specials for $12 or $13 - it can't be beat anywhere. Their portions are huge, I can only ever eat half and take the rest home, then I've got another full meal. Their staff is friendly and attentive, the restaurant has nice decor and a pleasant atmosphere. Conveniently located.<//Review>

<text>I really enjoy eating here whenever I am out in the low desert. The food is good, the portions are large, and the desert is the best I have had in Palm Desert. I recommend the Carrot Cake or Tiramisu. The only thing I think is a detractor is the menu. It is very large. Probably over 100 items. If you like options, you'll find them here. If you like simplicity, you're better off sticking to the larger chain restaurants.<//text>< pictures>

I felt like I was in an authentic NYC deli. A very extensive menu- breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, special plates. And you get to walk through their incredible bakery on your way to be seated! Very tempting. Portions are generous, staff very pleasant and attentive!<//Review>

Been dining here for quite a while and finally getting around to writing a review.  This is a great place for deli style food but for me, the best breakfast is the huevos rancheros.  What?  Yes, of all places, a NY style deli with a delicious Mexican style breakfast.  If you try it, beware of the jalapeno peppers on the side, they can be quite hot.  Service staff is always friendly and efficient, restrooms are clean and ample parking lot.  Bakery goods are also quite delicious if a bit pricey.<//text>

Great place for a bite IF: You are in no hurry. I’ve been here when it’s packed to being a ghost town. And the service takes FOREVER. Excellent food though. The knishes are fantastic HOWEVER, You might want to wait 10-15 minutes to eat it. It came out absolutely scorching hot, even blowing on a bite didn’t help.</Review>

This is like going in Manhattan and ordering at a Kosher Delicatessen, the pastries cheesecake all the food, everything is excellent.
YOU  can't get 4 in California light roast beef dippers all kinds of things just you have to go there and know it's not cheap. Jack in the Box is a real place I suspect they spend a lot of money on water treatment because their pastries are so light and fluffy they taste like they were made from water right out of the alleghenies.</Review>

<review>If you want AMAZING DELI food THIS is the place! We had breakfast- my husband ordered the "Pastrami and egg breakfast sandwich" on a bagel and it was HUGE! It was offered on 3  different types of bagels and my husband asked our server Felipe C for an alternative flavor and it was no problem! Then I thought I was going to be a real problem child when I gave Felipe my order. I wanted the "Tongue and egg" with hash browns but I really wanted it made hash style. I explained it to him and he told me it was absolutely no problem and my breakfast came out a beautifully cooked ""tongue hash".
The portion was huge and all at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!!!
This is the cutest spot, great attentive service with prices that are commensurate with the quality and quantity of the portions. I don't think they're overpriced at all. Just bring an appetite or take home a doggy bag!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

1st time here, recommended by a friend. Love the eclectic deco. Interesting dining room layout, broken into sections with different heights. Staff was friendly and service was good. Ordered an Italian sandwich and the deli meat was piled on high! and taste was flavorful. The french baguette was fresh and light. I didn’t have an opportunity to try any pastries but I will be back.</Text>

The service was FANTASTIC! We were seated quickly and the hostess was great! I had the hot pastrami and corned beef combo and it was delicious and pretty big. The deserts were very good as I took home the over sized Ding Dong, very tasty. I would highly recommend doing there and I will go back as I noticed other plates of food looked great as well. Thank you for a nice meal Manhattan in the Desert.</Text>

HUGE menu. That often means the place will have mediocre food, but this place seems to pull it off. Everything our party had was quite good< /review>

If you go to Sherman's you'll find that the people there are really friendly. If you disregard the the unfriendliness of the people working the counter this place is great.< /review>< GmapID>

Very big and good sandwiches. However the prices are really high! I got 2 sandwiches one for me and my partner at my work. It was over 50 dollars! Now it was very good and the portions well they was really really big. The customer service was so so. Not good not too bad. They also charge extra for every little thing want a yellow chili to go with you sandwich that will be an extra $2.25. Come on most place have that for free. So despite the good sandwich with large portions the price is really dam high for a sandwich.<//Text>

Love this place. Some of the cooks came from Canters in Los Angels. Great traditional delicatessen fare. The pastrami sandwiches are exceptional. Had breakfast recently, the latkes were perfect. I usually have the matzo ball soup -- which includes carrots. The pickle plate has pickled green tomatoes, unusual but still good.< /Text>

<review>Breakfast, for me the Last platter split with my dad, excellent bagel's, fresh veggies , came with coleslaw and potato salad, all was good.
The location is wrong for this place but this property is in a nice setting. Beats the PD location by a mile, much better.</review>< Date>

Staff started to be very attentive until we place our orders.  Coffee hit the spot and the refills they kept coming.  After waiting 20 min plus other guest were being served excepts us. Finally I said to the server what happen to our order. He said I will Check n find out. We got our food most of it was already cold.  I jus wanted to get out of there. My first time being here n service was really bad.< /review>

<Review>I have been going here for years, it never disappoints. The menu is diverse, food fresh and prepared to perfection. The staff is well-trained and actually check to see if all is okay.  There is always enough food left for me to take  home for a second meal.  They also have their own bakery which is the best in the West.< /Review>< Response>

Although this is a long time, well established restaurant here, tonight was the first time I went after all these years visiting and living here.
The service was outstanding and very personable - I loved my waitress. The food was good with large portions. Plenty of parking. On a Saturday night, at 6:30 pm, in the middle of 113° heat, the place wasn't completely full but almost.
I had clipped a $11.99 summer dinner coupon that motivated me to come by. However, it was part of their normal menu, but no big deal. I'm sure they will continue for the remainder of the summer season.
Large and varied menu that should handle most people.
I ordered the turkey dinner which came with soup or salad, roast turkey slices, and two vegetable sides for $11.99. Drink was extra. As I said earlier, the portions were very generous and I left stuffed. However, I couldn't resist getting a Key Lime Bar to go. With tax and tip, the total was under thirty.
A couple of weeks ago I went to Sherman's, which is surprisingly similar in every way. However, of the two, the food and service at Manhattan was much better. Cost was the same for their dinner special.
With Manhattan's other restaurant in Palm Desert closing recently, for which I hadn't heard anything good about, I was hesitant to come here. But not now as I look forward to coming back soon.
Definitely a place I would recommend.< /text>

<Review>Food wasn't as good as I remember it being. Steak was full of fat and cold by the time it was delivered. Waitress never bought deli pickles until we asked the busser to bring us some. The bathrooms were clean. There was ants crawling all over our table. Don't know if I'll go back but we went for a birthday party.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is a winner every time.  Huge varied menus, great value on the whole as portions are enough for 2 meals. Get a take out box! Summer menu is always superb value when low season and desert heat kicks in - but you have to ask for that menu! A Palm Springs tradition- Manhattan Deli!!</review>

<Review>Great New York style eatery.  Lots of options.  Perhaps too many...
Food-wise:  You can never go wrong with a salad or sandwich, which are all HUGE.  Dinners are very traditional.  No frills or surprises.  What lacks in quality is made up for in quantity.  And don't be afraid to customize or specify preferences.  They are awesome with getting you exactly what you want.
Desserts often look better than they taste, unfortunately.  Most are quite dense and all are served cold.  Carrot Cake is always a win though and a cinnamon roll ONLY IF you eat it there, but be sure to order it warmed with extra icing.  Otherwise they are typically pretty dry.
Last, whether you dine-in or take-out, don't forget to ask for pickles, which are hommade and served with homemade pickled green tomatoes and sauerkraut.
Expect dinner to run $30 a head inclusive of t&t.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Great menu and awesome service. The French bread pizza with pepperoni was amazing. I could’ve just eaten a bunch of those for my entree. Fortunately I ordered the country fried steak and it was delicious and hearty. Big portion! I was pleasantly surprised. The fettuccine alfredo was bland and liquidy, not how it’s supposed to be at all and that was a huge portion as well. I wish we could’ve tried some dessert, but maybe we won’t fill up on silly entrees next time.<//Review>< UserId.>

The hamburgers were not cooked to the proper doneness ... the 7 layer cake had too much icing and not enough cake

<Text>Bits of boiled meat in the veggies and bugs in the take-away box.

This place is only good if all you care about is large amounts of cheap food.  Servings are massive and inexpensive but of poor quality.  This place used to be great.  Last night I got the “steamed vegetables” because I thought it would be safe (I’ve lost confidence in the food prep quality) but when I started to eat them, they tasted like beef.  Then I found little grey bits of boiled meat all over everything.  Disgusting. No wonder they want to smoother everything in cheese and butter.  When I told the waitress she could have cared less and still charged me even though I sent it back.  Bad.  Then my son got a take-away box and there were BUGS in it.  Come on guys.  Last time we’ll ever go there.</Text>< pics>

Always enjoy a great meal. Waitress turned a negative into a positive as I awaited my bill and credit card return. She apologized and stated she had been sent to open another room which caused the delay. Appreciated her explanation and the meal was fantastic< /text>

<Review>Visited this very fine Jewish Deli on numerous occasions.  Food is consistently excellent with exceedingly generous portions. Arrive after 4:00 P M ask for their early bird menu where very satisfying offerings are just $12.95! Cliff is hands down the most accommodating and gracious server in California!</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><GmapID>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d</GmapID>< Resp>

<Review>Staff is excellent... food is reasonably priced .. I eat here a lot , but unfortunately it’s usually after 7 pm .... because of this 75% of the time the vegetables are way over cooked and are inedible... they need to work on this ..

Service is usually good.

Give it a try. A tourist place for sure.

Great wait staff. Great food. Great selection. The menu was huge with options from cultures all over the world. The server noticed that a guests lasagna was a bit overcooked and took it back to redo with out hesitation. I didn't try any, but the cakes and pastries looked great as well. The prices were more than reason at about $15 a plate on average. My family and I had a great time here.</review>

Clean, good service, good food, good prices, easy parking. Bring your dog and sit on the patio. Much like the Jewish restaurants on Manhattan's lower East side.< /text>

An acceptable deli with acceptable food. Nothing I have had was bad, but nothing made me say "wow"  either. Definitely worth mentioning that they serve very big sandwiches, much more that you would expect to get. What raises this place above a three star rating is the generous portions and the consistent professional service. I don't come here often, but I am usually not disappointed.</Text>

<Review>I've been coming to Manhattan's since I moved to the desert and it's still one of my favorite places.  To be fair, not every item on the menu is a smash hit, but with such a huge menu it's not hard to find favorites that you want to eat time and time again.  The pastrami is fantastic.  And the carrot cake never lets you down.</Review><rating>5</rating>< Time>

Last month corned beef and pastrami were excellent as was the service.  Last night waiters were to busy talking in the kitchen to take orders.  At this visit corned beef and pastrami were very fatty and gristle.  Also kishka was burnt.  The burnt kishka was ordered as an appetizer and got there last.
Think we will try a different deli next time< /Review>

<Review>It's on the must visit list when in Palm Springs. You know as soon as you walk in there's something good going on here. Also, that you better be careful ordering. The pastries are excellent, and huge. Most of the food orders are as well.
This place fulfills my needs for a good pastrami or reuben sandwich. The French Drip with brisket is first rate. The patty melt is worth trying. The complimentary plate of pickles is usually fantastic. Service is paced well for visiting with friends, and that's the best thing to do here. Bring friends. Otherwise, it could be a bit slow. I've not had a problem.
You can make reservations. They join the mid century modern aesthetic with local sensibilities and the New York deli together perfectly.<//Review>< gmap_id>

I've eaten here once before for dinner and I remember that it was delicious. Breakfast was no different! Our server was Luis; he answered our questions and helped us figure out what we wanted to choose from the huge variety of menu items. He was also very funny and extremely mindful of checking up on us and asking us how we were doing. The food came out quickly and it tasted spectacular! And as we were leaving, people wished us well and thanked us for coming. Very friendly staff, great food, and a wonderful restuarant. I can see why this place is always a little busy: it's incredible!< /text>

I am so disappointed that this once thriving Restaurant has lost it's former owners who were very generous to an owner who doesn't care about the Palm Springs Store anymore.    And with Kim, the former Manager gone, it's not a good place to eat for many locals.  They opened a new store in Palm Desert and I think they put much more effort into that particular store.  Used to practically live at Manhattan, but now may go once every eight months.  This last visit was our last.< /Text>

<review>Great variety, good food.  Some items are a bit pricey, and others are a good deal. Service is usually fast and efficient, but can vary by server.  Beer prices are reasonable.  Can get really packed during peak dinner time, especially during early bird.<//review>< pictures>

The Turkey is one of my favorite dinners, however not if it is dry. It should be moist and the veggies slightly al dente....It sounds like we dropped the ball on this evening.

I ORDERED THE STUFFED SLIED INTO WEGES WITH HEAPING SCOOPS OF CHICKEN SALAD BEING SOME EATERIES DO NOT PAY ATTENTION WHEN SOMEONE SAYS NO FRESH/RAW ONIONS THEN HAD 4 LARGE ADDITIONAL TOMATOE RINGS ONTOP OF LARGE LEAF LETTUCE AND FRESH DISH OF FRUIT & COTTAGE CHEESE FOR AROUND 15.00. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ME ON CACATION, I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A ADAPTER CAR PLUG POWERED COOLER SO I CAN TAKE MY UNDINISHED MEAL.< /Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Interesting and tasty spins on a lot of standard favorites, like Huevos Rancheros. They add a stack of frizzled ham and cheese over the corn tortillas, then cover with sauce and eggs, along with the refried beans. Very enjoyable. Same twists go for their French Toast Monte Christo; so good! The menu has a broad selectiin. Be forewarned, portions are large. All the better to take a doggie bag for an later snack.

We ate there 4 times during our visit. Each time the food was served timely, by friendly and helpful servers, and was very tasty! We also partook of some of the bakery goods; also delicious! Their deli offers some hard to find delicacies. We loved their homemade pickled and sauerkraut.

They also feature interesting art works. Heard several customers inquiry after the work.

Only thing that kept me from giving five stars was I noticed the window sills next to the booths were in need of dusting.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is the best ! You will find their menu has such a wide variety, you will not have a problem finding a favorite, and in your price range.
The service here goes over and beyond, they even asked if we would like a drink to go,  pouring us a fresh drink in a to go cup.

Service is excellent and their crew is on top of making sure you have your drinks right away.  We always had more than enough food and had to take some home - for later.

Friendly staff and good quality food. I had the lox plate. A good portion. The salmon was buttery. The cream cheese wasn't hard from refrigeration.  Generous quantity of capers. And a pickle plate!<//Review>

I saw the ad on TV and not knowing what I wanted for dinner it was perfect timing. Quality food. Portions are as expected for a NY style deli. Staff needs to learn a bit more about the menu. A critical point was though the order was filled correctly, the order taker had the incorrect side on the receipt. If I did not hear the order filler say the wrong side, I would have been disappointed. I would eat here again.< /text>

We were a large group with split checks, 18% gratuity added, no problem. However a service fee of about $2.50 a person added to the bill, wrong. Food prepared and served very well.</text>

Why are they so popular?  I've tried them a few times now and I just can't see it.  Compared to other places like Sherman's or It's a Deli they just don't compare on every level.  The staff is not very cordial, the seating is in terrible shape.  And yes I'm going to say it, cleanliness is always questionable, it never feels clean.  For me I just can't get past the fact that the floor/carpeting is so dirty your feet stick to it.  So my advice is if you venture in just don't look down......<//Review>

<text>Great food can be found there. The deserts are even better. The service is nice and friendly. I've not had to wait to be seated, though I do suggest that you call just incase there is seating available for when your like to dine, though more often than not you should be fine.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Ordered reubens for 2 of us and Philly cheese for another.
The reubens were really hard to eat , the crust areas on both sandwiches were as hard as a rock 1 inch in from the edge. Server said they might have double baked the rye bread.........WHAT!......Philly was pretty good,
$17 to $18 each sandwich with fries is not worth the fare that was served.</review>< pics>

It was good food but, a little bit too pricey for the quality of food. I'll go back to try one of the deserts I saw behind the glass in the front waiting area cuz, the lunch bill was too much to include the dessert and I would love to have tried their carrot cake it looked sooo delicious< /Text>

<review>My parents have been coming here for years, bragging about the size of the food. Without using hyperbole, these are the biggest deli sandwiches in Palm Springs and the surrounding areas. The the bread is great and soaks up the meat nicely. The #39 is corned beef and pastrami, it is ridiculous. So good. The mish mash soup is incredible and the eclairs are to die for.<//review>< pics>

Service was great. Asked if we wanted drinks within 2 minutes of sitting down and the drinks were on the table in under 5 minutes. My wife had the steak sandwich which she said was excellent. 8 ounce Ribeye on a roll with fries. it looked good too.
I had the super combo Pastrami, Turkey and Corned Beef on Rye. All you could taste was the turkey but the worst part was the bread tasted like it had been thawed out in the Microwave. the center of the bread was ice cold and the rest was hard and dry like what happens when you microwave something 10 seconds too long. I have read that this place was starting to go cheap to keep the prices down but when you truly skip on quality and get caught..................I'll go elsewhere. I would say even though my wife loved her sandwich, mine was the worst sandwich I ever have had. I'll drive by next time.</text><Date>1423860041757</Date><GmapID>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d< /GmapID><rate>2<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Had lunch  right after driving 8 hours from fremont. The rueben sandwich is off the chain. Real fresh juicy meat. And the sourdough bread is amazing aswell. The place was super clean and staff were friendly and professional.<//review>

This is my favorite restaurant in Palm Springs. When I'm lucky enough to be in Palm Springs, I have to stop at Manhattans. I've tried several items off the menu and I've never been let down. Go hungry tho, the portions are huge. And one tip, when you go, don't leave without a piece of carrot cake. Get it to go.< /review>

I've been pleased here before yet the place is going downhill. 20 minutes to get our meal in a restaurant that's basically empty and the wait staff look miserable and seemed detached and inattentive. The little girls serving us look like she needed to be at High School mean girl class. The carpet has got so much grease and grime in it from 15 years of traffic. It's sad that this place is not doing so well. The food was okay<//Review>

Fabulous!  Better bring your appetite!  The portions are unbelievable, and if you want a little to take home for later, there may be enough for one or two more meals.
Great All American, Jewish,  German and delightful bakery goods...oh, don't forget their wonderful coldslaw!</review>

The food is not worth the price.  After three tries, I doubt I'll return if I have any say in the matter.

Update 1/20/20: the personal pizza is excellent.  I still am not impressed with the quality/price of the rest of the menu.</text>

Picked up matzo ball soup on 10/1/18. We both got very sick the day after severely. Went to the doctor today and found out that it's bacteria infection. Now, we have to deal with the long treatment and hopefully recovery.< /text>

Huge New York style menu with something for everyone. Personally, I am drawn to restaurants that reflect the local experience,  but the name says it all, if you want a New York-type diner, this fits the bill!</review>

Great place. Went with my sister and my two children 4 and 8. They were really good with the kids and it was loud enough to where the kids didn't annoy anyone but not loud enough for it was annoying to adults. The pastrami sandwich was to die for not fatty and chewy but really good.< /Review>

This review if for the Highway 111 location -  not the Palm Canyon (unfortunately, they don't appear to have their Google+ page set up for the Highway 111 venue as of yet).

Discovered this place by accident while driving down Hwy 111. Being a native New York, I of course noticed the word "Manhattan" right away and was intrigued by the prospects of "Manhattan in the Desert".  Stopped in with family for lunch and was not disappointed!  The decor is upscale casual with very comfortable booths.  Large black and white vintage prints of NY scenes hang on the walls.  The menu is huge! Took 10 minutes just to make a decision!  Decided to go with a classic Ham, Salami and Swiss sandwich on rye with side of potato salad.  The sandwich size matched the menu - again, huge!  Delicious.  Also, they have a bakery with assorted rugala and my favorite, huge black and white cookies!  Terrific place with friendly staff as was the manager, Itai was very friendly and grateful for our business.  Will be sure to visit again next time I'm in the desert!< /review>

Not the friendliest staff. Especially the woman at the deli counter. Always feel like I'm putting her out.
However the host and cashier are fine.</Text>

<rating>2<//rating><text>This is the second time we have eaten lunch in Manhattan in the Desert and the second time we were disappointed. This time around it appears the restaurant has been updated with new upholstery and some artwork but the quality if the food and taste remains unchanged, disappointing. The service was at best fair, no attention to customer needs or satisfaction and inattentive. Had to wave down a bussboy twice to get the waiters attention. The pastrami sandwich was way too fatty, I like the meat juicy and of course expect a little fat to keep it moist and most of all tasty, but this second visit produced the same disappointing lunch, tastless pastrami. There are two N.Y. type delis in the desert, as of now there is only one TRUE, New York deli (take it from this long time New Yorker who's eaten the real deal for thirty plus years) and that's Sherman's. I like the one located in Palm Desert better than the one in Palm Springs. We'll never give Manhattan another chance.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I was pleases to try this restaurant in the desert. They have a fun twist on horderves, PICKLES!

Maybe I just haven't been to a Kosher restaurant before, but it was a nice twist. I am learning that eating a little fermented foods before the meal- aid's in the digestion. So happy to get a great meal, nice service, plus a lagre display of beautiful desserts in the case- as we leave.

They do have non Kosher meats, for those looking for a ham sandwich or sausage.</Review>< UserId.>

A bit pricey for the basic quality of food, which is slightly better than most local restaurants of its kind. If you're not super hungry or not just craving deli food, I think there's more interesting local menus for similar $$$. And, sometimes the deli vibe isn't working at all for me even when the craving is strong, that's when I LOVE their #takeaway to eat at home.</Review>

< review>
When I walked in no one greeted me. I saw someone who looked like a Hostess and a server talking, whispering to each other, giggling. They did see me but they continued to talk amongst themselves. I stood there politely waiting and then they said, "oh are you with those other people just go over there". Then they went back to talking. When it was seated at the table with my friends a man who look like he could be a server or waiter waltzed in with an air of authority threw a stack of napkins down on the table and walked around looking us over did not announce himself great us welcome us or anything. In fact I really look like we were interrupting their day. My friends ordered their meal and or dessert and I wanted some soup. I looked at the choices of soup I did not want to eat meat there was a choice of chicken broth with different choices. I chose the chicken broth with the vegetables. The server stated the only vegetable that they could put in there was carrots. I said all right that would be fine. When my soup arrived it was lukewarm in temperature. The Taste was closer to slightly salted tap water really no flavor at all. And there were beautiful carrots floating in the lukewarm water. I told the server that did not want the soup as there was no flavor to it and it wasn't hot.  The soup was taken away immediately and I was not charged. Overall our group was happy with there desserts that they boxed up themselves. The only real good service that we received was from a delightful young man, it was the busboy. I definitely would never go there again and I would never recommend it to anyone.<//review>

Clean place have to be honest I was expecting something different ...
Little bit more fancier but was pretty average from customer service and food was delicious but we way to long to get our food on top of that my waitress forgot pretty much everything she was back and forth getting my order right..</text>

Truely Manhatten in the desert!  Shades of Katz's and the now defunct Carnegie with the addition of diner fare as well.  I asked for a small Pastrami dandwich, and still had to ask for two slices of rye bread to take half the Pastrami with us.  It took two of my cousins to finish it, with gusto.  Definitely worth your while to go out of your way to eat here!</Text>

Endless menu options including traditional Jewish and other deli items plus a variety of baked goods and breakfast all day. I've enjoyed almost everything I've tried here and we sometimes order to go through Postmates.</Review>

Great meats and yummy sides, but the bread can be mediocre. Massive servings for the sandwiches ... But you certainly pay for it in terms of cost and limited included sides. Still, all in all, very good.<//text>

<rate>1</rate><review>Had the Corn beef sandwich  and soup.  Corn beef was so greasy and fat I complained to the waitress who was rude and said…..well corn beef is a fatty meat……perhaps I should direct her to a few GOOD places to eat.  Complained to the manager and he acted like they were doing me some kind of favor to even let me eat there.  To top things off I went home and vomited and  hugged the porcelain for 4 hours.  This place is a joke.  I am sure the Reviews must be written by relatives here.  They advertise on TV over and over again.  That should tell you how bad it is !!!!!  My advise,

Eh. This place isn't very good. Pastrami was super dry. Rye bread was mediocre at best. Cleanliness was questionable. I wanted to like this place, buy sadly I didn't. I won't be returning.</review>

Consistent good food, can get pricey- deli turkey sandwich w/cheese and steak fries  can push $20. Service is very inconsistent- sometimes good, sometimes horrible. Greeter (young, tall guy) is oblivious and very self-absorbed. Lose the attitude. Locals in the summer keep you in business.< /Review>

The pastrami was definitely worthy and I appreciated it more on a french roll than rye. The deserts were huge beyond measure and seemed a little like they has been in the refrigerator case too long.<//Text>

They were out of Baked Potatoes for the 5th time we have gone there last night as well as the special Prime Rib, it was only 7:30. I wonder how many times they been out of Baked Potatoes when we were not there !
This alone is one thing but we are a group that goes there several times a week and at least once a week 10 + strong, it was the attitude of the manager that really upset us, we walked out and will not go back., she could care less !

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>With the disappearance act that most jewish delis around the country are suffering from..that is not holding true for the palm springs area. Theve got 2 Manhattans and a Sherman's. I can walk to the Manhattans in palm springs. As a deli addict I can tell you the food stacks up big time here at Manhattans. Soup..corned beef..pickles..its all here and all excellent.. I get my fix now 2x a week and all I can say is whew..its about time. Living up in Colorado with no deli for 8 years..pure torture. Now if they can just get that 7 layer cake down like I had when we were kids then we really would have deli here on earth....😍 from the professional palate of cheffrey.<//Review>< pictures>

the menu is rather larger than it should be.   the food is really mediocre.   the Napoleon had too much gelatin in the Bavarian cream.   it was like eating rubber.  I paid 699 for that thing!</Text>

Way over rated, prices are way too high. Just another restaurant living on the idea of being seen here matters. Food is o.k. but not exceptional for the prices.< /review>
