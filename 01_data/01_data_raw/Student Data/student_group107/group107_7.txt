The pizza was really tasty. The family really enjoyed them both. Loved how the crust had just enough crunch. Pizza sauces were really good and the toppings were cut small and not overweighing the pizza slices< /review>

Family owned, support your local small businesses! Great service and delicious take and bake pizza, calzones, sweets, salads & beverages! Always greeted with a smile and a conversation, we need more businesses like this and with this type of hospitality! If you ever see a bad review on this place, it's probably just some oddball who doesn't think pineapple belongs on pizza! This place is awesome!<//text>

Just stopped in for the 1st time. Staff was super friendly and welcoming. Pizza is off the hook plus they have other menu items. I love that they have cauliflower crust!!! Plus, their prices are so good!</Text>

If you love pizza you have to try the cauliflower crust here, it is fantastic! The crust has a nice crisp and a great chew to it. I prefer it over any other pizza in town.< /Review>

<Text>Okay so I'm one who loves mountain mike's and i recently went on keto, so I decided to try this place based on reviews (and their cauliflower crusted pizza). Let me tell you, I'm a huge foodie so some keto foods are not the best tasting but the pizza did NOT taste like cauliflower at all. Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! Family owned business and they're super friendly and down to earth. I will be going back for years to come and ditching the national chain. Hands down best pizza I've ever tasted AND it's HEALTHY! Craving definitely satisfied!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I'm boring. I like a basic cheese pizza. I love it. It's the only pizza my wife will eat and we have literally tried every one in town . Nice friendly staff. I do wish they opened earlier though so I could have some for lunch.</text>< gmapID>

The pizza here taste delicious and fills you up! I got the Popeye Pizza which is a great option for VEGETARIANS! It has spinach, tomatoes, artichokes, olives and mushrooms. IT WAS SO GOOD! Really low prices for everything too. I’ll definitely be back!<//text>

The variety of pizza options is enough for anyone! They also have a dough free splat "pizza"... the best part of a pizza without the carbs if that's your thing! They also make portobello mushroom cap pizzas! Aside the food, the owner Bryan is a down to earth family man fighting the good fight... Always down to support local businesses with good people and good service!</review>

BEST!! Take-n-Bake in Modesto Hands down! Very nice place, great service. Quick and easy, only downside is parking isn’t the best, but is absolutely worth it. He uses baking paper with the dough, no corn meal or tons of powder. Generous toppings, easy menu, and awesome tasting pizza, great deserts.  As I said, best Take-n-bake in Modesto....  you really gotta give this place a try, supporting the little guy tastes so good.< /review>

Donatello's is a great take & bake pizzeria! The staff is very friendly. They treat each customer like they are friends. They have many different specialty pizzas and calzones. Their ingredients are super fresh and their pizza sauce is delicious! They also make an incredible stuffed Portobello mushroom. They have pizza cookies and brownies for dessert and have really good salads too. The chicken Caesar salad is delicious. Donatello's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.</Text>

The guys working were super friendly, we ordered 3 different pizzas all with different type of sauce. So here's my review. I will never get take and bake anywhere else. Sauses were amazing, all other ingredients were freash, they don't skimp on what they give you. New customer for life!<//Review>

No idea why this place has such good reviews. The staff are very friendly, I think that's about all this location has going for it. Otherwise it's kind of a dump.

Rain leaks damaged property in my unit and water collects on the floors and hallways. Homeless sleep in their units and in cars on the property. Elevators are consistently broken. You always have to get staff to unchain carts because the homeless will steal them otherwise. Pre-Covid, you had to leave your ID to get a cart and the office worker disappeared for the day, forcing me to come back another day to get my driver's license.< /review>

My brother G Jenkins has a storage here n the powers that be have rainded down on him like crazy but in the midst of it all i can truly say that the staff n in perticular the property manager shut up Cynthia have been amazing and helping to navigate through this very very tough time not only hasn't been a blessing doing business but it is something that is almost out of body and are rewarding that these people go out of their way to help in the ways that they do and he and I and the rest of our family is particularly grateful thank you< /review>

Cynthia is SUPER NICE!!! . She helped me with my storage and walked me through everything on the iPad. She took time to explain where the room is so I wouldn't get lost. I thank her for her patience because I asked alot of questions< /Review>

I had to move and need a quick place to store items. I live near fashion district and this is closes to me, the location could be better because of homeless. The staff is super friendly, Cynthia made me feel at ease putting my things in this storage. She helped me find the perfect size for my things on such short notice and gave me half of to help for the first month. Place is clean on the inside and it's pretty big, a lot of moving trucks fit inside the parking lot. Cynthia even suggested a great place to eat near by, she's such a sweetheart and I love her name..lol<//review>

The customer service was poor .

My storage was broke into I believe this was management master key insurance cannot recover my belongings I will be taking this matter to court !

My parents are not here I had things I can’t never get back from the heartbreak of memories I’m very disappointed is this matter.

Ps:When I told the workers my storage was broke into they continue they’re conversation on the phone like I was invincible very rude!<//Text>

Horrible customer service.  No one smiles here. Everyone seems on the edge. The friendliest person is the Manager who needs to hire more customer reps with her personality. Won't use this location again.</Text>

<Review>Great space, great price, excellent service. Cynthia helped me, showed me the space and made all the best recommendations for packing. She is the absolute best! I would give her 10 stars if I could. She has given me peace of mind in this process and made me feel very secure. She was courteous, professional, honest and highly efficient. Thank you, Cynthia and Public Storage!</Review>< pictures>

She never gave me attitude even after not being able to get a storage unit that day. The place is pretty big and she gave me a tour and showed me how to work the elevator and how to use my code. Highly recommend Kelsy.<//review>< resp>

The Public Storage team at this facility is so kind and helpful with finding your every need! This was my families first time looking for storage and we were happy to be assisted by Jared and Cynthia. My experience was a 5/5 thanks to their great customer service, however, I am only deducting 1 star due to the current technical issues regarding their elevators. Thankfully the team assured me it was a minor issue and we were able to store without any hassle! Thanks again, Jared and Cynthia!< /text>

Outstanding customer service! I highly recommend this place. All my questions were answered in the best way possible and that was all thanks to Francisco and the bushy hair guy who's name I can't spell. Francisco service was so amazing I have to give him a review. I walked in and he greeted me with a warm smile and greeting. Come to this place and ask for Francsico and the bushy hair guy you won't regret it.< /review>

<Text>The service at this public storage is great, Cynthia, Carla and Francisco are always really helpful and friendly. All the staff is really good at answering all your questions and they do so in an amiable manner. The area is really convenient for me and they have several unit sizes from which you can chose. I rented two units and so far no problems for me. I highly recommend this location for all your storage needs.< /Text>< time>

<text>I am moving out and went to go ask about pricing at this location . Cynthia not only showed me the perfect size for all of my stuff but she offered the space with a 50% off discount and with the money I saved I was able to buy the bags she recommended to keep my bed safe. Cynthia is very friendly and this company needs to give her a raise.< /text>< Name>

Hi! I stop by earlier today to window shop and the employees there Francisco and Susana were incredible! They showed me around and make sure I was fully informed. The only reason I didn't rented was because I ain't moving from my place until two month from now and I have found my place to store my things. Thank you Public Storage!<//review>

< review>
I walked in earlier this afternoon to the facility in San Pedro with a friend looking for a unit to rent out. I'm not from LA so I was skeptical on what I could find to hold my things for a reasonable price.  We were promptly addressed by a woman named Carla at the counter. She was genuine in her greeting and insisted that had there been any questions that arose that we not hesitate to ask. We had been to other facilities but seeing as this was a pretty big store we had asked if we could take a look at one of the units, hence I wasn't too sure if I was ready to rent one at this facility or even rent a unit at all. Carla was able to relate to us on a personal level and kept her explanations short and to the point. Since I'm from Alaska, I was planning on transitioning over to LA but wanted to make sure I had everything in check for myself. I also was a bit worried with what I need such as extra boxes. Carla reassured me that they happen to have boxes at a decent price as well if I happened to run into trouble needing things to make the haul of the load somewhat better. Carla was very knowledgeable, respectable, helpful, kind, genuine, and not to mention hilarious. Not only did she have us to deal with but all the while busy with answering phone calls and other customers in such a professional manner. I was highly impressed with her talent for multitasking at such a quick pace, ( A comment my friend also mentioned to me) Her customer service was pure excellence. It's very rare to find great customer service like hers where everything just flows naturally. When we were finished with our visit Carla walked us out the store with such a warm smile and ended the day with mentioning how their doors would always be open to us if there were anymore questions or interests. Thanks to Carla and her wonderful service, she's made my decision on moving to LA a quick and easy one especially on where to rent out a space and given me the influence to constantly return to the facility and to share it with many other people. Thanks Carla so much, you're awesome :)</review>

I want to rent a space and even though the prices are a bit high for me and unfortunately I’m not renting her service was so amazing I have to give her a review. In a few months I’ll be moving and just asking around for prices. From the moment I walked it she greeted me with a warm smile and kept it the whole time. I really appreciate the attention she gave me and how much she knew about the renting business. She answered every question I had and I just might return to rent with her even though prices are a bit high. Thanks Cynthia you’re amazing.<//Text><resp>None</resp>< name>

<user_name>Sandi Pacheco</user_name><Text>I walked into the store on San Pedro and was immediately greeted by Paul the property manager. What drew me to this store was the amazing reviews I read on google. So I went to inquire on spaces at this location because I'm moving to the downtown area and found out that right now is not a great time to rent due to high prices and no promos. But due to the amazing customer service that Paul provide by giving me a great tour of the property and answering all my questions. I will be storing here soon sometime this year thanks Paul we need more people like you.<//Text><date>1500528523889<//date>< rate>

I am definitely coming back to get a storage and with this type of customer service I will make sure to tell my friends and family that need a storage. The way Susana took it beyond hopefully management is looking at this and give her a raise plus a pat in the back as we need more people this responsibility,respectful, and enthusiastic<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Sandra provided excellent customer service while trying to get a storage space. She let me view the space even before I finalized anything to make sure I was pleased.
Romeo was also very helpful. He made sure we were taken care of and feel comfortable with leaving our space there.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2c7d47618d5d3:0x4db3e01772076201< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hell there are like five elevators and you have to enter a code. This would be a good place to store stuff if you want to start an Internet business. One time I left my door unlocked and they called me. In fact, they freaked out and put ropes all around my storage door. They are kind of stupid sometimes but it is pretty nice space. You may want to buy a lantern to put in your space because they don't have a light in your actual storage area. In fact the whole place is fairly dark. However the spaces are clean, well maintained and decently priced........etc.</Text>< Pictures>

I kimberly rented a space from public storage and am very proud of the service that I receive here. Paul the property manager is amazing and very patient on helping me how to access my space put my lock on and show me how to lock it properly. It took me awhile but Paul waited for me and made sure it was locked and secured. He went above and beyond to help me with my needs and appreciate his help so much. I recommend anyone to rent at this public storage.</review>

Made to come in a week early for an 'INTERVIEW'.. a scam to shorten your term.  Started moving in on our date pre-booked online and found space was too small.  Public Storage staff said they could not change space, had to cancel online $1 for first month special and charged a LOADED rate.  DID NOT HONOR online rate.  LIARS AND CHEATS.  $5K MAX items in storage - OK if you are HOMELESS!

Staff LIE and CHEAT.  Predatory practices.  I WOULD NOT trust the staff at THIS FACILITY.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

I have been a tenant for 8 years and Paul Ramirez the property manager has shown what a real manger can do as far as helping tenants. He went out of his way to refund my auto pay so I can pay a prorated amount. I appreciate all he has done for me here, and enjoyed my stay here I recommend anyone to rent if Paul Ramirez is the Manager<//Review>

I had the pleasure of Cynthia helping me out this morning. Even though my original storage unit was taken she was able to locate me another and made my move transition a smooth one!</Text>

I been a customer here for about 2 years and just wanted to let the company know that Paul the property manager is amazing at his job and knows how to treat there customers and know the needs of people. If anyone needs a storage come see paul at the public storage on San Pedro street. Thanks Paul for all you do great customer service.<//review>

Romeo and Patty were great in assisting me on a day that was a disaster but it turned out to be the only highlight of the day once I walked in to do the paperwork. Thank you so much for your patience and knowledge about the units size (Romeo) and (Patty) for extending the time I needed to finish packing everything into the unit. Customer Service and professionalism A+!!</Text>

Thanks Paul for all your help.< /review>

So let me tell u why I rated this location 5 stars ...I was already coming in frustrated because I had gone to the location on grand and it was closed and it said it opened at 9:30 i was there at 10:30 am I have been trying to pay my monthly on line for a couple of days and was having problems so u can imagine I was already frustrated so since grand was closed I look up the nearest location which was this one ....let me tell u as soon as I walked in I was given some awesome customer service by Cynthia  and as someone who works in Customer service and deal with people all day . . It's a pleasure to come across someone with the same professionalism. ....thank you<//review>

Cynthia was such a sweetheart, it's rare to see someone smiling at work. She explained the pricing and units to me like the pro that she is. I was shocked to find out she's only been at this location for such a short time. This location is going to thrive with her here.</text>

< Review>
STOLEN TV & MACBOOK - 100% an Inside job!!!!!

Beware this property is stealing from its customers. In 10 days both my smart TV & hidden MacBook Air was stolen. Thankfully they were kind enough to leave me at least 1 TV (The smallest 1 out of the 2), how commendable.

March 9th, I arrived to reserve a unit, was recommended storage unit B-12 (1st floor) for the size I was seeking (10x20) by the employee handling my reservation. While inspecting the unit she pointed out issues with the wall and promised that maintenance would resolve that issue and the unit on the other side was vacant. She stressed that my unit would not need to be accessed at all and continued to clarify that my items would be safe and the property has cameras. Trusting her word and the name of public storage I went through with it, big mistake.

March 19th, upon opening my storage unit I immediately notice 1 of my TV’s are missing. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions so I investigated doing my best to leave as is. After be 90% confident by Tv is gone I visit the office to let them know the situation and was eventually met with the property manger who pretty much had nothing of value to say other than “That’s bizarre *head scratch*” he then told me I would have to file a police report and claim with insurance. Not till then I was informed there are NO cameras in this building and on the first floor. How convenient!

Upon moving my items out it became apparent my unit was accessed via the “vacant” neighboring unit, hence the wall structure, and steps on my mattress which were propped next to the “hole”. Then to make matters worse there is a hole the size of a closed fist that was covered with TAPE on the “vacant” unit side.

UNSAFE unprofessional  property overall. I will never use public storage again or recommend to anyone no matter the price. I would rather pay a high amount for 10days of secure storage then step foot on that property again.</Review>

Expect to see panhandlers and other shady looking characters outside this location.  It is gated but there's nothing appealing about it. It lacks proper maintenance of the grounds and a lot of foot traffic come in and out of here considering it is a storage and one would expect it to be very quite. Staff is rude. It sits along side the 110 fwy on a very busy street. Good luck!< /Text>

Honestly not sure how this place almost has 5 stars. The facility is literally garbage. Elevators don't work, extremely dirty buildings, and dust AND paint will get over everything you store there. The service staff (only one person) is usually not friendly. Avoid.<//Text>

<Review>I went to public storage near downtown on san pedro street where i was greeted by Paul the property manager he showed me a few spaces and was so professional and knowledgeable at what he does, although I didnt rent a space at his location due to the prices being kinda expensive during this time of the year. He did tell about other locations which met my target price and i will go there to rent. Im writing this review to show how valuable this individual is at public storage and knows what customer service is all about.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><name>Cynthia Ramirez< /name><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None</pics><Time>1462137912246<//Time></record>

This Guy Romeo forced his customers like a crying baby to write review in his favours. He almost didnt let me go home until he forced me to write a good review in his favour. Romeo stood on my head and tried to dictate me what to write and as soon as I finished he didnt even say thanks. Plus he tried to sell me stuff I didnt even need but Romeo persisted that I should buy boxes and packing supplies even though I really had nothing to pack. This guy is a rip off<//review>

I like the customer service. I would not change it. I like how the work inviroment and how the way they handle the customers and even if there is a conflict they are professional about it. They are really convinient and always notifie us about everyhting. Edith, patty, romeo are really great would not change this place and the price is great. The only thing is they need a little more carts.< /review>

System has been down for weeks which has the elevator and front gate system out of service. Really is that hard to get and keep this place cleaned up. This place has gone down more so, then what it already was.< /review>

The manager romeo he did such a great heart for the customer

I stingy recommend this place and romeo

Move your luggage, move and move things.
I was impressed by the manager Romeo and the warm heart and service.
We are grateful and highly recommended for our honesty and sincerity.

Some staff are not very friendly, organized or efficient. The doctor was friendly. I asked a staffer for help after being placed in a waiting room for a lengthy period and she walked away when I asked for help without saying anything to me. She asked another staff member to help me so she could clock out for her lunch break. There also isn't great communication between the doctor and the staff. The doctor told me to wait after my appointment and that someone would follow up with me to measure me for equipment. After 30 minutes and no one coming to see me I sought out help. When the staff were helping me with the equipment, they were not aware of how many pieces were needed and for what. Every time I asked a question they said they needed to ask the doctor. This made the appointment even longer. And they also forgot to give me two items and at that point I figured I would just pay for them myself because the staff did not seem to understand what was going on and we're taking so much longer than it should have.</review>

<text>Went in for a drug screen and hair test for my company. Waited for 6 other walking s to be taken before me, even though I was there first.
The girl doing the hair test had never shaved chest hair before, so she shaved the entire top half of my chest.
I have now been waiting 7 days for the results, the lab that tests them, says they have not even received my hair sample yet.
Simply incompetent people who work here.  Would not recommend using this facility.</text>< Rating>

Concentra in Sunnyvale is such a nice facility. Everyone I've dealt with throughout the years is so accommodating and kind. I've been seeing this Dr./ specialist for 14 years she is absolutely wonderful.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Concentra is one of the worst clinic, especially the one on E Arques Ave, Sunnyvale. The experience for covid testing has been horrible, unprofessional staff and receptionist. Doesn’t feel safe to go in this clinic especially during these unprecedented times. I do not know why companies tie up with such clinics. I have been to other clinics and they are far better in terms of staff behavior, hygiene and process than Concentra.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Please never visit this urgent care. It's horrible. I went in for a strep throat but doctor tried to convince me it was a dental issue and asked me to visit a dentist. I then stressed on checking my throat because she wouldn't do in the first place...then she checked and did find my tonsils inflamed. She prescribed me meds. I was still ok till this point and hadn't thought of leaving a negative review.
I drove 20 minutes from there to pharmacy near my home, waited in their queue only to be told that the doctor forgot to sign my prescription. I was so much in pain and had been fasting since 12 hours cause I couldn't swallow due to my throat pain. And in this painful condition I had to wait for couple hours more because of this act of huge huge irresponsibility.

If you want to save yourself time and irritation, please don't go to this place.< /review>< Pics>

So Thursday when I did the drug test they told me it takes about 24hrs and if I needed a copy they would send it to my address or email and I added my email, but since then I haven't heard from them and I still have not received my test results. So I called today to follow-up and after waiting on hold for 15 minutes I hung up and called back again and waited another 5 minutes to speak to a representative  named Jennifer. She told me they don't send results to your email at all and that they didn't even have them on file and I would need to contact my employer to find out. This place is a joke and has the worst service ever. They took my info and email and I still haven't received anything and to get an answer like this while waiting to go to work is just unacceptable.</Review>

I had a pleasant experience at the Sunnyvale facility. It was very clean and presentable and the staff made me feel comfortable and took the time to explain each procedure, and they did so with a smile 😊
However, I have 1 recommendation and that is to have a more visible sign near the street/driveway to access the business.</Review>

<Text>I had a really unfortunate experience after trying to go to three urgent cares. The team here seemed mostly unprofessional and in times like these were not requiring guests to wear masks properly or holding each other accountable to it either. The young man at the front desk rarely had his mask on correctly nor did the doctor when he came into the room (he also had crumbs all down his shirt). The staff is not sanitizing or cleaning the waiting room as people are in or out which caused me to stand the entire time that I was waiting. One of the workers tried to turn me away an hour after waiting in the lobby because my symptoms were considered life threatening -  I had a conversation with the doctor later after asking for clarification on why they weren't going to see me and he got defensive telling me that it's their top priority to get me the correct assistance promptly... (Which again -- in this case was an hour before receiving that information when it was the first thing I wrote down and handed in with my paperwork). He then started asking clarifying questions to diagnose me ( asked how intense my chest pain in) poked me a few times and told me I had inflammation on the cartilage. He started rambling about how he was sure this was my diagnoses but was trying to entertain and confirm that they didn't have the equipment to run the proper procedures as he had originally tried to tell me. At this point I was uninterested in whatever point he was trying to prove as I am not playing games when it comes to my health. I let him know that I was extremely uncomfortable and that I would be leaving. I understand that I am not a doctor or licenced medical professional but I've spent enough time in hospitals and with doctors due to my health conditions as a child and this experience was one of the worst I have ever had. I understand these are stressful times and that our front line workers have really been going through it - however - that doesn't justify lowering professionalism and safety. It seems like the management of this location needs to take a closer look at what's happening here because most of these reviews are very negative. To summarize - I received better care and saw better safety practices while going through a fast food drive through on my way home following this experience.< /Text>< time>

<text>This place had WAY too many people inside. It’s impossible to socially distance. The chairs are even close together (about 2 feet apart). This place is a breeding ground for Covid. Absolutely ridiculous. I just walked out and told my employer to send me somewhere else.<//text>< Rate>

<Review>Please don’t come to this clinic, it’s the worst! There is no social distancing in there, people walk in without facemasks, the doctors are horrible and you will be waiting for over 40min.

Aye Aung, M.D. has been trying to get me to say I got hurt differently than how I did, she also makes comments about how it’s probably something else and I should see a general doctor (I did, blood/pee work came back negative for everything!!!). I’ve been going to this clinic for weeks now and pain has not gone away, but Aye Aung, M.D. said “Your young, you’ll be fine and you’ll get better by yourself okay? Go see another doctor, you probably got hurt as a child and not at your work because look you don’t seem to have pain”. A doctor should not assume a patient isn’t in pain, they shouldn’t even try to convince their patients to say something that’s not true. Also, while I was there they were looking for a womens lost lab work paper. Please don’t go to this clinic.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<rate>2</rate><review>Physical Therapy is amazing, staff is determined and passionate about providing the best care possible. The Specialist /Surgery Doctor is very insensitive to patients needs. Answers questions assuming you already know the answers. Walked out feeling like I have no medical support. Providers need to understand that life is hard enough with out working and dealing with workmen comp aside from the fact that your injury has permanently changed your life. I hate feeling like I'm just another patient that broke her hip... I feel hopeless...< /review>< Pictures>

The doctors I’ve seen have been very good. My issue is with the wait times. Had a 10:30 appointment. Did not get seen until 11:45 and was not checked out until 12:45. What is the point of making an appointment? Spending over two hours on a simple follow up appointment is unacceptable.< /review>

Not the greatest experience. I got some (first degree) burns early in the morning (around 5 am) and found this was the first urgent care open near me. I was literally waiting at their door for 15 minutes before they opened at 7 and was the first one in. It was completely enpty, yet it still took over a half hour before I was seen by anyone. The nurse took a look and didn't fill out the right paperwork, so when the doctor came in to take a look she left and had to come back again. All in all I was probably waiting 60+ minutes as the very first person in the door for the day which feels ridiculous.

Medical care itself seemed to be fine.</Review>

Had to wait 2 hrs with an appointment plus 2 days later had a sinus issue turns out it was the Flu...lot of sick people cough & not wearing masks.  I  been to better facilities than the one I  went to..even the  computer intake information system was faulty.   If I  have to do another pre-employment exam will request another source.< /review>

<Text>I walked in to the clinic today at 1:03pm. I was told at that time it would be a 30 minute wait. After 30 minutes passes, I ask again and I’m told that it will only be 20 more minutes.

It has currently been 2 hours and no one has seen me.

I understand having to wait. That’s not my problem. My problem is that I was not given accurate wait times so that I could have decided how to best make arrangements for my day. If I would have been told the truth up front; I would have made other arrangements for this appointment.

Very disappointed.</Text><pics>None<//pics><user_name>Sj B< /user_name>< gmapID>

<text>Took a drug test here and my employer never received the results. My employer contacted the lab and they said there's no record found for donor. I knew I was going to have issues with this place when the medical assistant who took my urine samples was having issues filling out my paperwork and their digital platform FormFox crashed so he had to manually hand write all my info and switch my urine from the bottles they were already in, over to new bottles. All I know is someone dropped the ball here and I just want my results! I was supposed to start work on 11/11 but they had to push my start date back a week. I'm super disappointed and dissatisfied. This is a huge inconvenience when people have bills to pay.</text><date>1573534379435</date><Rating>1</Rating>< Gmap_id>

<text>Any place that has coffee ready for you when you walk in is top notch in my book😁. I felt so bad for the receptionist. The credit card reader was not working and she felt so bad telling me that they needed cash. NP atm right across the street.
The doctor was outstanding and very versed in DOT medical certification.
Thank you so much for the great service.

I waited for 1.5 hr coming with horrible flu like symptoms and a high fever.

They dont seem to be concerned about the. patients. They at least could have run the flu test while i was waiting - but nope!

Just do not go and choose another provider, as it will be a waste of your time and health.< /text>

Very very slow service, the woman that did my test was nice and professional but it took almost 1 hour waiting in the lobby, then a weird, rude and non-sense Indian doctor came into the room and had a bad bad atitude to do the tests and then closed the door behind him and people forgot about me, at 5:00pm I opened the door and asked how long I would still wait and the lady in the computer just said: I didn’t know you were there ... and then I heard she saying to the other woman: well tell him to be back other day ...
it was a bad experience and I hope I don’t need to get back there again.<//text>

Compared to the very first 4 hour visit, I got to go in much sooner and was seen by the staff almost immediately. Everyone was so patient and even treated me a lot nicer. I didn’t feel rushed either so overall a good visit and I’m glad to be getting treated here for my injuries.< /Review>

On July 18th, 2019 I went to Concentra Urgent Care in Sunnyvale for a pre employment drug screening exam at about 10:45 am. The office was moderately filled with clients. I didn't have an appointment so I waited for approximately one hour before I was waited helped. The lab tech that assisted me was very coy and unwelcoming. He told me to place my personal belongings into a locker and lock them during the screening. After completing my drug screening, I finished up signing some documents. He told me very quickly and with an abrasive attitude where to sign, date, and put my contact information. Having only gotten a minimum amount of sleep the night before after working 14 hrs shifts for the last week, my attention span may have been a little slow. When signing the paper, I accidentally signed in the wrong place and at this point he just lost his composure and snapped at me. He began to ridicule me and admonish me as if I was a 6 year old kid goofing off in church. I looked at him and couldn't believe he said and did that in front of other coworkers and clients. I told him you know, people make mistakes all of the time and he could have stopped me before finishing signing the paperwork and creating this problem in the first place. He just shook his head and laughed it off. I took my belongings I had locked up and stormed out of there demanding to talk to the supervisor or manager. I spoke with Jeff Godell who was the daytime manager and explained my grievance with him. He told me that he apologized for the wait due to their understaffing. I told them that wasn't an excuse to be treated the way l was by one of his employees who lacked customer service to say the least and made me feel like an idiot on top of that. I got his information and told him I would be making a formal complaint.  This will be the last time I ever patronize this facility. Recommended 1/10< /review>

Ridiculous. I've now had to come here twice for work related injury. And when I made an appointment for a checkup I was waiting and hour and a half before I was even seen.

< Review>
I had to come here to get a hepititis B vaccine. The first injection I received was $94 out the door. My arm hurt the whole first month and I still don't have full range of motion because of the side effects of the shot. I went back for my second dose a month later. I had the manager inform me that I'd have to pay $135 for the dose this time. My first charge of $94 was a mistake on their end. Then as I went to pay for the dose, the front desk lady stated I'd also have to pay $113 office visit fee on top of the dose fee! No. That's just way too much money to wait 30-60 minutes in the waiting room and then to sit in another room for an injection. I don't even mind getting shots but I don't feel it's worth it to get anymore long term painful injections especially when they're charging me different fees everytime. If it was a mistake the first time on their part, I didn't appreciate the lack of communicationthe second time. I need my arm for work. After these injections, it's extremely uncomfortable to use my arm to do my job. I'm not happy that I can't get affordable, long-term/pain free, much needed vaccinations in order to work in my community, all the while without being properly communicated with.< /Review>

<Text>Excellent urgent care i would recommend everyone nearby. especially i would like to thanks fot the staff and exclusive special thanks to doctor isha abdullah at this branch she was kind and patient friendly i got my health back she treated me in a proper way

The best gender neutral clinic and best gender neutral doctor  (Dr.Isha Abdullah M.D)a high qualified doctor we rarely see in urgent care centers.

The day when i had emergency she Dr.Isha Abdullah was the only doctor who accepted my case after the remaining doctors in other places could not take up due to various reasons i still remember my mental situation that day was heavy rain and worst weather in bayarea and other clinics were not ready to treat me as i am Male  and the other clinics were busy and not good gender neutral doctors they are only dealing with peadriatic and pregnency realted female care .

My experience with this clinic is  a life changing experience and the advice i was given regarding health bought me lot of awareness regarding personal health care and the staff is friendly .

cons: advice to the  Higher administration of U.S. Health Works -the process of first time registration and accepting the new patients should be fast  and a sick patient cannot fill up all the details in the paper application himself this should be changed and please do speed up the service time regarding office work</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Text>Terrible patient care. Complete lack of continuity of care and no communication between providers and administration. Twice I have left a message for the doctors or practitioners, only to either not get a call back or have the call returned 5 minutes before they close. Unable to get pain management for several days because of their internal ineptitude for an acute injury requiring 12+ weeks of care.

Unfortunately because its workmans comp, you can get pigeonholed into being forced to go to them. Avoid this place if you can.< /Text>< Response>

<text>Terrible customer service by the receptionists. Some of the ladies at the front desk are unprofessional in their behavior (checking cell phones, gossiping about clients) and are just flat out rude. Wait time was to be expected, but the receptionists were nowhere near accurate in estimating wait times. I was told 40 minutes over the phone. I got to the clinic within 15 minutes and the waiting room only had 4 people other than myself. I waited over an hour and a half before I was seen, just for a literal 5-minute procedure.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1502398915281, 'text': 'Hello Angela,\n\nThank you for taking the time to provide us with a review.

<user_name>クリスティーナ< /user_name><Text>I’m writing this review from a horrible experience from a month ago. I would give this place zero stars if I could. Worst experience I've ever had. I drove thirty-two miles for a physical therapy appointment that was apparently cancelled but I never once received a phone call from my cell phone. Someone from US Healthworks called saying nothing then hung up in the voicemail from my house phone. I talked to the manager and she declared they did contact me. 95% of the time, these idiots always get my area code wrong which is what probably happened to the staff who need to learn how to read carefully! Here's the funny response the manager, Ms. Yvette said, “The person responsible for it has worked here for 14 years and I’ve never had a complaint like this before” This response is very hard to believe because of all the negative reviews I'm reading. Judging by these negative reviews, it seems like the employees had messed up many times and are very rude. Not only did I waste gas, but I felt like the staff were playing games with me. That’s not all. These unqualified 'doctors' here will criticize and think you’re lying. I would not recommend anyone coming to this urgent care. It’s obvious this company receives so many complaints that they're at the point that they don't care. They have no consideration and no compassion for their patients at all. We made a complaint and the funny part is, in the beginning of the new week, now I start getting phone calls from my cell phone for once!  The receptionist did not say her name but her tone was unprofessional and I could tell she was annoyed. "Hey! We called you yesterday! We're trying to schedule you another appointment!" These are the kind of people they hire? Very shameful. If you don't like dealing with patients, then why did you choose this job?

Final update 4/20/18. Thanks to my attorney, I got the treatment I needed but not from this place though. The company doctors here do not care about you. Jackson claimed I had scoliosis from just looking at me and was declaring I always had it from months ago. He even said there was nothing wrong with my arm which turned out to be not true. Do not listen to Jackson because when I first saw him, I just knew he was one of those uncaring doctors that will belittle anyone. I was still in pain and he was telling me to go see another doctor. That's when I got an attorney and turns out, US Healthworks has a bad reputation of treating their patients like trash obviously. Will never be coming back to this place again. Should be called US Hellworks. The nice doctor I saw said I did not have scoliosis. Well, that already tells me how the doctors are in US Hellworks.< /Text></record>

I would not recommend this urgent care--would give 0 stars if I could.   Long waits, Asian NP was condescending and misdiagnosed my son, and no return phone calls when told to call back if condition worsened. Also, there were no flu tests available--what urgent care does not stock a flu test in the middle of the flu season?< /text>

There is nothing "urgent" about this urgent care. It took an hour an a half for a simple diagnosis and they won't call prescriptions in to the pharmacy.</text>

This place deserves a 0-zero!!! The front staff is not welcoming or hospital and then the male manager is not personable. When presented with a problem and given a possible solution-he was unable to budge and accept it and make it work. Horrible. Never again< /text>

0 stars. Waited for 45 minutes before being told my paperwork had been lost. Then waited another 45 minutes and watched 4 people, who came in after me, get seen before me. I then left.</Text>

This is the absolute worst place to come for any medical needs or issues I was told I can come in early (an hour and 45 mins) and they can get me not only did they not get me in early it's been a half hour past my scheduled appointment time and they still have not gotten to me and act like there's nothing wrong when I asked why they're skipping past me every time they call someone else</text>

Awesome customer service. I bought a pair of ice skates there and they did the full fitting and scan. The associate was very patient and let me try on a lot of skates to find the right one for me. Did the full True baking and fitting and I'm super happy with the experience. They even baked and fitted my True inline skates, which they do not carry. Highly recommend. Their staff knows their stuff!< /Text>

Great selection and prices, even let me and my bud use their slapshot area for a bit. Gave us a much better outlook on where to put our money. Great customer service. I drove from vegas out to pure hockey and ended up here, now i will be driving from vegas to here directly.<//review>

Mask required at all times.
Total number of customers in store is limited.

They carry equipment for hockey (skaters and goalie), baseball, and lacrosse.  They also carry sports apparel.   They also offer skate sharpening and skate repair.
If they don't have an item in stock they will order it and have it shipped to you at no additional cost.
The customer service is better than most.  I had some items missing on gear that was shipped to me.   One 5 minute phone call and the missing pieces were shipped out that day.<//Text></record>

Awesome store with lots of Baseball/Softball, Hockey, and Lacrosse equipment. They have an indoor cage for trying out bats and lacrosse sticks. Also a little mini hockey cage for trying hockey sticks as well. This is a well known store with lots of pictures to help describe in more detail.</Text>

Brody was amazing. Thank you for your help and support with my son's lacrosse stick and head. He was super supportive and actually took control of the stick and was able to make it more responsive and efficient. I highly recommend this store to anyone who has a dedication to this sport. Thank you Brody.</review>

I generally have success when I make the trip to Monkey sports. This trip - they are out of the sizes I need in multiple baseball items. At the start of baseball season...was it a surprise?</Review>

I just began playing hockey and bought my skates and most of my gear from monkeysports. The prices are competitive to the market and seem fair. The sales staff is very friendly and enthusiastic about getting you all set. But if you don’t get their attention right away you may find yourself waiting 30+ minutes for help. I’ve have a couple recent negative experiences explaining the 2-star review. First, they said they’d put on a clear face mask to my helmet, which they did but put it on upside down. Fortunately someone at the rink had the tools I needed to redo it properly. Second, the sales staff said my skates were good to go upon leaving the store. After my first game I found out they never sharpened the skates.  I’m new to the sport and I’m inexperienced, so I trusted what they said and that they knew what they were doing. After learning the hard way (I’ve got the bruises to prove it), I’ve been able to see what they failed to tell me and what I need to keep an eye on for my equipment from here on out. It’s still the closest hockey retailer to me currently but I would just do my research on every last thing you need before you get on the ice rather than just go by what they’re saying.</Review>

If you play hockey or lacrosse this is your go to store for gear. Great deals and helpful staff. Skate sharpening and sizing as well as many different styles and brands of gear. If they dont have what you need they can order it.</text>

I read many reviews complaining about poor service and unfriendly employees. So I was a bit apprehensive going into the store. Well I’m happy to say that Lupe and Trenton were fabulous with my difficult request. They were more than obliging and friendly. Thanks for the great service.</Text>

Only one guy was helping people. All 5 other guys stood  up front talking and not making any effort to help. One was actually someone in charge,  as the guy who was helping us kept asking him questions. I even said in front of all of them "Dude it looks like they want you to do it all tonight." They all laughed and thought it was funny. The woman that came in were on there own finding stuff. We noticed every guy that came in, got a greeting from one of the "stand around guys"   They pretty much ignored the woman. You DON'T get the feeling of Welcome..

Walked in wanting to splash out on new blades, ended up walking out. 3 people up front, all stopped their conversation to stare at me as I walked in, no greeting, then just turned back to continue their convo. Spent a good few minutes looking at their blades, even found the ones I was looking at online, but alas, nobody asked if they could help me and I didn’t see anyone around, so I ended up not trying or buying. Manager, have a word with your team about customer service...it’s a nicely stocked, beautiful store in a great location, but it looks like I’m not alone in my opinion and that will most certainly affect business.< /Review>

This is a wonderful place to pick up most any sports equipment and supplies. They have all kinds of baseball equipment which is nice because we can usually get our shopping done here without having to go anywhere else. The staff and customer service are superb and always willing to go the extra mile.</Text>

<review>Excellent customer service.  We don't know what to buy ice hockey gears for our kid.  They have an employee go with us to help my boy pick out the gear.  It's took more than an hour for him go back and forth to get everything that fit for my boy, kudo for that employee.  Would do business with them again.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcdea4043ab69d:0x7d482836f80aac6b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place for your baseball needs. There are deals to be found in store and online. The one knock would be is that they don't really cater to the entry level player.<//review>

Since my son began baseball several years ago, I've purchased his equipment from this store. Staff is very helpful.  But recently purchased a baseball bat that has a defect and was told that I had to deal with the manufacturer directly.  I called DICK's Sporting Goods to inquire as to their policy and was told that if purchased in the first 60 days they will handle the warranty matter for you.  Wish MonkeySports would do the same.<//Review>

This is going to sound contrived but so be it... Dave Reskey, the manager and captain of the SS MonkeySports Irvine and his crew are great. It's gotta be a tough business to have many customers only shopping the fit and going eventually buying the item online. His team weathers it all and follow through with great customer service and product and sport IQ. The store is well stocked and laid out well.< /review>

Best local lacrosse retailer in the area. If they do not have what you want on the shelf, they can order just about anything from their Texas warehouse and have it delivered direct to your home for the same internet prices. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful.</text>

Walk in to the ice hockey side and don't be surprised that 9 times out of 10 whoever you ask questions hasn't ever played hockey and will tell you "well, I've heard other people say...".  I've experienced this a few times, but the latest incident compelled me to finally write about it.

Recently joined a beginner roller hockey league. I had no idea what I needed and was wandering around the storm aimlessly until I was helped out by one of the customer service reps, Johnathan. He was super patient with me and showed me multiple options to fit my needs. He explained all the nuances with the different equipment and didn't try to unnecessarily up-sell me on stuff I didn't need yet as a beginner. I was able to leave the store fully equipped for the league and even got to try the gear out that night since the nearby rink had open stick time. Everything worked great! Madd props to John for helping me!< /Review>

This location offers plentiful options for hockey gear, baseball, lacrosse, and other sports. However, every time I go in the employees seem arrogant about their knowledge. I ask a question and they look at me like I am stupid. I was in there looking for a new hockey stick and I asked an employee to help me pick one. He asked me what flex I was looking for and when I told him I wasn't sure he just looked at me like I had never played hockey before. Instead he could have told me the differences between the flexes but all he did was go "uhmm.... Okay well this is a good flex here" and offered me a $200 hockey stick. Obviously, if I don't know what a flex is, I doubt I will be needing a professional grade hockey stick.</review>

I went to Monkey Sports to buy new ice skates. The salesman who helped me was very friendly and accommodating. I tried on several pairs of skates before settling on the Vapor X7.0. I asked the salesman if Monkey Sports offered free skate sharpening for the life of the skates if I bought the skates there (Hockey Giant offers this service).  He said yes, so I got the skates baked, I paid and left.

I came back about a week later to get the skates sharpened and was asked to pay $6 at the counter. I questioned the cashier's reason for charging me and explained that the salesman promised me free skate sharpening. She said, "No, we only sharpen them once when you first buy the skates."

The employee who sold me the skates happened to be working that day. I explained to him that I was being charged for skate sharpening. He offered to go speak with the manager about my situation. He returned a few minutes later only to confirm what the cashier had told me: basically, "sorry dude.  Buyer beware." I left the store quite frustrated.

About a month after my purchase, I wrote a polite letter to Monkey Sports management explaining what happened.  After a few weeks of no response, I sent an email to the address on their website.  They never replied to the letter or the email.

I have since replaced the Vapors with Supreme NXGs purchased at Hockey Giant.  The skates even came with a little HG sticker on the bottom of the boot that gives me free skate sharpening at Giant for the life of the skates.

Monkey Sports, you have made me a Hockey Giant customer for life.</review>

< Review>
My son went to this store a couple days ago and tried to buy a pair of hockey skates. They did not have his size so they sold him a pair 1/2 size bigger and he thought they would be okay, but when he skated on them a couple days later his foot was moving around so he tried to return them today and the salesperson said the Store Manager would have to approve he exchange. The store manager was very rude and through the box of skates at my son and told him he could not exchange them because he had worn them. The manager also told him he should sell them on Ebay. This was a $600 plus purchase and I have never heard of a Store Manager being so rude and uncaring. This happened around 3:30 today so if anyone else has had this type of experience I would encourage you to post it. I will never buy anything from this store again and I warn everyone else not to either.</Review>

It's a new store, and very close to the related Goalie Monkey.  However, I was hoping for something that didn't feel like every large sporting goods store.  The only difference between this store and most any other large sporting goods store was that they didn't carry running or weightlifting equipment.  I was hoping I would find something that catered to the local sporting community (local school equipment, for instance, or referee equipment) more.</Review>

<text>Well, I used to come to this store to buy my son‘s baseball gear; however, one day I was about to pay the items, a customer in front of me automaticly got a discount coupon scaned for his purchase but I did not get the discount, I felt why I spent more than other people for the same items, so now if  I have other choice, I will not go there to spend money, they are not honored.
If I can find something in different store, I will never gone to Monkey sports to buy, again, terrible place, bad staff!</text><Name>Seany Feng< /Name><response>None< /response><rate>1<//rate><gmapID>0x80dcdea4043ab69d:0x7d482836f80aac6b< /gmapID>< Pics>

< review>
I bought my son several things for Baseball (metal cleats, gloves, a new helmet, a BowNet etc) with the help of a MonkeySport employee. Not being familiar with what the best tee is I asked for guidance on what to purchase. Ultimately I ended up buying a SKLZ V-Tee for $80.00. My son opened it on Christmas Day (3 days after I bought it from a MonkeySports) and after one day of use the Tee snapped (it’s made of thick rubber). I called MonkeySports to ask for a return as these are supposed to be extra durable (my son is only
12). I was told they don’t take returns and I have to take it up with the manufacturer. I called the company and was told they would issue a refund in the form of a MasterCard and it would take 8-10 weeks. What a disaster- my son isn’t able to use his Xmas gift and I have to spend more money to replace it while I wait 2-3 months for the refund. Sadly I won’t be buying anything from MonkeySports again! Poor customer service!</review>

<time>1521811685473< /time><text>Disappointing interaction with this store.  I bought a new USA Baseball Standard  ~$100 bat at full price for my son's upcoming season.  Within a week, the aluminum cracked just above the handle during soft toss batting practice with his team- clearly a defect.  I called the manufacturer and they did say that their policy was to handle warranty issues directly through them and not the store.  But, in light of the equipment failure such a short time after purchase, they encouraged me to go back to the store to try to get a direct exchange so my son would not be without a bat for ~2 weeks mid season.  The store manager showed no interest or flexibility in considering our request.  They are willing to sell you the bat at full price but do not stand by the product.  We had better service with an Easton bat quality concern through the now out of business Sports Authority.  So be aware that you may be out the cost of the bat and have no functioning piece of equipment while dealing with the manufacturer and shipping items back and forth through the mail.<//text>< Rate>

Horrible customer service. Trying to buy cleats, there's no sales guy to be found.  Waiting for 30  minutes asked for a sales guy and still no sales person. Dick's sporting goods hands down best customer service!!!!</text>

<Review>It's nice that Cal Poly students have access to a mini-market and can use meal credit at it. That's a luxury that many University students don't have. But for non-meal credit holding students, the market is kind of mediocre. Item selection is pretty good for a convenience store, but the prices between items vary drastically. For instance, a small bag of "premium" trail mix costs $7.50 while a large bag of generic trail mix costs $2.99 🤷‍♂️. As long as you know what your getting, Campus Market is OK for an occasional snack but isn't super reliable. Also, the market is frequently overcrowded during the school year, causing long checkout lines, which kind of diminishes the convenience factor or the market.</Review><time>1566690651987</time></record>

<Text>A good place on campus to get necessities and various food items. Definite markup compared to off-campus retailers, but not overly unreasonable.

The grill is a good place to get the quick bite, and the sushi is not bad either. There is also a salad bar, a pair of hot entrees, and soup of the day available. Kudos to the staff and student employees! :)<//Text>< userid>

BEST POTATOES ON THE PLANET. You definitely want to make your way to Campus Market between 11-3 on Monday and/or Tuesday to get a PREMIUM Campus Market Loaded Baked Potato (TM) for the price of one (1) meal credit. Options include a hot wing potato, which is definitely my personal favorite, BBQ, ranch-hand, and some other vegetarian option.

This is the absolute best usage of your time and money, so find a first year to plus daddy you if you don't have a meal plan. The only downside to this wonderful treat, is the fact that they are only served twice a week. This means the other 5 days, you're left wanting more. They have somewhat fixed this problem by serving rice bowls for lunch at the same time on Thursday and Friday, but this seems like an afterthought compared to the perfection that is the Campus Market Loaded Baked Potato (TM).

------

Outside of the Campus Market Loaded Baked Potato (TM), prices are ridiculously high and there isn't much room to actually eat your food if the weather is bad [something about always being sunny in SLO]. Normally, this would tank my rating, but the Campus Market Loaded Baked Potato (TM) is an absolute treat that keeps this rating at an unwavering 5 stars.</Review>

< Review>
I go to "Campus Markup" a lot solely because it is convenient and I'm on campus 10 hours a day. Almost everything is massively, frustratingly overpriced - it's a game for me at this point to find the most remote places in this country that are still cheaper than campus market. What's weird is that the price markups are inconsistent - you'll have candy that's the same price as off-campus next to peanut butter that's 3x its normal price.

The cooked food is pretty mediocre, and once again overpriced. I'd recommend the Starbucks breakfast sandwiches on the other side of the store over anything I've tried. The Starbucks, at least, is basically a normal Starbucks.

If you can go off campus, don't go here.</Review>

UCSD, UCLA hell, even Pomona has a larger selection of dinning options than Cal Poly. I won't buy here for a while, then decide to try it again only to be constantly disappointed.

< Review>
The prices are very high and are not listed for many items, making it very difficult to be a thrifty shopper. Also, the selection is rather small, and it is very difficult to find healthy food. For example, after searching through over twenty kinds of trail mix and mixed nuts, I found a single bag that was not salted or sweetened. If you have extra plus dollars, there are some items to grab here other than food, such as plastic cups, but if you are paying with your own money, there are much better options elsewhere.< /Review>

The Grill used to have decent food at an expensive price because it was at least made fresh to order, but now all you get is a dish that was half-assed and left under a heat lamp for 3 hours until you walked in the door. Seriously, the breakfast burrito went from halfway decent this past spring, to 90% uncooked tortilla and eggs week 1 of Fall 2017. Anything off of the Grill menu is worse now because it's basically cold and flavorless by the time you sit down to eat it AND with all of the renovations Poly has done, this farce of a meal is even more expensive than it was before. Salad bar is questionable on the best of days and the grocery items are (to put it lightly) marked up for convenience.
Students who work there are the saving grace because they at least have kind customer service manners and do their best given the work environment. I know that no one in administration takes these reviews seriously, but hopefully this will prevent someone else from getting scammed.
Cal Poly Corp, do better, because this is pathetic.</Text>

< Review>
Selection pricing is really intended for students on meal plans, so for anyone paying regular cash, it's a little pricey. But it offers some things you can't get on campus (or even that nearby off-campus, since the nearest grocery store closed).<//Review>

Arizona Iced teas and Cherry Coke on occasion. My friend Jen, owns this incredible dog grooming salon/store in the same business park, goes here and is very friendly with the owner. Very easy going vibe. Quick in, quick out..Very fast service also. Prices are what you'd expect, but not teetering on 'high'. Parking could be better, ample enough, yet a tight runway near the front entrance will like be experienced at times, so be watchful and enjoy your time in the store.<//text>

One of my favorite liquor stores. Not just because it's convenient and they've always been nice to me, but because of that walk-in freezer with the killer craft beer selection. I mean, yeah, there're specialty shops with even better selection, but this thing is like right around the corner and when they first added the freezer it caught me off guard. The place is so unassuming. Great hard liquor selection selection, as well.< /Text>

This place is tucked away but it's convenient for me when I'm in that area. They have a good selection of beers with a walk in beer Locker and there's all kinds of beer and their and I think they have wine too. The gentleman at the counter he's always in a good mood and they have a few cheap shots if that happens to be what you're in the mood for. It's tucked away on the inside corner Springdale and it could be missed if you're not looking for it while you're driving past.<//review>

Well, service was good. pretty quick considering the place was packed. My only thing is the people working there. They really don't small talk or smile. they felt like zombies just working.Which is a good thing,but they felt not too friendly. I was waiting for car and felt award. If your a people person that talks and want to feel welcome...well this shop won't do that. they did do a good job and sorta quick... price was good. not cheap or too expensive.</text>

<Text>Hit some wood on the freeway which caused my low pressure light to come on. Went to the tire spot and they had me in and out in 30 minutes for $20 for a patched up tire. Not only that but they fixed the under cover which had gotten damaged and came loose for free. Highly recommend!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2ca47c6f56da9:0x864666174e4febc9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been here a few times and I find them pretty trust worthy on their jobs. They inspected my car suspension before before performing the alignment, no one else had done that before on previous shop. Also they have pretty good prices.< /review>

I have 5 sons and with 5 cars and they have been coming here for years and years. When I need service Alex, Miguel and the entire shop treat me with excellent care and best discount prices. If you want trustworthy service and excellent work on your cars Avalon tire is the #1 place... thanks guys...Nina:)< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>They are very professional outside looking in but when they replaced my control arms and did a wheel alignment on my car, i noticed my remote to my radio was missing along with a movie that was in the radio. I gave them a second chance and went back (because the owner is very nice) I bought a tire and I left. I got home and noticed a bubble was in my tire and I paid fulled price.

I've been coming here for several years for tires and oil changes for both business and personal vehicles.  Now that I no longer have a business in the area, I still make the drive to have these friendly and professional folks look after my vehicles.<//Review>

<Time>1562701153450<//Time><rate>2< /rate><Text>(Translated by Google) I think the final price is not real or the person who attended me wanted to see my face and charge more ...

The alignment service costs $ 60.00, the tires were rotated, the tires were calibrated, the rudder was aligned, a basic inspection was done, etc. At the end, one of the mechanics calls me and he tells me that it is necessary to finish the alignment with a cam screw, to give a little inclination to the rim and that it was within the acceptable range.

It is heard considerable, what I did not expect that screw would cost $ 40.00, I thought it unfair that the price is almost the equivalent of full service taking into account that a single screw does not exceed $ 15.00 whatever the brand may be, although I found the pair of screws like for $ 10.00 on Amazon. And let's think that they buy the screws wholesale.

And taking the word from him, that the change of screws takes no more than 5 minutes.

Anyway, I left with a half service and a car not 100% aligned.

Creo el precio final o no es real o la persona que me atendió me quiso ver la cara y cobrar de más...

El servicio de alineación cuesta $60.00, me rotaron las llantas, me calibraron la llantas, me alinearon el timón, hicieron una inspección básica, etc. Al final me llama uno de los mecánicos y me comunica que es necesario para terminar la alineación colocarle un tornillo de leva, para darle un poco de inclinación a la llanta y que estuviera dentro del margen aceptable.

Se escucha considerable, lo que no esperaba que ese tornillo tendría un costo de $40.00, me pareció injusto que el precio sea casi el equivalente al servicio completo tomando en cuenta que un solo tornillo no excede los $15.00 sea de la marca que sea, aunque encontré el par de tornillos como por $10.00 en Amazon. Y pensemos que ellos compran los tornillos por mayoreo.

Y tomando la palabra de el, que el cambio de tornillos tarda no más de 5 minutos.

En fin, me fui con un servicio a medias y un carro no alineado al 100%.< /Text>< Pictures>

As soon as I stepped into the store a young man with light hair and a beard asked if he could help me find something. Thats what I like! He walked me to the aisle and told me there were options and mentioned there were other similar suggestions in another part of the store. Thats the kind of engaging service I look for in this kind of store. I ended up buying a couple extra things that weren't on my list, including a drink. What a great place to buy a gift! Thank you for excellent customer service! 😁<//Text>

< Review>
I drove 45 minutes out of my way to come to purchase a specific pair of Cortez  they did not have in stock. I called ahead of time so obviously you can understand my frustration to come to realize they dont carry the shoe.  Their website is inaccurate. It shoes shoes in stock. They staff can do a better job at communicating and serving customers. I won’t be back.</Review>

Updated review
Today I had to go back to the store because i need it to return a new purchase I made on finish line (I'm a frequent shopper at finish line ).
I walk in the store, got to the register and the cashier was ( Linda )and the first thing that she told me was; "didn't i help you before ? and I said yes about 1 week or two ago then she said "oh yeah you are the guy that put a bad review on me ",The guy i didn't want to take the shoes back ! in a very rude way !!! and I heard some of the store associates  laugh and some very surprise that  she said that ! I was beyond surprise!! than i said to her you don't tell people off like that, everyone is entitle  to their opinion, and i told her  i need to talk to your manager this is not cool !!! then she replied "Im the manager!",I did not know what to do, then I told her,I was going to update my review !! I ask for the store manager name and she didnt want to write down until i insist for her to write it down.
I felt really mad,this is not the way to treat your frequent customers (specially management !)This is not right !
I call corporate office and made a complaint !< /text>

Literally walked into the store looking to buy shoes and because of the lack of customer service and the incompetence of the guy who was supposed to help me but forgot my shoe size but yet said no size was available ? you must be thinking it must of been crowded for this kind of stupidity to happen right? But no it was not at all, so I’d rather spend my money where I feel comfortable going to a an employee and not having to break up a group of young incompetent kids who don’t understand what customer service is< /text>

I ask for some shoes that were on sale the guy came and said i don’t have in that color but i have black, so I tried those when i went to pay they were more expensive because they were not the same shoe, and the total was way out of my budget.<//Review>

He then told me that he will get it for me. Despite being paciente with this dude, after everyone had left the store the other works didn’t seem to care about any assistance. He then tells me they were closed and I was only able to look for one shoe. Very unprofessional. I still got my shoe but will take this complaint to corporate. Don’t take me wrong, I get that yall closing but there were like 8 other workers who could of used that time to help me and get me out of there ASAP.</review>< user_name>

<review>I didn't find the shoes I was looking for, but their employees are great! One of the managers in training was helping us, and she was very kind and tried to find what I was looking for. I can't ask for more then the effort, and she had it!!!</review>< gmap_id>

I was ignored, given attitude, spent more than an hour and a half in there, shorted my change when I return to the store no one was to be found, all  associates were in the back. Overall very bad experience I will no longer be shopping at this store or mall.</Text>

I went by myself and I walked to the Northridge Mall and I walked inside the Northridge Mall then walked to Finish Line. I went inside Finish Line to browse around and look at basketball, running, baseball shoes, and sandals. The cashier did good customer service and there was no Men's bathroom< /text>

MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT! We had plans to visit another Indian restaurant down the street but walked by Bibiji last night and were drawn in by the ambience and smell of good food. This is by far the best Indian food I’ve ever had in my life. The crispy cauliflower and coconut curry have made Bibiji my new favorite restaurant! The customer service was amazing.  Our waiter was so attentive, friendly and welcoming. He took time to answer every  menu question and give good recommendations.I do not live in Santa Barbara but will definitely be making the drive back for Bibiji.<//review>

<text>Stopped in without a reservation, sat quickly even though it was a little busy. Everything we got was delicious!! Staff recommendations for food and wine were exactly what we were looking for.  Romantic ambiance,  great service,  great food, would definitely go back again!!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmPhr3wQgPguAPdCISMTJJ3_Y0RYQKu1bLZ8Q9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

VERY LOUD MUSIC. We had a reservation. The music outside was so loud that it made it almost impossible to have a conversation. I asked the guy who seated us if he could turn it down. No action. Our waiter came up, he said he could not turn the music down. I asked if I could speak to the manager. Who turned out to be the first guy I asked. And he refused to turn the volume down. Completely Rude. No interest in customer satisfaction. All of the other dinners seated outside were clearly not enjoying the loud music. So we left, used OpenTable, and found another much better and quieter restaurant a few blocks away.<//text>

An interesting take on Indian food, I was glad to have tried it although I'm not sure I would go back. Some of the dishes were great - the paneer Tikka sliders and fried cauliflower were good. The uni biryani rice looks impressive but isn't that great a dish. The dahl makhani was fine but not as tasty as many others I have had. The service was attentive, but the decor looks like it was a club in the 90s and hasn't been redesigned since. There are really not many vegetarian dishes, which is frustrating for an Indian restaurant in California!</Text>

Amazing butter chicken. The vegetarian options were very limited and didn’t taste very good. Didn’t get a chance to try wines. Music was extremely loud for the size of the place.<//Review>

<Text>Wow. Even as takeout, the curries and tandoori toolkit are fantastic. Chicken was cooked so perfectly. Highly recommend the Halibut Coconut Curry. Staff gave fantastic recommendations for wine pairing and were super accommodating.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Wow, we are stoked BiBI Ji opened in Santa Barbara. This is one of our favorite restaurants! Great for groups or for a date. The food is mouth watering incredible! I recommend the tasting menu. You get to try a bunch of there dishes and it's just the right amount of options. They have the best Sea Urchin in town. As you can see in my photo. Under all the yummy urchin is tasting rice. I also think they have the best fish dish in town. Must try the cauliflower small plate as well. I could go on naming dishes. Great wine program and beer options! We have always had great service and they have a cool vibe and atmosphere.</text><Name>Misty Orman<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Service is atrocious. First the host/server said there were no availabilities. Then he said they actually had availability but that I couldn’t expect good service. Then he said to expect a little extra time between courses. Sounds like he wanted an excuse not to serve us<//Text>

< Review>
Modern Indian food that utilizes local organic produce and seafood, with an amazing natural wine list, in a fun atmosphere. Staff is knowledgable and helpful in navigating the entirely organically and sustainably farmed wines. Love the Uni Biryani, tandoori salmon, and all of the curries, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.</Review>

Their modern take on traditional Indian dishes and ingredients, combined with an incredible wine selection, makes Bibi Ji my top restaurant in Santa Barbara. Each dish presents a unique twist while still preserving the authentic flavors one hopes to find in Indian cuisine. As a local, I appreciate that so many of the ingredients are grown, caught, and bought locally. I have never been disappointed by the food or the service. Bomb. 10/10 would recommend. Fire.<//review>

<text>The best Indian food I’ve ever had by far! Went on my birthday and was so happy. Mr. Tso’s Cauliflower was perfect. Everything was delicious down to the perfectly warmed naan and rice. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you like to try interesting and good food I can’t recommend this place enough. Please bring a location to LA, but I’ll still gladly come back to Santa Barbara to eat here again.</text>< pics>

< Review>
Strange mix between classic Indian and a modern style bar. Indian pics/paintings/food and cheap radio-style electronic house music? O_o

Food was OK (lamb was fair, not much taste, chicken was good), glass of wine was very small, but everything was pretty expensive -- for what it was. Waitresses seemed nice but also in a rush to get us out since closing time was approaching. They didn't have this classic Indian beer that my friend always gets.

Overall, crazy expensive for the food and service they offer. Definitely not coming back.</Review>

I honestly there's nothing truly awful here.
The service was acceptable, but not great.
The food was solid, but for such a limited menu and the price tag,  it should have been a contender for the best in Santa Barbara.
The atmosphere was trying to hard to be trendy and nightcluby, not to my liking, but that's just my taste, I don't dock them points here.

Of the wines I recognized, they were severally marked up from retail, and the $20 dollar corking fee makes it impossible to get a decent glass of wine here.

The beer, while competitively priced, was poorly displayed. There were no clear indicators to what types of beer they had. No tasting notes, no name plates, not even clear break down of types. From what I could tell they had IPAs and Saisons. While it was a wide selection within those categories, I felt it to be boring and uninspired, because they all seemed to flow together within the display.

All that being said, the real tragedy here is it seems like they have good ideas, but haven't taken the time to refine them or flesh them out. I hope they are able to really make the place shine.<//text>

The most unique experience I’ve ever had trying something new. The food was amazing and delicious and we tried close to everything on the menu.  I was so impressed with the food and it’s presentation. The service was the best . Total dining experience  with some of the best wine I’ve had in Santa Barbara county! This place is a must try! You won’t be disappointed! I truely felt the care that went into making the meals. Can’t wait to go back!</Review>

This place was just OK.  It was ranked very high in SB restaurants.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala.  It was a big plate of chicken.  Not a curry.  My girlfriend ordered the paneer.  It was a bowl of fried cheese.  Not a curry.  This restaurant is some sort of American Indian fusion - but the recipes were not fused all that well.  Doubt I will go back.  On a positive note, atmosphere and service was very good (which is why this is three stars and not two).<//Text>

Amazing food! After my first visit, it's now one of my top choices in Santa Barbara. This is what a talented modern chef can do with Indian Food. The food is spicy, but the spice is not overpowering. Great, clean flavors on everything we tried. It seemed very healthy as well.

I'll be back many more times...</text>

The food was very disappointing.  We ordered the chef's special. Most dishes arrived at table either cool or cold.  One dish, cauliflower, arrived scaldingly hot. Also delivery of food was haphazard at best.  To be fair the staff was very friendly but something seemed very off about experience.  I've eaten at many Indian restaurants and this is the first that offers beef on menu.  I was a bit taken aback.  Maybe I misunderstand the concept.  I guess this wouldn't matter if the food was served hot and with efficiency.  I wish them the best as SB could use some more interesting dining options but it would take a lot to convince me to go back.< /Text>

<Review>This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in SB and especially to do with Indian food on the west coast. Yes the recipes are not traditional but all the fusion is well worth the try since the chef seems to have perfected winning formula no matter the ingredients. From the uni biryani to the chefs tasting, every morsel was delish. Definitely give yourself time to enjoy a well paced meal here. Your taste buds will need it.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Bibi Ji is the latest restaurant to occupy this location, and unfortunately, it misses the mark. I long for the days of Rudy's where locals and tourists alike were treated as respected guests of this establishment, but alas, new ownership has taken to create a hostile environment for its guests. A few things stood out as odd to me from reading the menu alone, details that I could not reconcile, and our "server" had difficulty answering. This is the kind of place that has many arbitrary rules, and hiked-up fees, purposefully confusing at best, pretentiousness more likely being the culprit of this self-described "unauthentic" Indian food restaurant. Soda: $5. Bread (naan): $5. Wine bottle: $40 to-go, $60 with meal ($20 corkage fee). Attitude from owner and server: FREE!</text>

<text>Our waitress was Jessi, but I only know that because the receipt said so. I don't know who Jessi is, because our service was awful, and we kept getting different staff to help us. After a 15-20 minute wait of sitting at our table, and no one even checking in on us, the Chef came to take out order. Then a different person brought the food, a third person brought water, and a fourth brought the check, when we were finally able to flag someone down (again, after sitting at an empty table, after eating, all the staff walked by us without checking in on us).

The food is good, but the lack of staff / staff actually doing anything made this a place I won't be coming back to.< /text>< gmap_id>

We had the tandoori chicken and the butter chicken. The butter chicken was good and the tandoori chicken was one of the best tandoori chicken dishes I ever had. The kulfi popsicle was also interesting. This is a small place, so, making a reservation is very much recommended. This place also has a bar with a nice selection of wine. The music was ok for a bar but too loud for a restaurant! And the place also seemed bit pricey for the ambience and the portions offered.< /Review><username>Pritam Ganguly</username><Time>1559654309770</Time>< rate>

{'time': 1553480716433, 'text': 'Hello Vikku,\n\nTo clarify your review, I am the one you spoke with, and am the owner. Your group of 14 which was booked for a prefixed menu and confirmed with a credit card, arrived 45 minutes late. We left you a confirmation voicemail to confirm the patio seating last Wednesday and never received a call back. We are a small restaurant and this is the only way we can accommodate such a large party. This was also reconfirmed when you called to say that you would be late 5 minutes before your expected arrival. I can assure you that our wine list is put together with much consideration and we stand by the quality of each bottle. Our sommelier allotted the pours based on the number of members in your group. Those two bottles were the bottles that you personally asked to pay for on your card. You were asked to leave the restaurant for members of your party being disrespectful and belittling our staff. You brought one of our senior and well-seasoned waitresses, Pam, to tears due to your lack of respect. Our idea of hospitality does not include tolerating anyone speaking to our staff the way that she was spoken to. I personally had to ask different members of your group to take their hands off of me twice. We will be thoroughly and professionally documenting the situation and reviewing the footage to use this as a training tool for our staff. We asked you to leave as the situation had escalated to the point that your party was disturbing other guests in the dining room and it was clear that there was not going to be a satisfactory resolution. You were no longer welcome in our restaurant, nor will you be in the future.'}</Response>
<Text>We chose this restaurant based on the fact this place was part-owned by renowned sommelier Rajat Parr. We were a large party of 14 that had made a reservation well ahead of time and had traveled from Los Angeles with plenty of expectations.
Unfortunately, our experience from the get-go was disappointing. In spite of making a reservation well in advance, we were seated in the patio in the rear of the restaurant with insufficient heaters. We knew it was a set-menu but no one presented us with the menu or explained what we were getting. The wine choices were terrible and above all the attitude of the waitress was rude at every turn and unacceptable. When one of us tried talking to the co-owner, he was rude and clearly did not want us at the restaurant at which point we all just walked out without eating food here. There were no apologies of any sort, instead, the owner charged us a ridiculous price for two lousy bottles of wine that were opened but we just tasted.
For a restaurant that is owned by a reputed sommelier, it needs to be run professionally and needs to understand customer service. Extremely disappointing experience overall!!!<//Text>< Date>

<Text>One of our friends, a member of our wine tasting group of 7 couples, made reservations to this place upon recommendation of the restaurant's Sommelier co-owner.

This was much anticipated by all of us, as this was at the end of our amazing wine-tasting trip limited to Santa Barbara/Happy and Ballard Canyon region. This included brunch at the Four Seasons, and wine tasting at Crown Point and Kimsey's. Both vineyards were specially opened for our group on a Saturday by their respective owners as private events.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, the place appeared very small with a row of deuces facing a bar in the middle. Foursomes in the corners. A cooler for soft drinks/Beers was installed towards the back, a sight more typical for a fast-food place. We were then ushered to the back, which I assumed would be private room for 14 people, turned out to be an open EXIT concrete patio with barely two heaters. "Holy Grail" of Indian curries Or NOT. The place made other so called "Hole-in-the walls" look like Four Seasons.

Our lady server, who claimed to be the Chef's wife, appeared to be in a hurry. Never made us feel welcome, didn't tell us about the menus, didn't hand us out the menus and appeared Patronizing at best.

From then on the situation turned for the worse. Our friend asked the server if he could charge his discharged phone (the only phone that had the contact info of the Limo Driver), the server flatly refused. Our friend's wife then approached the Owner and explained the situation and that we would all have to leave if the phone remained discharged. He grudgingly agreed to charge the phone.

Server came back upset that we dared approach the manager, claiming that she never refused the phone charging to begin with!! A few minutes later the Owner came back and confronted my friend's wife aggressively saying that SHE had made the server cry!!!  When our friends tried to find an explanation for their rudeness and bizarre behavior, the Owner's response was "SO WHAT"!!!!

Suffice to say that we all left that place, despite the fact that our friend had pre-paid for the meal for the whole group. Couldn't Risk any further Disrespect and Insults for our well meaning Group.

Interesting at best. Service at worst. Wish we had read the reviews of this place prior to making the reservation. The common thread of the negative reviews were: Rude nonchalant service. Unresponsive Management. Over-priced Menu for a mediocre establishment and Poor Service.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Dear owner.
We made this reservation partly to support an Indian icon Rajat Parr. He is very well revered in the Indian community and we are proud of him. Unfortunately for us, your lack of hospitality and your anger and resentment towards your clients was obvious to us and you have made a fine case of it with your lame excuses.
Just so that you know, we did not travel with any agenda and only wanted to support you. Between all of us, we have never walked out of a restaurant. Your aggressive attitude feared us that you would give us unhealthy food. Your continued anger confirms that.  You could feel that there is conspiracy against you, but all you need to see is that the overwhelming majority 11/20 of the last recent yelp reviews you have had are either a dismal 1 or 3.
Yes, you can believe that the world hates you. But a quick reality check, you are not made out to be an owner. Hope Rajat realizes this soon. You need a reality check for abusing your clients who have overwhelming given you a bad grade.
Generally, I would like to give you constructive criticism, but you are way past that. Not even in our wildest nightmare we would like to visit your establishment many of your previous guests have predicted that you will be out of business by the end of the year. While we hope the best for an Indian restaurant, we don’t see much hope for you. To quote another one of your previous glorious reviews”not a good strategy to upset Indian customers ar an Indian restaurant “ by Pranjali T a month ago.

Bibi Ji deserves 0 stars.  1 star is too generous.

Absolutely the worst dining  experience I have ever had. The waitress is not knowledgeable about the menu and has a very bad attitude towards guests.  I’ve never been to a restaurant where the waitress is unwilling to inform what will be served as part of a  pre-set menu.
She was very unhelpful and argumentative towards us for every small thing and made us feel very unwelcome.

The manager was no less. He actually came to the table and said the waitress was very distressed due to us asking her too many questions.

We actually left the restaurant without having our dinner and on our way out we were told by the manager that he’d call the police on us if we didn’t leave right away.

This has to be by far the most unclassy  Indian or any other restaurant you’ll ever go to.  Better to take your money elsewhere , Bibi Ji does not deserve to be in business.

Very surprising that this place is co-owned by sommelier Rajat Parr. One would expect a staff with proper training In hospitality and class.
Hope he reads this and all other negative reviews and makes the staff apologize for ruining our evening.<//Text>

Don't let the trendy atmosphere, projected-video-on-the-wall, and Downtempo music fool you.  With so many opportunities for Bibi Ji to innovate with American Fusion, this restaurant falls back to hard on pretty-good Indian food to justify the really high prices.< /Review>

<text>Firstly, let me complement the Chef. The food was very good and I was satisfied. I’m vegetarian; the menu allowed for ample selection for all courses. The wine menu is also extensive, although I haven’t tried any.

The service (two twenty somethings; definitely not professionals) did not enquire as to whether I wanted my curry benign, medium, or hot. I enjoyed the meal, but it was not hot enough for my taste. This is not a criticism of the Chef, but of the service, who should be doing a lot better.

No one checked on our table. We were waiting on water for maybe 15 minutes. We also ordered a second round of naan and the server told us 20 minutes later that it would be right out. It doesn’t take 20 minutes to cook naan; he forgot. There was also a period of at least 3 full minutes when both servers/bartenders were not in the dining hall.

The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired. They’ve gone for a chic purple metropolitan design, which I like, but won’t be to more conservative tastes. Tables are not sufficiently separated for privacy in conversation. The music is also too loud, and an annoying mix of what sounded like EDM followed by 30 minutes of acoustic XX.

Beer selection on tap is poor although they do have a couple refrigerators in the corner with cans of beer, if you’re into that sort of thing.

Compared to London, 3/5.

Lack of service reflects on management, who either have hired students or have not trained them to a professional standard.<//text>< gmapID>

<text>The aesthetic is modern, with hipster vibes with the way the servers are dressed, a full bar, and interesting wall decor. The parking was what you would expect from State street. As far as the cost, I would say this would be better suited to a date night as it is on the pricier side.

The menu is limited to one page and the food is served “thali” style. The DAAL is delicious and priced very well! I loved the flavors and wish I had the recipe! I love eating daal with naan but wasn’t impressed by the size of the naan or that it was $$$$$$! Everything else I tried (other than the daal) felt overpriced and under portioned. I would, however, go back for that daal.</text><userid>115718229850353497173<//userid>< Date>

<review>So sad they stopped serving lunch. The thali was by far the best thing and I think a fancy restaurant / night only / wine bar is a bad idea .  This food a great but the business end seems so confused. Get that thali out on the street, charge $12 and sell to the average working people !!<//review><rate>1< /rate><GmapID>0x80e915f9c12c2a8d:0xb35827e71bb0ff39</GmapID>< time>

Dr Shah is the best Doctor I have seen in a long time. By far is the most thorough and attentive Doctor I have seen, period. I wish he could be my primary care provider. He truly cares about his patients. Goes above and beyond to understand their concern and get you on a path to doing better. If you are seeking a gastroenterologist, you will not find a better one than him! His team was great as well and will make you very comfortable during the process. A+ all around.<//Review>

Dr. Weinberg and staff were outstanding.  I’m not good with needles or any kind of procedure; however, the team made it an easy and pleasant  experience.  Really enjoyed how they took care of me and always asked how I was doing.  Dr. Weinberg had a caring and understanding attitude and he really gives you the confidence that all is going to be ok.   Highly recommend Dr. Weinberg and staff.< /review>

<Text>I highly recommend Dr. Shields. He has been our family physician for almost 5 years and is always available to solve our health issues, some serious and some minor. He is thoughtful and conservative with his recommendations and takes plenty of time to explain what will be involved with the treatments and the risks if any. His office staff is very professional and helpful and my appointment time is respected so there never is a wait.< /Text>< Pics>

As a Insurance Benefit Consultant, I talk to clients about the importance of having an active and transparent relationship with their primary care physician. Dr. CeciliaTran has been my trust advisor/ Physician for years and I love her approach to patient care and proactive approach to medicine.  If you’re looking to identify a quality, honest, caring doctor I recommend highly Dr. Cecilia Tran.< /Review>

<Review>I had to have a colonoscopy and a endoscopy at the same time. I was NOT looking forward to it.But everyone from the nurses,anesthesiologist and my surgeon were great.Before I knew it I was done and back in the waiting area. I would recommend Saddleback Medical Center to everyone needing excellent medical care. Especially Dr. Catherine Ngo she is wonderful.</Review>< Pictures>

Just responding to your comment: my wife had the exact same issue with you and she has been treated with absolute disrespect. I am not going to go through the same experience.

I have been a patient of Dr Benjamin Weinberg for many years. Over these years my health problems have gone up & down, and I always felt I could get in touch with his office quickly, and an get appointment as needed. Dr Weinberg always takes the time to listen, and see what is needed for my recovery. What's been most important for me during all this time, is the mental reassurance that he never gives up on me. Always gives me hope, and makes me feel he will be there to help. I warmly recommend Dr Weinberg at the Saddleback Medical Group.<//Text>

I received my new patient consult with PA, Emily Yu, a few days ago and feel fortunate to have connected with her. Emily was genuinely engaged throughout the consultation period and did not make me feel rushed. She created my plan of care so thoroughly by taking into account my concerns without any judgement. I always make note of points I plan to discuss during my medical appointments and usually leave without thorough answers but with Emily, she actually added so many things to the list and covered all I was planning to discuss without me even having to ask. Being in the healthcare profession myself, I know hitting all the check boxes of a “perfect assessment” aren’t always realistic but Emily surely did so flawlessly. I find huge comfort in knowing I’m under the care of someone who is so compassionate and professional. Saddleback Medical Group is very lucky to have Emily on their team, I know I am :)</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>My teenage daughter and I both are new patients of Dr Shah. As a small business owner who believes in providing the highest quality of customer service as the hallmark of any service offering, I very much appreciative what I’ve experienced as a customer / patient (and the parent of a customer /patient) of Dr. Shah’s. He and his team - from Natalie and Summer to Emily on the practitioner side - have been super responsive and accommodating. We had gone down the GI route a few years back with specialists that pale in comparison to what we’ve already experienced with Dr. Shah and his team at Saddleback. And the proof in the pudding (pun intended) is that my teenage daughter who has had ongoing GI issues is finally seeing light at the end of this troubling and painful tunnel. An end result that we never came close to achieving previously with a so called “first-rate GI” who was much more about ego and drawing on textbook cases than approaching the issue holistically and identifying viable, lasting solutions.  I highly recommend this team of specialists!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1607349991087, 'text': 'As a practice we always aim to provide the best care possible to patients.

A true rock star in his field and in life. He is helping me heal in ways that other doctors just dismissed and if you are feeling hesitant about getting a colonoscopy, please don't. It can save your life and it's really no big deal at all. Dr. Weinberg treats you with respect, kindness and compassion. What more could you possibly ask for in a doctor. Oh and he's super fine~! What a combo. Thank you Dr. Weinberg for who you are and all you do.

<Text>I had a very enlightening office visit with Dr. Dillon. He answered a lot of my concerns and gave me good advice on things that we talked about. I have been a patient of his for many many years and will continue to be one. For any new patients out there, I highly recommend DR. DHILLON, as he is very personable and a warm hearted individual.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1607350020334, 'text': 'As a practice we always aim to provide the best care possible to patients.

My interaction with Emily Yu, PA, was extraordinary. She was extremely professional and knowledgeable, comprehensive, patient, reassuring, and unusually personable. It’s not often that a visit to a medical professional is completely satisfying and enjoyable, but my meeting with Ms. Yu was that and more. Really a great pleasure to have met and talked with her.</text>

Dr Kim and her staff have been excellent in their professionalism, heartfelt care and support for me. Dr. Kim communicates her concerns and medical opinions in an honest, trustworthy and caring manner.  I just got a flu shot yesterday and Dr. Kim’s medical assistant is the absolute best in giving shots.  I didn’t even know she was already done!!  I would love to have the Visit Summary and Instructions printout back in their practice though.< /text>

If your looking for the best doctor in Laguna Hills that would be Dr Mark Shields. You have to meet him to know that he loves his profession. I have been with Dr Shields more than 10 years and I will not switch him. I drive an 1hour and 15min to go see him. He will treat you until you feel better. if you need a referral you with see Other doctors that love their job. I feel that’s the kind of doctors you need. The ones that care for your health. My husband and my two sons also are registered with doctor Shields. Just remember if you like the best, go see Dr Mark Shields.< /Review>

I selected doctor Zamani after reviewing several doctors in the area.  My selection criteria was mostly based on his excellent credentials and accomplishments.  In my first visit he spent almost an hour with me and examined me thoroughly.   He is very pleasant and very dedicated to his profession.   I'm glad I selected him as my primary doctor.

She listens and explains on my questions without rush. Her staff respond at the same day on my message reliably. Office visit waiting time is short. Most of all, she has a beautiful smile!< /Review>

I am so thrilled to have met Dr Weinberg. I was a new patient  to him. I called his office as my gastric enterilogost could not see me until October the 15th even though I explained that I  was in a lot of pain  He moved his schedule around to accommodate an appointment within a couple of days really caring about my well being even though he did not know me. I met him he took decisive action to try determine what was causing my discomfort  and was a breath of fresh air!! If he is so into helping his patients I look forward to a health restoring relationship with him for many years to come

I want to thank Dr. Weinbergs's team, Brian, his medical assistant, and Lindsey, his PA, for the great care, personal respect and thorough education that they provided toward my health concerns to fulfill my needs. I'm grateful and I appreciate everything you all have done in making sure your patient services were tip top!</review>

I was referred to Dr Dhillon after my long time endocrinologist moved to a concierge platform that was not affordable for me. I was very nervous about starting all over with a new doctor since my history (from the onset of thyroid disease) was with my former endocrinologist.
Dr Dhillon was extremely thorough, patient. & kind as he went through my medical history and got to know me. This is a doctor that actually listens carefully, extends empathy and offers both sound medical advice as well as practical solutions to health challenges that allow me to focus on improving my overall health, not just thyroid health. Dr Dhillon speaks from both experience and research making him an ideal medical provider who has exceeded all of my expectations in a doctor. When I need a scrip refilled or call with a medical question, I always get a prompt call back with the info needed.

It’s a great feeling knowing Dr Dhillon is on my team when it comes to monitoring my thyroid health and keeping a close eye on my overall health. He’s a doctor that shows care & concern and does not treat you like a another number!<//text>

<user>111926176940940286259<//user><Review>Dr. Zamani has been my primary care doctor for many years.  He is a very knowledgeable, competent, kind, attentive and caring doctor as well as an outstanding human being.  He really cares about me as an individual and takes a lot of time with his patients.  He explains very clearly in detail what is going on with my health situation and he asks me if I have questions – he never makes me feel rushed.  Dr. Zamani’s assistant is Nermein - she is also fantastic.  Nermein, along with the entire office staff, are very nice and professional and good to work with.  In short, I whole heartedly recommend Dr. Zamani – he is the best!< /Review>< Pictures>

I've been going to Saddleback medical group office for several years and here are some of my comments: Very friendly and efficient medical team. Great in depth explanation of lab results and what it means. Consistent follow through on medical goals to achieve optimum health. Dr. Zamani spends all the time necessary to explain condition and treatment to patient which brings peace of mind. Referral to in-network doctors for specialists when needed. Highly recommended team!< /text>

She makes you feel like a real person and understands medicine from an all inclusive life perspective giving consideration to other natural treatment options including the importance of diet and exercise for optimum health.

< Review>
Medical Assistants in the reception area are nice & helpful. The waiting area is clean & quiet. I didn’t have to wait long to be called in (usually 5-10 min) to see my doctor. Then my doctor, Dr Cecilia Tran is very pleasant, professional & compassionate with me. I like her a lot that’s why she’s my doctor for so many years already. She takes good care of my health, she makes sure all my tests & lab works are done in timely manner, that I’m taking all my medications on time. Lastly I’m very happy & contented that she’s my Primary Physician...</Review>

Dr. Dhillon was very professional yet, not a clinical attitude, just very kind and caring.
He was very thorough, asking me very pointed questions.
I would definitely recommend this practice.< /review>

Dr. Siu is hands on the best primary care doctor I have ever known.  My late mother was with him for years and felt the same
He has guided me thru recovering from a complicated group of injuries and surgeries like he was conducting a great symphony!

He took such living care of my mother and explained things so I could make good decisions for her when that time came.  He has a marvelous staff.  In particular his assistant Kim.

I could go on for hours, but the bottom line is that you would be very lucky to have Dr. siu taking care of you.!!< /Review>

Dr Sara Kim was referred to me for my 87 year old Mother-in-law by her cardiologist. We were unhappy with her previous primary care physician. Dr Kim has been a breath of fresh air! She is very personable and down to earth. She explains things in layman’s terms and is very accessible. She is very thorough and works well with my Mother-in-laws other doctors and care givers. I highly, highly recommend her to anyone!</text>

<Text>I have been a patient of Dr. Weinberg for a few years. Last year I had a lot of stomach issues & had an exam, blood tests including a CT scan & scopes. Dr. Weinberg found some problems and prescribed meds. Dr. Weinberg called me with my CT results & recommended a surgeon. I greatly appreciated his aggressive approach to my problems. Thankfully, I had my surgery with Dr. William Wallace & I am much better. Recently I had a virtual visit with his PA, Lindsey Gelber to discuss my prescription. She was very knowledgeable & we had a good long visit. I recommend this practice.<//Text>< pics>

Dr. Henry has been my doctor for over 20 years. I’ve never felt rushed so he could move on to the next patient. He listens and answers all my questions. He helps me understand the how and the why. This office also has its own lab. I would never consider going to anyone else.</Review>

I have been seeing Dr. V for almost 20 years. Over the past 15 years I have referred Dr. V to my wife, 2 co-workers, and my aunt (he is still all of their primary physician).  He is an amazing Dr, cares greatly about his patients, and you can tell he loves when he does!!! I'd definitely recommend him if he is accepting new patients.</text>

<date>1590179142899</date><text>Dr. Ly is very nice and easy to talk to. However, he's also comes across as only dialysis driven. He can't see anything else. I have lost over 50ibs of weight and he hasn't been motivating and encouraging. No other diet recommendations, nothing that could help benefit the kidneys better. Only sees dialysis even though their % fluctuates, but are hanging on. Last conversation really disturbed me because he saw no positivity, as usual, and he brought my morale down and it was discouraging. I felt extremely sad and it took a few days to motivate myself back up. He doesn't listen and isn't positive. I am seeking another positive, happy Doc because I don't need discouragement when I'm already stressed over my function. Keeping it real doesn't mean not lifting up the soul in your clients.< /text><UserId.>109844395595714167550<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

. From my very first appointment with Dr. Henry I knew he was the perfect choice for our General Practioner. He is very friendly, easy to talk with,  attentive,  he doesn't miss a thing that I say. He is also very knowledgeable.
I was in to see Dr. Henry the other day regarding a nagging problem and he quickly resolved the issue. In addition to that I had several other questions that he patiently answered even though I might have been putting him behind. Thanks Dr. Henry.
Believe it or not, I actually look forward to seeing him. I know that whatever is bothering me is going to get resolved.
I would highly recommend Dr. Henry<//text></record>

<Text>After each visit with Dr. Maziar Zamani, my wife and I look at each other and say” Let’s see what new thing we have learned today. It is unbelievable how our  Dr. is so knowledgeable. Every time we visit him, we learn something new.
Dr. Zamani has been our family physician for more than fifteen years. During all this time, he has not only taken care of our health, but he has been our friend and our medical teacher. We have a peace of mind knowing that he is always one phone call away. He is honest about our medical issues. His advice comes in a very human way that we take it by heart. He explains our concerns in detail and in a very good humor way that keeps us happy. He is calm, friendly and observant. He asks “ Is there any problem that we talk about ?”. After listening carefully he gives his opinion and his advice that is so precious to us.
We thank Dr. Zamani for his compassion, the time that he takes to spend with us to explain in detail, all our issues during our visit. We are lucky to have Dr. Zamani, as our family physician, as a friend and as a great advisor.
Dr. Zamani, we greatly appreciate your compassion and understanding and that you have taken care of us for so many years.
Thank you for your empathy and your continuous support to keep us in good shape.

After the internet search to select our family doctor, my wife and I decided to visit Dr. Kim’s office. Dr. Kim was very thorough in screening our health issues and deciding what need to be done. We feel very lucky to find her as our family doctor.</review>

Dr. Nathaniel Ho is the most caring, knowledgeable, and professional physician.  During COVID-19, he has been very accessible, especially through Telemedicine.  He is still able to see his patients through various platforms.  My Mother saw him last week on Zoom.  Dr. Ho saved her life once and she has been with him ever since.  We continue to drive 60 miles just to see him.  I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Ho and his practice!  We love his staff as well, Serene and Sandy in particular.<//Text>

Dr. Zamani is among the top physicians with whom I have been associated. He's very, very knowledgeable, warm, professional, patient, and always willing to gather information if further details are needed. He is an expert Internal Medicine specialist.<//Review>

Dr. Weinberg is amazing. I had suffered from gastrointestinal issues since I was 18 years old without answers. I am now 40 years old and have an accurate diagnosis. He was able to work with a infection disease peer and give me a plan for treatment. My husband recently had diverticulitis and Dr. Weinberg took time off his lunch break to come to the hospital and check on him. We are so thankful for him and his team. We highly recommend him.<//text>

I am a new patient. It took a little while to get my first appointment, but that is not unusual for some specialist. I was worried that my appointment scheduled for June 1 might be delayed due to Covid19. It wasn’t. Dr Dhillon set up a phone consultation. He was very attentive and did not rush me at all. I have a few different issues going on and he took interest in all of them. I was very pleased with the advice I was given and tests were ordered. The staff was very friendly which is important to me after working in medical office for 50 years.< /review>

The location is convenient and parking is provided in a garage. The front desk handled my sign in and registration promptly. Dr. Ngo is very professional and personable which is important since I’ve never met her before. The checkout was also handled very efficiently. Hopefully I will find that the procedure will go as well.<//Text>

I had to see Dr. Sara Kim for vertigo which I knew had started with ear problems.  Because of covid situation,  the office is only seeing patients for emergency or special situations.  I could tell as soon as I walked in to the building that Saddleback Medical Group takes the covid situation seriously.  I felt very good about that even though for some of us, the precautions might be too much.  Thank you Saddleback Medical Group for doing your best and ensuring your patients are safely served.

When I checked in to Dr. Kim's office,  all the clerks are wearing masks and they seem to have scheduled patients in a way that the office is seeing patients without the patients having to get close to other patients.

Dr. Kim is the best!  She takes time to explain any concerns I might have and explains things in layman's terms. I highly recommend her.< /text>

Dr. Leish is a caring physician. Whenever I have gone to seek help he made me feel as if I am the only patient he will see today. He listens and then asks me if I have more things to say. Then he examines the area of discomfort and describes what is causing the pain or discomfort. He never forgets to remind about daily or as suited exercise. He does not push medications if I do not wish to opt for latest one. Whenever he receives lab results he cares to call me and let me know of the results and prescribe drug if needed. I am lucky to have him as my PCP. He gets appointments with the specialists as needed.
His office staff is equally caring . I never had to wait for appointments or in the office on the date of appointments. Thanks to them also.</review>

I called to make an appointment and I was ask the routine questions, name, date of birth and insurance.  When it came the what type of insurance I have the receptionist said I needed to contact my insurance company.  When I tried to tell her that even if the doctor was out of network, which he's not, she rudely replied, "that's not how it works."  Every doctor that I've gone to has taken my insurance information to verify the co-pay and whether or not the insurance would cover the office visit.   Very poor and rube customer service on Saddleback Medical Group's behalf. I will avoid going to any of the doctors that practice there.<//Text>

The Group provides excellent care. All the Doctors and Nurses have excellent “bedside manners”. The Group are very good Listeners. They even smile at my attempt at humor. As a Group, they complement each other. They are very Professional.< /Text>

Whether my visit is in person, with an on call Dr over the phone, or a tel-appointment with my Dr over the phone, all calls are returned promptly at the appointed time. The Drs have reviewed my chart before seeing me or calling me. They take the time to listen and provide excellent medical care.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

This was my first telephone appointment, and everything went very smoothly. Dr. Dhillon had all my records and recent lab results. He was pleased with my diabetic control, as was I. The visit was complete, and return appointment with appropriate labs was arranged. I was completely satisfied with this arrangement, and avoiding possible Covid exposure made this the safest encounter possible.</Text>

Really grateful to have been seen by Dr. Weinberg. He has a great bedside manner and gets to the point.

Very difficult times we are living in, and I was not expecting much in the way of health care.

They proved to me that I can trust this group of medical professionals.

They are on time, know what is going on and when you need excellent healthcare, they are there!<//Text>

<Text>Dr. Emily went over the dosage of my prescription Famotidine.
She discussed my symptom of feeling like there is an air bubble leading the way down my esophagus when I swallow liquids sometimes. I was interested and somewhat reassured to know I have a length of throat tissue that is scarred/hardened, so-to-speak, that could cause this sensation.
I can also swallow 2 tsp. of Gaviscon Advance more often than just before bedtime to neutralize alcohol or acidic/fatty foods. I found this telemedicine appointment to be just as beneficial as an in-house appointment.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Dr. Scarcella has been my primary care provider for more than three years. He is an exceptional physician, and I recommend him without reservation. Dr. Scarcella's annual physicals are the most thorough I have ever encountered. No detail is overlooked and there is never a sense of allotted time per patient. He explains clearly and welcomes questions, acting as a partner in the patient's health care, respecting patient self-knowledge and experience. He reaches out by phone in a timely manner with lab results or follow-up information. Dr. Scarcella's positive interpersonal skills also put the patient at ease.<//text>< user_name>

Lynn Granlund and the other doctors and their assistants at Saddleback Medical Group are taking great care of me.  Dr. Granlund is unbelievably quick in responding to any questions I have - love using the "portal".  She is the fastest doctor I've ever had at getting any referrals I need to see specialist.  Very caring, knowledgeable and I never feel rushed.< /Review>

SO grateful to have found Dr. STERNS as our Primary Care Provider.   I worked in Healthcare in Los Angeles before moving to Laguna Woods to oversee my aging Mother’s health. How fortunate THAT turned out to be because this is how we met Dr. Sterns.

With my years of experience in Internal Medicine and Nephrology Management, I am very aware of what it takes to be a great doctor, an acute diagnostician, a compassionate ally, and the central person to coordinate a patient’s care from all avenues (Specialists, Labs, Imaging, Hospital) to make the best treatment plan.  We found this in Dr. Sterns.

For the past 10 years now he has been overseeing our own health during our senior years (a time of Life that we need his experience the most).  His referrals are made with great attention to linking us with the best specialists, he has a great memory, he comes prepared to our appointments with our medical history fresh in his mind, has a full command of medical records, and importantly, he is extremely responsive to our medical needs. He is also very adept at several office procedures that many Primary Care Providers don’t render.  The Office Staff is very accommodating and kind and efficient.

He took such good care of my Mother; she made it pretty close to 100 with a high quality of life.  We now share that same Trust she had in him and look forward to having our health managed by Dr. Sterns for many healthy years to come.< /Text>

I’m a healthy happily retired 71 year old Golfer and Volunteer worker for a nonprofit active in Mediation at  Orange County Superior Court...all was well until I experienced two life threatening medical emergencies in one week in May 2020.  I had Over a decade of Medical Care with Memorial Medical Specialists like Dr. Shilpa Gaikwad MD my Primary Physician and Dr. Catherine Ngo MD my GI Specialist.  Memorial Medical Group had the Medical team to evaluate my Medical emergency and quick action and a Medical procedure by Dr. C. Ngo Clearly identified the source of my health emergency and the resulting treatments and plan to bring me back to excellent health in the coming weeks.  I was fortunate that the ambulance delivered me to Saddleback Hospital and Dr. C. Ngo and her team of Memorial Medical Professionals... And their quick action put me on the path to health and my active Retirement.</text>

<Text>I recently met Dr. Sara Kim for an initial visit. She is very friendly, professional, & made me feel at ease. Several weeks later, in the midst of Covid 19, I found myself in need of her guidance, & was given a virtual office visit date /time. Well, sure enough, I missed my appointment, & called to apologize leaving a message. I now figured all was said & done...However, not only did Dr. Kim try to call again the following day, but several times until reaching me, to give me the support & her expert opinion I so needed. I'm thankful to have found Dr. Sara Kim, & would whole heartedly recommend her as an excellent Physician, & compassionate Care Provider. Respectfully submitted, V Redmon.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1590067133975, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review!'}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dce8ec703818a7:0x8f613df0e39610b1< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>I an my family have been with Doctor Mark Shields and Saddleback Medical Group for over 25 years and have alway had a great medical and group association together.

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I’m been going to Daniel McKenzie for years.  He helped me when I had a skin rash and was trying to figure out why for three years with other doctors.   I was referred to Dr. McKenzie and he’s the first one to take the biopsy and let me know that it was skin cancer.  He referred me to a plastic surgery because it was on my temple.  It was taken care of with a scar and I have been going to him since then and I will continue to go to Dr. McKenzie because I trust him. He also does an excellent job with Botox.</text>< pics>

<time>1585861194484</time><Text>My visits with Zamani have been extremely positive. He listens attentively, forms evidence  based opinions filtered through his professional experience and educates the patient and has a POA at the end of visit. His manner is calm with friendly demeanor. He takes time to listen to all dimensions of the issue and peppers some of his own experiences in his advice.
He seems  technologically adept and responsive to electronic communications for the less timely matters.
His assistant, Nermein Kassab, while sometimes overworked with a great number of requests is professional, accurate and effective in her position. In one instance she informed me of Good RX which decreased my cost on one or two drugs.
Overall, a good team.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1590066998206, 'text': 'Thanks for the positive feedback!'}< /resp><gmapID>0x80dce8ec703818a7:0x8f613df0e39610b1</gmapID>< Rating>

<rating>5< /rating><review>My experiance is with Dr. David N. Rios.

My family  and many friends have had the pleasure if being cared for by Dr. Rios, for many years.

He also takes whatever time is required to not only treat our ills but also makes sure you understand why is doing so.

Often he brings up novel information because of constant medical researh.

I would give Dr. RIos my highest recommendation.<//review>< gmap_id>

After abdominal ultrasound I have not heard back from the physician or any one from the doctor’s office. So I have no ideas what’s my medical status. Communication is important when patient is anxious to know what’s going on.</Text>

This is my 2nd appt. with Dr. Fernandez and I’m very happy. I had injured my hip in 2015 & told my Doctor at that time & he called it arthritis a year later I crush the disc at the L-5, S-1 & he called it arthritis again. In both cases no xrays or MRI. I struggled with these injuries until I was fed up with the Hoag saint joes net work & found Dr. Fernandez who ordered a MRI. I now have a course of action for moving forward. He is not an Obama care Taco Bell fast food Doctor, which seems that’s what many Doctors have become as a result of tooooo much Government in the medical fields.  Most Doctors have to be a 5 minute specialist so they have time to fill out all of the government paper work that is pushed on them.</text>
