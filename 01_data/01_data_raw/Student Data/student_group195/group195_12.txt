They take great pains to explain the process and procedure and make the kids feel comfortable. Dr. Chong is very good in his treatment. Both my kids have an awesome set of teeth and a great smile. The office staff is also commendable- friendly, good with kids and good at their respective jobs- right from reception, to billing to the doctors assistants.
Thank you Dr. Chong and team!

Dr.Chong and the staff are very welcoming and I would highly recommend any of my family members or friends to go there. I really had a good time while I was there and if I could I wouldn’t mind getting my braces done again.< /Review>

I’m so happy that I chose Dr. Chong’s team three years ago. My wife and I started ortho treatment together and mine was officially removed two weeks ago. Everyone in Dr. Chong’s office is friendly and caring and I totally enjoyed my experience! I am very happy about the treatment result and would recommend anyone of any age to see Dr. Chong.< /Text>

We’ve gone to Dr. Chong’s office for all three of my girls and I can’t tell you how happy we were with their final results. Dr. Chong and staff become like family. They are very professional and clean.Whenever we have any concerns (broken brackets lol) they accommodate us with an appointment. Dr. Chong really wants to make sure your happy with the results with no rush on treatment.  Ivette and His front desk staff are very sweet and welcoming. Will definitely recommend this office.<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Chong's expertise and professionalism is ultimate and which we can feel strongly after every appointment. During pandemic, I can't accompany my son inside the office and I was bit nervous about it. Seeing my teenager so relaxed, satisfied and happy after the procedure gives me extensive comfort.
The fact really surprised me when my son doesn't complain pain or any kind of discomfort after appointment, I strongly believe its Dr. Chong's experience and passion towards his profession. I shouldn't forget his kind heartedness and friendly nature. Its been more than a year now and  we appreciate  the entire staff for providing an amazing experience.
I want to add here, Dr. Chong is handling the case ruined by another orthodontics' of town. I feel so proud of my decision to have Dr. Chong as my son's orthodontics. Such a grounded person.< /Review>< user>

I've been a patient since I had braces as a teenager, and they have always taken very good care of me. Dr. Chong has a quick wit and great sense of humor; the staff is knowledgeable and makes you feel comfortable. They are a joy to visit!<//review>

Honestly, the best Ortho ever! Professional, clean, and great atmosphere. When I first went here myself, I had the pleasure meeting DR Leonard,  he was so nice, friendly  and really cared for my concerns. So when I was ready I came back to this place because of him! I  brought my daughter in for braces  as well and we loved it since. It's a good feeling to know that your kids are in great hands and if any of us need to come back, we will come here. I truly appreciate your team Dr. Chong!<//review>

<review>My son is just finishing his treatment with Dr. Chong and it has been a great experience from day one. Dr. Chong was very thorough with his treatment. What impressed me most was that he really took the time to hear what my son (then 16) had to say about his treatment, explaining to him all the pros and cons of every option so he had input on his own treatment   The front office staff are friendly and welcoming and do their best to accommodate our crazy schedule. (Shout out to Ivette! She's the best! - down to earth, engaging and just an all around great personality). The location is a major plus, as my son could go  to appts in the early morning or right after school which is literally a block down the street.</review>< pics>

My daughter said she will miss the office they are very nice and make her laugh.  The kids teeth are beautiful.  I highly recommend their office,  we personally had a great experience.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Dr. Chong and his team are awesome! My son got his Cross-Bite fixed with braces from Dr. Chong. The check-in is easy by tapping your name on the iPad. They schedule your next appointment one and/or two months in advanced which is great for me because I like to plan and organize my life ahead (especially with 3 little kids!) They have an area for your child to brush their teeth prior to their appointment (which is great when you’re picking them up straight from school). They also have books and toys for little siblings to play in the lobby. I love them!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<username>Matthew Edmondson<//username><Text>From the moment you walk in the door, the Professionalism and Outstanding service from Dr Chong begins with his staff. They are always welcoming, friendly, attentive and accomodating to scheduling times of future appointments down to their billing of partial payments. Dr Chong took the time to answer every question we had and while showing us the X-rays,he explained in great detail what was needed and why and what we could expect from final result. The final result was simply spectacular and stunning. My oldest daughter now 18 got her braces on at 11 and her teeth looked like she chewed on rocks and would rarely smile. Now her smile is the first thing you notice 24/7 and the confidence it gave her I believe played a large part in her winning Homecoming Queen her Senior year! My 13 yr old daughter just had hers removed yesterday after about a year and a half and couldn't stop smiling and fell asleep that way. Thank you Dr Chong for your continued Excellent work and helping to transform and make such a profound difference in the lives of those you treat.</Text><GmapID>0x808f957b86117df3:0xfb76e4139848bcfc</GmapID></record>

Dr.Chong is very professional, easy to talk to and care for his patients.
My two daughters went to Dr. Chong and very happy with the whole processes & results. Specially when my younger daughter had a sone dental issue before the treatment started, he was giving us great advises and worked with her pediatric dentist for us.
Highly recommend!< /review>

<Text>My son is the actual person who had gotten braces from DR S. Chong; son of the late DR L. Chong, who we also had the pleasure of meeting, but I would highly recommend DR S. Chong.  My son had a severe under bite that was completely corrected.
Pros: DR S. Chong is personable, friendly, and shows he likes the kids; the staff is also very helpful and understanding; procedure of getting the braces is explained in depth and not hurried; they give out after-care items needed to care for the braces freely, and if there is a issue with the braces, they quickly set time for your child to get seen. Although it is costly, they allow a payment plan that works for you.  They also have free parking in the back. Office is very clean, always. Easy to find corner location.
Cons: Not entirely their fault because insurance is a problem that plagues our nation, the co-payment is quite high; they have short hours, and limited schedule availability; braces are a long process, so your child will have to return for many visits for 2 to 3 years; and you might have to listen to your child complain initially until they become accustomed to it.
My son is so happy now that his teeth are straight. On to my other children.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>5<//rate><time>1519886275954<//time><Gmap_id>0x808f957b86117df3:0xfb76e4139848bcfc< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Dr. Scott Chong and his very friendly staff are all excellent, very professional, thorough, and caring.  During my treatment,  I received all the supplies needed for good dental protection and hygiene.  I loved the surprise gifts given after my braces were removed.  I also appreciate Dr. Chong's long term aftercare plan, to assist with keeping my teeth the straightest it's ever been.  I highly recommend Chong Orthodontics for a great outcome and if you wish to avoid having braces more than once like I did.</Review>< Pics>

Amazing Experience and affordable too! Dr. Chong sits down with you and explains the process of braces step by step! Had my braces on for 3 years and he said I can come back and get a check up anytime even after the services have already been completed. Very nice staff overall and would highly recommend!< /review>

I had not been to an Orthadontist since I was a teenager and when my permanent retainer wire broke and I needed to go and see one again I was really nervous. When I searched around and called different places, this was the only place that made me feel so comfortable over the phone. Dr. Chong, as well as everyone that worked there, was extremely nice and bent over backwards to make me comfortable. The icing on the cake was when dr. Scott was kind enough to squeeze me in and fixed my bar even though it was only supposed to be a consultation meeting!!!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone!!! You will get royal treatment!!!<//review>

All of my dealings with Dr. Scott Chong have been very positive.  He is very knowledgeable on all things having to do with orthodontics and has a way of explaining things to a layperson that makes it easy to understand.  I am not a patient, but if I were in the Fremont area I would not hesitate to use Dr. Chong. I  recommend his practice to anyone.</Text>

<review>I have been a patient of Chong Orthodontics for over 25 years.  Drs. Leonard and Scott Chong have always made sure that my teeth are looking their best from having braces both upper and lower, headgear, to continually checking to see if my retainers need adjusting. They have taken the time to make sure I was comfortable and understood how to care for my braces and retainers. The staff at Chong Orthodontics have always been so welcoming and on top of things when I come in for an appointment. I highly recommend them to anyone needing orthodontic care.

A special thanks to Drs. Leonard and Scott for the great service they provide to their patients.</review>< gmapID>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Really, REALLY, good wings

I stopped in on a whim tonight and decided to try their "dry rubbed" chicken wings because I really don't like "wet" wings with sauce dripping off of them. I asked for ranch dressing because there's nothing like a dry wing dipped in something wet ... I think they're the best chicken wings I've ever had.

They're deep fried but that I think in super hot oil so they're crispy but not greasy. They're pretty decent-sized too. The "rub", kind of like seasoning salt, is tasty without being too spicy. The ranch dressing i got with them might be house made I'm not sure but it's a notch above the stuff that comes in a bottle from the supermarket. The wings also came with some carrot and celery sticks. It was a very enjoyable meal.

They have outdoor dining but my shop is just down the road so I got them to go.<//Review>< userid>

Awesome BBQ takeout

Saw the special offering takeout of the BBQ dinner and ordered for delivery. This was great. Came with ribs, chicken, pulled pork, plenty of sauces, potato salad, beans, cornbread and coleslaw. Couldn't get any better than this. We had food for several meals. All of it delicious. My Wife doesn't normally touch coleslaw or potato salad and she loved them both. Plenty of bite to both of them.< /Text>

This place has good food (innovative plates), nice drinks and great service. It is a bit pricey and can get extremely loud inside, especially if you're sharing the table with noisy strangers! Outside seating is more pleasant and more conducive to conversations so pick that if you have a choice.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1604773552155, 'text': 'Thank you for your review Melanie!'}< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Love it!  Been going there since our shop moved nearby.  The burgers are great and H U G E and other good food and shareable eats.  Good plentiful drinks and pleasant neighborly crowd. Place practically clears about 7pm when commuters head for home.  Sorry it's closed on weekends.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Man this place is way beyond what you'd expect from a "pizza joint". No offense to any other pizza spots, I love a good pie myself. But, they've got a lot more to choose from, and what they've got, is GOOD. Grill Em has got some great food at great prices. It's never too crowded and, to top it all off, Johnny and Christina behind the bar set the place on fire! Bomb.com<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><UserId.>114569158276044119946</UserId.>< GmapID>

Don't be fooled, this warehouse looking exterior in an industrial park houses a gem!  Stopped in on our way to Santa Cruz to catch the Warrior game and wait out the traffic. The place as packed, but a two nice young men gave our family of 4 their table.  Orders are placed at the bar. The guy was slammed but he was still friendly and helpful. He encouraged me to get the happy hour special pizza because it was a better value. He was working hard to serve everyone.   He even delivered our drinks and showed us where the soda machine was so we could get free refills.
The food was really good. We enjoyed the pizza, mac n' cheese, chicken quesadilla and a steak sandwich. Everything was tasty and hot.  For as busy as they were this was remarkable.
The game was great, the atmosphere was fun and we will surely visit again if we are back this way.< /Text>

<text>If you’re looking for something spicy, skip this place. I ordered chicken tenders tossed in buffalo sauce, and on the first bite, I was completely disgusted. The chicken was clearly just frozen chicken tenders that probably were not very fresh and the buffalo sauce was sweet until it just burned the back of my throat. 0 out of 10, would not recommend.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fcbfe178eed81:0x8e215c8b9fddf2a4<//gmapID></record>

Great hidden gem in the middle of an industrial area   great place for burgers, pizza, sandwiches, appetizers, and beer. Had the bison burger and it was huge. Looks like a great place for happy hour. Will be back for sure<//Review>

<Review>Christina is an amazing  bartender. Granted I'm biased cause I've known her for like ever, but a good bartender is a good bartender PeriodT. I brought my friend Guy here for his bday cause he never likes to celebrate his bday and boy did he have a blast. Thanks Chris you made his day.</Review>< pics>

Great happy hour spot with surprisingly good food. The Mac n Cheese is THE BOMB. I love that I can customize it to my liking! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the beer selection could use some improvement, especially for craft beer drinkers.< /Text>

This place is so awesome the food is always great. An open bar and it is crowded most of the time but it's worth it.  The salids are  always fresh and the blue cheese dressing is the bomb.  Everything is good here and a lot of TVs very cool.

Garlic fries are, well how do I explain it.

you don't have to wait once a year to go to Gilroy just come here everyday</review>

Happy hour prices are good. Generous time frame for happy hour 2pm-9pm mon-fri. The appetizers are rather average, mac and cheese is pretty cheesy but at the same time is runny. If you plan to drink than this place is the place to be during happy hour< /Review>

<Review>In San Jose for a football game and looked up sports bar on Google maps, finding the Grill Em Pizza & Sports Bar.  Located off the beaten path and the outside looked questionsble.  However the atmosphere is great! Lots of tv's, great music, great food, great people and great price.  If ever back in San Jose would make a point to come here!<//Review>< name>

< Review>
I ordered the Cindy special Steak sandwich... AFrikin mazing... The chef actually knows what medium rare is.  The food is always good, but that was off the hook. Thanks for the recommendation Cindy!< /Review>

Weird location for a bar/restaurant. Standard selection of food and beer. Onion "strings" were more like chunks, battered and deep-fried. I was expecting a thinner version of onion rings, would not recommend.<//Review>

Amazing customer service. Great manager. Attention to details. They text you when your car is ready. So happy with the results always. They detailed my interior and shampooed the car carpets. The car looks brand new with the amazing puffing on the outside</text>< pics>

I took the car to get the seats shampooed and the staff was friendly, it took about an hour and I was okay. But once I got home there was dirt stains everywhere, like the only did the center of the seats and all the head rests were still dirty. My car's interior is grey and it is noticeable. I'm more concerned about the dirt stains because I know I'm like a toddler when it comes to spilling coffee and food. For me, that's understandable that those stains were going to be a little visible but dirt stains from dust and common usage. I'm beyond disappointed that I spent $70 dlls just to get it vacuum and a half job on shampoo. I came home and I did more with a brush and a turtle wax upholstery that I got from the 99 cent store.< /review>

<Review>The night before heading over I was designated DD and ended up with vomit all over my back seats. Needless to say, I needed my car interior detailed. I headed over to Midway Express and was immediately greeted and asked which service I'd need. Showed them my back seats and they quoted me and let me know of what the service entailed. I paid and they took my name and number down as I was told this would take a while (understandable). I waited in their shady seat section while my car was cleaned up. It was spotless and like new! Super friendly staff, quick quality work. I am definitely coming back to get my services done here from now on.<//Review>< UserId.>

Fast, clean and  organized! Brought my car to be washed and almost had a stroke! Prices are very high to me 😠,( see photos). Car washes like this are becoming hard to find every thing is going to a cheaper style car wash where you vacuum yourself, however with those the personal extra touch is missing and  there is no detail options.
Watching them service cars made me miss the convenience of hand wash car washes. Busy spot catered to more of the elderly crowd.< /Text>

They are very nice, which is why we can come here many times, but the gentleman cleaning the inside of my car wasn't properly wearing his mask, so I will not be returning.</review>

Got my car detailed and it came back soaking wet and covered in oil on the inside. It reeked from across the block. There was condensation from all the oils on the inside of all the windows for weeks and when it dried it left a residue on the inside of all the windows! Would not recommend.</text>

<Text>I wish I'd taken before pictures. My car is perpetually infested with sand and dog hair.  3+ months ago I popped in for a quick car wash.  I needed a thorough detail but didnt have time.  Lee gave me a free deluxe wash that day and a deal on a future detailing.

Today I went in for the detail and my car is now immaculate.  I have only ever had one detail job this good (for twice the price) in Arizona 5-6 years ago.  I've  even had detailing done for nearly twice the price that wasn't nearly as thorough.

Lee and team take pride in their work!  Friendly.  Not pushy.  I couldn't be happier with the quality of their work!  I will definitely go back.</Text>< response>

I decided to give this place a chance even after reading the reviews. I took two cars to get cleaned and will have to do work on them now. Windows, carpet, doors and wheels all need work. Detailing job could use a little more attention to detail. Overall "okay" work, not the worse...<//Text>

Everything was pretty close to what you'd expect from your average car wash.
Service is swift - from start to finish under 10 minutes.
Location is very convenient - right off of Midway and  next to all the stores in the strip mall there.
All went well until I was called to receive the car back and immediately noticed the dirt smudges on the driver's side door. I had to ask for a cloth and handle it myself. Took me all of 45 seconds to clean it perfectly and at  $13 for 10 minutes I think it should have been handled by the staff.</Review>

Don’t make the same mistake as me. Avoid this place at all costs.

Paid for the premium detailing and both the inside and outside of my brand new $40k truck are ruined.

These guys are amateurs.< /text>

<text>Great family owned business that treats people with respect. Prices are fair, but they consistently go the extra mile to assure your satisfied. Even the employees he has drying/detailing the cars have been there for years. It’s a warm place that makes you feel good for supporting them.

Four days ago, I took my car to this place and a gentleman named Lee, gave me a great deal for cleaning my car inside and out. He was a very kind and patient with me even though I was picky when it comes to cleaning my car. I appreciate your business ;)<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Had an exterior detail a few weeks ago on my 2015 black Mazda CX5 and paid a little extra for them to clean the top of the interior by the sunroof and windows because a lot of dirt and dust had been building up. I got the car back only 2 hours later and was extremely surprised to see that they did even more than expected and in such little time.
Not only did they dominate the exterior detail, but I sat down in the driver’s seat to take a look and the entire interior was crystal clean like a brand new car.
Besides that, the customer service was insanely great, welcoming, and friendly.... so I naturally tipped them above average. I’ll never use a different car wash.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80deaafbbf7604df:0xa5d867c98d331ee2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've been taking my car to the carwash for the past 20 years and have always been completely satisfied! The owner is super friendly and always calls me sir or boss. The employees always are friendly and do a very good job. They also offer and waxes and boat detailing at competitive prices! And they recycle their water. What more could you ask for in a car wash?< /Review>

That is the only thing I use their and I love it. And since I only go once a month I can splurge on the most expensive car wash which really isn't that expensive considering how great my car and my tires look when it's done.  They have someone to pre wash your car before it goes in and someone to dry it off at the end.

<text>Wish I had read the reviews first before taking my vehicle to this place for a full detail for $175.

Recommendation - DO NOT do this!

The windshield was dirty when I picked the vehicle up which was a clue as to how well they had actually detailed it - not very well.

Now that I can actually see it the next day in the sun it's still dirty in places where it wasn't even washed properly let alone polished.

Very poor quality job and I will not use this crew again and that's a shame as I could have brought them significant business but not after this experience.

Go somewhere else - you'll get a better job done.<//text>< Pics>

When they finally completed their work, all of the seats were soaking wet, the floor mats were upside down and they had taken the 2 water bottles. As I'm driving away I discovered that they factory reset my radio (I know it wasn't a disconnected battery because I get an alert on my phone for that). After making it home I also discovered they also took my windshield shade. Will not be returning.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Paid 150 for a detail outside and in. I asked for a hand wash and they put the car through the machine. When i was called because they had completed the car still had dirt on the mud flaps, windows still very spotty, my seat still with the same spot I had asked them to remove. I had to ask the guy to go over some parts and "DETAIL" the dirt and spots in the car... he seemed annoyed by me asking him to re-do it.. if you're looking for a quick wash, then go here. If you want a detail then go to Palms car wash or k street and Broadway in chula vista they are affordable and they do such a great job on the deatiling (which is what you are paying for)<//Text>

This place has always been great but the last couple of times it's like they half assed it. Today I went in my boyfriends car and again paid for the supreme car wash and cleaning and the steering wheel was still dirty and there was still dirt around the car mats they vacuumed and smudges on the dash. I went in and asked that they take a look and within seconds they had it back in and did a great job. That made me super happy. I just hate that I may have to ask for a do over when I bring my car in this week.<//Text>

<Review>This company committed credit fraud against me. They charged me 60 dollars for a 12 dollar car wash. I never write reviews but I am writing this so others don't have this happen to them. Car wash was good, but doesn't matter if the company is dishonest and steeling peoples money. I saw the receipt, which said 12, so it wasn't a manual error.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80deaafbbf7604df:0xa5d867c98d331ee2< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Took my sister's car in, it was nasty-- sand all over the interior and gritty exterior. They did a fine job washing the windows and body. They could have been more meticulous with getting all the sand off (there was still some sand, but they vacuumed the majority of it off). Considering how bad the car was when I took it in I think they did a decent job. If you want your interior super clean, though, I would go for the higher priced options (I did $12 wash). Wait time was 15-20 mins as the cashier lady said.<//text></record>

<pics>None</pics><text>The outside of my car was pretty dirty, but not hard to get off it was dust that had been blown onto the car from construction. The inside looked like it had barely been vacuumed at all. I got the full service wash which includes the outside, inside windows, outside windows and carpet vacuuming. If they are going to offer these, I expect that it is actually done and done fully. You can't just partially vaccuum something and call it done.</text><date>1400730735174</date><gmap_id>0x80deaafbbf7604df:0xa5d867c98d331ee2< /gmap_id><response>None< /response></record>

Horrible service I payed for a super wash and instead I felt that I payed for a super fast half way done. When I got home I had to re-vacuum my self. People don't waste your time and money, you can get the same service from a 5 dollar car wash.< /Review>

Paid for a Super Wash...all they did was vacuum it, run it through the wash and dry it off. Also, when they "vacumed" they used an air hose to blow the dirt and dust out of the crevices which ended up on the seats. They didnt even bother wiping off the crap from bothe the driver side and passenger side seats. Lastly, where is my air freshener, what happened to detailing the wheels and why didn't they do the exterior amourall like they were supposed to?!? Don't go here expecting attention to detail! You won't get it unless you pay for the VIP treatment and huge tips. Wasted money.</Review>

Horrible service. Literally my car looked the same. When guy told me it was done he rolled down my windows and i had to wipe them down again. Specifically took my car to get vaccumed and he vaccumed for like 30 seconds<//Text>

I have had take away food experience and can say their spice level is - mild to sweet. I feel they add extra potatoes in their curries as fillers which tend to add to sweetness. I personally prefer curries with more vegetable content and less of fillers (like potatoes).
They use styrofoam take away containers which is worst for environment, hope they upgrade to better alternative.<//review><userid>109857802419997450689</userid><Date>1615358510970<//Date>< rate>

Good Punjabi India food. There samosa and tikki chat is best in this area. I haven eaten at almost all the places in Artesia but no match to their chat. They make fresh Curry's almost every day and they have combos. On special occasions they put an table in the middle with sweets and other stuff. It's very convenient for us rather than going to Artesia. They also have Indian grocery and other stuff.<//Text>

Cheap and authentic north Indian food.  If you are out on vacation for some time. missing home made chapatis and dal, and tired of eating heavy restaurant food, then this is just the right place for lunch. We went there last summer from Houston with my brother's family from Canada. They were very friendly and courteous. The place is small but the food is A grade. Homely, healthy and authentic Indian food. Will go there again. Thanks!</text>

<text>I used to live in La Palma, CA and used to visited this place a couple of times. Although the store is a bit cramped in space, it does serve good north Indian food. Apart from selling groceries that are fresh, they also sell Indian soft drinks. The meal comes with a free soft drink. I recollect missing dinners from this store in the night since they close right around 9 PM (or so).</text><user_name>Aswinikumar Annadatha Venkata< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had such a good experience at Rocky Ridge family dental.
I was seen immediately and was explained in detail everything that was being discussed.
Then when my appointment was over the nicest lady helped explain my insurance discounts and price options for treatment.
This is my first time going to the dentist on my own health insurance and I walked out of there very happy and confident (normally I leave the dentist in tears)!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I thoroughly enjoyed my dental appointment. From the start of my journey being humanly directed by their receptionist to their slightly out of the way office to my X-rays taken by Ina and exam by Dr. Cruz. The office staff is delightful, helpful and very knowledgeable about all facets of dentistry and dental insurance. I almost cancelled because the office was assigned to me through my dental insurance carrier and I wanted the opportunity to choose my own.  I am so happy I didn’t.  They are a wonderful team and I am now an official patient!</Review>

Rocky Ridge Dental is a fantastic group of people. Everyone was very professional and very caring during my whole experience. They fit me in on the last day of my insurance to take care of a broken tooth that needed a crown. It took a while but they had to make the crown, and Dr Cruz was really great and made sure I was comfortable with no pain the whole time. Everything was really clean too. I really recommend them.< /Text>

<Text>Thank you Dr. Behniwal and Allie for taking care of my crowns. Going to the dentist is my least favorite thing in the world but the team here made my experience pleasant and comfortable. They are friendly and professional. I’m amazed that they are able to make the crowns onsite! This saved me so much time. No going back and forth to the dental office with a temporary crown. I highly recommend this dental practice.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x809b1ff0669e3bb9:0x8155aa4aab108b19< /Gmap_id>< date>

<review>I've never had a bad experience here. Dr. Cruz is amazing and always makes sure I'm comfortable whenever I've needed any major work done. The front office workers always makes me feel welcome. The dental hygienists (shoutout Michelle [think that's her name]) are extremely thorough and makes getting your teeth cleaned a painless experience. I genuinely love this place. If you have any doubts whatsoever about where to go for your dental needs, no need to look elsewhere. 10/10<//review>< date>

The entire staff here is so awesome. They are accommodating, kind, efficient, and comfortable! My family and I just made a switch after having the same office for 10+ years and I wish we switched sooner! If you’re looking look no further. I just got an inlay done and I got to watch Allie create it right there (technology is so insane). I also like how they all work together - it’s just a good vibe! Thank goodness for you all! My kids, husband and I all recommend them!</Review>

<Review>I had a awesome experience at Rocky Ridge Family Dental. I personally have had so much anxiety when it comes to going to the dentist but Dr. B’s team instantly made me feel comfortable. Because I hadn’t been to a dentist in a long time I needed quite a bit of work. They were able to break it down an create a manageable treatment plan so things weren’t as daunting. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful. Natalie was amazing with the x-rays and ensuring I was conformable. Dr. B explained everything every step of the way and is very good at what she does. Allie was absolutely amazing! She was very personable and kind. Their entire staff holds themselves to high standards and they truly deliver! I would definitely recommend them!</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Amazing experience! I was a new patient looking to get established and with stroke of luck I chose the right one. Everyone is very comforting, accommodating, efficient and professional.

Dr. Behniwal is very calm and assuring,  thoroughly explained the treatment plan and did a fabulous job. Natalie did a good job with X-rays and preparing me for the consult and being a talker myself I was at ease, Allie being aesthetically inclined did a excellent work with the fillings and I am pretty happy with results.
Last but not the least Sherry is incredibly helpful and   came up with best insurance plan to cover all the expenses.< /review>< pictures>

No way they should have five stars. They are a scam and have been scamming people for years. Go with your gut feeling.
When they charge you as a patient and lie to you and your insurance company about the codes they use. Check with your insurance and do the homework. They want $800 for work and I went to another dentist for the same work and it coast me $115. It's really sad they get away with it.< /Review>

Sherri at the front desk was so welcoming and was kind enough to explain my insurance coverage to me for this appointment. I didn't feel pressured to opt for any treatments with extra costs. Natalie is newer to this office and she ensured I was comfortable for my X-rays and let me know I could take a break at any time if I needed. Dr. B and Allie were both great as well! They polished and cleaned my teeth quickly and throughly. Had wonderful conversation with everyone I met and am looking forward to my next visit!

<Review>I am a new patient in this office and I must say the staff is very friendly and professional. The office is very clean, which is important given these Covid times.

Doctor Cruz explained everything in detail and was very patient with me while doing the exam. I felt comfortable asking him questions regarding my dental health and by the end of appointment I had a solid plan of how to improve it!

I’d highly recommend this office!< /Review>< Date>

WOW. I would give more stars if possible.I can’t believe how incredible everyone has been. The front desk was kind and extremely informative. Doctor Cruz had kind, yet professional bedside manner and Michelle, (DH) did an amazing job deep cleaning my teeth. I can’t wait for my teeth journey to begin at Rocky Ridge Family Dental. #happysmiles</review>

< review>
Dr. Cruz, Ina, Lily and the entire Rocky Ridge Family Dental Team were the most outstanding group I've had the pleasure of going to. This is the place to get rid of any dental anxiety! I came in with highly sensitive teeth (from another local practice who whitened and ground down my teeth without educating me on the residual effects), needing a bunch of fillings, a crown replacement, root planing, a cleaning, and referrals for 2 wisdom teeth and 2 implants.
Dr. Cruz was the most communicative, empathetic and educational doctor I've ever had. I swear he has a 6th (maybe 7th) sense when working on his patients' teeth because I never had a problem communicating to him while he fixed all of the above for me over the past year or so. He and team work together seamlessly and were so fun to be around, too. There was never an uncomfortable moment - my first visit was even while they were training a new assistant and Lily's care and positive instruction made me wish I worked with her, too (LOL). The front desk staff worked directly with me on billing and payments and always went over and ABOVE working with my ridiculous insurance company to make sure everything was covered that should be. Even with everything during this COVID-19 mess, the entire office took every safety measure imaginable to ensure the same service standards went unchanged. I have zero plans of ever going anywhere else - even just for advice now!< /review>

<Review>Had a great experience with rocky ridge dental today! Ali did an amazing job with my filling and crown. Go see Ali she’s there the first 3 Friday’s of every month. If not you can find her in Lincoln. She made me comfortable and that’s rare when going to the dentist for me.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Wonderful staff! Everyone makes you feel very welcome and comfortable. The facility is very clean and follows all of the current guidelines immaculately! Dr. Behniwal is very comforting and doesn’t make you have unnecessary work done. Everyone is very accommodating and understanding. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to going to the dentist, but I felt very comfortable here. Allie is such a fun person to talk to and makes you feel “at home”. No complaints!!!< /review>

Dr. Cruz and his assistant Lilian are simply wonderful. They care about their patients and are both very gentle! I've had quite a bit of dental work done here and everything has gone exceptionally well.

They also offer Zoom whitening in addition to general dentistry. The Zoom process was quick, painless, and the results were fantastic!

I highly recommend Rocky Ridge Family Dental for anyone wanting a kind, gentle, and patient centered dental office that does amazing work!< /review>

I was told to give a review over and over in the office so here it goes.  Save your time and money do not go here.  They seem like they are more interested in maxing out your benefits and getting as much money as possible than they are about your dental work.  Then for them to continually ask you to give a review..I had been there all of 20 minutes did X-rays and spoke with the dentist what am I suppose to review ???? Then they pass you a card here give this to your friends so they can save $50 and maybe you can win $100 off your dental work..F this place.  I will never go back.  My wife went the same day as me and felt exactly as I did.  They are car salesman not a dentist office .</Text>

Dr. Cruz has been my dentist for the last few years and him and his staff are the BEST! I have irrational fear of pain and he’s been amazing in the regard and his work is second to none. Lillian and his staff are so caring and always nice to me, highly recommend if you need a dentist for life<//Review>

I hope no one ignores my review.

Essentially, the reviews where they are more interested in the money and revenue than patient care is 100% accurate.  I can't say that they provide treatment plans that are not needed as other reviews mentioned, but I can say that they are more interested in the $ than patient care. So, I went in because one of my crowns randomly cracked on the bottom of one of my front teeth. I go in to get it fixed. After an X Ray the dentist comes in "I am going to have to do a whole new crown but I want to use (insert top of the line material) which is going to cost a bit more but will last longer than this one did". I agree that is fine, but I want to examine the cost. Then comes Sherry, she comes in and laughs and says "When you see me you know it means more money haha". Then tells me my insurance does not cover the cost of the crown but will cover the build up but it will cost me $1200 out of pocket. I thought that was a little high so I decided to call my insurance company myself. I explained what happened and they told me I would be responsible for my copay of $50 and up to $325 if I wanted the best material used. They then call Rocky Ridge (felicia) and Felicia says she will fill out the pre auth form with Delta Dental but it will take 72 hours. So, I wait 72 hours to get the update, and Sherry tells me "we never do pre authorization with HMO plans, as the fee schedule is illustrated in the plan". I agree with her then show her the plan where it shows my co pay options along with footnotes than clearly says

"The replacement of an existing inlay, onlay, crown, fixed partial denture (bridge)
or a removable full or partial denture is covered when:
a. The existing restoration/bridge/denture is no longer functional and cannot be
made functional by repair or adjustment, and
b. Either of the following:
- The existing non-functional restoration/bridge/denture was placed three or
more years prior to its replacement"

My initial crown was over 4 years ago. So I call Delta Dental to make sure I am interpreting this correctly, and of course I am. So Sherry says she will call Corporate on 9/18 and get back to me on 9/21. I don't hear back so I call today 9/22 and finally get an email saying Corporate wants me to pay out of pocket but I can file a grievance later with insurance to get my money back. I am not going through this. There whole thing is that "your coverage only covers decay" That is clearly wrong as I asked my insurance company what they cover and they do cover for causes of decay but they also cover restoration replacements over 3 years old and that is what my deal is. Also the initial crown is from when I took a bat to the mouth 4 years ago and they covered everything even though that was "cosmetic", same insurance company, same policy, different dentist. BEWARE WHEN LOOKING FOR A DENTIST!!!

Sherry mentioned multiple times" we can't charge you $350 because it cost us more in material". I don't know what to tell you, because that is what Delta Dental is telling me and they are the insurance company, bill them.  I get it, as a small business owner, all businesses need to make a profit but I don't like to be lied to and feel deceived when going to a medical office. I shouldn't have the same feeling of a used car salesman with my dentist.</Review><name>Jon Gay< /name>< response>

<Review>I’ve always been so scared to go to the dentist but Dr. Cruz has changed that for me. He is so caring and gentle. I’ve never felt any pain when he puts the needle in my gum nor have I felt any pain during the process of doing a crown or filling. His assistant Lilian is the best! She does such a great job I never feel like I’m drowning. She has a wonderful personality and makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. I highly recommend them. I’m no longer scared of the dentist!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

They are reasonably priced for those of us who don’t have the greatest insurance. Dr. Cruz is fabulous. He explains things are he goes and he is very gentle. Jen is my hygienist and she is very thorough but gentle as well. I would highly recommend this practice for any family that cares about their oral health and wants a good experience.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809b1ff0669e3bb9:0x8155aa4aab108b19</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Thank you Dr. Cruz, Inna, and all your team for such a personal experience and great attention to all my individial needs.

This is the BEST office! Staff very professional and friendly.
Sherry was amazing when it came to working with the insurance and getting the best plan to cover all my needs.

I had done fillings, crowns, implants and cleaning.  I couldn’t be more happier))!!
If your looking for a great dentist,Dr. Cruz is the best dentist and his team is excellent.

<Text>As a new patient, it was a nice experience with Rocky Ridge Dental. Staff were friendly and highly accommodating. There were no intimidation per se.

I have been going to Rocky Ridge Family Dental for about 5 years. I have anxiety when it come to dental procedures and every staff person, assistant, dentist, and hygienist is always so wonderful and talk me through my anxiety and make sure I am comfortable. The front desk staff is so nice and explains services very clearly. The dentist is so kind and somehow every time I have to have fillings I feel ZERO pain even when he administers the numbing shot! My hygienist is so kind as well! I always recommend this office when I hear someone is looking for a new dentist!!<//review>

<Review>This is a very professional place.  The staff have a lot of personality and there is someone to answer all of you questions always.  They have a good division of labor at the desk and in the office.  Each has their own expertise while also being opened to help with all the many tasks of the office.  I was impressed my first visit at how organized they were.  Dr. Cruz is a very amicable and trustworthy dentist.  He does good work and he was able to fix the mess a previous dentist had left me with!  I’m so grateful to have good dental care I can trust.

Don’t miss the chance to get a bonus by getting a referral to his office from another patient!  You both get money off your next appointment!  They also have other promotions they do.  I think that there are cheaper dentists, but you get what you pay for here.  This certainly isn’t the most expensive, and of course everyone has their own medical plan and their own idea of what expenses should be.  This place does the work right and you can depend on them.  That’s the bottomline for me with any medical care:  Trust.</Review>< gmapID>

The women at the front desk are phenomenal and so helpful and kind! Last time I had fillings was a horrible experience and I felt pain the entire time. Yesterday, however, I got my fillings done at Rocky Ridge Family Dental and Dr. Cruz was amazing! It was 100% pain free and so quick! I haven’t had a great experience like that with a dental office is so long. Very appreciative for all of them at Rocky Ridge Family Dental :)</Review>

Alex, Dr. Cruz and the assistants all project a friendly, professional, welcoming attitude.  I generally have my appointments early, sometimes at 8 AM and everyone seems ready to perform their work cheerfully.
I think they are all appropriately educated and experienced and I feel very confident in their work.  The administrators in the reception area also do a great job.<//review>

I highly recommend Rocky Ridge family dental.  My adult daughter has a phobia about shots and Dr. Cruz was so patient with her as well as his assistant Lilian whose sweet demeanor completely calmed her anxiety. Dr. Cruz gives a pain free shot so now when she goes she has no more anxiety about it ! Truly a miracle! The entire staff is very friendly.</Review>

<review>Get a second opinion before spending hundreds of dollars here. I took my whole family here and they said we each had a bunch of cavities. We got a referral to a pediatric dentist for our daughters and turns out one of them only has one cavity and the other only has 2.

I just received something from my insurance about how much this new dentist would charge me to fill my daughter's cavities and I own nothing. Kind of strange how both places took my insurance but this place wanted to charge me $100/cavity and the new place isn't charging me anything and my insurance covers the whole thing!</review><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>I've been going to Rocky Ridge Family Dental for quite a few years now. Dr. Cruz and her staff have always given me the best dental care.  The front office staff, Danica in particular , have always been very friendly and helpful. She always remembers little personal things about each client and asks how you are doing at each visit and she's truly interested. Jessica is awesome when it comes to my treatment and costs and explaining my treatment to me.  I would definitely recommend this office for dental care.</review>< GmapID>

Dr Cruz and his staff are amazing!

I have a very serious phobia around the dentist, due to past experiences. Because of this, I have not taken care of my teeth the way I should have. My wife has been a long-standing patient of Dr Cruz and begged me to give them a try. Although I kicked and screamed for weeks before, the entire time I was on my way there, I am happy to report (and so are my teeth) that I have been back on numerous occasions having issues taken care of one by one without even a whimper. He and his staff are so very patient and always ask no matter what you are getting done if you are ok and need a break. Oh, and Dr Cruz is fantastic at the numbing process.

One other huge benefit is they make their crowns in-house and are usually ready while you wait!</text>

I can’t say enough of how much of a great doctor dr. Cruz is . This review is long overdue. I’ve had several work done with him and his work is exceptional. I move to Fairfield and I drive 1 hour just to see him. He is very kind and is always making sure you are doing okay. His assistant Lilian and Inna are amazing so fun to talk to and they treat you like family. The dental hygienist has a really cool demeanor and does a great job also. So don’t look else where if you need any work done don’t hesitate to come to Rocky Ridge Family Dental  if you want nice healthy 🦷🦷🦷🦷Thank me later 🤗!<//Review>

Went in to be fitted for a crown today and wow, can't believe how fast and painless it was. Dr. Cruz is so gentle on your mouth. Got my temporary crown on and next morning the office called and said my permanent crown was ready to be put on. Wow that was fast. They now do all crowns in house.
Later that day got my permanent Crown put on. I must say this is the BEST CROWN EVER!!! Thanks sooooo much.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Took on a piece of beef jerky and my front tooth with a crown and lost. Snapped my tooth at the root. Dr. Cruz and his office took me in right away. Novocaine experiment was the best ever. Lilian was  also incredible. She's  an artist on temporary bridges.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>What me and my husband have found to be true about this place is that they recommend work that doesnt need to be done. We alone have spent close to 4000 out of our pockets and god only knows what they bill our insurance. For a missed appointment they charge 55.00 and pursue it even if I feel it's justified (my husband works as paramedic/firefighter/engineer and was held over on his job. They still billed the 55 dollars even though my husband cant just walk off the job. When you question the staff they argue.
Like I told my husband someone has to pay for the dentist new Mercedes. I will not go back. I am finding a new dentist. Let's not forget I gave them a referral too.< /review>< Pictures>

I have been to so many dental offices throughout the country and the professionalism at Rocky Ridge Dental is one of the best! Ask for Alex as your hygienist. He is thorough, helpful with questions, and really does an excellent job.</text>

I moved to the Roseville areas 6 years ago.  I finally found Rocky Ridge Dental and Dr Cruz... he is very gentle, in a beautiful and peaceful office setting.  And his assistant Lilian, she explained very clearly all the options the Doctor recommended.  I'm happy I found a practice, that eases all my fears!

2018 update: Years later, I still visit Rocky Ridge Dental.  And now, several of my family members go to their office as well.  I highly recommend this dental office!< /Text>

Don't base your opinion of this office on old reviews. Dr. Cruz is arguably the best, most caring dentist my wife and I have ever had. The staff is also top notch. They work with us on payment options if necessary. My wife just had a year old crown fail and they replaced free, no questions asked.< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><time>1552660908595<//time><review>While I’ve only been here for my first visit, I’m very pleased. My last dentis clearly needed new everything for her boat, so this was a refreshing experience. The staff were all great, friendly, professional. The office was clean and comfortable. I hate paperwork and digging through insurance red tape, but that was very clearly explained to me by Sharron what was covered and what wasn’t. And although this may turn some people off, I love that Dr Cruz doesn’t even try to keep any of the financial stuff in his head. This allows him to be very honest about what my mouth needed, and then Sharron (poor thing!) gets to go over al the $$$ with me so I can prioritize based off my personal situation any my individual insurance plan. I look forward to going back and getting my wife started here as a patient as well.</review>< gmapID>

Inna, Dr Cruz, Lilyain are great. The front office staff however have driven me out of this office. I have never encountered such a poor unethical attitude from office staff (Sabrina). Causing Dr Cruz to loose out on thousands of dollars in services.<//review>

I don't understand the reasoning behind all of these negative reviews. They were probably written by people looking for a free hand-out.
I have always found this office very honest and very affordable. I have been a patient of Rocky Ridge Dental for years and I have never left unhappy. The entire staff has always taken care of my needs when it comes to my teeth.  I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking for an honest dental office that sincerely cares about their patients.< /text>

These people are terrible to work with. Hidden fees.   When you call for info it's impossible to get answers  I have to go back consistently for them to try and get my mouth feeling better and it doesn't.    I wouldn't recommend wasting your time going here< /review>

The Office Staff is new and needs to be trained.  They do not know how to deal with Insurance.  Made me pay in advance for my cleaning and then after a month and several phone calls from me they say they will reimburse me for the insurance portion of the payment. I cancelled any further service with Rocky Ridge Family Dental.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  Further problems, they obtained the wrong information from my Insurance company regarding dental work that was needed.</Text>

We definitely are proud to have serve you with all your dental care needs here at Rocky Ridge Family Dental.

My prices were given to me in writing before any work was completed.  I was charged the exact amount.  They were very clear about the options and costs.  They were very thorough and performed the consultation at no cost. They offerred me treatment plan options in case I couldn't afford all the work. The explained my dental work in depth and gave me plenty of time to make a decision on what treatment plan I wanted to follow.  I even took time to call relatives and get advice but the prices and recommendations were all right on for normal dental care.There was no cost for extra xrays.  They were very careful and I didnt experience any pain or discomfort.  I have already referred friends and family and they have all been happy with this office.  The office staff has been courteous and helpful.<//review>< pictures>

Just like others im scared going to d dentist,
But when i met my wife's dentist. Dr cruz of rocky ridge family dental and tried his pain free shot.

All d staff were so friendly and always smiling..
Dr.cruz and his assistant lilian were a perfect duo..and they understand my anxiety with any
Dental procedures..
Finally  i found a dental office that im comfortable to go to and do my dental works!!!<//text>

DO NOT GO TO ROCKY RIDGE FAMILY  DENTAL!!! They are rude and unprofessional. They quoted me one price for a tooth extraction and tried to charge me over $100 higher once it was pulled. When I called to reschedule an appointment, they sighed heavily into the phone, like I was asking for something extraordinary. Terrible group of people.</review>

THE WORSE DENTIST EVER!!!! DO NOT COME HERE!. This place doesn't deserve one star. Amandeep Behniwal is unprofessional. I got a crown done from her, paid 1845, and got a botched procedure. I have told her I am not happy with the work and she refuses to fix what she has done.  People have noticed the botched procedure and I am so embarrassed! I hate my smile!! All she is after is the money in your pocket. According to Behniwal- pay up, get a botched procedure, then you are on your own. She will not listen or consider your complaint or concerns. Literally teared up in front of her because I hated my smile and she did not care and said "sorry there is nothing I can do". So that same day, I went to a better dentist who noticed the botched work and simply said "I can fix this". So far, I love my new dentist!! The other dentists may be great at rocky ridge but do not see this Behniwal. Matter of fact, do not go to ROCKY RIDGE!. Behniwal does not care. To end this matter, I will be getting my refund from her and go from there and never look back. I NEED MY REFUND!!< /Review>

Worst experiance with this office every time i visit and most recently called to get an appointment because a filling they did fell out now i have a tooth ache I was told they only had an appointment more then a week away when I refused the receptionist said she'd talk to the dentist and call me back . . . That was 3 days ago I haven't heard from them since needless to say I won't be back!<//Text>

<review>Very nice place to bring your kids to the playground. This playground is pretty new and is always clean. There is no sand so that's a plus and there are alot of different stations on the playground with a different activity and fact about the great outdoors and the animals that live there. I've been bring my youngest kids for years here and I hope to bring my grandchildren to this park. Alot of good memories.<//review>< pics>

Went to the tennis courts by the outdoor basketball courts. Only reason it's 4 stars is because there are no benches. Usually empty so it's a great alternative to el cariso park.</Review>

The recreation center is amazing! There are many sports and classes that are offered on a year-round basis. Besides the small homeless problem, the facility is clean and managed very well. The office staff is friendly and very helpful when it comes to answering questions.</review>

It's is a great place for family and friends to go have a tremendous amount of fun. There are also some playsets for children under the age of 3. From the experience I have had there the employees in the office are very friendly and willing to help you with any problem or assistance you need help with.</Text>

I'm very disappointment with how much resistance I'm getting from the staff for having my daughter in coed soccer. For starters I don't think girls and boys should be separated for shots when they're only 6. Honestly my daughter did better then half the other kids at try outs. The disappointing part is that when I signed her up they suggested the all girls league. I declined and paid 75 because I understand the importance of being in coed sports. Then at try outs they asked again if I wanted to switch her. Just last night someone called me from the recreation center telling me I only paid 10 so she has to be in the girls league. I told him I paid 75 and she's staying where she's at. I don't understand how I'm getting so much resistance, at this point it's getting close to harassing because the recreation center employees are beyond sexiest. They're children let them play whatever their parents paid to put them in and leave the parents alone.</Text>

<text>I was hoping with having a new director in place the park would be a little more organized with its activities. That has not been the case, I am extremely sadden by this... I have a busy life you should have a game schedule at least 2 weeks in advance  or at minimum 1 week.Giving them notice on a Wednesday that they have a game on Saturday is a horrible way to run things. Please get your act together SYLMAR RECREATIONS we rely on these activities to keep our kids involved in their own communities, however I now understand why parent go outside of our communities for these sorts of activities when things are ran the way this  park has bee ran for the last 2 seasons of basketball.<//text>< Response>

<date>1541337193930</date><rate>2< /rate><Review>It has a nice play ground for the kids. It is in between a jr high and high school and if you go during the week it becomes a hang out place for the jr high and high school kids after school. Fights break out and sometimes the older kids go hiding behind the trees to smoke weed. Once I could not use the bathroom because there was a man and woman taking a " shower " with the bathroom sink water. Definitely not a place to let your kids play while you read a book. Both eyes on them always.<//Review>< pictures>

Probably one of the bad parks I have visited. Wish it was bigger,they have space. They also updated it,I would prefer the old version of the park though,more swings,better bridges and such,stuff like that.</text>

< Review>
I had a tire repaired here, and also priced a new set of tires, which I will do some day soon. Excellent customer service. Fast, as the name would imply. Very reasonable pricing.  I definitely recommend this place for all your tire needs!< /Review>

<review>I originally stopped at the only other local tire place that was open on a Saturday to get a tire patched, and was told that, because I had already put a temp plug in it myself that they couldn’t touch it. It was recommended that I try Fast Tire. Let me tell you, they not only did it in record time (I was there for no more than 10 minutes), it turned out to be less expensive than I had anticipated. I’ll definitely be going back!!</review><Time>1569180656656< /Time>< gmapID>

I had a flat tire and these thief's sold ma a used tire for $180.00. My only options was to buy it because no one had it. They quoted  me $50.00. Be very careful with them. I reported them to the Local police. They will take advantage of you.< /review>

Fast Tire is exactly that. Fast. In and out in 15-20 minutes, unless they're super busy and everyone ahead of you is getting full tire changes, and extra things. Even then, they still have you taken care of as quickly as possible. They're friendly, have used tires at great prices and are one of the only places around to offer Nitrogen fills for your tires to extend tire life and reduce leaks. Reasonable pricing, repairs do cost you if you didn't buy the tire from them, but it won't break your bank. Nor do they offer you things you don't need. You tell them what you're looking for, they give you options, no hassle. I highly recommend them!</text>

<text>Went to Fast Tire on Friday before closing to replace one tire and bought it for $42.50 used. Came home put on the tire and immediately it sounded and drove weird. Came back on Saturday after driving only 15miles and come to find out they sold me a bad tire that was separated. Was told I could buy another tire brand new for full price $100 ummmm no. So I asked Reggie how far I could drive on a separated tire, he said he doesn't "recommend  it." But he just sold me a tire less then 24 hours ago that is NOT safe to be on the road. Long story short I got my money back and left the shop with my donut on. Now I have to wait till Monday for anything to be open in oakhurst to get a new tire.<//text>< pictures>

<text>I am so impressed with this place. Got a flat while taking kids to summer camp and myself to work and drove straight here. I arrived at 9:50am they had me pull up on a lift and even let me leave my two year old and 8 year old in the car and by 9:52 they had my tire off and told me no more than 15 minutes to patch it and be on my way. I won't even be late to work today. Fast Tire really lives up to its name. Professional and affordable and best of all fast.....</text>< name>

This place is right next door to the RV park where we are staying. I liked the guy when he came down to help my neighbor in the RV park with his tire issue, and then when we were ready to leave and I noticed that we had a flat too, I was very happy to get an opportunity to take my tire here. These guys are super nice and very professional, and the price was great.< /Text>

Fast Tire in Coarsegold repaired a tire for my vehicle.  Excellent service, very helpful, reasonable prices ... and they didn't try to upsell me something I didn't need.  Good people.  I highly recommend Fast Tire.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I had my tires rotated at a Fresno dealer.  After the rotation, it felt like I was in an earthquake while driving because the tires were off balance.  I didn’t feel safe driving the truck back to Fresno.  This fine establishment was located right next to us so I popped in with out an appointment and they immediately got me in.  They ended up having to dismount the tires from the wheels in order to properly rotate them (I have a dually truck).  Only took them about 20-30 minutes and I was on my merry way... no more shaking while driving.  Reasonably priced, and super fast service??  Count me in.  Thanks guys!< /Review><user_id>102682958339464397578</user_id><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

The end of August my vehicle was rear ended by a distracted driver. I picked Woodland Body Works to complete the repair. The first person I spoke to was Amber. She was super sweet, helpful and answered all my many questions. They were available to give me a quote the very next day and get my vehicle in and serviced within the week. All 3 ladies I’ve encountered in the office have been professional, friendly, knowledgeable & above and beyond helpful (they even helped with setting up a rental car!) fantastic automotive and customer service.</review>

The service was fantastic, efficient and interaction with office staff (Amber) was great.  Amber explained the process thoroughly and was very responsive to my needs and questions.

I would definitely recommend Woodland Body Works.<//review>

<time>1602254769549<//time><Rating>2</Rating><text>Someone crashed into me and the whole front of the car needed to be replaced. They did a great job in replacing everything, which is the only reason I gave 2 stars. Though, when we brought it home we noticed that there was a large scratch on the left side that we knew wasn’t there before. I’ve been trying to call but they always say “I’ll have them call you back. I’m going to put your number on their desk” or they say “I will get back to you tomorrow on it”. I have called several times and they NEVER call me back. They did a great job which is why I am so frustrated that they can’t seem to follow through. If you don’t mind the hassle of getting them to take care of things after they get their money then this is the place for you.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I scheduled a fender repair with Woodland Body Works and not only were the staff friendly and helpful, they serviced my car and had it ready to pick up when they originally said they would be. Everything was done in an efficient manner and they were highly considerate of their customers. Thank you for such awesome service!< /Review>

<Review>I would recommend this place for your vehicles body work. You do have to be proactive on reaching out to them and requesting updates, but all of the people working there are very nice and welcoming. I never felt like I was getting upcharged or swayed in one direction. I will go back to this place if needed in the future.</Review>< pictures>

My car was in a car accident, and getting parts was a problem because of Covid. Woodland Body Works was very attentive in keeping me informed about the work progress, communication with the claims adjuster, car rental company, etc. I highly recommend them for auto repairs.<//Text>

They communicated directly with my insurance company, a rental car was arranged and dropped off at WBW when I took in my car. Paper work was explained and handled efficiently.
I received periodic updates on their progress and had my car back within a few days. Their staff was upbeat, helpful and accommodating of my potential needs.
Woodland is fortunate to have such a well managed  program in town. Glad they work with Triple A. Thank you all!<//review>< Gmap_id>

I used Woodland Body Works to repair my car after an accident. Nicole and Alicia had a rental car ready for me at the time I dropped of my car and kept me updated with the progress of my car.

Beautiful work on replacing our lift gate. It works now, and so do the electric doors, at last!

<Review>Woodland Body Works did an excellent job on my 2008 Ford Pickup truck. First, Rosa dealt with my insurance company very well; had a rental truck waiting there the day I dropped it off; gave me updates on progress of repairs to truck, even rejected faulty parts that was first sent; showed and reviewed repairs with me, even in a rainstorm.
I would recommend Woodland Body Works to any I know who needs  vehicle repair.
Very courteous and professional from start to finish.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1550242423710, 'text': 'It is important to us from start to finish that we are able to provide out customers with great communication and high quality repairs.

<review>Both times we’ve used Woodlane Body Works we’ve had nothing but positive experiences. They’ve taken such good care of my car and have done such a good job of making it look brand new. When I was dealing with insurance after my accident and they determined that the other party was at fault the first question I asked was if I could choose where my car went for repairs and if woodland body works was in their network. Thankfully it was and they did a wonderful job with the repairs. Can’t even tell it was damaged. Thanks guys. ♥️<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Response>None</Response><text>Woodland Body Works did an amazing job on my car, it's tuff just trusting anyone these days to do anything right and honest when it comes to working on your car. I've been thoroughly looking over the work they did and find minor things only I would notice. Nothing to really complain about and I'm sure they will do whatever is needed to make it right. They kept me informed on the progress and I would highly recommend them to my family and friends. They also stand behind their work as long as I own the car.

This shop did a great job on my Lexus LX470. The whole repair process only took 3 days. I had issues with my claim, and the shop took the time to help resolve the issues.</review>

< Review>
I had an accident in my brand new Explorer less than 2 weeks after I bought it. Ronnie advocated for me with my insurance company for OEM parts. The job took a lot longer than expected because of how new my car was and it was difficult to get replacement parts. But when I finally got my car back it was brand new like I never had an accident. Very good quality work. Jimmie is a hoot to chat with and these guys bleed Woodland. Very good people and I trust their work.<//Review>

Everyone in the Sacramento area needs to know about the unbelievably amazing shop I was lucky enough to be recommended to, *woodland body works* a collision pros company located at 1424 E. Main Street in Woodland. !!!!!!
Listen up world this is the only place you need to go to when your car, van, suv or truck needs help!!!
The remarkably clean and professional staff especially including their stellar manager Ms Nicole whom will educate you on any issues, questions comments, or concerns in such a manner it leaves one feeling protected and well cared about by the right people.
Seriously I must say proudly I was truly impressed by all the wonderful technicians and with most regards to the polite professional gentleman there service advisor Mr Michael Kerekes who set my repair plans by accommodating both my schedule and bank account by taking care of my repairs WAY UNDER BUDGET I LOVE this beautiful shop!!!
If your vehicle is broke take it to Woodland Body Works this direct repair shop has the most honest enjoyable atmosphere I have ever seen in the auto repair industry- My experience can only be described as a symphony of superb customer service!!!!
Bringing my Mercedes Benz GL450 to Woodland Body Works was the best decision I could have made in getting it repaired to better than new condition.

They had to take the car back in to fix other errors that were made, now I have a  quickie patch job and new scratches in my paint that he used touch up paint on, looks bad for a brand new car.<//Text><Time>1470158517920< /Time>< user_name>

<resp>None</resp><Text>I walked in for the first time during covid wearing a face shield because due to a medical condition, I cannot wear a face mask, and I have a medical exemption. I was told I could not shop there unless I wore a mask. This is called discrimination and is contrary to the American's Disability Act. The worker was uninformed. I have complied with a face covering for the protection of those around me. No other stores in Gilroy said anything to me as I completed.my errands tonight. I am doing my best to comply with the restrictions just like everybody else. Your employees need to be informed so that those with real disabilities don't get treated as though they are breaking laws.</Text></record>

< review>
If possible, I'd gladly give Reebok ZERO stars. I placed an order on the website a month ago to customize a pair of shoes (it writes it takes 3-4 weeks from design to delivery). Not only I cannot see any order history on the website, but I heard nothing back from Reebok. I just called them about its whereabouts, their representative told me the policy has changed and it will take around another month so suck it up. Her attitude  is more than arrogant and horrible. I really don't think I'll buy ANYTHING from Reebok EVER again.< /review>

This is a wonderful veterinary office! The staff are all pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful. They were able to work with me in regards to price while still ensuring that my cat received the best possible care. Nancy was kind, pleasant, and highly accommodating, and our veterinarian, Dr. Jessica Gallo, was absolutely wonderful. Her expertise was only rivaled by her kindness. I would 100% recommend this business to my friends and family, and will be taking my pets here for any other veterinary services in the future.</Text>

<user_name>Laura Jeskey-Legan<//user_name><Review>My Dog Barney was in good hand. He went in looking like he was dying and would have if he didn't get the necessary fluids and care that Cottage gave him. He is jumping around like a puppy again a day after he came home.  What I liked most about the whole experience was how they were so open to my questions and emotions. They called me often with updates on his condition and let me in on all procedures as they went along. I wasn’t worried for long and I didn’t have to wait until they called me to pick him up to know who he was doing.  I felt like I made the right choice and trusted them to do what was needed in his condition. Thank you Cottage and to all your staff. I saw the operations your are running during this Pandemic full of impossibilities and you still made everyone feel like their precious pet mattered to you. I saw others worried about their pets and witnessed how quickly everyone handled the crowd of cars pulling up in which your methods of taking their pets for them to return later for pick up was done in the utmost care, order and without incident. Five stars Cottage Pet Hospital, you will be the first one I call from now on.
Sincerely,
Laura (and Barney) Legan< /Review>< Pics>

Read the negative reviews. It will save your baby's life. This vet has lost his passion. He does not care for his patients. If he no longer cares he should just stop practicing. His staff is a reflection of him. Just like him, they don't care about your fur babies. Please find another vet that will treat you and your best friends with the dignity and respect you both deserve. My last few visits to this place have been a nightmare. He doesn't show his face to acknowledge his mistakes. He will send his staff that show no emotion towards your pain. Avoid this place at all costs, It is a matter of life and death. Show your fur babies you love them by taking to them somewhere that cares!</Text>

I dropped my pet off in the morning and was told to call at 3. I did so and told them I would be heading over. When I got there I called again to let them know I was there and the person who answered asked for my name, etc. After waiting 40 minutes I called again and someone else answered, took my info again and said they would have them out soon. Then it took another 30 minutes. There was zero communication and each person I spoke to acted like they would have the pet right out. It was a complete waste of time because if I call at 3 why would it take until 5 to release them? Why didn't any staff mention that, for whatever reason, it would be quite a wait?
All interactions I had with the staff in the afternoon were terse, bordering on rude. I talked to at least 3 different people and their vibes felt like I was a total inconvenience that I wanted my pet back.
And to top this experience off they shorted us on the pet's pain medicine.
In my opinion, don't bother with this place they will literally waste your time.</text>

<Review>I took my cat Jeorgie in on Black Friday when almost no one else was available. My little brat had a fight with some other cat and came back with a huge bite mark on his hip.
The staff at Cottage  Pet Hospital were very helpful and the doctor laid out our options for us (use anti-biotics & wait OR do a surgery). She explained the pros and cons for each option  and gave us time to consider.
We chose go with the anti-biotics. The hospital called to check on Jeorgie  twice  and asked me questions in regards to his wound, to make sure the medication was working and its healing properly.

They also sent Jeorgie a card at the end of two weeks wishing him all the best.
So All in all an amazing place to take your pet. They really care about the animals that come into their clinic and are great at following up on your fur baby's health and recovery.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEshcYs6c1_ifQflWRGSGeOSA2r75tsiZ7SfbV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI7KL6eNGHxihuJVAQJe1ZoPxI2waDxUA65FP4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I love this place!! I brought my cat here with an upper respiratory infection and they were so thorough and so helpful. After diagnosing her with asthma, Dr. Gallo was (and continues to be) so patient with my hundreds of questions. We don’t have pet insurance so the x-rays were pricey, but the prescription medications we were given are relatively affordable. I can’t recommend this practice enough, they are excellent!<//review>

I made an appointment at 2:00 went to my appointment and was told my appointment was at 3:15. OK I made the appointment that day just a few hours before I went to the appointment so there’s no way it was at three ,the receptionist lied. They charge way too much most likely Because of the remodeling.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>On Friday 11/13 they gave my cat to a stranger, to a different client/pet owner than me and they did not even realize it until I asked where my cat was. Once again they gave my cat to the wrong person and that person drove away to their house with my cat.

I got there at 4PM after waiting outside for 2 hours I asked where my cat was since they had said they would bring him out about 30 mins prior. It took until 7:30PM for them to return my cat to me because they had sent one of their techs to go pick it up from someone else's house... They lied to me about 5 different times, around 6:30PM I started calling asking them what was going on, they first told me there was an emergency, then that they were really busy, etc.

I don't understand how they made such a huge mistake but the worse is that they tried to shove this under the rug, they told me the owner would call me the next day. This person never reached out, talked to their lead vet Dr. Sahai a week ago and never got a call back. It is disappointing to know that they don't care about their patients or their customers at all.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I think they charge too much and the assistants are very friendly and helpful. I didn't like the fact that it takes forever to get a doctor to call back with test results. I'm going to be taking my pet elsewhere for better service and pricing.</review>< Pictures>

Aside from waiting for an hour after arriving to pick my pet up (called first too), they gave us empty packets of medicine for my kitties.

<review>All of the staff have been very kind and efficient from entering the office to the end of the visit.  They are very knowledgeable, and very aware of your own financial situation when this is an issue. They do not pressure you.  They have been reasonable in the fees for various visits for both our cat and dog.  Their hours are the most convenient I have seen.  I highly, let me say, HIGHLY recommend Cottage Pet Hospital for your pets health needs.</review>< Pictures>

I've been coming here since I moved to SoCal and they've been very helpful and caring towards my dogs. Staff is always nice and gentle with my dogs and very helpful whenever I have questions. Since the 5 years I've been going to them they've had a number of different doctors which is the only draw back for me. Side note, the place looks great after their remodel.<//text>

I wanted to take a moment and thank Stephanie. No matter when I call or what questions I have, she is always helpful and kind. Stephanie was there for me when I had to say goodbye to two of my fur babies. I could tell she hurt as much as I did. I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else. Thank you all!</Text>

We are new to California and we had not chosen a vet for my older dog, Rudy, yet when he started to get sick late Saturday night (of course over the weekend) when we were lucky enough to be referred to Cottage Per Hospital. They were able to get him in within half an hour of my call on a SUNDAY MORNING!! What?! Yes, you read that right! Crystal at the front desk was very quick to sign us in and Dr. Robby put both Rudy and I at ease and was very thorough with his exam. I'm happy to say that Rudy is feeling better and that we have found our new California vet! Rudy and I highly recommend Cottage Pet Hospital!< /text>

< Review>
This has been an overdue review of our overall experience at The Cottage Pet Hospital.
Which has been a pleasant experience from the moment I picked up my phone to call and investigate pricings and booking an appointment. I was greeted by Liz , she took her time in answering all of my questions over the phone. She seemed calmed and pleasant and very informative.
My chihuahua had some type of paw allergies/rash. Being that we were first time customers they had to evaluate  her. It turned out to be  a common grass allergic reaction . She was given an injection that lasted a month and  since then it has cleared. She is due to  come back in soon, for the same reason. The cost of the consultation was reasonable.
Over all our experience was great. We arrrived and was finally able to meet Liz the girl I spoke with over the phone . And was  greeted  the same with the utmost respect and she was a pleasure. She took care of my Roxy!
The staff in general seemed very nice with the office having a general great atmosphere/ vibe!
I will be recommending this place to my friends and family . For all of their pet needs!< /Review>

<Review>I am so glad to have found this place at such short notice. My little 16 year old senior Chihuahua fell ill over a weekend and they were there for me when I needed them the most. Unfortunately, I had to let my dog Rest In Peace for financial reasons, his age and the state he was in. This hospital had very reasonable costs for the blood work and X-rays and all the diagnosing tests. The euthanasia procedure is not something to ever look forward to, but the staff here and the Dr’s made it very calm and comfortable for my little baby dog. I will forever be grateful for the peace that you have given my little Cujo. Thank you all so much.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I finally got around to reviewing this place!
I woke up one morning to find my elderly buddy had some kind of wound on his bottom. I was freaking out trying to think what could have happened. I looked up a decent vet online since my usual go to had a ridiculous wait time. The staff there was so kind and understanding. Liz helped us and assured me he would be well taken care of. I let her know he's very old and sensitive and I was pleased she handled him with the utmost care. Everything was explained thoroughly by the Dr. and I left feeling relieved. I definitely reccomend this place!<//Text><Date>1551990862382< /Date><resp>None</resp><UserId.>108277278284141164132</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80dcd639b105604d:0xffb719dde3017c59<//Gmap_id>< pictures>

Cottage Pet Hospital is a great place to take your loved pet.  They made me feel comfortable leaving my pup to get neutered.  The staff was pleasant when I dropped her off in the morning and they called and gave me updates on how she was feeling after surgery.  Top notch Vet & Staff!</review>

We love Cottage Pet Hospital!  Dr. Sahai is a very personable and knowledgeable doctor.  In fact, the other doctors and staff are all very personable and knowledgeable too!  We feel the pricing is fair and the care is very good.  We trust them so much that we still take our cat there even after we moved to another city.  We highly recommend Cottage Hospital.<//text>

I cannot say enough nice things about Cottage Pet Hospital.  We have had several dogs over the last 10 years and they have all been treated here.  We have been to other vet offices, but we keep coming back here...for a reason.  They take good care of our babies.</Review>

The service was always very polite and prompt, and Dr. Sahai saved our cat's life several times. Their equipment and procedures are state-of-the-art, and the veterinarians and staff are all very knowledgeable. They really care about the animals. When our old cat died, we adopted two rescue kittens who are now patients at Cottage Pet Hospital. Their veterinarian, Dr. Jimenez, is very knowledgeable and clearly enjoys the patients. Our cats respond very well to her gentle style. We are looking forward to many years with our kittens and with Cottage Pet Hospital.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Friendly staff who cares deeply for the wellbeing of your pet. Been coming here for about 4 years after trying to find a competent vet that didn't just dismiss my cat who was almost dying as a minor allergy. Cottage hospital quickly prescribed antibiotics and my cat went back to his healthy self in about a week. I wouldn't take my pets to any other clinic.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The office and clinical staff at college pet hospital or warm, welcoming and clearly capable.
For example: My dog Molly does not like to get on the scale for her weight. They are very patient with her while trying to get her on the scale and to standstill. After this she willingly accompanies them to the back.
The doctors are also wonderful. They are clinically very strong and have great bedside manners.
Their hours are very convenient and they make appointments as well as taking walk-ins. What more could you ask?< /text>

<text>I adopted a dog from this pet hospital and I was so moved by how well they treated this poor fellow. He had been left by his family who never returned and during that time, they took such good care of him. I was notified by a friend that maybe I would like to adopt him which I did. They were so careful in interviewing me to make sure I was going to be a good pet owner. I think they are really great people< /text><rate>5</rate>< Date>

My dog was hit by a car the Thursday before a holiday weekend (a tragic accident occurred and technically both my dogs were hit the same night but I won't go into detail in this review).   He was less than a year old and weighed 6lbs. The only vets open were ER vets.  He needed surgery immediately and the cost of surgery at the ER vet was astronomical.  Cottage Pet hospital went above and beyond to help me and my 8month old rescue, Bradley.  The assistant who answered the phone said she wanted to call the doctor (on his day off) to see what they could do.  Minutes later the doctor called and told me he wanted to help and was going to find a way to get the surgery done despite the fact that they would be closed in addition to several other hurdles that made the task seem impossible to me.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing and I wondered whether everything would work out as the dr explained.  It did.  Because the doctor cared more about my dogs life than profit, today I have a fully functional healthy 18month old.  I'm convinced that there is a special place in heaven for people this who value life and health and will do ALL they can to save it.  I can't thank cottage per hospital enough.  They are the kindest people I've met and have the best place to bring my pets.< /Text>

They took great care of my dog "SPECK" up until his death and even after death they didn't stop caring. I had my dog cremated and they did an amazing job with the ashes and a keepsake paw print, dog tag and a clipping of his hair.  It made it a little easier to have the keepsakes and to know that they don't stop caring just because your animal dies.

I highly recommend them to anyone with a pet.< /review>

I have had great service from Cottage Pet Hospital over the past  2 years for both  my dogs and cats!  Dr.Sahai guided me in caring for my diabetic dog after he diagnosed him. He is both compassionate and professional and I know he and his staff give great care to the pets we bring to them.<//Review>

The staff is great! The prices are affordable & they never try to upsell on things we don't need. They always make recommendations & work with us to make sure our fur babies are well taken care of. They even called to follow up on how my baby was doing after surgery. We have been taking our fur babies to Cottage for over 4 years. We have always received the best care and friendliest service. We love Cottage!< /Review>

<text>This place is a RIP off...my wife took our cat a while ago cuz he had diarrhea, and despite having an appointment, she waited abt an hour
before the dr come to examine our cat...they told my wife over the phone that the charge for the service, will be $45,but she end up pay little over $100😡,also they asked her for her ss#🤔🤨 very weird and suspicious since she was going to pay cash.

Today my wife called em to check abt mail trimming for our dog,she was told it cost $15,but when we went there,they told her that she had to pay an extra $45 to examine the dog,which was never mentioned over the phone when she called!!!

This place is a big RIP off!!

Dr's and staff are really welcoming. I went on the search for a new vet because I couldn't bear to walk in to the vet I had been going to because that's where we had to put down my cat of 15+ years with cancer. Just the thought of it made me break down into tears. I took my other  cat here on an emergency and was accommodated to the schedule and my cat and I left happy campers.  Prices were reasonable. I'm glad I found a new place for my furry ones.<//text>

<review>Our girl Belle had to have surgery to remove a benign growth, she was very scared and nervous and so was I, however the staff at Cottage Pet Hospital was very caring and gentle. Her growth was removed, and she was home that same afternoon. Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very professional.

We were traveling with, our 16 year old Yorkie girl, Pepper when she let us know it was her time to go to the Rainbow Bridge.
I called Cottage Pet Hospital and spoke to Nancy.  She explained how Pepper's final journey would be handled.
We took Pepper in on 12/03/2016 and said our tearful goodbyes.
Everyone there was very caring and we appreciate them so much for that during such a difficult time.
We later received a sympathy card signed by the whole staff.< /text>

I would like to thank cottage pet hospital for treating my dog when she really needed it. She had a very bad infection which caused her to lose her hair and develop a very bad rash. The Dr. treated her and gave me some pointers. I also got a shampoo to help cure her rash and help bring her hair back and get rid of the infection. She is now 5 years old and healthy as can be! I couldn't be more happy. I'm not too sure what I would've done without my baby girl! Thank you Cottage for saving her life.< /text>

**********PET OWNERS BEWARE********
My dog was diagnosed by Dr Sahai with heart failure approx over a year ago. He put my dog on Vetmedin, Lasix & Enalapril. Dr Sahai continued to authorize refills but not without a price. HIS policy requires unnecessary exams, bloodwork, urinalysis, xrays, etc. EVEN if your pet is on the last of their days in order to refill my dogs meds. I wanted my dog to be able to continue her meds the dr claims she needed. Although these meds did not help subside alot of her symptoms I feel like it slowed down the progression of her illness. With that said, it was time for yet another refill. So I called the office & Dr Sahai would not authorize another refill without an exam, bloodwork & urinalysis. No exceptions! So I took her in for her another exam. The front office staff tried to push additional testing yet again. We refused & said we would prefer to speak to the dr who is going to perform the exam. As we were already aware the “fill in” doctor stated our dog could pass any day now. He understood that we only came in because we had to & all we wanted was to refill her meds to keep her as comfortable for as long as possible until she passed. Tests weren’t going to help my dog in any way whatsoever. Tests were only going to tell us what we already knew & that is our dogs condition is getting worse. Anyhow, the fill in dr was very compassionate, withdrew ALL “so called required tests”, refilled her meds & we were on our way.  Today I called for another refill. Dr Sahai refused to authorize without the tests. He obviously only cares about money & not your pet. He didn’t care that she is dying. Once he found out I was gonna post this review he called me to harass me & because I hung up on him he called my husband & tried to offer him a discount for further testing instead of authorizing a refill. ***IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET, DO NOT COME TO COTTAGE PET HOSPITAL!!!!!***<//text>

We take absolute pride of how we treat and care for the patients who walk through our door.

Best pet hospital in town.
Fully recommended if you think your pet is part of your family.
Big thanks to Dr Sahai who has been taking care of my pets from last 18 years. I have been taking 3 generations of my dogs to cottage pet hospital.
Dr Sahai is very professional. He will never suggest any extra medication or treatment if ur pet doesn’t need it. He treats ur pets as his pet.
And for his whole team there is only one word:- AWESOME.< /text>

<Name>Yolanda Roebeck</Name><review>I took my dog, Lucky, here whenever he needed anything done. The staff has always been so kind and friendly. Last year, Lucky got so old that he couldn't stand as long, found it difficult to breathe and could no longer control his bladder. After nearly 16 years together, it was time to say goodbye. The staff allowed us as much time as we needed to say goodbye before and after the injection. A couple of weeks later, we received a condolences card from Cottage Pet Hospital. That extra mile they took by sending that card was just the most beautiful gesture and I will forever be grateful for how understanding and caring the staff were in one of the saddest moments in my life.</review>< Response>

I've tried a number of different vets in and around Anaheim over the years. I was looking for the ones who seemed the most competent, the most compassionate and who also provide care that we can afford.  We have found our veterinary home with Cottage Pet Hospital Inc.  Dr. Sahai was amazingly compassionate, skilled and dedicated. Him his staff have gone way beyond our expectations in helping us care for our family dog who had a very serious and difficult to treat condition.  They have worked with us in a collaborative way such us listening carefully to our concerns and gave us suggestions for the care of our dog.  We will be forever grateful for their help through that very difficult time.  If you want an amazing vet for your dog or cat, look no further.</review>

<Text>I agree to Marti S. You must know I am the one who visit you this afternoon for the first time.

First, I already mentioned that I have a primary vet but it is closed on Sunday. I was worried that my boy wasn’t able to eat for few or several days. I came to get something that I can feed him. Fluid subcutaneous wasn't what I looked for, though I was looking for something else.

Doctor recommended me to hospitalize my boy. I should have straightly answered him that I am uncomfortable about hospitalizing because it could have killed him. He suggested many things, but I wanted to try again after he eats and gets energized. And, of course, I can do them in my primary vet. Reason for visit was to give him something since he couldn’t eat for awhile.

Things he recommended was total (around) $680. I chose to fluid subcutaneous and something that might help me to eat. As soon as the receptionist went out, I heard the doctor said, “That’s it?!” I should have left this place already. The receptionist’s attitude was, honestly disturbing.

Even at the emergency vet and other vets, I never needed to sign a paper *attached photo* I became very anxious signing the paper, which  I should have declined and walked out, after heard the doctor said, “That’s it?!” and with the attitude of the receptionist. I wasn’t able to trust them who took my boy back to the room. Are they upset because I refused the recommendation? What if they make my boy even sick?

And thank you. I don’t know what you have done to him. Or even if you didn’t do anything, I can tell my boy didn’t have a positive experience like at my primary vet.

He sounded very weak on the way back to home. Have no idea why but he started to have a breathing problem and became even weaker. I want to trust you, but I don’t know.

Sorry for only accepting “that’s it?!” options.

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>We live in Sacramento. Around 2005 we had a family vacation in Disneyland. Our Lhasa Apso dog named Lucy was still very young and had a lot of separation anxiety, When I found out the Cottage Pet Hospital was in Anaheim, we decided to take Lucy with us in our road trip and board her at the Cottage.

It was great to us to be able to visit Lucy each afternoon after our Disney events. The Hospital did a check up, and we were very impressed with the human warmth the staff treated us and the pets. Lucy had a great time since she was able to be with us in the road trip and we visited her everyday.

We liked Cottage Pet Hospital very much, and still remember after all this time.< /review>< Pics>

<time>1539881251639< /time><Review>Our kitty started having either a weird cough or asthma attack. I took a video and showed it to the Dr, who said to bring in the kitty ASAP. We mentioned we live 15 min away and they close in 15 min, so we asked if it was super urgent or if we should just come back the next day -- but Dr. Sahai said he wanted to see our kitty now and it wouldn't be a problem to show up a little late. We took 15 min to come back, I called on the way to confirm and gave our ETA and the nurse said it would be fine, however when we got there a few min later they wouldn't open their door. I had my cat with me on the sidewalk and knocked at least 15 times before they finally opened the door. A different nurse answered the door, raised her voice at me that the power was already shut down and everyone had left, and shut the door in my face as I explained we had JUST CALLED to confirm it was okay to show up 5 min late. It wasn't even 5 minutes past close.

We absolutely loved this vet up until then and never came back. If it wasn't for this instance I would give 5 stars.

Pros are:
+ Dr. Sahai is wonderful and absolutely amazing at diagnosis while being practical about cost (aka without going into debt)
+ If you are upfront in a polite manner or are like me and super stressed when you pet is sick (and have a million questions), the nurses will do whatever they can to help
+ No appointments needed on weekends for shots, it's a quick and easy
+ (Most) of the staff seem to really love pets and care about their well-being! Our pets love people and bond with the staff when they are in for treatment, which we really love and puts us at ease

Cons:
- There is a sarcastic doctor here that we do not jive well with, we feel she is not as straightforward when we ask her questions and she will often joke to us about how she never brings in her pets to the vet and just lets stuff in their bodies "work out on their own" (how is that professional).
- Sometimes staff would contradict the doctor's advice when we'd ask questions we thought of later -- I think you'll get this anywhere though
- They never remember my pet insurance covers flea medicine! Every time I come in and buy it, I have to pay full price and then get my insurance to work with Cottage Pet Hospital on proactively applying my discount and refunding me the rest. I think they don't even take my insurance anymore, good riddance anyway because I don't need a vet that will tell me to bring in my cat and they'll stay open for me, only to shut the door in my face.<//Review>< Name>

Give these folks a shot if you're searching around, you won't regret it. Thanks for everything Cottage Pet Hospital</Review></record>

Two years ago I had the bright idea that I would make some money on the side doing dog breeding. So I went out and bought a female French bulldog. Pure breed, paperwork, and all the bells and whistles. This thing cost me almost 5 grand. Well long story short that bright idea didn't workout to well.
I have been bringing little Misty to The Cottage Pet Hospital since the first day I brought her home. I don't have any dramatic life threatening stories about Misty but I guess that in itself is a compliment to Dr. S. He has always treated us like family, making sure Misty gets all her treatments and at the right time. As a first time dog owner, it was rough but I made it through thanks mostly in part to the staff at Cottage Pet Hospital. So I felt like should take some time and write something in their favor. Hope this review helps.<//Review>

The staff here are caring, kind and personable. The Dr.s are very good, and when my cat decided to eat 3 ft of yarn, they were great at progress reports and caring for my "inappropriate snack" kitty! She came through it without unnecessary and expensive surgery.
They do not push procedures that are costly and unnecessary, but will present all options to you.
They also worked with my little feral rescue. That was awesome.<//Review>

I had to take my dog in to be seen when she got an infection. I was so worried about what was going on with my girl and they worked to keep not just my dog calm, but me as well. The service I received there is some of the best I ever have. I highly recommend them to my friends with fur children. :)</Review>

This place always felt like an extension to our family. We went only a handful of times but every time was caring, attentive and respectful. Structure-wise it's not Beverly Hills but that didn't seem to matter.

I'm devastated to say our four legged grandma's cancer got the best of her but I couldn't have asked for a better team to help us through the most difficult decision of helping her rest. They were supportive at every which way and not only thoroughly informative but a level of sympathy that allowed me to process everything without feeling judged or alone in the process, ultimatley helping me make a decision that I felt was best. From the bottom of my heart, I am grateful for this place and it's staff.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I adopted my senior chihuahua in January. One thing that comes with adopting a new pet is that you have no idea what their previous medical history is. My chihuahua is blind in one eye and was in dire need of a teeth cleaning. I was worried at first about putting my dog under due to his age but both Dr. Sahai and Dr. Ahrabi took the time to discuss the procedure with me and I felt much better. I also told them about a little cough I noticed him having lately. They were just as concerned as I was and suggested we take a few x-rays to see what the issue was. What my previous doctor told me were allergies ended up being a problem with his trachea and minor heart murmur. My dog is now on a healthy diet and medication to help him with these issues. While he lost a few teeth, his behavior has completely changed. He is happy and plays all the time! The care I received from everyone at this hospital has truly touched my heart. My dog is a senior and I know that I may only have a few years with him but they will be happy and healthy. Just talking with the staff you will understand how much they truly care about your animals. Seeing my dog happy and smiling was enough for me. I will never go anywhere else.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

From the first day we walked in with Gizmo the staff and Dr. Sahai have been amazing with our Baby. I am so glad we found Cottage Pet Hospital. They diagnosed Gizmo with Cushing Syndrome and together we worked out a treatment plan. We are very happy with the service they provide. Gizmo even likes going in for her check ups. Thank you Cottage Pet Hospital for making us a part of the family.<//text>

Cottage Pet Hospital offers a warm atmosphere and caring staff in convenient location for local residents.

Pet Treatment: I brought my cat in for treatment after she started scooting across the carpet. Without getting into details the diagnosis was quick and treatment was effective.

Facility: There is a strong smell in this facility similar to most animal shelters I've been in. The staff do constantly clean but the building is dated and may have absorbed years of patient odors. I often see the staff cleaning and disinfecting after each patient and they are currently remodeling the facility so hopefully they will be able to reduce the smell.

Price: The prices for treatment seem comparable to that of Banfield Pet Hospitals found in most Petsmarts. They also seem to accept most insurance plans.

Parking: Since this is a small clinic parking is limited and street side parking is typically taken my near by residents. However, there is usually at least one or two spots open from my experience.<//Text>

I took our twin kittens to CPH for a check up just to make sure they were doing good. The staff was super nice and the doctor was great with the twins! I plan on taking them back here for their yearly check ups.</Review>

<review>My mom got a puppy for her birthday last month as a gift from my father, and he was always active and by her side. She only had him for a month before they killed him with the simplest procedure. Do NOT trust them with anesthesia or sedatives, the dog went in for a simple procedure to get it's bandages removed and replaced and they put him to sleep for it. Why? I have no idea. He wasn't vicious and never growled at anyone. He was just a puppy. I'm a vet assistant myself, and anywhere will tell you that is malpractice. Not only did they overdose him and kill a perfectly healthy, active, and happy family member; they put him to sleep the day before for the same reason. Again, anywhere else will tell you not to sedate a puppy or any small animal within 24 hours of a previous dose of anesthesia. It was Dr. Ahrabi. He didn't even have the nerve to apologize to my father who went in and picked up the puppy's collar and say goodbye. My whole family is heartbroken, the puppy really brightened everyone's day with his happy and active attitude. My mom hasn't eaten or slept much, she is heartbroken beyond belief. She treats every animal like a child of her own, and I inherited that from her. They killed her puppy, our family member, and then called her shortly after; asking her to come in to fill out forms to cremate him. She had to send my father in, and we answered the phone for her, as she couldn't bare to talk to them after what they did. We heard them changing stories on what had happened each time they attempted to explain it. We are pursuing legal action for this malpractice and emotional distress and damage this has caused our family, especially to my mom. BEWARE. BE CAUTIOUS. Don't just assume that because they have a high average of reviews, they won't do the same to your family member. No animal should be sedated for a simple procedure just because the vet is scared to get bitten, that's part of the job you signed up for. If you know how to properly restrain an animal, you don't need drugs to get something done. I want to inform others of what they've done to prevent this from happening any other companions.<//review>< pictures>

I have been bringing my dog, Tammy, to Dr. Sahai for about 3 years now and she is doing great.  Dr. Sahai and his staff are the best and take excellent care of Tammy.  Tammy has a couple of conditions that are a bit rare and not on most Vet's radar, so it is with certainty that I say Tammy is alive because of the care that she gets at Cottage Pet Hospital.  I would recommend Cottage Pet Hospital to anyone with a pet.<//review>

<review>Very nice people! Didn't try to sell me EVERY vaccination/shot they offered, as other vet clinics do. I went with no appointment and was in and out very quickly. No complaints.

I came in because my cat had an abscess on her face that ruptured blood all over my kitchen. I freaked out and took work off to take her to a vet. They cleaned it up nicely and gave her an antibiotic in a shot and  in a gel for me to rub on in her ear for a few weeks. They didn't guilt me into spending 300+ dollars on a bunch of other things as other places had.</review><date>1488342060353</date>< userid>

<Text>My girlfriend has this chubby little trouble maker Pug breed dog name Lucas. At this Christmas family party, he was playing about and suddenly we realized that there was a bar of chocolate (herseys) opened  and he ate half of the bar. Since we've been told that if dogs ate chocolate, they might die, we got frighten and we didn't know what to do.

One of my family members told us about Cottage Pet Hospital and we rushed the Lucas to there right away. This waiting period was a nightmare for us. After the examined Lucas, they told us that everything would be OK and just to be more careful next time. BOY were we relief.

Cottage Pet Hospital did a great and professional job. In the end, we are very glad everything was good.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am not actually a client of Cottage Pet Hospital.
However, I had an experience with them when a friend and I found a lost dog.
We took him there to be checked for a chip. Because we were going to board him for a day, they took my information of course.
Even though the owner was found while we were still there, the file remained active.
Then I started to get nasty grams from the shelter that his Rabies vacc. was past due. Though I wrote 3 times and called twice, these people are apparently morons. (The shelter.)
After much frustration, I reached out to Cottage for help. I wish I could recall the name of the Office Manager who helped me, but it has been a while.
She was so helpful.
She faxed the entire story and situation to the shelter for me. She did not have to do that. That finally straightened it out and I stopped receiving notices.
As far as I could see, the staff were all very friendly, the office was clean, and if I did not have a long term vet I love, I would probably go there.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I contacted Cottage Pet Hospital because I had the unfortunate, yet inevitable duty of putting my dear friend to sleep. It was an emotional moment for the family and the staff handled it with great kindness and care. If a friend was ever in need of such a service, I would definitely recommend them here.

Of course you should always call ahead to make sure you get a the right service/price quote for what you're looking for. I ended up only needing the cremation services :(. It was a little bit extra, but we sprung for the small box of ashes and paw print on a clay disk, $125. They also sent me a nice card in the mail that the staff signed. It was a nice touch.<//Review>

<Review>My puppy is a small chihuahua mix, she's only 9 months, still a baby and I regret having her spayed by cottage pet hospital. I've had plenty of puppies/dogs in the past and their spaying process was NOTHING like this. They asked me to drop my puppy off between 7:30am-9am and that the sooner I brought her the sooner they could start and finish. I drop her off at 7:30am and they tell me she'll be sitting in a kennel from 7:30am until they start at noon. When I asked why she had to wait so long and if we could wait with her as she has never been kenneled, I was told "that's our procedure and you cannot wait with her". When I picked her up after her surgery her tail was between her legs, she was shaking, had a swollen neck, butchered nails all cut different lengths and into her quick, with the most swollen butchard scar I've EVER seen out of all 6 dogs I've had my whole life. When we got home later than night and I removed her bandage and I had to get heavy duty scissors just to cut through it because it had hardened from how much blood had soaked and dried through the bandage. She took two days to come out of her drug state and start eating again. Never again will I take another puppy of mine there. After she gets her stitches get removed, we will be going to Banfeild Pet Hospital  from petsmart for her check ups. This was surprising to me as normally they are very great, however, they seemed to have been busy that day we took her in so I feel they clearly brushed her aside and "manhandled" her surgery to ensure they get through all their patients. I was very saddened.<//Review><name>Gabrielle Ramirez<//name><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>My maltese just gave birth to 4 pups and we had no idea what to do. We googled like a crazy person and decided on this place. I did not had to wait long like other nearby places.

The doctor was very professional and did not try to up sell me on anything. They listened to every worry I had because they knew that my pets were my kids.

I have never been to this hospital for visits. My 8 year old yorkie, Rocky, recently passed away. My friend found the hospital on her phone and called asking about burial service. The receptionist was very helpful. She gave us all the information and directions to the hospital. We had 15 mins to make it at the 630pm cut off time. When we arrived they were very sweet and sympathatic. I was too upset to talk and my friend had to handle everything for me. I am so thankful for everyone in the hospital. They had sent out a card to me the next day. It was signed by all the employees including the doctors. Seeing that card made me broke down and cried. I felt very touched and love sent from the hospital.  I did not expect that. I appreciate the thoughtfulness from the hospital. I feel like Rocky is in good hands and it made me feel a lot better knowing the fact that people who don't even know you can still care about your loss. Thank you Cottage Pet Hospital.<//review>

My dog Dahab and I went to Cottage Pet Hospital to get him neutered and have his shots. Poor Dahab was so scared but the vet was very accomadating and calmed him down. Customer service is a plus, they were very friendly and helped out when they needed to. The prices are decent so it won't break the bank thankfully. I'm for sure  going to be coming here again.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Best place ever!! Let me start off by saying I can be a real, well let say a difficult customer or patron... :0 Well I came in to nice staff, and yes, the Dr was very personable! She explained things to the point of drawing on a napkin the details of how the mouth works and why my doggy was having issues...(i so wanted to keep that drawing to brag how awesome she was! lol) The other thing was price. I make very little, and I mean VERY LITTLE money so when they gave me pricing finally they werent upselling things to get my money. It was more of here is what it cost.. with what they recommend, then extra options if I was interested but no pressure, then showing me what options are recommended, but not nessesary, to cut my cost as much as possible. They didnt look at me as if I was a bad dog owner for not getting an antibiotic because to me it wasnt nessesary but done as a precaution, or dental check up while she was under for something else. They were just really great! Thnx for taking care of my brat, Princess! I learned alot!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1478290712190, 'text': 'Our pleasure!!'}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd639b105604d:0xffb719dde3017c59</Gmap_id></record>

I have been coming to this pet hospital for over 6 years. AT first I was very pleased with my pets' care, but the past few visits I have been over charged. The Dr. makes me feel like everthing that he recommends is urgent and necessary, causing me to spend more on vet bills than I can afford. Now I am in debt for about $3,000 or more by using care credit. The last time I was there was this month, May 2016, and I was required to get blood work done on my 9 year old cat before he would clean her teeth. I asked for the presurgical pannel and was being charged for the full blood panel and urinalysis add on. I had to complain that this was not what I wanted and the ladies in the front made a big deal about it because the lab work was already performed. I was able to pay the amount of the smaller panel, but only after much debate. Then a few days later I called becuase I wanted to pick up some cat food for my cat that has kidney issues and was told that the vet requires me to have  blood work done for my cat before I could pick up the prescritption diet KD eventhough they knew I was just there a few days ago and spent $700 to get my cat's teeth cleaned. I am very upset with this pet hospital now and will not reccommend this place to anyone. All the vet caares about is charging for anything and everything that he can get. He doesnt care about his repeat loyal customers. He just wants more money to put towards the add-on to the pet hospital that they are currently working on. I suggest you find a vet that will tell you the truth in what is really needed and not make you feel that uneccessary things are.</text>

The entire process was smooth. There was no pressure, no gimmicks. I felt the price was very fair and Adam responded to all my questions promptly and courteously. The car was ready the day after it arrived at the dealership, and the on-site experience was fast and smooth -- I was all done in about an hour. The finance dept was similarly straightforward and easy to work with, with just one small mention of an extended warranty (easily declined), and nothing underhanded. I will definitely be buying my next BMW from Adam and Peter Pan.<//Text>< resp>

<Review>My experience with Peter Pan BMW was great! This weekend I came in to check out a couple of cars they had as it was time for an upgrade and Henry was extremely helpful and made this process a breeze. He approached us and was very courteous and informative. I ended up test driving two vehicles, which never once felt like a hassle or as if we were being rushed.  I was very happy with the customer service I received and felt as thought I had a friend assisting me with the process.  Not once did I feel like I was being rushed into making any kind of decision.  The next day I came in to lock in the deal and it was such a smooth process. Henry  took his time and went through the numbers and paperwork with me. Shortly after, I finished up with the finances department and before you know it, I was driving off the lot with my new car that had just been detailed and buffed in under two hours. This is by far the best experience I've had at a dealer and I will definitely be returning to this location if ever in need.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1621903224306, 'text': "Hi Paulie!

The customer service was thoughtful, sensitive. It has been my best experience buying a BMW. This is my third BMW. By far, this is the best experience I have had at a dealership. In fact, when I left Peter Pan, I wasn’t even tired. Smooth. Thoughtful. I felt well treated. Thank you. And, a special Thank You to Khalil.</Review>

On Tuesday, I bought this beautiful car! It’s a 2021 BMW 330i. Let me just say this experience was amazing! The salesman was super friendly and super helpful. He’s patient, respectful, kind, and the perfect person to go to if you need a new car! He will honestly take the time out of his day to make sure you are satisfied!  He helped me pick the perfect car for me! It’s the perfect model, color, interior, and so much more! If it wasn’t for his help, I would have never been able to pick my dream car! When we went to finance, the guy was also super amazing! He was funny and light-hearted. He made the long process fun! Overall, I would rate this experience a 1000/10 if I could. I will definitely be back in the future!</Review>

Their reviews really speak for themselves. Excellent dealership. Even better employees! Henry is the absolute best. He helped me buy my car and made sure everything was perfect- above and beyond. Super great person, trustworthy and very responsive. He set everything up for me quickly and easily.  The gentleman who detailed my car was exceptional as well. Thank you for helping me get my perfect car!!!</Review>

Recently I had the wonderful opportunity to purchase a BMW X3. Before going to Peter Pan we had explored other dealers and BMW dealers in the area and our experiences left us discouraged thinking that my expectations in a car were not possible. The purchase of my dream car would not have been possible with out the hard work of their service provider Henry.

Henry worked hard for two days to make this incredible purchase happen. While working with him I felt as though he was working in the best of his customer, really taking into account what I was looking for in a car. He also had the car detailed and waxed before driving it off of the lot.

I couldn't be more thankful to Peter Pan BMW and Henry! I love my car! If you are in the market for a new car I would highly recommend this dealership and if you can ask for Henry.< /Text>

Roberto was thorough, quick, and substantially added value to my day (and to my car). I prefer independent shops, but after working with Roberto, I will actually be going back to him in particular for future maintenance needs.

Give that man a raise because he just brought in a repeat customer!</text>< pics>

I'd buy or lease again without hesitation with Khalil, Adam Locke, and Peter Pan.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1617743710870, 'text': 'Anil- It means a great deal to us here at Peter Pan BMW that you were able to leave with a car that fit you.

Andy at Peter Pan BMW was great to work with.  He had the car prepared for us to test drive when we arrived.  When we decided to buy he quickly completed the financing app while sending the car to be detailed out.  Almost all documents were able to be signed electronically and we received a flash drive with all documents instead of a whole bunch of papers.  Great experience buying from Peter Pan BMW.</review>

We live in Monterey and received a fabulous online offer for the car we were looking for, so we made the two hour drive. J made the drive worth every minute by simplifying the purchase and staying late to complete the sale so we wouldn’t have to drive back another day. So many cars to choose from, screaming good deals, and relaxed and respectful sales professionals. The best car purchasing experience ever!< /review>

Great place to buy a BMW. Adam Locke helped me with my order in August and I picked up the car at the end of November. It couldn't have been an easier process. He even dropped the car off at my work. I also like how they offered me a great deal without too much back and forth, that was truly appreciated. Love the car too!<//Text>

I’m convinced these people laugh at everyone who walks through the door.  I bought a car last January. It took them 5 months to send me the money for my trade in. Next, they don’t even give you the key for your tires so if you have a flag you can’t even change your tire! I call a manager absolutely no help. He asks me if I looked in my car? Nah man, I just assumed I was screwed from the beginning. Last but not least, I finally got to put a new tire on the car and guess what? They discontinued the tire I had to put on it. So, I had to put 2 new tires on the car. This place is a scam and will do absolutely nothing to help you.</Text><pics>None< /pics><name>Mike Manus< /name>< Response>

From the moment we walked in, Henry Sipor gave us more than a 5 star service! He greeted us with a warm welcoming and was more than happy to help me find the PERFECT car. Me being fairly new to BMW i had very little knowledge and he made it clear to communicate with me every step of the way and even beat my expectations i thought I’d be getting. Furthermore, he made sure to dedicate all his time to myself and my family all while being an amazing employee to everyone else sourrounding! I would highly recommend him to anyone. Thank you for all your help, you hold a special place in our heart! I’m so happy with the car i now have and the friendship we’ve created! Happy New Years!</Review>

This was my first visit to Peter Pan BMW service after recently purchasing a used i3. The facility is clean, well-organized, and the staff are courteous and helpful. My service advisor kept me informed of the progress of the repairs and when I could pick my car up. I was given a loaner to use while my car was being repaired which was very helpful. I highly recommend.<//text>

We bought a pre-owned BMW using Costco car buying service. Working through Costco for a pre-owned car only helped a little. Would’ve made a much larger difference if we had been buying a new car. The sales personnel at Peter Pan especially Javed Ahmadzai,  were professional and helpful. We were very satisfied.<//review>

Your experience might be completely different with a different sales rep but for me this was the lowest effort customer service i’ve ever experienced at a car dealer, not to mention their appraisal for my trade in was almost half that of what i ended up selling for at a competing dealer.  Definitely not an experience on par with what a luxury dealer experience should be.< /Text>

<review>I have never had a better car buying experience. We worked with Khalil and Patrick who were increasingly accommodating considering we are in the middle of a pandemic. There were special precautions taken at each step and Khalil was extremely thorough, kind, and helpful throughout the whole process. A+++ for communication and cordiality! He went out of his way to accommodate our needs and helped us reach the best possible deal and outcome for the purchase. I don't think I will go anywhere else in the future for automobile purchases. We live in the East bay but it is worthwhile for us to go to Peter Pan BMW because of the trust established and the fantastic experience we had. We love our new car! Thank you, Peter Pan BMW, Khalil, and Patrick!<//review><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Super happy with my experience at Peter Pan. Doug went above and beyond to make sure I had all of the information I wanted and needed before making my first CPO purchase. Great communication and I have to give it to him for being extremely patient with me and all of my questions along the way. I left feeling confident about my vehicle purchase and the car itself was absolutely immaculate. Customer service here was unparalleled to any other dealership I’ve worked with before.</review>

I can tell every one of my friends that this guy is SUPER COOL! No B.S,. No multiple coffee breaks, super straight forward. He gives all the helpful information, took care of us and gave us a great deal.

Khalil is so friendly, he doesn’t have the typical arrogant attitude like many salesperson at luxury stores. We pick up the car the same day, K stayed late, help me install the license plate, and paired my phone. Great service!

If you are looking to purchase a BMW, look no further, call Khalil (we call him “K”), save time, save money and have a happy shopping experience.

P.S. A month after my purchase, I brought my friend and he purchase an X5. Same great experience. I highly recommend Khalil (K) and Peter Pan BMW!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1599012828766, 'text': "Thank you for the wonderful review!

<Review>My wife and I had an appointment with Mr. Khalil Manneh to test drive a used vehicle.  When we arrived we were professionally greeted and promptly allowed to test drive the vehicle.  I have to say,  by far this was the very best experience I ever had buying a car.  Khalil was friendly, knowledgeable, and put zero pressure on us to buy a car.  I’m happy to report we negotiated a great price and bought the car that same evening that we test drove the car.   The customer service at Peter Pan BMW was incredible, we had one minor issue with the car and it was addressed promptly.   I couldn’t be happier with our car and very thankful for the outstanding customer service and professionalism provided by Khalil and the Peter Pan BMW team.< /Review>< Pictures>

They helped me to swap a Lease which I was unhappy with whereas another dealer wouldn't even talk about it.

I recently had an experience with Peter Pan BMW located at El Camino Real. I bought my first car in the US at this branch location and the customer service provided by the salesperson “Adam Locke” at this branch was great. He was very involved with my purchase process at all the times. He clarified my questions, doubts, and the service he provided was excellent. I was in another branch locations and his attention and service definitively were above and beyond, which was basically the reason I decided to complete my purchase at this branch. Overall, the salesperson service was great.<//Text>

<text>This is our 3rd lease from Victor. If you go PeterPanBMW make sure to ask for Victor, he works very detailed gets you the deal you want. All staff is very nice and helpful (taking 2 toddlers to lease wasn't a good idea). I live in SF but I go PeterPan to lease because of the relationship Victor build in the last 7 years. Thank You, Victor and PeterPanBMW.</text>< resp>

<text>Eugene M. has been helping me lease BMWs since 2013. He always gets me the best deal by far. This time I was ready to lease a car that I wasn't "In-Love" with but my lease was expiring....Eugene M worked with me until he made the numbers work to get the car I really loved! This is why I've been driving to San Mateo to buy BMWs since 2013.</text>< pictures>

< review>
Our journey with Peter-Pan BMW started with contacting Adam Locke about our car needs and budget. From the get-go Adam was direct and honest. He helped us find a great BMW at a fantastic price. He understood our needs and during his day-off, asked his colleague - Khalil to show us the vehicle so that we don’t lose a good deal. The best thing about Adam was that no matter how much we haggled, no matter how many questions we asked, he addressed everything in a calm and patient manner. The entire process from buying the car to after-sales experience (its been more than 4 weeks now) has been nothing short of pleasant. We highly recommend Peter-Pan BMW and especially commend Adam for providing professional service. A big shout-out to Khalil as well who offered the test-drive and made us extremely comfortable with the vehicle - it only says that Peter-Pan BMW is a special dealership with awesome service.<//review>

The finance guy was very efficient and helpful as well. He processed all the documentation within 20 minutes to meet my schedule.
BTW, everything handled great during this time of COVID-19.<//text>< Pictures>

I've been a BMW owner since I got my License which was a very long time ago. Each time I've had some "awkward" or weird level of service at other BMW dealers. I heard raving reviews about Peter Pan BMW and I told myself that I will give it another try at Peter Pan BMW since they have the best reviews. I was beyond impressed by this dealer. I was taken care of from the moment my daughter and I walked in. I was greeted by Jim (nicest and most professional human being ever) He gave my daughter and the best greeting ever. Then he asked me detailed questions on what I was looking for and shared his thoughts with me. Since I had contacted this dealer ahead of time he had already had his homework done. He understood my concerns about staying within budget. I was impressed. Since at other dealers once you walk in you automatically become a target for the sales person next commission and they could care less what my needs are. At Peter Pan BMW it was such an incredible experience to know that they actually value me as a person. Then I was introduced to Javed the salesperson who was absolutely amazing. We went over our concerns in detail and he literally showed me 10 different scenarios to make sure that I am getting the best deal. He didn't try to pull a fast one one me like other BMW dealers always do! While we were going through my options and scenarios other members of the team (wish I could remember their names) introduced themselves  and they offered coloring books and other fun activities. I was so shocked. We even watched one of the salesperson granddaughters video which was so cute and it really touched our hearts. My daughter was so impressed now she wants to go there all the time now. As we were going through each of these details Jim was touching base with us each time to see if we were okay and if we needed anything. I personally saw that they were very busy, but they had made each of us customers feel like loyalty. I was able to select the 2020 BMW 530i Sedan  which is very beautiful and I know it fits my personality.  We also had the pleasure of meeting the Finance manager Shakeeb (Shack) he was just as professional and amazing to work with. He was very personable and easy to understand. I had expressed my concerns of being a single mother and how I needed to stay within my budget. He 100% understood me and shared that he had a beautiful daughter and understood my concerns as a parent. I like that Peter Pan BMW followed the covid guidelines which made me feel a little safer to be shopping for a car. The test drive was amazing and after a few lights I knew I wanted the car.  The car was ready and clean. What I want to highlight is that Jim is incredible. He was kind enough to get on a call with my brother (who works at another dealer) to go over my loan and the different scenarios that made sense for my budget. I was very grateful for this extra step. What I really love about Peter Pan BMW is that they didn't take advantage of me and the level of service was beyond measure. Can't wait till I go back when it's time to get a new car!  Heartfelt thanks for all their support and professionalism.  I also like that they respected me a person specially as woman. Since at other BMW's I would feel very violated or the salesperson would speak to me as I'm 2nd class citizen. Peter Pan BMW thank you for the outstanding level of service!! Also, I had 4 different dealers give me BS offers for my trade in value. Peter Pan BMW gave me the most amazing deal. I was even shocked myself. So beyond grateful!< /review>

TLDR: The sales people can be rude, only allow 5-10 minute test drives.

At first, the sales people at Peter Pan seemed very nice and accommodating. I scheduled an appointment for a test drive the day before, and we only waited a short time (10-15 min) for someone to see us. They were very friendly and gave us the keys and told us to take the car out - no further guidance.

We really enjoyed the test drive, it confirmed We liked the car and helped us learn which features were most important. We arrived back at the dealership about 30 minutes after driving off the lot. As soon as I entered, the salesman yelled from across the lobby that I almost got him fired before taking a call as I awkwardly stood there with the keys, and then continued to tell me that I had taken way too long. Apparently, test drives here should only last 5-10 minutes. I don’t think that is reasonable amount of time to figure out if you want to purchase a car. We were going to test out some other models, but the salesman kept harping on how we had almost gotten him fired and took way too long (despite being given absolutely no guidance beforehand). We decided it was not a good setting to make a major purchase and promptly left. I would look elsewhere before coming to this dealership.<//review>

Beautiful car. Nice and easy way to shop. Internet manager Patrick Castano handled everything quickly and easily.  I went through Costco pricing and had vehicle selected and pricing confirmed before I arrived. Patrick answered all my questions via phone and text just as I preferred.. Very good experience.< /review>

Henry is an all-star salesperson - as in, an absolute delight to work with. Honest, straight-forward, thoughtful, and fun - Henry went above-and-beyond at every step of the way to help me find a great deal and to make sure I got the right car for my needs, whether it was helping research accessories or texting answers to questions well after business hours. A zillion questions patiently answered via text and phone call later, he even helped me ask the ones I didn't know I ought to. Wild to write a review about a salesperson who had my best interest in mind - but that's Henry. Put your next car purchase in his hands and you won't be disappointed!<//Review>

<text>Had a surprisingly bad experience today as normally service is excellent and trustworthy. Took my 2004 325i in for an airbag recall which was promoted as a Recall Service Event.  Along with this service, they also performed a courtesy inspection and a free car wash.  However, after I picked up my 325i today, I had a *significant* driveability issue and I had to pull off the road and stop the car.  Numerous calls late in the afternoon on Friday went unanswered after being transferred from an operator - one at 5:45 PM even told me that folks had gone home for the day.  After a 5th call,  I was able to speak to someone but the issue was not resolved to my satisfaction and the car remains undriveable.  Perhaps the review trends shown in Yelp in 2020 are accurate and reflect a declining level of service at this dealership - as ratings appear lower than in previous years.  That's too bad as I have another newer 528i which  I'll have to find a new service department to trust.<//text>< Gmap_id>

While most people dislike shopping for a new car I accept it as a challenge. I have had both good and bad experiences over the years. As this was the first BMW I have purchased I wanted to make sure that I did adequate research and visited six dealerships. My final selection was with Adam L. and Doug M. of Peter Pan BMW. They earned my trust and my business.
--Honest, straightforward assistance from day one.
--Kept me informed of special promotions and the logistics of delivery (car was special ordered from Munich).
--When I had questions, they were answered promptly. I was also introduced to a number of different BMW Product 	Genius Assistants for technical advice.
--No high-pressure sales effort. Very cordial and professional communications throughout the transaction.
--Very satisfied with my price and the entire purchase and delivery process.
--Have already referred friends to Peter Pan because of the superior treatment I received.< /text>

<text>Great staff and best dealer I've been to so far.

I worked with Javed and Shakeeb to buy a CPO BWM car. They are great, patient and super helpful. They don't judge you or talk you into things you don't really need. It took us a whole day there to finish all the documents and  signs. They help us with everything we need, answer questions of first buyers. They build a good brand impression on us, I will definitely consider BMW again when I need to buy another car or lease a car.

Also want to mention the front desk is helpful!</text><Gmap_id>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a< /Gmap_id></record>

An oil change was overdue and since my 2017 330x sport wagon was coming up on 4yr, I had the diagnostic done too. When the car was returned, I got a new ding and scratch on the rear lift door. The ding looks like the door was hit with a pointed object.  Fortunately, my service representative took full responsibility and the car is now scheduled to be repaired at their affiliated body shop next week- along with a loaner. Thats why I only gave 4 stars.  As background, I've owned BMWs since 1984 and had several cars serviced by Peter Pan over the yrs and never had any body damage.</Text>

<UserId.>102667470240553143281<//UserId.><review>I was promised a price for a BMW X4 and the next day, after I had gone through the trouble of finding a buyer for my old car and planning an 800 mile drive to Seattle (from California), I was told by the general manager of Peter Pan BMW that they are not going to honor their promised price. They said their sales representative hadn't confirm the price with the manager before promising it to me (as a client, I don't think I need to know that).

In case you are curious, the reason why we didn't close the deal the previous day was that we needed time to arrange for the delivery of the car to Seattle and to make sure that they could do that on the timeline at which we needed the car. The sales agent prepared all the paper work for the deal that we had agreed on and everything was ready for me to sign the next day.

Long story short, I ended up having to pay $2000 higher than their promised price to get the car, which, at that point, I had to do to avoid a full collapse of all my subsequent plans (with the sales of my old car and my trip to Seattle coming up). The general manager literally told me that they don't care what the client (i.e. I) was told the day before. He continued, if I had sigend the documents the night before he would have kept the lower price [read: wouldn't have been ABLE to change it to the higher price] but now he was not going to honor their own word.

That all said, the sales people were very helpful and considerate (I wish I could leave a separate rating for that). I think I got the manager on his bad day, but I expect a general manager of a big (and otherwise reputable) corporate like BMW not to pass the ongoing internal frictions and conflicts on to their clients.

I thought this was the end of the drama with the Peter Pan BMW and was glad that I didn't have to go back there again after I leave the lot ... But I was up for a big surprise!

At the noon of Oct 24th, I sold my old vehicle right outside of this dealership to buy the car from the Peter Pan BMW that I had sigend some of the documents for already (including the price breakdown agreement). As I was signijg the rest of the documents the manager came up and summoned the sales representative who was helping me sign the documents ... A few minutes later I was told that they were not going to sell the car to me because they had realized that I had left this review for them (I had posted the sections above this paragraph on Yelp the prior evening). This was utterly upsetting, but I will try to be professional an just write what I observed as opposed to how I feel.

Reading this whole note again, it is possible that the manager's ego couldn't handle the part that I said "[he] wouldn't have been ABLE to [cancel the sale if I had signed the documents]". So, CAUTION!! If, despite my experience, you decide to do business with this dealership make sure you understand that the managerial team here may have a delicate ego and, evidently, this is how they treat customers that they make unhappy, just to protect their delicate egos.< /review>< Time>

I returned to this dealer because I received excellent support and service for my last car, a 650i convertible. The buying experience was exceptional. The sales person, Adam Locke, was very knowledgeable and professional. He was very responsive to questions and requests. The administrative person who handled the closing documents was also very professional. The 840i handles even difficult road conditions very well and the safety and driver assistance features are truly state-of-the-art.< /review>< username>

Shoutout to Peter Pan BMW. I loved my experience here and the process was quick. I went for a certified preowned 2017 BMW X3. This was my first car purchase and I never could have dreamed that I would be able to afford a BMW at such an incredible value. the Internet Sales Manager is Doug Miller. He is a very professional individual and puts great attention to detail on the quality of the car and care for his customers. There was great inspection done, providing new equipment and fine detailing to prepare the car. The sales and finance people are not pushy at all. They are good humans who hold high integrity and professionalism for the brand and their customers. I hope my X3 will last me many years and I look forward to working with Doug and his team one day in the future again.</Review>

<text>If you are looking to purchase a BMW in the Bay Area, I recommend Peter Pan BMW. New to the BMW brand and planning to special order a new 3 series, I was helped by Javed Ahmadzai. Javed was friendly, efficient, concise, and most importantly not pushy during the buying process. In anticipation to receive delivery of my new car, he told me about the BMW Connected App/My Garage to track my special order. The tracker was a nifty resource as you can check on the status of your vehicle from the start to finish (Think Domino’s Pizza tracker, except it’s for your BMW).

When my car was finally delivered to Peter Pan, Javed smoothly sorted out all of the paper work, while Tom at finance gave an efficient, concise and no pressure rundown of the warranty options. Once all the paper work and payment was finalized, Javed oriented my family and I about the car and took his time to to answer all our questions.

As a first time buyer of BMW, Peter Pan BMW made a great first impression to represent one of the best car brands in the world.< /text>< Pics>

Khalil was AWESOME!! My husband & I went in not knowing if we wanted to purchase or lease. He was kind, funny, & very patient as we had a ton of questions. We took up a lot of his time & not once did we feel pressured to buy. He worked with us until we found just the right car while keeping us within our budget! This isn’t my first purchase with BMW, and honestly, no comparison to the service we received at Peter Pan BMW! They really take care of you! Thank you to Khalil, Peter, & Shak!

Youbert the floor manager made the whole test driving experience very unpleasant. The way he spoke and the comments he made was unprofessional. He made us feel like we were not worth his time. One of our friend that was with us had to walk away because he couldn't stand his demeanor.

We were looking for a specific model for our next dream car. However, he did not want to let us test drive at the beginning. Making excuses stating all those models were manual. Okay, that's not what your website inventory says. Then, he says you can sit in the passenger side and get the feel of the car while I drive it. 🤔 okay, am I going to have you drive the car around for me if I purchase the car?
Well, after finding out what we do for a living, then he decided to let us test drive the car.

Thanks but no thanks. Since this experience was so unpleasant, it had sucked out the fun of the car. We had decided to spend more money on a much better and faster car. Good luck. Next time don't judge a book by its cover.< /Text>

< review>
I leased a new BMW from Peter Pan BMW.  Peter Galanakis is the advisor who helped me.  My experience working with Peter and the other folks at Peter Pan BMW was excellent.  Peter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in, and he helped make my leasing experience truly easy.  Peter was patient in letting me make my decision without being “pushy” (like some car salespeople sometimes can be).  He seemed truly interested in helping me find the vehicle that was right for me, and not just to make a sale.  I truly appreciate his assistance, and would highly recommend Peter, and the folks at Peter Pan BMW, to anyone looking for a BMW!  I will definitely return to Peter (if he is still with Peter Pan BMW) when my lease is over.<//review>

<text>This was my first experience at Peter Pan BMW and as a long time BMW customer, I was incredibly impressed with this dealership. Rob Renson was fantastic as he provided on-going support throughout my day, connecting me with fantastic professionals and ensuring my experience was focused on my needs. Doug Miller was simply awesome - a true professional. He took the time to discuss my needs, preferences and how I like to review options. He spent the time to run through multiple scenarios and put together a great deal. I can’t say enough how refreshing it was to work with a sales person who really listened and delivered complete client-oriented service. Plus the support staff, (Johnny in Finance and Yuri in Genius) were amazing. The whole experience exceeded my expectations and I’m a committed client?</text>< Rating>

I’ve just bought my second car from Henry Sipor at Peter Pan BMW. As with every time I deal with Henry, and BMW, it was a pleasure. Henry is professional and makes me feel like he’s really working for me. He takes as much time as I need to get me what I want. I’ll never buy a car anywhere else, or with anyone else. Not everyone can say that buying a car is a  pleasure, but with Henry, and both Peter Pan sales, and service, it really is.</review>

<review>Buying a car experience was far far beyond my expectations.
My manger was Eugene Masalitin and thanks to his great professional skills I've got my CPO BMW X1 in just a 2.5 hours from entering the dealership till leaving it behind-the-wheel of my first BMW car!
I'm more than satisfied with the price I've got for the car as well as the maintenance options.
Already recommended friend to buy BMW in Peter Pan.
Thank you guys for great help :)</review></record></dataset><record>

<time>1588825480513< /time><Text>TLDR; sales service was rude as hell

Victor made it very clear from the first second that he wanted nothing to do with me. I initially called to ask if a car on their website was still available - he sounded annoyed that I would bother to verify. I knew exactly what car I wanted, so I went down to the dealership just to make sure it was visually alright. The second I walked into his office he made it clear that I was wasting his time. He literally threw a fit when I told him I don't have insurance (I currently don't own a car) and that it was such a burden to ride along with me. Once in the car I asked him very basic questions and he knew absolutely nothing about it. When I realized it didn't have the features I was looking for (my mistake not reading the full description online), he said there were too many cars for him to know what was on the lot. Victor, I told you I was buying an X1. There were literally 5 pre-owned X1s on the lot. Not a lot to juggle. When we got back from the drive I mentioned that other dealerships had the same car with the features I wanted for the same price - he vaguely waved at the lot and walked back into the building.

The funny thing is I convinced my partner to buy his X3 here a few months earlier. Guess I wasn't worth a second sale.< /Text>< Resp>

After a long and exhaustive search, my wife and I finally located an X5 that had just about all of the options we had been looking for.  As usual, I sent an email to the dealership requesting a quote and more information, but this time the experience was different (in a very positive way!).  Doug was quick to respond to my inquiry, and after a very short phone call late in the evening (he was on his way out the door and still took my call), we had a lease price and terms that met and exceeded our expectations.  Since we live in the Modesto area, I needed some reassurance that the information Doug provided was all encompassing and that the car would be held so that we could make a trip over there the following day to check everything out and finalize the deal.  With a very friendly and inviting tone, he assured me that it was all good, and this made me feel much more comfortable.  I could tell right then that Doug was no ordinary salesperson just looking to make a sale, but he was actually trying to make our experience an effort-free one.  Once we got to the dealership the next day, we met Doug and he started a process with us that I have to admit was the most enjoyable and smooth car leasing experience that I ever had!  We absolutely love our new X5, and after not owning or leasing a BMW in the past, we are now proud members of the BMW family and plan to be for years to come!  Thanks again, Doug, for your outstanding customer service, as well as all of the wonderful staff at Peter Pan BMW for making our day!</Text>

< review>
Just got my 330 from Peter Pan BMW today. Worked with Doug Miller and he managed to get exactly the car that I want (Thank you, Doug!) The lease process is fast and smooth. Doug is very patient at answering all my questions and in a very clear way. Peter helped me set up the car and he’s very knowledgeable and patient. Highly recommend Peter Pan and look for Doug! If you live in South Bay, be sure to check out Peter Pan also, it’s not that far and has far better experience!<//review>

Had the best car leasing experience possible. Adam L. in  the sales dept made the process simple and easy. He is an honest and decent sales person, which is a challenge to find.  We checked every BMW dealership in the Bay Area and Sacramento and found that the deal at Peter Pan was by far much better than any other dealership. We arrived almost at closing time to get the car so the dealership stayed open later for us to wash the car, complete paperwork, and teach me some of the cool gadgets on my beemer. I have leased and owned many cars and am probably one of the most pickiest people to work with when it comes getting a deal. I know the deal I received was great and I have never been happier with a leasing experience. I will be calling Adam at Peter Pan for sure to get me another BMW when this lease is up.< /Text>

< Review>
We called and asked if we need an appointment and were told to just walk in. Upon walking in we waited 30 minutes to speak to a sales person and stated our intention to happily buy a new BMW. However the sales person Jay was not helpful. It took him another 20 minutes to show us cars we are interested in and was unable to help us with a test drive as they “couldn’t find the car”. We waited another 45 minutes before leaving, and discovered that Jay was juggling other customers in the meantime.< /Review>

This is a rating for the General Manager Jim and his horrifying business practices that endanger children's lives during COVID:

We were called by this location and asked when we would like to bring in our car for it's maintenance of an oil change during COVID, we asked if we could push off given our daughter has epilepsy. The sales men said it would void our warranty - note this sales men can see our lease mileage. We decided to risk it as they called again, and made plans all around safety. When we arrived they said our car was no longer under warranty and they wanted to charge us $650. They also took 0 responsibility for the bait and switch, and said they don't know who called. We talked to the General Manager of the Dealership: Jim and the General Manager of the Service Dept: Bob to make this right, and they didn't and were extremely unprofessional. During the drop off the Service folks let us know they weren't getting any business, so this was a push by them and they know it (Marketing 101). I hope they can live with themselves that they decided to pressure us into bringing our car in, so they can make a few hundred dollars while risking our daughters life. Awesome work.</text>

What the... Is that supposed to be 'value add'? I dropped off my car on Friday morning for a recall service. At the service desk they asked my permission to wash it. I said, "Well, it's a soft top, you cannot put it through a machine... Anyway, I just washed it the night before last." The clerk said "Ok, I'll make a note to hand wash it." I picked up my car Saturday morning, and it looks like someone mopped the garage floor and poured the bucket of dirty water over the car. The windows are all streaked, inside and out, and the rims have never looked that filthy since I've owned the car. I hope the mechanic took better care of my vehicle than the person who washed it! I can't accurately rate this service visit. I'll have to wait to see if parts start falling off. Thanks for the doughnuts. :(< /review>

Fantastic service, the easiest car lease ever. Adam Locke was knowledgable and informative and what's usually an excruciating process went quickly and smoothly. I got a wonderful deal on a beautiful car!</text>

Great service.  Can’t thank Peter Pan for their customer service and pick up and drop off service.  Peter Pan definitely stepped up during these unsettling times

Thank you Peter Pan 🙏🏻<//Text>

<review>As I was driving on 280 south today 5/5 at 11.10am near South San Francisco, a black bmw attempted to force insert in front of me from one of the ramps (I was on the further right lane). The driver was driving fast and then continued driving recklessly, changing multiple lanes at a time and tailgating other cars. It was obvious that his driving was unsafe. All of that with a peterpanbmw.com sticker on the back window. If that’s how you treat your cars, then I will never purchase from you. I hope this review helps other people as well.<//review>< Pictures>

The service at Peter Pan BMW goes above and beyond expectations!
They are very accommodating to individual needs and provided me with a beautiful BMW 2020 coupe loaner while servicing my car- I highly recommend this service center to any BMW owner!</Text>

<name>James J Bennington<//name><Date>1590010664443<//Date><Rate>4<//Rate><review>Ken did a nice job assisting me. The cost of repairs estimate and specific work needed is very valuable.

The cost of a peter pan mechanic is beyond my budget. So I an taking my older bmw to a german repair shop with the info they require from peter pan bmw mechanic's assesment.

The two hundred dollar diagnostic is a valuable service to invest in.

I think the shop I am going to is a good one for an older car. But a look from bmw mechanic is a good idea first.

Have always had decent service at peter pan.</review>< Pictures>

Service | Roberto was an absolute 10. He was honest, quick to find pertinent information, and extremely respectful of my time and money! He surely exceeded my expectations...Roberto informed me as the progress of the extended warranty issue was fixed!  I was honestly surprised at how well, and often, he communicated w/ both myself and my wife (compared to other service depts.)

Thank you Roberto for the killer service...we really appreciate it!  The ladies at the front desk were awesome. Super helpful, nice, and fun to hang out with when I waited for my shuttle home!

...on the front end I wish, via the phone, I was provided some more upfront info regarding, what seemed to me, a very well known warranty issue. I provided my year/make/model & vin but no information was provided and I was faced w risking $200 in diagnostics even though I was almost certain it was going to be covered!

Overall we are very appreciative of how our Peter Pan BMW service visit went!

I always enjoy coming to his location. They've always provided me with great service and have treated me very well, both for the repairs to my car and for the pre-post customer experience such as providing me rides to my work after I drop off my car and picking me up when I'm coming to pick up my car, providing a complimentary car wash, and overall timely communication during my repairs so I'm aware of what's happening. Only docking one star due to an issue with my most recent repair job where I was repeatedly informed it was the passenger side airbag was the one that needed repairs instead of the driver's side airbag, which to me makes a big difference.< /review>

I am new to CA and needed to do something with an existing BMW lease.  I was familiar with Peter Pan BMW via service so thought I would start with them.  Patrick Castano worked with me and did a phenomenal job.   I equate buying cars with things like the DMV and the dentist but this was a great experience and I would work with Patrick and this dealership again.<//review>

Timely and friendly service! I got a flat tire on my M3 and drove in with no appointment in advance. The service team attended to my issue immediately. The service advisor, Gus, did a quick exam of my car, advised me of the condition and provided repair options. I like the fact that Gus gave me options to consider such that I could pick one which fit my needs and budget. Gus also did a great job keeping me informed of the status of the work and helped arrange for the shuttle ride.</Text>

My first car buying experience was made great by Jay (Jae?). He worked hard to get the price we asked for, and though it wasn't perfect he was still able to get us a small discount. My test drive was with another guy, who seemed very uninterested by the sale and it felt like our time was waisted as he wouldn't even take our offer into consideration. So I took a star off for that. On a whole the dealership is clean and modern. Plenty of coffee and goodies while you wait. Thanks again Jay!<//Review>

<user_name>Massoud Navab< /user_name><Rating>5</Rating><review>In just one visit Iuliiia Adamovich helped me trade in my old car and drive away in my new 2019 330i. I love it. I can't stop bragging about it.
I had a 328d and I thought I could never get anything better. 328d mpg far exceeds what the manufacturer advertises. And still 2019 330i has gone further.

Iuliia helped me with trade in, selection and finances, plus the few follow up questions that I had in the following weeks.
Very Happy.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I did extensive research and shopped around various Bay area BMW dealerships. This included test driving at each, sitting with finance and negotiating the numbers including  optional packages. PP was professional, no pressure, and transparent. I worked specifically w Iulia who was a blessing given the experiences at the other dealers. She was transparent, accomodating, and an easy sales person to work with. Thanks Iulia !<//Text>

<Review>It can be a worrisome and stressful process when you and/or your vehicle are involved in an accident. It makes a huge difference when you feel taken care of by the service professionals. Oliver is that person who took care of us and our car during this time. He is an extremely courteous professional who is very knowledgeable, quick, and reliable. He’ll keep in good communication with you throughout. His professionalism helps ease the innate stress surrounding a situation like this, and as a car owner that is greatly appreciated.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I already have my new BMW 330e for a month, and it's such an excellent experience working with Adam Locke before and after I bought the car. I was recommended by friend to lease a new car from Adam, and he did give me the best deals without wasting time to negotiate back and forth. I contacted Adam on Saturday night of Labor Day and the next day I drove a brand new car out of Peter Pan within an hour after I got there. Even though this is my first time leasing a car, he made the whole leasing process very smooth and straight forward. I am so glad that I leased the car with Adam at Peter Pan BMW, if you are looking for a BMW, don't hesitate to contact Adam Locke at Peter Pan, you deserve to get the best.< /Review>

We custom-ordered an X1 and picked it up yesterday.  Neither my wife nor I had a lot of time, and we arrived late for the agreed pickup time.  And the DMV paperwork etc. is tedious.  And, Peter Pan just had changed over from paper-based processing to a fancy new electronic system.  All combined that's a recipe for a good experience.  However, at the end we were very positively surprised.  There was a little hiccup initially, but after intervention the process went very smoothly indeed, and the slight delay we perceived was entirely excusable in the light of the courteous, fast, efficient, and gracious service we received.</Text>

I was in search of replacing my 428i lease and upgrading to a 440i purchase. Found the exact vehicle through Peter Pan BMW. Although our travel distance was 100+ miles, it was well worth it. Peter Wan was exceptional to work with and personable. We ran into a snag with pricing. Fortunately the manager was willing to work with us or offer the original quoted price. Recommend Peter Wan as he is to the point and kind without the grueling salesman mentality. We love our 440! Thank you Peter Wan, Adam and hilarious Shak in finance.</text>

<Review>This is an initial review since I only recently have been coming here. Tom at the Parts counter is great, he's really helpful and knows his stuff. I have returned like 6 or more times for parts since I like to service my own BMW.

As for the service department, I've only had my car in there once. My car went into limp mode for a leaky injector. I towed it to Peter Pan and they replaced all 4 as well as the spark plugs but it cost me $2000.  The labor was only $500, so I can't complain too much. I just wish I researched the repair myself first because I might have gotten away with cleaning them and replacing the seals. Oh well, they still did an awesome job<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1558814816524, 'text': "Karl,\n\nWe appreciate your feedback for our team and the quality of our services.

Car is good but the service is not that good. Spending 80% time on waiting. Also, I scheduled the test drive two times with the sales but they didn't get the car ready for both two times and I didn't get a chance to test that car when I arrive. Finally I chose another car from peter pan but I have to say the experience is not as good as I expected.</review>

He was very attentive and knowledgeable which made the purchasing experience less tense (not my favorite thing to do by far). In addition to Henry, I worked with Shak to finalize the financing. He was also very enjoyable and easy to work with. I ended up with a great rate and an overall great experience! Thanks Henry and Shak and Peter Pan BMW.

< Review>
Been to a few BMW dealership in the area but I feel if I had started from here I would have not gone anywhere else.  In size they are smaller because of which their on-site inventory is smaller but they makeup for it in service.  They don't have a service center here so their focus is selling and I felt their level of service perhaps for that matter was better.  Did have issues taking on time delivery which they recognized and accommodated for on their own well.<//Review>

< review>
The whole process of leasing my new BMW i3 was seamless from start to finish. I found Henry Sipor the ultimate fleet manager, to be immensely helpful, courteous and professional in finding a new version of the i3 in the color/trim/options I was looking for. As a return customer for Peter Pan BMW, my standards were high, and I was not disappointed in any part of the transaction. Having previously leased a BMW 328i and then the electric i3, and am now back to replace the i3 with the newer version that has a longer range, I am certain to return again. Henry worked very hard to identify the car I was looking for and let me know as soon as the vehicle was arriving while getting me an amazing deal. I came into the showroom, examined the gorgeous car, made a decision right away. Very soon I was driving home with a big smile on my face in my new i3. Thank you very much Henry for your professionalism and I shall return again.</review>

My Peter Pan experience was excellent.  Two cars ordered.
Adam Lock is very professional and knowledgeable.
Adam arranged and organized my purchases from pricing to ordering to delivery.  He went the extra step on everything.
All went smoothly.  We used the Costco program and BMW incentives for pricing.
I would highly recommend Adam and Peter Pan to potential car buyers.</Text>

Adam Locke helped me lease a 2017 i3.  It was the fastest and most pleasant leasing experience I've had.  This is my 4th lease but my first with Peter Pan.  Adam's service and positive attitude beat all the others.  If I had made up my mind about the features, it would have taken less than 1 hour.  How's that for speed?  He took care of everything from start to finish.  Adam even helped the Finance Manager.  She was also very delightful to work with.  I recommend you give your business to Adam.  He's the best!< /Text>

I would highly recommend Javed Ahmadzai to anyone looking for a BMW. He is extremely sincere, honest, and his willingness to go above and beyond to find the right car for me definitely exceeded my expectation. Javed will be my only point of contact on all future purchases for me, my friends and families. Thank you for making my car buying experience so pleasant.</Review>

Gus was very responsive to my urgent call and made himself available right when I showed up with no appointment to help me with my car. I was impressed of how he handled the situation, including getting me a loaner car and taking a thorough look at me car to investigate the matter. In the next day he called with both a solution and a very reasonable quote. One that I can afford and have it fixed right away. By the following day I hade my car back all fixed and ready to go. thank you Gus!!! much appreciated the service and the due care.<//Text>

The strangest experience I've ever had at a car dealership. Sales professional did not care about solving our needs or earning our business, which was confusing and insulting. We came in looking to test drive and possibly buy, given the recent positive Google reviews, but will instead be buying elsewhere.</Text>

Peter Pan BMW by far was my best dealership experience.  I have owned and leased a dozen cars and by far this was most enjoyable I ended up buying two new vehicles in the same night only interested in the one.  Rob Taylor sales rep was a huge part of the overall experience.  His knowledge and structure of the deal made was done with my best interest in mind.  He guided and asked the right questions to find me what I was looking for.  Turned out that my second car was better to get out of and get into a 2nd BMW.  I did a double deal and it was the fastest process I have ever seen. The information was entered electronically and sent to finance manager.  While waiting the lobby had tv, comfortable seating lounge, complimentary water and coffee.  The vending machines were loaded with great snack and was able to use my Apple Watch with Apple Pay to get snacks from the machine.  Once inside the finance the digital desk with LED screen built in was impressive.  Start to finish was 10-15 minutes.  It was super fast and all electronic.  He handed me a thumb drive usb and said congrats you own two BMW’s.  All your contract files are added to a thumb drive making it very green and efficient. Rob Taylor again put our temp plates on had it pulled up from detail to the front and walked us through some features of X7 and 330i. We couldn’t have picked a better place to buy.  We came from the Northbay but it was well worth it.   They have a great deal of inventory which made finding something we really wanted easy.

I moved to the Bay Area from NY and was afraid I would get different treatment since I didn’t purchase my vehicle at Peter Pan, but that wasn’t the case at all.

All paperwork was done pretty quick even though they were so busy.

Kahlil Manneh, Sales Manager at Peter Pan BMW made us feel welcome ---professional and knowledgeable about the BMW 435i we purchased.  The whole experience including the financing and explanation of all the sport features that were an improvement on the 328i we previously purchased from Peter Pan was very reassuring.  Really appreciate the stress free experience.</Review>

I haven't been working in the United States for long and don't have a stellar credit history. So I walked into the dealership expecting to be dismissed quickly like I had been the day before in another BMW dealership. I was pleasantly surprised when Adam Locke greeted me warmly, patiently answered all my questions and provided information of several different cars that I was interested in, both leasing and buying. Throughout the whole process he was polite, knowledgeable, and professional. Coco, the financial manager, was also extremely helpful in helping me figuring out the best way to work with my limited credit history. I drove home that day a satisfied customer, in a new 2 series convertible.

Bottom line: I would recommend this dealership to anyone who's interested in a BMW.<//text>

<review>I just leased my new BMW I3 at this PeterPan location. The dealership is not huge which helps a lot. You get personal service. I got a great lease deal for 3 years. Sergio Castro was of great help. In addition, one of their BMW genius techs Ed Chow helped me setup all the options in the car and answered tons of questions I had on every little detail. The full technology package is very nice. Overall, very satisfied.<//review>< pics>

I actually called to inquire if Peter Pan had in stock a certain color and options package available on the 3i.  Victor Hong (Rockstar salesperson) had the car, knew exactly what I was looking for, went over all the options, financing (lease) patiently waited while I called my insurance representative to fax over proof of insurance so I could take advantage of a loyalty program (BMW) Meanwhile, car was cleaned, waxed and charged ready to go. Super easy, stress free and FUN experience. Thank you Victor Hong....again!!< /text>

<review>I never leave a negative review for bmw service stores. But I have to report this store. The service is really unprofessional. They didn’t really hear customer needs but just keep charging me. Also I forgot  my wallet in the car being served there but when I got back my car. My wallet is gone! I asked them, they simply tell me that they are not responsible for anything valuable even without helping to ask around.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

<Review>So I pursued one BMW at Peter Pan San Mateo and was all fine but after I get the car I received multiples tickets about expired registration because on the BMW they don’t print the temporary registration and put on my car! And now they are making me pay all those tickets because they say the police officers was wrong in give me tickets for expired registration they are arrogant and said the I do not understand about law and if I want to get money from BMW for I go forward and suit them is this all being an nightmare!<//Review>< Response>

I first came to Peter Pan bmw 3 years ago and was very happy with my experience with Henry Sipor and my 328i lease. I recently renewed my lease and was even more impressed with Henry. He’s always looking out for you and willing to tell you how it is. In my opinion, that’s all you can ask for in a sales rep: to be honest and to help you get what you want. Period.

I knew i had gone over my lease mileage but with his help i was still able to secure the car i wanted without overpaying. Love my new BMW. Thanks Henry!<//Text>

<Review>Last month I was planning to trade my car(2017 Toyota Camry) to a pre-owned BMW 3 series, so I decided to go directly to Peter Pan BMW and check the cars they had, I met Javed Ahmadzai there he showed me few 3 series, I took almost 2 weeks to decide if I wanted to go ahead with the deal as I was not able to make up my mind, thanks to Javed Ahmadzai he was patient enough and gave me my time to decide about the car, After 2 weeks I decided to buy the new 2019 330i and Javed gave the best deal he could and finally I got my new car, Javed is knowledgeable and easy to work with! He helped me find the perfect new Car with all the options needed at the best price.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a< /GmapID></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The dealership was very professional and responsive to my needs. Even though only there were no appointments available until later in the week, because of the oil leak, I wanted the dealership to accommodate me sooner rather than later. They were not only able to accommodate me virtually the next day but when the repairs took longer than anticipated, they even arrange a loaner car for me. The service adviser kept me appraised at every step of the way. Very good service overall and very satisfied.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
I worked with Adam Locke at Peter Pan BMW in San Mateo, and he was the best salesperson I've ever bought a car from.  I bought a CPO i3 from him a few weeks ago for a great price. A couple days after I bought the car, I got concerned because I discovered a few issues with the car. Adam worked with me to schedule a time to come in, pickup a loaner while they took a look at it. Without getting in to too much detail, Adam did the right thing and took great care of me by fixing the issues. The car looks/feels/drives like it's brand new.  Picking up the loaner and dropping it off took 2 minutes.

I cannot recommend Adam or Peter Pan BMW enough. Thank you!< /review>

Peter Pan BMW has competitive pricing and excellent customer service.  Doug Miller helped us with our pre-owned purchase and patiently explained the pros and cons of buying pre-owned vs leasing new.  He also helped to make sure the vehicle was delivered in sparkling new condition. Yuri was our product specialist and he knew his BMWs inside and out.  They make an outstanding team, and at no time did we feel pressured to buy. Just friendly, helpful service. We will be referring ou friends and family to them.</Text>

This review is mainly for the sales department and the salesman Doug Miller.  When I walked in, I already had my preconceived notions of pushy car salesmen and simply getting the "shorter end of the stick".  This, however, was not the case with Doug.  I went to Peter Pan having done a fair amount of research for the best deals on a certified pre-owned (cpo) X5.  Doug was more than patient and accommodating with my inquiries.  I left for that day with numbers, prices, and inventory to think about and to do more research and he gladly agreed to meet with me for any outstanding questions I might have had.  I was able to set up an appointment with him in 2 days and it was on that day that I had made my purchase for a cpo X5.  Because of Doug, I felt confident in my purchase and would recommend him to anyone looking for the best and honest deal from Peter Pan.
I took away one star because there was only one car key when I was promised 2 keys.  It took 1 month to get the 2nd key and then about a week to program it.
Aside from that, my experience at Peter Pan BMW  was first-class and I recommend asking for Doug Miller if you have the chance.</text>

<Review>I drove up to PP BMW hot, sweaty & frazzled because of a light that came on and made my air conditioner cease to work.(100 degrees)
Steve greeted me immediately, put my mind at rest and even taught me a few things about my car that I did not know, the guys inside were equally as competent, they had me in & out of there in 20 minutes with a brand new BMW loaner, everything wrong with my car was under warranty 🙌🏼😊. I highly recommend this service department.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>My review is specifically about my awesome sales people Adam and Jay.  They were kind, friendly, responsive, reasonable, and all around great people.  Adam took time out from his vacation to make sure that I got my car - texting back and forth with me on his day off to ensure that my customer experience was amazing.  Jay took me on a drive during rush hour and detailed all the distinguishing features of the model I was buying - again, a really pleasant experience.  It's true that technically, you purchase a car from a company, but ultimately, it's the actual person that sells you the car that makes or breaks your experience.  I lucked out by having Adam and Jay as my sales people.  Very good experience.< /Text>< Pictures>

Fantastic place, great customer service!”
This dealership was top notch! Henry Sipor went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the car I was most comfortable with. He gave me suggestions and his advice, but was in no way pushy what-so-ever. After I decided on a vehicle the process was absolutely painless. So quick and professional. I felt like family by the end of the whole process! I would recommend Henry Sipor to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.</Text>

At first i was reluctant to bring my car to any BMW service because of the prices  but i have no choice because it needs BMW certified mechanic to replace my steering column and program the car. The experience was more than EXCELLENT!! Kudos to Roberto Ronquillo for his outstanding knowledgeable great service. He made me feel comfortable, appreciated and made sure i get taken care of by providing me a loaner car, he made my day! I will definitely recommend Peter Pan BMW Service to my friends and colleagues. Thank you for a great service!!</Text>

Arrogant sales team that treats you like you're lucky to be in their building. The salesman was unbearable. I purchased a car anyway, and accidentally left about $200 in items in my trade-in. I called later that day and was assured he would hold the items for me. When I called the next day to set a time to come in and retrieve the items, my salesman told me the car (and items) was already gone, and proceeded to berate me for leaving the items in the car to begin with. I was so upset I called his manager, got his message machine, and left a detailed message explaining what had happened, but he never bothered to return my call. These people are absolutely AWFUL at customer service, and it clearly comes from the top on down. That was the last BMW I've purchased.<//text>

<name>Mark lu</name><time>1566942516625<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>During first meet, the service rep that’s “helping” me to get my boss’s i3 serviced outright refused to provide me with a loaner car and blamed it on some divine power that’s beyond him (some les he didn’t even name and blamed on). First try, ok I get it, “the owner of the vehicle has to be present”. Second time when I called the loaner car service again about it, the loaner department passed me to the same person again, and like the BOSS he is that seemed to control all service department, told me flat no again because my boss has a international driver’s license. Then, when I asked if there’s another other way, he put me on hold for about less than a minute, and then told me flat NO again! Well, hello, how did my boss got a car at Peter Pan the first place? And is legally driving in the state of California with his seemingly “non-legitimate” international driver’s license?

When you work in the service sector, the worst thing you can do is tell your customer, or person directly related to your customer a big “NO”. That’s the end of my fuss and I now have a bad taste with Peter Pan BMW. With that been said, I personally would not and also, would not recommend anyone I know to get their bmw serviced here.

Update:
I had talked with individual, and understood that it's solely his company's policy. I feel bad singling him out, when instead it's only Peter Pan I need to be venting on.</text>< Pics>

Oliver is awesome!  When I came in with my oil change coupon he said he could do better and did.  This kind of honest, sincere treatment started a discussion with my wife about our next car.  We'll likely buy from Peter Pan and Oliver.  He has always been extremely helpful and sincere.  And I really hate car dealerships so these are big kudos coming from me.</Text>

<review>I would have given it a zero star if there is an option.  We walked in after exchanging emails on x5 the day before, and confirmed that it was ready.  We looked at one fully loaded X5 and we liked it well enough to give it a spin.   Then we were told  it could not be driven due to lack of gas, only to be "admired" on a static base...... After we politely indicated that we would buy only after test drive, we were told to wait for the car with gas to show up and  of course it didn't.   After 20 minutes we left.   Such episode left us wondering about the truth: Was it really waiting on gas or it was just not necessary, under the assumption that we could not afford it.    BTW,  this will be  our 3rd BMW and we will buy elsewhere.< /review>< pics>

We worked with Victor and I'd highly recommended him.

We've been trying to buy a new car for a while. We did our research on the Internet and knew the going price for the car we wanted.  But when we talked to two other dealers in the Bay Area, they either try to charge us more than the market rate or was really slow moving

Last weekend, we happened to be in Redwood City, and we decided to drop by to see if Peter Pan is any different.  We spoke with Victor Hung.  He's super busy and he runs (not walks) in the office.  He was busy helping another customer but he asked us a couple of quick questions and give us a couple of cars in stock to look at while waiting.  When we wanted to leave, he told us he'd be with us in 5 mins, he kept his promise.

We quickly narrowed down to 2 cars, and we decided to go with the car in stock.  He knew we did our home work, so we only had to go back and forth once, and we had a deal.  After we agreed on the price, he talked to his GM for a minute to confirm, and that was it.  Not the usual business of keeping you waiting for hours and going back and forth to the manager.

And after we decided to buy, we told him our company might have a corporate employee discount.  He tried very hard to find us the additional info so we can get the corporate discount.

All in all the best experience we've had in buying a car so far!</text></record></dataset><record>

I test drove a vehicle here that I really liked and I was interested in buying it. But when I asked a simple question about BMW services that were disabled on the car, the sales guy started avoiding the conversation and told me that all BMW dealerships have the same policy and treated me with contempt - I actually checked with other dealers and found that it was not the case.

So, my advice is to keep your dignity and avoid such people altogether. The sales guys here shrug you off when they have no answers as if they have no interest in making a sale.

There are better car dealers out there!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>For the past couple of months, I have been looking to lease a new BMW.  I am happy to report now that I had a very pleasant experience leasing a new vehicle from Peter Pan BMW, dealing with the Fleet manager Henry Sipor. Henry is an experienced, professional Fleet manager with a very pleasant manner.  After a stress-free agreement on the terms over the phone with Henry, it took less than 30 minutes to get the paperwork completed and pick up the vehicle.
This is not my first BMW lease, and I am glad to see that Peter Pan BMW and Henry Sipor have kept up the BMW professional tradition. I highly recommend dealing with Henry and I'll definitely be back to see him when the time comes for my next upgrade.</Review>< pictures>

I had an appointment with Peter Galanakis to shop for my first BMW.  Right away Peter made me feel very comfortable as I had absolutely no experience with this type vehicle.  After doing some internet searching I was in the market for a 5 series.  Peter explained the benifits of the 5 and took my wife and I on test drive.  This was the first time I had ever driven a BMW, he explained how the car works and all the functions that were available.  After returning to the dealership we sat down and Peter walked us through the process of "building" our car.  Once that was completed he explained the process of placing an order for the exact car we wanted.

My wife and I wanted to come home and think about this purchase.  After thinking this though we decided to make the purchase.  I contacted Peter and we met again.  He again was extremely helpful in explaining what our next steps were and we order our 540I.

Upon delivery of the car Peter took the time to demonstrate many of the features of the car before we took it home.  He also recommended that we drive the car for a few weeks and then contact him and he would set us up with one of their geniuses who would be able to explain in better detail the workings of our particular car.

I highly recommend Peter Pan BMW and Peter Galanakis if you are interested in a BMW.<//text>

Adam at Peter Pan is excellent. The whole car buying process was very simple. I was always afraid of going to a car dealership, but based on my experience with Adam and Peter Pan I am likely to buy more frequently.</text>

This is the only Bay area bimmer repair shop I'll goto even though I live in SF. John DePalma is my favorite service writer and had gone to bat for me a bunch of times to get things fixed with BMW of NA. Solid shop. Not to mention Bob and Tom at the parts counter are knowledgeable and really nice guys. This has been my shop for 6+ years and I don't plan on going elsewhere. BMW of SF are pretentious twits.</text>

<text>Very poor experience. Sold me a dealer owned car without telling my until the signature page of the contract. Both salesman and manager promised to send me some BMW certificates worth $250 which they never did. Never sent me a new car follow-up survey, perhaps afraid of what I would write. Nice car but would never return here.< /text>< date>

I was really impressed with the used Subaru that I purchased from here today, however, I really am left with a sour taste about my experience. I looked at the car prior to the detailing and everything was beautiful with no exterior damage. Later after detailing I noticed a scuff right in the front that was shockingly obvious. I do not know a lot about cars, but had a feeling this just happened with the detailing process and when I stated this concern the salesman Norm stated it was not. I was in a hurry to get home and agreed to a $200 discount and I was still pretty excited about car and price. After  I was home I took to body shop and they stated that this was damage due to buffing too close and they had put wax over it to try and cover it up- worse off, very expensive to fix.
I have to say that I was really happy with everything, Norm was nice and so was the rest of the staff, and the car is great, but now I can only notice this scuff that was not there prior to the detailing.
Having said that I would advise taking pictures of your car prior to any work, and do not let them detail the car as they have inexperienced people doing this.</text>

Horrible customer service. I've brought my car in for 3rd time complaining about extremely high pitch loud squeal coming from the front brakes. The noise is so loud that people across the street turn to see where it is coming from. My neighbor asked me what's wrong with the brakes because he keeps hearing them in the morning when I leave for work.

The SA and her manager kept telling me that's "normal" for performance brakes that BMW uses and refuse to do anything to fix the root cause. The manager David Brom just told me to take it with corporate as they won't let him replace parts to fix the problem. Called corporate they told me to go back to the dealer. They were just passing the responsibility back and forth and not taking ownership to fix an obvious issue. Keep in mind the car is under warranty.

After some research it turns out I wasn't the only one with this issue however BMW doesn't care and hides behind a piece of paper issued stating that it is normal to have noise brake. I've owned many other cars including Audi and Mercedes and none of them had this horrible problem of brake squeal. BMW let me down and certainly didn't provide the "ultimate driving machine" experience as they claim to be. Can't wait for warranty to be gone so I can take it to competent shop that will take care of the problem instead of Peter Pan refusing to acknowledge there is one.< /Review>

We purchased our BMW over a month ago. It’s a used, certified 3 series X-drive and it performs very well. It took us some time before we decided what we wanted. The team was pleasant and patient and Javed Ahmadzai advised us and assisted greatly through the whole process.</Review>

Extremely poor service experience, they called me to “squeeze” me in the Friday after Tgiving, I just needed headlights adjusted and oil change. When I delivered the car and received the loaner, all very efficient, the service advisor indicated it would be late in the day, I objected and made clear I wanted the car back earlier.  Off I went, later around 1:30 I received a text that they would need the car until Sat. possibly Mon. This after they called me.  After multiple attempts to get the advisor and a threat to call the Service mgr. the advisor answered and was clear they needed the car until Monday, I demanded my car back, picked it up late Friday, a complete waste of time.  No apology, in fact nothing, my car was just sitting out front, I got the keys and left.  This is all about Peter Pan and filling their schedule, the customer’s needs or wishes are secondary. BTW the customary follow up “how did we do “ never happened.  If you take your car to Peter Pan, plan on at least a complete day,  for busy people it is a hassle, the next time I buy a car, service will be a much more serious part of the equation.< /text>

went on a Tuesday - kinda raining around 10:16am and alot of customers already. Waited for 40mins but when I followed up, they are nothing but courteous. From Gus to Michele to Willy/Robert, all of my interaction is nothing but world-class. This is my first BMW service and it all exceeded my expectations. Love it and thank you</Review>

<review>It was a very good experience. My car died on the street one evening.  I got it towed to Peter pan next day.  Steve helped me.  He not only provided accurate diagnosis of the problem,  kept me informed and updated,  but also provided other very helpful advice. They also offered a loaner,  although I didn't need it. They are also very honest . My carhad problem due to fuel pump malfunction. They offered extended warranty so didn't even charge me.  When I picked up mycar,  it was washed and internal vaccumed. Overall,  it was Avery good experience.< /review><date>1556424935988< /date>< gmapID>

You will spend minimal time and get great service. Very courteous people have real interest to keep you satisfied. You will get also perfect loaner car or shuttle service. However do not go there to buy or lease a car. It is just waste time unless you do not care how much you pay. People there will tell you lying all time. A typical example a friend of mine went there and got a quote for a car and still had room for negotiation, so when I came there 2 hours after they gave me quote $2,000 more and swear they sell it for no profit. I hate such behavior. So go to East Bay BMW to get real price without ripping off.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a great experience purchasing my i3 from Adam Locke at Peter Pan. He did exactly what he said he would do and then some. He even proactively notified me when the CA rebate was available again. I would highly recommend working with him and the staff at Peter Pan.<//review>

Excellent service. Service advisor (Steve) was really helpful and informed me about a class action lawsuit on my car and inspected and made changes to the car for me. Replaced a part under recall without me prompting for it.
10/10 in terms of service.</Review>

I highly recommend the service department at BMW  Peter Pan generally and Wai Wong my advisor specially. I was stressed with my car had so many issues that needed to be fixed and Wai Wang did an amazing job giving me the best deal, following up with me about the repair and making sure that the car came out of service in the best possible shape.
On top of that she provided me with amazing courtesy black convertible car !!!!< /Text>

<review>I had an annoying rattle on my 2017 BMW and had the pleasure of having Oliver Vinluan as my service advisor, he is the ultimate professional he kept me informed about the status of my repair. His team found and fixed my rattle issue and Oliver also followed up the next day to see if the rattle returned, which it did not. I would highly recommend and trust bringing my car to him if I ever have future issues. Thank you Oliver.<//review>< Response>

I had an excellent experience at Peter Pan BMW. The staff was very knowledgeable and worked hard to meet my needs and address my questions. In the end, they delivered a car meeting all my specifications and as a team met all my expectations. I never write reviews, but I would recommend Peter Pan, and particularly Dick Rebozzi, to anyone looking for a fair deal, great value and superb service.</Review>

Our first purchase at Peter Pan BMW was great and it was probably one of our best car purchase experience ever. Mr. Javed Ahmadzai at Peter Pan BMW had done a wonderful job from end to end, and he made everything so easy for us on purchasing our first X1. His sincere customer service certainly earned the 5-star rating from us. The staffs who helped us test driving and processing the finance paperwork were also excellent. Their knowledge and service were superb. Overall, this purchase experience really exceeds our expectation. We highly recommend Peter Pan BMW and Mr. Javed Ahmadzai to anyone who interests buying their next bimmer.< /text>

Worked with Adam Locke to get a great price on my new 2018 BMW X3. Adam was easy to negotiate with, and made the process very easy. I would highly recommend calling Adam if you're in the market for a BMW. Coco was easy to work with in finance as well.</review>

We called few dealers around to find the car my wife was looking for. At the end we decided to visit the nearest dealer to us to test drive. We were introduced to fleet manager Henry Sipor at PeterpanBMW. Not that long, my wife was happy driving her new car home. Happy wife, happy life, right?
Thanks Henry-Thanks Peterpan.< /text>

<Review>We had a great experience over at Peter Pan BMW. Javed Ahmadzai was the one to help us with our purchase and made it super friendly, and made the process so much smoother. If you’re looking into BMW’s go to Peter Pan and request to see Javed!</Review>< pics>

<Review>My wife and I went there basically just to inform ourselfes about the car market here in CA, since we both are from germany. However, we ended buying a car. Everyone was super helpful and very informative, the car we got is in excellent condition. Special thanks to Adam Locke who helped us throughout the process. It was a great pleasure!</Review>< Time>

I had one of the best shopping experience of  a car from a Peter Pan BMW Eugene Masalitin was a fantastic sales person to work with. He went above and beyond to suggest and test drive several vehicles to compare and make the right choice.

Thank you once again. Definitely coming back when the lease is over.< /review>

<Review>My husband and I went to this dealership just to look for a car and we were lucky to meet Henry Sipor. Make the long story short we left the dealership happy and content and didn't feel like we were forced into anything . They even washed the car or wax not sure before giving it to me and a full tank of gas . Henry worked very hard to stay with in our budget and actually cared for us and what we needed,no wonder he had a full Cadenza of trophies and letters,can't say good enough things about Henry and Peterpan BMW. I bought the car I wanted and more and walked away happy and content. Anyone in a market for a car go visit the dealership and ask for him by name, you won't be sorry.
Ps they also took care of my lease return without a headache. Thank you to Henry and Peterpan BMW.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1543433542551, 'text': 'Hi Shadi, thank you for taking the time to post a review!

Was in the market for an SUV, checked out multiple brands and eventually bought one from Peter Pan BMW, San Mateo. Javed Ahmadzai who was our Sales consultant went above and beyond throughout the entire process!

We went in after doing some homework and I can confidently say that there was no BS from start to finish - he was honest, to the point and made the process a breeze. Highly recommend pinging Javed if you are in the market for a new car!

Overall: Very happy with my new car, Javed and his buddy Shak (in the finance department)!< /review>

<Text>Worst internet sales experience ever! No matter how many times I asked about the vehicle I was interested in nobody that emailed me provided any information. I tried calling a few times too. Eventually I got someone who rudely informed me that vehicle didn't pass their safety inspection and it was sent to auction. Even though I have now been told it is not available I have still received emails asking if I am still interested in the vehicle I asked about. No matter what I say or email nobody seems to listen or care. I will never go to this car dealership EVER!</Text>< Pics>

Be very careful before you decide to do business with Peter Pan BMW. I had a verbal agreement with sales agent Norm Kauble to buy a CPO vehicle from him, and was preparing immediately to drive 100 miles to buy it.  As we were talking via phone, he was very coincidentally interrupted by a colleague who was selling the car at that moment to another buyer in the showroom. Whether this is common practice or not, it strikes me as extremely disingenuous and opportunistic. Customer satisfaction is a VERY LOW priority at Peter Pan BMW...don't be fooled into believing otherwise.<//review>

He was manipulative, and lacked the information I needed. He was just a sales rep. (and a bad one of that), but acting as he is owning the BMW brand or is the CEO of it.

I ended up taking my business elsewhere purely because of the strange experience I got there. Got my new BMW from BMW of Mountain View (much much better experience, very helpful and informative).
Try to stay away from the guy, or rather this dealership entirely who hired him.< /review>< response>

I've been taking my i3 to Pete Scanlan at Peter Pan BMW for a couple of years and FWIW, HE IS THE REASON I BOUGHT A X5 35Isport.

Specifically, I had a problem with a door handle on the i3 that he was incredibly helpful on -- went the extra yard to make sure I was treated well.

This month, we were car shopping for my wife.  She wanted a Carrera but Pete's outstanding service and explanations are the reason why I pushed to get her into the X5 last week.</text>

I usually don't give one star review. But this time I have to.
I did a maintenance two month back at Peter Pan BMW. They helped me replaced my wind shield wiper. I didn't really paid attention to it since in California summer there is no rain. Then recently when cleaning the window I realized that the left blade is not fully attaching to the wind shield, thus not able to wipe it clean. Having no idea what's wrong (I even started to wonder if they really give me a new wiper during maintenance) I headed there to take a look. Then the advisor told me that "even if they put a new blade on, it's not fully attaching", and they think the wiper arm was bent and need to be replaced. They gave me a $200 quote for the arm replacement. Of course I am not convinced of their saying. So I went home, put the right blade on to the left arm and IT IS attaching. So how could they say that even if they put on a new blade it's the same??!! At the end I bent the blade a little bit and now it's fixed. I am surprised by the unprofessionalism and jump-to-conclusion approach they are taking. Totally disappointed.<//text>

< Review>
I've bought two BMWs from Peter Pan - one when it was privately owned and also from its new corporate owner, Penske Automotive Group.  The first was fine.  The second time, involved a couple of thousand dollars they stole from me as part of the car I returned on lease.  The car had a 45,000 mileage limit on it, I returned it with 32,000, and 4 pin-head sized pits in the lower part of the windshield.

They charged me $2,000 for the windshield and wear and tear when the car was returned in an almost near new state.  I sued in small claims court and won the first round.  They've appealed and we are going back for round #2 which they will lose too.  I'm in the process of contacting Channel 7 'On Your Side' and will continue to leave lovely reviews of them here and on Yelp.  :)

Do yourself a favor and buy your BMW elsewhere.  I've owned 5 now and will never return to this outfit.  Can you believe management would let them steal $2k in this market with the damage this does to their reputation?

My wife and I just picked up our second X5 from Bob Giarrusso last night.  It was great to see Bob and the team there again (Sales Manager Rob, F&I guy Shak, and GM Jim) and the remodel is amazing!  The process has always been simple and open faced and both times my wife and I visited the dealer just to sign and drive our new car home.  Great service and follow-up and of course a great deal each time without hassles or games.

When we purchased our first one in 2009, we lived in San Jose and have since moved to Marin - so we are driving past multiple BMW dealers each time to buy from Bob and the team at Peter Pan.  If you are looking to purchase a BMW I strongly recommend that you find out for yourself why it's worth the time to visit and buy from them in San Mateo.<//text>

<Review>Absolutely the worst leased return experience ever!
Had me waited over two hours for a 10 mins process. Keith was the guy to in charge of this and because I am not getting another car this time he purposely has me waited over two hours and when I told him that's the worst experience I ever had. Jim who sits next to him jump in the conversation and told me to return the car elsewhere if I am not happy!

<Text>In the market for a BMW M4. Worked with Peter Galanakis, sales.
Everything below is factual:
- 11/24 brought in my 2009 Porsche 911 4S to get an estimate
- car was evaluated at 20% less than what Carlsen Porsche, Autobahn motors or the Tesla folks offered
- I bought three other cars from Peter Pan BMW. The first in 2001 - X5, second in 2002 - 530i, third in 2006 - 330i

The question is whether the folks at BMW are honest in their business practice? You decide.
My decision - steer clear from them.<//Text><Name>Octavian Tanase< /Name><gmap_id>0x808f9efc33be4f95:0xc1b7f19c392f036a<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

<user>111402645413623682318</user><user_name>Tony P<//user_name><date>1516897406763<//date><rating>1</rating><Review>These guys are complete scums when it comes to lease return.   We had trouble with them 3 years ago when we planned to purchase our X6.   That's the reason we ended up leasing/buying our vehicles from Alexanders in LA.
Beware they write up all sorts of stuff.   They don't follow any BMW lease end guidelines.   We noticed that with BMW Dingometer you're charged only for dings an scratches over 2 inches.   But they will ask you sit back while they will go around and write up even 1/2 inch scratches and put round numbers like $400, $800 for each.  Just literally whatever comes to their mind.    They write up stuff that's tiny  dents and marks on the bottom portion of the front bumper, which we have no control over stones and debris hitting them.     They will lie to you every which way, before until they get you to sign the lease end contract and after the contract is signed, they will tell you nothing is covered, and your coverage or protection you have won't work.    I think the dealership trains them specially for this type of actions.   We have leased BMWs  in the past and had little or no issues returning leases.   I mean if this is what they do to customers who buy high end models, we can only imagine what kind of con they pull on others.   We also saw other lease return reviews here and not surprised.  Unfortunately it was a little close to our lease end date and we didn't much time in resorting back to our LA dealer, who literally told us to truck it to them at little to no cost.
Another con, they pull is that if they do a previous inspection  and rack up charges and you challenge them and get it fixed, they would find new things to charge on when you fix the vehicle and bring it back for return.   They have a number in their head for your vehicle (obviously using bmw sales people to get lease returns is like guarding the hen coop with a fox) and they want to get that out from you.  So they keep marking stuff on your car, until it meets that number .  You try to fix that and bring it back, they will find new things to meet that number.   We have seen nothing of this sort.
To make it worse, we took the vehicle for service and they dinged the side of the vehicle.   We found that our on the 2nd inspection and they wrote us up on that too!!
WARNING AND ADVISE TO LEASEE'S:   Our advise for lease returns is to be with these guys and watch out carefully on what they write up for.  Do the pre-inspection and don't sign any final contract.   Get inspection from other independent agents.   Otherwise they would tell you everything you need to believe, until the last inspection, they will literally write up  They will tell you everything is fine and your coverage will take care of stuff, until you sign the  inspection.   Once it's done, then all bets of off.   Nothing they say will be the truth.   Don't trust a thing.   Better do you own research and check your original contract and coverages.
It's bunch of greedy sales guys who have nothing better to do who take in these lease returns.   Both the sales manager Jim and rob Jensen they work hand in hand in making this happen.  Which means you can guess what anyone else who's taking the return will do when the managers do this scam.    Obviously it's not a sale, and they get nothing, so they use their usual charming sales tactics  in lease return to lie and lie and get to a point you've gotten to a place of no return.

If you're tired of dealers like this like we do, just get your BMWs from LA just like us and return it to them.  Alexanders imports literally gets our vehicle leases to our front door from LA and takes the leased car back , no hassles.  That's why they're rated 4+ stars everywhere and stand high on BMW NA unlike any other scamming dealership here.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1517007833763, 'text': "Tony P,\n\nI apologize the lease inspection process was not what you expected. Peter Pan BMW is authorized by BMW Financial Services to conduct inspections on their behalf. We are able to perform these inspections as a courtesy to any clients regardless of the lease origination dealer and without the need for an appointment. We are held to the highest of standards for such inspections as set forth by BMW Financial Services. Unfortunately, the amounts of the charges outlined in the lease inspection are set by BMW Financial Services and are not able to be adjusted by any dealer performing the inspection. I do understand your frustration with the 3rd party Lease Wear/Tear policy you purchased as part of your lease. This unfortunate difference in opinion with BMW Financial Services guidelines is why we have eliminated any 3rd party financial products offered with our leases and ONLY offer BMW Financial Services products. Once again, I apologize the experience didn't meet your expectation and we hope that we can offer you a better experience in the future.\n\nBest Regards,\nJim Thomas\nGeneral Sales Manager\nPeter Pan BMW"}<//response>< Gmap_id>

Impossible to get him on the phone even though he claims to be in internet sales. In the last 8-9 days have left 3+ messages and called 5+ times, never heard back. Not a great email communicator either. Talked to him couple of times way back, enthusiasm was rock bottom for a sales person.
Given that he's rock bottom, working with anyone else would be a blessing.< /Review>< rate>

<Text>Not a trustworthy dealer at all !
Very disappointing experience while making deal with sales agent Mr. Dmitriy Shamilov. He called himself an internet sales agent but he has negative level of skills on how to deal with customers.
I was contacted this Peter Pan BMW to buy X1 model and Mr. Dmitriy Shamilov was my point of contact for my purchase. We made all purchase deal with email conversation and finally made a appointment to buy the vehicle.
However, When I went to dealership to buy the vehicle he totally disagreed on what he promised to me. He started saying me he didn't reply my email but when i showed his reply then he was totally nervous and said me that let me talk to his manager. He lost for few minutes, After back he said we can't sale this vehicle now for what he promised to me. OOPS MOMENT !!!
And he made a new quote at high price, he totally forgot what he made conversation with me on email and what he promised for.
I can say this sales person Dmitriy Shamilov and Peter Pan BMW don't have business integrity and don't care his customers and try to make customers fool. VERY BAD!!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
What can I possibly say about these scumbags that isn't already mentioned.  I've owned BMWs exclusively for over a decade and I've been to dealerships all over the country.  Nowhere will you find such incompetence than here.

I brought in my 2012 335i for a maintenance and an infrequent "Powertrain Malfunction".  It wasn't a big deal, it just popped up, you'd pull over, stop, restart....  it's going great.  This happened once or twice in a few months time.  I chalked it up to some recall or electronics or even getting some bad gas.  (Though, always premium.)

Cut to months later, I can barely drive the car 20 miles without it coming up.  And the car goes into limp mode when it happens, so on the freeway, I gotta maneuver out of the way.  Bring it in...  they all but call me a liar.  Finally, after getting video, they offer me $2k off the purchase of a new car.  You can get better than that on the website.  However, they never failed to try and upsell me when I was in on a service.  And, despite their dogged troubleshooting techniques, they never drove the car more than 1-3 miles.  Really bang up job guys.

To top it all off, I just want rid of this thing so I barely drive it for 9 months just waiting for the lease to expire.  I finally get the option to turn it in early, at my own cost, for the problems their warranty should have fixed.  But I was just sick of taking off work to go get it and deal with them.  On the way to literally drop the car off, it dies completely.

I was told by their "General Sales Manager" that there was nothing that would be done.  They didn't honor their warranty...  oh well.  And proceeded to try and sell me another.  Unbelievable.

The real shame is that it was a wonderful car until this.  And I've been a loving owner of so many for so long.  Now they just have me looking at other companies.

Well, that's enough for me.  I needed a hobby.  And my new hobby is telling everyone how terrible Peter Pan is.  Shouldn't be hard.< /Review>

<Review>No one likes it when their car is 6-months out of warranty, then breaks down.  My 530i broke down on the freeway on the way home from San Francisco airport after a long business trip.  Water pump failure right after the car turned 100,000 miles (extended warranty).  I had my car towed to the nearest BMW dealer which turned out to be Peter Pan BMW.  I had never been there before.  Despite this, I was treated VERY well.  I had an absolutely great service advisor (Roel Vela); he helped get me a loaner vehicle and got my car into the maintenance queue late on a Friday afternoon right before a holiday weekend.  He was later very helpful in explaining exactly what went wrong, how much it would cost to repair, and kept me informed what my repair options were.  I think Mr. Roel Vela represented Peter Pan and BMW very well. I'd highly recommend their service department and especially, Roel.  Great service.</Review>< gmap_id>

I purchased my BMW Certified Pre-owned 2012 Z4 from Peter Pan BMW in September 2015.  I noticed the front bumper had popped out from its plastic clips while it was parked in our garage a few days later.  We decided to wait until the first service to have these clips replaced.
Six months later while having my Z4 in for regular service, I brought to the attention of the service center mechanic the problem with my bumper constantly popping out, thinking it might need just clips replaced. They looked at it and suggested I bring the car back to the sales department.  I called and asked to speak to someone who could take a look at the problem.  Unfortunately it did not go as well as I would have expected.  Sales rep. Keith Ray was immediately defensive, accusative and downright condescending with me, blaming me for the damage and he never even looked at the car.  I then met with the sales Manager, Rob Rensen and he looked at bumper, but never once popped the hood open.  He said he would bring this up to the General Manager Jim Cyr for Peter Pan BMW and Rob asked that I call him back a few days later, which I did and left a voicemail.  I then called again the following week – still no call back.  I emailed him directly and still no response.   Finally I got a hold of Rob over the phone a few weeks later only to give me the news that there is nothing that can be done because I waited too long to call back.
So much for the BMW certified Pre-Owned BMW program.  It is supposed to have been inspected by a BMW trained technician, but somehow they missed a few details, the biggest was the bracket that holds the front bumper, as it was almost failing when they sold it and did not want to stand behind their own car.
I took my BMW to my own certified mechanic and he ordered parts needed, it was a simple part replacement and not a complete replacement of the front bumper which is what Kevin and Rob presumed.   All it took was someone with some brains and a genuine interest in their customer to open the hood and really do a thorough check to find it was a simple inexpensive bracket replacement, in this case less than $30 dollars plus the labor to replace it.
I can live with that small cost to repair my car.  I am still very proud of it, but what I can't live with is the thought that others will be treated in pretty much the same way I was.  No one and I mean no one should be treated in a condescending and rude manner ever.
This is no way to conduct and/or run a business.  I won’t be taking my BMW to Peter Pan BMW as they have shown very clearly where they stand - a lack of basic knowledge and a lack of professional courtesy.< /Text>

< review>
I droppped my 2007 328i in for service on Saturday. On monday I got a call from John DePalma, that my car was ready. Michelle Gladieux greeted me when I got to the counter with friendliness and professionalism. I have been servicing my car there for many years, and Michelle has always been that smiling face of the service department. And thanks to John, everything was performed as promised and on time. I highly recommend Peter Pan BMW if you need to service your car. If it wasn't for the excellent treatment I received, I would not waste my time in writing a review. But I believe they deserve it.<//review>

****Roel Vela!**** - he is my service adviser and also assistant service manager - he is so great!  He treats me as if I purchased the Z8 new (I purchased a CPO Z4 8 years ago!) - this whole establishment treats you with respect and honestly, like a friend.  You are greeted with a smile, escorted to the lobby where you can get hot coffee and a snack (if you have to wait at all) or if you don't have to wait, you can get it afterwards....there is a very clean and wonderful restroom as well - then your wonderful service adviser comes to get you (in my case ****Roel Vela****) and your car is whisked away for the care that only a mother could give (every BMW is treated like family here)  - the loaner cars are fabulous and the adviser (ROEL!) makes sure to call you and give you updates on your car - done or not, waiting on parts, nothing wrong with the car etc...I love Peter Pan BMW and their excellent service by every adviser I've ever had there - my next purchase of a car will DEFINITELY be a BMW!  Thank you Peter Pan BMW!<//Text>

We are california auto upholstery , along with legacy auto and San carlos tech. we worked on this vehicle to figure what bmw could not, BMW car has mat sensor problems, its a computer, not the mat, they claim we did a bad installation, wrong, their computer said bad mat sensor, its actually inside.. bmw manufactor problems, we send like $800 to buy 2 mat sensor.
Name that works there .
Brooke service manager
David , i think, incopetent technitioan,
they call them selfs, bmw specialist, they know it all,  they should actually go back to school and learn a little more.
btw my name is Martin and I work at california auto, Dont take it to Bmw never, even if you are the richest man on earth, take it to bmw indy specialist ...
like in san carlos tech, or legacy,.
it's sad we all have to write bad reviews
but Mr. brooke and tech David, please ya'll shall quit, custer is always right with prooves and everything and you still insist customer is wrong,
ya'll just replace parts thats's all you know what to do, you dont know how to fix diagnose the parts by hand and brain,
your brain is a computer,
yes this is personal .....thanks for hanging up the phone on me  such a great customer service, can't hold it when someone tells you  guys that you diagnose wrong and want to avoid any return,,
this is more than you need.</Text>

<Text>Unorganized, cars dirty with pitch and bird droppings. Don't they clean all that off before the show them in the lot. Shows laziness and that is not professional. Called ahead and it still took over 25 minutes for our car, even though it was "ready". Hum, not so good.<//Text>< user_name>

I wanted to buy a BMW (new one) from these guys. My God, this car dealer has the worst customer service I have ever seen. No one attends to you, no one cares when you are looking for help or have questions, super arrogant attitude! The sales people are rude and impolite!

BUYERS STAY AWAY!!!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I had the most amazing car buying experience with Henry Sipor at Peter Pan BMW in San Mateo. When I first walked in, I wasn't even sure if I was going to buy a car from there on that day. But after a brief chat with Henry not only he helped me find the perfect car that fit all my parameters, but also he went above and beyond to help me get the best deal and best overall value I wouldn't find anywhere. Trust me I had been looking and observing the market for weeks prior.

Like most people, I always dreaded to spend my entire day buying a car from a large dealership and deal with a lot of haggling and arm-wrestling with the sales team, managers, etc. However, every aspect my interaction with Henry was on point and centered around my needs, my budget and ideal payment terms. He made sure every single question I raised was taken care of to my full-satisfaction. He absolutely good at what he does. He engaged the right parties to help me and his entire team offered my the best customer service one can possibly expect from a premium auto dealership.

In addition to his professionalism, Henry is such an intelligent and interesting man, not only I enjoyed his effortless handling of my car buying experience in a matter of a couple of hours, but also thoroughly enjoyed to chat with him about his background, knowledge, wisdom and utterly positive outlook at life. It's been several days, since I purchased the car, but I am still on the clouds enjoying my car and positive experience I had with wonderful Henry Sipor. If you are in the market for new or used BMW cars, do yourself a favor and go see Henry. He'll make sure you leave Peter Pan BMW as a happy new owner of another ultimate driving machine! :)< /Review>< pics>

<username>邵聪明</username><time>1615256864127</time><rating>5</rating><review>(Translated by Google) In order to buy a car, I went to many car dealers. After comparing all aspects, I chose to buy it at peter pan bmw. Ivy Wong & Victor Hung are really the best dealer I have ever seen. They are very sincere and can feel it. The price and attitude are impeccable. Very recommended, if you need to buy a car, it is good to find Ivy and Victor, they can speak Chinese very convenient.
