Some honest straight forward folks.  I feel theyve read my situation and honestly gave me some leniency to helped me out just because its the right thing.  The price is very fair and something you can be confident in.  They'll say what's the right course of action meanwhile telling you the other options with their inherent flaws and how they feel about them. "You want to replace this a week later?  I'd advise against it because of this,  but otherwise don't go to far and stay off the freeway"

I've hesitated before and ended up with more frustration than any 20$ I might have saved.  I've tried most of the local options and this is the best felt after spending a bundle because you get what you pay for.  They haven't been wrong so far and they have proved it by literally showing me what they are talking about.</Text>

Came here for a BASIC oil change and they could not even get that right. The "technician" (using that word very loosely here) spent about 30 minutes trying to up sell me a transmission change that my car "desperately needed" , although the manufacturer of the vehicle doesn't recommend doing it until 150k miles (my car is no where near that). After finally convincing them it wasn't gonna happen the oil change proceeded and i got my car back. After some driving I noticed smoke coming from my hood. When I was finally able to get a look under the hood I realized that these morons forgot to put the oil cap back on my car. I contact them and was told I should buy an oil cap myself and if I wanted to they would reimburse me. After having to explain the situation over and over to them they finally agreed to give me a refund for the oil change. When I told them that I would be taking my car to a Dealership for inspection as most of the oil fell onto the engine and obviously the extent of the damage caused by their mistake is unknown until I get it properly inspected by REAL MECHANICS. This is when their attitude changed and suddenly they would not give me anything (the oil cap they lost or the refund for the oil change that I would need to do again). The manager (Bryant- had no name tag or any actual proof of being manager so that may not even be his actual name) told me they had NO CORPORATE OFFICE which is a complete lie. But don't expect corporate to be any more helpful. I have called and spoken to 3 different people all who say there is no one available to help and they would return my call which I am still waiting for). This company is full of scammers and will tell you your car needs services done when they don't even know the specifications of your vehicle. I've had to resort to resolving this through the legal system. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere that has properly trained technicians.<//Review>

Went to get a Basic Tuneup.  I was quoted $210.  In the middle of the job, the managers tells me that there is a problem getting one of my spark plugs out because it is in a difficult location.  Just for a Basic tuneup, they kept my car overnight, then called me the next day to tell me now my tuneup will cost another $375 because it will take them 3 1/2 more hours in labor to get the 1 spark plug out.  He said they have seen these problems before with the kind of car I have but never bothered to tell me that initially.  If they have seen this problem before, why wasn't I advised of this prior to them working on my car.  They waited til my car was broken down and told me this and I didn't have a choice but to pay the higher price if I wanted my car back.  When I expressed my concerns to the 'supposed" manager, Brian, he was very rude, argumentative and obviously didn't understand the concept of 'customer service".  He was very concerned with proving his point and being right rather than making it right with the customer.  Stay away from this place.  I warn you now.</review>

Do NOT ever go to this place. They do not know what they are doing, they're lazy, unprofessional etc. One of the workers there messed up my starter after getting a smog and try to blame it on the car that it needed to be replaced when I was right there when it happened. They also suck at smog checks the only reason why they failed mine was cause the air box was shifted a little out of place and the guy said it was quote "missing a piece" and I moved it back into place and he felt pretty dumb. Avoid this place don't ever go there They'll only take money out of your pockets< /review>

I got my front brakes done in October 2013, when I reviewed the work with the manager, I asked him about the back brakes just to be told that the back brakes were at 80% and did NOT need to be changed and that I had at least 6 months to a year to go until they needed to be replaced. Not more than a week later, my back brakes go out, I return my car to them and they tell me that my back brakes went out because I had "driven with my emergency brake on." You can't move this car with the brake down. He said that my calipers had been stuck in the down position and that I had to replace the roters (because they don't have the tools to resurface roters) and replace the brake pads and the calipers. Total cost at that point was over $500.00 (this is in addition to what I had already paid for the front brakes of over $300.00). I had no choice but to let them do the work. When I returned to pick up my car, all of a sudden, there was another "issue" with the car. They had stated that there was an oil leak from an oil line that had to be replaced which ran me $135.00. I had not been previously called to be informed of this being needed, I had a working phone so there was no excuse to why I was not previously informed instead I get told when I arrive and then had to wait over an hour while that work was done.
Less than 6 months later, I yet again have issues with my brakes. My friend takes the car to another place and they tell him that all 4 brakes are shot, the brake pads are worn down to the CORE, everything has to be replaced AGAIN!!! Then I am informed that this place uses "Organic Brake Pads" which don't have the same metal as traditional brake pads which cause them to wear down a lot faster, this is information NEVER relayed to me verbally or in writing.
I don't drive long distances and I don't ride my brakes and I don't have a need to slam on my brakes so there is no reason that these brakes and brake pads should be worn down to metal after LESS than 6 months of being newly installed.

Don't go to this place, you'll only be wasting your money and time.<//review>

I noticed when the check light on the dashboard oil came on the engine ran out of oil I went and let them know What happened and was upset by the place manager did not believe me, perhaps I am crazy to remove the filter and run my car without oil very bad service the truth I do not return or recommend

<Review>First timer at this place trying local Mexican food and I loved the flavors. Its not a fancy joint but the food is excellent. I'm not big on onions but I ate them since they complimented the carne asada. I usually use hot sauce or something but I ate the jalepeno that was roast and it gave it a good kick. Can't lie I would of went to the other few places like Diane's and Chile Verde. But what I did like most was the beans. They didn't look like they came out of a can. Plus their totillas look and taste handmade and not store bought. They were authentic and lots of other variety like birria, babacoa, cactus.. Im coming back to check out the rest of their menu.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dd35af8b6aaac5:0xcf8d3eac8888760d</GmapID></record>

< review>
Lots of options.  Per recommendation of a patron I ordered the barbacoa soup which they packed with care with onions and cilantro, salsa and hand made tortillas.  Popular spot that I ended up just stopping by at. The juices/ smoothies are fresh and a great buy.  Friendly staff and customers. Thank you!<//review>

<Review>Small location, big on taste and freshness! I don't see why it's still called a carneceria (meat market) as you can't get meat but the restaurant portion is all it needs. They should remodel and make it a bigger cooking area and maybe some booths instead of the simple tables. Food selection is something like 30-40 items but they do them very well. Birria, menudo, pozole, tacos, burritos, tortas. All the usual Mexican stuff done very very good!< /Review></record>

The food was very good and fresh. The pazole was amazing and just the right temperature. The burritos were good as well. Would love to see guacamole with the pazole. Restaurant was very clean and the food came fast.< /Review>

The customer service is friendly, although it could be improved if someone were exclusively responsible for taking orders, charging and answering calls to make the service more agile and professional.

I came in here for a pedicure and asked for Van. He greeted me right away and was very professional! He gave just the right pressure massage and also took off the gel and filed and gave me a clear coat on my nails. Definitely a repeat customer in me.💯❤🙌🏽🙌🏽Thank you Van< /text>

<Time>1598937017810<//Time><Review>Me and my daughter in love and her mother went in for an appointment 8/29/20. I got the #1 package with gel for the pedicure. After trying to help diffuse a situation due to overbooking on the salons end, I  was under the impression she would finish my package.I also explained to her that I had been having issues with a callous and asked for it to be filed down more.That did not happen. $58 smh. I was sent over to the male technician for a gel manicure. He cut my skin a few times and when I said I'm bleeding he didn't acknowledge or do anything. This also happened with my daughter- in-love. Her hand has knicks all over it. Two days later,, her hands are hurting and bleeding...looking infected. The job was not professional and it felt like we were being rushed out.. We paid altogether $200.00 The polish on our toes is fine. 8/31/20 Polish on our nails is chipping. The overall service was terrible. If we had more time & didn't have an event to attend I would have asked to have the paint on my hand removed. All in all I think they need more experienced help & better organization.  I am truly disappointed. This was a first time visit for us and was supposed to be a special  treat. This was definitely not worth the amount we paid.</Review><Rate>1<//Rate><Response>None</Response>< name>

<review>Worst experience I had to keep asking them to cut skin from cuticle, the lady polished my nails had to remove the Polish three times because it was lumpy, finally another lady came put liquid in Polish so it wouldn't be lumpy, I paid for manicure and pedicure 1 1/2 hours later they told me I had to wait 15 to get manicure because customers had appointments, I had a appointment to and should got complete service, no oil, no lotion used and they raised their prices, no massage chair and you paying the same price and not getting nothing included in service.

I've been going to Top Coat for four years now. When my nail technician moved out of state, I had to find someone that would do just as good or better and Tran does just that for me. I love my nails long and to reflect a piece of my personality - I can't do anything without them!<//text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><rate>1</rate><review>I have been coming to this place for years. They do great work, but do not always offer a great service. Many times I make an appointment, and wait about 30 to 45 minutes to be seen.

Today I came in after previously making an appointment for four people to be seen. Each person was seen about 10 minutes apart, and I was not seen at all, as they were offering to see me at the time my group was almost finished with their service.

Then when I questioned one of the workers I was told "an appointment doesn't mean you're seen at that time, we're busy working."

They obviously DO NOT understand the definition of an appointment. An appointment is exactly that, a set time of a meeting, in this case, a set time for a service.

With that being said, as I was paying for the group service, I spent $150 to have three pedicures, and wasted an hour of my time, and I wasn't even offered a discount.

This is the third and last time I will deal with unprofessional service. Three other customers had the same Terrible Experience today.

There are other nail shops in the area that do just as good of a job, and are better at understanding what an appointment means!!!!

I am just posting this for other customers that don't have time to be wasted!!!<//review><gmap_id>0x809b29de502febef:0x3f187dd035b016e5<//gmap_id>< userid>

I had the most horrible experience and service. I told the nail technician that I was no longer interested in gel polish she refused to listen. She never treated my cuticles. Told me I was dry. The polish was bubbling up on my nails and she said well it’s then polish that’s the problem and would not it until I insisted strongly. My nails are thick and misshapen and not uniformed. They do not look natural. They have dents in them. I brought this to her attention and she said she wasn’t done. I asked her who did her nails I want that same natural look straight from the cuticle as you. She said no you have tips. They did not have all advertised gel polishes. Which was another reason why I stated that I did not want gel polish on my nails multiple times. This was horrible. The pictures speak for themselves. Just got those done less than hour of this post.< /Review>

<user_id>117544442465334942481<//user_id><Review>I am new to gel nails. (4 times) The nail technician used an electric file to remove the gel nails. The Past 3 times The nail technician soaked the nails off. When this was done my nails lasted over 3 weeks. No issues. Keeping the structure of my own nails. In searching the Internet they are supposed to be soaked off, not using and electric file to remove the gel polish. I believe because the technician used the electric file my nails only lasted three days and started  chipping immediately.
I am very disappointed it made me feel like they didn’t care about me only the money they were going to receive and how quickly they could get me out.
I cannot recommend this place.  I need a salon that cares about me and is more concerned about a job well done not their wallet!< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< pics>

Have been going there for several years. The service is great and they bend over backwards to get the service "right". I value feeling treasured and important and they not only do me that way, warmly announcing my arrival (with a cute nickname), but they also seem to be alert to and kind to all customers. Is it perfect? No. But it is definitely Top Notch and the name fits. Try Leon or Van for really great "man hand" pedicures, Lena for brows and anyone for nails. Just stop in and watch how they work....very busy and it's because they are truly Tops! Love it!< /Text>

If you go for a pedicure, definitely ask for Van. He is so patient and take his time to make sure you have a good visit. He even helped my nieces pick out sparkly nice colors! The women worker that was working on me, seems like she was so in a rush.<//Review>

I went for a $30 basic pedicure (walk-in). Sure you can get a $20 one elsewhere but not as sanitary. Top Nail uses disposable bags in the basin. They truly take the time with you, amazing footscrub, massage and cuticle oil process. They treat you like the Queen you are! Even when you don't have an appointment and they're busy - no hesitation and with a smile. (Perhaps $$ is a factor, but you don't feel like you are just a number). If you are one of the frequent customers, you are greeted with a hug and your first name.</review>

Good customer service! But not coming back. Why? Well.. the women who did my nails was unable to do a good short coffin nail. She had even told me she couldn't. I've gotten this style before, and with the great reviews of this place I figured I'd be a piece of cake. Unfortunately it wasn't. Also the way she cut and filed them, just seemed unprofessional. She also wasn't to great on putting nail polish on. It got on my skin a bit and looks a little bubbly on some nails.</Text>

I’ve never complained and tip her well.  Even times that she has someone else do my pedicure I’m ok with it.  Last Friday I had the worst pedicure I ever had in my life. And over charged for it,  So horrible I was speechless but in a hurry to catch my plane to WA.  I took a pic sent it to Kathy and she agreed I would get a redo when I returned.   Today I came in had my pedicure done and was charged another 45 with a 5 discount.  I’m shocked.  They will be losing a long time customer.  I kills me to part ways with Kathy but I feel cheated by the guy that collects the money.</text></record></dataset><record>

I had been going here for months, but after today, I won't ever go back. I went in when they were almost empty, wanting to get a full set, a fill for my niece and a mani/pedi for my daughter, easily $100. They took my niece, and then made her get up when an appointment walked in, ignored me and my daughter for over an hour, let 4 walk-ins ahead of me and when I asked the employee that took the 4th walk-in if the girl had an appointment before me, she told me to ask someone else and walked away. Never goin back.<//Review>

First time at tip coat 3 days ago and my experience was horrible. The lady who did my nails didn’t do my nails the original way that I wanted them. Then she over charged for my nails charging 50 dollars just for my nails with no design. After she finished my nails and feet she told me it was 75 dollars. I only had 70 bucks so I used my card. Then she charged my card 90 bucks which really pissed me off. I feel taken advantage of and highly upset.I get my nails done routinely on the regular I know how I like my nails done and I know quality as well. Adding to the fact I never had an experience like this one before. Now I’m out of town 3 days later  now I lost three nails already and a forth one lifting up. My nails haven’t even been done a week!!😡😡 This was my first experience and I will NEVER!!! Go back!!! Over charge and the quality sucked now I have to get a whole new full set out of town😡😡😡. Super inconvenience and a waste of money and time. Don’t waste your money and time ladies.< /Text>

< Review>
When I first walked into the salon there was a very nice nail technician trying to deal with a very difficult customer. Unfortunately he had to hand her over to the manager and it turned out it was all over a Groupon on that she wanted to use. I found the whole issue ridiculous what she was saying and decided to stay. The manager came over to me after he was done with her and ask me what service I needed and I requested a shellac manicure. I found all of the staff to be wonderful and professional.   The gal that actually did my nails was very sweet and I really am pleased with her work.  I live in San Diego but the next time I have to up in Sacto I will make sure use Topcoat Nails again.<//Review>

<review>I'm very disappointed with this place. The lady who gave me a pedicure did a mediocre job. She charged me $45 for a deluxe spa pedicure, but with very minimal foot massage and callus removal which was supposed to be part of the package. She applied nail polish on my toes without having cleaned them properly, the whole time she was just talking.<//review>< Pics>

Top of the line Nail Salon! My 88 year old friend and her 30 year old grandson introduced me to a new experience in pedicures and manicures. Massage chairs, designer treatments including cappuccino lotions and hot rocks. Friendly and clean!< /text>

This is an extremely convenient gas station because of its location along the 14 freeway. Fuel prices are reasonable as most arco stations are. But their mini mart is also well stocked. If you are on your way to a long trip, swing by and pick up a few snacks and drinks.< /text>

<name>Asher Maslan</name><Review>It was a great place to stop on our long journey.we are going to visit a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility that is state-run not too far from here. The choices of hot beverage weregreat. Several different types of coffee and they also had hot chocolate. The drink selection was also good witches I needed facet of the trip. Reasonable gasoline prices for a remote location.< /Review></record>

This place  always has gas I love it there's one on every corner and it's convenient and cheapest guess maybe water down sometimes it seems and no one wants to siphon it when you got that gas so it all works out for everyone they always have bubble gum chips and soda ever run out kind of cool</review>

Convenient stop off of the 14 North.  Restroom facilities are worse than usual.  Two stinky "porta potties" in sub-standard condition.  Next time I'll find a different place to stop if anyone in the car needs to use a restroom.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) They do not accept credit cards that are not from the USA, so tourists cannot load gasoline there since they do not accept cash. The store next door is well stocked.

<Text>We’ve been a customer of Pro Pacific Pest Control for almost 10 years and have never had a bad experience. Customer service is their strength. Pricing is very fair and our technician has always arrived at the schedule time. The owners Shane and Ben run an outstanding pest control company. We love supporting a local family business.</Text></record>

<Text>I am so impressed with the effectiveness of gopher control performed by Pro Pacific. After years of trying different methods and services to get rid of gophers, now so we can landscape our slopes with water from our new well, without the gophers eating everything. This is the first service that has demonstrated their effectiveness. So, I just extended the gopher control with Pro Pacific to the rest of property, and coverage for other pests as well. The technician, Joe, was very professional and knowledgeable as explained everything about their services.   Thanks so much!</Text><rating>5</rating><UserId.>101559954420630725445</UserId.>< name>

We are very happy with our pest service here! Richard is our technician, and he is the sweetest! He does a great and thorough job and if I have any specifics I need done, he does it without hesitation! Not only does he do a great job he is very friendly and always makes time to say hello and chat for a few minutes. It’s wonderful to be able to get to know the people that work hard to make your home better! I would 10/10 recommend pro pacific pest control and continue to look forward to their wonderful service!</review>

Juan and Carlos were very efficient and professional when they came to do the monthly check up for rodents. They examined the old traps, removed them w rodents inside and put new ones. Highly recommend  these guys!<//Review>

<Review>We recently moved and found that we had not only a spider issue but rats! I quickly called various pest control companies. Pro Pacific was quick and on it and had sent Daniel out the very next day to overlook the problems and provide us with an estimate. He was extremely thorough and walked us through all that his company offered. Their pricing is competitive and fair. We signed the agreement that evening and they sent their technician by the name of Richard out the following morning. Richard was great!! He was thorough and attentive. He and Daniel both answered the many questions I had. I absolutely recommend this company to anyone who is need of pest control services.<//Review>< date>

<review>We ha a bee infestation around a pond that had stegnant water for several months.  I had put a little bleach in the water to keep from getting Msquitoes. Unfortunately I killed the bees.  There were still a few hanging in the area.  He did not find a hive.  He treated the area to keep them from coming back. Things looked much better today. Water is even clear.  We have a 30 day warranty.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Had bees move into a wall space...they were terrific at remediation and prevention.  Also thought I heard little footsteps of the rodent variety...they went around the entirety of the house and garage and closed all potential openings...found a nest outside the house and remediated that.

<text>Anthony was great!!!
He was very knowledgeable and I believe he was very very thorough also! He went up into two of my attic accesses and setup 7 rat traps today…also went up on my roof and found a couple of openings and he identified an area underneath the water heater external door with an opening that we have now gotten metal mesh applied over it!

Thank you so much Anthony I want to complement him on his professional and friendly demeanor...

<review>I have been using Pro Pacific for years and I absolutely trust them with all my pest control needs. I live by the woods and over the years, they have come out to take care of bee removal, rodent issues, ants both inside and outside the house, venomous and non-venomous spiders, and everything in between. Juan is one of the managers who has come out to do treatment when one of the regular techs can't come out, and he is a super friendly, knowledgeable, and great customer service guy. I highly recommend Pro Pacific Pest Control.<//review></record>

Pro Pacific is the Best Pest Control Company! They took care of the mice that invaded our home for 8 months. After hiring other pest control companies, having the attic sealed and cleaned, and having 2 roofing companies check the roof for openings, the mice were still running around the attic and between the first and second floor.  After searching online and finding their website and watching their informative video it was convincing that Pacific Pro can do the job.  From the initial phone call to the weekly trap checks Pacific Pro knows how to do the job well done the first time. Their 2 Techs that came out to look for openings found the hole in the roof the mice had chewed through to get inside the house. They sealed it and still heard activity, but the following week Bobby came out to check the traps and found 3 dead mice. Bobby and the 2 Techs are professionals and courteous. Since then it's been quiet and now we can sleep! The weekly check ups have even been getting shorter and shorter since there has been no activity! Thank you Pro Pacific you have a great team!<//Text>

At the time of this posting, I have just gotten an estimate.  Daniel Clark came out to evaluate my property for termite damage. It was a thorough inspection (looked at every room and into the attic space) and he offered tiered multiple options (local, enhanced, & full tent treatments) increasing from $ -> $$. He was courteous and knowledgeable, and provides concern to treat an issue rather than upsell u on the most expensive treatment options. Customer service goes a long way so he definitely left a good impression on me.<//Text>

There are so many pest control businesses these days. But just because someone is licensed to spray poison in and around your home, it doesn’t mean that they deserve your money.
Pro Pacific Pest Control offers competitive prices...but most importantly they offer the best customer service that I’ve received from any other business ever.<//review>

Pro Pacific responded promptly to my online registration. Jeff provided details of the service, scheduled a same day appointment and emailed a copy of the contract. James arrived during the scheduled time and met with my husband who commented very positively on James' service. He signed the contract, paid $80 and now we feel secure that Pro Pacific will take care of our pest control needs in the future. We are very pleased with our decision to choose Pro Pacific.< /review>

<review>We were very impressed at how thorough and effective Pro Pacific and our rep, Richard was at relieving our attic from rat infestation!  They came four weeks in a row to check the traps and remove any rats.  They also offered to fix all our vents so the problem wouldn’t re-occur. We would definitely call on them again but hope there will be no need!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Yesterday ants were everywhere! Now today they're all gone already! 👍 After getting really expensive quotes from other companies I was extremely happy to find Pro Pacific offered such an affordable rate. I was even more happy with the service when Jason, the technician showed up. He was very professional and thorough. He explained everything in detail when I asked him about the service and the chemicals used. He assured me that it was safe for my 3 1/2 year old. He was very knowledgeable. I highly recommend their services. They even knocked down all of the spider webs in and around my house.</Text>

Super reliable service, and no ant problems! I have a young child and dog, so I didn't want to use a service with toxic chemicals. The botanical spray they use is essential oils and harmless to people and pets.< /Review>

Called different places , although I did not get an exact quote from customer service  (unlike other companies that I called) yet I found the Pro Pacific's explanation to be more truthful so I gave them a try , Anthony showed up, very accurate in his performance,  friendly and caring. I ended up with a very fair price even better than what other companies that had quoted me over the phone. I even had a text and phone call from Anthony about what else I should watch out for.
Thank you Anthony.< /text>

I am thus far quite pleased with my Pro Pacific Pest Control experience. My first telephone contact to arrange service was very easy and an appointment for the first house visit was set for a few days later. Jordan arrived with a smile and described the service he would complete; he was happy to answer all my questions. He was certain to reinforce the company policy for no cost return visits for any special problems that might occur prior to the next scheduled visit. A follow up customer service telephone call came a day later to make certain I was satisfied with my experience. On the basis of my initial experience, I highly recommend PPP Control.<//Text>

I Came home to over 3000 bees 🐝 in my living room— coming through my chimney. I called terminex as I have several services with them and they could not help me. I was referred to pro pacific by a friend and within two hours Justin was at my home and quickly make the problem go away. They saved my weekend and I wouldn’t hesitate to use them again! They were also very professional and fairly priced. Could not have asked for more!</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Do not even consider this company as an option.  They have absolutely no regard for customer satisfaction.  I have been in the customer service industry for over 25 years and this is the first time I have had to deal with a company less concerned about the customers’ satisfaction.  We have used other pest control companies and had no problems with pests for up to a year.  When I called them and told them the ants were back, they said we were 20 days over our 30 day warranty. I told them that they did not inform me prior to their visit that we would have to leave the premises for 2 hours. I have children.  I cannot just pick up and go at a moment’s notice. The guy did a sloppy, hurried process and left me worrying about the effect it would have on my kids.  He backtracked and said that we didn't really need to vacate.  It was just a precaution. (really?)  We paid $185 for them to fumigate our house.  When I told them that less than 2 months was unacceptable, they told me my only option was to get on a quarterly plan for 1 year for $98 every 3 months.  Can you believe that? The person told me that was all she could do.  I was so pissed; I told her we would not do business with them anymore. Her response was sorry, that's the best we can do. You would think that a business truly concerned about customer satisfaction would have tried a little harder to retain our business.  From being in the business of customer satisfaction, I know that 87% of customers who have a bad experience will not only return to the business, but will tell as many people as possible about their experience.  So there you go.  Do business with this company at your own expense, and I do mean expense in the most literal way.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Excellent job with customers and removing attic rats. On time and proficient at closing entry into the home. Professional business as well as affordable. They will also come out on weekends and during holidays. That's great customer service.

Ezekial, your pest control specialist who serviced our home Jan 10 was just terrific. He was polite and let me know exactly what he was going to do. It was a pleasure dealing with him. He's a wonderful representative for your company!  Also I haven't seen an ant or spider since the first time you sprayed last year. Thanks Pro Pacific!<//review>

<review>Pro Pacific has great prices in comparison to competitors. On time and quick when it comes to rodent removal and retrapping. Thorough job done on walk through by both the 1st and 2nd representative who came out. The reason I did not give 5 stars is because the 1st rep who came out had poor follow through. We go an estimate that was not clear. No call back when requested.  The second gave us an estimate before he left and has met every appointment on time within hours suitable to us.

I have been a Pro Pacific customer for over a year. I live in a gated community, {an Association,} and for several years my parents and I were using the exterminator that the Association had hired. They were fine for a while, then they {my parents }became dissatisfied with them; so we stopped using them.
Fast forward several years later...I  am living alone now, and one day last June, I was in my bedroom, and I noticed two rows of ants crawling down the wall over by the window. So I thought "That's it, I'm calling the exterminator."  The first call I placed was to the Association, but they told me they no longer provide exterminator service. Went online to see what was out there. I knew I did not want to go with Orkin or Terminex, because they are nationwide, and have enough business. I wanted to support someone local, specifically in the town where I live, {which I think they do have a "branch." }
They came out, and like others have commented, they were friendly knowledgeable, they didn't make me feel pressured into making a decision. {I put that pressure on myself, because I so desperately wanted to have the ants gone!}  and did not make you feel like any question you asked was a stupid one! I also appreciated their price. {I will be honest, Pro Pacific was the first place I called,} but I am still satisfied with the job, and professionalism they provide.</Text>

< Review>
We were in an epic battle against a never-ending army of ants that had raged for several days. At first it was a few ants and we easily got rid of them. Then more would show up but we did the same thing. There were times we thought we won only to soon realize that we in over our heads as more and more ants kept showing up.

So I Yelped an extermination company and several dozen popped up. I read tons of reviews and requested quotes using Yelp's feature. All of them responded but their approach varied and didn't come off friendly, professional,  or knowledgeable. As a matter of fact, some people were pretty vague. They would say things like, "it depends" or "we need to have someone come out to inspect" or "we don't service that area" even though their office was less than 5 miles from our home.

Pro Pacific Pest Control was the outlier. I called after 6 p.m. knowing that they were closed according to Yelp hoping that someone would answer. And Mike did! He was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. He was not vague in the least. On the contrary, he explained their services and pricing and even recommended one based on what I told him.

He said he would have someone come out the next morning between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and James showed up at 10:15 a.m. He even called to let me know when he was on his way. James was very cool and friendly. He did a great job explaining how and why he was treating certain areas for the ants and other pests like silverfish and wasps. Sadly he works in the Inland Empire so we won't see him again. I hope that the next technician is just as great. I'm fairly certain based on the service from Mike and James that I will be satisfied.

As far as the ants are concerned, they became like Houdini. Poof! All gone. The next day I saw dead crickets around the house and a few spiders, too. I am extremely satisfied with the experience so far and as long as the service continues, it should remain this way.</Review>

I was overrun by ants and called ProPacific.  They booked for the very next day in the morning, which was a total relief.  The tech was polite & efficient.  Immediately afterwards, there were NO ANTS.  I am thrilled.  Thank you so much for the excellent service!< /Text>

Pro pacific did an awesome job on the first day out of our service agreement. Everyone was great since onboarding to our technician, Zacarias, who took the time to explain the process of getting rid of our outdoor ants and spider issues. I will take advantage of having them come out again for the free of charge retreatment since it can take a couple times to eliminate the outdoor activity. Thank you.<//Text>

<review>This company was referred to me by a coworker of mine after I meantioned I was looking for a routine service for insect control around the house. I signed up for their quarterly service based off their reviews and great pricing. Fast forward a few months and it turns out we have a rodent problem that unfortunately wasn’t taken care of prior to purchasing our house. I called up Pro Pacific Pest Control and explained the situation. They sent out Gao to do a thorough inspection of the house, explain to me his findings and recommend the best course of action to take. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable and I did not feel pressured into any service, he simply weighed the pros and cons of having the service he recommended vs not. I went with the trapping service followed by a full house sealing that comes with a 2 year warranty. They set traps throughout the house and for 3 weeks came to check on them, even coming more frequently when I noticed a trap had been sprung and I didn’t want the house to smell of dead rodents due to the heat, all with no fuss or hassle and free of charge. The final stage was a full house seal, where they spend the day sealing up every nook and cranny of the house, places I couldn’t even imagine a rodent using to enter. Yanky and Raul were my sealers and they went above and beyond. They showed me the places that were going to be sealed and how they were going to do it, even explaining WHY they were doing it and the reason it needed to be done a specific way. Pro Pacific Pest Control is a great company to have a service with and you can always expect great customer service and friendly contractors at your door. A big thank you again to Gao, Yanky and Raul for making this bad situation (rodents) into a better one. My family and I can sleep a little better now knowing the house is rodent free and knowing we have a great warranty on the service we purchased.< /review>< Pics>

Went in to see if my vacuum that I had purchased was under warranty, I was about to walk out after I was told that it only had a limited warranty and as I was walking out ... I believe it was the manager a tall thin guy.. very respectful, very customer service oriented stop me and told me to let him see what he can do for me.. he checked to see if they had it in stock and then he told me that he really appreciated my business and that he was going to be able to help me with the exchange... I'm not going to lie .. I was really impress in the way he handle it but most important the way he made me feel as a valued customer.. this is the autozone where I do all my business and I have to say ever since this manager started working at this location I've seen a lot of changes around the customer experience.. I want to say his name is Frank based off all other reviews... Tall, thin, clean cut and carries himself well... Just want to say that this person is a great asset to the company and is always a great experience since he's been at this location when I do my shopping here.</Review>

Daniel R., a good humored and helpful employee checked my battery and alternator and explained all the processes needed to make sure the car would run well. In the end, it showed the battery was the problem and then directed me to a battery needed for the car: which I purchased.

<review>I walked in to this store last week and the manager was very rude and unprofessional. I asked her for her name and title and she responded by saying "I am the store manager you don't need to know my name."
It all began I asked a question regarding the "price match guaranteed". I showed the "manager" a price that I had found on Amazon for the same part at a lower advertised price. She became very agitated by the question (I still don't understand why.) and tried to find a reason not to honor the price match. 1) She said it has to be the exact same item and item number, which it was. 2) That they would add the shipping charges to the total amount, which was free. 3) That it could be free shipping due to Amazon prime subscription, which it was not. Then she said "well it sound like a better deal you should order it from Amazon because I'm not going to price match." When I asked for a reason she said she didn't have time to be explaining.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Through out the years this has been my go to Auto Zone out of many around my area this would be the only one I come too reason why for there’re costumer service,attentive,friendly and always going out of they’re way to help a customer out my husband couldn’t bring my car so I came with my 2 children not knowing what to order and how to place the item I bought for my car Elizabeth store manager withou asking me went out of her way and offered many products that I actually needed and helped with my purchase then came along employee Franky C. Amazing amazing amazing extremely thankful he didn’t have to place the lights I needed he gratefully stated it’s ok it’s service free of charge I felt so bad because I didn’t bring any tips but he made me feel comfortable and said it’s ok to not worry it’s he’s job and he’s more than happy to help me. This auto zone made a good choice having these 2 people working here helping our community when needed. Once again thank you team auto zone for helping me today I appreciate it !!!!!< /Text>

The manager explained there are different types for different cars and what not to mix in regards to Dexron VI..He confirmed by reading out loud the back of the product. I thanked him so much..I needed this product to go to work tomorrow!!  Wished I caught his name! Again, thank you!< /text>< Gmap_id>

My radiator just popped and started leaking as I was crossing the imperial hwy bridge. So I took it to autozone since it was on my way and near. They helped me a lot! I changed the whole radiator and some popped hoses. Thanks to one of the worker's who helped me change it and guiding me and loaning me some tools and a water tray to mix the antifreeze!<//review>

(Translated by Google) I went again and it seems that the ladies who work there just go mad and when they see a client they get more angry.
If you do not know very well what the piece is called that you occupy, do not go to this place because they will make you have a bad time

(Original)
Volvi a ir y parece q las senoras q trabajan ahi solo pasan enojadas y cuando ven a un cliente se enojan mas.
Si no sabes muy bien como se llama la pieza q ocupas no vallas a este lugar por q te van hacer pasar un mal rato<//Text>

Have found some great gems here. Like all thrift stores, it can be slightly hit or miss.

I like this store and never had any problems with the staff and as for the prices they're pretty similar to other stores I've been to (some same or more expensive) but it's cause of the area where is located I guess. They have a good DVD section which is why go there often.< /Review>

I've donated in the past and I've had to call numerous times for a receipt. I was about to go donate more today and called to ask about my receipt for my last donation a few months ago.The lady told me they stopped e-mailing receipts a year ago. I told her it was less than a year ago and she said I'm supposed to do a self-evaluation and hung up on me.

The best customer service ever.

I'll never give them a dime again. I should offer to donated my time and train their staff to be nicer.

AMEN!</Text>

Halloween haven!! Everything you need to host a party, create a costume, grab a packaged costume, decorate inside or outside and all at a fraction of what you would pay elsewhere. They even have brand new (unused) merchandise. New stuff gets put out every day too, so you never know what goodies you'll find!<//text>

Wonderful cause, RUDE staff. We were shocked by the treatment of people inside the stores. We will be back when the staff is new or have improved attitudes. Our donations will now go elsewhere.<//Text>

This place is a joke. First of all it is called National Council Of Jewish Women and fully ran by Hispanics. Also they charge the same price if not more than things cost brand new at a department store. The worst part is that during all three of the times I have visited this store I felt like I was being attacked by dust mites and had to go straight home to bathe. I do not reccomend this store to anyone!!!!</text>

<text>You can find some incredible deals on unique items. But be careful because the shipping cost can add quite a bit and then it's no longer a good deal. But it's fun and for a great cause so who cares, right!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>I love this thrift store! Yes, their prices are higher than Goodwill and Salvation Army stores but the quality is much higher and well worth the expense if you are a discerning shopper. I especially appreciate that they hang the jeans by approximate size so that I don't have to look at every pair to find the plus sizes. They frequently have buy two get one free sales so I love to shop with a friend and split the savings.<//Text>< user>

Clean and organized thrift shop. The prices here are higher than other stores like Goodwill but the quality also tends to be higher. Expect to find some designer brands mixed in, and lots of interesting pieces. They offer returns on clothing only, for a few days after purchase if you keep your receipt. Note that you will receive store credit, not cash or refund.

The biggest downside is that there are no fitting rooms. If they changed that I would give them 5 stars.< /Review>

<Text>Quick in n out. Decent small thrift shop. I always surprised that I tend to keep finding designer dress shirts her. A better shop for clothes as the trinkets and other area is pretty small.<//Text>< Pics>

It's the best donation place.  You drop off the items, they issue you a receipt, about one or two weeks later you receive another receipt with accurate estimate of the donation value.  Neither Salvation Army nor Goodwill will do this for you!< /review>

The big drawback of this store is that they don't have a changing room.  They give you two days to return the merchandise but who wants to do that?  The store is fairly well organized. I felt the workers were disinterested.  I've been to their shop on Fairfax and the workers are way more helpful. Metered street parking only. It is highly unlikely I will go back to this store.<//review>

<text>Worst customer service today. Because there's no fitting room, you're forced to buy and then try on at home. Bought some jeans, were to small, exchanged for another pair... those were to big. Went back to exchange again, already a massive hassle. And they wound not let me exchange again. Saying you can only exchange one time. And that is not listed anywhere. There is a sign saying you only have 3 days to exchange but nothing on the one exchange policy. And it's not like I was asking cash back, just for another exchange. What kind of customer service is that to deny it?  What's the reasoning?  Manager just said, that's the policy! I've been in customer service along time and this just blew my mind. I've been going to this thrift store 2/3 a month and now will never return. I ended up just leaving my already paid for jeans that were to big there, no use for them. Thanks a lot people.

The items are indeed overpriced, and not the best of any thrift store I've been in. I do donate to them, but don't get anything. One good thing about donating is that they send you an actual valuation for your donation and are quite generous with their estimates.
The one good thing I've gotten there is wine glasses: we are extremely hard on our glassware, and I pick them up there for about $1.00 a glass.
There is a thrift store on Washington Blvd. across the street from the Sony studios which is outstanding: check that one out. I got a $395.00 pair of Arche boots for $10.00. I doubt they were worn more than once or twice. Their stuff is amazing...< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>5/7/2016 - Recently visited this go to location of the Council Thrift Shop and the cashier was sooooo rude. Generally speaking this is not the 1st time they've conducted themselves this way. The cashier accused me of changing price tags on two simple white vases that I purchased. The thing is...there was a group of 4, had I changed the tag on them ALL why wouldn't I buy them all. After I brought this to her attention, she stated that ppl change tags all the time and she'd priced them earlier at double the price. This was sooo surrealing to me. I won't patronize this shop any longer.

Purchased 3 large/extra long scarves and a shorter one. Only complaint is that pricing isn't consistent...Eric is very helpful and always willing to meet you halfway on pricing of most items.  This location is much more affordable than their Hollywood location.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ba5c8dd8df9b:0x9bee1e59a63b723c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>After getting rear ended my insurance company sent me to fix Auto for my repairs. Which I am glad they did. The whole process was easy which took a lot of stress off of me. They called for my rental as soon as I arrived and had me in and out in no time. Gloria is very nice and knowledgeable. She gave me the break down of what was needing to be fixed and also gave me suggestions on other body work I was interested in. She was easy to talk to and trustworthy. They also kept me updated in the progress of my car and finished when they said they would:)  I had no worries leaving my car in their hands. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and would use them again if needed.</Text>< Pictures>

This was my first choice to go for an estimate for my truck. First off, I didn’t know I had to have an appointment to get an estimate. Secondly, I wasn’t sure what the damages would be so I didn’t want to  take out an insurance claim if I didn’t have to. Basically, I was told that if I didn’t want to go through my insurance then they couldn’t help me. Who ever heard of such a thing? The next follow up question I should have been asked was if I would like to get an estimate in case I do want to go through my insurance? I felt very put off. Then he told me that as far as he knew, there was no one around that would give me an estimate without reporting to insurance. The very next place I went to gave me an estimate without an appointment and gave me the choice of paying out of pocket or reporting to my insurance. I reported it to my insurance. I only like to give 5 star reviews but this one still has me annoyed over a month later as it was 3/1/21 when I went in there. A little customer service goes a long ways!</Text>

Epitome of what you hope to experience when you turn your car in for repairs. I've lived in 3 different major cities in the US and have not always had great luck with cars or repair shops. Fix Auto Modesto is far and away the best service shop I've ever experienced. Extremely professional, thoughtful, and considerate of their consumers. I wish all repair shops were like this!<//Review>

Was very happy with the bodywork and paint work they did for my truck. I could not tell where it had been wrecked. They kept me informed on the progress of my truck. They were done 4 days ahead of my finished date. Very professional, polite, and friendly. My truck was spotless when I picked it up. They walked me through everything that they had done to fix my truck. I would highly recommend them to work on your vehicle.<//Review>

Accidentally smashed one of my side mirrors, and found the part I needed online, but was unsure on how to install it. Luckily, the friendly staff at Fix Auto Modesto, was more than willing to install said part, and the best part is they did it for free. Fast service, and stellar customer service, I highly recommend them.< /review>

The staff was professional and courteous. The lobby was one of nicest auto body repair shops I have ever been in. The whole process of dropping off my car and how the staff engaged Hertz to pick me up for rental car process was stellar. Well run Business. I will recommend to family and friends.</Review>

I have used this body shop 3 times now. They have changed their name to fix auto. Every time I have been here. The work they have done for me was excellent some of the other things I like about this place is how quick they repair my car. And I like the text messages telling when my car will be ready. From the manager to crew working on my car to the ladies in the office. They are very professional< /review>

<Review>Hands down this business is outstanding!  Not only are they professional, friendly, and do an amazing job, they keep you posted and explain what they are doing! Israel was wonderful along with the receptionists who treat customers as though they are valued clients.  The work was supposed to take 4 days to complete; however, I received a text and a phone call notifying me that the repairs would be finished the next day.  When I picked up my car, it was washed and cleaned inside and out!  I would highly recommend Fix Auto Modesto to anyone who needs to have repairs completed on their cars.  Their work is guaranteed for the life of the car! Amazing!!< /Review>< pictures>

Let's face it. No one likes dealing with the aftermath of a accident.But the Fix Auto team made the repair process so smooth& easy.
You can rest assure that your car will be repaired with the most highest standards.
They did a wonderful job and I highly  recommend  them.</review>

I needed to have body work done on new Dodge Ram Longhorn after accident with boat.  Quick estimate, immaculate work done quickly.  Professional office staff who went above and beyond to set up rental, have it ready and to return it from their shop after we picked up our repaired truck.  Truck was spotless inside and out when returned.  Israel explained all steps before and after plus we got daily updates on progress.  Don’t think I could imagine any improvement in service. Thank you so much< /text>

From the first day that booked our appointment to the day that we picked up our completed car, we have received white glove service. They have great communication and have provided updates all along the way. They really took the stress of our car accident away.  They made us feel like our car was in great hands. Then we picked up the car. That's when they really showed us how a customer should be treated and confirmed that our car really was in great hands! If we ever need body work again, you will be our first choice and we will share our experience with all of our family and friends. Thanks again!<//text>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience at fix Auto in Modesto. from the moment when I walked in,the young man  at the front desk greeted me and was so professional. Everybody I came in contact with that day was professional and courteous. Even the young lady who dropped the rental car off was so polite.I only wish I could give more than five stars they deserve a lot more than that, keep up the good work guys You're the best.< /Text>< user_id>

Outstanding work done by a great professional staff. We had to have a rear hatch and bumper replaced on our Tahoe due to being rear ended. Fix auto kept us up to date throughout the experience through texts. Paint matched great and we received our vehicle in better condition than the day we had bought it. Could not be more pleased with our experience with this shop and would recommend it to anyone.< /text>

Fix Auto did a great job in fixing my van! The whole experience was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful! They kept me informed throughout the whole process on the progress of the job. And to my suprise upon picking up my van they had completely detailed the inside which was amazing!!<//Review>

<Text>The work was good, they were handicapped by my insurance company. They wanted to redo the whole car the way it should be, but the work they did do was very nice and they detailed the car after to give that shine you want.< /Text></record>

Overall a great experience!! I like that they send texts to keep you up to date with your car's progress, I am so happy and grateful they were able to work with my schedule so that I was able to pick up my car! Will definitely be back if I ever need to and will recommend to family & friends! Thank you once again to Bobby and Fix Auto for everything! 😄</Review>

<Text>I went here because they were already known to my insurance when I got into a front end accident,  just expecting a regular auto shop.  This place is fire 🔥 . They did all the repairs in just a few days,  exactly as long as they estimated,  and when my wife and I came to pick it up,  they offered to install a new battery free of charge ( my battery was whack before I dropped it off) the staff was super nice,  understanding,  patient,  all that.  If I ever derp and wreck any of my rides again,  I know where I'm going.  Mother Effin Fix auto.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

My car was recently towed to Fix (I chose from online reviews) after I was t-boned by a red light runner.  They were all extremely kind and courteous, and they handled everything very promptly and professionally. I see why my insurance carrier and others use their services!  Thanks, Fix Auto Modesto!! 😘< /Text>

Israel and his team did a great job fixing the damage on my Acura left by a hit and run. Not only did he replace the damage but he also made sure that any previous dings/marks were taken care of as well. My car was done within 2 days, a week ahead of the estimated time. I will make sure I recommend Fix Auto to friends and family from now on!<//Review>

Got rear ended on a Thursday, they accepted the car later that day and had it ready on Saturday. Work was clean, looks like it never happened. As a bonus, they detailed the car. As an extra bonus, they did the inside too, which had an incredible amount of dog fur. Top notch work.<//Review>

I had such a great experience with Fix Auto Modesto. Having an auto accident is always a terrible thing to happen. But after talking with everyone at Fix Auto Modesto, all my concerns and worries about getting my car fixed were put at ease. Very professional and friendly staff with a very clean and professional facility. I highly recommend Fix Auto Modesto to anyone needing auto collision repairs. Thank you Fix Auto Modesto for all your help!

Sincerely,
F.R.< /Text>

car was supposed to be done in 10 days but they finished it 2 days early !! Front desk, Bebe was very helpful and cooperative !! She kept me updated on how long my vehicle would take to be completely repaired. Along with Marshall who made sure all repairs to my vehicle was completely fixed. Overall, if you need your vehicle repaired, this is definitely the place !!<//review>

<review>I would highly recommend this shop. The service was great and the employees were so friendly. Getting in an accident is stressful enough as it is but they took the stress off of you. They update you everyday on the progress of your vehicle. They work very quickly. We are extremely happy and satisfied with everything.</review>< pictures>

As soon as I walked through the front door I was greeted and treated with kind friendliness and respect (which goes a long way with me), the attention to detail the guys in the shop put into every little thing and to call me if they had a question about anything. The quality of job put forth by these guys and in the time frame they were able to do it in is, quite simply, impressive. It kind of felt like I was buying my car for the first time. Definitely going to keep there number because Fix Auto of Modesto will have all of my future business. Thank you to Krish and the crew for taking excellent care of me and my car.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>This is the best auto repair experience I’ve ever had. They were professional, courteous, quick, efficient and very personable. They made this the most painless process possible. I particularly liked the text updates, for the repair progress and any estimate modifications. They also called as well.
I would definitely use them again, & recommend them to anyone.</Review>< user_name>

The workmanship is amazing. They fixed my bumper and match the red perfectly.  Very friendly and  thorough service. The receptionist was a pleasure to deal with.  The office kept in touch with updates the whole time they had my car.
Thank you for your pleasant service.<//Text>

I was extremely impressed with the attention and dedication that my vehicle received. Isreal and Bobbi were professional and kept an open line of communication throughout my car's stay at the shop. They kept me in the loop by phone and by text and Isreal offered to stay late in order to accommodate my work schedule when dropping and picking up my vehicle. I am appreciative of their customer service and was pleasantly surprised to find that my car had been cleaned inside and out. I will use then again if ever needing my vehicle to be repaired after an accident. Thank you!.</Text>

<review>First time submitting a claim, and the experience was amazing.  Fix Auto had an appointment ready for me, reviewed my damage, gave me the estimate and set up the rental to come get me right then and there. Got back my car few days later. Looked great!!

I started out concerned and skeptical but they completely turned it around.  The work was done professionally, early, and below estimated cost.  I don’t think you can ask for more than that.  While their process was really different than anything I had experienced previously, you can’t argue with the results.  My car looks great!<//Text>

This is my second time taking my vehicle to Fix Auto. The staff is very courteous and pleasant to work with especially Phoebe and Mickey. They do an excellent job on car repairs and care. If anything should happen again to my vehicle  (hopefully not lol) i know that I and my car will be in good hands! You guys rock! And Mickey is the best! ;)<//text>

After finding out that our car was totaled, we didn’t know what hoops we’d have to jump through to get taken care of. Fix Auto and Gieco Auto Insurance partnered together to make this a quick and seamless transaction. Staff was ultra hospitable and informative. Office was clean and comfortable. Not that I hope to be in this situation again, but if I am ...Fix Auto has my business.<//text>

<text>I had an amazing experience with Fix Auto. They were very professional, their offices are very clean and everything went amazing. I walked in, had my estimate done, not expecting to leave my car there that day. Front office staff was very polite and helpful. As well as the gentleman who did the estimate. They were ready to take my vehicle that day, and also set up my rental car while I was there. They set up my ride, rental car, and text me throughout the whole experience to let me know when my car would be ready. Then at the end, they returned my rental car for me as well.

Fix Auto did an outstanding job on fixing our GMC Terrain - We were rear-ended and significant damage was done, but Mickey and his crew  made our 2017 Terrain look "new" again !

Had a great experience with Fix Auto. Erika & Bobby made the experience such a breeze and were very friendly. Great work done on my car and was completed quickly. I would definitely come back to Fix Auto and recommend them to anyone who needs work done on their cars. Thank you.</Review>

They were all friendly and kept me updated on the status of my vehicle. It was done by the day and time I was told. Did a good job on my vehicle and gave it back to me cleaner than I gave it to them. I highly recommend Fix Auto Modesto< /text>

Fix it was very easy to work with. They are detail oriented as they explain the process. They are quick to update you on the vehicle status especially if anything has changed. Staff is very friendly< /text>

Fix Auto was not only extremely friendly, they did excellent work in a timely fashion. I was panicked because my disability makes renting a car difficult, so I asked Fix Auto if they can possibly have my car ready before I have to go back to work. It was a tight time window to complete the job, but they made it happen. Overall, my experience with Fix Auto was wonderful. I would highly recommend them for your auto repair needs.< /Text>

After expressing my concern that I was supposed to be leaving out of town the following weekend I asked them to try really hard to have my car done before I left so I could take it on my trip. The day of my trip I got a call saying that my car would not be ready for me to take, but that they would like to offer to pay for a rental car for me to take instead. This is something I never asked for and never expected. It was so kind and a great way to start my trip. Thank you Fix Auto Modesto, Bobby and Bebe. You guys are amazing.< /text>< Pics>

The only thing wrong with the airbox was an intake tube and mount, nothing was wrong with the air filter. The original air bix box even had a sticker on it stating that the air filter was not to be replaced and they still replaced it. Now I'm waiting for a call from a manger to see what if anything they are going to do about it.

UPDATE: Manager called and is buying a new filter to replace the one they removed. Offered to replace it without me asking. Aside from this issue service has been great.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

I was re-ended and mad. I went to Fix Auto and from beginning to end they stepped me through their process and updated me on my alerts. Explained where the damage was and where the repairs will be done on my auto. In the end I got my car a day before was projected and handed me my keys and car back waaaay better than it looked before I brought it in. They went above and beyond for my car and did right by me.</review>

I recommend this company to anyone with vehicle issues . Fix Auto is an organization that takes the time to listen to you first and then walks you through the process of getting your car repaired .
Fix Auto takes pride in taking care of you.< /review>

This company/employees were very friendly and did great work. The day I was supposed to pick up my car they noticed something else that needed to be replaced, called me when they found it and informed me it would be an extra day. When getting my car back not only did it look great on the outside they also detailed the inside of the car.< /review>

<review>Used Fix Auto to repair a hole in my bumper and a scratch on the side of my car. Had great customer service! I had gotten quotes from several local body shops and they were comparable to all of the shops price wise but they used all new Toyota parts and seemed very reputable. My car was done a day early, it was right on target with the quote they had given me and it looks great! Would recommend for any body repairs!</review>< pics>

<Review>This shop exceeded my expectations (twice). I brought in my car through geico after an accident and Fix Auto made the process so easy! They set me up with a rental car on site and always had text updates letting me know how my repairs were going. They were on time with repairs and I picked up my car with all of the repairs fixed and they even detailed my car! Then a few weeks later an issue came up that I assumed was related to the accident as well. I brought it back and was setup with a rental car again and all of the repairs were taken care of. They were amazing start to finish! Would highly recommend!!</Review><Time>1553455341013</Time><rate>5</rate><GmapID>0x809050d07659e833:0xbd08942207eb39ba<//GmapID><userid>101333180320833271796< /userid></record></dataset><record>

It doesn’t get any better than this! The staff is extremely professional and kind, they keep you updated the entire time, plus they do an amazing job on the car itself! I can not recommend this place enough! Please do not hesitate to come here! In fact, when I went to go get an estimate at another place, they were going to charge $500 more than what fixauto charged me! I usually don’t leave reviews but this place was worth taking the time to write one.< /Review>

I brought in my Range Rover. Excellent service provided by Bobbie, Krish, and Bebe(at the front desk). Fix auto is the place to go if you want great customer service. Thanks Fix Auto.<//Review>

I could say this was one of the best experiences ive had dealing with auto body shops. I showed up at the scheduled time and they were prompt on addressing my situation.
Thoroughly went over my truck addressed what he could see and informed me once the front bumper,grill was off they could see more and would let me know any additional issues. Once off there was a couple more brackets needed, but forseen due to the experience of my new found friend " Mickey". Their stright up front with you. No beating around the bush type of body shop. Thats what Modesto needs more of. I want to send a shout out to Fixed Auto you guys know what your doing. Thank You.< /review>

I was being treated so amazing that I wasn’t even thinking or even worrying about how my car would turn out! Which did turned out astonishing! Truly better than when I originally bought it! The work put into it and the attention to detail was incredible! It truly exceeded my expectations! I went on google and simply typed in “best body shop in Modesto” and Fix Auto came up, I read the reviews and I was convinced that this was the place I needed to take my car. The other main reason was that they guarantee their job for life as long as you own the vehicle. Boby is the MAN! he really made sure that my expectations were met but he went far and beyond in the detail of my car or even being very knowledgeable in his line of work to be able to explain in detail any and all questions I had! Once again, thanks Boby! Bebe and Erika at the front desk were also super nice and friendly! Made me feel very welcome, were very knowledgeable to answer any questions on paper work or insurance stuff. They even offered a ride home or an Uber or Lyft, courtesy of Fix Auto to go pick up my car when it was ready! Like I said, exceeding all my expectations! My car was done specifically on the date I was told and when I went I was attended very promptly, the staff were all very polite and friendly! Thanks again Fix Auto! And special thanks to Boby, Bebe, and Erika.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Dr Tan had reviewed my chart before she came into the room.  Was aware that I had been in the urgent care.  She is encouraging and supportive not quick to prescribe more medications.   In partnership with me care plan was decided.< /Review>

When I first moved to SoCal my wife and I was worried that we wouldn't find a good pcp but we was wrong. Dr. Tann is the best! She is very knowledgeable about her work in the medical field. Very sincere and caring about your health. Takes the time to explain everything in detail about any of my health concerns and comes up with great solutions to the issue if there is any. I highly recommend Dr. Tann she is the best. I am so happy she is my doctor!

Also cant forget about Nurse Patricia who does a great job at helping me relax while checking my vitals by just a friendly conversation, since im the type  that gets nervous going to the doctor.

Staff is so kind, it makes your appointment feel comfortable! My doctor is so awesome and detailed! If I have a concern, they take it seriously and run exams as needed! Previous doctors I had would laugh my concerns off and suggest Ibuprofen or something basic. Not here with Dr. Tan!! I'm so pleased I switched to Memorial Care!<//text>

Dr Tan is awesome! It is obvious her professionalism and kindness is also part of her office culture, because all the nurses in there were friendly, efficient, but never made me feel rushed. This is a great doctor's office to visit. Even after, Doctor Tan always makes time to answer my questions and continues to inform and educate me on my health options.< /review>

<review>I made an appointment this morning at 9:30 am as a new patient. They scheduled me at 10am for Dr Tan. I got to the office at 10:05am. I had to fill out papers but come to find out I was already in the system due to being a patient at another location.

I was called in at 10:15am. They took my vitals and placed me in a Room where Leslie Tran asked the basic questions. She informed me that the Dr was already working with the patient directly in front of me and that I was next. I then waited over an hour until she came back in to notify me that because I was late, she had to take the patients that showed up on time. I said I understood (even though I was actually only 5min late given that I had to rush there right after I got off the phone at 9:30) 30 minutes later another lady came in to inform me another patient was there on time. I asked “should I leave? Because if patients keep coming in on time I can’t wait that long.” She just said the Dr would be with me as soon as she could. 30 more minutes passed and I decided to just leave. I had my 4 year old daughter with me and after her waiting patiently for 2 hours, I couldn’t ask her to be patient much longer. Also, how I was feeling, I surely wasn’t in the best condition to have to wait over 2 hours and not even see the doctor.

Moral of the story, if you go to this doctor, please don’t be a minute late. They have no courtesy or compassion for even new patients trying to figure out where to park, find the office and fill out necessary papers. They should not have booked me knowing I had to complete all that if they weren’t ok with even a 5 minute flexibility in their schedule.< /review>< pics>

Doctor Jenny Tan is great and her office is so well run that I have not yet experienced any waiting - in the exam room or in the waiting room.  Really efficient and we really trust Doctor Tan - she really explains things well and will have you wearing sunscreen and eating heart healthy food after her explanations of your blood panel and areas of your skin that show signs of sun damage.  Wish we had her years ago.  She is the reason why people need primary car physicians.< /Review>

I came in without an appointment and they do not take walk-in they still saw me. All of the stuff including the dr did everything to answer my questions and they were all very polite since the moment I walked in till I was out.</review>

I had the worst experience seeing Dr Tan. I have never felt so terrible meeting a Dr. in my entire life! She was cold, lacked empathy, lacked courteous bedside manners, and she made me feel like a second class citizen. She made me feel completely uncomfortable and I couldn't believe the questions she asked me that didn't relate to my health.<//review>

4 stars is specifically for the order and portions which was better then usual.  No drive thru and required exact change if using cash.

Miss the old taco bell when they didn't have dehydrated beans and their beef didn't taste like dog food. (or what I imagine dog food would taste like)

Last resort when I don't pack my lunch and there's nowhere else to go.

Or if you're drunk I suppose 🤪🤷‍♂️< /review>

Efficient and prompt service. Ordered food was as per my requirements. Since I buy food from this place for my son, he has acquired a liking for the preparation here compared to other Taco Bell locations. Staff are friendly< /review>

I ordered veggie power bowl and it literally had just one spoon of rice spread all over the bowl to make it look good, and lettuce all over to cover up ‘no rice’ with ofcourse some gauce and beans on the side. Disgusting</review>

<Review>There is NO DRIVE-THROUGH! Just a heads up in case someone was expecting otherwise. Their food is like any other taco bell, and they have automated machines you can order from which is a big plus.< /Review>< gmapID>

<username>Dell Fischer< /username><review>I like taco Bell. I customize my burritos to my specification. For instance, If you order a chicken burrito, you can delete whatever you like and add whatever you like. I like substituting the rice with lettuce and substituting the avocado cream sauce with pico de gallo. Taco Bell is not the healthiest food in the world but I do think you can make their items healthier if you desire to do that. They have an ordering kiosk but I would rather go to the counter because I'm not sure what ingredients are in each taco Bell item.  The quality of the food is just okay so I'm a little on the fence whether I should give them three stars or four stars.<//review></record>

<text>MAN I'M BLOWN AWAY !!
EXCEPTION TO THE RULE ...
I was a big fan of taco Bell I know but I was young came back to the US after 17 years gone taco Bell too expensive and little product for the buck.
I JUST ORDERED TWO PLAIN TACOS. THE YOUNG LADY AT AT THE FRONT IS A GEM TOOK MY ORDER INCLUDING MY SENIOR WHICH I DID NOT ASK FOR BECAUSE I FORGOT I JUST TURNED 55 ... NORMALLY I  WOULD BE HAPPY SIMPLY RECEIVE THE TACOS IN A TIMELY MANNER NOT ONLY DID I RECEIVE THE TACOS IN A TIMELY MANNERTHEY WERE THE BEST TACOS I'VE HAD FROM TACO BELL EVEN PRIOR TO THE DAYS THAT I LEFT IN THE MARINE CORPS YOUNG MAN OF THE BACK GET AN EXCELLENT JOB COMPLETE TACOSTHE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS PUT THIS TACO BELL AT LEAST EIGHT STARS FORGET THE 5 THEY'RE ONLY ALLOW YOU HERE I DO NOT KNOW THE YOUNG MAN'S THE ORDER#267646
KARINA J THE CASHIER GREETER SMILING FACE AND OVERALL WONDERFUL PERSON GET HER JOB SO SMOOTHLY SO QUIETLY PEACEFULLY.
I'm hoping this taco Bell has great success from this day forward to the two team members please keep it up thank you very much Sean O'Shea</text>< pics>

<review>The food is great, inexpensive, and good quality. There's a lot of variety as well. Even though the food might not be authentic Mexican food, it is still a good casual or comfortable place to go and eat.

A solid operation where the people are friendly and the food made correctly and reasonably quickly.  To get 5 stars:  Needs a drive-through, faster prep, and keep the tables cleaner.</review>

Portion sizes at Taco Bell have just gotten smaller over the years. The El Gordo Supreme is still my favorite but the standard taco supreme is also pretty good. Staff is polite and efficient. The general area is usually decently clean.< /Text>

Food's good for the most part. Nothing spectacular about it except that the store stays open late into the night. Great if there's nothing else around.<//Text>

Comfort Mexican Fast Food that's about the same as any other TB. Cheap, greasy, and super fast, it's not the place to take your loved ones, but it's open 24/7 and satisfies midnight cravings very well.<//Text>

taco bell food is the worst I have ever tasted since the no longer cook there food there , it's crap I wish they would go back to the way they used to make there own chips , beans , taco meat , that's was the best back then , I don't like the way they do it now your food is not as good as people think it is but I guess when your hungry you will eat anything, I wish taco bell would go back to the old way of preparing there own food on a day to day basis if not I would love to open my own stand and challange them to a taste test to see who is better....< /review>

Nice workers..but a 3 person line with only 3 people in front of me took 20minutes for 2 5 layers and a crunchwrap. I coulda got a mid rare steak and potatoes faster.  But very nice workers and a sexy Latina at the q.b. spot on the line 1 star for her smile ..the food was still good rhough< /Review>

Some of the best deals in town on produce, frozen, and snack food. They usually have enough help on the registers to move you through quickly. the staff is friendly, helpful, and cool. Keep a special eye out for bulk purchases at the end of their shelf life- you'll save a fortune and most of that stuff is good well past expiration (except meat and dairy. Stay healthy!)</text>

I discovered Grocery Outlet about 7 years ago. I tend to shop at Walmart, Smart and Final and 99 cents store as I'm on a budget. What I love is their healthy options and their wine selection. I have gotten some awesome wines for $3.99! They sometimes don't have what you might consider the basic items. For instance today I was looking for peppercorns but they didn't have any. I will definitely continue to shop here!</review>

Bargain basement grocery store.  No frills, except deals.  Great wine and beer selections.  Cheap prices.  Only wish they had even more stuff.</review>

< Review>
My girlfriend and I had just finished tearing down an ancient wooden shed in the backyard of a house we recently bought.  We were looking pretty rugged.  My girlfriend asked if they might have a restroom she could use.  After a long, lascivious look up and down her the manager said "not for homeless we do not" (while his eyes remained glued to her chest). Offended, (not at being called homeless...but by his attitude) she went outside. Now the guy follows me - literally 3 steps behind - throughout the store.  And he smelled REALLY bad.  This place's service SUCKS!!<//Review>

Great spot, a little crowded.  The food is good but could use a little more flavor and a little more German love.  The Jaeger Schnitzel was a little dry and the spatzle lacked as well.  Atmosphere is great though like a German guesthouse.  You do feel rushed though as they want to quickly turn over tables.</review>

I came in looking for a certain canned food item. They had the item at a price equal to the best prices I saw in two other places. I'll be back again. Parking was easy and close. Only one person ahead of me at checkout. The store is clean and uncluttered. I like the idea of supporting a locally owned store.<//text>

Best deals in town if you are open to what's in stock. Lots of organic options. Best prices in town for cheeses and cold cuts. The wine section offers huge discounts use your vino wine app to ensure you get the best ones. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Love that it's not too big and easy to navigate.<//Text>

I have heard good things about these places, so since we were fairly nearby my wife and I decided to check it out.  They do have decent prices, but of course you need to know what the items would cost regularly to be able to tell exactly how good a deal you are getting. We have a nearby Frazier Market that always has great prices on produce, and my wife said their prices are about the same for fruits and veggies. They also get a few interesting vegan items, but from what I understand it is kind of hit-or-miss. If you have one of these Grocery Outlets near you it is probably great, but I don't think I would want to do a long drive just to find out they don't have much that I am interested in. Today they had a few vegan ice creams at great prices, so I was a happy camper.  As others have said, they do have a decent selection of wines. There is also plenty of parking, and the store personnel seemed friendly enough.</Text>

<review>Fantastic amount of savings however if you like specific brands and high variety of options in a singular visit it may not provide that for you.  The brands and items that they carry tend to change often but you can't beat the pricing. It is a GREAT place to shop at if you are willing and wanting to try something new for a great price.</review>< Pics>

Many people have said negative things about Grocery Outlet I don't have anything negative to say. I have found so many great deals! I am one to do lots of crock pot cooking. And they sell a pork roast and I believe it's less than $7. I buy three or four of these a month and do pulled pork sandwiches, pork burritos, and anything else that soft pork can be put into. Their wine selection is great and so is there alcohol. And there's always a good deal! I love reading how much I've saved at the end of my transaction.< /text>

You never know what good bargains you will find. They have a pretty diverse wine selection. The only reason that I don't give 5 stars is sometimes I can't find what I need so I have to go to another grocery store.< /text>

You'll find great one of a kind deals here in every department. Huge wine selection so you have to come check it out if you like wine. You're sure to find something you'll love. They sell produce and dairy products. You'll find some cosmetics and skin care products, school supplies, and games and toys.< /Review>

Good bargains so if you see anything you like, buy in bulk because it might not be there tomorrow. Some items one shot deal. Always check your dates on perishable products. Wine deals galore. Great yogurt deals too.</text>

<text>Grocery outlet has a great, yet always rotating selection of healthy food at crazy low prices. Lots of gluten free, organic, and whole food options in fresh, frozen and shelf varieties. The store is not pretty or even inviting. The staff is friendly. If you're not familiar with the shopping center, it's not the best at night. Daytime feels safe but it's pretty seedy at night.< /text><userid>113766207301523521135< /userid>< Response>

They carry a lot of organic products, you just have to keep an eye out for them. They are like other discount places in that an item you like may not be there every time you go.</text>< pics>

<Review>So they have good prices on a lot of items that are close to expiration and super wine steals. But the store can be a mess sometimes and their new bag or backpack policy is ridiculous. I had my laptop bag since my car is a jeep. And I was escorted out due to not wanting to give up my bag with a $1500 laptop. The staff is 50/50 the asst MGR or whoever made me leave had a very bad attitude. If you are getting wine and don't mind being treated like a criminal I recommend it.< /Review><Name>Raul Deju< /Name><rate>1</rate><GmapID>0x80dc73dee22e666f:0x177f8afba160d616</GmapID><user_id>108259778409272511053</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The grocery outlet in oceanside has wayyyy more products then the one in fallbrook. They have more of a selection too. Beware of expiration dates. A lot of the products have a very close expiration date so I presume that's why it's inexpensive. I love a great deal and I ALWAYS find one...actually A LOT of great deals/bargains here!!<//text></record>

To start off it’s thanksgiving week and there is the buy two get one free apple ciders signs on the apple cider and then my mom and I grab some because that’s what we originally went there for. Then the employees at the store tell us that it’s not valid anymore, well the sign is up so it should be valid. Then the manager comes out of no where and rips the sign off and says there’s nothing that they can do about it and it’s not valid anymore. Well I start saying that they should be able to honor it if they had the sign up and made a mistake.. that’s how things work right?? But they said “no that’s not how it works. It’s not in our system anymore.” And im like well you can override it. The sign was up. Basically the manager is a sissy and can’t do anything right, not even say kind words to a customer or explain anything nicely. I’ve been coming to this store and have been ignoring the signs of terrible customer service. So here I am. The store owners are terrible as well. People should just go to Walmart.

Went in for an interview for a job with the owners who were husband and wife.  The wife didn't want me to say the name of my last employer when answering their questions.  I guess I said WALMART too many times.  The questions were .....Tell me about a time when you performed excellent customer service in detail, Do you mind being told what to do by an 18-year manager and What would your last employer say about your work ethic.  She mentioned that her customers don't like the place and are more classy then to shop at that place.  You know which place, right?  It is the one I can't mention.   Also like to note that their workforce was clearly one nationality.< /Review>

My wife was accused of shoplifting while she was still shopping in the store all because she was using a reusable bag! They went way out of line...both owners and a manager basically rushed toward her and humiliated her and asked for their merchandise back in front of all the other shoppers.  When she told them it was a shopping bag and not her purse they did apologize, but that doesn't take back what they did.<//text>

You can find some pretty amazing deals at this market. They don't always have the same products so if you find something at a good price that you like you should stock up while they have it.< /Review>

<Text>Bought some groceries here several weeks ago & didn't pay attention to the expiration date, (my error). Took home and realized I had 1 week to eat, knew i couldn't possibly finish it by then but already had thrown out receipt. Went back to store, explained my situation of wanting to possibly return a couple of items. They said they could give me store credit, and they did! Very pleased. Almost $12 in groceries. They've kept me as a long time customer after that.<//Text>< Pics>
