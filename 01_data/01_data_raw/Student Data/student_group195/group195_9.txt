<review>This place is awesome! The flavors are amazing!!! I didn’t even know I was eating plant base sushi until I was told after I finished my dinner. I’ve been back several times and have recommended to my friends and we all agree this place is San Diego’s best kept secret. It should be on Thrillest’s top places to eat. If want to eat healthy and still enjoy the flavors of something delicious well The Village is the place to be! The owner is awesome also and she is very passionate about her food and you can taste it. I highly recommend this place to everyone who loves to eat Mexican food or Sushi.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxEOCizugNZkW9FiM0sw9C9WmLFPJsvzUhkL19=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1kxG5cik2uX1O6rZiHSwZl66ZGh5hnO3SnFKk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d955f8f9fe4d4f:0xf72512c5ba26fdfa<//GmapID></record>

<Review>The Village is my new favorite Vegan restaurant! They have a Mexican menu and a Japanese menu, all vegan. Try the chimichanga and don't forget to ask about the secret menu!< /Review>< Pictures>

Service was bad. Ordered two rolls. They took 45 minutes to get to our table. Two tables that were sat after us were served before we got our food. Server brought two items to our table that we did not order.

Female manager does not wear a mask. She hugged a customer that walked in from the street; He also was not wearing a mask. Is she refuses or is exempt from wearing a mask she needs to stay at home. She was talking over peoples food with no mask she conversed with a server.

This place is bot following the rules that will keep you safe from COVID-19.

Server was nice but didnt make up for slow service and decisions of female manager.</Text>

This business is not considerate of Covid-19 protocol:

At least two employees here (manager + chef?) do not wear masks. I have been here multiple times and seen this. They were talking closely with customers, handling money, and takeout.

When confronted and asked why they are not wearing masks, they responded that they have a respiratory / medical issue allowing them mask exempt status.

This has been thoroughly debunked by doctors- the idea that masks obstruct oxygen intake. The fact that this restaurant has employees working without masks during a pandemic is disrespectful to the many people sacrificing to reduce spread of contagion.

Avoid this restaurant at all costs if you care about masks being worn by the employees.

I would like to see the business owner's response to this situation. Are you supporting your employees not wearing masks?

Regarding Food and Service: It took 45min for a "ready in 15min" order. Considering the food experience has been average, this place is not worth the risk to your health for the benefit of the nutrition.< /review>

The restaurant is so beautiful and open inside. the menu has so many amazing things to chose from that it is difficult to make a decision. I got the calamari and the fajitas. the flavor was so delicious! I also tried their raw vegan desserts which were amazing too! Alondra and her staff were so welcoming and warm. I highly recommend trying this place. You will love it!!< /Review>

< Review>
I am sorry to give this place a bad review. It's nothing personal, I wish them success I just really didn't enjoy my experience here.

Service:
We were asked 5+ times if we were ready to order. Our server would circle around and ask after a couple minutes or so. We had a hard time deciding on what to order and felt very rushed. Not only did our server ask us multiple times but we even had another server from a different section ask us. It felt very pushy and awkward. Once we finally did order it took forever for our meal to arrive, we waited for a long time for the Verde Enchiladas.

Food:
The food looked presentable but didn't have much flavor.

Verde Enchiladas had very bland filling, sweet potato hash was lacking flavor. The rice was over cooked and mushy. The beans were soupy and again bland.

Raw Roll was ok, wasn't terrible but there was something that tasted very bitter. Flavor combination wasn't very appealing or tasty.

Sad to say I will not be returning to this restaurant.< /Review>

Absolutely incredible. Best service anywhere in San Diego. And the food? I have been a vegan for 20 years, and also gluten free — and this is hands down the best vegan food in San Diego. Alondra truly understands how to prepare food with love — and you can taste it in every bite. The lounge atmosphere and clean, sweet decor are spot on. The staff are all so efficient, happy and kind — it has the right vibe!! Everyone run here to eat — it’s delicious through and through. So many amazing combinations of flavors and the best quality organic ingredients. What a treat it is to eat there — I feel so lucky to know this awesome gem exists. Try the sushi and the rolled tacos and the cheesecake!!!<//Review>

From the food to the staff and the chef, everything was nothing short of exceptional. Im vegan and I appreciated how everything was fresh and NOT processed. Our server (esmee) was very informative about the menu and super attentive. I was there with a friend and we were so curious about the entire menu that we ended up ordering from the Mexican dishes to the sushi. The baked roll was AMAZING! I absolutely recommend this and the street tacos! They have Bootch Craft on Tap (my personal favorite) There is not a bootchery in town so finding hidden gems such as the village that accommodates to food, beverages + neighborhood faces is always a pleasant time. Honestly probably my favorite vegan restaurant this far</Review>

Extremely kind people, beautiful place... And everything is VEGAN. Bless this place. Only had one dish so far; it was ok. Pricey, but willing to try more dishes...</text>

My comments (and star rating) here are specifically COVID-19 related. I stopped in today for a ToGo order. This was the first time since pre-March when COVID-19 changed life as we knew it. There were 5 people working: two servers who were both wearing masks (thank you!), the chef who was wearing a neck/face gaiter (thank you!), the prep-cook who was sort of wearing a mask (covering his mouth only), and the manager/owner lady who was not wearing a mask at all and was walking around and talking as though there was no concern about a pandemic virus. :-(

Food-wise... still as good as I remember.< /review>

<text>Got off the plane one day, typed in Vegan restaurants on Happy Cow and came up with THE BEST cooked/plant based vegan restaurant in San Diego. I've been back now 6x in the last few months and highly suggest giving this place a try!!  The horchata was a great start followed by the cauliflower ceviche and the guacamole (we were starving) Yum! The jackfruit chimichanga has an amazing contrast of both sweet and savory, which was both filling and satisfying. Topped off with a "not to be missed" blueberry (this time) cheesecake. Impressive! The experience there with both owner and staff had me very excited about coming back to town to try more of her menu. Thank God that I did. The next time I came to town I went back to the village determined to give her sushi a try. What an experience!! The owner is a very beautiful soul, bound and determined to boost immune systems through the love and effort she puts into her food. Very wise and educated on health issues and safety, she's gone further than most to educate herself on the current state of affairs and is very knowledgable on what true health and wellness looks like in a time of severe misinformation on what humans need to be doing to avoid any sort of virus or sickness. Super impressed, her staff is very nice, very educated people and its far and away the best plant based sushi I've EVER had!! If you're new to plant based, I highly suggest giving The Village SD a try, I would not have known I was eating Vegan, or meat or fish at all!  It's a great place to show your loved ones you care and educate them on what immune boosting and anti toxemia/dis-ease eating looks like!! Thank you to owner and staff for my experiences there. I'm forever grateful for the love and light as well as the work you all are doing, your food is amazing, the people and the experience unparralled, so happy to have found The Village SD 💚<//text>< pictures>

This place was great! There was water and chips & salsa at our table just as we were sitting down. We had tempura vegetables as an appetizer and ordered the spicy tuna roll, the loko roll, and the soyrizo rolled tacos (easily distracted by Mexican food) for dinner. Everything was delicious, my favorite being the spicy tuna roll. We finished off with dessert, a slice of banana cheesecake and a slice of chocolate cheesecake. Both were great and I really hope that chocolate cheesecake is going to be a permanent item. I can't wait to eat here again!<//Text>

Sonia our waitress was very accommodating, she brought over a cushion for my boney butt to start. Was very patient when I asked her a bunch of questions regarding the menu & even brought me a sample of the Jamaica so I could decide on what to drink. Even better was the special order of sushi I requested & she had the chef make.  My girlfriend had the Chili Relleno & said it was good, she also loved my sushi. For appetizer we had the Vegetable Tempura, which consisted of carrots, zucchini, purple cauliflower & asparagus with 2 dipping sauces. Very light & tasty 😋. Did I mention the awesome chips & salsa they brought over to start?  Will be back...<//Text>< GmapID>

Food was great, staff was friendly, and the decor was nice.  I had the mole enchiladas.

Was definitely on the pricey side, but one could expect that for a vegan restaurant.< /review>

<Text>My wife and I went to The Village last weekend and what a great experience! We tried the Chimicahnga burrito, miso soup, 2 sushi rolls and the calamari. From the start we were greeting by the owner Alondra. She was friendly, helpful, suggested items to try and was very service oriented. The food was awesome. Delicious, had good portions, was all organic and different from any vegan restaurant we’ve tried. She had a gentleman playing music while we ate that made the experience even more delightful. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and all the employees were well trained and helpful. We can’t wait to go back and try more of her menu! Thanks again Alondra! Fred and Alma</Text>< pics>

I went to The Village this weekend and I can’t say enough good things! What a creative concept for a restaurant. I never thought I would go to a Vegan Mexican Japanese restaurant. But, I’m so glad that I did. I was so happy to see that the location of the previous vegan restaurant was being used for another vegan restaurant. The mood and ambiance of the restaurant is so beautiful. The remodel looks amazing.
The food - wow. My compliments to the chef! I fully embraced the Mexican and Japanese fusion and went with the tajin roll and the Mexican ramen. Just wow. It was so so so so good. My husband got the village roll. He is not a vegan (he’s pescatarian) and said that if vegan sushi tastes that good, he wouldn’t mind giving up fish. It was seriously so good!
The staff was so personable and kind. They took the time to talk with us and offer recommendations and give us a history of how they decided on their concept and invited us back again.
I recommend this restaurant to everyone, vegan or not. It is absolutely the best.<//review>

We just finished eating here for the first time and I'm blown away! Everything was fresh, delicious and extremely thoughtfully prepared. We had the Elote, Calamari, Chile Rellano, Enchiladas Verdes, Spicy Tuna Roll, Tropical Roll and the Village Roll. We ate every bite of every plate and only wished we had room to eat more. Personally I am gluten and soy intolerant as well as being vegan and I am so excited to see them labeling for those allergens and most of the menu is gluten and soy free And whole-foods based without sacrificing ANYTHING. The food was seriously incredible as is the atmosphere and service from every friendly face there! As locals, we're so grateful to see the old Anthem building feel totally updated and refreshed and churning out such high-level nourishing dishes. We can't wait to come back over and over again!!!</review>

The manager does not wear a mask.  This is not acceptable considering that the rest of us are making that sacrifice for the safety of OTHERS.   I like this place a lot but this is a dealbreaker for me going forward.  Sorry.<//review>

<review>It was a great pleasure being assisted by Zachary Brewer. He was super helpful, calm, & just respectful. He is a good asset to this DMV and please do pray you get assisted by him.

<Text>Only 1 person working the window processing transactions. A huge line, unable to make appointments. Now closes at 4:30 instead of 5pm but time change isn't indicated on their door of opening and closing times. If you are already in line when they close they will turn you away no matter how long you have been waiting in line. I understand they had to implement some changes due to covid but they did not implement then well< /Text>< Response>

Made us wait in line, telling us we were gonna get checked in, for 2 hours, then when I missed my driving test appointment, told me it was my fault for not checking in. Also told people there was an extended 1.5 hour wait so they could go on lunch together. Don’t recommend. Go to Fresno’s black stone one.< /text>

<text>Misleading hours on website and on the building. They close when they like... regardless of posted hours. Today was 4:30 typical buricatic waist and disregard to the public that they should be helping. The manager Zack has no power to manage only follows some arbitrary orders from Sacramento. This was a waist of a day. We need to clean house with all the waist in government. Time to privetise services such as these to provide good service. Just Sacramento's finest at work over here. Locked the doors in my face believe they took great joy in the power they have over common citizens.< /text>< Pics>

You expect long lines at any DMV, but not 1 employee at the window.  Stood 45 minutes in line before moving up just 1 space. Finally an employee came out asking people in line who they were there. When she got to me and I told her what I was there for (a copy of a release of liability on a car i had sold months ago) she immediately told me she couldn't help me. I explained I was told by a California Toll system that I needed to go to DMV for a copy.  She went inside and came back out and told me they didn't have that information and couldn't help me. I told her I would remain in line and talk to representative inside, she got irritated.  Just then another employer walked out and she told him, "can you deal with this lady". I explained to him the same thing. He went inside and came back with forms I needed. I thanked him for talking the time to listen and left. The one employee very unprofessional. I also believe California DMV, even in a small town shop have more than one person at the counter.<//text>

They don't want to do much since they can use COVID as an excuse. No reason they can't look up an "out of state" vehicle ... It's more like, "we don't want to work that hard".  Be prepared to stand in a line of 10 transactions (9 in front of me) for two hours or more.< /Review>

It is amazing lucky! I had previous an appointment in three ago due covid 19. They texted me back with reschedule (am Deaf get best way to communicate) so...very exciting because took long forever keep in my mind " when dmv open? Over and over. Finally! Customers are good people and they know little sign language. What a relief and I passed behind the wheel exam! Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>I drove 1.5 hrs to get here today an hour early for my appointment because it was recommended by co-workers. As soon as I walked in the guy at the counter seemed to want to disqualify me from my appointment. He would say this form didn't qualify and the guy next to him would say yes it did. He would say something else I had gotten pre-approved by phone didn't qualify and he would again be corrected. Finally, he said that because I was using my birth certificate, I needed my marriage certificate to explain my maiden name change. That would be understandable if I hadn't called, chatted, e-mailed and confirmed over and over that I had everything I needed to get this done today. I'll never go back to that location.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x8096b759f59adcb1:0xbd5666d70eaaa1df</gmapID></record>

8/17 drove from Merced hoping for a shorter line only to discover it was CLOSED! No type of notification on their website to inform the public of their closure. On their website it states they were open. until 5 pm. What a waste of time.<//Review>

This is by far the BEST DMV office ive ever had the "pleasure" of having to do business in. The people are great~nice, fast, & efficient. If there is a wait, I would bet money it wont be long....I am usually in & out usually within 30 minutes, with no appointment! I've waited in line just to get a number at the DMV's in Fresno before. Please be sure to like and share if you appreciate this review. Thank You!🌲</text>

Terrible. It is slow and the worker I had experience was very rude and arrogent in explaining to me what I needed to know. Have in mind I went in with no clue what I was doing or what needed to be done, there was no need for impatience or attitude. It is cramped, few sitting areas and the service is very slow.<//Text>

Don't judge a DMV by its bathroom alone. I can't believe one less than perfect bathroom visit could devastate their 4.5 star service. Let me just say that a DMV visit is never the highlight of my day. Nevertheless the Mariposa DMV offers convenience to the mountain community, the lines aren't terribly long, and you can make an appt. to get in and out quickly. I have been to 3 other DMVs, Fresno, Merced, and one in the Bay Area, none of them were half as quick and quaint.<//review>

< review>
Don't judge a DMV by its bathroom alone. I can't believe one less than perfect bathroom visit could devastate their 4.5 star service. Let me just say that a DMV visit is never the highlight of my day. Nevertheless the Mariposa DMV offers convenience to the mountain community, the lines aren't terribly long, and you can make an appt. to get in and out quickly. I have been to 3 other DMVs, Fresno, Merced, and one in the Bay Area, none of them were half as quick and quaint.<//review>

<review>Went here because I thought that it would be less of a wait than turlock or modesto. This is a tiny Dmv with 2 staff members, who both seem to have trouble with computers. There was no line out the door unlike turlock, modesto or merced. Our number was 5 away from the current person being served. But thanks to the slow service it took us waiting more than an hour. In comparison with other dmvs in the area that have lines out the door, you are in and out in under an hour.
DO NOT GO HERE expecting fast service. Bathrooms are filthy.<//review><Response>None<//Response>< username>

Customer service is great the only downside is that they charge you a $1.50 for using your credit card or whatever you're spending they charge you a differential of your dollar amount..</text>

< Review>
this place is horrible I order a dozen and got home and got the wrong items . And called back and the lady that didn’t speak English was so rude and said she couldn’t do nothing about because that’s the morning girls fault ? So to come tomorrow to the girls in the morning ? What am I suppost to do with meat popusas ? Not eat today because of that ? I spend 30 dollar and have to wait for that to tomorow to get my food , ? And no refund !!? I also asked for the boss  because I met her and she’s nice and the rude clerk said she was in Mexico ? Ok I get that . But she can’t  just redo my 12 popusas I order and payed for . Isnt that common sense . Plus I have my receipt  . She had the time , There was no customers what so ever In the store . What an airhead< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Today I went to buy food at this restaurant, when they gave me my food order I asked a lady if I could Give disposable plates for the food since I am in the process of moving; his answer was that each dish must be charged at 50 cents each plate or box of duropor to carry. They are well deserebrados if they think to be doing this are some mesquinos that horror not even a scrub fork gave me, This food establishment requires training and standards of customer service, I prefer it to 99 cent and buy 40 dishes for 1 dollar and not waste my money there buying dishes.

Horrible experience overall.

Ordering by phone resulted in serious confusion and a mixed up order.

After picking up my food, I discovered the meats had been swapped with no notice and the 'breakfast burrito' was stuffed almost entirely with rice instead of the advertised filling ingredients.</Review>

Excellent, efficient, good quality service. I waited for 5 minutes. 3 burritos and back to my vehicle. The area isn't the safest so night time visits aren't ideal, but t well lit area.< /review>

First & foremost no way should a burrito cost 14$ but i understand to a certain degree considering all thats going on these days but when a 14$ burrito has an over abundance of rice & beans & very little steak then it becomes an issue.This is the 3rd & last time i food truck for each time i feel as if i got screwed,i do not recommend this particular truck on 44th ave but go to the one on Fruitvale & E.10th</review>

<text>I'm always in that area and and more so on that block often but every time I go two tacos Guadalajara I can say that I've never had a bad taco or burrito maybe the service was a little in need of work but other than that the food is impeccable and I gave them four stars.

<review>Their truck is brand new and the area is super well lit. There was a lot of people there at midnight and I realized why very shortly. I got a super burrito which was $15 and 2.5 lbs. I thought it would be a regular super burrito but this this was big enough to feed two people or more.<//review>< pics>

Ever since I found this place it's been my go to spot for tacos. They put a lot of meat so three is more than enough. Also, their carnitas are great!</Text>

< Review>
I stopped here around midnight with my husband and got tacos I'm not a meat eater but I said forget it I'll try their tacos only because I wanted fries  but wasn't willing to pay $8 for some regular plain fries and not even a large order the guy made that number up off the top of his head. So the tacos were $2 each and we both ordered two, mine ground beef his steak with cheese and sour cream. The man charged us $10 for 4 tacos and they were disgusting! The shells were soft and uncooked and the guy was rude and  had an attitude I definitely would not be going back there . It's such a disappointment because it always has a decent stream of customers<//Review>

The taco truck and the area around are great with new benches to seat, new lamps that give lots of light, parking lot.

But the main thing suppose to be the food, I ask for 2 beef tongue tacos, 2 more of cabeza and a soda, the first ones were good, but the cabeza were horrible, I don't think they were made of cabeza, because I had been eating those tacos all my life.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>This location is one of my favorite for late night grub spot. There are a few that are along International Blvd. I will go through some of them quickly and what type of scene the spot contains n their specialty.

1. Tacos Mi Rancho
Location: International Blvd n 1st Ave
Scene: Popular with the transient Americans as it doesn't have any of the raunchy scene you would normally encounter with the others. Specialty: Carnitas n Veggie Burrito

2. Taqueria Sinaloa
Locational: International Blvd n 22nd Ave
Scene: Popular w/both the locals n new transient that dwells within the vicinity. Has decent parking, tables n a second truck within feet of each other. Glimpse of working women can be scene in plain sight during the day but more prevalent at night.
Specialty: Shrimp Tacos n overall burrito

3. Mi Grullense Taco Truck
Location: International Blvd n 30th Ave
Scene: Popular with the local Mexicans, Paisa n other Latin group. Good size parking space available compare to the previous scene. Similar raunchy scene of working women can be seen from this location as well. Best to keep to yourself and stay within sight of the Taco truck for your own safety.
Specialty: They are good for their overall menu but on the drier end of the spectrum where it's okay with locals but not for my pallette.

4. Tacos El Gordo
Location: International Blvd n 42nd Ave
Scene: Popular w/lots of locals n heavy traffic scene. Expect long wait especially during the late night when things heat up. Parking can be hectic so plan ahead n bring some drinks while your at it. Party in the back parking lot away from the prying eyes of the police and enjoy your food.
Specialty: Overall good food but the portions tends to be smaller than the other stalls. They make up for it by offering moist n delicious tacos. A lot more pricier than I would have like. The owners have been inflating the price for the last 3-4 years. The reason is for this is to fund their other new location while retaining their profit quotas.

5. El Taco Zamorano
Location: International Blvd n High St. Their other location is a few blocks down on 48th Ave.
Scene: Pretty much a dead scene for the most part.
Specialty: There isn't anything that really stands out on this scene. This is the definition of meh quality where it just is a waste of your time. Parking is limited and this also deters a bit of traffic from coming through.

6. Tacos Guadalajara
Location: International Blvd n 44th Ave
Scene: Hidden gem with the locals w/enough parking. The outside place has been remodeled w/seating n good lighting. The views however is dead as the location is on the farther end of the International Blvd where not too many venture to. It's also only fees away from a halfway house so beggers are a common scene here. Other than the usual asking for hand out...they usually do not bother the patrons.
Specialty: This place is considered the second best options to going to El Gordo and I really do wish that they will catch on in time in offering home grilled serrano peppers versus can jalapeños from the store. It really makes a big difference...the cost is little but the difference is huge. Hopefully they are reading this.

Tacos Guadalajara is my favorite scene as it tends to be quite and I can enjoy my meal out of of trunks while just minding my own business. If I'm with my friends n the night is still young then no doubt I will be over at El Gordo w/a bottle of Hennessey and 20 tacos for the friends n I.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I didn't like them Really they are too expensive for a flute $ 3 no and the truth is that I did not eat tacos al Pasto and any other taco is the same I thought that because they were from Guadalajara They went to these a little better than elsewhere but no and the It is really very expensive compared to the other side that if they are rich it was my first time but I had a bad experience I wanted to eat a flute and for each flute $ 3 no that is unfair therefore no I do not recommend it I do not give it stars

(Original)
No me gustaron Real mente son demasiado caros por una flauta $3 no y la verdad que pues no yo comi tacos al Pasto y es igual cualquier otro taco pensé que porque eran de Guadalajara Iban a estas un poco mejor que que otro lado pero no y la verdad se me hace muy caros a comparación de otro lado que si están ricos  fue mi primera vez pero    tuve mala  experiencia quería comerme un flautas y por cada flauta $3 no eso es injusto por lo tanto no no la recomiendo no le doy estrellas<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The truth took me a disappointment the tacos that I ordered. The omelette was too greasy. It was more the oil flavor. That does not ask to enjoy the taste of meat. And the omelette one day. I'll give you another chance for the moment disappointment ☹️

(Original)
La verdad me lleve una desepcion  los tacos que ordene. La tortilla estaba demasiada grasosa.  Fue más el sabor  aceite. Que no pide disfrutar  el sabor de la carne. Y la tortilla algún día. Le daré otra oportunidad por el momento decepción ☹️</text>

This place is a very solid, no frills Indian restaurant. We went with three other people after attending a movie at the Indian Film Festival down the street a few weeks ago (~2pm). The place wasn't crowded, as they were an hour away from closing for a few hours before their dinner shift. Service was very friendly and relatively quick. They have an extensive vegetarian section of the menu, as well as meat and fish, so there's really something for everyone! You can choose to get your dishes mild, medium or spicy. They're known for their spicy, but we got everything medium, out of concern spicy may be too much and not fun to eat. Medium wasn't bad at all, but I could see how spicy may be too much! (Side note, my stomach didn't feel great afterward, which I attribute to the spice more than the food).</Review>

<Review>The food is always delicious, the service is always great, and the atmosphere is romantic. On our recent visit, I asked the waiters to help make the night extra special as I planned to propose to my girlfriend after our meal. They ensured we had the perfect romantic table and helped me pull off the surprise without a loop. And she said yes! This restaurant will always be a special place for us.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bf211d3eff55:0x38d8c5872ff10080<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>This is the best Indian restaurant in Los Angeles. And no, I haven't tried all the other ones. Don't have to, don't want to. I don't have a car and it's quite a hassle to get there without one, but that still won't keep me away from this place. Now you have an idea how good it is. Highly recommended.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>The cost of meals and other items is reasonable. You won't have to think about finding a parking space either. They have a big parking lot where more customers can park. For me, this has been a completely unique and unforgettable experience. This is a book that everybody can read.< /Review>< user>

<review>Saving this restaurant's contact numbers for reservations was ideal for me. They strive to provide us the best service that exceeds our expectations. No hidden charges compared to others!

We live in LA, so we usually do take-out. However, we've eaten at the restaurant and had the same wonderful experience. As others have pointed out, this restaurant is in a strip mall, so it isn't really anything to write home about. Nevertheless, the food is outstanding! I LOVE the chicken Bhuna, Vindaloo, and Butter dishes. If you like it spicy, they will deliver! One great part of dinning in is BYOB policy with NO extra charge. If you forget, there is a convenience store in the same strip. So, if you are doing LA on a budget but still want to enjoy an evening meal, give Crown of India the chance to impress you with their food!</text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>I stopped in for won ton soup, a recommendation from a friend,  and really enjoyed it! The broth was tasty, nice variety of fresh vegetables, and the pork won tons were delicious! A hot tea pot was brought to the table immediately, which i appreciated because i don't know any other place that does that! It was perfect for the cold day. The service was great and Linda was very attentive and smiley. It was nice to find a spot with good won ton soup because there aren't many places! The menu offers a lot and i have to try the Singapore Noodles next because i hear they are to die for! There's a parking lot for customers and the bus stops right out front. The place is clean (bathroom too!) and i will be back!< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<response>None</response><text>The only other place in the whole of Los Angeles, where Indian food tastes authentic Indian. The veg.jalfrezi with its the aroma of bell peppers is so intoxicating. The base gravy curry for any dish tastes different here, unlike many other places. The second best dish I order here is the veg.kofta, again it is spectacular. I have eaten other dishes here, but these two are my favorite ever, limited to vegetarian diet. I also get a side of sliced onions just to entice and please the taste buds even more. Other Indian restaurants need to lure customers by offering groupon or yelp deals. If you like this review please vote.</text>< gmapID>

I was under the impression we would have an exercise room. I brought my workout clothes. We were not informed that we would not have access to it until I tried to go. I couldn’t reach the spa either. I feel like the resort wasn’t worth $1 per night.< /Review>

What a wonderful experience, an absolute must! I had a reservation for 4. When you arrive, you check in with your ID, then are greeted by the hostesses and taken to your table. The indoor vibe was dope as we walked through the restaurant to the outdoor seating area (make sure to bring a jacket if you are coming in the evening as I didn't see any space heaters). Also, don't plan to stay at your table all day, even though you're going to never want to leave- reservation windows are only for 90 minutes. There are no TVs.

We were then greeted by our flower hostess who took our order from the perfectly curated Cannabis menu followed by our food server who had recommendations about the food. For only being open for a few days, I was impressed with the knowledge of the staff. One suggestion would be to have something to roll up your weed on the table. I was excited to see that the matches, crutch pack, papers, and hemp papers were all complimentary.

We ordered the nachos, mac and cheese bites, corn dogs, burger, grilled cheese, pork sandwich and chocolate sunday. Absolute must haves include the ice cream sunday and the vegan nachos. I'm not a vegan and don't usually like vegan food but these were exceptional. Now onto the ice cream sunday...it was an experience. From the caramelized banana to the toasted marshmallow to the amazing brownie. I would come back and just order the sunday with an order of fries.<//Text>

We ordered the Americana Steak kit for four. It was very simple to order over the phone and we were given a time for pick up. Once we arrived at the restaurant we gave them our name and within a few minutes we had our meal kit ready. The package and presentation was done very well and even came with a personalized note and instructions how to prepare. All the steak cuts were of high quality and the sides as well. Our family enjoyed kit and we look forward to coming back to Bourbon for a sit down dinner in the near future.< /Text>

House of joy has been our families local Chinese place for a years now. The food is always solid and the portions are generous. The Peking chicken is truly the highlight for me. The lunch special is a deal you can't pass up. Highly recommended!</Text>

<user>103177396679859427564< /user><rate>5< /rate><text>We read some folks' review & was curious. We wanted some good Indian food. Hard to find in the North East. We are from South India. We got to Crown of India at 2:00pm. We were please with how hospitable the wait staff was. The lunch specials were quite good. Taste, quality, quantity exceeded our expectation. I ordered chicken korma. The others in my party ordered lamb vindaloo, chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala curry, tandoori chicken, garlic naan. The sides were either spinach or chick peas. Everyone in our party was very satisfied. Every order was very pleasing. Just blown away by the portions served. We definitely will return to this restaurant when we come back to this area.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2bf211d3eff55:0x38d8c5872ff10080</gmapID><date>1614836175550<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place is awesome! I went with my family and we can't wait to go back. We had a variety of dishes but one of our favorites was the steamed egg, so simple but delicious! Also we were big fans of the okra on glass noodles! And the panda baos for dessert were super fun and yummy!</Review>< UserId.>

<text>We came for lunch on a Saturday with our 4.5 year old son.  My husband was hungry after a long morning walking around, and asked about portion sizes.  She got great advice as to what to order, and we were very happy.  It was perfect, not too busy... good food and my son ate everything on his plate (which is hard to do).</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf211d3eff55:0x38d8c5872ff10080< /Gmap_id><user_id>111565474992006351576</user_id>< Response>

<text>This restaurant is AMAZING! The prices are reasonable, the portions satisfying, and the food is delicious and comforting. If you are looking for a good Indian restaurant in Hollywood, the Crown of India is the perfect hole-in-the-wall location. Whether you're ordering a vegetarian dish or a meat dish, their food is packed with flavor and obviously made with love. During my darkest COVID days when I would sit in my apartment tired of cooking or forgetting to eat, Crown of India was always a go-to choice to save the day. Support this restaurant!</text>< Resp>

Always was a regular at the other two Sri Lankan restaurants, but was getting weary of the "they have to come here" attitude. On a chance I happened on this hidden gem. The food is phenomenal only surpassed by the the smile filled hospitality, wanting switch something that comes with one dish to another? Where the others made is seem like brain surgery, was responded to With a "of course, why not?" The cuttle fish (squid) deviled was stupid good and don't get me started on the cutlets. No order is too large if given a fair heads up (owners words). Go eat here, you won't be disappointed!</Text>

If you live in a part of the country where Mexican food is made with fresh vegetables and freshly prepared sauces, you'll be disappointed. The food was tasty but not authentic. Lots of Amercan cheese and canned or bottled sauces. Service was friendly, but the server made a mistake on the order and it took her 10 minutes to bring another burrito, by which time everything else was cold. Not the best place in town.</Text>

<Review>This is our favorite Indian Restaurant in LA and we have been coming for about 4 or 5 years.  We mostly order vegetarian.  The quality of the food is very good and that has always been consistent.  My favorites dishes are the Shahi Paneer and coconut curry.  I also love Kulcha.<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

I went to Akbars with a few friends, I was delighted with the very modern decor, it obviously has had some money thrown at it! The atmosphere was buzzing as it was a Saturday night, and it was the perfect start for a night out on the town. As we had not booked we did have to wait just over half an hour for a table, but that did not bother our group as we could sit at the bar with some well mixed drinks. For me though the food was indeed fresh, It was very filling, there was a good selection of deserts but were much to full on the main course to even be tempted! And the Naans are HUGE! they arrive on a vertical device that holds the bread ... I would only order 1 for about 3 people. Get there early if you can at the weekends, I would choose somewhere a little quieter if you are wanting an intimate dining environment!< /Text>

Indian buffet houses are hard to come by in this area... Star is clean, hospitable, reasonably priced, and the general food quality outstanding... The sag paaner is exceptionable! You would not be out of line to come in for that dish.< /Text>

Akbars is a fabulous, contemporary Indian restaurant in the heart of the city. It is always busy and you can't book but they have a good bar and time always goes quicker than you think. Food is exceptionally reasonable, massive naans, brilliant service and a really lovely atmosphere.< /text>

<Text>Totally fascinated with the food of this place, I think one of the things I like the most is the presentation of their food, I am a fan of Mexican food and I think I got my new favorite place. I totally recommend the House Special Bowl. In addition, they have all the security measures in this world with Covid.< /Text>< pics>

Friday dinner, not too busy, nice greeting, seating and immediate drinks (BYOB no corkage fee, liquor store next door also sells Kingfisher). Gratis papadum perfectly made. Excellent Indian salad with onion, cucumber, carrots and tomato. Spiciness will be to order. I loved the chicken boonah medium hot. Rice was just the right amount of moisture. Garlic naan, yum! Nothing was overdone. If you're still hungry the rice pudding is recommended. Service throughout was attentive and helpful. Ambiance was modestly decorated and dimly lit.< /Review>

<Review>I was really excited for this place based on all of the great reviews but it definitely fell short. We got the chicken masala & paneer curry - the sauce for the masala was really great, however, the chicken was funky. It either tasted a day or two old & was dry or was chewy - either way, really gross. The paneer’s sauce was not good & it squeaked on my teeth when I ate it. Overall, this place was a huge bummer.< /Review>< pictures>

Finger lickin' spicy hot chicken made to order fresh and super juicy too!  Came to this new addition in the La Crescenta-Montrose area to try their chicken sandwich.  I love spicy anything and decided to order it in SpICY! Oh boy was it spicy but in a really good way.  Made me sweat out through my pores but I definitely enjoyed biting down into some juicy chicken breast with cole slaw and melted cheese.  It was more than a mouthful and just one sandwich made me full!  Fries are soft yet crispy and their signature sauce is to die for!<//review>

<Review>It’s one of the best North Indian restaurant in LA. The food is really fresh and tasty; service is quick; staff is very friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable. If you are in LA and craving for North Indian food, you must get a dinner at Crown of India 😊😊😊<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I am a traditional kind of gal so I'm not too keen on fusion type of dishes but I have to say that the Indian fusion dishes here are pretty dang good. I feel like the plates are a bit on the smaller side for what you're paying for but Indian food is fairly heavy so that might be a good thing. Other than that, dinner was pretty tasty and I left satisfied and happy.</review><GmapID>0x80c2bf211d3eff55:0x38d8c5872ff10080<//GmapID>< resp>

We were staying close by and my husband was craving some peruvian food. We decided to go to this place since it had awesome reviews.
We arrived and we were not able to get a able right away. The place was crowded. We waited for about 25 min to get a table. Very important-Make a reservation. Once we got our table, the attention was immediate.
Since this restaurant is participating in Miami Spice, I decided to order the menu since it has a lot of variety and ir included an alcoholic drink.
My husband ordered from the menu as well as my son.
We ordered SO MUCH! The food was delicious and most important the attention was great!
I totally recommend this place to try awesome peruvian food and a superb customer service.< /Text>

The Lamb curry thali was excellent. I do like to have a main course and some vegetable side dishes but cannot eat another full curry that so many Indian restaurants force you to buy.
They don't serve beer but the liquor store next door is able to provide. And the restaurant does not charge corkage.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Crown of India is the best Indian food I’ve had in Los Angeles. Being that my dad’s side of the family is from England (where curry houses are as common as taquerias in LA), my standards for Indian food is pretty high and this place never disappoints. Not only is the food good, but the staff is pleasant and friendly as well. If you’re a fan of the cuisine and you’re in the area Crown is a must try.< /review>< pictures>

<text>A quiet Wednesday night at Madrid. I wish they had live music tonight. Perhaps I have to visit again. Very friendly people with great attentive service and typical tapas menu. I love a good tortilla and theirs was very good. I ordered a "pincho" which in Spain is usually a small slice but tonight they gave me two meaty sized pieces. I also had the "gambas al ajilo". - garlic shrimp and they were typical (meaning done right) and delicious. I am a fan of good fresh bread with my Spanish food and theirs was good although it was toasted. To top it all off I then enjoyed a "paella de marisco" - seafood rice dish.  It was delicious. The rice was well done and the seafood consisted of octopus, scallops, shrimp, muscles and other things. I would rate it about 7 out of 10 for the paella.< /text>< pics>

this is one of my favorite restaurants in miami guaranteed. everytime i've eaten here, the food does not disappoint. i've tried everything on the menu, & even tried the 4/20 & family style serving menu & wow, solid. my favorite thing to get here is always the dessert, of course. from the pancakes to the dirt cup, everything is delicious.
make sure to make a reservation before you go because this place is always poppin. i love how they have daily specials now! so exciting.</Text>< Pictures>

This restaurant has been a family favorite for many years now! Incredibly flavorful and delicious Indian food. Everything we've tried  has been excellent and they are generous with their portions! The service is prompt and the consistency unmatched. Our favorites include: cauliflower, spinach, okra, eggplant and lamb korma. But you can't go wrong! The shopping center it's located in is in a bit up upheaval - but don't let that deter you. It'll be worth it!< /text>

<Review>Crown of India truly has one of the best tasting Indian food in Los Angeles.
I’ve been going there quite regularly for around 10 years and the food has consistently remained to be the best each time. My favorite is chicken korma but the other dishes are equally delicious.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

DO NOT EVER GO HERE - THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!

The worst Indian food I ever had in my 29 years of life! “Manager” told us she is “NOT” the manager and later talking with other servant found that she is the manager! She specifically told that - “It’s customer fault”.

Finding great Indian food in this town isn't easy, so I'm deeply thankful I found Crown. This is easily the best Indian food for the best price I've had in LA in the 5 years I've lived here. I visit probably once a week.<//Review>

This is my absolute favorite place to get Indian Style Food. The Korma and Coconut Curries are delicious as well as the Mango Lassi and Veggie Samosas. This is my go to spot if I'm looking for amazing food! 10/10 would constantly go for lunch and dinner if time ever allowed me.< /text>

This is my favorite Indian place in the world; and I travel quite a bit! I’m vegan, and love that most of the vegetarian options can be made dairy-free—without compromising the taste. Some of the other Indian restaurants Ive been to can’t accomodate special dietary needs because their food is premade; but Crown of India’s food is made fresh when you order. They are the friendliest people, with the best food for the best price. The atmosphere is also relaxing. I’ve been there for dates, catching up with friends, and even business meetings. You don’t have to yell over a loud dining room or anything. It’s just very chill. I guarantee you that you’ll fall in love with this place!</review>

I would have given " ZERO" If there is an option. We've been there today ,and we recieved the worst service ever,manager told us that she is the server there and server said he can't do anything when we told him that their mango lassi has a pungent smell and, we ordered 4 tea and no one was able to take more than 1 sip it was so bad, when we complained about it manager left the reception and ghosted us. And started commenting that we r at fault ,customers are like this only,plz never ever go to this place</review>

My favorite place for lunch! The food here is amazing, service is quick, and the prices are reasonable. Can’t go wrong with the chicken tikka masala, but feel free to branch out! It’s all delicious.<//Review>

I just moved to Los Angeles two months ago and have been missing my NYC Indian spots. This place holds up! Love the chicken tikka masala. Also great, quiet spot with a friendly, attentive staff. One of my fav restaurants in LA for sure.</Review>

Love the chicken pakora with the mint chutney sauce, Korma chicken, mugalatani soup, and the chana masala. My usual. Tried other locations, and for me, this one is the best. I dont live close by anymore, but, it does not stop me from driving through traffic. Totally worth it!</review>< user_name>

Best Indian food in Los Angeles!  I admit that I have a healthy addiction to Indian food.  I've been to nearly every Indian restaurant in Los Angeles and many in other countries as well.

The lunch specials are a great deal, and are served every day except Sunday from 11am to 3pm.  Dinner portions are large, and it's great to share some entrees with others, small party or table of ten!

My favorires:

Chicken Tikka Masala - tender, marinated chicken smothered in a mouth watering, somewhat smokey flavored Masala sauce.  I like it spicy!

Saag - creamed spinach, always freshly prepared and never watery, spiced to order.

Veggie Korma - Coconut flavored curry, really amazing!

Chana Masala - Garbanzo beans simmered in Masala sauce, spiced with some fire if you like!

I could go on for pages, but this would be a very long review.  About as authentic as it gets without traveling to India, I'd say. Nice ambience, great service and feels more like visiting a family for dinner than going to a restaurant.  Alright, all this talk has me hungry, so I must head over there again soon!< /review>

<time>1565104821219< /time><rating>5< /rating><Text>The best Indian that I have found in LA!

Great flavor and spice and always pefectly cooked.

Favorite Entrees:
Chicken Vindaloo (curry, potato, tomato, lemon)
Regular Curry or the Jalfrazzi (curry w/ bell pepper, onion, garlic)
Mahkni (Buttery Sauce) try with fish or lamb.

When I order for a group I prefer to get the flavorful Pulao Rice (basmati rice, green peas & onion) and extra garlic Naan w/ basil.

Great place to order vegetarian! Their tofu passes the test but I really enjoyed the Began Bharta (roasted eggplant).

Bookmark this place!

p.s. not the Paneer but the cheese naan (cheddar Jack filled) is delicious almost like a quesadilla and great add-on for picky kids!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1565123058111, 'text': 'Hey Joseph.

Best Indian food we've had in the city and a meal we have about once a week. And staff is wonderful! We've been going regularly for years. Get the Thali. We get chicken masala thali. and saag paneer thali and Coconut Curry ala cart with cheese naan on the side. Enjoy!<//Review>

I had this Yogurt Shake with Mango Pulp and it was really really good actually! The new owners are very friendly and nice. They seem very genuine and I will be stopping by every time I am in the area. No doubt that this is a pretty good hole in the wall place!!!<//review>

Dr. David Jin Lee is a remarkable physician. He listens whole heartedly and is very thorough. I trust him and feel safe under the direction of his care. It took me years to find someone like him and he exceeds every principle I look for in a Doctor. Feeling blessed and grateful.</review>

<text>I actually read reviews of Dr Gen prior to selecting him.  I'm happy to report that all the rave reviews of this doctor are very true.  It was one of the best experiences I have had with a General Practitioner.  I'm very excited that we have found a doctor who treats you as if you were a friend, as he is explaining things to you.  He goes into great detail if you want him to, to make sure you understand things. He made it very clear the two of you are in this together, that he will get the results and then decide together the best course of action. This is how you would want your doctor to take care of you. I'm afraid to recommend him to much a let the secret get out, but that would be selfish.  If you are looking for a new doctor in the Glendale area this is the one.<//text>< pics>

I really appreciate the staff and the nurses who assist the doctors.  They’re kind and patient. Dr. Alexanian has been attentive to my medical needs. I appreciate her. She is straight forward and direct. I like that she explains why she is prescribing something and the outcomes for doing it.</text>

I would absolutely recommend Dr Lee - he is very respectful, attentive and patient, really listens to you and takes his time to find the best course of treatment for your ailment, with you as a partner. As a patient, you feel you're part of your own path to health.</Text>

Staff and Dr. Gen are A+.  Easy check in and out.  Dr. Gen is easy to have a conversation with which is what I loved the most.  I was given options and the pros and cons of each one.  His plan of care was made clear to me which was key to put my mind at ease.<//Review>

Had to come in for a semi-emergency visit and saw Dr. Alexanian. She was prompt, courteous, explained her reasoning for prescribing a lower dosage antibiotic. We were in and out i a half an hour! Just wish that there at least 10 more handicap parking spots at the building!! My wife has to semi-park to get out my wheelchair, unload me into the chair and wheel me into the building before going to look for a parking spot!</text>

<review>The maternity ward at Glendale Adventist is fantastic. The rooms are huge and the medical team top notch. You could not find more caring nurses, all passionate about their jobs, like the lactation specialist who was also super helpful. I did not have an easy delivery due to complications and had to have a c-section under general anesthesia but my rock star OB, Dr. Shirley Chan along with the team of specialists and nurses made every thing go smoothly. If you chose Glendale Adventist as a Maternity Hospital you will be in good hands.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Hi have been seeing Dr. Gen for the past 5 years. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. Uses common sense and not only theory when diagnosing me and my family.
The staff is always polite, prompt and professional. I travel from Pomona to see Dr Gen. He is amazing< /Review>

<Time>1552386848100< /Time><Rating>2<//Rating><review>I would like to start off by saying first impressions are not always the best, that's why I'm pretty lenient with my reviews. I changed primary Doctors because I have heard great things from Dr. Takeda's office. My first time there in 2 years I had a physical. It went great. I liked the attention the Doctor gave me and was very thorough.  I have Diabetes type 2 and I check my glucose with my glucose meter twice a day. The main reason why I was going to the doctor was because I needed a refill for my glucose test strips and I had a bout 4 days worth left. At the doctors visit I brought my meter with me and showed the doctor my meter, he pulled out his laptop and started typing away. I was assuming he was writing down my glucose meter info. He told me he was going to send a new prescription with refills for my test strips. This is where everything went wrong. It took 4 attempts to get my test strips right. At one point the doctors office ordered test strips for a machine I didn't even have. It took longer than what I had left of my test strips. I had to start using my husbands glucose meter to keep track. I went to the Doctors office on March 1st. I got my correct test strips yesterday March 11th. This was not good customer service, or in this case patient service.< /review>< pictures>

But I didnt have to worry. Dr. Gen and Dr. Sarkisian are amazing doctors. They LISTEN. They EXPLAIN. They formulate a plan of action amd explain it to u, not just tell u. They keep with u til they pinpoint underlying issues. They are smart and kind. I highly recommend this medical group.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c10aa5405d89:0x77f5219a554a80ea</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>So far so good. Although I’ve seen Dr. Gen only once, he seems to be offering support for my taking charge of my health with a holistic approach while providing me with needed information and consult.  I have received an excellent referral  to physical therapy. Test results have provided more relevant information than I’ve had in the past . They are quick to post and accessible. I’ve had multiple overlaying issues, digestive (SIBO), musculoskeletal, pain, urinary tract, and cancer recovery.  So all of this is no small matter and means a lot.<//text><user_id>116155160725912638514< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

This was my first time with Dr. Susan Dasta and at this office. It was easy to find with free parking. I was met with a smiling and warm receptionist and aside from completing my new patient paperwork, there was no wait time. The nurses where welcoming and Dr. Dasta immediately made me comfortable. She is personable and approachable. This was the most comfortable I felt at a doctors office in many years. So very glad to have found Dr. Dasta and Adventist Health Physicians Network.<//review>

We had the great privilege of meeting with Dr. Sarkis Kiramijyan, cardiologist.  He is, without a doubt, the most thorough, caring, and competent physician that we have ever met.  If you need to see a Cardiologist, this is your guy.  I guarantee you, that you will be impressed.< /text>

<text>Great all-around experience, front office staff was friendly and helpful, the medical assistant was very thorough and professional and. Dr. Alexanian was amazing, very easy to talk to and very concise, she was the first Dr. who ever took the time to do orthostatic blood pressures on me which is saying a lot given the fact that I have a history of low blood pressure and arrhythmias. I I found my new doctor, thank you to Dr. Alexanian and her entire staff for a wonderful experience<//text>< Pictures>

The hospital was great and have great facility
The staff's, nurses are nice & accomodating and my Primary Care Physician Dr Karen Yeo was very good in dealing with her patient she was very attentive & accomadating and gave more time to evaluate the patient concerns.

I would definitely recommend the Adventist Health Physician's Network to my relatives as well to my friend.

Highly recommended Dr Karen Yeo😊🖒!!</text>

<Text>I’m very surprised by all the 5 star reviews.  I do agree that the office staff and some, not all, nurses are warm, friendly, and courteous, as well as there being a short wait time, however I do not believe the doctors (at least the one I saw) are knowledgeable, courteous, caring, and helpful.  My experience was quite the opposite.

Firstly, I was assigned to Dr. Arlet Sarkissian as my primary physician, a very green doctor, by my new HMO.  When I explained everything that I needed during my visit, she became agitated and had a mini meltdown saying I needed to come back for more visits (basically saying she can’t help me during that visit).  Not helpful at all, and clearly not someone who I can respect or trust with my health (emotional immaturity speaks volumes).

Additionally, being someone with a chronic condition having seen many doctors over my lifetime, I knew by the questions she was asking me that she clearly had no idea what she was doing.  An example of this was when I showed her my insulin pens so she knew which insulin to prescribe me, she asked me why all the pens were set to zero.  I explained that the pens were set to zero because I was currently not dosing (you only set the pens to the amount of insulin you choose to inject at the time of injection - which a doctor should know).

Long story short, I have no confidence in the capabilities of the doctors at this facility due to my experience with Dr. Arlet Sarkissian.  Although it may not be fair to throw all the doctors at this facility in the same category, I have no desire to take chances with any other doctor there.  If someone there thought hiring Dr. Sarkissian was a good idea, then all the more reason.

My advice is to stay away from this place entirely.</Text>< Date>

<Review>I don't hookah and came here late at night for dessert. The staff was super friendly and the semi outdoor atmosphere was great. When it got cold the manager moved a heater closer to us. This was an unexpected find.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Great place to chill and relax, very cozy that you feel like home you find a good hookah friendly staff.
If you are looking for a restaurant or a good food this is not the place and that's why this place called CAFE however the food they have it's very reasonable and a good combination with hookah.
I normally come here weekdays with my girlfriend so it's a nice place for casual girls night out.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

<gmap_id>0x80c293568f31b18f:0x5257095e899f2187<//gmap_id><review>The place looks cool enough, but they close pretty early. They were closing at 12:30 on Saturday, not 2am as posted on Google. Just wanted to warn about the closing time, but don't know the appropriate stars to give, because we didn't get in at 12:30.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< user_id>

<Review>You're always gonna see the owner old man there. Most of the time its very packed but you'll find a table. Hookah is mediocre. The only decent food is fries. Capuccino isnt bad  neither the tea. There are heaters available as well.<//Review>< Rating>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Always. Always, a chill place to relax with friends, read a book, or watch some sports/movies and listen to some tunes while enjoying the best hookah in town. Try the wings, and now even more glorious, the tacos. 10 out of 10, will smoke again!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>The wait times for the service for hookah is terrible. There is one worker for hookah and he's very humble and apologizes when the wait times are long when we asked him. The owner needs to hire 2 more hookah attendants because our party of 6 ppl waited 45 min from the moment we ordered hookah. When it's a little bit buzy expect to wait around an hour for the 1 hookah worker to get your order. It's really unacceptable.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
In communities founded by asthmatics, in which half of all households still include an asthma sufferer, what we really needed was a hookah bar?!?  Completely insensitive to local residents.  Zero landscaping, zero attempt at lot upkeep with weeds growing through cracks in the asphalt.  Rude customers and proprietor.< /review>

Great staff, top quality parts. Had all but one I needed, but they recommended another shop that had it in stock. A+ will come again. Prices are more than AutoZone/O'Reilly but it is 100% worth it because the quality is much better so they last longer and it evens out .</text>

Absolutely outstanding service. The battery in our CR-V died today and they sold me a Napa Gold battery, brought it out to me in the parking lot and even lent me the tool to install it.  The attitude was, as usual, great.  These are the reasons that NAPA has my business.</review>

Napa is the place for the more experienced person working on their vehicle. It's old school, 9 times out of 10 they will have what you need. Not just the general stock like other "part stores".< /Text>

They know what they're doing not like amateurs at Auto Zone or Kakakragen.
Workers at NAPA have experience with automobiles not bicycles.<//Review>

<review>Today when I got off of the metrotrain at downtown Riverside, my car would not start.  Luckily I had jumper cables and a nice man close by to help me out.  I found Napa Auto Part store right around the corner and they were awesome to me!  I am a single 55 yr old female and it has been a while since I have had to change my battery.  Although they could not install it for me, they assisted me and I want to say thank you!  I recommend this store!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It was nice to receive text message updates as to how the status was coming along with my car during the process. The staff was friendly and even stayed open later so I was able to pickup my car just a few minutes after they were closed.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I was rear-ended by a car on the road, and the other party is fully responsible. The insurance company recommended this store to me. After replacing the exhaust system, the store told me that the repair was completed. I drove to Los Angeles and found my exhaust system around on the way. The plastic plate lining the rear anti-collision steel beam was scorched and melted by the newly installed exhaust system. When I returned to this store 3 days later, I was told that I had adjusted the height of the exhaust system privately, which led to the current situation. I went After using Ford after-sales service, they told me that the shop installed on my car was not original parts, which caused the problem of damage to the exterior of the car. I was deeply angry. This shop refused to admit it and I will not repeat it. Give your car to this shop for repair, never<//Text>< pics>

Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! I have been in the hospitality business for over 20 years and I can tell you that Caliber Collision exceeded my expectations completely. Not only were they extremely kind and gracious during the whole process, but my vehicle looks and feels better that before the collision. Keep up the fantastic work.</review>

The business is very clean and professional, the staff are friendly and communicative, and the organization uses technology effectively to keep me informed. Drop off and Pick up were a breeze.

I even made a mistake with billing, and they corrected it within the hour.

Highly recommended.</review>

<Text>Thank you Nick and team at Caliber Collision. Brought my car in for repairs and Nick was super cheerful and communicative throughout the whole process. He and the team made my car look even better than it did pre-collision.

I was referred here by Nissan of Fremont to get my front bumper fixed. Lobby area was super clean & welcoming. I was greeted by Nick Barrios with a pleasant smile. He quickly accessed the damage and within no time the front bumper was fixed and my car looked as good as before. To my surprise I wasn't charged even a penny. I was in and out within 15 mins. Very professional guy, highly recommend.</text>

<name>Justice Bolden<//name><time>1603129090394<//time><Rating>5</Rating><review>Caliber Collision provided excellent customer service from start to finish. The process of dropping my vehicle off for repairs was seamless. Once the repair process began, Terrie texted me early and often to keep me up to date on the process of the service.

I received a projected completion date, and the work ended up being completed on time. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was able to leave my rental car with Caliber Collision staff, saving me the hassle of driving to Enterprise. My car looked beautiful when I picked it up, to be honest not just the repairs on the outside, but the inside of my vehicle was in better condition than I turned it in. All of my personal items were neatly wrapped in plastic bags in the back of my trunk.

The car also had been detailed from front to back both inside and outside. I highly recommend Caliber Collision.  Be sure to talk to Justin, the General Manager, the next time you are looking for quality collision repair.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
My vehicle was vandalized for a second time and since I had already had such excellent service at Caliber Collision I already knew where to go. Terrie, who was my estimator who covered my last claim, had my car covered right away. She had may estimate for me within 20 minutes and ready to start my repairs. She was nothing short of friendly and professional, I knew I was in good hands.

The technician who worked on my vehicle cleaned all the glass. They even removed my door panel and cleaned up all the glass that was inside the door! My car is cleaner than when I left it and I'm so happy with my repairs. Thank you Caliber Collision. If I ever need to get any repairs done, I will definately come back.<//review>

<Review>Great service from start to finish. They worked my insurance company to make sure it was done right. My car was done within two weeks. And I recieved texting to keep me up to date on their progress. Paint is flawless and all the body lines match  up. You honestly can't tell it was ever worked on. Hopefully I never have to use a body shop again, but if I do this will be my only one. A+.< /Review>< Rate>

All honesty...ok service... I came to get my car estimated, and they took pictures of the damage, I haven't heard a single callback from them at all about the estimate. I tried calling back , but never received a message or email. If you aren't patient save your time and go somewhere else that would provide better service.
Update: Might give a chance, but there'</text>

<name>Ed Roldan< /name><date>1488985977098</date><rate>1</rate><review>Called my insurance company. This shop was one of the ones they had on their list of shops they deal with.  When I went in they had all my paper work ready and I wasn't sure why because I haven't decided I wanted to use their services. Their front desk person seemed a bit unfriendly and distant. She scheduled just my initial estimate inspection 3 1/2 weeks away. I thought it was odd as there was only one other customer just sitting in the lobby. Every other shop I've been in to rushed to do the estimate even for walk in customers. I was not impressed by these people's child like behavior. I've been living in this area for more than 40+ years it's always the same type of people being malicious towards certain races of people. I hope they don't retaliate against me or my insurance company for writing this review. They do have my personal information.</review>< pictures>

Got my car estimated here . The person handling my estimate was friendly . The girls at the front can do a better job tho . Dont work in customer service if you dont like interacting with ppl.
They have free snacks in the lobby and its fairly clean . The location in San Leandro is much better as far as customer service.< /Review>

Nice and clean! Which is super important especially now. Micheal was very nice and didn't mind fixing my sandwich just the way I like it. I like subway so it's nice to go to eat at one with friendly employees that don't mind making my sandwiches with all my specific sandwich requests!  5 stars.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Went Friday night around 7:30. There was no one in the restaurant except one employee pretending to clean the floor, but really just talking on the phone. Waited at the counter for several minutes before this same employee decided to get off the phone and step behind the counter.  During our order, he informed us there was no more white rolls.

The only good thing about this visit was that we discovered the sushi place next door.  But will not be returning to this Subway again.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>The woman was very nice but had a hard time following me. She heard grron pepper somehow (jalapiños,red onion,and pickles) and when I corrected that she put the peppers back! It was a chicken teriyaki and the peppers touched the hot ingredients.  Putting them back is a serious no-no. Cross contamination anyone ? Also the next sandwich was a 6 inch steak and cheese and I catch her making a foot long. I just paid for the other half as I was hungry. Poor thing just wasn't processing English very quick. Give her time maybe?</review><Date>1513063504907< /Date><user_name>Gabe Henning< /user_name>< gmap_id>

<Text>Every time I drive by this store, I remember the time the lady cut the sandwich and the bread crunched (because it was stale). She paused; then, looked at me and told me "that (crunch) is because the bread is fresh." WTH ... seriously? They lost my business ever since. Still makes me laugh, but not in a good way. lol.< /Text><Response>{'time': 1468199726414, 'text': "Hi Jay,\n\nI'm the franchise owner of this Subway location inside the Kohl's shopping center,  and I want to begin with sincerely apologizing for the poor product that you received in our restaurant.

A+ on the service I received today making up for the fact there was not enough iced coffee to fill my order. They in turn, replaced with a better drink of my choice. ALSO - the way they are handling COVID and distancing is phenomenal in comparison to other locations I have been too and especially other food establishments.< /review>

It is an unique experience here. I just realize it is Starbucks reserve. Good experience to sit around. Enjoy the coffee. I place a mobile order. And the order was ready quickly.  I like the black reserve cup. It looks really cool. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

<text>Homeless folks are here a lot with their dogs, chargers and food from outside. They don't seem to mind or know what to do. Place can get quite smelly at times inside. Restroom can get really messy. They recently removed a lot of tables inside. It's a shame what has become of this place opened in the 80's. I hope management figures out a smart plan.</text><gmapID>0x808fcc0ed9fc9177:0x4ee969267e4ee3f2<//gmapID>< date>

The 5 stars goes directly to the staff alone. The young ladies were very courteous and efficient. The best thing was that one of the employees walked an elderly woman to her car.  You just don't see that nowadays. To the lovely, polite, courteous ladies at this location, keep being wonderful.</text>

It's not bad. Albeit friendly, you don't get that cozy one-on-one feeling did you get at small town shops. Typical chain store feel.<//review>

This store closed 10:30 PM instead of 11 PM posted on Google map.  Either Google or Starbucks should be blamed for posting incorrect information.  Starbucks employee simply said "we're closed" with unwelcome glance.  Not warm at all.<//Text>

<review>It tends to get crowded and there isn’t a lot of room inside. Get in and get your coffee to go. There’s maybe four tables outside. Starbucks staff is friendly and never had a problem with my drinks. Parking might be a problem. A Korean supermarket is next door and it was packed last time I went.
FYI: Starbucks on Calaveras Boulevard is super nice. Just incase  if you have time to hangout and relax with your friends. Black Bear is next door if you get super hungry.🍽< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Instead of politely asking kids to move so he can help other guests he said in a rude way, no excuse me or nothing. Very unprofessional. At least treat family people nicely.

Very nice and convinient. Always pack of people, probably because of the residence area and popularity of the nearby. If you want to skip the line, starbucks app with mobile order is the way to go.< /text>

I witnessed very unpleasant situation there. There were three men with a dog sitting on a table near the Starbucks entrance. A guy with his kid was about to open the Starbucks door when the dog suddenly barked and attacked the kid, scaring him a lot. Those three men instead of being sorry and apologizing, started to laugh on the kid and make fun of them. The guy complained to the Starbucks staff, but they seemed to be friend with those three men and were covering them by all means.<//review>

Service was okay, place is very small and some strange people in this store, maybe because of their open policy.  Not the nicest or safest.< /Text>

The service was okay..I was greeted a few times by the same barista who was preparing a drink which was nice and kind of odd..( I wasn't sure whether he was going to help me with my order or not)..I was finally helped by another nice worker.. although after taking my order, he didn't take my name ..or thank me or tell me the transactin qas finished which I am not used to.  This place is busy in the morning for a weekday which is fair but it is also packed ..maybe that's why the customer service was a bit off. My drink was made in a timely manner, considering there were a lot of people waiting. The biggest distraction I noticed was how dirty it was for a Starbucks establishment. I didn't want to start snapping away with my phone, but the windows were streaked. I saw water streaks on the clear glass on the counter. The floor had garbage, the mirrors had finger tracings/drawings on them and overall, it was just the dirtiest starbucks I have ever been to. The one I normally go to is Evergreen which has less workers.. just at busy at times but I always see them cleaning and making sure everything was in order.</Review>
