I took the class and gained some good knowledge and experience, passed all the test and had my license by next week. Went out and got a bike and now I'm on the road. It's been great, I'd definitely like to take some more advanced classes.<//Text>

I wish every weekend could be as fun as my 2 days learning to ride a motorcyle.  This is the best money I have spent in a long long time.  All of the instructors are so helpful and awesome.</text>

This school was awesome, the instructors ...Vince and Chris were the greatest. They made it fun to learn to ride. They made you feel comfortable , explained everything and was always open to questions. They take safety very serious so just follow the directions and you will be ok! Believe in yourself and believe in them and you will be riding in no time! Troy Taylor</review>

They know their stuff. I've been riding 3 years, but there were a few newbies in my class (3 females, 1 male). They all passed! No favoritism, they all earned it and that was due to 2days of studying and training. A couple of them never controlled a motorcycle at all. They rode the courses from instructions of instructors.< /text>

SoCal Motorcycle Training Basic CMSP Course is well worth the money. I'm 56 years old and hadn't rode a motorcycle since I was 22 years old. The classroom and skills course work were excellent. There were several people in my class that was held on Dec 28-29, 2019 that had never ridden a motorcycle. Vince does a great job walking everyone through the basics. By the end of the 2 days everyone was saying what a great course this was and how we all felt comfortable and confident on a bike.

I passed my CA DMV written test 5 days after taking the course and brought a 2020 Harley Street Glide the next day. I have been practicing my riding on the weekends and I still hear Vince, Bubba and Chris in my head when I drive. This course has already kept me from making mistakes as a new rider. I am following up on the advise to continue practicing the material I learned during the course.

I will take the intermediate course in a few months.<//Review>

Totally worth every penny and every minute! Justin & Alison were awesome, patient instructors with clear passion for riding and safety. I do not doubt that the sound foundation of safe riding and good judgement this class established in my riding habits will one day save me - life and limb.</review>

You will drive or ride away with better way of riding on the streets. I for one learned new skills and also a different way of thinking other then what was learned away from the class. A must if your a rider. Vance and Adrian was the best.<//Text>

I went to this class with ZERO experience on a motorcycle what so ever. Within the the two days that I chose to take the course; I was able to learn how to ride in just two days of training, and pass the the performance test. The staff are VERY friendly and knowledgeable. It makes a comfortable learning environment for you and your fellow classmates. With a low price and flexible training days, I couldn't  of chose a better place to learn. I will definitely recommend this place to those looking to get their M1 or M2.</Review>

It's a good OTR (On-The Road) course. You can use it to get your license without taking tests. Instructors really know their stuff. They're funny,  friendly, and will do their best to get you acquainted with motorcycles(and on your way to a license).

I highly recommend to supplement the course with a good lvl 2 Off-Road course after 3-6 months of riding with your license. Honestly, the sooner the better. And don't let anyone fool you into thinking classes aren't worth it. They are definitely worth up to lvl 2. After the lvl 2 course you do wanna give it time to let everything sink in and for you to gain hours using proper riding technique.</Text>

I have 10 plus year of riding a motorcycle and this was the 1st instruction i have ever had. I recommend every rider take this course. I learned better stopping and cornering. I have much more confidence in my riding ability. These instructor are real every day riders, NO B.S. here</review>

<text>Great school, good classroom insight, awesome individualized attention, and happy experienced teachers. I hadn't been on my bike in a few years so I decided to take a refresher course and pull the trigger on my motorcycle endorsement. I had orginally picked this school because they were close by, in hind sight I'm glad I went with this school. The instructors that I had Matt Pistol and Justin (I'm sorry I can't remember your last name it's not as catchy as Matt's.) were top notch. They both have many years of riding under their belts. You can tell that they take pride in what they do and have your safety and best intrest in mind. When I took the class  we were just about at capacity, but the instructors were still able to take the time to give you an individualized lesson. The skills and knowledge that I obtained through this program have stuck with me and have saved my life a few times. After taking their advice and constantly working on those skills they become muscle memory. They make the learning process fun, entertaining, and best of all, memorable. I would advise anyone thinking about riding a bike on the streets to take a safety course. If you're going to take a safety course I highly recommend this one, you will not be disappointed (unless you show up late and Matt puts your fate to your fellow class mates).< /text><UserId.>111372825009046650957<//UserId.>< Rating>

<text>Prior to the class, my only motorcycle experience was a few hours on a 125 in the dirt, then bought a 650 (the deal on the bike was too hard to pass up) but felt overwhelmed on it even just going down the street...after the class, it's just feels like the perfect bike for me.  The class made all of the difference in the world for me (at least for street riding)<//text>< Rate>

Their curses are totally worth it. I took their curse without any riding experience, and I’m so grateful I did. Because for sure the knowledge that I got there has already saved me from getting hurt and damaging my new motorcycle. And of course, having extra money saving due to insurance discount is a plus too, he he. I recommend this to any anyone that hasn’t taken this course. Keep up with the good work SoCal Motorcycle Training School!!!< /Review>

From beginer to advanced riders, everyone can take something from this course, starting from the key fundamentals all the way to advanced training their is always room for improvement and bettering techniques. Vince and adrian were both very informative and professional instructors with fantastic knowledge and understanding of whats needed in each individual taking the course. You can tell both vince and adrian love what they do and they take their work and others safety to the absolute highest standards. If you just got a bike do yourself and your loved ones a favor and take these courses. The sooner you start instilling proper riding practices the sooner youll be confidently enjoying the open road! A++ 5 star rating , CMSP for the win!!!< /text>

I had 0 experience on a motorbike.  The first day in training, I was riding on my own!  I Highly recommend Justin, he is an absolute amazing instructor!  As long as he is there, I will continue to refer others to go to SCMT.   Justin, Allison, and Bubba genuinely cares for every student and makes the whole experience comfortable and fun!  I will be back for the intermediate and advanced courses.</Review>

Justin and Zig were my instructors. THEY ARE AMAZING. I'm a first time rider and not only did I learn a lot but I had a lot of fun doing it. Zig and justin explained our task in detail and cheered me on when I executed the task properly, giving me soooooo much confidence in myself. I would recommend this course to any beginning rider.<//text>

<Text>It was good food. Pricing was a hair on the high side for a burger joint, but the fact that they have different burgers all together, made it a difference.

The only real complaint I'd have about this specific location, is that the seating arrangement is a bit cramped for guests. Perhaps removing one set of tables would space everything out enough to allow for better guest spacing accomodation.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Order just a burger simple just one change. Oh why did I do that? Won't comeback again. There was a rude girl in charge and somebody who was obviously new which is fine but this girl had zero customer service, dropped my change, no customer service skills whatsoever and my burger took literally over 30 minutes to be made and was trying to be patient but at the 25 minute mark I had to inquire about my order and she gave me this look like I was annoying her. Very frustrating! Like I said, won't comeback.<//Review>< Pictures>

This is the only burgerim I have been to but it will be the last. They are a bit pricey and it takes a minute to get your food but all that would be worth it if the food was good. I got six different burgers for 6 different friends and no one was impressed.</review>

The service is good and the burger was delicious. I don't try to do burger comparisons because each place has its "thing." What stood out for me on this meal were the fun potato chip/fries, the quality of meat and the bun. Not a big fan of the drink dispenser, it leaks a flavored syrup taste into my Diet Coke.</text>

The beef, and chicken burgers are delicious so are the fries and especially the onion rings. As far as the chicken wings I'm sad to say I'm a little disappointed, they are just average. Wish they had a little more kick to them, not spicey at all. But the rest of the food is great. A little pricey but I know quality and atmosphere is trendy and good.</Review>

We had an Immensely satisfying dinner here, it was my first time at a sliders joint. The staff was polite and helpful, but it was the sliders and fries that stole my heart. I'm definitely coming back, this is the pinnacle of quality fast food. My favorite is the wagyu burger and the aged beef, worth the try!< /Review>

I’ve been here 3 times and just can’t keep giving a new place the benefit of doubt.
First visit - Soda machine broken
Second visit - New employee and bad service
Third visit - New menu and the employee says the Uncut Garden burger is grayed out on his screen and they don’t offer it. He calls out the cook to confirm and says he does not if or know when it will be available.

So I don’t know if I will ever go again.
Heading to In-N-Out now.</text>

Newly opened Burgerim Halal in Norco, CA.  It's located within the States Bros shopping center called Norco Center.  Adjoining a Starbucks store.  This is a neat plaza coz it's in the one and only, infamous Horsetown USA!  Cowboys & horses parking provided!  Come visit for the fun and the food if you like ...<//text>

<review>We have utilized Chrysalis for our Auto/Home and other insurance needs for several years. Always attentive, responsive and willing to shop our policy around to find a lower premium. As someone who works in the insurance industry, I am very particular about who I work with and they have been a tremendous resource and partner for us personally and for our clients.<//review>< Name>

Eric and his team have provided quality coverage at a competitive price. They are proactive and offer value by requoting my coverage each year to make sure that I have the correct coverage at the best price.</Text>

<date>1603923040061< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Eric and his team have been a great resource for my business. I have multiple lines of coverage with him. I really appreciate that they are brokers, so Eric presents me with options for different carriers. Obviously, the options have different prices, but the lowest price isn't always the right choice when it comes to insurance coverage. Not only does Eric give me options, but he discusses the benefits of the different plans. I feel like I am making a well-informed decision about insurance coverage when I sign a new policy with CIA. And, to top it off, Eric is always quick to respond when I have a question. I have referred Eric and the CIA team to family and colleagues, and they all thank me for it! Highly recommended.<//Review>< Pics>

A good agent to service your insurance needs! Insurance might be a pain to some, but think about it....when you need it, it is there and IF you ever have a claim you are getting a huge coverage amount for a little investment now! Its for your future needs!< /Text>

Whenever I need there Services, I almost immediately get a response,( almost) meaning that as soon as they receive my request, they respond. I know this because i would email them late in the evening, then thinking we'll get a response sometime the next day.  Too my pleasant surprise, i get a response the same evening, assuring me my request is taken care of. The whole team is pleasant to deal with.

So happy with  this insurance company.  they insure  my home and autos,  they  are quick to return calls, if I have a question and are great also to respond thru email. They represent many  companies which  gives  them  lots of choice to service their customers, and to give the best rate possible at renewal  time. I also love that changes or questions  can be addressed online...The office staff is knowledgeable  and efficient.</Text>

We have gone from a reasonable sized client to a small one at this time.   However, we have never seen a lack of service or performance in all our time of doing business with CIA.  They are truly a  professionally run organization and able to handle both large and small clients with superb results.</Review>

After many years of having Chrysalis handle all of my insurance needs, I can confidently say Chrysalis Insurance is always on the ball.  Call with a question or a problem and they are on it immediately.  They know insurance and are happy to share the experience with their clients with the goal of consistently obtaining the best coverage for the best price.</text>

<review>Eric, the President of Chrysalis Insurance Agency, and his staff are the best in the insurance industry!  I've worked 27 years in the Plaintiff's Personal Injury field and I always think I can find a better and cheaper insurance policy every time my auto and home policies come up for  renewal.  Well, I CAN'T beat CIA!  They are amazing at their research and will find the best policy for you and your family.  They have excellent customer service and understand the stress that insurance companies place on our finances.  Eric always responds fast to my concerns and he makes the process enjoyable, even when he has to tell me the "not so good" news.  I will continue to refer to Eric and CIA for all my insurance needs and those of my friends and family.</review>< Pictures>

By far the easiest, hard working, great pricing, and professional insurance company I’ve worked with thus far. The team has been walking me through the various steps for different coverages as a business owner. I definitely would recommend them to other business owners.

JON HAS HANDLED ALL MY INSURANCE NEEDS FOR THE LAST DECADE
WE HAVE BEEN THRU IT ALL..
HE IS PROFESSIONAL, PRUDENT, AND REALISTIC REGARDING  NECESSARY COVERAGE AND EXPERT LEVEL EXPOSURE ANALYSIS SEPARATE HIM FROM THE REST.
.I THINK MY AUTO, RESIDENTIAL, RENTAL, RV, UMBRELLA, LIABILITY, COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND WIDE SCOPE GENERAL LIABILITY HAVE LED TO SOME CRAZY COVERAGE STORIES.

JON AND HIS COMPANIES HAVE YOUR BACK..<//Review>

Buying insurance is something nobody likes to do but it makes a sleep better at night knowing we have it.  I've been using Chrysalis insurance agency for the last 8 years.  I've found since they represent so many insurance companies they always provide me the least expensive options available.  I sleep better at night knowing my home, car, and business are Insured by AAA rated insurance companies at the lowest rates<//Review>

What a horrible agent!.
We purchased a house and switched insurance agents to make it easier with financing. It was nothing personal against Eric but he took it personal.
Our Escrow accidentally sent Eric a check for home owners insurance.
Eric sent us an Email at 8am on Christmas Eve and stated "Since you suddenly elected to cancel all policies with this agency, severing all ties" we had 4 hours to contact him or he was setting up our insurance.
When did we state we were severing all ties?
He has our phone number and decided not to call us relying on email as the only form of communication.. On Christmas Eve!
He gave us 4 hours to respond so a phone call was appropriate don't you think!

Now we have to send a written letter to cancel the insurance.
Very vindictive.</Text>

My law partner and I trust our busy law practice's business insurance needs to Eric Evans and his team at Chrysalis. Eric makes sure we have no holes or gaps in coverage, and that we are also not overinsured. Eric and his team process quotes with lighting speed, renewals, too, and we've never had anyone beat their quotes for outstanding coverage. As our business has grown and there have been reasons to add and increase policies and coverages, Eric has always been super responsive. Everything you want in an insurance agency!<//text>

I have known and used Jon Summers for all my insurance needs.... Um.... I will not say how far that goes back. Lets just say that I knew him when he was cutting his teeth while his father was my agent!

When Jon split away to go independent I was lost during his non-comp clause period.

You have a jem in Jon Summers I hope you appreciate his effecency and astute ability to be able to interact with all personality types even in some difficult policy writing circomstances.

Thank you for the privlage to be able to continue to work with him.

Mis-classified my environmental consulting business for 3 years for workers comp. It doubled my premiums than what I was originally paying. After those 3 years I had another agent take a look at my workers comp and placed me back into engineering as I should have been.</text>

its a mom & pop hardware save the costs are a chunk high, but they bring about suitable outdated elements & system that the home Depots & Lowe's  might not an excellent place for a handyman . The body of workers is ok excellent sufficient but not overly pleasant.<//text>

<text>I'm not prejudice at all. But, my #1 pet peeve when dealing with the public, whether it be on the phone or in public,  is having to try to communicate with someone whose English is frustratingly limited. The should be a law requiring at least 1 person, who speaks "Fluent" English, to be on the clock during Business hours. If u can't speak English fluently, u should not be able to work in an English speaking Country.</text>< pics>

The only place that sells some of the greatest car care products available... Ebony Wax... If you've never experienced this incredible liquid wax,,, you are most definitely missing out on a very remarkable car care products line that I myself "lucked upon" some years ago when I happened to me the maker..<//review>

Today when arriving at 2102 Van Ness 4800 South Ave there was a tenant at the place where I came to paint this morning that was passed out on the floor apparently he was having a grand mal seizure I called nine-one-one and he was able to respond so he's fine and I'm good hopefully the rest of the day will be bright and sunny with no more interruptions of Health and any other situation of this sort< /Text>

I am so in love with Goodwill and thrifting! I think Northern CA has THEE BEST Goodwills anywhere in the USA! Pics are from Goodwill Boutique, Downtown Sacramento on L street, Goodwill Stockton Blvd, Goodwill Auburn Blvd and Goodwill Beech/Greenback- this week!

<user_id>104842780192878787622<//user_id><review>This Goodwill seems to be more organized and clean than most. It's a pretty big store with the majority being clothes.
There are plenty of friendly staff that help you out. They keep the place stocked well items picked up off the floor.
As with any Goodwill items vary as they are donated.
There is handicapped parking and entrance. There is a lower level that has a huge ramp leading down. Sadly the bathrooms are gender neutral.< /review><username>Len Joe</username><GmapID>0x809adb3347230753:0xccf5dbaf60fa4357< /GmapID><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsHmk7lpsZoECSIajFoSk9d9NOFv76byPwl9d2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM29PU3Pk1gYO9Nqp16ARBfSYUpxGDOpMLFhfIS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBaatFvilFdmrpQ-VA5TPMCeK-QutO7IFwS7Ad=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAWg2C5HoaKyuv4Jzs68SXO-_eTNftQeHNRVGy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0YOikdJllJ63pOQmimW-JcXC-HCyPVvC8ZQZO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWYLamfEFHOreR7EtHBvVwcrqZ6pZX5iPwqEqw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxPbJNsFPqftwsHNG38WyAkxGCaIafYmXaYZRj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8qWJBjXPdItLRDRMzunnn8-xDZGAkCK_Fm9j8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgsrUMkYK9uy7W6oDzahqgEje57OVzn81qdD2R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnfleifuASwIrfSuh3jJDxVu6rP_Bnk68UebuR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8aHPJJ2IMD2o88FcaXLG3VchRrJtcvnVRGxfV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV3ywFq6ZWKJ_yH-LLPvN6p0TwdV9ePp44W9aR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGaJoxUFSe0K_a3TY8vmjxPWnDCuAuKLBZGtiu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1P8Ypenf8LV8cRfc_AlzeiHZrAVLZDaiqvV6v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLiYJ_0tbG5u5wQus4hpR81ZfUe8K6Qq70UnLZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBfGYcCUipBAeHYr5cR9M982l7kVfJls_L5Cgp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCT7bbwrB1YrmMW_Gj6nzIF_bF4sEU_b6m2jTp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKivesNmHGZ15tAVcrEsf3v_5h3VJE14MCWo-x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgvupQ9YeYf6psWpb-ED_g8KHlOxtXSnej4MnC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl-S_NJv3DEHvO8oWXFKiB1TgfKpdc4oZxlxGu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><rate>5< /rate>< date>

They close down different sections of the store at 6:30pm including the whole lower half of the store (kids clothes, mens clothes, electronics, kitchenware, knick knacks, kids toys) so forget about looking there after 6:30pm only woman clothes are open. (SEXISTS?) They also close the jewelry case and dressing rooms at 6:15pm. This store literally does not want your money. 🤷‍♀️ Poor business practices and customer service. Hope it gets replaced by a better thrift store or they change their dumb policies.< /Review>

<user>101080371322149367978<//user><Review>This is the old Thrift Town which will be deeply missed. As two of the shoppers of the former store, we are very thankful to see the same friendly faces working in the Goodwill whom had worked for our loved Thrift Town.
This Goodwill store is well arranged but the prices seem to have gone up steeply.
Higher pricing in this area may hurt Goodwill, if for no other reason than the people of the area just can not afford the increase.
We are not able to come to this location as often as we did prior to loosing family members who had lived in the area since 1944.
Now we come down to the area for dental services and to take care other business matters.
In the past and even since loosing the last family member who lived in the area, we would drive down just to see what was new at our favorite thrift shop, Thrift Town.
However, sadly with the amount the prices have increased, along with the cost of gas, we will most likely not come to shop at Goodwill on Stockton Blvd unless we have another reason to be in the area.
Sadly while Goodwill gives good opportunities to many people, Thrift Town will be greatly missed.< /Review><date>1564785127021<//date><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809adb3347230753:0xccf5dbaf60fa4357< /gmapID>< rate>

Perhaps I'm biased as this was the first sit down dining experience I've had since the winter lockdown, but this place is great! Reviewing the dinner variant of Fiore where they have ample outdoor seating and a relatively small menu of italian options.

Food is solid, portions are just right, wine list is great, outdoor heaters, friendly staff.</Text>

Hidden gem on Guerrero. Authentic Italian restaurant with friendliest staff and reasonably price.

The owner is from Italy and is very personable. Everything on the menu tastes so rich, fresh and homemade.

This is my usual orders for two people:
Mozzarela In Carrozza
Tagliata Di Manzo
Pappardelle Al Salmone
Tris Di Funghi
Tiramisu< /review>

<Text>LOVE the ambiance and atmosphere (looks to have been recently remodeled but still retains its family run restaurant charm), and the food is delicious and reasonably priced for the area. I had the zucchini cream soup and Straus yogurt with fruit and granola. Boyfriend had the tuna melt sandwich which he said brought him back to his summer family vacations. Service was wonderful, you can tell the owners are friendly with the locals who frequent the restaurant. Will be returning!< /Text><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

We live—literally—less than 200 feet from Fiore. It's a neighborhood gem. By day, it's a cafe with great coffee, scrumptious pastries, and a nice selection of sandwiches and salads. At night, it turns into a full-service restaurant where pasta is the star. My favorite dish, hands-down, is the Linguine alle Vongole—tender clams and tomatoes in a spicy white wine sauce. I always say I'm going to order something different but end up going back this dish time and time again. (Although I did once order the Penne alle Melanzane, and it was excellent.) My partner's favorite is the Papardelle al Salmone—handmade pappardelle with smoked salmon, prawns and zucchini in a light cream sauce. It's smoky, decadent, and delicious. Speaking of decadent, the Mozzarella in Carrozza (basically Italian grilled cheese) is over the top and worth the calories. On the lighter side, the Melanzane Grigliate—grilled eggplant with cherry tomatoes and balsamic glaze—is delicious. For dessert, don't miss the tiramisu. I'm *extremely* picky about tiramisu; Fiore's is one of the best I've tasted.<//review>

<Text>(Review on breakfast) Not bad, but not great. I've walked by this spot for about 5 years now and always wanted to pop in - and was so excited to finally try it. It felt a bit over priced for a basic breakfast. That being said - it's a great spot for a good, clean, straight forward brunch/breakfast. If i paid a few dollars less, I probably would have felt closer to 4 star satisfaction. I did enjoy the overall ambiance and very friendly staff!</Text><gmapID>0x808f7e400aee9a81:0xb2088e97727c3905</gmapID><date>1546732887313</date>< Pictures>

<text>Their coffee is life-changing. Last time I had a coffee that was THAT good during my trip to Italy. Their Eggs breakfast is great — eggs, arugula, avocado, bacon and two pieces of toasted french roll — all you need to start a great day with a healthy balance of healthy fats and carbs. I will be back to try their pastrami sandwich and pasta carbonara.< /text><Response>None</Response><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Pretty solid Benedict, but the coffee is decidedly European. Stick to americanos or espressos if you’re used to medium-roast pour-over stuff. Cute place to read and start your morning.</Review>

What an awesome spot, the food is exceptional. Even though some reviews say the staff isn't attentive enough, I have visited this family owned business several times and have always been greeted warmly.

< review>
Food was okay, but service is bad. On a birthday most places do something nice for the birthday person, but this place adds a surprise extra charge for a birthday cake that we brought that were only conveniently told about right before serving the cake (that amounted to $30). They said they are in the business of making money, so clearly their service is provided only to extract a maximum amount of cash. Our group had already spent a lot of money on their overpriced average food (over $40 per person) and they still wanted to penny pinch us for extra plates and forks. Of course when we asked about it they kept explaining that it is a policy to for outside food (great way to make things better). That is fair enough, but this is a birthday and it was a cake for the birthday and we have given them plenty of business.

Also, food took forever to get served (like at least an hour), and it looked like they forgot one person's food or just took extra long. Portions are tiny, which makes the food relatively expensive. Food taste is okay.

This is my first review ever and there are few things that upset me enough to go write one. I made this same post at Yelp, where it turns out if you search by lowest ratings first (because yelp hides most of the bad reviews with their default Yelp Sort) you'll actually see my experience was similar to others.< /review>

< Review>
Underwhelming. After reading other Yelp reviews seemed like this was going to be a simple but good place for a weekend brunch.

I was happy that this was a cozy little spot and easy to book the day of. The coffee was normal and the food was just meh. We got the croissant sandwich and eggs Benedict. The sandwich was pretty average. And the eggs Benedict was also average AND had half an egg shell in the poached egg!! Why I'm giving it 3 stars is because it's not bad, not like there was anything wrong with it and the service was good.

I guess if you're in the area and can't find a place to go since weekend brunch reservations at good places are so hard to find, you can come here. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.</Review>

<Text>I don't know much, but when it's 8 pm on a Saturday night and the place is empty,  leave quick and quiet.  Buratta and tomatoes, at least give us a tomatoes and $3 for bread? Come on.

I love this place - really lovely couple who own and run the place. Surprisingly large, so it’s a good place to go on your own for a quick bite/coffee but also for larger groups for brunch and so on!</review>

< review>
As a coffee place I think Fiore is decent, but I stopped trying to go here for food. I get coffee here often on my way to work. Their drip is good and they have customer loyalty punch cards. I've eaten here three times - once for brunch and twice for dinner - and didn't find it very good. The eggs in my brunch dish were over cooked, and all of the meals were generally lacking in flavor, though they sounded creative enough. The service is friendly but slow. The space is pretty, but that's not enough to convince me to eat there. I'd suggest their coffee or a glass of wine, which you can drink in the front like you're at a wine bar.< /review>

Vegetarian Review: Just ordered a simple salad and pasta pomodoro. The salad was okay but was served with amazing homemade focaccia. The pasta was also fantastic. Great service and lovely owners.< /Text>

This is a good place for a very simple Italian dinner.  The menu is not extensive.  We ordered the Vongole Al Vino Bianco antipasti thinking that it was a pasta dish.  The waiter kindly took the dish and added in some linguine. Friendly service.  I've also been here for a cappuccino in the afternoon.  It's a fairly quiet corner, a street away from the hub of Valencia, so good for those days you want to sit down and quietly chat with a friend.</text>

<review>"Insalata mista" is just grocery store mixed greens drenched in olive oil and topped with a couple pear slices. My salmon was dry and chewy, side vegetables oiled beyond reason. Our bottle of wine and tiramisu were great, and the service was fine. I'd go back for a drink but that's about it.</review><pics>None< /pics><Date>1502554729338</Date>< user_id>

In a time with overpriced gentrified food. It's nice to know that there still is a place you can get good food at decent price. Oh and the service is amazing!</Review>

I can't say enough about this place. Eduardo, the owner was very gracious and accommodating. I gave a dinner party for 17 people for my wife and daughter's birthday. Eduardo helped us plan a special menu (a variation of the house menu) just for our party, which was exquisite! The red wine risotto with radicchio and smoked provola cheese was creamy and flavorful; the fettuccine al ragu was Eduardo's mother's recipe, with beef and pork stewed for 5 hours! Absolutely melted in your mouth, and the tomato sauce was rich and full of flavor! From the skewers of prawns, the pork loin, to the pan seared skirt steak, each dish was expertly prepared and sumptuous. Everyone raved over the food, and the service was outstanding. Fiore's is small, and so Eduardo lined up tables to make a long row, fitted in a section of the restaurant that made us feel like we were in the dining room of an Italian villa. Beautiful decor and lighting. My wife and daughter loved it! I highly recommend Fiore Caffe. You will not be disappointed.<//Text>

Our opening hours are Tuesday through Saturday 5 to 10pm.\nAlso I am the person who is there most of the time and I am 6’ tall, none of the people who works there is a short guy.\nPlease be sure that the restaurant you reviewed is on 24th @ Guerrero.\nI’m sorry this happened to you a year ago. The only short guy I can think of is the old partner that no longer is part of the business.'}<//resp>

It's taco bell I'm not a huge fan, although they haven't gotten my order wrong yet so kudos to you guys great job. The food is decent the people are nice and the location is easy to spot as it's right there on the corner of main street. No issues here I can't review the inside as I haven't been inside in months even before covid I didn't usually eat inside, but the last time I went in it was clean and modern and the workers were out and about cleaning spots and handing out food. The bathrooms could of used a bit of a clean but that's usually customers not employees. So nothing to really complain about the food usually looks like what you order and they're fast enough with the orders, if you're going during lunch rush just be prepared to wait an extra ten minutes because it will be busy usually every fast food place on main street is around 11-1.< /text>

<Review>Food was pretty good. I ordered a bean burrito, beef burrito and soft taco. I liked the bean burrito the best, had the best flavor. I would not order the beef burrito again. It was too spicy for me and I did not like the cheese mixture it had in it.</Review>< pictures>

I was impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and the steps they have taken to keep everyone safe from contamination. It's one of the few places I'm willing to go for take out because it's clear they are following guidelines and still making delicious food. Thanks guys for a great meal.<//Text>

Was just traveling to make a quick road trip, hadn't eaten all day. The dining room was closed and had to download app just to wait that much longer in the drive through. I walked to the sandwich shop across the parking lot.<//Text>

I've been waiting for a full hour and still don't have my food. When I pulled up I was the 5th car in line. This is ridiculous.  I will sadly never eat here again its not worth all the wasted time.< /review>

Great drive thru service. The food on the other hand was before par. Drive the twenty miles home to eat only to be greeted by door that was entirely too salty. Could have cured fish with it.<//text>

<Text>I love this Taco Bell, but I have to give it an accurate review- not 5 stars, and here's why: weather using the mobile app to order (which isn't bad), or driving up to the drive through, they are SLOW. I put my mobile order in 20 minutes before I arrived and ended up waiting another 12 minutes before my order came out the window to me. The food is great, but the service is slow, however very friendly. I think they are doing the best they can to serve their customers, but something just isn't right when it comes to "fast food" service.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Got my food and it wasn't my order parked went inside to sort it out and the manager on duty felt the need to throw the food across the store making a mess and scream at the staff on hand for making a mistake. I know working fast food can get stressful but that was not an appropriate response.< /review>< Pics>

TL;DR: Overall, everyone was nice so 5 stars for customer service. Order accuracy and quality of the food was well below satisfaction. Hate that fast food is always so hit or miss. 🤷‍♀️

Everyone was nice but I didn't get any of the "extras" I paid for. No xtra lettuce on my burrito supreme, in fact there was hardly any. They forgot my cheesey bean burrito, annnd I got a crunchy reg. (very sad reg. at that) taco instead of a supreme crunchy like I was supposed to get with my combo 3 order.</Review>

When you walk  in and only 1 person is ahead  of you and nobody in drive through it shouldnt take more than  10 min from the time of order to the time of delivery not 30 min plus!<//text><Date>1566436444564</Date>< resp>

<Review>The food is very good.  My wife and daughter were willing to wait 2 hours for me to get home with it.  The clerk asked if I qualified for the senior discount  , which thrilled my Scottish heart.  I was pleased with the price.  The food tastes great and the staff was thoughtful.< /Review>< Date>

Stopped here on the way from WA to NV.

Service was quick and friendly. Food was tasty. Got the potato soft taco for the first time and really enjoyed it.

What I didn't like were the prices. For instance, the dollar menu stuff was bumped up to $1.49. I get it; the location is somewhat remote and is a hub for people traveling. But it feels like I'm being gouged.</Text>

Charging $6.49 for the nationally advertised $5.00 chalupa box. Not much difference, but don't like paying more than others. Soft drink was flavorless. Had to ask for a bag. This is not like other Taco Bell  restaurants.<//text>

This has got to be the slowest Taco Bell I've ever been to, all I can say is that if there's more than two cars in the drive thru you might rethink about going there especially if you're in a hurry.</Review>

Went and spent over $30 in food and it had no lettuce charged full price and the tacos were so greasy they just fell apart. Dissatisfied to say the least.< /Review>

I do t ally understand what's is happening here, 35 minutes sitting stuck in the drive thru while passing through town...this is not FAST food and something has to give--you cannot hijack people this way. Hire good people, pay them well. Do not go to this location--worst experience I've ever had.< /review>

Good taco Bell. Mostly clean. Only issue is with ordering from automatic kiosk they don't give you the drink right away.</Text>

Food is usually pretty good the service is also pretty good. There just seems to be a lack of energy. The staff has always seemed to be run down and unmotivated. I want to ask them if they are being held against their will.  When you use your card to pay it will show up as something weird.< /review>

Most taco bells are the same across the board. This one does have a really good staff. If your coming late at night though the drive through can be really slow.</text>

GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Holy freaking hell. I sat in the drive thru for 25 min waiting for the car full of stoners in front of me to get their 4 bags worth of food, then when I got to the window, the guy took my payment and walked off. My one item hadnt even been made yet. Once I sat there for another 5 min and they finished it, the cook set it on the counter and started to walk off, but then saw me looking and handed it to me thru the window. When I drove around the corner, there were FOUR (4) GOD DAMN EMPLOYEES standing outside in a circle, SMOKING!! This happened at around 9:30pm on Thursday May 16th. Hopefully they get some more committed employees that have some customer service skills. Only one person should be allowed a break at a time right? There were more employees outside than inside.<//text>

This particular Taco hell is going down hill! They don't accept large bills( maybe they have a hard time counting change). Dirty for a chain fast food, incompetent tweaker employees! If your a taco bell fan, don't visit this one becasue it will ruin a good thing.</review>

It's a Taco Bell. Same menu as every other Taco Bell... Encheritos are long gone off the menu. Ordered a California Crunch Wrap for breakfast  it had NO ADVOCADO that's the whole reason for ordering it! Typical Taco Bell slow Drive Thru service & didnt get all my order. LIVE AND LEARN.<//text>

The workers never know what they are doing. They’re always in a rush to get things wrong. One time I forgot my card, and the guy at the window was very rude to me. I came back after I got my card and he handed me the food that was made the first time I was there. It was cold and my freeze was melted. This time I ordered 3 bean and cheese burritos and a 5-later burrito and I got 4 bean and cheese burritos and I got charged $9 for it. Management needs to do something about their employees. I’ve had the same guy both times (red head with glasses) and he’s very inefficient with his work. I would go to other Taco Bells if we had more.</text>

While the order was well taken, and they warned me of the wait, it took far longer than even they warned. The lobbies were messy and the staff looked rushed. Maybe if more people were working it would run better, but all in all it was a soso visit</Text>

Worst service ever. We waited over 30 mins for our food. The manager and cooks look like their on drugs. They were yelling and cussing at a customer, in front of my 4 year old granddaughter. I will never return there again.< /review>

<review>If you are in a hurry do not stop here.  Took twenty minutes to get two soft tacos.  Looked like a bunch of unsupervised working or should I say standing around talking to each other and not working.  Bathrooms were dirty and lobby needed cleaned and swept.  Definitely not the place for fast food.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

When we entered this Taco Bell, it felt very smelly inside.  We kept on thinking if we should eat inside or outside.  They don’t keep it cleaned at all. Tables floor was very dirty.  Its an ok place.<//review>

Food is never as ordered. This place CANNOT ever give you what you ordered and paid for, then the inept management act like its your fault that their staff can't do their jobs. Save your money and go somewhere else.</review>

I love Taco Bell. This Taco Bell will usually have fast service specially when the place is packed with high school students during the lunch rush hour.<//text>

CHECK YOUR ORDER!  This store always shorts orders.  Can ANYONE hired by this store count??  5 people making orders during slow time, and they still can't seem to make the correct order.</Review>

They had my order wrong and they didn't understand my order when I had clear my order. Seems I gave them a hard time just because I'm Deaf. After I left the place they miss out some of my order and I payed for it. I'm very disappointed. I'm sure not going back there.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>The last time I was here was almost a year ago.  My drink was terrible. and the 2 times before that. The only reason I visited this Peet's again is because of a free bday drink.  Tried to order it with their app (Android), but kept getting a pop up error.  Had no idea so many options existed to order my perfect drink!  Anyway I drove to the store and ordered.  The cleanest coffee shop I have ever seen!  My cafe mocha was delicious!!!  I used to be a regular 5 or 6 years ago then stopped because the quality of the brewed coffee and espresso drinks turned sub-par - even routed my rest stops here when I lead bike rides.  I'm super happy they are back to making tasty drinks again ... crossing my fingers it wasn't a fluke.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>One of the classic staples of coffee in the area, especially if you're shopping anywhere on the same lot.
You're probably familiar with the Peet's brand, so I'll assume you're looking for something bad in the reviews. They're great - grab some caffeine!</review><resp>None</resp><username>Scott Dee</username>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Like a college student walking into the comfort of their home after a semester away grinding, this Peet's Coffee feels like a quilt draped over my shoulders on a cold Texas night. The barista greeted me so sweetly, a sugar rush in and of itself. Mocha ordered, I fell back into the background to peruse the tools of their trade. Despite the pandemonium of the pandemic, the barista's hard work and dedication made me feel like everything would be alright. My mocha tasted the way a kiss feels: warm, exciting, and ever so sweet. Until next time Peet's, until next time.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Peet's really supports their employees and that alone is reason to give them your business. However, just give their coffee and hot chocolate a try.

This place is simply the top of coffee houses in the Torrance area. Their coffee is superb and their tea amazingly refreshing. They have lots of organic choices. They also offer great pastries at good prices. While you enjoy your beverage, you'll hear some wonderful classical music in the background which will help you relax away from busy life :) My favorite has to be the Pumpkin Coffee Latte, enjoy!<//Text>

Are negative integers allowed for ratings? If you need a stimulant to make you purge (vomit), then this coffee shop is your destination.< /review>

This is my favorite peets coffee store. Like to get the almond milk mocha.  Substitute the syrup for cocoa powder. Had new guy. Charged me about dollar too much.  Worth it still.< /Review>

Great ice tea. Friendly accommodating staff. Clean and positive atmosphere. Convenient for meeting up with others, studying, or sitting outside and enjoying drinks on their patio area. Will definitely be back and would definitely recommend to others.< /Text>

<Review>Peet's coffee has great coffee! In my opinion it's a step above Starbucks. I love the ambiance in Pete's the wood siding in the wood tongues has a cool calming effect on me. They have really good snacks too. This location is on Crenshaw and PCH right next to the whole foods market. doesn't really seem to be too crowded so you can usually walk right up and order whatever you want quickly and the service is nice.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd4a5af6c159fd:0x88525ebaf3da5c6a</Gmap_id></record>

My favorite coffee place. It's hard to find good decaf. If they're out, they'll brew it fresh for you. It's always good.< /text>

If I could give Peet's Coffee in Rolling Hills Plaza 6 stars, I would.  The coffee is top notch, the staff is terrific, the music is beautiful and the interior colors are relaxing.  The manager (Karen) of Peet's is a great leader, friendly and professional.  I'm so grateful Peet's is close to my home.<//review>

I've never liked Peet's especially and this store didn't do much to improve my opinion. I stopped in because it was convenient while I waited for a ride. The counter guy/manager took my money then brusquely told me with a thumb point over his shoulder that a guy down there would be handling my macchiato. Service was pretty quick, much faster than a Starbucks but thrn I was told that they would be closing in a few minutes and to hurry it up. I was not impressed and I won't be back by choice. Macchiato was good tho. Points for that.< /review>

<review>I came to Arena softball for my grandson's Pony League tryouts. I did not know this place existed. I found it interesting that they played softball indoors. I thought it was a great venue for Pony League tryouts given that no matter the weather conditions the tryouts could take place. They also had two large dispensers of water with cups for free. Thought this was a nice touch for the Youth Baseball League.

There is a snack bar that serves the usual fare of hamburger, fries, quesadilla, nachos. My son's family ordered plates of french fries ($4) that reminded me of the fries at 5 Guys. Orders are very large and were very good.

As for the softball experience. I asked a family friend if he had played there he said he had. It's an interesting concept to the softball game. It's completely different than regular softball. He said the game is continuous action and no matter where you hit the ball within the field it's in play. The softball diamond is completely netted in from top to bottom. There are spots on the back fence that are either a home run or an out depending on where you hit the ball. There's also a net covering the top of the baseball diamond that keeps the ball always in play.

As always please like if this review was helpful to you.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-Ocev2fL0r6yCwT-SnENwHPaVaH3RbGF-dprE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO64nyLvxQRaIeNMsdMceHLFa6f0M2GVEnkuM2O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSkCY7XK1ClTdowlSeWtFLAi322MXt-BSExaOg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOJhA0eD5puSYVSG8jZugOs6f0wBnmOTFAX0bO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrFL01dWnciGZho3MgYdSiLAejWPz3U-V8qw3D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8RN88S5l7mnSIM6Ya9-cCCKK7b-rgcODWVW7J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

Clean, Easy and cheap. Everything is in one place and easy to find. The service was a bit slow and my kids all had to share one cage because they are based on size.

All and all I will come back.</Text>

<text>This place is great! They have a great bar, good food, and two amazing indoor baseball fields. They also have several batting cages and a practice pitching mound. I totally recommend using them if you want to organize a baseball game. It would even be a good place for a kids baseball game, with a small collection of arcade games too.<//text>< gmapID>

<Text>We take our four-year-old here once in a while. I'm trying to teach my wife how to swing a bat. She's not very athletically inclined LOL. But it's fine. Limited selection of games but enough to keep a four-year-old busy. They have a bar. I can see when that place gets full of running energetic screaming kids that a beer or three would be ideal. This place is a lot of fun.<//Text>< username>

Great place for batting practice, a baseball or softball game, even kickball! Great food and drink options. We had our daughters birthday party here. The kids (and some parents too) played kickball and everyone had a blast! Definitely recommend!< /Text>

Indoor softball; it's a great concept, especially in the winter months. The facility is pretty nice inside. There are restrooms, party rooms, arcade games and a bar with great options like chicken wings and garlic fries! I enjoyed my time watching, eating and drinking.< /text>

Indoor batting cages, yeah! In addition,  there's a bar with a good selection, food (which, sorry, I haven't tried), arcade, and kick ball leagues for grown ups. 😊🤗 They also have party rooms for teams or birthdays to reserve.< /review>

Great place for indoor softball leagues, batting cages, or to just grab a drink. $3 beers are hard to beat and $2.50 for a batting session is a bit pricey. Wish that they had a discount when purchasing multiple batting sessions.
I've never had an issue with the cages. Not always down the middle and sometimes hard to understand the payment system (it shows remaining card value after you swipe, but it has already taken a credit before you select baseball/softball). I'll continue coming here for sure!< /text>

Very nice and clean indoor batting cages and perfect for playing baseball softball. Inside they have two tartan fields that can be played while it's raining outside! All amenities can be rented out for teams or parties. Mini arcade for kids while parents are able to get food and enjoy a well drink at the bar/restaurant inside. If you love beer you will love this place! Try the French fries....</Review>

Arena Softball is an amazing sport.  I too am surprised there are not more facilities around.  Yes, there are three or four coed teams who win the playoffs every time, but it is still fun to play.  It would be nice if they had an A, B and C league but I think they would need another facility for that to happen.< /review>

Softball only... The 10 foot was out of order. The lighting needs help, instead of the nights being straight down they should be at a 45 degree angle with one more row BEHIND the plate so players can see the ball. Right now lighting only lights the top of the ball. That makes it really hard to see the face of the ball coming st you...just saying<//Text>

Fun unique sport that is very different than the softball you're used to. Fast paced, high action.
The food and beer selection in the new sports bar is great too. Only complaint is since it is seat yourself the service can be very slow at times and you'll end up just having to try and order at the bar.< /Text>

<review>This place has it all for an indoor softball place. It has multiple batting cages for softball or baseball. It has two indoor softball arenas that softball or kickball is played on. There are multiple party rooms available. There is a snack bar that serves pizza, hot dogs, burgers etc. They also serve many different beers. They do get one star knocked off for their parking. The parking is limited and sometimes you are parking in the dirt/mud which can be a nuisance. This place is a little hard to find, you will not be able to see it from a car and you will need to map it on GPS the first text you get here. If you arrive from Industrial Rd you will need to leave from the other side as you cannot take a left back into Industrial Rd.<//review>< name>

With the remodel, they've improved tenfold. Better staff, improved cages, a full blown kitchen and bar. Prices are OK. I feel like if you don't eat and drink beer, then there isn't much love.< /text>

Great staff, fantastic birthday party with kickball, food drinks, batting cages and arcade games.  Big TV's for adults and food to order and beer on tap.  Easy place to hang out while kids are having a great time.</Review>

Not an easy place to find but when we did, the place was more than we expected.  Corn hole, arcade games, batting cages, surprisingly good food and a helpful and attentive staff.   Plenty of tv's to so you could almost call it a sports bar.  Ps... family friendly which is nice.<//review>

This place is going to H*** in a hand basket really quickly! You post a personal comment and they remove it and report it to admin! Talk about trying to control what their customers see! I have been playing and spending money here for over 7 years.... and just recently they've switched management and its just terrible. They no longer are taking into consideration the concerns of their softball customers all they care about is the new restaurant they added! There staff ignore the players who need water or even want to place a food order, I waited for over 10 minutes at their bar to have someone acknowledge me! If you love the game and don't care how you're treated then this is the place for you!<//Review>

I suggest just passing this one on by.

The dude running the place is the only person there working, if you can even call it that. Walking around in flip flops in a garage during the hours they are open doesn't really say much for him or this place.  Never saw any mechanics either, so it's just him. Funny thing is you see all these junky cars outside and around the building to make it "look" like he is soooooo busy.  He had my car 3 full days and never worked on it. The 3rd day he tells me it's the brakes.  Nope! Brakes are just fine.  Boyfriend told him we were coming to get my car and that was that.  Had to find another place....glad I did.  He just wasted my time.  So frustrating.

UPDATE!  7/2021 -- CLOSED DOWN AND NOW VACANT. Good riddance!</Text>

Went for an oil change and was told I needed brakes.. interesting how I just installed new brakes 20 minutes before arriving.  Not very honest.<//Review>

Avoid this place — cannot be trusted. Google said they open at 7AM. I arrived at 8:40 and nobody was there; phone just rang. Maybe due to being between Christmas and Nee Years, so I gave benefit of doubt despite any message or sign saying they would open at 9.
Said my brake job would be 2 hrs. I call 2 hrs later and we align on doing rear brake pads and rotors. He says it will be another 2 hrs. I call 4 hrs later and he says they are waiting for the parts. At this point it has been 6 hrs total and no work done and no phone call to tell me anything. He doesn’t know when the parts will arrive — mumbles something about “I have 36 hrs” as in he has 36 hrs to complete the work “legally”. No apology, just said he would call me when work was completed. Unbelievably unprofessional and will never come back here again.<//text>

< Review>
WARNING - STAY Away !! I called them before heading out. I was assured an oil change would take 20 minutes. We checked in at 12:25pm and he again assured us, it'd take 20 minutes. We left there at 3:30pm. There was ONLY 1 person working there which in itself is shocking for a garage with 4 bays. When I asked him where everyone else was, he said they were on vacation. He would disappear for long periods than reappear. In the 2.5 hours there, this guy did a total of 2 oil changes and NOTHING else. No less than 5 customers came after us and left when they realized he was the only person there, when they first couldn't even find anyone to check in with. I'm not a doctor, but I suspect there is something seriously wrong with this fella. I saw him walking around in shoes, then slippers then shoes again! At one point, I and another customer stood steps away from him, starting at him and he just ignored us while staring at his computer screen. I had wanted the 0W-20 oil as recommended for my vehicle, instead he just put 5W-30 without asking me. On the invoice he had the audacity to state that the customer declined this recommendation! He walks around aimlessly working at a snail's pace. This experience was by far the WORST customer experience I've ever had anywhere in my life. I wouldn't just not recommend this place, I'd warn people to stay away from this place, which is exactly what I told one customer who just got there as we finally got our keys and were on our way out.</Review>

<Text>I had been there for an oil changed and the mechanic told me I needed brakes which I knew. I appreciate his thoroughness. So I decide to let them do tune up and replace brakes on this visit . He dropped me off home and picked me up . It took longer than I’d like but the service was great .reasonable in price And of good quality. I’ll be coming back</Text>< Pictures>

He seems sweet but extremely unreliable with time.  Said the car will be done in 20min and was not finished until 1.5 hours later regardless of me telling him I had a doctor’s appointment for my condition (disability).  Then he disclosed my situation and laughed it off with his worker and other customers.  Very intimidating.</text>

<review>I came to them to get my back breaks worked on. I got my brakes replaced and ended up having to bring it back on the following Monday because all the break system lights were flashing. They told me to bring it in first thing in the morning, so they could work on it and I did! I dropped it off had to take the day off of work because something was broken and it stayed the overnight ANOTHER NIGHT! Poor communication, extremely unprofessional. When I came to pick up my car finally the owner of the establishment was pretty much laughing and a customer who was upset about them charging more than what they said originally. I am extremely disappointed about this whole experience. I will never go back again.
Also the establishment was very dirty and smelt like cigarettes in the waiting area, I ended up sitting out side on the curb because it was very dirty.</review>< pics>

We sent two cars for repair, one car has not been fixed but charged couple of hours labor anyway; the other car repair was over charged for a simple installation of a small parts. I do not recommend this shop to anyone!<//Text>

<Text>Fast and friendly service!!! I had a flat tire with locked rims and i didnt have the key for the lug nuts and they were able to take the tire off for repair without breaking the lug nuts in the process.  They had me in & out in 30 minutes and it was a very inexpensive.  Will be going back if i ever need to.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Today I called for a warranty repair of a muffler job from 6 months ago, the muffler tip FELL OFF while driving and my Ford dealer advised it was due to a bad weld during install. When I called Meinecke Aliso Viejo, they answered only 'HELLO'. I said my name and asked, 'whom am I speaking with'? The guy responded 'what do you want'? Such a great start. I advised what happened, and he told me to contact a different Meinecke then hung up the phone. I called back and asked for his name and he refused to give me his name and said I was giving him problems. What  type of customer service is this? Just like their phone system advises of being recorded, I recorded the call too. I've called Meinecke corp and have opened a complaint, they can have a copy of the awful experience I had on the call with Albert. I'M YOUR CUSTOMER, ALBERT.

< Review>
Albert is Aliso Viejo’s most trusted mechanic. He does pick up and drop offs for customers who need a ride home nearby. He explains exactly what your car needs and will try to get the lowest possible price for parts. It’s so hard to find an honest mechanic. And that is why his shop is always so busy. His customers have spread the word.< /Review>

One star :...not greeted, management not friendly, not thanked when I left.
The nicest person there was the Hispanic man that took my order!..I’m sorry I don’t know his name ...he was very friendly. The Managers were grumpy, not explaining anything. The waiting room and chairs were filthy. As much as I don’t like Jiffy Lube, they are four-star compared to Meinicke. I’m not going back to Meinicke nor Jiffy Lube! Valvoline will be my go to oil change place.< /Review>

I locked my keys phone & money in my truck & this location wouldn't help unless I had $25 cash...which was locked in my truck. In any case..instead of being a good samaritan I had to ask for help  from about anyone for about an hr until a good samaritan did give me money to give to this place to unlock my doors. Do good deeds even exist anymore? It's people & places like this that could gain a customer for just maybe helping a stranded person out.<//review>

< review>
DO NOT GO. I went to Meineke for new front brakes. They told me I needed new pads and rotors on the front, and they told me there are 2 options 1st is original pads, and other is cheaper coz it's duplicated. I decided to go with original one. So I paid and got new brakes & rotors. About 10 days later again I having brake problems. When I search around I figure out they installed very cheap pads which causes smell, noise and already damaged the new rotors.  Took my car back to them, and they told me they are busy and don't have chance to look at. And I need to get it back to them in the morning and don't go to work. I still had serious issues, and haven't fixed yet.<//review>

<UserId.>100716441958911590536<//UserId.><review>I started using Meineke recently as I had some issues with my vehicle that my current mechanic could not fix. I have been very impressed with the level of service, and the low prices at this location. The guys are great. They spotted a few things on my vehicle that could use some attention, but did not try and sell me on them. I really appreciate their approach. They have been very flexible, and very reasonable with me. They allow me to supply my own oil and filters as I'm a bit picky, and even allow me to source parts if I can find a better deal.

I'm sad that I have found a very good shop that I trust, but will be moving out of the area soon.<//review><rate>5</rate><Gmap_id>0x80dce8a38f95d8b7:0x3edd225e28c95585< /Gmap_id>< date>

<review>The crew here were not only friendly but helped keep me calm since my work truck (which I had just spent $500 on to get the problem fixed) was not running well (max speed 35mph). I was frustrated, stressed and basically lost in regards to how to get my truck running again .  They even offered me a loaner car!! Which I gladly accepted. I would definitely recommend this garage to anyone especially woman cause I know these are good honest mechanics that would never do work if it wasn't needed.</review>< userid>

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ ALL THE 1-STAR REVIEWS BELOW ABOUT THIS SHOP ON YELP AS WELL.

Do not bring your car here. I brought my like new, perfect condition sports car here to have the brakes inspected for a minor squeak. After talking with the owner/mechanic Albert about the issue, I determined he was a completely incompetent owner/mechanic, trying to rip me off for a complete set of new brakes that my car absolutely did not need. I needed to get my car out of there and was working late so I had my wife pick it up before they closed and bring it home which is right around the corner from this shop.

Even though that was a really annoying experience for me, that is not what I am writing this review about. Plenty of people have already shared that same experience here on Yelp about this place.

What I am writing about is the fact that when my car was picked up it had a broken windshield that it absolutly did not have when the car was dropped off and was in their possession all afternoon. I am never one to point blame for something unless I am 100% sure. I had all night to think about it, rule out any other possibilities of where and how this could have happened and without a doubt determined this happened at this shop while they were working on it. 100%.

I went back to the shop this morning right when they opened to address this incident with them. Albert the owner/mechanic who worked on my car just laughed at me and said there was no way that happened at his shop and turned around and walked away. Completely blowing me off and not even showing any concern at all about the damage to my car. He was not willing to even consider the possibility that this damage could have happened at his shop, or discuss anything with me at all. I have absolutely no reason to blame them if I had any doubt in my mind that this was damaged at his shop. He was not willing to do anything at all except laugh at me and completely deny any responsibility.

After reading Yelp reviews about Albert and his business, the way he treated me was not a fluke. This is how he runs this business. Be aware. Do not do business with this shop. I will be filing complaints with the BBB and filing a small claims suit with Albert and his shop.

Also interesting-
My wife had commented that when she showed up to pick up the car, they were really, over the top, extremely friendly and nice, said the inspection was no charge, dropped what they were doing to walk her straight to the car, opened her door for her to get her out of there ASAP.

When I dropped the car off, I had to go find someone to help me and I did not experience anything like what my wife did. It sure seems to me that they were trying to get her out of there as fast as they could in the friendliest way possible.....   Hmmmm.</review>

I have been going to Albert for almost 10 years. Don't believe those fake reviews all of those people have left as they are just after a free oil change that is all. My In laws use him as does my dad when he is in town from out of state. I have never been over charged or asked to buy anything that was not needed.

Albert also gives a cash discount, all you have to do is ask.<//Review>

I would leave less than a one star if possible. I took my car in for a FULL BRAKE INSPECTION and instead all they did was slap on some new brake pads without doing an inspection. Then 2 months down the road, I was driving down the road and my car wouldn't stop, it only slowed down. I immediately took it to the shop and explained to them the issue. Well now they are trying to charge me to correct the issue that was their fault in the first place. They did a mickey mouse job and I could have gotten into a terrible car accident. They told me that all they did was change the pads because they didn't think changing my brake fluid was necessary. I'm sorry but last I checked, when the brake pads are being replaced, you are supposed to change the fluid as well as bleed the air out of the brake line WHICH THEY DIDNT DO. Now I am stuck paying for something that wasn't my fault.
To top all of this off, they caused $1900 worth of damage to my parents Mercedes as well! They put the oil filter on BACKWARDS! What kind of mechanics are you guys hiring? Albert is the worst of all! He is a liar and a thief! I highly doubt the owner is any better considering the amount of shady work they have done. I am going to report them to the better business bureau. This place needs to be shut down!! Every negative review that has been posted is 110% accurate. DO NOT GO HERE! THEY WILL CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE TO YOUR CAR JUST TO TRY AND GET YOU TO COME BACK AND SPEND EVEN MORE!!! DON"T TRUST THEM!

UPDATE:
I was bribed with a free oil change if I would take down my bad review. After taking my car back in for them to fix the issue, I am having problems with the brakes AGAIN. Do not get your car serviced here unless you are prepared to have costly repairs done after they work on your car. The corporate office still hasn't helped with resolving this issue.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Save your time and money! I’m not the type of person to normally go out of my way to write a negative review but these guys really earned it. This Meineke is scandalous and disreputable. Everything they're supposedly doing is unclear and the business has a sketchy, money-laundering sort of vibe to it. The loaner cars are always empty on gas with the check-engine lights on and no current registration… and if that doesn’t tell you enough right there keep on reading because it only gets better! This Meineke is truly the most unprofessional business I’ve ever seen run. It’s ironic that this place is called a service shop because the only thing they do is disservice and inconvenience people. It's a splendid place to waste your time and money without getting your vehicle maintained, fixed or repaired at all!
Based off of a recommendation from a co-worker I took my 2002 BMW in to get a quote on a repair for a check-engine light and an idling issue. The check-engine light was from two lean codes: P0173 & P0174. Meineke quoted the repair at $1,000 including parts and labor. The parts included any sensors, gaskets, valves, etc. that may have been producing the lean codes. So I went ahead and paid the $1,000 for them to "fix" it. Around a week later when they "finished" the repair they told me the idle issue was gone and the car was no longer running lean but that for some reason the check-engine light refused to turn off. So Meineke quoted me another $450 to rebuild the ECM and turn off the check-engine light...  I know what you’re saying.. DON’T DO IT. Well I made yet another mistake and paid them another $450 to "rebuild" the ECM. This time the check-engine light turned off, but the car started idling rough again. They assured me everything was fine and the car would not exhibit any more idling issues. Low and behold about a month later (<500 miles) the car started idling so badly it became undrivable.. it’d stall out at stop signs, turns, etc… just like it would before I brought into Meineke for repairs. When I brought it back in to diagnose it, they said their OBCDII was reading all "new codes" and it would cost another $1,500 to fix. I was a bit upset! I asked “how is it possible that the car is exhibiting the exact same symptoms that you just supposedly ‘fixed’ with all brand new codes only 500 miles later? Did you actually fix anything or did I just pay $1,500 for no reason?”…  They gave me some non-sense spiel about how it’s very common for cars over 10 years old to throw brand new engines codes every week. LOL. Must just be the cars they work on at Meineke :P  What’s funny is the display on the dash had no check-engine light at all... so none of this even made any sense. At this point it was very evident that they didn't actually fix a single thing the first time. And get a load of this… When I asked for a receipt with a break-down of the parts & labor, they gave me a receipt with my vehicle information and somebody else's name on it. What a joke! If you’re too irresponsible to get my name & vehicle information correct how can I trust you to repair my car? I am a very cool & collected person, but it really did take everything in me to not go swinging at the mechanic who said, "Hey my friend, I'll take the car off your hands for $500!".. REALLY??? After you gladly charged me $1500 to "fix" it, now you want to buy it from me for $500? And you just quoted me another $1500 to sink into it?... C’mon lol. Why would you want me to put keep pouring so much money into the car if it’s only worth $500? I’ll tell you why. These guys are slimy, unethical scum who are undeserving of anyone’s time or money. Save yourself the trouble, do not go here. I am currently in the process having a real auto-shop diagnose the vehicle to see if they actually did any work. I’ll update this review later when I find out if they actually did any repairs or just further damaged the vehicle..</review>< pictures>

<text>Worst mechanic in southern California!!! They are not Honest at all, they will tell you you need new parts to fix a problem then tell you it didn't fix the problem and you need more work. You will bring your vehicle in for work they say that they can perform. Only to find out they took it to another auto shop For the work! They have used my truck to haul  other people's auto parts. And I'm not talking about them putting a boxed part in the bed, I am talking about break calipers and rotors unboxed on my floor mats. They have never put a floor mat protector down so I end up spending an hour or two trying to get the grease out of my floor mats afterwards. I am truly disgusted by the service offered here.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Giving a 2 because I don't know how tomorrow will go. Today I took in my car for a simple brake pad and rotor swap. They quoted me 2 hours max and I made it clear that we live in Fullerton and will stay in the area based on that time estimate. Mark tells me he'll call me as soon as it's ready. After a 2.5 hour dinner we drive by to check the progress... shop is closed, not a single call from them. Now my wife has to drive me to work and I get to take an uber to the shop on my lunch to pick up my car that should've been ready tonight. Will update this with their solution tomorrow.<//review>< pictures>

I brought my 2009 Camry for a Engine replacement about two months ago. Albert Kwon the Manager said that it would cost 2200 to get an engine replacement. almost a month passed by before Albert can locate this engine. i picked up the car on 9/23/17. not even a month after the engine to this car broke down on me in the middle of the freeway. I towed this car back to Albert to get it fixed UNDER WARRANTY just like he agreed.  My car was sitting in front of the shop for almost 3 weeks i drove by every day to see whether they were working or not.   i called Albert two weeks ago to check on the progress of the vehicle. Albert informed me that the company hes bought the engine from is not covering the warranty and that i am need to pay him another 1500 to buy a new engine. I told Albert i wanted a running car by the end of the week and that's it.  I came by last Saturday with the Orange County Sheriffs to pick up my vehicle. to make sure that i do not just drive off with my car ALBERT had the keys changed to my car. after fighting with him for almost an hour Albert said that I could take my property if i pay for the key. Basically i ended up paying $350 for a car that should have been under warranty. not only that the car runs like a damn lawnmower i don't understand how this guy is still in business or how he even sleeps at night DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR TO THIS SHOP EVER< /Text><pics>None</pics><Name>Mohammed Al Smadi<//Name>< Date>

Honestly, if I could give 0 stars I would. They are always claiming to have deals but when you go in the prices are jacked so high up that the deal ends up giving you the same price of a full. Right now they have a 50% off of brakes, we go in and with the coupon they say it’s $300 for just my front brakes. You’re telling me it’s $600 for a brake replacement?  Not to mention they filled my windshield wiper fluid with water. So when i took a trip out west this winter it froze.They are crooks who just care about making money not quality. I will never go back here and I warn anyone who needs major work done to not go here because you will get ripped off and I doubt anything will even get fixed.</Text>

They are RUDE at this location and lied to us. They said they replaced parts, but in fact did not. They wanted more money when I complained, then threatened to call the police when I told them I wanted what I paid for initially. They are a scary, unprofessional bunch and we will NEVER go there again. Two other customers agreed with me out in the parking lot and left the store too. BEWARE of these unscrupulous people!!!!!< /text>

<text>Took my 3013 Hyundai in for brakes because I heard a metal grinding noise. They replaced the front brakes for over $250 and said the noise would stop within a couple days. It was still grinding so I took it back. Now they said it needed back brakes, another $200. Still heard the grinding noise. Turns out they used inferior products, refused to warranty their work, and in the end I was forced to replace the front pads AND rotors in less than 20K miles. Disgusted, would never recommend. Thank you to MIDAS for fixing their abysmal work!< /text>< Pics>

Two hours n still waiting for a tire repair. They didn't even have to take tire off. told them late for work. Ignored and all cars that drove up with no appts taken first and greeted at their car while we just stood there waiting. Customer service horrible. Finally asked what hold up was..understaffed I was told.researched n  Told my son found another place down the road..well they jumped all over it. Would never come here again..awful customer service. If i could give them a zero i would. Just on customer service only.<//Review>

<Text>Albert Kwon, the manager is a crook. Took my car there 3 months ago to install new brake pads and resurface rotors. He said the pads were the wrong ones and he'll put original OEM pads instead and charged me an extra 100 to put the 'right ones' in. He started work on it without consulting me that it'll be an extra $100, basically holding my car hostage. Either pay what we agreed on with the job incomplete and no new pads, or pay an extra $100 so you can get your car back. This was super slimy but I had no choice but to pay that extra $100.

Three months later, my front brakes have been squealing badly, getting louder as time goes by, took it back and Albert says the parts are not original and that's the reason they're making noise even though I paid an extra $100 to have him put original OEM pads!  I kept asking and insisting he clarify what parts are not original, he avoided the question and refused to answer.  Then he changes his tune and was telling us we are not driving the car right and you have to 'press on the brakes harder' to make the noise go away.. and he 'recommended another $500 brake job so the squealing goes away'... Wow!

When I asked for paperwork, he walked away, avoided eye contact, then told his employees to call the police because we're not leaving.  This is the worst customer service I've experienced, I'm shocked at how Albert refused to answer simple questions, avoided, ignored, and refused to fix the problem.  My dad who's a senior citizen with complications was not taking this well, so I had to calm him down for the sake of his health and leave the place.. Unbelievable!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>Came in for a standard oil change the other day. The manager (Albert) is a liar and a thief..... He drained the hydronic fluid In my truck so that my clutch didn't work. I've never had any problems with my clutch until the morning after I had service from this place.....SHADY business!!! Luckily I knew that I had a brand new clutch so I checked the fluid and replaced it in time..... Do yourself a favor and Stear clear of this place.< /Review>< Rate>

Very neat and tidy store, great selections. Although I arrived for a vaccine, I left a happy customer with me new ice chest and cold packs. Of course the saving I received were a plus.</review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>This store has pros and cons, which keeps it from being listed higher as a go-to grocery store for this area.  North Natomas is lucky to have several choices, and the experience of parking in their tight lot, dodging store displays with your cart, and clogging up aisles to wait for checkout usually has me stressed out by the time I get home.  If you don't mind these things, you will be all set.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1621033612864, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear about your experience Ben, we have shared your concerns with the Store Director for the Sacramento location.

< Review>
The workers here are absolutely amazing.

I wish I had taken down everyone's names.

I was doing DoorDash orders and everyone there was so helpful in my distress (the app doesn't really help with shopping).

Thank you Safeway workers!< /Review>

<text>On $5 Friday, I shopped at this Safeway because Peete's Coffee was only $5 a box. I strolled over to the deli to pick up a $5 whole chicken. There was only one chicken in the warmer, which was inside a bag wide open. Since the bag was wide open, I chose to ask Deli personnel if they had more chickens available. There were two females making a sandwich and one male washing something in a sink. Another customer was waiting. No Safeway staff asked us if we needed help or informed us of the wait time. I commented that I had just one question. The man washing at the sink spoke no English. The sandwich makers were rude and laughed about my question. At least one of the women said that she would check to see if there were more whole cooked chickens. As I waited I watched a deli guy go over to the chicken warmer, take the opened chicken bag, reseal it and put it back in the warmer. I couldn't believe it during these days of the pandemic. Needless to say, I will never shop at this Safeway, again. The store is dirty, the checkers are slow, and the del personnel are illiterate at best.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1617598313874, 'text': 'Hello Cynthia, we are sorry to hear about your experience with our Deli.

A regular Safeway with a gas station out in front. I would give it 4 stars but this shopping center parking lot is so small for that many tenants. So, expect lots of traffic.< /review>

The store itself is clean and fine enough, but in the morning the location is packed with people picking up stuff for work and school, and there is only one checkout counter open. The line is outrageous. It looks like the self checkout counters don't open until after 8:00 a.m.<//Review>

Worst customer service and overly priced items! Was in the self-check out line for 30 minutes because the system kept spitting out error after error 😩 wow what a joke! And the self check out woman appeared frustrated with us because the POS kept calling for help. She didn’t say anything as if we were inconveniencing her at work! Go somewhere else ppl-you can do better.</review>

21 Nov 20: Went to Safeway this Saturday and 2 women where going through store with NO MASK. I’m not sure what the age for kids is but her older child wasn’t either.
The Sprouts across the street demands and enforces MASKS.
Will not return until after this pandemic.< /Review>

< review>
Please remodel this store and repave the entire parking lot, get rid of the RV park in front and the homeless camps around the block and having them ask for handouts outside.  The security team needs to keep the parking lots clear. Seek a permits to have the curb in front of the store red curbed or handicapped marked to avoid those RVs.  Inside the store, I watched this woman (with her poor green dyed dog) shoplift live, stuff her yellow bag, while she shoved the hand cart inside the shelves.  I reported it and was told the brand new security guard is afraid of dogs.  The other guard was on a break.  Maybe fine tune the security team??  These problems are fixable, NO?</review>

Kinda expensive on some products then other stores but all in all good customer service except at self check out the lady that was assisting the customers kinda jumped to conclusions that we didn't count one the items but it had she did apologize tho. But was a little embarrassing when she raised her voice to get our attention it also got everyone's attention there. I just laughed it off that's why I'm only giving 3 stars.😌< /text>

I enjoy coming to safeway. I love how everything is so organized and items are stocked. The bakery has a huge selection of baked goods. FYI I always order my cupcakes here. (they are delicious) Have ordered a few birthday cakes from safeway. If you have a picture of a cake you'd like them to bake/decorate more than likely they can get it done for you. One layer, two layered cakes- they got you. I enjoy coming here during the holidays. They have variety of baked goods with the holiday colors, decor. Just recently I bought 2-24 packs of Halloween uniced sugar cookies & there pre packaged 3 frosting variety pack with sprinkles. Come on fridays or Mondays and enjoy the $5 deals....... check there ad, they sure have good deals for card members.

Good tri tip.

They have all the fruits in season, huge selection of toiletries and OTC medicine.
Overall I enjoy this place!</review>

Out of rotisserie chicken at 6:30pm. Went to order fried chicken mixed and they were out of breasts. Added some wings to my order and the guy handed them to me and left before I could order some potatoe wedges. I stood in the same place for nearly 5 minutes until he came back from behind the wall and realized I was still there. The fried chicken was stale and the wings had a hard lemon  flavor. Horrible food and customer service. I was expecting equal service from my Vons stores in southern CA since they are the same owners.</Text>

< Review>
If you must
I am usually very pleased  with Safeway but this store misses the mark. This review is based on breakfast and lunch orders at this location for the past two days.  On Day 1 I noticed the deli area was pretty deserted and waited for assistance. I watched employees yelling back and forth for supplies and stocking shelves. After about 3 minutes I asked for assistance and once again the yelling began. Eventually I received rushed assistance. Before my sandwich was out of the oven another worker was called to assist with the register. I told her my order and that I wanted Advocodo. She asked the lady making the sandwich if I had Advocodo to which she immediately replied no! However she had never asked me about wanting anything on the sandwich. After that, the lady at the register totalled my item twice and could not figure out how to correct it. It took her four transactions to get my total correct.

Fast forward to Day 2 (today). The experience in the morning was again less than desirable.  People were yelling for numbers at the register because they could not check out customers. The deli worker was much nicer. She provided me with a great sandwich. Lunch was a mess! Again the deli staff was limited or yelling for assistance. There was only chicken and Mac n cheese in the hot deli. The few hot wings in the case looked as though they'd been there all day. When questioned about potato wedges, we were told we'd have to wait for them to be dropped and cooked. I ended up getting a chicken meal with Mac n cheese and Chinese chicken salad. After I ordered the person behind me insisted they check the back for wedges and they were sitting waiting to be brought to the front. I just laughed. The chicken good but the Mac n cheese was not! It was watered down and barely tasted of cheese; it was just creamy. The Chinese chicken salad was the worst ice ever had. I can't even begin to tell you what that was!?

The store was clean but the deli needs help! Safeway has a good reputation for the deli. This location is not a good look!</Review>

<review>I do a good amount of shopping at Safeway. It's my go to store for their bakery. Great cakes, specialty breads and pastry.  A great variety at a fair price. Staff is helpful and courteous. I also like the fresh meat counter.  Good variety here too. Then I get to fill my car with discounted gas!  Not a bad deal at all!!🙂🙂🙂🙂<//review>< Pictures>

<Date>1606254228657</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>This is my 2nd bad experience. 1st I didn't have all my groceries & had to drive back to the store to get all my groceries. 2nd & recent I arrived at the store and waited for over 30 minutes for my order after 3 calls to the store in addition a person arrived after me & received their order before me. When I inquired about it the excuse from the person that delivered my order was that it was 10 people came into the store so I guess obviously that meant they needed to be taken care of first even though I was a waiting customer. It was such an unacceptable excuse & he was very rude in his delivery. I requested a manager and was advised I needed to go in the store to address my concern.The whole point of pickup & go is that I don't have to get out of my car & go into the dog on store AND they charged me .10c for an additional bag that I did not receive. I'm so disappointed & irritated & I know we're all experiencing bad times but the lack of empathy & the disregard for customer service is mind boggling. I will think twice before ordering from Safeway's drive up & go.< /review>< pictures>

If you must
I am usually very pleased  with Safeway but this store misses the mark. This review is based on breakfast and lunch orders at this location for the past two days.  On Day 1 I noticed the deli area was pretty deserted and waited for assistance. I watched employees yelling back and forth for supplies and stocking shelves. After about 3 minutes I asked for assistance and once again the yelling began. Eventually I received rushed assistance. Before my sandwich was out of the oven another worker was called to assist with the register. I told her my order and that I wanted Advocodo. She asked the lady making the sandwich if I had Advocodo to which she immediately replied no! However she had never asked me about wanting anything on the sandwich. After that, the lady at the register totalled my item twice and could not figure out how to correct it. It took her four transactions to get my total correct.

Fast forward to Day 2 (today). The experience in the morning was again less than desirable.  People were yelling for numbers at the register because they could not check out customers. The deli worker was much nicer. She provided me with a great sandwich. Lunch was a mess! Again the deli staff was limited or yelling for assistance. There was only chicken and Mac n cheese in the hot deli. The few hot wings in the case looked as though they'd been there all day. When questioned about potato wedges, we were told we'd have to wait for them to be dropped and cooked. I ended up getting a chicken meal with Mac n cheese and Chinese chicken salad. After I ordered the person behind me insisted they check the back for wedges and they were sitting waiting to be brought to the front. I just laughed. The chicken good but the Mac n cheese was not! It was watered down and barely tasted of cheese; it was just creamy. The Chinese chicken salad was the worst ice ever had. I can't even begin to tell you what that was!?

The store was clean but the deli needs help! Safeway has a good reputation for the deli. This location is not a good look!</Review>

I will never shop there again!!! They have been terrible through the Pandemic to their customers!! I totally understand protecting themselves but there is ABSOLUTELY NO excuse for not only NOT respecting the customers social distance but actually stepping over and reaching over your head lodging your NOSE in their arm pit with NO notice of needing to be in that space when you are in the line and space directing you to stand. When I asked them to respect the social distances totally ignored me and would not even look at me!!!</text>

<review>The store is laid out pretty nicely. Things were fairly easy to find. Prices are always higher at Safeway so we weren't "sticker shocked." Everything seemed to be in order except the toilet paper, but considering the crazy toilet paper shipping going on right now, I guess you'd have to expect that. The shopping carts were in good working order and seemed clean which is a plus! The only thing that seemed less than 5 star worthy was the clerk ringing us up. He spent way too much time taking to the shoppers. There was a big line and he didn't seem to have any sense of it. He just kept talking and bagging a few items and then stopping to talk etc. It would be fine if he was bagging just as much as he was talking and getting shoppers in and out faster. Anyways, we got what we needed and left eventually.</review><gmapID>0x809b29e4bbd7614f:0x69365083d64b8282<//gmapID>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This Safeway is in a very clean and safe location, even if you decide to shop really early or late in the evening.

This part of Natomas is rapidly growing. A new upper scale apartment complex is currently being built right behind this little strip mall and there is more being built nearby as well as a medical facility and other larger businesses being strategically placed throughout the area.  A Safe CU is also currently in the process of inhabiting one (of the 2) vacant businesses within this plaza.

The store has extended hours, in the morning, for seniors, pregnant women and new Moms (Dads), as well as anyone that is considered to be higher risk.

This Safeway seems to always (or almost always) keep full stock and hardly ever runs out of product(at least the ones that I purchase).  The staff are energetic, happy (trying to greet people as they walk in) and helpful (most of the time there is a clerk within an aisle or two of where you are), and are very eager to assist in finding whatever uou are looking for or to answer any questions you may have (about other area businesses, directions, how to cook something in particular).

The prices can bea bit high,when compared to places like foodmax, however, their products are of higher quality (fresh meats and produce lasting much longer amd with much better flavor), and if you utilize your Safeway Club Card, which is as easy as entering your phone number during checkout, you not only get more comparable prices, but discounts on gas, extra coupons, etc.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
So upset, so I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. I ordered a cake for my sons birthday, asked for a light color grey on the outside of the cake with a raider image on the top. When i went to pick up the cake, not only was the side of the cake smashed but you could barely see the image because the cake was so dark. I was trying  to do something a little special for my son by having the image put on. Anyway the cashier at bakery dept felt really bad and called the manager. The store manager Derick Amado came and looked at the cake and says ok I'm really sorry i can give you the cake for $10  he didn't even seem that sincere. I felt like it was a take it or leave it kind of thing. Still really upset and the thing is this is the second time I've had an issue. The last time is was for my 11 yr old son and that time i ordered a cake it was the fruit they messed up on. I ordered bananas and we got strawberries and my son is allergic to strawberries so he couldn't even have his own cake. We had to go buy him.another little one so he could have some cake even though it wasn't what he wanted. Sorry i feel like another birthday is ruined.</Review>

Great, hectic, as usual. People trying to buy last minute stuff knowing that at  some point soon, they're going to just keep putting more restrictions, as to how much we can move about. But staff is as helpful as possible, customers helping keep everyone else calm too.<//review>

I've shopped at the location here on del Paso boulevard off of I-5 for the last five years and at least two times a week sometimes three and during this pandemic the customer service has been terrible The store hours have been spotty.  not only have I realized that my prices for groceries have gone up about 22% during this last 5 months but being turned away an hour early from when there are posted hours as in tonight 10:00 p.m. when they're open till 11:00 is ludicrous.... I sat here tonight for about 10 minutes after I argued with the lady that it's posted online on their own company website that they're open till 11:00 and I watched her turn away about 40 people to which I completely told all of them raley's is open for another hour down the street so I'm just very tired of companies being so short-sighted and refusing service when again I just verified that's what's posted on their own site</review>

The store is always clean and tidy. However, the space between the cash registers and the isles is very small making it very difficult to stand in line when there is more than one person waiting. If you go on Friday evenings, it gets very crowded.< /review>

< review>
Store was posted online as being open until 5pm on Christmas day. 5pm closing time was also posted on their door.  Arrived at 4:15pm to get items for dinner. I live on the other side of town and Safeway was the only store open. When I arrived myself along with other shoppers were told we could not come in because the employees wanted to go home to their families and they needed customers to stop coming in so they could leave on time. I get that, but poor planning on the stores part does not mean that you turn customers away because they are an inconvenience.  I didn't bring my cell phone with me so I wasn't able to look up locations of other Safeways or their closing times. I drove across town, wasted my gas, drove back home with nothing, and by the time I got back home it was too late to get to another store. Just discouraging and I felt the store really dropped the ball here. I was there almost a full hour before closing and was told too bad. I understand wanting to be with family on Christmas, but if you are a business and say you are open then you should be open. My time with family and gas money was also lost for no reason.</review>

I don't suggest buying the individually wrapped doughnuts since all frosting is stuck to the bags they are packaged in. Also, not all employees wear masks correctly.</text>

I have been following
Safeway on Instagram since they opened and finally got to order some flowers today! Ordering them is so easy! You can go online and complete a form and specify your budget and preference! I picked purple since it's my friend's favorite color. I was completely satisfied! It's super affordable and pleasantly beautiful!<//Text>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Thos store overall is great, we shop here quite frequently. We love the over savings with Safeway, and majority of the employees are friendly and helpful.
However, cashier Ricardo is very unprofessional and rude. Our encounters with him have been extremely frustrating. We really like cashiers Terence, Dianne and Murina. Those 3 are always so nice and welcoming, especially when we have a tired, fussy baby in a very packed store with just a couple open cashier lanes</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I just recently moved to the area from downtown Sacramento. I routinely order sandwiches from the Safeway deli. I’ve called this location twice now and on neither occasion was I able to successfully place my order over the phone. The first time I was told that they didn’t know if they’d have time today. I couldn’t believe it! It was 5:30 and I was in the produce section so I went over and made my order. Annoying. Today I waited 13 minutes to speak to someone to be told that they are short staffed and that they’d take my name and number and call me back. I’m just baffled by the complete lack of care. They need some changes in management at this store.< /Text>

The personal shopper was helpful and accomidating. They tried to  put in custard filled doughnuts in place of Eclairs. I had said no substitutes and selected the free coupon.  I was not impressed by this service.</Review>

Conveniently located off of Highway 5 on Del Paso Road. This location has a Starbucks inside of it as well as Jamba Juice. Us bank location is located inside on the right hand side of the store.  Super clean location, all staff is extremely friendly. The gas is the cheapest gas I have found  here in Sacramento. I have always been treated fairly by staff at this location. I would highly recommend this location!<//Text>

<Review>I came in the store in the morning and needed some help with flowers and arrangements. I come into the store all the time considering I live in the area.

As working in a retail environment myself, I was not greeted or asked if i needed any help. Being in the front end of the store you should have great customer service and Olivia DID NOT! She was extremely rude to me, could not be bothered in helping me any way shape or form. I tried asking for some help and i ended up with rude short ended answers. She would cut me off mid sentence and try and shut me up as i was talking or asking questions. And whisper under her breath as i was leaving. Making me feel very uncomfortable and extremely under valued and i felt like a big bother. Not once have i felt this way in this store. Its obvious that Olivia does not want to be there.

I have always had great customer service from Joyce, Jessica, and Tania as they normally help me with my arrangements. This situation has made me feel completely uncomfortable and i will no longer continue to shop the floral section while Olivia is present. She has the worst customer service i have ever had!< /Review>< resp>

<Review>The place itself is conveniently located. Most of the staff is friendly and professional. The prices are fair according to today's wages, it also helps that I have the Safeway card. (I have had it since like way back in the days that they started the program) The parking lot is plentiful, but people are impatient and if you don't keep your eyes open and look both ways you're going to get hit, ran over or into a fender bender. Be safe out here!< /Review><userid>106477225613852202600</userid><Name>Walter Calderón</Name>< Date>

<Review>All of the employees that I dealt with are very helpful and willing to help.   All of the employees really work hard.  Their prices are good.  The outstanding employees go over and above:  Susan, Maretta, Courtney, and Danny the asst mgr mgr was always helpful.  Danny has been sent to a different store now.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This is my old timer store, I've been shopping here since I can remember , I'm not going to denied that the prices went a little bit up ( at least to me) but the produce is always fresh , the prepared food taste so good and freshly made, the meat is always good quality and the store is always clean.  The people who works there are so friendly and honest ( once I forgot my purse on a shopping car, and later on as soon as I got home, the manager from the store called my husband and he called me letting me know what I forgot in the store, plus some of the groceries I already paid for) I know right .. TRULY THANKFUL 🤩🤗❤< /text>

<Review>Good Safeway but when I had a couple different questions for associates, they couldn't answer them, like one in the deli about a type of meat.. People who work there should know about the area they work in! Safeway in general is pretty expensive too but happy for some sales. Overall pretty good compared to others!< /Review>< GmapID>

Always cool employees. I love their sandwiches. Store is usually organized and clean. Cashiers are usually pretty fast and friendly too! Gas lines are long but worth it because it's usually cheaper.</Text>

< Review>
This is specifically a review on Welma at the signature cafe, the lady that was called over to help make our breakfast sandwiches.  She did not take time to listen to our orders and we had to repeat twice. She was extremely rude when asking us for our order and got even more rude when we has to repeat ourselves.  At the end of the transaction, I said thank you and she ignored me completely. So then I repeated my self a little louder so rest of customers could hear and she finally replied with a thank you.  EXTREMELY RUDE EMPLOYEE WITH TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS< /Review>

<Review>I want to like this location more, but it's either the layout or the lack of staff or ... something.  My blood pressure always goes up after a visit here.  North Natomas is lucky enough to have choices for supermarkets, and I'll go to the others before this one.<//Review>< GmapID>

The worst part about this Safeway is the parking lot.  The parking lot has a terrible layout and its difficult to get in and out of.  Inside, the store is clean and usually well stocked but they only keep 2-3 registers open during lunch and the afternoons.< /review>

I realize how racist this store is with the prices on items purchased by African Americans. The price of a can of Glory Greens being $4.99, when others  are less. So no this was not a good visit</Text>

< Review>
Employees here seem to have their noses stuck in the air as if they're not in a service industry and that means being helpful and nice..lol...the deli is always packed and you actually see employees trying to avoid making eye contact with customers because they don't want to come out to assist them...either many employees are new or they don't give a hoot! At least the produce is always fresh!<//Review>

Safeway drives me crazy. It's the only grocer at which I've ever had price errors, and it's happened several times over the years. I was just telling someone about that today, went to the store this evening, got home and found they once again didn't give me the sale price so I have to go back in the morning and complain.< /Text>

<Review>This is specifically for the deli. I work in the same parking lot of this Safeway and have gone to the deli here regularly on numerous occasions I have had to deal with rude employees or wait for up to 15 minuets to be helped. Today I went in to get a sandwich while on my lunch break and I ordered my sandwich after waiting 10 minuets to be helped I had the woman working behind the counter tell me that it would cost an extra $1 for my order that I regularly order and have never been charged an extra $1 for. I told her ok that’s fine. Then after I asked for a certain bread she looked around and said I don’t have that either. I just left, I am done giving this deli another hand with their rude employee’s who clearly hate their jobs.</Review><Date>1541718930935< /Date>< name>

If you like waiting in line, this is the place for you. Busy times = always. Not uncommon to spend 30 minutes shopping and then 30 trying to get out. They rarely have baggers and don't seem to value speed with their cashiers. Otherwise your normal Safeway: clean, well-stocked, reasonable prices. Just very, very, very, very slow.</Text>

Safeway always have a large variety of items to choose .  Sometimes a bit pricey but always have great sales. The bakery, my favorite,  is the best.  Whenever I need a cake made..Safeway is the place to go to.  Everyone always ask where I got it.<//review>

Had the worst experience with the cashier - ALFRED I just left in tears over carrying my puppy in the store. He started yelling at me and then had someone follow me out of the store and all the way too my car !!! I felt unsafe and humiliated. I live behind the store and and have never had a experience like this before. I am still in shock over the whole experience.< /Text>

An awesome and clean place to shop. They have alot of different varieties when it comes to food. It's best if you shop here when things are on sale because some things will be $1-2 cheaper from the original marked price.<//review>

Everything in this store is overpriced. Even as a member I have to buy 2 or 5 or 10 of everything to get player price. Cant find items with ease. I felt lost, and gouged. I spent $100 & didnt get much for my money. Not a great value</Text>

If you like waiting in line, this is the place for you. Busy times = always. Not uncommon to spend 30 minutes shopping and then 30 trying to get out. They rarely have baggers and don't seem to value speed with their cashiers. Otherwise your normal Safeway: clean, well-stocked, reasonable prices. Just very, very, very, very slow.<//Review>

<Review>This is specifically for the deli. I work in the same parking lot of this Safeway and have gone to the deli here regularly on numerous occasions I have had to deal with rude employees or wait for up to 15 minuets to be helped. Today I went in to get a sandwich while on my lunch break and I ordered my sandwich after waiting 10 minuets to be helped I had the woman working behind the counter tell me that it would cost an extra $1 for my order that I regularly order and have never been charged an extra $1 for. I told her ok that’s fine. Then after I asked for a certain bread she looked around and said I don’t have that either. I just left, I am done giving this deli another hand with their rude employee’s who clearly hate their jobs.< /Review></record>

You will experience a grocery store. Just like every other grocery store. Be kind, the employees have to deal with complete dicks on a daily basis. .....you might have to wait in line, OMG!!. If you don't like it buy groceries online.... Amazon delivers.</review>

Store opens at 5am breakfast sandwich at 6am that's fine but the person that does them isn't there yet AGAIN! Nothing is ready again! What is so hard about putting egg and cheese on a piece of bread and heating it up?</text>

Had to literally wait 50 minutes at pharmacy line to pick up prescription.
Each time i walk in and walk out my clothes catch that fried food smell that lingers at this store.

UpDate: i came to this store after a year , since my last review hoping things might have changed but No its still the same stupid pharmacy with 40-50 minute wait times.</Review>

The store has a horrible lay out in front. With the line for Starbucks, Jamba juice and the deli so close to the door it's hard to maneuver in and out. The cashier lines are always backed up into the aisles which makes shoping and checking out a headache. There are never enough lanes open and there are several checkers that move so slowly I want to ask them to move so I can do it myself.  On the back of the store things are more open and the produce section is well later out.  Most of the staff are friendly and it's close to home so those are pluses.< /Review>

<text>This is is the worst managed Safeway I've been to in my life. They never have enough cashiers that results in generally long check out lines. They never have enough courtesy clerks (baggers), which also is a reason for for the long lines. A few of the checkers are way too casual and laid back, striking up conversations with other checkers when they should be working faster to reduce the length of the lines. This conveys  the message that I am not important despite waiting in a long line. I once waited 20 minutes at the meat counter b/c they didn't have enough help. The deli counter generally has long lines (again, not enough help....do you see a trend here?) The only positive thing is that the prices are generally lower than their nearby grocery store neighbors, the produce is usually fresh, and the store is generally clean. I generally  head to Raley's or Bel Air now. It is worth the higher prices.</text><response>None<//response><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Steven Herrera< /user_name>< time>

<Text>Most times, it's cheaper to shop at Target or Raley's. Raley's has a better selection-their prices are competitive with Safeway (I have only seen a few times where their prices were higher). I have found that their prices are not worth the gas points.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

The customer service at this store has taken a big hit, especially in self check out. It's unfortunate. I hope they get it together. The store is clean and the sales are pretty cool though.<//Review>

Employees at night just stand around and socialize with each other. It is no wonder the prices are high because of the under productive employees.<//text>

<Review>It's clear the management is a problem here. You can tell because of misery the employees are clearly in day to day, they don't even bother trying to hide it. Where there are miserable employees there is usually horrible management. They are rude, slow, understaffed, the customers are an inconvenience to them and if they have to go "above and beyond" their regular job duties do not expect a pleasant experience. The other day I was down the same aisle as the e cart shoppers and they almost ran me down, they were NOT going to move their cart out of the way as they were busily chatting as if they were customers out for a day of shopping. I can honestly say 95% of those employees do not want to be there and it shows. So when you come to Safeway you might as well use the self checkout where you are your own checker and besides it's not like they ever have any baggers anyway!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x809b29e4bbd7614f:0x69365083d64b8282< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

<Review>I love safeway but this location is a joke.  Their deli department could possibly be the worst deli department in any grocery store I've ever walked into.  They are always out of stuff no matter the time or day you go, they always take forever to make anything from a wrao, to a sandwich and the staff is extremely rude.  I only go here because I work across the street but damn this location sucks.< /Review>< pictures>

Do not go shopping here anywhere near 5 or 6 pm.  Only one normal register open (for alcohol or more than 15 items) and one express lane.   The lines were wrapped around the registers and down the aisles.</Text>

I went to the Jamba Juice located by Starbucks and got two drinks. There was a girl working alone and her name is Monserrat. I got both my drinks and I was almost done drinking mine but when I drank half of it I realized a piece of her hair was in my drink. EW. Safeway needs to make employees working with long hair around food or drinks wear hair nets or make them put it into a bun because I don't enjoy paying 5 bucks for a smoothie with someone's hair in it! Ick! Unacceptable 😡😡😡😡<//text>

Produce is okay if you will be using it within the next couple days. Not especially cheap but open until midnight making it convenient for last minute shopping.</Review>

I really like all of the staff members especially reeza, julianna, and galany, but there's a girl named alyssa at self checkout who is VERY rude and crass... everytime i go in she seems pissed off about whatever but she needs to leave that at the door because it's very unprofessional...< /review>

<Name>Virtual PM</Name><Review>This is the worst run Safeway in the Sacramento area. Always a long wait to check out and always double check the experation dates on the items you buy. My wife and I have had multiple times bringing items home and seeing the experation dates had expired a week to a month ago.< /Review><userid>105921008521572932959<//userid>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Terrible!! Alyssa in the floral department is so unprofessional. I wanted to purchase some flowers & I waited at the counter while she sat there & gossiped with another employee while on the clock. She noticed me standing there & continued to ignore me for about 10 minutes. Right when I was about to file a complaint with management she walked over & greeted me with a bad attitude. Bottom line is I will never purchase flowers from here again. I guess I would be mad too if I looked like a fat ogre. Princess Fiona needs some extreme training on how to be a professional & stop gossiping while paying consumers are waiting. Shame on you Safeway.</review>< Pics>
