<text>This is the best NY deli in the area. Their corned beef, pastrami and Matzo Ball soup are all delicious.
They make many of their bakery items in house!

A small but true New York style Jewish Delicatessen in Orange County. A must for those with East Coast roots or others wanting to sample a true deli- not just a sandwich shop... Enjoy!</review>

Best kosher deli in South Orange County. Probably for all of Orange County but to be honest, I haven't searched very hard above the 55 freeway. The owner and head operator Marilyn will either serve you a 5-star sandwich or she won't serve it. Really really good pastrami.< /review>

The people here are really nice and their bread is very good, their french rolls and baguettes very crunchy and authentic. I ordered a lunch meal which came with a drink and side, pasta salad. The sandwhich was big enough to share so I saved half of it. I would go back for sure. The pastries look phenomenal and I want to try their other subs.<//text>

NOT ACTUALLY KOSHER!

Excellent food, as made clear by all the reviews, but as an ORTHODOX jew, we require a Mashgiach on premises in order to qualify as Kosher. Just because you use Kosher products doesn't mean you're Kosher according to the standard that ORTHODOX Jews hold by.

If you're not orthodox, I highly recommend this place based on all the other amazing reviews!<//Text>

Great food, like being at Katz's deli in NYC, but better. Everything is made there. Matzo balls as light as feathers. Great humos, best corned beef. A must stop in if in the mood for Good food. The owner is a delight as well.< /Text>

<Response>{'time': 1508894222797, 'text': 'I am sorry that you did not receive quality service that is deserved of all customers. The only time a single sheet of foil should be offered is for wrapping a portion of a sandwich, and only because it keeps the sandwich moist, as opposed to a box. which is not as airtight. And, of course, a bag to carry it out should be offered. Never should a customer leave upset.\nPlease remind us of this incident and we will make sure you get the attentive service that was lacking today. I do apologize.'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I'm giving 4 stars because Pizza was good, but I order a Cesar salad and Cesar salad does not goes with spinach ... so Basically their Cesar salad had, Spinach, croutons, a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and "cesar dressing" for $7 hmmm.</review>

This place was so unsanitary. Due to COVID everyone should be wearing a mask but I guess these workers made an exception? Also I seen one of the workers eat a piece of cheese bread while handling my food in the back . I can honestly Say little Cesars is better than this place . They were practically spitting in my food while talking to each other .<//text>

Ordered 3 pizzas...one pepperoni, one pepperoni and green pepper and one veggie. Veg had green pepper, black olives and mushrooms ( not very veggie). Average pizza at best but the shocker was the just under $80 price tag. Won't be eating pizza here again, but I will say the service and friendly dude running the place was the bright side. Just not $80 worth.<//review>

This place was convenient seeing how there weren't any other pizza shops close by. The flavor was average, there was too much dough , and it was rather expensive.  The cheese pizza was the best.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) If more is charged to the credit card for a takeaway than was originally confirmed at the checkout, one feels robbed. Our mistake: We pressed the button "no receipt" on email or mobile phone. With a tip of 37%, the saleswoman served herself very well on $ 54!

(Original)
Wenn bei einem Takeaway der Kreditkarte mehr belastet wird, als ursprünglich an der Kasse bestätigt, fühlt man sich bestohlen. Unser Fehler: Wir drückten den Button "kein Beleg" auf Email oder Natel. Mit 37 % Trinkgeld hat sich die Verkäuferin auf 54 $ sehr gut bedient!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Guy, Craig, and the Crew are a no-hassle, precise and affordable service group of mechanics in the Palm Desert area. The monetary savings is considerably better than the dealerships, on the order of 25-50% savings.

Thank you for your unwavering commitment to auto health!</review>< Date>

<Text>I was very impressed how the Technician Carl took care of us, every concern we had with our car was checked out, a call was made by Carl to explain our concerns and costs.  We had everything done that could have been a safety issue, also Carl's recommendations.   Both my husband and I were pleased with the work and how the car was repaired in a timely manner.  Cam Stone's is now our Automotive experts.   Thanks to the team, job well done.

<Time>1593100637625< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Cam stone's Automotive is excellent on value, good quality NAPA parts reasonable labor, and of course everyone their is friendly and   professional. I say this as we woman usually get taken advantage of at these type of auto shops. At other auto shops they have a tendency to think cheeks don't know anything about cars. Going in for a simply oil/filter change turns out to be so much more than you really needed steeling your money. Then to find out when you get home that they charged you for something I didn't need for my car. This has happened to me from other auto shops. But not at Cam Stone's Automotive's. That's why I like taking all of my cars to them. Its nice to be respected as you pay for what your car actually needs and not a penny more. I just love it here! What I am saying here is honest and true. If you don't think so then...Go check it out for yourself! I dare you too.  Ms. Green< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I had to wait a little longer than usual because of the COVID 19,
but the service was excellent as usual.
I trust their recommendation and suggestions, as they don't
try to sell you something you don't need.
I highly recommend Cam Stones to everyone.<//Text>< Response>

We recently relocated in the desert after 30 years in the Florida Keys. Unfamiliar with local auto service options and disappointed with a first dealer service experience I googled and found Cam Stone Automotive. The reviews were excellent and mirrored those of my Key West mechanic: personalized attention to each and every client, technical expertise, friendly and prompt communication and fair and reasonable cost. Guy and Carl man the desk with a cheerful camaraderie and personally supervise an excellent crew of licensed mechanics.
We thank them for making our western transition even more comfortable. Sid< /text>

We just moved to the area and on the recommendation of some friends used Cam Stone’s to take care of a relatively small problem our car was having.  They were very friendly and certainly got the job done in a timely manner.  We will certainly be using them to service our cars.< /Review>

<text>As a woman, I never know what the heck a mechanic is talking about.  At Camstone, I always know I'm taken care of and only sold what is NEEDED. Guy and his crew are really great! They are honest and do a great job! I'm thankful to be able to have a mechanic I know and can trust. Just recently I took my car in for whatever the light was on for (I think it was for one of the big services) of course I was thinking it was going to be super expensive, and Guy said you need a few things,  but the others can wait, you don't need them yet. I appreciate not being upsold for things I don't need.  Thank you Camstone for taking care of all my car needs! You have earned my business for life.< /text>< Date>

Their quote was accurate and the work completed quickly (I was lucky that they had the part in stock). No hidden fees or extra costs. They even took the time to explain what was done and show me the part they replaced when I asked. Work was completed and vehicle was ready the very next day.

<Review>I've dealt with Cam Stone's for over 20 years and get 1st rate service. They keep a clean shop and they treat each customer like a person likes to be treated when you get that bad news about your car, or the good news. They are professional and timely. I take the company fleet trucks there and get us in and out. They are not cheap but they are very competitive when it comes to price, so that means they are fair. The mechanics seem well trained and they do smog checks. I would suggest them to anyone as an alternative to taking your vehicle to the dealership.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate><UserId.>118215396946002002689< /UserId.>< Date>

<review>I have trusted Cams stones for over 20 years. When I needed someone fair, reliable and trustworthy. I remember the first time I needed a mechanic I was young working 2 jobs  and didn't have a lot of money. I called around for quotes and when I found Cam stones the guy on the line gave me peace of mind that he could hemp. He offered me a great quote with towing Included. I was so happy and relieved. They were honest an never have tried to sale me any thing extra. Over the years now married my husband and I have continued to go with them.  Recently when my daughter was in a bind we took the car to their shop, I just have  peace of mind that they are going to be honest and not take advantage of us.  Thank you Cam.Stones for your service!!</review><name>leticia lewis<//name>< GmapID>

I 100% Recommend this Mechanic. We were vacationing from out of town, and our car wouldn't start. We took it here, they figured it out, and our car was fixed the same day, so we were still able to enjoy the rest of our day. Plus, they gave us a ride back to our hotel and came to pick us up when our car was ready.< /Text>

<username>L S<//username><Date>1490935773022<//Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>Our rental car overheated and they looked at car for free. They reconnected hoses, added water and determined the problem. When the rental car couldn't get to us on time for us to make our flight, they offered to shuttle us to the car rental for free. They were busy, but still took time to help some "out of town people" in a bind.

They are in the business to help others:)

We would add more stars if we could. And would love it if they were in our town.< /Text>< Pictures>

My truck broke down days before the Thanksgiving holiday and Ace was very busy. They took my truck in after being towed there and told me they wouldn’t get to look at it until the following Monday. Which was totally understandable. Mike gave me the list of repairs and for a reasonable price too. They would leave me updates on the status of the Truck and when all said was done. My truck came out running great and back on the road.  Thank you Ace Automotive for the great service and special shout out to Amanda for her customer service.<//review>

We have a 16’ Box truck for our business and I use ACE for oil changes.  They are always great to work with, they do a great job and at a reasonable price.  My last visit I asked them to take a look at the loading ramp on the truck as one of the welds was broken.  I was afraid I would have to take it a specialty shop but Mike fixed it that day.  Awesome shop!<//review>

<review>They are very honest and reliable and very skilled at what they do. They were up front about what  my costs would be and they stayed as close as they could to that price. This car was older and needed a lot of work, but they told me that it was worth it. That the engine was still strong. So we sank a good chunk of change and a year and a half later that car is still running strong, with high mileage. I trust them totally! In fact bringing my Jeep in for some work as soon as I make an appointment.
1/15/19 Update: Just got home after taking my Jeep in for a heater core repair. They did another fantastic job and at such a reasonable price! I have a long drive home up the mountain ( and in this cold rainy weather) and my car is happy again, no leaky coolant, no fogged up windows anymore! My ride home was warm dry and I could see again! lol I am so thankful we have such skilled and honest people to rely on in our town! Thank you, ACE Automotive! You have a life long customer here.</review><resp>None< /resp>< Rate>

The folks at Ace Automotive were great. They were able to squeeze me in their schedule and make the repairs in less than 2 days from calling them. Much appreciate a local family business with deep community ties that pays tribute first responders. Check out the pictures in the office and mural on the back of the building.< /Text>

Came in for a simple lube oil and filter. Counter associates were helpful in getting me comfortable and acclimated with the services my vehicle was gonna be receiving. Technicians were very fast and thorough with the whole process and informed me at the time and via text with an entire document of services performed and future services that would be required to keep my car in top shape. Thank you Ace Automotive and Truck Repair.</review>

Used to change the oil here in my moms car and my son's car. But now I go to AJ's Auto Shop, still on Soscol but down between the Nissan and Ford dealerships. Better service, great employees and owner. And they look out for other problems you could have with your vehicle. The inspection report they send you after work is done shows you pictures of what is wrong or what could go wrong with your vehicle. Absolutely love that shop!!<//review>

Excellent experience with this family owned repair shop. They have been in business for over twenty years and have gained a tremendous reputation with the Napa community. Individuals and businesses alike.
No wonder why, they are straight shooters. Honest people with an ethic rarely found in the auto repair business. During my most recent visit, I was again impressed by how quickly and throughly they assessed the issue with my car, told me exactly what needed to be replaced, repaired, and a quote that reasonable. My car was ready to pick up far ahead of my expectations and I am ecstatic over the quality of work. These are great people to have on your side when your vehicle needs help. Thanks to Mike and his incredible team!</review>

I am happy to be able to find an honest automotive repair shop like Ace Automotive! I had a check engine light on my 2006 Charger and went to Ace. Glad to have meet Bernie, Mike, and everyone at the shop are great honest people. They gave me a price and charged me what they said they would. There was no surprise of "other fees" when I picked up my car. I now bring all my cars, truck, and RV to Ace for any mechanical issues and oil changes as well.  I highly recommend you call Ace Automotive before you go to any other auto place.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Mike and his team are true professionals. My work truck was having some issues so I took it to him immediately. He went through the steps to properly diagnose the issue which ended up being my transmission. He worked with my extended warranty company and took care of all the paperwork. It was a process and took about two and half weeks to process paperwork and gather material upon approval from the warranty company, but I didn’t have to do anything other than say yes for the approval. He had put the new transmission in ASAP and now I’m up and running again. I will be using his services in the future and I  highly recommend him and his team.

I was referred to Ace from Kevin at B & G Tires last fall.  My husband had already used their services for his truck.  They are courteous and friendly over the phone and upon entering the shop, a comfortable assurance that made me feel welcome and my car was in good hands.  These are  very important qualities in a business that can be very intimidating for those of us that do not know anything about mechanics for our vehicles.  Ace will now be my go to repair shop for all my future vehicle repairs.  I so appreciate their friendly and confident atmosphere in their shop and personnel.  Thanks for making me feel welcome.

I recommend Ace Automotive & Truck Repair wholeheartedly.  Mike is honest, caring and has always taken great care of my cars.  It is hard to find a mechanic that you can totally trust to do the right thing, and to ONLY do  the work that really needs to be done for your car to run well, be safe, and be  reliable.  Ace is the kind of place you can take your vehicle to, and know you and your car will be well taken care of.<//Text>

My family and I had driven to Napa Valley from LA for a few days of wine tasting. My wife and I had planned to fly home while my 2 daughters would drive my 2008 Volvo XC90 with 160K miles back to LA on the scenic route 1. But 2 days into our visit the Volvo started running very rough and I knew it wouldn’t make it safely down the coast. Our Airbnb host recommended ACE Auto but it was Sunday and all shops were closed. What’s more, ACE was completely booked up for several days. But early Monday morning I drove to ACE, introduced myself to Mike, and asked him to help me. He didn’t have to. But he did. Within a few hours, he had my car running like a charm and my daughters were able to safely drive it home. Mike and his team, including Amanda in the office, couldn’t have been nicer or more professional.</review>< Pics>

so far....none at all.  Will always recommend Mike and the team

Great service and a very understanding shop. Thanks for everything! I had my oil changed and brake rotors and pads replaced.The work was done quickly and I was notified by text when finished, which is really convenient, my truck brakes smooth and I’m very happy.</review>

ACE has earned my trust with its quick, competent, and very reasonably priced service. They are my go-to resource for our two cars and recently gave us a thorough evaluation of a new vehicle we'd bought. Mike and his team are candid, friendly, and "full-disclosure" so we can avoid surprises, plus there's no up-selling pressure. I couldn't ask for more.< /Review>

Great guys, prices are good. I want to give them five stars....but I have to be honest or I wouldn't be doing this. First, they messed with my lights inside my car which made it so my exterior lights stayed on when I got out of the car, no biggie luckily I caught when I got home so the battery didn't go dead. Secondly, they left my hood unlatched! Not cool! If I would have hit the highway I may have had a serious incident. Luckily a gentleman on the road flagged me down and told me the hood was not latched. I always preach...attention to details wins the biz for me. Otherwise, great guys and won't make you do work that's unnecessary or overcharge you for labor etc.< /Text>

<text>First off, you can trust these guys with your daughter, let alone your car. They're straight shooters that will tell you how it is. I'd been going to Ace for a few years and my 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante took a turn for the worse. After about 3 times in the shop in 4 months, Mike told me straight - it was time to get a new car. He delivered the bad news with bedside manner of a St. Judes Childrens Hospital doctor.

Prior to that I was having all sorts of bad luck, Mitsubishi had discontinued several parts that I needed to get my car fixed. This was over the course of at least 3 visits to Mike and the guys at Ace worked their magic. One time they actually made a part in the shop and another time they had a friend machine the part to install, actually making the part less expensive than if it hadn't been discontinued.

Sometimes your car is not in the best shape and you need to make an exit plan. For the past year and a half, my talks with Mike had been focused on this plan. What every car owner needs is a good relationship with their mechanic. You're not going to pull your kid out of school and throw them in a new place for a better deal. Same thing here.

Mike and the guys knew my car and knew its history. With Ace having a better relationship with me and my car, I am supremely confident we got everything we could out of it.

Before getting my new car, I brought it in to the shop for them to check it out. And now after buying it, I'm feeling a lot more confident that I've made a good decision.

Thanks Ace!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Long wait at the drive through. Food was good but I gave you 3 stars because I got none of the sauces I asked for ( it's happened before). We were asked to park in front because our food took long to be made, so another wait time for that. Understaffed maybe?</text>

<Text>They say open until 2am, but they were not even open until midnight! They had two chairs and a tape blocking off the drive through, while they sat inside. We parked to see if they were open for dine in, but could see the chairs stacked and blocking  the door. I made eye contact with two employees but they turned away.< /Text>< date>

Very clean location with quick and friendly service! Food was customized as requested and the staff made sure we had all of the napkins, utensils, and sauces we needed for the order. Highly recommend this location for a quick breakfast or lunch on a budget!</text>

This is why it is important to check your order before you leave. Its ok to take everything out of the box and make sure they dont put cheese on your burger when you DID order it without. No one to blame but myself for putting trust in a fast food employee.< /Review>

Depending on who's cooking, also depends on whether you'll get what the menu says you'll get in your meal. For instance, I usually order a scrambler combo...sometimes I'll get bacon, and ham in the eggs (which it shows on menu picture), and sometimes just ham. Also, sometimes you'll get the bell peppers in your potatoes (also pictured), and sometimes not. All depends on who's cooking, and what they feel like adding, or not adding.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

They get my order wrong everytime or short me a major food item like a cheeseburger. When confronted at the drive in window, they become defensive, argumentative, and disrespectful. I love JIB, but their employees are Monsters.<//Review>

<review>It took 7 minutes in the drive thru for the guy to take my order. He was then very rude about questions regarding not even acknowledging we were there.  Just said "yeah we're busy".  Food was ok but then it was only curly fries and tacos. Pretty hard to screw them up.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<text>Honestly I received very poor quality food . When I got home I sat down with my family to eat and our food was as if they had it up past the holding time . Our burgers basically seem old not fresh . We also paid extra for larger sodas and when we tasted them they were watery as if they were poured along time ago . Tacos looked old and dry . Very poor quality . Especially being that I’ve worked as a manager in the food industry. Quality is everything even if you make the customer wait .<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmap_id>

<review>Thanks to David and Sabrina for having the time in grooming our two paw members of the family to start a new year with a fresh groom care. I was visiting town and it was difficult to get a same day appointment. Luckily, found this gem place who took our request. Sabrina was such a sweet girl and already learning the family business at an early age. Very professional and courteous. surely our paw members were in great hands.</review>< Pictures>

I have a 4 yr old pit bull that I hike and jog with but her nails have gotten too long so I haven't been able to take her out as I'd like. Of course, that breaks her heart to be left home (and mine) so I called my local dog groom shop for a nail trim.
Unfortunately they were full in appt space for nail trimming but offered the pit bull special package (shampoo, conditioner,  massage) for the weekend. I figured, why not? Inexpensive and she could use some grooming.
Dropped her off on the next available same day appt time..less than an hour later My  furbaby came out smelling so fresh and feeling so soft.  Bonus- they filed her nails perfectly 😊
Now my run dog and I can get back to hiking or hitting the pavement again without me worrying about her damaging her nails or her hurting herself ..and she smells great 👍
Sofia and I thank you!! We'll def be back!</review>

I called and asked a few questions & they set me up for same day appointment for three dogs. It was my 1st time and my dogs came out looking happy, clean, and smelling soooo good. Good people & good humor with David. I will be back because it’s too cold this time of year to bathe dogs outside. Check them out people.<//text>

<review>I have been taking my furbaby here for about six years. The service and prices are great. I know I've done a review before but I just have to say again how amazing this place is!!! Today I had a situation with my baby  and she was under stress because of it..They told me to come right in and they fixed her up. I LOVE THEM ALL AT THIS SHOP! They really care about your babies. It's not just about money to them. This is a family owned business and they treat you like family. If you take your babies to another groomer I would switch to this place. There is no better groomers out there.<//review>< time>

They used to, hope they still do, take dog food donations that they give to dog shelters. They even helped me one time. They are very caring. You will never have to worry about taking your furbabies to them.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I would recommend this place to anyone with a dog who needs grooming; from nail trims to shampoos to hair cuts. They even do teeth cleaning, and all for the lowest prices in town. I'm always sure to give a few extra dollars to whoever works on my dog because I appreciate the great service at such a low price!</Text></record>

BEWARE! I took my dog there because no one else had any openings for 3 weeks. I should have known when 'Doggie Style' had a selection of times available for the very next day! I was very specific in what I wanted and needed done. When I picked her up she looked nice but I basically paid for a wash and comb out. When I was dissatisfied the owners husband was pissed and took my dog to the table and closed the door. I could see how rough he was being with her and wanted to break through the glass and treat him accordingly! He chopped her hair and cut her gorgeous eyelashes which was one of the specifications NOT TO DO!! She had an uneven cocker spaniel cut?! I couldn't wait to get out of there!
When I called to talk to the owner I found out that it was her husband that had been the one that was so rude and unprofessional! Later the daughter (the talented groomer) called me and proceeded to defend her father's actions. Seriously? Do you think this is the first time I've ever had my dog at the groomers?! Maybe the first time I've EVER had such a disdain for a groomer before! So to put it mildly: "Don't take your dog there unless you're guaranteed that the daughter will do the work!"<//text>

< Review>
I'm remaining anonymous. This place is just amazing, but for the past visits for my pet, he's been coming back home with fleas. He never had a flea problem, and it spread to my cat and now home.
I really like this place but they have a serious flea problem. a relative took their pet and now they had to bomb their home to get rid of them.
Im sure many of you love their pets and I'm not tying to run these people out of business but this had to be said for a public warning,< /Review>

I took him in for an all over bath, brush and everything in between. I also opted for a flea dip because I was worried that he might have some, even though he has many organic treatments- I lived in a flea infested area and took him in as I moved out.

I came to pick him up and they said no fleas- no charge, first visit - discount.
They genuinely care about pets and aren't gonna take money because they can.

Owner wasn't the friendliest guy and they shaved my dogs face a little too closely so she had a rash. But they give a discount for first timers. It is what I would've expected from the name.</review>

<text>I went to them years ago when they were in North highlands, I was under the impression they had sold their business to new owners at this new location and I was happy to see when I picked up my little guy the owner was still in business.

The guy who owns the place is really phenomenonall with the animals. He's a true dog whisper and a lover of pit bulls. They do such a great job with all types of dogs and temperament, I would highly recomend Doggie stylez.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x809ad8ec78bb6363:0xd635f2dc42ebbc0< /gmap_id>< UserId.>

I love this place. Always happy, courteous, and helpful. They’ve helped me quit smoking cigarettes. Plus they have the coolest guard dog ever! Nothing but good vibes!<//text>

<Review>Good selection of juice, store is very well organized and very clean, customer service is great. Priced competitively with other local shops, have way more options for juice and replacement pods and starter kits. Only disadvantage is its priced a little higher then online but you can trust its a legit product, can get it day of, and the rewards program they have helps make it worth shopping locally. Most definitely recommend them; its unfortunate I haven't stopped in before today.< /Review>< user>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I use to go to a place within 10 minutes walking distance from my house and one day they didn’t have what I needed so I went to  hygeia vape. That was it the first time that I went there was all I needed to know that this was my new place! The lady that works there is awesome!!  So polite and the products are amazing. So many options! This is why I drive about 25 minutes away to get what I need now! Not to mention her beautiful baby zima! Where else can you go and get great customer service and be able to love on a precious doggy at the same time!!

<pics>None< /pics><review>Good customer service. But, their pricing is too high. They run Regular weekend sales however the in-store prices are set in a way that the discount you get for the sale basically just brings you to regular retail price of their competitors or MSRP. They are fake sales basically. I don’t like those type of business practices.< /review><user>118251624073368305301< /user>< date>

{'time': 1597093221513, 'text': 'I am sorry for your experience with Puff, we at Hygeia buy Puff direct from the owner of puff,  and we pay pretty high price for it .\nMost importantly is we understand that these devices are made in China and no one can grant them therefore we exchange defective ones right away and sometimes we get refunds from vendors and sometimes we don’t , yet we put our customer services first and take the loss . We get 1 defected out of 30-40 (3-4 boxes )\nMakes you wonder why would u go back if you experienced that.\nYou must have us confused with the other shop down the street, or you are the competition .Both ways we are sorry for your Puff experience and invite you to visit our shop.'}</response>

I've been going to Hygeia shop for years and I love it! Wonder service, great atmosphere, and they always have what I need. It's easy to find and has great prices! I've recommended Hygeia to multiple friends and family members and it's now their spot to shop also! Do yourself a favor and check them out!<//review>

<Text>About a year ago I quit smoking after I went to this shop every time I go to the store I leave in a happier mood than I went in with. The owner always  Is very welcoming and is very patient with all of my questions and has the knowledge to answer each question or concern.
Over the past few years, I've tried to quit smoking cigarettes several times but it was very difficult when my husband and coworkers were still smoking. About 1 year ago my brother came home from work after a year and a half of traveling the country. The first few months he was home he would not shut up about this smoke shop and how great the owners were and  I had to go in there to stop smoking!< /Text>< response>

Really good shop for disposables and fully stocked for all other varieties of vape and CBD.  Clean and Covid-19 aware so bring your mask and be ready for the social distancing rules.. these girls are strict but great for health and safety.  I wish they were open 24/7 24hrs a day... staff knowledge is unprecedented and i felt like i see the doctor more than a shop..< /text>

Excellent customer service, and warm welcoming atmosphere. I have always found what I need of from glass to blast equipment at Hygeia. Recently purchased a lot of silicone for all this sticky icky goodness. The shop is always well stocked, and they even stock specific items if you ask nicely. Thank you Hygeia Vape!< /review>

I had never been to this place before. Sam the manager was really cool. My vape battery wasn't charging so I brought it in here and she checked for me that it was my charger not my battery so I ended up not having to pay for a new battery just a new charger. Most places will just try to sell you a new one.

Awesome customer service, she was very knowledgeable I will be back for my vape needs!< /Text>

<text>Way over priced on there vape juice  and never have any good flavor in stock .<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1572851207226, 'text': 'Thank you for your comment. We have a huge selection of Vape juice “ vape bar” nevertheless manufacturers are aware of the new FDA and flavoring ban, therefor they are producing less or no quantities to lot of them. some of them left the market already. I am sure you didnt know this because we are trying to manage buying flavors from different vendors that has STILL some inventory.  As for the pricing we are cheaper than all shops in Southbay. Please make sure you have the name of the shop correctly since there are few other shops around. Thank you'}< /Resp>

Awesome vape shop. The first two things to greet you are the friendly staff and the friendly giant Rottweiler! The dog is an absolute sweetheart that just wants to be petted. The staff was extremely helpful, answering all my questions with a smile. They have a large variety of almost anything you’d want and need.<//review>

<review>I've been coming here for years. By far this is my favorite vape shop. Their Lomita location has a really big selection of glass separate from the rest of the store. As well as a wall dedicated just to Juices. My favorite part is the owner's Rottweiler, Seema, that"s always there the greet you with a smile.< /review><time>1547778011926<//time><response>{'time': 1575580871829, 'text': 'Thank you for your review! it means a lot to have such loyal customers.'}<//response>< rating>

First I want to mention that the staffs are super chill. Then they're glass merchandise are pretty solid  ( quality-wise ) as-well there  Vape juice.But  semi expensise. Yet it's only understandable cuz you know they do have to make a profit. Unless you want to drive all the way to Downtown LA to get the best quialty glass for the best price.This is the place that you would wanna go that is local around (Lomita) as well you do have to pay the extra bucks :(. if you try negotiating/bargain  with the store owner for ur dream glass, and you got the cash. Then hey doesn't hurt to try. Yeah I'm a very picky. So when I find the one it's the one 🙄🕵️. #loveyou<//text>

The owner doesn’t really work at the store and been out of the country for a while. It’s a vape and smoke shop with 2-4 employees! We all have vapes and we all love making sales, that’s how we pay our bills. It is sad that this is the unkindness level that the competition has reached.'}<//Resp>

I absolutely love this place, the sisters who run it are amazing people. They always have the best prices and are a couple of the friendliest people I've ever met, always willing to answer any questions a person might have and they gave me a great deal on one of those new Wismec's.</Review>

Checked on Google for CBD oil called the lady suggested I pass by to try it. I was surprised by the selection and the opportunity to try before I bought it. Not many places give me an excited feeling of wanting to return but this shop did 4 sure. Check it out</review>

I'very been on the forefront of the vape scene and this shop and wonderful people are right there to help and support their customers as family.
They even went above and beyond for me when I got a fixed gear track bike, about $10,000 bike, stolen from in fronthe of the cell phone shop next door, Tale the owner, she was all over it! She got my bike back the very next morning.

Anyone who vapes, or smokes MMJ or tobacco in the south bay, come COME to Hygeia Vape & Smoke shop, and I promise you'll never go anywhere else again!

Best juices I've ever vaped, wonderful people, and  the best glass all for AMAZING prices!

With much love to Tale, and  everyone at Hygeia;

<text>Sweetest Juices and Staff!!!!!!
Awesome little smoke shop with the best staff!! Hidden next to the 7/11 on PCH. Tala is so sweet and knowledgeable on products!! She got me and awesome white mod that I love.. Won't go back to what I was smoking before and introduced me to the most delicious juices called Potion Liquids, I got their flesh colored peach and it's amazing! Plus the Potion e-juice has CBD which I never knew about but is very relaxing and I'm enjoying it. Thanks Tala and Sevem for the awesome service and pretty faces to go along with it!!

They have a huge selection of juices and mods. The juices are all delicious and Tala sure knows how to pick the best ones!! I got a new juice today called pebbles donuts and Honey Bear..... Amazing and delicious!! Tala and Sevem are the best, always the sweetest.

Ps. They have $5 smokes as well.<//text>< Pictures>

<date>1626286597768<//date><review>I've had back and neck tension most of my life, unable to sit still comfortably and just assumed it was just how it would be. I would go to chiropractic treatment roughly once a month to alleviate it some, but when I came to Mansour Chiropractic (my previous chiropractor moved away) I was actually given a treatment plan with an approximate end date that I should feel better by.

The approach is very different in my experience, having range of motion testing and x-rays after so many months of treatment to monitor progress. So far I feel a lot better and the staff have all been wonderful.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is fantastic! My only regret is that I didn't start chiropractic care sooner. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. My favorite part is that I never have to wait to see my doctor once I arrive. I'm a very punctual person and one of my least favorite things about visiting a doctor's office is when you have to wait forever and that doesn't happen here. I'm in and out within 20 minutes which is great! I've also noticed some significant improvements in my health and physical abilities in just 6 weeks of treatment. I highly recommend Mansour Chiropractic!<//Review><user>116091972235727143101< /user><pics>None< /pics>< username>

It took my mom and I forever to find a good chiropractor in our city. My mom needs adjustment for her neck and me for my lower back and we have been going to a place in Long Beach and have been bouncing between facilities because our conditions never seemed to progressively improve. Finally finding a trustworthy place in Chino Hills has been amazing. All three doctors are super great, super friendly, professional, and helpful. They truly care about you and your well being and put all their effort into organizing a goal for your well-being and a better and healthier future. I have recommended Mansour Chiropractic to almost all of my family and friends. Highly recommend, they will take the greatest care of you. Thank you for everything, Mansour Chiropractic! My mom and I's condition has significantly improved since we started coming here in March.<//text>

<Text>From the first meetings to the initial follow-ups with the Doctor and his wonderful staff, I knew I was in the right place for my spine health needs.  An evidence-based approach with the doctor reviewing my specific problem areas and the treatments which have addressed these initial quality-of-life aches and pains have shown me that I've made the right decision in my choice of doctors.  I recommend Mansour to friends whenever the topic comes up.  I feel fortunate that I live so close, yet I meet fellow clients who travel from the bottom of the OC to Palmdale and beyond to get their treatment.  There's a reason for that.  Excellent care and service.<//Text>< rating>

I have been seeing Dr Mansur for a little more than a month.  I went to see him because I didn't have a good experience with another chiropractor. One thing I liked, was that he took X-rays and did other tests to determine the root cause. And after that recommend the treatment.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating when I need to make changes to my appointments. I would recommend Dr Mansur to anyone who is looking for a great chiropractic.< /Review>

Mansour Chiropractic is the best hands down. My back and neck has never felt this good in a number of years. I no longer suffer from frequent back and neck aches daily. I am pleased with the outcome in such a short amount of time. Everyone in the clinic is friendly and professional. They truly care  and want the best for their patients.<//text>

About a month ago was the first time that i started receiving chiropractic care. I wanted to be able to fix my back problems with out surgery, and we have been doing just that. Dr. Monsour and his team have gone above and beyond in taking care of me. The facility is clean and very welcoming. Highly recommend them to anyone seeking chiropractic care.<//Review>

***This may be long but PLEASE READ if you are considering visiting Monsour Chiropractic. I hope this review helps inform anyone who is curious or looking for a new Chiropractor. I mean guys... almost 250 reviews and still a 5 star rating. That doesnt happen by accident.

Monsour Chiropractic is truly one of a kind. I feel very lucky to have found Dr. Monsour and his entire office staff and Doctors. I injured lower my back last month on a Sunday and started looking for a Chiropractor. I havent been to one for about 20 years. Monsour Chiropractic was not the first office I called but it was the first one I actually visited.

The first person I spoke to when I arrive was Vanessa. Now if theres an example of a wonderful Office Manager, Vanessa would be it. From the moment I walked in she truly makes you feel like you've been going there for years. I've never walked into the office without a warm welcome and "Goodmorning Javier". When a business calls you by name everytime you are in there it really does feel nice.

We started with a consultation with x-rays. Dr. Ellis and Dr. Kevin did the consultation with me and they were great. They are just so informative and detailed in explaining everything they are doing. Even more enjoyable is their passion and desire to not only help your recovery but just make you feel comfortable and relaxed. Now these two Gentlemen both greet just about every client by name whether they are taking care of them or just passing by. TRUE PROFESSIONALS.

Then I had an appt to see Dr. Monsour the next day. I happened to bring my mother because she had to drive me my back was so sore. I mentioned this because of how he treated my mom. He invited her in so she wouldn't be waiting outside and spoke with her with a level of professionalism and compassion that you see in the best of the best of any provider in any practice. Our second half of the consultation with Dr. Monsour consisted of a crash course on everything you should know about your injury and our options for recovery that really felt tailored to ME as a patient and my injury. I decided then and there this is who I want to recover with. Now I'm only a month in my road to recovery and usually wait to post a review until the end but I leave the office everytime feeling that Monsour Chiropractic and this community (really anyone will to drive for great care) should know what kind of practice they are running. Now I know one month isnt going to heal a back that's been in sports, military and manual labor all its life. I do feel confident that my experience here will only get better. Even though a pretty painful injury is why I come here 3 times a week, its truly a joy for the 30 minutes or so I spend here. A TRUE PROFESSIONAL and enjoyable office that makes you feel like you've been here for years.</Text>

<Text>Where do I even begin. I am astonished at not only the progress I've made, so much more flexibility, better posture and virtually no back pain! I am 56 years old (a very active and young 56) and I came in w severe neck and lower back pain due to a car accident, i believe, from years and years ago. My range of motion felt like that of an 80 yr old. I am way too young to be dealing with this let alone settle for it! Dr. Kevin has done such an amazing job adjusting me. Being on this regimented plan was the best money I've spent investing in myself and my health. They are extremely professional, knowledgeable and its a very warm family feel when I am here. I highly highly recommend them. I just moved out of town and travel all over N and S Calif.I will continue to come in for visits and would never consider going to ANYWHERE else. You will not be sorry!<//Text><GmapID>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b<//GmapID>< user_id>

I started visiting Mansour Chiropractic in July 2020 for tinnitus. I also had tension in my shoulders and neck but figured it was a hazard of desk work. It was quickly determined that the tinnitus was caused by a pinched nerve in my neck. Within a week the tinnitus had subsided! It was amazing! My range of motion has steadily increased and I feel better than I have in years! All of the staff is incredibly warm and welcoming, they addressed all of my concerns and have been absolutely wonderful! I highly recommend Mansour Chiropractic!<//text>

Mansour Chiropractic is amazing! The chiropractors here take their time to understand their client’s pain, discomfort and concerns with what they are currently experiencing that decreases their quality of life. Dr. Kevin and Albert Mansour have been very supportive and comforting with their treatment! The staff here is also great as they make sure clients are relaxed, making it feel like home. 10/10 highly recommend!!!</review>

<review>I started seeing Dr. Mansour about 3 months ago for back and neck injury. I was very nervous about chiropractor treatment as I can't even crack my own knuckle without cringing. He spent ample amount of time going over my consultation, took detailed x-rays and range of motion exams to determine the extent of injury and explained the treatment very well and set realistic goals which could be compared against baseline marks. He offered alternate adjustment techniques since I was nervous, however, after first adjustment all the fear was gone and I began to feel immediate tension relief. Customer service is awesome. They definitely make you feel like part of the family. You are never left waiting for your appointment, and they are super flexible with your schedule. My neck and back are on their way to full recovery and my overall health improved. I would highly recommend this doctor, there's a very good reason why the reviews are outstanding and every patient is happy!< /review>< pics>

Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis are very knowledgeable in their field. After going on weeks of treatment, my neck and back feels a lot better. I would highly recommend the medical service that they offers to anyone in need of a chiropractor. To top it off, even the staff makes you feel special and not just “another” patient.<//text>< rate>

Whenever a back/neck adjustment is made, the results are effective  & satisfactory! The price of the adjustment is the best part bc most insurances do not cover chiropractor services.

They are all very professional, punctual-no needless wait time, very caring-patient comfort is a priority.  I am a new patient-about a month.  My husband and my two grown children are also patients.  We have a lot of confidence in Dr. Mansour and his exceptional care.  I suffer from lower back pain, but in a short time I have already noticed a difference.  My range of movement and flexibility has improved and I have less interrupted sleep.  If someone has doubts about giving chiropractic care a try, which I have had in the past, Dr. Mansour and his team will change your mind and you'll also be so grateful that you did.<//review>< user>

< review>
Let’s start from day one when I first went to see Dr. Mansour to you evaluate me. He was very professional in listening on what my concerns were on how I was feeling. After listening to my concerns and having x-rays done he was able to put a plan of attack on how to basically get me back to where I need to be, please be mindful he’s not the first chiropractor that I’ve seen so I was a little skeptical on what was going to happen because the last chiropractor I went to was a waste of time and money , but I couldn’t keep going on with pain so decided to try it again.
So fast forward two months later I am feeling 100% better than I did on my first day seeing him. My progress keeps getting better and better no more headaches and pain,  my blood pressure has gone down tremendously. I would highly recommend Dr. Mansour if you’re in any kind of pain whether it’s your back or your neck in which case it was both for me. I cannot only think Dr. Mansour for what he has done for me but also I would like to thank you to Dr. Kevin as well and the rest of the staff for being so professional and understanding each patients needs as they are all different cases.

Regards,
Napoleon A.<//review>

I have definitely noticed improvement in my day to day routine, not going through as much pain.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

It is with pleasure that I state some positive information about Mansour Chiropractic and his employees. On a bi-monthly bases I go to Mansour Chiropractic at 14740 Pipeline Ave Ste A in Chino Hills, as I have done for 14 years. I am 87 years old and I find Dr. Mansour's adjustment greatly satisfying. I always look forward to my next visit. The office atmosphere is pleasant and I'm always greeted by a friendly and helpful staff.  I recommend Mansour Chiropractic to everyone.<//Text>

<Text>It has been almost 2 months since I started my chiropractic care and my life has started to change. I wasn’t able to touch my toes and was only able to reach a little below my knees. Now I am like 2 inches away from touching my toes again and have regain flexibility to be able to carry my 1 yr old. Dr. Mansour, Dr. Ellis and the entire team are very professional, knowledgeable and show that they care for the patients and make you comfortable. I will definitely recommended Dr. Mansour to friends and family members. They won’t disappoint.</Text>< pictures>

I recently moved in june of last year and been a patient since august. Everyone in the office is great, they are very down to earth and professional. I always look forward to my adjustments. Since I've been getting adjusted I've seen so much improvement in my neck/back pain and my posture. I highly recommend them!</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>So blessed to have Dr.Mansour and Dr.Ellis in my life! The other day I got out of the shower and pinched something in my mid back! I was in pain instantly (at about a 7 or 8 out of 10)and was having trouble taking full breaths of air without feelling more pain. I laid down on the flat hard floor to try to fix it but it was no use. I knew I needed to go see my Dr.Ellis. I could not drive so I asked my parents to take me. Immediately after Dr.Ellis adjusted my back and neck I felt all of the pain leave and I could take full deep breaths. My back was sore for a few days like after a really heavy workout but I went to work that day standing and bending. I felt great. So blessed! Thank you DR.Ellis, DR.Mansour and all the friendly awesome staff!</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was experiencing lots of headaches, pain in my neck, anxiety and stress. As I didn't want any prescription medication due to my high blood pressure, a friend suggested to see a chiropractor. He recommended Dr. Albert D. Mansour. I was impressed with Dr. Mansour and his entire staff. They were professional, friendly and helpful. After the adjustments, the electric pulse machine have been a bliss! It relaxed my body and mind. I feel so much better and happier now. Thank you Dr. Mansour.< /text>

I have been in treatment at this office for the last 3 months and have felt the results of my visit. They are by  far one of the best chiropractic offices. Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis have assisted me tremendously and their staff does an excellent job at taking care of the patients. My pain was overwhelming and they have relieved  it. I have to give Vanessa a shout out she is is absolutely the best at what she does , her customer service skills exceed all expectations. Always greets you with a smile in person and when you speak to her over the phone you can actually feel her smiling .<//text>

I began going to Mansour Chiropractic as a result of being rear-ended while at a red light. Having never seen or considered going to a chiropractor in the past, I definitely had some hesitation beforehand, but Dr. Mansour and his staff keep a clean office, are always positive, were very informative, and explained the entire process very thoroughly. I’ve never had long waits and am usually in and out of the office within 20 minutes each visit. It only took about two weeks for me to begin feeling relief in my back and neck, and that’s not to mention the other benefits that have positively impacted other facets of my life. I would highly recommend this office not only as the result of an injury, but for preventative care as well.< /text>

<date>1592331545737<//date><rating>5<//rating><Review>This is the first review I have EVER written and it's because people need to know about my experience at Mansour Chiropractic. I am 25 years old and when I came into Mansour chiropractic I could not walk, I had been to 3 different ERs in a matter of 2 days, and had positional vomiting from the amount of pain I had been experiencing in my neck and head. My symptoms were neurological and NO doctor could find a diagnoses or treatment that would improve my condition or even my quality of life. Dr. Mansour, Dr. Kevin, and Dr. Elias have changed my life, that sounds cliché, but before my treatment I believed I would spend the rest of my life in intolerable pain and stuck on my back. The first time I went in, Dr. Elias did a consultation and took X-rays and during the first appointment, we reviewed my X-rays and they treated me that SAME day. I was taking everything for pain relief; hydrocodone, Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine. I have an autoimmune disease (eosinophilic fasciitis, fibromyalgia, & other diseases of the blood) that have physically disabled me. I lost the ability to do any precision work with my hands/fingers, I had excessive swelling in my entire body (especially my extremities), I could not straighten my arms or back, I have been completely lethargic to the point that I would sleep up to 18 hours a day with little to no physical exercise. Within 3 weeks of treatment by Dr. Mansour and his team; my energy level, mobility, flexibility, mood, pain, strength, and overall immune system had improved drastically. I now only take advil for pain and inflammation and that ALONE is a miracle. I can walk and some days even run – every day I get better. This treatment has added years to my life that I had lost to my chronic illness. I’m an advocate for this team. Not only do I have a second chance with my life, I have a new hope that I had lost. I felt seen and loved by these people and I will continue to see them as long as I am able.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1592440606438, 'text': 'So very happy & thankful for your wonderful recovery!'}</resp><GmapID>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b<//GmapID></record>

<Text>My wife and I have both been treated by Dr. Mansour. My wife had severe neck and lower back pain that was related to a automobile accident years ago. Dr. Mansour determined that my wife had brittle bones and could not have conventional treatment. He was able to help her by using another method and today she is doing excellent.

I was treated by Dr. Mansour for acute lower back pain and overall joint discomfort. At one point, back surgery was a consideration. I am in treatment currently and am doing very well. My back has straightened and feels much stronger. I feel more energetic and my joints are much better. Dr. Mansour is exceptional in the way he teaches you exercises that both strengthens and stretches your back.

His staff has been great with squeezing us in on some of his packed days. We have had a great experience with Dr Mansour and consider his therapy extremely valuable and irreplaceable!<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I was in a car accident where I was stopped on the freeway and another driver plowed into me. My neck was so bad I could barely move or walk or sit for that matter. I'm a Nanny and my job is very physical. I had never been to a chiropractor and frankly I was scared of being cracked all over. But  Dr Mansour saved the day. He was very kind sympathetic and listened to my concerns. He came up with a treatment plan that didn't involve the cracking and pulling which was a relief to me. He has the most state of the art x Ray machines and showed me what was going on why it happened and what his 1 year plan was to fix it. It's been almost 2 months now and I can move bend lift turn sit walk without any more excruciating pain. I have also noticed my sleeping and energy has improved. The staff remembers your name and always has smiles to share. I also attended one of the Dr.s seminars which was very informative and useful. Great office would recommend to everyone!</text>

I have neck issues in regards to my spine and they’ve helped increase my range of motion, decrease headaches/pain and have helped me to enjoy my life without worrying about my neck. Thanks everyone for all the wonderful team work!</Review>< Pics>

Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis are amazing! As well as the staff, they all genuinely care for your well being and strive to make sure you’re getting the proper care for the long term as well. They’re very thorough in explanations and more than willing to offer help in any area possible. Appointments are required, however, you never have to wait long at all to be seen. After coming for about a month, 3x a week, I’ve seen great improvement. Definitely recommend coming here if you need any chiropractic care.<//text>

The entire staff is so kind. I was in pain.I even couldn't sleep the whole night. Dr. Mansour took x-rays, discussed my back issues with me as well as a plan of treatment.

He takes the time to explain everything to you.  He's not just going to crack your back, but going to make sure you know what is going on, what other health issues you are having that are caused by the misalignment and do his best to get you back in line! As well as educating his patients and truly cares about people getting healthy.

All in all, I'm very impressed with the level of care offered by Mansour Chiropractic.
I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a chiropractor and I'm going to recommend him to my friends and family.  He's that good. Thanks Dr. Mansour< /Text>< Pictures>

I went to doctor Mansour because I wanted to feel Healthier.
Dr. Mansour performed a thorough testing and X-rays then he recommended a treatment that would be suited for me.
I can tell you that after four weeks of treatment I feel a lot better, I have more energy and stamina.
I’m having a great experience at Mansour Chiropractic Dr. Mansour is very knowledgeable and makes me feel that he truly cares about my wellbeing. The staff is very pleasant and the office is very clean and comfortable.
I will recommend Mansour Chiropractic to all my family and friends.< /text>

I give 5 stars for all the great things I experienced during my sessions with the Doctor. I went there for the first time as an urgent patient . First they took me right away and did their best to help me go through my pain. Dr. Albert was so patient explaining to me and educating me with everything I was going through.. everyone in the office was very welcoming and pleasant wanting to help me as much as  they could. I would definitely refer everyone to go there.</Text>

< review>
I have been going to Mansour Chiropractic over two months now, and have nothing but great things to say about my experience. On my first consultation, I simply expected a quick and easy adjustment. However, it was quite the opposite. Dr. Mansour had a list of specific questions that required detailed answers. In the back of my mind I was asking myself, why all these questions? My intention was just to get an adjustment. Little that I knew, chiropractic care goes beyond "quick" adjustments. After my first consultation, I knew I had gone to the right place. A little over two months of adjustments and therapy, I couldn't be any more happier with my progress. My overall wellness has improved tremendously. I can sit at work without my back and neck aching, I can drive without having to sit sideways (to "relieve" back pain), less headaches and stress. The office operation is well-organized. The staff is very friendly and make you feel welcomed. It is a happy, yet relaxing environment. I always look forward to my adjustment sessions and therapy because I know they are working for me.< /review>

I have been a patient of Doctor Mansour and his staff for 10 years now. First visit was back in 2007, at the old office.
Over that entire period of time,  the high level of professional help I have  received is great! The staff is friendly and always welcoming on every visit.
I am feeling better now and with the continued visits my flexibility and range of motion is great.  Thanks.</Review>

This is my experience when I visited Mansour Chiropractic for the first time.   I walked into his office and was greeted by the young lady at the front desk with a very friendly smile and a big hello, which by the way her name is Vanessa, which i feel the doctor knew what he was doing when he put her at the front desk.  She is so very helpful.    Then I meet a young doctor by the name of Dr Ellis  who was so sweet, polite.    He took some information from me then asked what was the main reason why I was there, I told him it was my sciatic pain that took me down for 3 weeks he was concerned.   Second visit I meet Dr Mansour who had such a big smile who also explained where my problem was and how it could be corrected.    We started therapy and I can tell you that two weeks I am almost feeling like a human being.  All his staff are friendly and they all greet you with such big smiles and make you feel like they have known you forever.    I have never been to a chiropractor before and I was so impressed.   I would recommend Mansour Chiropractic.</text>

Dr Mansour provides careful, comprehensive care in a comfortable and appealing environment - everyone associated with his practice is friendly, courteous and helpful!  There is a degree of skepticism regarding chiropractic treatment, but Dr. Mansour has a logical, evidence-based approach; he doesn’t want to mask the symptoms of pain, but get to the root cause. He doesn’t engage in the ‘quick fix’, but develops a careful, long-term treatment and protocols. I am very pleased by the treatment I have received at this excellent clinic!< /Text>

The staff as well as Dr. Mansour work very hard to help find the root cause & treat with a process & system that provided at least in my case major improvement in relief of pain, tightness that would develop in IT Band from injury, flexibility & overall improvement that I was not able to attain on my own.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Dr Mansour helped me years ago when my back pain was too much to bear, so I knew where to go when it happened again. Appointments are flexible and the staff is always helpful. The evaluation and treatment plan were quick and thorough. I'm already on the road to pain relief and better function. I know I'm in good hands with Dr. Mansour.< /review>

However, the aches and pains from previous car accidents was very overwhelming and I didn't want to resort to pain killers so I gave Dr. Mansour a chance. I don't have any regrets. I come here 3x/wk. I am more flexible, the pain has decreased dramatically, my sleep and menstruation cycles have improved as well. I'm in a better mood.

The environment and staff is always a pleasant and warming experience. The office provides a destressing and healing mindset, full of positivity and support. Dr. Mansour upholds the office and environment very well with opportunities for proper growth, healing and mindset. Highly recommended!<//Review>

I love everything about The Good Chiropractor and that is why I have been going there for 3 months and will continue. Dr. Mansour really listens to you and explains everything in detail when consulting you. He is always happy, charming and smiling. His office is very clean and always in order and has a efficient yet flexible scheduling system. His staff are really great too, always friendly and helpful. I have not had any issues so far. I just did my second X-Ray and saw the improvements with my own eyes and that is why I can confidently write a good review. I also feel the improvements myself (posture, strength, less pain, etc.). Another good thing is that he offers a free class to educate you on posture, stretches, exercises and nutrition which I found very very helpful.

So overall I highly recommend him.<//Review>

<text>I had never been to a chiropractor before, so this has all been new to me.  I've had lower back pain off and on for years.  My latest back spasm induced me to try something new, and after a great deal of research, decided to give chiropractic care a try. Dr. Mansour and his staff have been outstanding. From my initial consultation where they conducted tests and provided a great education on how the spine works, to the regular appointments, massages, exercises, and classes, all has been a very positive experience.  Everyone has been so welcoming and fun, even dressing up for Halloween.  Although touches like that may not seem critical, it's clear to me this fun and positive environment does a great deal for the overall well-being of staff and patients.  I highly recommend Dr. Mansour and his staff.</text>< time>

Dr Albert Mansour has helped me to sleep better, I have less joint pain, and he has helped to relieve the sciatic nerve pain in my back! His knowledge and years of experience are what makes Dr Mansour an expert, but above all his genuine way of caring for his patients is what sets him apart from other chiropractors! He is giving me back my health with each visit, and helping me to see that aging can be a happy and healthy path of enjoying my family, work, and all that life has to offer.
Thank you Dr. Mansour for caring so much about health and wellness with each patient, and for sharing the knowledge of living a healthier lifestyle!</Review>

I've had the pleasure of receiving great chiropractic care from Dr. Mansour and his team. I've had lower back pain for a long time and was sceptical of chiropractic treatment and am too nervous for surgical treatment. Was my mind changed. After just one month of chiropractic treatment I feel so much better, I am able to play with my kids more often without having sharp pains or soreness after. Dr. Mansour has provided me with exercises to help slowly strengthen my body for a better lifestyle and great information by attending his informative workshops. He and his team work very well together to make each of my visits flawless. They all know the patients by name and it amazes me of how comfortable the atmosphere is in the office. I get so excited when I know I have an appointment coming up, I can't wait to go.</Text>

<date>1403806842241< /date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>My experience with Mansour Chiropractic has been amazing. They have absolutely made a difference in my quality of life. I suffered from migraines as long as I can remember and for many years I took medication both prescribed and over the counter and nothing ever seemed to work. I had migraines 2 to 3 weeks out of a month so having a migraine became a way of life for me. I didn’t know what it was like to be pain free until I visited Dr. Mansour’s office in 2012. I didn’t know what to expect and I didn’t have much faith that it would work, but being a mother of an autistic child who needs constant attention and supervision made me search other alternatives. So I walked into Mansour Chiropractic and discovered a new world.

The staff is amazing! They are nice and extremely helpful and you are greeted by name when you walk in the office. At first I didn’t feel much different and I was starting to wonder if I was wasting my time but with the help of Dr. Mansour and his staff I stuck with it and I’m glad I did. It took sometime but in the end my migraines slowly started to decrease. I went from 2 to 3 weeks a month in pain to maybe once a month and sometimes ZERO migraines a month! I truly do recommend to anyone in any kind of pain to see a chiropractor but mainly I highly recommend Mansour Chiropractic!</Review>< pictures>

<review>From the girls in the front office, to the ladies helping with therapy and massages, and of course the amazing chiropractors, I have nothing but amazing things to say about this practice. Having been in a car accident a while back, I am in constant need of chiropractic care, and I’m so grateful I found Mansour Chiropractic when I moved to Chino Hills. If you are serious about healing and giving your body the great care it deserves, I highly recommend calling their office. I would give them 100 stars if I could!< /review>< pictures>

I am so very grateful to Dr. Mansour for helping me to manage my scoliosis. I'm not sure that I would have the ability to walk if it weren't for him. The entire team at Mansour Chiropractic are amazing! They are kind, professional, accommodating, and the results have been phenomenal and consistent over the past 4 years. Thank you!! :-)< /review>

Just a month into treatment for chronic back pain that I've had for years. Treatment has started to give me some relief. Hopefully as time goes on we'll get more of a handle on it.<//text>

I have had on going lower back pain for several years progressing to the point where sitting, standing back up and exercise became very limited. Dr. Mansour has been able to relieve that pain and allow me to lead a normal life again.  Dr. Mansour and his staff are friendly, prompt, efficient and very accommodating my crazy schedule.  They make it feel like you are going to a spa rather than a Doctors office visit.</text>

Mansour Chiropractic Doctors and staff are great as well as professional, Kind and caring.  I had been suffering with neck, back and shoulder pain for over 10 Months before getting help.  I have such positive  results from treatment  that my neck and back doesn't even hurt any more and my shoulder is much better.   I 'm enjoying a much better quality of live that I would not have without their care.< /Text>

Dr Mansour and Dr Ellis do an excellent job on taking care of their patients and they are really passionate in what they do. It’s true, you'll know right away and they have workshops you can attend and learn very useful information the doctor enjoys teaching! They take careful steps on guiding you into the treatments that you need and to keep you comfortable mentally and physically during that time. What I most appreciate is this whole place (doctors and staff) on their honesty and their opinions because they want make sure I’m all right with everything which put a lot of my trust in them and I’m very confident about it! My friend comes here and now I bring my family here and they all love it. I really recommend Mansour Chiropractic to anyone because the atmosphere at this place is so positive, everyone’s personality is beautiful, the doctors are outstanding and you will leave with a huge smile.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b< /gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1528161780709, 'text': 'Thank You Justina!

I knew that upon returning to California I had to continue my chiropractic treatment. I decided to go into the Internet and search for a good chiropractor.  I found Mansour Chiropractor. I went to his office and he did a brief consult with me and took xrays/scan. He is very personal and took time to explain the importance of receiving regular adjustment and a treatment plan for me. Overall the way he approached my problem pain has helped and is improving. He goes out of his way to provide you with emails and exercised that can be done at home.
The Staff is very welcoming, professional and helpful.  I would recommend Mansour Chiropractic.

Almost a month and a half ago I walked into the office in such excruciating pain in my necklace a lower back that I could barely function. I was living on Advil for pain most of the day. Today, my neck pain and back pain has decreased to the point of no Advil. I am so happy that Dr. Man sour and Dr. Ellis took the time to listen to my problem and said let's see how we can help you. They truly have helped so much.
I look forward to each visit as I know relief is at the fingertips. I suggest to everyone that if you are suffering with neck, shoulder and back pain and it has gone on for years with no relief as mine did, seek out Dr. Man sour and Dr. Ellis at Mansour Chiropractic as you will be amazed after the first visit how wonderful they are.
And as a side note, all the staff are the kindness, most caring women ever and when you walk in you are greeted by the sweetest young woman, Vanessa, who is so happy to see you.
I just can't say enough praise for all at this office.
Again, thank you so much for helping me on my healing path.

I've been a patient of Dr. Mansour for a number of years and still come to visit for periodic maintenance.  One thing I noticed since I started getting treatment is that not only my back gets stronger, but also my overall health gets better.  I used to get sick a lot but now I rarely get sick anymore and that's one of the reason I still go to Dr. Mansour to get adjustments and therapy.  On a personal level, he genuinely cares about your personal health and has always treats his patients with the utmost respect and high degree of professionalism.  The entire staff is friendly and the wait is never long.  I highly recommend Dr. Mansour's service.</Text>

My very good friends (husband & wife) have been patients of Dr. Mansour for several years. The wife gave me a referral card and I called for an appointment. After only a few visits I'm on my way to feeling less pain and overall better health. I've also attended 2 free workshops led by Dr. Mansour and found them to be very informative. Dr. Mansour is professional, friendly and easy to talk to. I can't say enough about his staff. From my first contact with Vanessa, Dr. Mansour' office receptionist, I knew this experience would be a positive one. Every interaction with all staff members have been wonderful. I can't say enough about this practice. If you, too, are experiencing pain, discomfort, or you just want to "feel like a younger version of yourself", I urge you to contact Dr. Mansour's office ASAP. You'll be happy you did.</Review><UserId.>116355229079307967817</UserId.>< pics>

<text>Dr Mansour and his team have been monumental is helping me deal and recover from chronic back pain. The  friendly and responsive staff have made the office visits easy, fast and very accommodating to my schedule. A variety of therapy options has helped in pain relief and the fact that they perform something different than other offices’ standard treatments is an indication of a Dr that listens to the needs of a patient.  He treats the issue not the symptom.< /text><user_name>Dyan Rambayon< /user_name><Pics>None</Pics><UserId.>108477708855232332098</UserId.>< Time>

<review>I have been very impressed with Dr. Mansour and his entire staff.  Dr, Mansour is very knowlegeable and has helped me considerably with herniated discs in my back so I don't need back surgery.  The x-rays and scans that he uses are very useful to my treatment and are way beyond the normal chiropractor's tools.  I recommend him highly.<//review><rating>5<//rating>< gmapID>

I am so beyond thrilled that I found Dr. Mansour and his friendly staff. I had been experiencing lower back pain for sometime, and I finally took action to get some relief.

I've been going to Dr. Mansour and his team for two months now and I can say it's the best decision I've ever made! Being only 26 and having terrible neck/back pain isn't so fun, in the short two months of going to Mansour Chiropractic I have been relieved of the severe pain I was experiencing and have also notice an major increase in my comfort, energy, and overall mood! I was overly impressed with how caring and detailed everyone there is. They thoroughly went over what was causing my discomfort and how they planned to fix it. Thank you for making me feel my age again Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis!<//Text>

My mother has been struggling with neck pain for months and it was affecting her daily life. We came to Mansour Chiropractic in search for treatment plans that will help enable her to utilize her neck again. We are glad to have met Dr. Albert Mansour. He is patient, sincere, and very thorough. We were told her neck pain was due to subluxation of all the joints in her neck. After one month of treatment, my family and I have noticed a change in my mother’s comfort level. Her range of motion and posture has gotten better. We highly recommend Dr. Mansour and his team!! They are good people and their clinic is always clean!! A+++<//text>

Dr Mansour and his staff are the best.  I am always welcomed cheerfully, and any concern I express is addressed right away.  The doctor is very competent and has brought tremendous relief for my wife and myself.  At 70  years of age, my life is almost pain-free,  much of which is the result of the treatments I have received through Dr Mansour's expertise.< /Review>

I'm so glad I found Dr. Mansour! His assessments and in depth to find out the underlying cause which in turn helps to treat the problem thoroughly and efficiently.  What the other doctor couldn't do in over 3 months Dr. Mansour did in less than three weeks to make my back starting to feel better.  The staff there is phenomenal as well.  They are all so sweet and very personable, making you feel special by caring about you and remembering your name from day one.  If you need a good chiropractor, you don't need to look any further.

<text>Dr. Mansour and his staff are incredibly friendly, prompt and professional.  The office almost has the feel of a spa not a typical doctors office.  What I really appreciate is that they are always on time and you are never left waiting.  This was my first visit to a Chiropractor so I was skeptical at first but Dr. Mansour treatments have removed my serious back pain and now has increased my general comfort level tremendously.<//text>< pictures>

I have been seeing Dr. Mansour since i was about 14 and now im 20 and still see him! He promised that he could help ease the pain without having surgery and he did just that. Without Dr. Mansour i probably would have had to quit sports for a very, very long time. I would definitely refer any family member or friend to come give this office a chance!< /Text>

Dr Mansour and Joshua provided excellent service as well as the entire staff.
I came in a few months ago after a car accident with whip lash and the unabilty to play with my daughter like I use to and unable to enjoy playing in social sports.
I also had limited time for full work as standing and sitting for long period of time was very discomfortable.
Now I feel 💯% myself again.
Thank you 😊< /text>

Dr. Albert Mansour has been a big part of my and my wife's health and comfort for over 15 years. Dr. Mansour has treated our pain and discomfort and helped us enjoy greater health and mobility. More than that, he and his staff have educated us and cared for us in a compassionate, friendly and professional manner. They are good and competent people who provide value above and beyond the cost and we highly recommend anyone to take advantage of Mansour Chiropractic.

I absolutely love Dr. Mansour and his entire staff!!!  I have been going to his office for almost a year now and I have been to multiple chiropractors prior, but will never go anywhere else again.  I appreciate the testing and consultations that he did initially and continues to do as my pain has improved or as it changes.  He is very knowledgeable and does an amazing job at sharing useful information regarding overall health and exercises that pertain to how I'm feeling. Lastly, I love and appreciate his staff.  They are nothing but welcoming and have always accommodated my daughter and I when we visit.< /review>

Before coming to see Dr. Mansour I was in constant pain in my neck and suffered with migraine headaches. I have been coming to Dr. Mansour for a few months now and my quality of life has improved greatly. My sleeping patterns have improved dramatically. I’m more focus and have plenty of energy. To see the results that Dr. Mansour care has done for me is amazing.  His office staff is wonderful to work with. This was a true blessing!< /review>

Like some of you I was initially skeptical of seeing a Chiropractor.  I have been a patient with Dr. Mansour since late 2015. Dr. Mansour looks to fix your physical issues with a combination of adjustments, electrical stimulation and exercise (progress is checked periodically with tests) rather than just temporarily relieving your symptoms with a few adjustment sessions.  My lower back issue has improved significantly in the past few months and have been happy with he results thus far.  The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable which is definitely a plus!  Would definitely recommend Dr. Mansour to anybody suffering from back discomfort.<//Review>

I suffered with headaches and neck pain for four days before I went to Dr. Mansour.  He gave me a thorough exam including x-rays. He then explained why I was having headaches.  I started care with Dr. Mansour and within a week of adjustments & therapy I 'am now feeling great, I 'am very pleased with the results.
Dr.Mansour and staff are Great!< /text>

Came into this office after reading great reviews online. I was almost 16 weeks pregnant with the worst sciatic pain running down my leg with every step I took! Within about 2 weeks of treatment my pain had decreased about 80%. I am hoping to continue treatment throughout my pregnancy and even after with the changes that come. All the office staff is very nice and very personal even remembering your name. Would recommend this place to all my family and friends.< /review>

<date>1473187546559<//date><rating>5<//rating><text>Dr. Mansour and the staff are very friendly and professional. I had a neck problem that prevented me from working completely and I wasn't able to sleep for more than 2 hours. For the first 3 weeks, the improvement was very weak, and I started to think that it's not going to work. But then, on the 4th week, I started to feel much better. I could work, sleep better and feel that I have more power and energy.
What I like the most, is that Dr. Mansour and the staff explain to you what they are doing in details to understand the way they work which helps you to monitor your improvement.
And it doesn't stop there, more and more information presented in seminars or by weekly emails (in form of quiz) to enrich your knowledge with several topics to make your life healthier.
Thank you Dr. Mansour for all the effort and the care that you present to us.
God bless you</text>< Pictures>

I'm glad I was able to find  Mansour Chiropractic  on the internet after I had an auto accident last year when I was frustrated and in a lot of pain... and I had the most positive experience since. My physical condition has improved consistently and now I'm free of the pain in my back! I thank Dr. Mansour, Dr. Ellis for the effective treatment they did on me. I also appreciate the support staff for their patience and professionalism! I also like Their pretty  clinic a lot!😊<//review>

<text>Been a patient of Dr. Mansour for close to 6 months. I noticed the detail and planning is different from the many different chiropractors i have been going to. First, they take X-Rays and other imagery scans in order to objectively track your progress. It's good to see progress on paper rather than a ranking from 1 to 5 since that can vary depending on your day.
Unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover many visits for chiropractor, but Dr. Mansour is understanding and tries to help you reach you goals.
Another good thing is that they take a late lunch, so they open during the normal lunch hours of 12-1pm, which makes appointments much easier as they are available during that time.
Definitely recommended since Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis are attentive and understanding of their patients' concerns and struggle.<//text><rating>5< /rating>< gmap_id>

We LOVE Mansour Chiropractic!  The staff is always so friendly and professional, and they always work around our schedule.  I first went to Dr Mansour after a car accident, and I was not able to turn my head or stand for long periods of time.  The medical doctors just wanted to fill me with pain killers.  I noticed a HUGE difference after a couple visits.  It made me a believer!  Also, after caring for my mom who was bed bound I injured my back lifting her.  I went back to see Dr Mansour, and cannot say enough about how much he has helped me.<//review>

I have been in pain for many years, from various car accidents and the kinds of work I do. My mom has been seeing Dr. Mansour  for a few months and thought he would be able to help me.  I feel so good now, only after a month, I can't believe it.  I have been telling my friends and customers how great I feel as well as, how nice and helpful the Dr and his staff are.  I am really happy with my treatments.

<review>In January 2019 my neck was strained from a subluxation, I needed to get this fixed because I had a big trip planned the next week. Dr. Mansour and his team were able to treat and care for my subluxation, neck pain, lack of flexibility, and overall mobility.
After a 3-day a week adjustment plan,
I was able to go on my 3 week trip completely pain-free! Now after a month I feel better than ever, the scans that I had done at Mansour Chiropractor showed improved results in overall mobility and flexibility.< /review>< Pictures>

I hurt my back and came to see Dr. Mansour.  I can't tell you how much better I feel. Not only is Dr. Mansour and his staff professional but they are kind and helpful. If you have a problem they will get you in almost immediately. I would highly recommend Dr. Manipur to all my friends and family.</text>

Dr Mansour and his entire team are amazing! I came here as a reference after a major car accident that my husband and I were involved in. I had excruciating neck and back pain. I have now been a patient of Dr Mansour for 2 months and the difference in my pain levels is unbelievable. My posture is also much better and I can resume my daily activities without suffering from so much pain. I highly recomend the whole team here, you will not be disappointed!</Text>

<text>I have never been to a chiropractor before, but I’m certainly glad I chose to get help from Mansour Chiropractic. Because of Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis, I have noticed major healing within the first 30 days and every time I go in, it’s a pleasant experience thanks to all the kind staff! I won’t go to any other chiropractor from now on!<//text>< pictures>

Dr. Albert Mansour is the chiropractor of my husband, two sons, and now me. I was experiencing back ache that continued to get worse so my husband referred me to Dr. Mansour.  He who took the time to explain to me how Chiropractic adjustments can help. He showed me how the nervous system works and how it relates to my symptoms.  He recommended Chiropractic Care that would restore the position, motion and function of my joints for a healthier, more active life1
I was comforted to know that Dr. Mansour's care recommendations are based on my scans and other examination findings.  This serves as objective guidelines by which my care and progress are monitored and modified, if necessary.  I know that healing is a process that takes time and Dr. Mansour supports this by giving natural recommendations for better health habits.
In short, Mansour Chiropractic cares about me and the quality of life that results in wellness and vitality.  Dr. Mansour is supported by a qualified, caring Staff who makes his office "bright and beautiful".< /Text>

<text>I have been going to Mansour Chiropractic for more than 10 years. I started with a need to treat my back. After 10 years, more than 100 miles each week on my bicycle, running 30 miles per week, and swimming 2-3 miles per week, I feel my long term health and physical conditioning depends in part on my regular Chiropractic treatments. Long term health depends on many components, one of these is regular Chiropractic treatment's.</text>< Pics>

<review>These guys fixed me up faster than expected, and made so much more progress than I was told was able to happen. They're definitely worth every penny and I highly recommend them for ANY sports injury or accident. I have total confidence in their ability to fix your back/neck/knee/hips injuries. And plus their staff is pretty cool and friendly. Any question I had, my chiropractor there was able to back up the reasoning with facts and actual evidence, rather than just telling me "Hmm that's odd." They're awesome at what they do.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have had a 5 start experience at Mansour Chiropractic. Everything from the staff and environment has helped me overcome any biased opinions that I have had in the past about Chiroprators. To begin, his staff is very professional and go above and beyond to assist me on a variety of matters. For example, I have a very busy schedule and Vanessa will always try to accommodate me with an appointment that fits perfectly around my hectic life. Also, Dr. Mansour is a master at his craft. I have been his patient for about two months now and I have surpassed my goals that I had expected. Coming in after a crash, I could not even sit comfortably at my desk or even sleep well. I now can stretch and bend more comfortably, and most importantly I can continue my active life. I would definitely recommend Mansour Chiropractic to anyone and everyone.</Review>

Dr. Mansour and staff are all very thorough, professional, and very caring for your needs.
I'm a stay home mother with 1 child and my schedule always depend on my daughters schedule of course, so that being said I always change my appointment quite often and they are still very accommodating and understanding of it too.
I love the fact the doctor takes his time to talk to you on a personal level and takes the time  to see how you are doing in the process. Dr Mansour is VERY efficient in his technique and make makes the adjustment pleasurable.
Because of the doctor fixing my problem, I can now sleep, have more energy, and live a normal un painful life that has made me overall better in every aspect. Another really great miracle is that I've been trying to get pregnant for a year and getting hopeless, I heard that going to chiropractor and adjusting your hip can help you get pregnant was unrealistic to me. But here I am pregnant!!! It is true. Dr Mansour recommend to adjust my hip to fix this dilemma. So within 1 month of adjusting my hips I got pregnant!!
And to mention the fact he gives personal exercise routines, beneficial Health food seminars are icing on the cake :)
Everyone in the office is phenomenal.  I will always speak highly of this practice and will recommend this place a 100% percent.
Thank you Dr mansour and the crew :).</Review>

I've been looking for a good Chiropractor for sometime but when I twisted my back and was unable to straighten upright it became a necessity.  Mansour Chiropractic has not only helped me to walk upright again, but also reduced the pain and made life much better.  They are a very professional and friendly place of business and I would recommend them to all my friends and everyone in need of these services.<//text>

I was referred to Dr. Mansour 4 months ago by my physician due to severe pain in my knee,neck and hip.  My goal was to be pain-free.  Since my first visit, I have not been disappointed.  I have received nothing but the best in diagnosis, education and treatment.  I can say that I have no pain now in my neck and knee; and my hip pain has diminished immensely. The staff is pleasant, professional and very accommodating.  Both Dr. Mansour and Dr. Christiansen are sensitive to my concerns, and respond with care and effective treatments.  In addition to helping correct and maintain good health, there are classes available which provide additional resources for improving our quality of life. A visit here is a welcome one.< /Text>

I went into Mansour Chiropractic barely able to walk.  I developed extreme lower back pain and a severe case of sciatica.  I had to miss two weeks of work because of this.  The help and assistance I received  from Dr. Mansour and Dr. Ellis has almost completely removed all my pain.  If I ever experience an issue like this again ( hopefully I don't) I know exactly which chiropractic office to go to!< /Review>

Dr. Mansour is an oustanding chiropractor, with a great staff. I would come with my father as a young child while he would be treated by Dr. Mansour. His professionalism and passion for the profession has inspired me to become a chiropractor. Now I that I am in chiropractic school, and also an Intern for Dr. Mansaur I’m now more excited to learn from his expertise.</review>

I had considerable problem with my back. I couldn't straighten up and was leaning to one side. I started treatments three times a week and slowly improved. After several tests to monitor my progress l was able to go to treatments every other week. I am now feeling fine. I couldn't be like this without Monsour's help.</Text>

As a physician who has treated many patients with musculoskeletal issues, I am thrilled to recommend Dr. Mansour. I have been his patient for two years for some chronic neck and upper back issues that were causing pain and affecting my posture. Dr. Mansour provided expert diagnosis and treatment, and within months the pain was gone and the posture was back to normal.

Dr. Mansour is always friendly and professional, and his office team is top notch. I am always greeted by name and treated with kindness, and the team is always on time!

I can't recommend Dr. Mansour highly enough. His skill, compassion, and friendliness are a winning combination.

I went to Dr.Mansour and Dr. Ellis for my back and neck pain they took the time to explain my condition and was very well educated about all aspects of spine and cause of my pain they suggested a couple of treatment options and I’ve been getting better after visiting them. I wish I could give them ten stars from the doctors to his super fabulous staff.<//Text>

Was very skeptical at first about seeing a chiropractor but I’m so happy I took a chance. Only a few weeks in but my neck/back already feel so much better. I would constantly feel an uncomfortable clicking sensation between my shoulder blades and a constant need to crack my neck/back for temporary relief. After my first adjustment i knew my problems would soon be gone.</review>

Dr Mansour is really taking good care of me, This would be a very nice and Professional atmosphere to check out before you visit anyone else, dont call just come in they can answer all your questions, they go on and beyond to help their Patients..</Text>< Date>

My 11 year old daughter and I have been seeing Dr Mansour and Dr Ellis for 2 months and we are so greatful to have met them. We were involved in a car accident and suffered neck pain and headachs since then our pain has been minimal. My daughter cant wait for her appointments. All of the staff have been so nice and helpful. Living a natrual and healthy lifestyle is the way to go.< /Text>

When I first came to Dr. Mansour I was barely able to walk or stand and I suffered from an occasional migraine.  His chiropractic care brought me from a disabled person to an active person.  If not for his care, I would not be able to have the joy of taking care of my grand babies and my migraines haven't returned.  I continue to see Dr. Mansour on a monthly basis to ensure this never happens again.  Thank you to Dr. Mansour and his staff for helping me get my life back on track.</review>

I went there after a car accident, for neck and back pain. Extremely professional staff and doctors. Very helpful and they are always willing to reschedule (which I did a lot). My pain decreased by 80% by the third week. I recommended to everyone.</text>

I have been seing Dr. Mansour for the last 2-3 Months and my experience has been an amazing one. I have been to numerous Chiropractors in the past to care for back problems but they only helped temporarily and the older I got the worst the pain got. He really listens to you and explains everything with detail . He is very knowledgeable and the equipment he uses I've never seen others use it.
I immediately felt comfortable, everyone in his office are always happy, charming and smiling. I can confidently write a good review, because I actually have felt much better in the last 2-3 months than I have in the last 15 years. Thank You Dr. Mansour.

So overall I highly recommend him.</Review>

<text>I came to Dr. Mansours office in August with the worst back pain ever. After so many years struggling with the same pain and dealing with daily life actives and kids.

I never expected to have such difficulty finding a Chiropractor to treat me.  After surviving advanced stage cancer and the treatments it took to rid myself of the "Big C" I was left with substantial loss of bone density.  Osteopenia is the diagnosis, a precursor to Osteoporosis. The other professionals, I'd contacted, didn't want to chance breaking my neck or back during an adjustment due to my bones weakened state.   I made an appointment with Dr. Mansour to discuss my medical history and the difficulty I was having finding treatment for my aching neck and back, for which I'd had nearly lifelong issues.   Dr. Mansour put me at immediate ease and believed he COULD treat me and my brittle bones using an alternative mechanical device method.  Well it seems to have done the trick, my neck and back are much better and my bones are all still intact!  In my opinion Doctors Mansour and Christensen excel in their field of treatment, the staff is always professional, yet you feel like you're family as soon as you walk through the door.  I'm extremely impressed with Mansour Chiropractic and would recommend their services to all.  I give each and every one of the staff my highest rating.</Review>

I am thrilled to be able to share my experience with Mansour Chiropractic and how they have helped others in my family. Years ago after trying everything Doctors told her to help cope with severe migraines, my wife tried Chiropractic at Dr. Mansour’s former location. I at first was skeptical that it would help her and it did not cure her of them but helped her when they were at their worst and would last for days. She was on a maintenance program with then and even recommended my son after an accident which was causing him problem and he was also satisfied with the results. Then it became me who needed help and did not know that chiropractic care would be of any help. My loving wife had a hard time convincing me to make an appointment but did not give up until I went with her. I was having neck pain regularly for years after an auto accident and other stress issues so I was not a happy camper. After being evaluated and shown the spinal problem, I began treatment and became happier as I started to feel some relief. So what I thought of the patient care and service I was given by everyone at Mansour Chiropractic was outstanding! It made me look forward to my scheduled appointment because I knew when I walked out I would feel better then when I went in.
Thank you for being so kind and helpful!<//review>

I was referred to Dr Mansour’s office by a co-worker.  I had severe neck pain and Dr Mansour took x-rays, discussed my neck issues as well as providing a treatment plan.  I have been treating with Dr Mansour since last November and my neck pain has subsided and range of motion improved.  Mansour Chiropractic is a full service office they are not only concerned with what hurts but provides knowledge on how to get and maintain a healthy lifestyle.<//review>

I came into Dr.Mansours' office feeling old and crippled. As a 25 y/o man it was hard to admit how bad my back had gotten. After a few sessions at Mansour Chiropractic my life was back on track to being as healthy and happy as I should be. Thank you so much to everyone in the office it really made my experience with Chiropractic Medicine an amazing one.<//text>

<review>I had never been to a chiropractor before going to Dr. Mansour. I had suffered for 2 months with a chronic cough, sinus problems and headaches.  I've had the problems off and on for 2 years and had been prescribed antibiotics,  steroids, and inhalers. I was told I had allergies and took 2 different allergy meds. Nothing made the problems go away for good. I was desperate to feel better. Then I found Dr. Mansour! He found my neck bones were pushing on my esophagus and preventing my sinuses from properly draining.  I've also had problems swallowing food at times over the last several years, most likely due to the esophagus problem. After one month of adjustments and treatments,  my barking cough has completely disappeared, my voice has returned to normal, the headaches are gone,  and I have had no problems swallowing food! My sleep and energy has improved. The staff is kind, caring and friendly,  and has greeted me by name from the very first visit. I am so grateful to Dr. Mansour, Dr. Ellis and the whole staff and I am so glad I found their help!</review>< Gmap_id>

Great staff and excellent care to each individual person. I had neck pain throughout college due to academimia and work that required hours of staring at a screen. Came in for help and they showed me my problem areas and why they were problem areas. My pain has been minimal or inexistent ever since starting as they are very thorough in making sure you take care of your body while away from their office.<//text>

I am pleased with the treatments/adjustments I have received  at Mansour Chiropractic the past 5 to 6 years or so. I was having low back pain and mid back pain associated from stress , work and past auto accidents when I was younger etc. I read a flyer one day that was in my newspaper and decided to give it a try. It works ,I can tell the difference I feel better and can do the things I need to do daily. Dr. Mansour , Dr. Christianson and Staff are Great.</review>

I came to Dr. Mansour's office with pain in my lower back and knees. Though I came for overall improvement in my health,  the dramatic change I've seen in my health is amazing. There is so much less pain in ny knees and back now, but the adjustments have helped other aspects of my health I wasn't expecting. Dr. Mansour, Dr.Ellis, and the staff here have also helped my mom after her car accident. Before coming here, she was in constant pain and now my family and I can see just how much she had gotten better by coming here. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone looking for pain relief after an accident or anyone looking after their health to come here.</Review>

I have been suffering from lower back pain for years.  The pain started when I worked in the warehouse store industry in my younger days which continued to get worse over the years.  I have had Doctors provide pain meds which only masked the pain.  I decided to find an alternative method and found Dr. Mansour.  From the first visit, I immediately experienced relief.  I have been following a prescribed program for about a month and I continue to improve every week.  Dr. Mansour has been encouraging and expresses a real interest in your health.  The staff is very friendly and helps answer any questions.  I would, and HAVE recommended Dr. Mansour to my friends and family.</Review>

I came here after being involved in a car accident. I can say that after a few visits here, I've seen the pain I had in my back go away. I would recommend this place to anyone who has been in an accident or any needs any sort of care for body pain. - Gerardo Limon</Text>

<Time>1464898103339< /Time><Review>Hi, have to give 5 star thumbs up to Dr. Mansour and all his staff.  My Mom is 88 years old but what making her live longer is her gardening. She loves her garden and can stay there all day if i don't stop her  by  explanation. I am a home health nurse as well as a nurse instructor. We tried everything when my mom started to have numbness on her right leg and progressed to both  legs, making her fall a lot.. Our last recourse is go to Phoenix for lower back laser surgery which will cost  lot and there is no guarantee that both legs  numbness will be gone. I thank God when i saw one of my home health patient improved from severe pain to almost no pain  when they re-align her spinal bones.  To make it short because of Dr. Mansour's  chiro-treatment program my mom can walk again with a least legs numbness. I still have to stop her when she stayed after 4 hours of gardening. What our family is so happy about is the improvement on her quality of life. No more depression.</Review>< pictures>

Coming here has significantly helped out my back. At the start, my lower back would hurt and it would just take me out for basically a whole day. Then, Mansour Chiropractic stepped in. In no time, I started seeing results. And in the off chance I have a flare up, I now know what to do to combat it. On top of the treatment, the staff here is welcoming and awesome. They do not make you feel like just another patient/number. Thank you Mansour Chiropractic!<//text>

<Text>I came to see Mansour Chiropractic last September in severe low back pain. I expected some therapy and an adjustment and to be on my way. That is not the only thing I recieved here. They are different from other chiropractors in the area; they take your whole well-being into consideration. Doctors Mansour and Ellis spent time evaluating my condition with x-rays and tests to give me an accurate care and diagnosis for my spine. I look forward to my appointments and always feel stronger afterwards. Every one who works there is lovely and trustworthy; Vanessa, Suzy  & Marvene feels like a family! I've been in pain for over 30 years with seemingly nowhere to turn for relief. Now I finally feel confident I can stay strong & healthy throughout my busy days.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1536082520403, 'text': "We're proud & honored to be your partner in health!!"}</Response>< GmapID>

<date>1393615365796< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I first met Dr. Mansour at our luncheon seminar in my office.  I signed up for an appointment for the following week since I have been dealing with headaches for 37 years as well as have not slept the whole night through in probably 20 years.  I went in and completed the exam and we found some areas that needed healing so I started treatment.  I have to say after only 1 week (3 days) of treatment I had finally slept through the night.  Again I remind you it has been about 20 years since I've done that.  Now after 2 weeks of treatment I have only experienced 1 day with a headache and have slept through the night almost every night.  I have found quickly that Dr. Mansour and his staff really care for your wellness and how your treatment is working.  They are wonderful there and would highly recommend anyone to seek their treatment from them.  They are not just any typical chiropratic office...they seek your complete wellness.  Thank you Dr. Mansour and your entire staff for making me feel completely at home while I'm in the office.  Sincerely, D.Dekker<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I love that they use science, xrays, and facts to point out real issues.  So many other chiropractors I've seen are fine with me coming in for just an adjustment and not real treatment.   I even had another chiropractor tell me that one shoulder sat higher than the other, then on the next visit point out the exact opposite.  Mansour had my x-rays from 6 months ago (when I foolishly decided not to pursue treatment), and showed me how my condition has worsened by letting the xrays speak for themselves.  The treatment is pleasant and I leave feeling better every time.  I recommend this office to everyone.<//review>

I Went in because of an auto accident , was referred by my cousin for the same reason and I have only felt better all the time ... I'm not a fan of pharmaceuticals so was excited when Dr. Mansour said he could fix me up . All the staff is very friendly and helpful and work with you to give you better health ...if you have back pains or are in accidents like I was you must come see Dr.mansour to get you back to healthier way of life<//Review>

<Review>It's only been about 2 months since I've started my treatment here and I can already see and feel improvements.  My neck had been really stiff, my jaw clicked, my shoulder hurt, and I got headaches and was tired more often.  I learned it was due to some subluxations because Dr. Mansour had explained it to me very well.  Now, with therapy, the readjustments, and stretches, my neck feels more flexible and I just feel a lot better.  Though I had to stop exercising and participating in strenuous activities, it's worked out better this way.  I'm on the road to recovery and better shape.  The staff here is incredibly sweet, friendly, and hospitable.
Thank you Mansour Chiropractic (: ,

<text>Omg! I can't say enough about Dr. Mansour & Dr. Ellis! Staff is great, helpful, accommodating and always very pleasant! Sciatica was really doing a number on me, & getting worse.  Saw another Chiropractor only felt temporary relief, next day pain was back.  Mansour Clinic ran xrays, & other test for mobility range and gave me a thorough explanation of treatment and what to expect. I never expected to feel better after the first treatment.  I sleep better my range of motion is improving and the tension on lower back has improved so much i'm actually enjoying walking again and doing my normal activites.  Highly recommend Mansour Chiro. you won't be disappointed.  love love love em. No joke! Your health is nothing to be taken for granted and if you felt you would never feel back to normal, then you need to come here.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I came to Dr Mansour's office about a month ago, after having bad experiences with 2 other chiropractic doctors. After being in pain 24 hours a day, from a bad car accident, I am finally seeing the light of relief. I'm greatful for the care that I've received here. I've always felt like my pain and concerns have been addressed and treated with the utmost professionalism and genuine concern from Dr Mansour and all of his staff. Im looking forward to being 100% pain free. I now know that I'm on the right road to recovery. If you're looking for pain relief or a general well being in your health I absolutely recommend receiving treatment with Dr Mansour.<//Text>

After being in a car accident and in severe pain, I had a consultation with Dr. Mansour and began treatment. When I first started going I was barely able to keep my head up without the help of a neck brace and was waking up in the middle of the night crying. After only a short time, the pain was subsiding and I was able to sleep better with less pain. The staff is also AMAZING!!! From the moment you walk in to the office you are greeted with a "hello" and they always remember your name. I have never been to a doctor’s office and feel like I am welcomed as much as I do when I walk into Mansour Chiropractic. I definitely recommend Mansour Chiropractic to everyone. I will continue to go for maintenance even when I am released from my treatment plan.  Thank you Dr. Mansour for all your help and that of the staff too!<//text>

< Review>
Oh my God! Amaizing place and amaizing team in general not just to get aliviate from that horrible pain but also a place to get relaxed and feel peace. The first time I got Dr..Mansour's clinic, I was in horrible pain that started from some months ago but agravated in December 2017 after standing or walking for long, long hours in about 17 hrs. When I got to Dr Mansour's clinic, I was crying and couldn't walk more than 5 minuts. I already tried big dosis of Ibuprofen and massages but nothing aliviated my pain. Dr. Mansour was very helpful and took great care of me. He saw that I couldn't make a desicion because of money. He was an angel and offered a free adjustment for me besides the discount on my consultation without compromise and only with the purpose to help me feel better. Later on, I managed to get my treatment with Dr. Mansour and now I feel much better. When I first got there, I couldn't think clearly and couldn't even noticed the photos on the wall. Until some weeks later, I noticed some pictures of some stars hanging on the wall. I realized how much pain I had. Today I am able to walk more and straight. I can sleep longer and I do not feel more headache and I even feel joy instated of sadness like before. I do really recomend Dr. Mansour's clinic. His team are very kind and haave great customber service. Dr. Ellis is another great Dr. He is commited to his proffession and listen to his patientes. Dr. Mansour will tell you the true about your case, will listen your necessities, and will adjust to your necessity so he can treat your problem with success. He is an angel because he is not seen at the value of your money but at the solution of your bad health and problem and help you enjoy life again. From the tip pf my heart I thank Dr. Mansour and his team for all what they had done with helping me to be able to not use more unnessary medication and been treated with love by them, get able to smille again. Thank you Susy for listening me and give me your care. Thanks Vanesa for your great service, Carmen for your help and everybody for been great. God Bless You and your family Dr. Mansour.< /Review>

The staff at Mansour Chiropractic is second to none. From the Hello, Mr. Comparone as soon as I walk in the door, to the care the Doctors provide. When I first came to Mansour Chiropractic, I was in the worst back pain I had ever experienced. The care that I was given not only relieved my pain, but got me back out golfing in no time. If I were to do this all again, I would not change a thing. Thank you, Mansour Chiropractic!!<//Text>

Vanessa (Receptionist) was awesome, I called her several times before I even went to my first appointment (I was so nervous) & she answered all my questions & even offered to help keep my kids entertained while my husband & I sat to have my consultation with Dr. Monsour. She is great!

About the Doc? He is truly an amazing person. I can not say enough about the sincere care that he gives his patients.  The moment I sat with him at my first interview, I knew he was listening to me and that is really important to me. He was genuinely concerned about finding a way to help me regain my ability to move & deal with my Sciatic pain, Dr. Monsour is even working with us on the financial aspect of the treatment. Still on my third week of treatment but I can already tell that my husband and I have made a great decision by making Dr. Monsour our family Chiropractor. I strongly suggest that you take a moment to come & meet with him, you can thank me later😉.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b<//gmapID></record>

<Name>Janay Madrid< /Name><GmapID>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b< /GmapID><Review>I was suffering from severe headaches, medication no longer helped the pain and my mother suggested I go see Dr. Mansour. She has been a patient of his for over 5 years. After an examination and X Ray of my neck Dr. Mansour quickly pointed out why I was having so many headaches. I have now been coming in to be adjusted for 2 months now and have hardly had any headaches at all! Overall I feel a lot better, healthier and more energized. I can't say enough good things about Mansour Chiropractic and the staff. I was hesitant to get the care I needed due to having no one to watch my 1 year old son, but that was never a problem at this office they help me watch and play with my son every appointment I have. I appreciate everyone at this office so much! Thank you Dr. Mansour and staff!!</Review><rate>5<//rate><Time>1441819397142< /Time>< Resp>

First and foremost, the staff at Dr. Mansour's office are incredible! They are friendly, understanding, accommodating and geniunely care about your well-being. I started with Dr. Mansour about two months ago because I was experiencing horrendous back pain. In my profession, I have to sit all day at a desk and the pain in my back was becoming so unbearable that it was having a impact on my abilty to work.  The spasms were happening daily and so bad it took my breath away.  I also had pain in my lower legs that felt like no circulation was flowing through them. The pain was constantly present. I did not sleep well at night because I could not get comfortable. Since going receiving therapy at Mansour Chiropractic, I have seen a DRAMATIC decrease in my leg pains to the point I don't even notice anymore. I have very few back spasms occurring and so I'm able to now work comfortably at my workstation without having to take asprin daily to mask the pain. I also have been sleeping like a baby which is wonderful and much needed. All of these positive changes are having a profound impact on my life since I'm not suffering as I was. I know I still have a ways to go but I'm most certainly moving in the right direction. Thank you Dr. Mansour, Dr. Ellis, and the entire staff at Mansour Chiropractic, Inc.</Text>

<text>You are welcomed and feel like you belong from the moment you enter. The staff is great and caring and always remember your name. Dr. Mansour and Dr. Christensen both address the cause of your problems and investing in your health and wellness rather than making you "feel" good and taking your money. They know how to deliver safe and effective adjustments using both diversified and activator techniques. People of all ages are treated by them from birth to 95 years old! They also take their own xrays so you don't have to go anywhere else to get them done. Makes it fast and easy to see where the problems originate. For supportive therapies they use tetanizing current, cryotherapy and massage. This place gets results and restores peoples lives to expressing it to the fullest. I highly recommended coming in to get checked and this comes from someone who has experienced bad chiropractic offices in the past and has had training in health care. Glad I found a place that restored my faith in chiropractic care.</text>< Pictures>

I couldnt run, bend over or walk very good without being in pain. I was tired of feeling like this so I did some research and after all the doctor appointments I finally found the right fit for me that would benefit me the most! It took about a month and I felt great and I was back to playing at a high level of soccer again and I couldnt be more happy!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Time>1480531462217< /Time><Review>Very happy I made the decision to visit Mansour Chiropractic.  Honestly, going to a chiropractor was not at the top of my list. With some skepticism I was was unsure about how a chiropractor could actually help, but with the constant and severe pain in my neck I was willing to try anything.  I was very tired of taking medication and was ready for any alternative.
It has been a month since I started with Mansour Chiropractic and already I have much less pain and the range of motion in my neck has greatly improved.  Imagine not being able to fully turn your head to the left and having pain when trying so.  There is practically no pain now (it only occurs once in a while rather than every day).  I'm very happy I made this decision and cannot wait to see what other benefits this provides.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dccd48355abf19:0x1defcca62b6e606b<//Gmap_id><user_name>Nicole Almanza< /user_name>< user>

<text>I started seeing Dr Mansour in October 2014 for low back pain that started around October 2013.At that time I was taking over the counter pain killers daily. I was in near constant pain. My quality of life was poor. I couldn't play with my kids, I couldn't do anything around the house, my commute to work and work was painful.

I gave Dr Mansour's office a call one day when I had had enough. I spoke with Vanessa who was very friendly and reassured me. I got an appointment the next day. The cause of my pain was a subluxated disc in my low back that I could see right on the X-ray taken in the office. I had very little flexibility in my low back at the time.

Fast forward to today. I am enjoying pain free days. My flexibility in my low back has increased dramatically. I have not taken any pain killers for my back in months. I am enjoying playing with my kids again. Thank You Dr Mansour!!!< /text>< username>

< Review>
I discovered chiropractic back in 1995 when I suffered a terrible neck injury that left me in a quandary where surgery had a 50% chance of leaving me paralyzed from the neck down. A kind and caring  chiropractor treated me gratis / free of charge, in exchange for private tennis lessons in the event I would someday swing a tennis racket again. Twenty months later, I was back on the tennis court…

A recent high-speed auto accident had me down for the count once again. Unfortunately, I was no longer able to see that wonderful chiropractor who brought me back to life (and my livelihood) as I had relocated to Chino Hills in September 2016.

In November 2016, however, after almost a year off the tennis court and out-of-commission,  I was most fortunate to meet Drs. Mansour and Ellis. I write this on March 20, 2017 and I’m glad to say I’ve eased back on the tennis court and am also beginning to train in cycling again. In addition to the wonders of their gentle and effective chiropractic treatment and care, the staff (Carmen, Marvene, Suzie & Vanesssa) is also very gifted in what they do as I’m always greeted with a smile and tender kindness. Further, everyone in the office seems to understand how busy I am as I've never waited more than 2 minutes in the waiting room and am always immediately attended to when my treatment is completed.  Mansour Chirioractic is truly an  asset to our local community!</Review>

Dr. Albert Mansour is excellent at healing!

Stop the pain from musculoskeletal injuries like neck pain, back pain, headaches, sciatica, disc herniations, and whiplash. Immediately, consult with the highly qualified, extensively trained and experienced chiropractor Dr. Albert Mansour who can help your recovery.
As a result of a car accident 10 years ago, I had a consultation from an orthopedic specialist to relieve the pain from a whiplash. The treatment was powerful pain drugs to swallow as needed.  Apparently, whiplash symptoms have a delayed onset, often taking months or years to manifest.  In my case, I woke up one morning in December, 2013 with literally frozen neck and atrocious pain that radiated across the shoulders, up into the head.  Needless to say, the same day I made an appointment with Dr. Albert Mansour.
On my first visit, Dr. Albert Mansour performed exams to locate the source of my pain and asked me questions about my current symptoms and remedies I have already tried.  He did physical and neurological exams. He observed my range of motion, and physical condition, noting movement that causes pain and he tested my reflexes, muscle strength, other nerve changes, and pain spread.  Several x-rays were taken to different positions of my neck.
On the second visit, when we sat down to go over my X-rays.  He explained what he'd found and told me why my pain was the way it was and developed a program of care that combined more than one type of treatment, depending on my personal needs. He then discussed his very reasonable fees.  Finally, he asked for permission to start the treatment.
I stuck to the program and consistently scheduled my appointments each week.  I never had issues with getting an appointment and the staff was great with reminders. The staff is professional, friendly, and helpful.  They remember every patient name, say hello when you come in and say goodbye when you leave.
I noticed an improved ability to turn and tilt the head, and a reduction of pain, soreness, and stiffness within the first three weeks of  neck adjustments just like the doctor ordered. After few months of visiting his office three times a week I could tell there was significant improvement and I felt so much better.   His Chiropractic care has truly helped me to again function normally and enjoy life.
No matter what the ailment, Dr. Albert Mansour is the first Chiropractor to call.  I can almost guarantee you will be very pleased with the results with his commitment to your health and well being.</review>

<text>I origionally went to Dr. Mansour's for a lower back injury. At that point I could hardly walk. In a short time not only had he helped reduce my pain but I was back walking again. Since then my wife and daughter both have joined the Dr. Mansour family with the same success as I had. Yes, the office staff and Dr. Mansour treat you as family and a real joy to stop by for treatments and just to say hello. I would highly recommed Dr. Mansour's for anyone looking for help with improving their health.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The ladies are amazing.  My daughter and I go every two weeks. One time it was almost a month before we could get in and our nails was just as good as new. They have also worked around my schedule.  Ann is an amazing person.<//review>

It was a very relaxing environment. The woman who did my nails was named An. She did a excellent job. Did them exactly how i asked and was very understanding and nice. I would recommend that place to anyone who wants their nails exactly how they want them.</Text>

So I have visited this salon quite a few times, but now they have a new E-check in which is pretty simple. I went to get a gel French manicure and got the deluxe. The girl who did my nails, I didn’t get her name, but she was very thorough but a bit overzealous when clipping my cuticles to the point that the ring finger bled and got a bit on the edge of the gel. Other than that, the rest was really nice! Also this is the first gel manicure that didn’t chip or peel for over 3 weeks!</Review>

<Time>1565826745186< /Time><Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Saw several different manicurists over the past year. Some were definitely better than others. However, I decided to change because the last gal actually dug around my ingrown toenail until it bled, even though I asked her several times to stop.  I never had an ingrown toenail until I started at this shop.  I've decided to move on.  I'm hoping I'll find a manicurist that will be more gentle and listen to me.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The Lady  named Lynn was very rude. Had me sit in her chair, asked me what I wanted, and I told her. She said she wanted to cut my nails down  and I said I didn't want to, so she then proceeded to to talk in Chinese to the other lady's and then looked at me and said I'm going to have to go see someone else because she didn't have time to do my nails. So why do you have me sit down in the first place.... Will not do busy here ever.< /review>

I love this place, my friends always try to get me to try new places but I am loyal to the woman who shapes my nails perfectly without correction so I dare not go anywhere else lol. (even though she doesn’t offer much as far as designs or crystals) they are a little old school in that department lol but I love them anyways they are very nice people<//text>

If I could give this negative stars I would.  Poor customer service. Very rushed. More concerned about getting people in and out and could care less about the quality of work. Been more than once and disappointed each time. Will Not be returning.< /text>

<Text>This place was absolutely horrible. It’s dirty and unhygienic, they were very rough when removing the old gel from my nails, and the gel they applied was terrible! Within two days it was hideously discolored! The gel wasn’t even done evenly...I left in a hurry, but when I looked over my nails after my next appointment I realized the gel was lumpy, uneven, and had fluff and hair sealed into it! Completely disgusting! Never going back!</Text><userid>105551719821448312060< /userid><Time>1516562142543< /Time></record>

I called and made an appt. for a basic mani/pedi which I was glad I did because they were really busy and several walk-in's ended up leaving frustrated.  This was my first time here and my experience was not up to par.  Tammy did my nails and was a very sweet gal, but she cut my cuticles way too short causing three of them to bleed.  On top of that, the paint job and her filling of my nails was not done well either and overall I feel like she was in a huge rush the entire time.  Not very relaxing to say the least and I would not recommend this salon to anyone as I will not be going back again.  Prices are reasonable and she did give me a discount for doing a bad job without me having to ask, so I do appreciate their customer service in that regard.   But I will not be returning.<//Text>

This review is Laura Strasser-although my husband's name appears in title.
This place is open 1/2 later than any other place in town. I called at 7pm and asked if my daughter and I could come in to have manis and pedis. Even though they had a every chair full they told me to drive over. When we arrived they ended up to stay open 15 minutes later than the regular store hours to finish up. These ladies drive home in Sacramento and have families with kids. I really appreciate them taking extra time to work us in late and stay open until we were done. We will be going back!<//text>

Didn’t even last two weeks and the people who worked there were very rude. Nails are uneven and crooked and not even painted all the way.</Review>

<text>I have been wanting to write this review for a while as the staff and facility really impressed me! As you can see, the place is so clean and everyone was so kind and welcoming giving a warm ‘good morning’ in every hall I walked through. Facility smells great and everyone was dressed in different color scrubs so you knew each persons role. Their care team is knowledgeable and really gave me a sense of security when selecting the right place. Thank you!< /text>< Pictures>

This facility has taken great care of my loved one!! My Father in Law stayed in White Blossom for a little over a month. He can be a pain to work with, but the White Blossom Team had him smiling and participating in all of his care. He was able to leave the facility doing things he wasn't able to do prior to being hospitalized!  They provided him with the encouragement he needed to really have confidence within himself to accomplish transfers and walking, which were his biggest barriers when arriving! Thank you White Blossom TEAM!<//review>

<review>My dad spent several weeks, on two different occasions, at White Blossom Care Center.  We were very pleased with the excellent care he received by the numerous staff members we met.  They exceeded our expectations.
Special recognition goes to Bella, one of the CNA's.
We wouldn't hesitate to recommend White Blossom to anyone needing rehab.  Even the food was good.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fcb348ac97fc7:0x82e5206094c5345d<//GmapID></record>

I can't say good things about their staff. Compassionate, dedicated, and no matter what time of day I popped in, they were treating my dad like a family member. Savannah is so amazing I wish she could be cloned and able to care for everyone's sick folks 24/7 /365.

Friendly at the front desk, smiles and pleasant attitudes and wonderful employees front to back. Whatever they make, it is not enough! The only thing I wish I could change is proximity to Valley Med. Sketchy area.

I wish the front had a security guard 24/7 and that there would be a sign in sheet to visit.<//text>

We looked into White Blossom for a family member and were amazed by service we received from Destiny and the whole admissions team! It is easy to see they truly care about their patients and patients family members during the stressful time of rehab. Would definitely recommend White Blossom to anyone!< /text>

<Text>I was at white blossom I wasn't comfortable at first ,but then I started liking it there they were so nice to me and everyday they would change the sheets on the bed and whatever we are wearing and bate us so we can feel clean. They workers there talk with you to make you feel comfortable and laugh they have bingo arts n crafts they feed you good food they help you with physical therapy to get better and they let you have visits anytime . they are so friendly and nice I recommend my grandmother there and family they do there best there to have the patient happy so to me its a 5 star.< /Text>< pics>

Found the attitude of all help giver very pleasing. The Nurses, Physiotherapist and Occupational therapist was very helpful  Food was good and they daily checked back for preferences.

Only the space was too crammed.  Also response time to call bell was sometime long. Earliest 5 min to 20 min.

Overall a very Good experience. All employees willingly helpful< /Text>< pics>

I cannot say enough good things about White Blossom personnel and facility. From the time I was admitted to two weeks later at discharge, I was treated with wonderful care and respect.
The staff are professional and courteous. They came highly recommended and I personally give them a thumbs up.</Review>

<review>I was in White Blossom Care Center for the last 10 days. I got out yesterday, Nov. 25, 2014. I was so pleased with almost every single person in that place from the cleaners to the nurses. Everyone was so kind and warm. I can't tell you how good that stay was. The Center is clean and smells good. After having a knee replacement, there is a lot of pain but everyone there was ready to help me and give me the best experience that I could ever want. I know that I have to have the second knee done and I don't want to go anywhere else but White Blossom when the surgery is done. I feel like I left a part of my family when I went home. Thanks White Blossom for making a difficult time so much better!!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Actually I would not give this facility a star at all, this facility is not fit to care for animals, let alone people.
•	Filthy conditions – dirty/used meal trays stacked on a water fountain.  Next morning more dirty trays stacked on same water fountain.
•	Previous resident’s belongings placed in plastic bags piled all over the bed next to patients.
•	Nurses more concerned with talking to each other than attending to patients.
•	Patient is not incontinent, just needed help getting up.  No one came and left her over an hour after she told them she had wet the bed.  When I arrived in the morning they still had not attended to her.
•	Room was not ready for patient even though we were given a time to arrive.  Took about an hour for someone to get a TV remote.  First response was we would have to wait until morning for maintenance to locate one.
Please visit before you choose this facility.  I doubt you will once you see for yourself.< /Review>

My husband was there for 9 days after leaving the hospital.  He got very good care and the therapy crew was outstanding/. They did a lot of exercises with him to get his strength back.The young students took extra care to make sure he was ready to come home. Thank you all<//Text>

I was not amused.

His mother left the place in an ambulance.  There was a c.Diff epidemic at the place, and the staff had put two women in her room who had c.Diff, so she caught it.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This place is filthy. Vomit tray left on sink. Toilets backed up. Sliding door to the room is broken it dont lock and the desk nurse says theres nothing i can do about it till tomorrow morning we have no maintenance person here at night but I can give you another blaket for your mom. The door is opened about an inch and its freaking cold in here. We got here at 8pm n it is 1245am and not one dang time havs anyone checked up on my mom. Then to top it off the 2 RN's are going at it like cats. This went on for at least 20 minutes. Im like what the heck, this is crazy. So the CNA see's me standing in the door watching the nurses arguing so she came to me n says "oh it happens every night, the black nurse fights with everybody.. Im like.. omg she did not say that.. I told her to report it and she said I  did but they dont do anything about it. Uuuggghhhhh... I told her that I am taking my mom home tomorrow. This is not a safe place. I even had to jimmy rig the door shut so the cold air wouldnt come in my moms room. This is a very bad place. Do not put your people in here.</Text>

After a lengthy hospital stay my father was sent there for rehabilitation. One therapist there was good with him. The "continuing care" doctor tried to be nice but was rude and demeaning as was most of the admin staff and so called "social workers and coordinators."  One thing this facility does not like is patients that speak up for themselves or have advocates and family that speak up.  Nursing staff was ok although seemed short staffed often since at times it would take an hour to get to my father when he pushed his call button. Unless you don't care where your loved goes for continuing or long term care I would not recommend them being placed here.<//Review>

<Text>Over all good stay there,they can do much better,after pressing call button,response are normally not immediate.
On discharge oct13. they order walker and shower chair(social service manager also inform me).After frequent voice message to social services, no positive reply.TIll today oct,26.i didn't get it.Now Its followed by bridge home agency.WHEN I get it?I received on 2nd Nov.
Thanx staff that they give me temporary walker(which I will return on receipt if mine).
All other care is excellent,they identify the cause of my fever etc by blood urine samples.Thanx to Dr.Chi.,physiotherapists Ankita and Nurse incharge.<//Text>< gmap_id>

On the road to recovery from a very broken leg, surgery, Orthostatic Hypotension, and the need to build strength after a 2 week hospital stay?

The White Blossom team has been very kind, respectful, responsive and helpful in my recovery

I knew checking in, that this was not some "Aspen ski lodge sports rehab center".  It's a blend of senior care and rehab, more towards the senior care

The facilities are clean. My bedsheets are changed daily. They deep clean weekly

The food is acceptable, understanding it's institutionalized for 500ish people.    It's a ton better than valley med   It's not a fancy Napa resort.   There have been some meals I did not like.  But for the most part?  It's good to give you strength to recover.

There was initially some issue working out my pain management (pill delivery) schedule.  But once the house doctor saw me?  We are on track like clockwork

The PT/OT team is diligent, working not only to excercise me, but to train me how to do it myself.   I've learned to transfer from chair to walker to shower and back.   Very valuable

This is not a vacation lodge in the Hampton's. It's a health care recovery center.  If you come in with a positive attitude, and are able to act as your medical advocate?  Or have friends and family that can?   It's a GREAT place to recover

Clariza, Sarvanez, Eddie, Ritchel, Jane, Victor, Hannah, Anandi.  I could just go on and on listing the staff who have done their best to help me at every level.

Set your expectations. Try your best.  And the Team at White Blossom WILL help you get better< /Text>

<Review>I highly do not recommend this facility for anyone that needs to have care for a loved one. I recently lost my grandmother that was not being taken care of by the staff.she always ended up getting an infection from not being changed! They left her on several occasions with a dirty pull-up on for hours! ( I personally witnessed this)I asked many different staff members to help her to restroom or to help change her and they all would say the same thing that they "will be right there"! The nurses even gave her an attitude and talked rudely to her! She told the lady that she was almost out of pull-ups and what she responded was..." Well you have been using them all up! Why dont you go get some yourself!" The night she past away my dad asked to speak to the dr because my grandmother didnt sound so good and he was worried. The administration office said they will contact the dr right away. About an hr or so later I get to the hospitol and I see the dr leaving. I asked how she was and he didnt even know she was ill or needed to be checked on. So he immediately requested in writing to have blood work done and a urinalys. About 20 minutes later the nurse tells me that he left and that they dont do any of the things he asked to be done until the morning!!! I complained and threw a fit because she was really dying. She wasnt able to breathe right and her mouth was really dry and she was keeping it open to gasp for air! She couldnt really speak and was really cold to touch. Finally a nurse came and said she was ok and that she had looked better than she did when she first started her shift in the morning!--  It was about 9pm when she said that! The ambulance was not anywhere out front either like they usually are!  I hope this does not happen to anyone else. Our loved ones depend on us! Once you choose a facility most insurances wont let you change. So I would highly recommend looking for another. My grandmother was so afraid of turning them in because she was worried they would treat her even worse.! I wish i wouldve said something before she died! I miss her!< /Review>< username>

The call button that no one's reply too which their should be an urgency if a patient press the call button. Numerous visit that I attend too my fiance even his roommate press that button and no one respond until 20 min later, really? Parking sucks bad can't wait to get my fiance home the worst care from staff is unbelievable. My fiance went to the Kaiser ER which he called me at 3pm yesterday to let me know and then his nurse calls me 5 hours later to tell me. She said she was too busy, Really 5 hours later? I called this morning to speak with a charge nurse that didn't go anywhere she said well they do get busy but I'll let the director aware. It seem like she was too busy to talk over the phone that she was just rushing off. I don't appreciate it at all.<//review>

I had an accident recently & needed extended care. A friend recommended that I try to get into White Blossom Care Center. She was in White Blossom a few years ago & had great care. It was on the list as one of the centers offered. I was able to get into the Center. I can't say enough of the care I received. Everyone at White Blossom from the CNA's, the Nurse's, Doctors, PT's, OT's, admin. staff including the top administrator are very caring and helpful. I'm glad they were part of road to recovery. I would highly recommend them.< /text>

All of the medical staff at White Blossom have an excellent fund of didactic knowledge and excellent clinical skills. Additionally, all the people I interacted with have wonderful interpersonal and social skills.
In the 6 months I've been here everyone has been very kind to me.
I intend to return to White Blossom.
I have been in other Skilled Nursing Facilities
So I have a basis of comparison. Several of the facilities we're quite beautiful however the staff  , while technically competent,  did not really have their heart in their work and  emotionally detached.
The entire staff at White Blossom really exhibits genuine caring .
A big hug and thank you to the entire front office staff, everyone at Social Services,
Jesse in maintenance, and all of my CNA's
LVN's and RN's. Also the dietician Shirley and Veran.
All my best to MJ Garcia, Harpreet., Kathleen,Stephanie, Leslie., Hong,Tranh, Phi,
Lea, Rafael, Joy, Joyce,Jocelyn,Maria, James, Martine,Shirley,Hector, Hong, Inez, Clarissa, Shiela, Onofre Ibe; Craig, and Jesse .
Since my memory isn't perfect if I inadvertently left your name out
Please know that you are cared about and appreciated!
Respectfully,
Jim Seltzer<//text>

<username>jane hink</username><date>1413514667430< /date><text>My husband has been in 3 SNF's in the past three or four years.  All have been good.  One of the first experiences to note in a SNF is cleanliness, smell, patient care, atmosphere, and relationship between patient and nursing staff. I was impressed with how this was happening at White Blossom.  And, another thing that is important to me, is that White Blossom is all on ground floor.  The care given my husband was first quality.  I would recommend this SNF to any of my acquaintances.  I am a retired NHA, so I know what to look for in a SNF.  White Blossom has high standards.</text>< user_id>

Every time I call in to speak with my father – I never reach him!
Between the front desk receptionist and the nurse’s station – it takes 6 to 7 phone calls to reach him.
Is it some kind of game?!?!?  I get put on eternal hold and I never get through – I literally have to threaten calling upper management to get through to him!<//Review>

As a child this spot was my favorite spot to eat, their food was always the best. It has been yrs. since i ate here. Today i went, my burger was definetly the way i remember it but my fries were stone cold they tasted as if they were still frozen. When i got home i had to recook them for me and my family to enjoy them. This is not the way they use to do their food.<//Review>

Of course, in and out is the best burger joint with 3 combos and a hidden secret knock menu. This restaurant was good on customer service, our cashier was on her first day and did a great job with a $60 dollar order. Honestly though, I've never been a fan of in n out but I appreciate the hard work all the front line workers have committed themselves toward. Also, whataburger is still the better burgers.</review>

I've been going to In N Out resteraunts for 30 years. Always been my favorite.  Had my first disappointing experience today. Went through the drive through.  The burger was much smaller than usual and the patties were so thin they were non existant. The taste was not even close to what it once was.Whatever they decided to change in there food is going to affect them negatively.<//text>

Has always been a great go too for classic burgers and fries etc for many years... however, the franchise should highly consider adding a second location near it's current one...the wait and the rapidly growing drive thru line is getting way out of control....<//text>

Animal Style!
The drive through line is long to point of disbelief, and the reason is because the food is great.  Skip the long drive-through line, walk inside and get nearly immediate service. The inside is open and very rarely has a line now days.  The staff is always happy and always friendly.  In-N-Out kills it.  I've never had a bad experience in nearly 30 years of enjoying their fresh burgers and fries.  The only draw back is they have very few locations.</Text>

Food Was Delicious Order Me A Double Double Combo Meal With Everything On It Cut-Half! One Cheeseburger Combo Meal with Animal-Style.  Got Another Hamburger With Pickles And Ketchup Only. Drive-Thu line was long but we waited 15 mins.< /text>

This spot is always full of people but the burger is worth the wait...not alot of options but you dont need them cause it makes it easy to order. it would get 5/5 if their fries were better and shakes..< /review>

In-N-Out Burger has never and will never be a disappointment in my opinion. Wait times can get a bit high at this location. However, the excellent customer service, cleanliness, and freshness of it's ingredients is a few reasons my family and I choose to give business to In-N-Out Burger in Visalia,CA. "That's what a hamburger's all about."< /text>

Through this pandemic, I've noticed the drive through lines getting longer and longer. IN-N-OUT has figured out a way to keep everyone fed, and in decent time too. You can go inside and order for takeout, or they have their patio open for sit down dining. For the drive through, there's an employee outside taking orders, so the wait time is cut in half! I was in line for no longer than 15 minutes! Thanks IN-N-OUT for being delicious and efficient!!< /Text>

The Chick-Fil-A of the west but much, much better.  Expect similar lines -- that is to say, there's always a convoy at the drive-through.  If you can go when the lines are short it's a great experience.  I think they're some of the best 'fast food' type burgers around.<//Text>

In and Out takes fast food to a new level. Their burgers are hot, ingredients fresh, lettuce, tomatoes and onion tasty too. You can get a protein burger wrapped in lettuce or figure out the secret menu and you can have a fun variety too. I forgot to say that it's really affordable too.

We didn't wait too long for our food. They were polite and friendly, great customer service. Fairly clean and Food was delicious, which is why it's always packed.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLcxq_kqAndhOw6xRcoc55vDn4Rv-yk6_5XpOO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Was a bittersweet CA visit this go around but made the most of a bad situation starting with some needed In-N-Out right off the get-go. Service was friendly and quality was on par (animal fries!) however they could use a bit of process improvement to streamline the drive-thru as the wait was a bit painful.< /review>

<Review>The best place to get hamburger in Visalia is In & Out. Yes, there is always a big line but it's worth it. The smell and the taste are so good. I love them you have to try them. They have some tables that you can sit and enjoy the beautiful day!<//Review>< pics>

Service is always superb! Prices are always great! I have only one BIG complaint though! With them being so fantastic brings a lot of business. The problem is it's always a full house and we have to wait for someone to get up to be able to set down and people are always fighting for a table! The restaurant's need to be twice the size to handle the congestion! The one thing you can count on is that you can visit any In-N-Out Burger and expect the absolute best food and service which makes them #1 in my book!<//text><response>None<//response><UserId.>113708491158809257950< /UserId.>< pics>

< review>
We love going to In-N-Out Burger because their fries are gluten free since nothing else is cooked in the oil. Many places claim their product is gluten free but it isn't. The product might be flueten free but not the oil since they cook other products with gluten. How do I know, because I ask if only fries are cooked in their oil. By cooking it in a contaminated oil, the fries are not gluten free any more. To make the burger gluten free, I just order it protein style.</review>

This place is always packed. But despite that, I'm always given exceptions service and my order has (thus far) been accurate every single visit. I got here fairly often and even though there's a long line, the wait time is fast given how many people they help. Amazing food, kind speedy service, and accurate order. What more could you want?! 👍< /text>

Immaculate restaurant. Friendly employees and excellent customer service; always a smile here. Always! The hamburger is delicious. It's so huge it's almost impossible to get your mouth opened wide enough to take a bite. The crowd is a diverse crowd., always friendly and courteous. The prices are under $10 which includes hamburger, fries and a drink.</Text>

Fast got the order right ordered a big order for 8 people. Not a long line inside due to covid you have to have a face mask to enter. I don't recommend using the drive thru if your in a hurry drive thru line always blocks a lane of traffic an accident waiting to happen but other than that it's great.< /Review>

You can't go wrong with a double double! The wait is long of you decide to use the drive-thru. When ordering inside they are quick. Love the food and the great atmosphere by the staff friendly and ready to serve!<//review>

<name>Lisa Claussen</name><Date>1533866977610<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Disappointed. Walked in floors were sticky and black across the entire restaurant. Tables clearly had not been cleaned off. Received our meal and the grilled cheese (a cheeseburger minus the meat packed lettuce). When shown to a worker, she said it was in there. At this point, we were frustrated with the lack of cleanliness and In-n-Out is known for super clean and friendly restaurants, that it wasn't worth the energy...then she came over with a wrapper of lettuce correcting the error. We will try it again, but please clean the restaurant.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhzJsKqoWp8QZ7dowmbVztWAKLxOn9Gona2AMl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUcDhEyL27pfZE5zoqrK5TggOTXt8_gRF3bDke=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Everyone loves this place that's why there's always a long line. But the line goes so fast. My grandson works there and he loves it. He's been there for a couple years and he's trying to move up into a management position. I am so proud of him. I had a hamburger and fries and it only came to $4 and some change. Now that's reasonable. And you know how good the food is.<//review>

Worst In N Out I’ve ever been to. They’ve consistently got my order wrong for the past six months. My wife and I even emphasize how we want our burgers and all we get is attitude from the girls that work there. The only reason this In N Out is in business is because it has no competition. This In N Out would not have five stars if it were in Los Angeles. I’ve been eating at In N Out for over twenty-five years! I’ve  eaten at almost every In N Out from here to Texas and this one is definitely the worst one. I recommend paying the extra five dollars and going to the Habit Burger up the street.</review>

I'm a truck driver, and many restaurants have refused me walk up service during Covid 19. In n Out was gracious enough to allow me to order, and bring it out to me. Excellent food, and MAJIR PROPS to the crew in Visalia. You have ensured that I will return. Thank you much from a South Carolina trucker</text>

Always fast and efficient. Food is usually accurate and we don't have issues getting our order wrong. The lines are always long because everyone knows where the good burgers are. Every employee here should be proud to work at the most popular joint in town. Can't get enough of their grilled onions, sweet and carmelized. Writing this is making me hungry, off to grab me burgers and fries!</Text>

The food was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The line for the drive-thru is crazy long sometimes, I suggest that you go through the inside for quicker service. The place is pretty clean and they clean the tables constantly which is nice. Overall it's a good place to grab a bite.<//text>

<Review>I love in-n-out burger. I have a very sensitive digestive system, so fast food always makes me sick. Since in-n-out burger is all fresh ingredients, I can actually eat here without getting sick. Even though the menu options are small, there are a lot of options on the hidden menu. Just look it up online. Even though they are always really crowded, they work fast and wait is not too bad.<//Review>< pictures>

Most days they are absolutely great always have a long line but they improved on it by moving the line out of the way of traffic. They are always super fast for the length of line in the drive thru. Inside can be a pain as you have to wait to find a table or share with strangers but it's fine if you take it to go. The fries are always cut fresh in store and taste amazing.</Review>

I am addicted to this place. It smells wonderful on the outside and it tastes even better. Food is always fresh and the staff is always chatty and happy. Great place.
Only down side is how busy it is and the huge line of cars in the drive thru. This has become a bit dangerous to navigate. Please open a second location!</review>

Food is good, the burgers especially. Price also very cheap. The lines are always very long, interior is a bit bland but i guess it is in style. The fries were not crispy. Their style is soggy, i didnt really like that.< /Review>

The food is always fresh.  No soggy lettuce or tomatoes ever. And the employees always have a smile on their face, no matter how busy they are. And they usually are busy, which shows that quality food and employees that are treated well really pays off.</review>

Seriously the best burger and service at any fastfood chain. Well worth the lines. The price is just right and we will continue to enjoy for many year's. Thank you in-and-out for being consistent.</review>

I love In-N-Out but the Visalia location always seems to have over cooked fries. It only happens at this location.

UPDATE: Changing my review down to a one star rating. This is two times in a row that they have added everything to it and not just put spread on like I have asked. Frustrating.<//Text>

This place is always packed it's nuts... Cars polluting the air while they wait in drive thru for 20+ mins ....just idling. Waste is left in neighboring parking lots by the ton! In n out should be called.. Idle-N-Litter.< /review>

The wait was really long, as always, but we didn't mind that too much. The staff was rather friendly. My issue comes with the food. The fries were pretty good. However, our burgers were not very good at all. I don't really know what's happened over the past few years but this place seems to have gone downhill quite a bit.< /Review>

< Review>
So most of you know people literally wait forever to eat burgers here. I personally find the burger a 8/10, fries 6/10, and shakes 9/10. I don't like the how messy and dirty the place is. Everytime I go, I clean the tables myself as people don't know how to clean after themselves.  don't like how we can't find tables, and don't like the wait. I come here once in while only because of friends and family. I prefer they open a second location but I know that won't happen. if you have the time and patience go for it, but if in a hurry skip it.</Review>

We, as a family eat at In-N-Out at least twice a week after bowling nights, I started eating at In-N-Out in the 70’s when I would visit my parents in Baldwin Park. In-N-Out has never disappointed, nor have they ever gotten my order wrong. Kudos In-N-Out, to many more years....< /Text>

Awesome food and service. It was early afternoon on a weekday and the place inside and drive thru were loaded and they were still quick to get our order inside. Tables were cleaned as soon as people got up to leave and new group ready to sit down again. Awesome place< /Review>

I like it, it's always busy. Even inside, but you get your food sooner it's just that you have to try and find a seat to eat. The burgers are ok.< /Text>

Best burgers West of the Mississippi in my opinion. Always fresh and fast with friendly efficient staff. Open very late on Fridays and Saturdays. Very clean, laid back atmosphere.</Text>

Best burger place in town, great friendly service, somewhat of a wait but well worth it. It would be nice if we had a new location on the east side of town....family friendly.<//Review>

<review>I don't like or ever eat In-n-out burger, I get it for the family then I grab Burger King right next door. I have a relativele that sells. Meat to local burger joints in town, and with that knowledge of the places that buy the most interesting meat, I've made my choice of what burgers I'd never in my life eat again.</review>< Pictures>

I thought; If I basically liked in-n-out could I just order the double to make up the difference? It is only a dollar more. Hmmmm. Let me think. Burger King. No Whatta Burger. No.Five guys. NO. From my own kitchen. Yes Same price. Huge 80/20 burger x2.</review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>105594437322447230176< /user_id></record>

Great place... great employees.... But the line that stretches all the way out into walnut ave. Every night that creates a traffic jam is not cool... Another location is greatly needed in visalia california.... Its not the ability of the people that work there that create the quagmire.. You can only serve customers so fast... You can't make things cook faster than they actually can... Get it together in-n-out people love your burgers... For good cause.. Food is great but the amount of customers overwhelm one location</Text>

What can I say about in and out. They are the best burgers there is! I don't know why they decided to add pickles after all these years of perfection. If it ain't broke don't fix it. No pickles!</review>

<Text>I give 3 stars since the service is prompt and the store is clean.  The food is not overly processed and is made fresh.   Obviously they're not a higher end restaurant.  But it's not going to be beaten by the other fast food joints.  If you're in a hurry I would not use the drive thru.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Always consistent burgers! You could eat here or in Fresno, and they are made exactly the same. Excellent food try animal style burgers or fries for a change of pace.< /review>

It's In-N-Out. This location is always busy, crowded, long lines. However the streamlined approach to making the food creates a pretty short wait time. So don't despair when you see that long long line. It's worth it.
Tasty burgers. Consistent​ly yummy food.
I'd recommend ordering the fries "well" or "extra well" done, as they regularly are quite limp and anemic.</review>

<Review>Hard to say anything bad about this place.
the food is always good, the service is always fast and friendly.
They really need another visalia location, it gets packed before and after lunch. There are about 15 cars in line and the parking lot is cramped. That tells you how great this place really is.</Review><time>1555278039562</time>< Rating>

Visalia In-N-Out is always packed for a reason. The food is consitently on point and for the amount of traffic they receive they are exceptionally fast with getting orders out. The employees are friendly and good at getting orders correct everytime I've gone. I definitely hope they put one in Tulare soon.<//review>

I wish they would fix the parking lot because it has gotten to the point that accidents are going to happen.
I would die for In N Out's food but the mess that the lines have become are making it not worth it. I've been coming to In N Out since I was a little kid and am in my 20s and this is the worst it has ever been.</review>

This place is really good and they get you your order quickly. Disclaimer:this place is full and loud so if you are more of a quite person dont go here. Other than that they gave me my order wrong and I think its because there was alot of people and I wasn't really satisfied but it was really good.<//Text>

The hamburgers are ok...It's not the best hamburger 🍔 either tho...To be honest it never gets me full...I dont like it that its always hella packed...I only go tho when my brother in law wants to go when we go to Visalia...But if it were to be for me and my husband we prefer Burger King 👑 or Jack in the Box...< /review>

Its in-n-out of course its amazing. They always are quick but they do have a long line on account of the way theyre set up on the corner so it seems like more cars than normal but its worth it. They are always fresh and tastes amazing.< /review>

<Review>Yes, I had to try the In--Out Burger restraunt place while traveling. I do not like to eat at Mc D's type plastic fast food & mystery meats drive thu's. Don't hv in my part of country. My boys wanted try, so we did bc it was late & not much open.  We all saw lines wrapped around building & wondered WHY ? So we all tried burger meals,doubles for boys loaded with toppings. Being leary I tried a single
burger& fries.
I was pleasantly surprised the burger meals were  decent & hot. Toppings made the flavor..& burger Not meat quality!!
(I raise beef cattle side hussle -know quality & grades)
Very thin meat patties. I can see why most ppl were ordering doubles. Very
REASONABLY $ for a whole meal that includes a fountain drink. $6-$7.99
GOOD for a occasional meal, but would NOT EAT on regular basis.I don't really think it's that Heathly at all. It's a CHEAP meal & a FAD.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The burgers are good. The fries leave a ton to be desired no matter how you get them. The place is almost always packed but they are usually quick to get your order out.  Definitely take advantage of the not so "secret menu".< /Text>

Parking and drive thru is insane. Burger buns are greasy got my order wrong twice the once part was that it was just one meal. They have their employees outside with no shade, no water, sweaty like crazy trying to get order through. Each time I go it's getting worse.< /Review>

It’s impossible to find a table... If you want to sit with a group bigger than 4 - practically impossible.... The drive through is worse than the dining room... The line extends out into the main street half the time. So, there you go.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>Still very slow. Wait is too long!!!! They need to increase cooking capacity. They have a small flat top to cook burgers in. So they can only cook a small amount of burgers at a time vs the amount of customers coming in.< /text>< Time>

<text>Plenty of food all around but sometimes it's just good to have a simple but great burger. The only thing I would change would be the fries, they're ok but just need more robust and filling, they actually get hard quick and taste more like cardboard. Other than that, great burger joint.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

Lines are always crazy long but they get you through quick and the good is exactly what you order. Seems like getting what you order is a big ask. Some "Guys" can't seem to get it.</Text>

Always busy, but sometimes they serve you food fast. Everybody loves In-N-Out Burguer so it worth sometimes the waiting line. The team do a great job keeping the place clean.<//Review>

Peppy, friendly customer service. We have a big family and all like our burgers a little differently. It doesn’t seem to matter which In N Out we go to, they always get it right. Long drive-thru line for lunch, but they are quick and efficient as ever!< /text>

The best In-N-Out Burger in the central valley. yes the drive-thru lines takes forever but when you have 15 cars in line and 20 people dining in, it takes a while. but when you finally get your food its tastes so fresh, Clean, and well cooked. the employees are always friendly and i can honestly say I've never had nor have i ever heard about any problems with this particular In-N-Out.</Text>

<Text>A true staple in California! Dont forget to look up the online "secret menu" as it has fan favorites such as the "Flying dutchman" or the healthier option of "protein style". Make sure to try some of their lemonade and of course grab a few spicy chilis on the way out.

When very busy, this particular store seems to lose quality. If the line for the drive-thru is more than 5 cars, you might want to eat elsewhere. When slow, fantastic food!<//text>

< Review>
This place has delicious burgers. If you have not asked for animal style on your burger, yet, protein style for your burger (which means lettuce wrap instead of buns), or spread for your fries, then you are missing out. This is also a good place to dip their fries in their milkshake. It has a simple menu, and a secret menu online, so be sure to try some of these secret options. The lines can be long, reaching out towards the street. This means it will take 15-20 minutes to get through the line of cars before you are on your way out with your food. They are usually quite busier than any other fast food restaurnt around, but they move the line pretty fast compared to the others as well.</Review>

<review>Can't go wrong with InOut! Had never been to the Visalia location and they didn't disappoint either. Was worried when I saw the huge Drive In queue but we were served quickly inside, can't see the point of sitting endlessly in your car when you can enjoy the atmosphere inside!</review>< pics>

<review>This a wonderful FAST-FOOD restaurant but there are always two manny people the dont salt the fries or the salt them to much the burgers are full a grease and there small so the wait is not evan worth it. I do not recommend In-N-Out if you have not gone don't go its better if you go to somewhere like McDonald's or jack in the box.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My only complaint is that the wait times can get long and sometimes there's no place to sit and eat when you order in. Other than that the quality of the food is top notch. Same goes for customer service.</Review>

<username>Nathan Moffett< /username><Review>As always, it’s In-N-Out! I love the food. The downside, and it is a BIG one, is the parking. It is horrible during peak times. I would highly recommend parking at Orchard and walking the short distance during and around lunch and dinner, otherwise you may struggle to get in or out. The drive thru often backs up onto Walnut so using the access at the far west end of the parking lot is always my strategy. Great food, terrible parking lot/drive-thru layout.< /Review><Date>1534006270294<//Date>< Response>

Well, I USED to tell everyone how wonderful the food was... But this time, my burger tasted dry, fries tasted old...I was disappointed to say the least. Perhaps it was just this in-n-out burger, I will probably never go to that place again.. But I will cont to go to in-N-out burger at a different location!! I haven't had any other bad experiences at other locations</Review>

Best burger you can get dollar per dollar in America.if you want the best burger in the world get a triple triple protein animal style with added regular onions and a sauce on the side. It will melt in your mouth and you will be hooked like crack.</text></record></dataset><record>

A California staple how could I not give it 5 stars. I love this place but this particular location is usually very busy and the drive thru lines circle the parking lot. Its difficult to find a place to park on a Friday or Saturday evening.  If you manage to find a parking spot close to the restaurant be careful, because you could end up blocked in my other vehicles waiting for the drive thru. I suggest parking in the adjacent parking lot Orchard or other. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope they open a second location soon!<//Text>

For being always insanely busy, this place is never too long of a wait. Parking just may be tricky with the drive through line that is always wrapped around the lot and out to the main Street!< /Text>

<Text>One of the Best Burgers, Fries, drinks.
Great Shakes and Everything is made as ordered. Beautiful cordial Staff.  Delicious food, open late and the has both family dining & drive thru. Takes a moment to get thru drive thru because the food is great.
Meal is made to order and much more. Right across from The Mall, on the corner of Mooney Boulevard and Walnut Avenue going West in Visalia, California.

This is the In N Out that made me fall in love with these classic burgers. The service is always great and the location is prime since you can make easy lunch stops after some shopping. The lines can get very hectic both inside and through the drive through window.</text>

When I went to ask for the other two they kept ignoring me. all and all after a 10 minute wait I decided I didn't need the other fries. Felt  ignored. After I threw the receipt on the counter and walked away. Then they brought me the fries. I sat there seeing them pack and give fries to every one els but me.. What ever. Never again. Plenty of other friendly hamburger places to eat.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Nah! I keep visiting these places just to really find that amazing thing most people talk about but they are just very generic, there are way many better places to have a hamburger but here, 5 guys are way superior than here, I just don't get the hype!

And tastes like artificially flavored, but really its the ridiculously long line that i really hate. They try to make it go faster but 30 Minutes in a drive thru is ridiculous, i rarely find the foor worth the wait.<//review><Date>1531691529583<//Date>< user>

I'd give it 5 if the wait weren't so long. Drive up always extremely long line and inside is just as long. Never enough seating inside. Great food at good price.</text>

This In-N-Out never disappoints. I go here just about every time I'm in Visalia. I'm a big animal double-double and regular fries kind of guy. I highly recommend that combo if you haven't had In N Out before!</text>

<Text>I ordered a veggie burgar, I was so disappointed!! It only had letteus, and tomato!!! I guess that big cut of tomato was my veggie patty!! No onions, I guess onions are not vegtables. To top it off the frys were burned, you could also taste the burned oil! Was not happy.< /Text><GmapID>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b<//GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<Text>They will put a burger together to your specifications with a smile! My son gets 4 by 4's. I get cheese sandwiches. BUT the main thing I like about the food is that the FRIES are fresh cut, cooked in vegetable oil and no meat products are cooked in their oil. Order your food Animal Style for a delete!

I had no idea what animal style meant and the guy at the till spent the time explaining it to me for which I was very grateful. Then I proceeded to eat what was in the top 5 burgers I've ever had and all for $4.<//text>

Who doesnt love in and out? Everytime I go it always has alot of people, and its only obvious that its always packed because the quality of there fast food is great. By far In-N-Out is the best buger spot compared to other buger places hands down. They need to expand to other places to meet the demand.<//review>

I like In N Out, the food is good and cheap. The only problem I have with this particular restaurant is that there isn't that much space to sit, especially if you go during peak hours.< /Text>

You see the name you know what to expect and what your getting. But expect a long wait if your in the drive thru. Other than nothing sets it apart from any of their other locations, but that doesn't diminish  their rating and quality.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) (Joh 10: 9) I am the door: if anyone enters through me, he will be saved, or he will come in and come out and be sentenced.

There are so many people at lunch.
