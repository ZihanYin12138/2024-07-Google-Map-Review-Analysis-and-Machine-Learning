The worst clinic I’ve ever seen gives you medications and doesn’t tell you the side effects you will have. All the doctors are always booked so when I need to speak to my primary doctor because of the bad side effects I’m having they give me an appointment three weeks from now. Very bad service.</Text>

At Urgent Care I got no insurance & was recommended by cvs walk in clinic who wouldn’t take me. So I go and pay the $75 fee. Everything was good up until I got home. The nurse practitioner “czar a.” forgot to call in for my medications. So I call in (20 min waiting time) and the clown on the phone tells me they don’t open till Tuesday. It’s Saturday rn. Good thing it’s not an major emergency I would be dead rn. So I’m just sitting here in pain. There was no point in paying 75 bucks. Such a waste of time< /review>

I have seen dr papa for the last 5 years....he is such an incredible person. He really cares and listens to all of your concerns, good Doctors are very hard to come by I couldn’t Imagine trying to find another like him. I almost gave up on this place until Dr. Papa came.!</text>

This is the worst place, to come to please people don’t come to this clinic it’s pretty much a scam. I’ve had back pain for 2 years, now this people wouldn’t do a damn thing, they were just scamming me for my money. If you don’t care about getting scammed, than be my guest. Plus nobody there really speak proper English.<//Text>

Horrible women’s health.. I made a call to inform my prescription was running out and that I was also due for my annual exam. They schedule me for this visit and all they do in the 45 minutes that I’m waiting in the exam room is write a refill for a prescription I’ve been on for over 7 years, a visit was not needed to do that. This should always be done over the phone if a follow up on a new prescription is not needed. Then they tell me I need to reschedule my annual exam as I wasn’t due yet (the following month), so I go to the front desk where THEY come up with the date of 2/7.. I was never told an exact date this could be done at the earliest. I just received a call that I would need to reschedule this visit that again that THEY scheduled for me because that’s 20 days from my annual exam being due. Fairly certain my bodily makeup isn’t going to change in a 20-day span and I know from my own personal work within Medicare and private insurance that this visit does not have to be completed 365 days from the last one. I’m already over this office having me take time off work for a visit that didn’t need to happen and a co-pay that I didn’t need to pay, and now you’re telling me the time I’ve taken off work for the second visit THEY scheduled me for can’t happen on that date? No, lose my number, I’m not your patient any longer. You had one job, scheduling..< /Text>

Miss this place. I moved out of state and haven't found a better place than this. Dr. Jose and Joseph Carroll were my Physicians. Joseph Carroll was great at listening and if it wasn't for him they would have never discovered my cancer in time. I have on-going health problems and I always felt taken care of at Borrego Health. They always did their best to get me in. Dr. Naranjo is also great. They have a great mental health clinic. As I understand it, They were going to add some
Mental Health Physicians for children. I am not sure if they have but it would be great to check out if you are searching.</text>

I went in after my car accident and had to pick a primary doctor which was a little difficult due to me not knowing any of the doctors. Almost everyone who I spoke to recommended doctor Stewart Wilkey. Staff, family, and friends suggested I chose him as my primary doc. He was very quick to meet with me and I didn't have to wait at all. He was super friendly and professional, not only did he perform his job and prescribe the right medication, he also took the time to ask about the accident and what kind of car I drove. I've had 2 primary doctors before Dr. Stewart and by far hands down this was my best experience. Hopefully you don't need to see a doctor but if you do then definitely consider him. I actually look forward to my follow up on Thursday.</Review>

<Text>Best medical clinic/center I have ever gone to. I wouldn't change it as my primary doctor's office unless I were forced for some reason. Most of the doctors are fantastic, though there are a couple who are... questionable, but it might be that our personalities clashed. It happens. But by and far, I love my medical center and doctors!!</Text>< user_name>

I moved to San Diego about a month ago and I decided to take my month old daughter to Dr. Figueroa as her pediatrician. Dr. Figueroa is very opinionated, but a very good doctor. I would have stayed if I didn't have to deal with the nurses and the front office. They are completely incompetent. They were not capable of calling in a prescription, they DO NOT answer the phones, even when you say it is emergent. This happened to me on 3 different occasions. I simply do not understand why these women do not care about the patients. I would NEVER suggest going here. Find yourself, and your children a doctor that is capable of managing their practice.</Review>

This urgent care is the best urgent care I've ever been to! The doctors are polite and so are the medical assistants and nurse's. I'm always in and out within 2 hours. Excited to try the family practice.. I will re- review after trying the family practice..</Review>

So I canceled my job for today because yesterday they left me a message and when I called them back to confirm my appointment the girl at the reception told me to be here tomorrow at 1:00! So I showed up today February 5th, and when I told the girl at the reception I have an appointment with Dr. Paige at 1:00 she told me your appointment is tomorrow and not today. I am not mad but seriously get it together! No matter what you’re going through always make sure you give an information correctly. It’s health care facility and not a fun hanging out appointment that you canceled that last minute. And I have a job I live off and I lost nine hour shift and money because of your wrong information that’s given.</review>

<text>If you are considering losing your health and your family 's health go to the Centro Medico El Cajon / Borrego Health. This center was one of the best centers in the El Cajon city, but now it is the worst one. There is no respect for the patient, the administrative staff is bad, they prefer the computer to the patient's life. Have you ever seen worse than this?< /text>< username>

Worst clinic ever. They have to change the management staff for sure. I had an appointment two weeks ago and they had me waited for almost 35 minutes without being seen by the doctor yet. I talked to the manager and left the clinic. After few days, I recieved a mail saying that the doctor wants to see me to discuss my lab results and I made another appointment and they promised me if I can be there at 8, I will be seen right away. Here I am,  I waited over 30 minutes just for the doctor to tell my that my lab resutls are good.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLINIC< /review>

I have had so many unpleasant experience here. There so many incompetence MD and NP are working here including their rude office manager. All they care is making you sick so they can visit you more often. I was told by 2 different MD that my Cholesterol is high, then I refused them they find out that they are looking at somebody else's lab result. Love yourself and don't go to this building. I have changed my PCP since they have refused to refill my meds despite the visit and lab work done a month prior, I bet they think I am somebody else. Don't visit these people.< /Review>

<review>This clinic has moved too Magnolia and Main Street. And This clinic is now dumping patients on the emergency room not getting any quality care. And it is very degrading to the patients in pain. I had met a woman that had a child three days earlier. And she went to this clinic and told to go to the emergency room. She was at the emergency room for over three hours not seen by any doctor. This is blatant patient dumping for profit. I believe it is a felony refusing service to provide adequate care for patients. My spouse should have been seen by her doctor or urgent care doctor. And she was not seen at two emergency rooms being considered a low priority. So the emergency room can deny service by making you wait for ever. Sincerely Matthew Melley<//review><pics>None<//pics><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_id>

They are okay now; better than before. The waiting used to take forever like 45 mins now its 15 mins. I take my kids to dr, F brenda she is such an amazing doctor; i love her attitude and how she makes things clear to you. For me, i see T. Tamara. She is amazing as well she is very smart and knows what she talks about. I love them both. The other staff are just okay. I wish their nurses smile more and be happy to be working there. When i try to make a joke with them some of them dont reply back or say anything you say even if it was funny. Please hire more professional staff to make your clinic more friendly and patients will be also happy to be there. Dont hire those who are not experienced enough and you hire them just because they speak Arabic and little English. Maria the manager is nice she listens to your probelms with her staff and she tries to fix them. Not the other manager i fogot her name she listens but never acts. Maria is more serious and she cares to make this place better.</Text>

<text>i was a patient there for almost 3 yrs and during those 3 years i had issues with the staff and the doctor...i had problems with my tummy and i told dr carroll i was seen what was going on and he never sent me to have test or blood work tested..these was a conitnue issue nothing was beening done, all i was given was pills and thats it. until i looked on the internet and i found out i had ibs and i told the doctor carroll and he still wasnt doing nothing about it..until this landed me in the hospital ( which i was in for a month and a half ) i had diverticulitis which half of my intestine had to be cut and i have now a stoma. i feel this could have been prevented if this doctor wouldve listen...after this my apptments were been ing change/ cancel or the doctor  carroll was not there.....i spoke to the manager about what had happen and how the staff was with us ( claiming they call  or trieding to give a appt of there choice) she spoke to them and they were nice for a while but then they turned out to be rude a few mos later...my husband and mother in law and myself change to another clinic and now we are beening heard, my doctor on top of my problem and its wondeful there......check around first then coming here..:/<//text>< gmap_id>

The Dr I dealt with was beyond rude. She didn't understand what I was saying. After explaining several times, she ended our appt making it seem as if i couldnt speak proper english. She also didnt explain the blood work and left saying that id see the results on the discharge paperwork, and to see another doctor.

That left me not only unsatisfied and having to Google my results...but in the hospital within a week.<//review>

Never expect to be seen at your appointment time, but if your 10 minutes late they will turn you away. Speak fast because the doctors will rush you to hurry up. It usually takes 4+ visits to get a referral for adults but same day for children. The doctors and nurses are good if you can get in. There usually is a 2 week wait for appointments. Any races out of the Middle East will be a minority there.

Positive: x-Ray on site, Peds, adult medicine, Arabic and Spanish translators (NO ASL), onsite lab, female medicine, and OBGYN.

The ONLY reason I keep going is because it's a one stop for my whole family's medical needs.<//Review>

Wouldn’t recommend to anyone this is by far the worst clinic ever, 2 girls who worked the desk who I later saw running through the halls giggling like it was recess at school couldn’t do their job correctly and were playing in the clinic, little to no technology at all, called about my bloodwork but apparently I have to wait 2 weeks for a follow up with my doctor to hear my results when I could just be told over the phone rather than going to this extremely unprofessional health clinic, this place should Ben shut down basically nobody but the doctors here speak proper English.<//Review>

The worst urgent care! I will never go back. Everything people are saying about this place is true. They are rude, employees (the men) standing around doing nothing except socializing. Waited an hr in lobby, I had to go to the desk to see if they forgot about me, after seeing people that came in 1/2 hr after me, getting called in! Girl at desk said they are going to call me in a few min. They did, but only to find out it was the wrong type of dr. I explained to the receptionist who I came to see, Dr Oda, but this person never came in, only the blood pressure nurse, who was VERY rude, acting as the go between for the dr! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, unless you're middle eastern, which, if you are, will have no problem getting seen...if I could give no stars, I would!</Text>

I visited this clinic, because I moved from another clinic was far from home. This clinic is the worst I've seen the clinic in the United States .. which does not have any privacy of the patient, the doctors do not care for the sick and not listening to the patient. I met with the doctor (Armando) did not allow me to tell him about patients when he said that you have the right to only one question .. !!! And then she made a complaint when Molina .. very very bad clinic ..</Text>

(Translated by Google) Quick attention, unfortunately they can never give references, they do not notify and if one is called the same they do not have inf until they expire and there is a need to request again. The first time I thought that I was the one who did not insist or I missed the information about the appointments, I returned and more than two months insisting and they said NOTHING that there was no answer until they call me from the specialist and they tell me their time to attend you IS ALREADY CANCELED because he never showed up.

(Original)
Atención rápida, desafortunadamente nunca pueden dar referencias, no avisan y si uno está  llamado igual no tiene inf hasta que se vencen y ay que solicitar de nuevo. La primera vez pensé que fui yo la que no insistí o me perdí la información de las citas, regreso y más de dos meses insistiendo y NADA decían que no había respuesta hasta que me llaman del especialista y me dicen YA SE CANCELO su tiempo para atenderle porque nunca se presentó.<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad service is supposed to be for care and do not even know that prescribing takes a long time for you to attend and does not take even 5 min in the room so they know well that you have not come out of what is a virus or bacteria is all When they don't know what you have, they send with the specialists and they don't even know what's wrong with you, especially with Dr. Olivera and the pediatricians who don't even want to see the children fast, I don't know what they are doing if they don't attend the what time did they give you

(Original)
mal servicio se supone que estan para cuidar y no saben ni si quiera  que recetarte tardan mucho para q t atiendan y  no tardan ni 5 min en el cuarto  para q  sepan bien q tienes  no salen de q es un pinche virus o una bacteria es todo y cuando no saben q tienes t mandan con los especialistas y ni ellos saben q te pasa q mal servicio especial mente con el doctor olivera y los pediatras q ni siquiera quieren ver a los niños rapido no se para q hacen cita si no t atienden a la hora q te dieron<//Text>< pics>

Absolutely my favourite dog park so far.  A smaller area for smaller dogs and a bigger are for bigger dogs,  both fenced.  We visited the bigger area.  There is a water station with fountains at different heights and a couple of poop bag stations too.  A nice paved path runs around the  large grassed middle play ground.  Outside the paved path, there is wood chip ground with many benches and picnic tables, some in the sun, some in the shade under the trees.  There are also about 10 agility stations dotted along the wood chip area, i.e. on the outskirts of the park.  As you can see in the pics, we visited on a dry sunny day.  Only met friendly people and dogs.  Our dogs said woof, woof - we'll go back for more!<//text>

<text>Beautiful park but filled with rude dog owners. They seem to think they own the park and can tell you how to handle your own dog. Not surprising given it’s in Novato. Definitely won’t be returning which sucks since the park itself is nice but people really ruin it.</text>< pictures>

Dogbone Meadow is a nice space. However, there are some issues you should be aware of. First, the drainage is horrendous. For years, in winters with heavy rains, a large lake would form at the dog park. When the city spent $600,000 on renovations a couple years ago, no one addressed the drainage issue (oops). Now whenever it rains, the city locks up the park and no one can use it. The second major issue involves some of the people and dogs that regularly come to the park. There is what I call the "4 o'clock crowd." There are a group of people who arrive en mass around 4pm each day who do not monitor their dogs nor do they clean up after them. The dogs often are rough and poorly mannered (like their human companions). If your dog can handle large, I'll-mannered dogs, fine. Otherwise, come at another time when it isn't raining.< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>This is where all the cool dogs hang out. Great concrete walk path. Plenty of space for big dogs and a large area for small dogs. Pick up bags provided on site with just a couple trashcan to use.

There are agility training blocks, tunnels, jumps, etc. Spread around the perimeter.

Water stations are available and kept clean.

The fence doors are broken which is the only bad thing about the park.< /Text>< gmapID>

Probably to be expected that I loved it because it's the first dog park I've really gotten into. Dogs and owners are amazing ly friendly and I didn't know about these places. I guess that's because now I have a grand dog who's the best little dog I know and bringing me into this doggy world. Go , and have a good time there!</text>

The renovations have made this a nice walking track for humans as the dogs romp and play. There's obstacles for training and fun as well and a fenced in area for smaller dogs with similar accommodations. Great water features here.< /Review>

Small dog run has a separate entrance and it's sizable too! Only downside is that the agility course is in the big dog run, so my small dog needs to manage the big dogs while keeping his concentration in his agility 😁< /review>

Found the dog park well planned, with double fence to safely bring pooches in and out. Baggies and water supplied. Nice lawn area and some agility equipment. Found owners following the rules, ie being attentive etc. Some shade provided by trees and bench with overhang area. Definitely will return.<//Review>

< Review>
This is a great park. Unfortunately there are people who never look up to watch their dogs. I picked up one corner and had 5 bags of big dog poop that no one seemed to notice. There was a lot more. If you are able to bring your dog to the park you should be able to pick up after them. If you can’t watch and have control over your dog, don’t bring them, or bring a helper or ask for help. If your dog is possibly a danger to another dog they do not belong in the park without a muzzle. If you are a dog walker you are being paid to walk the dogs, not bring them to a park where everyone else has to watch their dogs. At least come at a time when there are not a lot of dogs in the park.</Review>

<text>Great place in north Novato. Trails are well worn with lots of exploring for the dog. Nice big creek for dog to get a drink and cool off in. One of the paths leads to a fenced in large dog park. Dogs probably aren't allowed off-leash, but we go there just so our dog can run. .off-leash.<//text>< pictures>

I used to come here 10 years ago with my dog, who has since passed away, but recently moved back to the area with my new doggo and it's incredible how much this place has improved. There's a fully paved walkway that encircles a large grassy field which is surrounded by matured shade-giving trees, benches, tables and access to water for both the pups and their owners.
There is now plenty of room to walk your dog in front of parked vehicles instead of behind and they added an extra entry point so you don't need to walk in the parking lot for too long. They also seemed to have taken care of the drainage issues cause there were no puddles or mud holes.
Even the dogs all seemed better behaved, maybe because of the addition of a "relaxed" play area for older and also smaller dogs that would often times be ganged up on in the past.
I will definitely be back with my Frisco and probably bring a book/magazine to enjoy on one of the benches in the shade.</Text>

Great dog park with two water fountains for dogs, obstacle courses, and lush green grass. There's a small pathway around the grass for the humans</review>

Largest,  fenced dog park in the north bay area.  The people and dogs who come regularly are friendly and maintain a clean, comfortable public sp ace for socializing.  The city has plans to resurface and improve in the near future.< /Review>

<Text>Good size, provides waste bags, has fun tunnels and platforms and rings for the dogs to do tricks or just play on. Also has a gated smaller area. Friendly people and dogs. Also there are toys about for any dog to enjoy<//Text><rating>5<//rating><user_id>117676486381004900498<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x8085bbd0108bc253:0x4f5cb5b60cb787d</Gmap_id></record>

Great dog park, now that it's open. Too bad they didn't build in drains so the lawn wouldn't turn into a mud pit whenever it rains.<//Text>

<Text>This dog park could be amazing. It's so disappointing that after a several hundred thousand dollar renovation it is closed more than it's opened. I get so frustrated when I drive all the way there only to find the sign saying it's closed. This needs to be addressed!!!!!!!! What a waste of money. Can't even enjoy it!!!!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The banking schedule sucks. They closed earlier than other banks, 3 pm.  Parking in this area is a challenge.  But one positive note is they have a very helpful and accommodating  staff especially Erika. I give her 5 stars for customer service.<//Text>

<text>We closed our account at PNB Los Angeles on December 14, they didn’t give back the bank book but I asked a copy , the lady only provided a copy of the first page where it  shows the branch in the Philippines where we opened the account in 2018.
I checked the mail since Monday 12/27 until today the  29th, I see no check in the mail.  I checked the PNB website , shows permanently closed !!! No heads up received by email nor by mail. No reply to my email . An Edith  Manatad would  usually reply on the same day or the next day . What is going on? Have you guys experienced the  same ? Check your account now and see if it’s still there. I have been calling the PNB remittances and no one would pick up the call , I called all their remittance  branches to hear from them if they knew about the permanent closing of PNB Los Angeles At Wilshire Blvd.</text><name>Virginia Barnum<//name><Time>1609356709631<//Time>< gmapID>

Poor customer service. Very slow process. It takes months to open an account and it takes a month to close your own account. Too much fees yet service is very poor. Very backwards in delivering banking services.
I would put my money somewhere else!< /text>

<text>Well, its my first time dealing with PNB at Wilshire. They did a quick delivery of my mail check from my sss in the Philippines. Then i had an inquiry thru email they responded quickly. And am very satisfied the way they handled my transactions. Mabuhay.<//text><username>Rosalina Manio</username>< gmap_id>

In the past several years, my husband & I have been going to PNB LA branch (from their 2nd St ofc to now Wilshire) re our SSS pensions. All our visits had been fruitful and congenial because the personnel who attended to us were all respectful, helpful and patient. We have to give Ms. Erica D a big shoutout for being amiable and courteous all of the time.
(Btw, it is true that one needs to have rolls of patience if you decide to do business with PNB via phone. Better do personal visit instead). 🤗🌻</review>

Very disorganized, the supervisor/manager always uses a loud, demeaning voice. For a PNB (Philippine National Bank) branch in downtown LA, yet the place is too small to serve avid Filipino customers. How do you expect customer service to be great when it's obvious they don't take care of their own employees and brand here in America</review>

The phone number listed on the website is not working and should be updated. I called the ‘Other Concerns’ number and got through and answered promptly. The lady who took the call was very helpful and knowledgeable and answered all my questions without hesitation....< /review>

<Review>I wanted to give a zero but it won't allow me to. I guess, Filipinos need PNB no matter how bad the customer service to this branch is but I bet you it would be different if your someone they know. That's why we never advanced to the kind of life our neighboring countries are experiencing now. MY GOSH, WILL IT HURT YOU PEOPLE TO PICK UP THE PHONE OR RETURN A CALL OR AN EMAIL??? If it's too impossible for you to do these then put a notice saying NO MATTER HOW URGENT IT IS, WE NEVER EVER RETURN A CALL AND WE NEVER EVER RESPOND TO AN EMAIL...unless we know you or you're someone super duper important.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Isn't that their job? Incompetent in every way, and I've never been this irate with a company before. I've worked in customer service all of my life and this is worse I've ever encountered anywhere. If I was running PNB in the Philippines, I would be disappointed in how they're being represented here...but obviously they don't care since this bank has so many negative reviews.</Text>< rating>

<text>They help to resolve your bank documentation problem, it might have been better if the processing is not for 2 months which is a long wait.
I wonder why processing takes a long time, while electronic communication networking is now being practice by all banks.<//text>< pictures>

📍 pnb 🇵🇭 on wilshire blvd, los angeles ca 🇺🇸

🏦  located on bottom level #104 near coffee bean

⭐️ = 🔒  ring bell for staff to unlock 🔓 door

👎 = very small office

👎🏻 = 💲75 fee 🤬 to withdraw

👎🏼 = takes 2️⃣ ➕ weeks to get 💰 🤯

👎🏽 = instant coffee ☕️

📝  arrived few minutes after 9️⃣ am & tiny office was full.  left an hour later and it was empty.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>These people should inform the public that this facility is not an actual bank. I did not even see a vault. There are these ladies who are behind the windows, but I doubt if they can be called bank tellers. They mostly chat among themselves talking about the latest gossip they saw from The Filipino Channel,  amidst the line of customers  waiting at their mercy.  I really wonder how these employees work their whole day. They are physically present, but if you call the number listed on their website, no one answers the phone!!! Instead you are directed to someone's voiocemail  named "Lina".  If you don't want to answer the phone, then don't even list it on your website!!!</Text></record>

had to open a philippine peso account.I was worried knowing the fact that they're currently short with manpower BUT I am later on impressed with Ms ERIKA and Ms PINKY who showed so much patience and exerted their best efforts to accomodate my request the soonest possible. Thumbs up and clap clap to these ladies! Cheers for doing everything you can to assist everyones need! AND TAKE NOTE: YEP IT TAKES TIME TO REACH THEM THRU PHONE BUT NOT ONLY THEM NEEDS TO HAVE PATIENCE RIGHT?! GIVE THEM SOME TIME AND ONCE YOU GET HOLD OF THEM THEYRE NOT EVEN GONNA LET YOU HAVE THE LONG WAIT ON THE PHONE AGAIN THEY WILL BE THE ONE TO CALL YOU FROM TIME TO TIME TO KEEP YOU UPDATED WITH YOUR TRANSACTION☺️<//Text>

Customer service is very poor. And very rude, don't answer to any calls reasoning all the phone is not working. So you have choice but to go to the office PNB bank Los Angeles to ask questions then the person in charges at the left window is so rude, mayabang and talks and parinig sa customers na about what she just discussed with the other customer she just had argued with because she doesn't answer properly and politely sa customers. Malalayo oa pinanggalingan kc they never answer the phone for any questions you want to ask.</Review>

Worst bank ever.  Don’t ever bank with these people.  They pass the buck to another person when confronted with an issue.  Dealt with Pinky, Raquel and Rolf.  No customer service skills whatsoever!!!!!</text>

I was recently injured at work in December of 2020, I had felt neglected by my own company and thought I stood no chance but it wasn’t until I reached out to Oracle Law Firm. Karina and the whole staff was amazing  they were always available to answer questions even though they can be busy at times they will always return your phone call. I was surprised as to how quickly they helped settle my case and I am very happy with the outcome, thank you guys so much and I would recommend Oracle Law Firm to anyone in my situation, once again thank you! Very professional team.</text>

<review>I had an awesome experience with Oracle law firm. My case went very smoothly from the day I called the office until the end of my case and getting my settlement done.I didn't have the chance to meet any of this great team because of Covid-19. I definitely recommend this office for any injury case if you want the best that you can get. I want to thank all who answered my calls and give me a great confidence. You are the best.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

After searching for a lawfirm to help me with workers compensation,  I went with Oracle Law Firm and I am glad that I did. I just wished I hadn't waited so long. After having a bad experience with the company insurance. Thanks to my lawyer I received better treatment. In the end I am very  satisfied with the outcome, got me a reasonable compensation and the opportunity to achieve other goals in my life like going back to school. I definitely recommend this firm to anyone having any difficulties or issues. Also my paralegal Karina was very professional, helpful, informative and answered all my questions.<//text>

And when it concerns your employment, it can be scary. I’m glad that Oracle has handled my case, because I get my questions answered and my fears laid to rest. Stephanie is very responsive and when I let her know that I need to speak to my attorney, Jasmine Keogh, she will arrange a call quickly. Jasmine knows her stuff and gives me potential outcomes based on the law, not just to appease me. My case is going well and if I have another case that needs a firm like this, I won’t hesitate to call them.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< GmapID>

<review>I want to thank Stephanie Torres and the attorney Jasmine Keough for helping my mother out. Her case recently settled with more than we expected.

This company has helped me even though my previous attorney wasn't. When I transferred to The Oracle Law Firm, they began me with a new doctor and explained to me what the plan was. They walked me through everything and I am truly happy with what they accomplished for me. I am super happy that they were able to help me as fast as they did, because they were able to do so I am now able to get back to work and take care of my family. Thank you Oracle Law Group!!!!< /Text>

These guys have a very bad reputation and I would NOT recommend using these guys. There are a lot of good attorneys out there, and I actually just hired one to get me a lot of money with my case. These guys will sign you and then try to take all the money from you when you don't read the fine print. DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE GUYS!< /Review>

< Review>
I hired Oracle Law Firm after falling on a Big Budget film and was hurt and still hurt. My only issue is that I may have been unknowledgeable about where I could see a doctor as ALL of them refused me. I was overwhelmed with paperwork coming from the Workers Comp office and I was told that I didn't have to worry about that and the law office would handle it however I was not receiving medical treatment through workers comp and never got an answer on how to do so making me believe it was better to bare through the pain for the lawsuit and not charge up doctors bills. I was seeing my primary care doctor however those bills were not included in the case because I did not know any better.  I may have seen 4 doctors in 2 years and they were all doctors from the state.

Overall I know 1000% that my case was worth more than I received (I guess I should have called the office and asked more questions everyday being a pain in the butt for 2 years) however,  Suzy, the last Paralegal on my case, was very professional and caring in answering my questions and helping me after the case closed in getting at least what I thought I was agreeing to.

I think this is a great, reputable firm however be proactive in your case or you will lose out on money that should be for you to live more comfortable due to your accident! Do not sign anything without making sure you everything that is stated on the phone is either recorded or in print. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, I believe my case did not receive the attention that it should have nor were the medical records obtained as they should have been but I was afraid to not settle. Never settle anything in a rush!!!

I learned a lesson! Even when you hire a firm you still have to ask questions, demand care and make sure you speak with your paralegal and lawyer about everything involved in the case and make sure ALL of your complaints were taken care of and you visited ALL of the specialists that were ordered before you settle a case. I never saw a neurologist which was ordered and my nervous system is tremendously affected since then and part of that is not being able to focus and organize and understand what was happening. Once you settle there is nothing you can do about it except realize that you got royally screwed!

Hopefully this never happens again as this type of pain and the pain I will have for life as a result is not worth the settlement but if it did I would go back to Oracle but I would know to go to the doctor when I am in pain, don't force myself to go to work when I can barely breath from chest bruising for 3 months and report and record everything! If you do all of  the back end work yourself I think they will do the work in court but you will have to pay attention!! This is my first workers comp case so I don't have another firm to compare it to. I will refer them to family or friends and maybe they can be taken care of fairly knowing what I know now.</Review>

< Review>
I hired another firm to help me with my case.  But they were terrible at responding to me.  I would call Nd leave voicemails.  I would email. I just got really fed up.  I found Oracle and Attorney Reza on the internet.  Their reviews were great. Their clients expressed they were happy with Oracle's services.  I decided to give them a shot and it turned out to be one my best decisions!

Oracle treated me like I was their only client. They gave me the attention and RESPECT that I deserved. They explained the process and were completely responsive.  They are really hardworking and it showed with my great settlement!! Thank you Oracle! GOD BLESS!</Review>

My case manager was Marina ,she was very nice and helped me through my case process .<//Text>

<review>Professionalism at its finest.

The Oracle Law Firm and Mr. Reza put their client's interests first with efficient and thorough attention to detail to negotiate and achieve the best settlement for the client. They are as transparent as you can get - which is a refreshing characteristic when it comes to the confusing world of law. As a bonus, their friendliness and dedication is beyond compare and really makes any interaction as pleasurable as it can get.

If you need someone on your side I can not recommend them enough.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1563984866978, 'text': 'Harrison, thank you for the amazing review! It was a pleasure to work with you too.'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

I am so glad I made the switch my old Attorney was not doing much for me so I was referred to Oracle Law Firm by a friend and they have taken good care of me. Every time I call the staff is very helpful they are able to answer all my questions and are very knowledgeable unlike at other places. The Attorneys really care for you and are very friendly but are also direct which I expect nothing less in my case. I would definitely keep referring my friends and family to this firm.<//review>

I have rarely come across a law firm as attentive as Oracle.  Their attention to the details of the case is remarkable.  You can tell they care about your well being and getting you the best result on your case.  It is also very helpful that their staff is so knowledgable and friendly.

Thank you Oracle Law Firm for your superior service and professionalism!<//review>

I cannot recommend the Oracle firm enough. I was referred to their team by a trusted friend who closed a case with them. Mr. Ghamari is friendly, professional, and most importantly upfront about what to expect in my personal case.  I retained them immediately after our first call, and was so impressed with how easy they were to deal with from start to finish. I've dealt with a lot of lawyers, and it makes me happy to know I finally found a team I can trust and will fight for my cases and best interests.< /text>

I'm an attorney myself and I send my family and friends to Oracle.  I've recieved nothing but praise from all the clients that I've referred to them over the years.  Their dedication to their clients and profession is unmatched.  You can't find a better group of attorneys to handle your workers compensation and employment cases.<//review>

<Review>At first everything was going well. Up until the Deposition everything change. I feel as if I was in a hurry to make a  decision. My  attorney  look like he didn’t want to be there and just get over with it. He didn’t give me any feed back but to settle. I really thought oracle was going to fight for me. Never again will I trust them. Or recommend them. It’s sad cause I really didn’t know anything. I feel as I made the wrong choice. But it is what it is.<//Review>< user_id>

I will say I appreciated them taking on my WC appeal.  However, once settlement talk seriously began and we were reaching the end,  I began to feel rushed.  End result after almost 1 year:  an agreement that left me nowhere close to whole, jobless, and without any future medical. I was encouraged by the Oracle attorney to sign as it was the best one could hope for.  Hindsight makes me think otherwise especially when I weigh in a few mistakes made along the way that should've never happened.  In fact, I brought them to their attention so I wonder about the firm's checks and balances. With it all over, I'm left with just a feeling of "being on the fence" with regard to my personal interactions with Oracle. Would I recommend them to friends/family? Probably not. Would I go out of my way to discourage one who had chosen them? No.  Good luck.</Text>

<Text>On Behalf of David Atencio,

I am incredibly thankful to Oracle Law firm for assisting in my Workers Compensation case. I suffered a horrific accident and they worked their hardest to help me get back on my feet. I was able to get my two daughters through prestigious universities as a single father. Oracle is the right firm, please take my word that these folks will advocate for you beyond the standard that you expect, with hearts that are truly in it. I am very blessed to have them serve me in the manner that they have. Biggest thanks from the bottom of my heart to Fred Ghamari, Maria Rodriguez, Julian Solis, Maria Avila, and Robert Torres.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I had a fall last year at work and was getting no where with my boss. Literally in agonizing pain for weeks. The people at Oracle really helped me out with everything. I got my claim setup and received the treatment I was  needing. The staff is really friendly and efficient. Highly recommend to anyone in the same situation I was in.< /Review>< resp>

I can’t express enough how thankful I am to Oracle Personal Injury Law Firm! Right from the very beginning the entire team was very helpful and knowledgeable.

I was sent to the best doctors and someone was always available too assist me. There were so many times I called or may have been an annoying client because I was under so much stress and having emotional breakdowns feelings of being overwhelmed because bills were due or sometime I felt the case was moving too slow for me.
This  team never turned their back on me and always reassured me that everything was okay.
They also explained each process too me from beginning to end.
Last but not least they got me the settlement I deserved!
I will definitely recommend Oracle Personal Injury Law Firm.

Thank you again! Oracle Law Firm

<text>What can I say about Oracle Law Firm? MANY THINGS! They are honestly the best Lawfirm I've ever gone through. It was my first time getting injured in a work place environment. Of course my old job didn't want to take responsibility and just let me go thinking I dont know any better since I am young but they were wrong! Luckily I did my research and found Oracle Law and right away they helped me tremendously! They kept me updated on my case, they talked to my ex employer when I didn't want to, and they fought for me/believed in me! Because of the hard working people at Oracle Law Firm I won my case and won a settlement! Thank you again to everyone at Oracle Law Firm that helped me with my case. I will most definitely choose Oracle Law Firm again!</text></record>

Thank you Oracle and Mr. Reza for taking care of me when I needed help. The insurance company was completely ignoring me and trying to close out my claim. Mr. Reza took charge, got me great medical attention and negotiated a great settlement. Thank you so much. I recommend Oracle to anyone who needs good legal counsel.<//review>

Oracle Law firm and Mr. Reza are bar none the best worker's compensation firm/lawyers west of the Mississippi. All jokes aside, I send them all of my worker's compensation clients who I value dearly and they have always come back with high praise.

Thank you, Oracle!< /review>

<Text>We were on a long 5 hr road trip with no air conditioning and it was very windy the whole way. We saw this lake on the way to Lone Pine, and flipped a u turn to go check it out. Glad we did! Nice little lake/camping ground. We all put on our bathing suits and jumped in! The water was perfect. It cooled us down so we weren't all grumpy any more! This lake had nice picnic benches, a small swimming beach, I didn't see a bathroom..but I didn't look too hard. There is a playground, and the views of the mountains are amazing.< /Text>< user>

Looked like a nice place to walk the dog around the lake, but not so.  Kinda run down and the bathroom doors were locked.  Walked partway around the lake till we hit a locked gate that wasn't on the map.  Homeless people living in a van.< /text>

However for a memorable fun family summer experience. Then my rating is exactly correct. It's a great place with both water camping and traditional park toys experience. It offers many various style sites and lake views. The grounds are ALWAYS clean and the restrooms will kept and stocked with paper. The wildlife experience and sites are definitely magical.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpnBDqOljBr_zOEzq2cbKxvd-aO6i4uV33jWIP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGUzFGxfic_utkFA6NWogm8D4LDS6iFZdKtPiz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSlF2NizZOGO90HLI7DrelNLO7RXSEVJKLdrIP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2eahpfAJ8ia1f60IuwfRGP3wy-A6TcsM_oU_q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5cSjn-d3a0V-UTefUK1xwDT_1EBw7UQxdhBDN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

< review>
When camping there April 22nd through 28th 2019. The campground is very rustic and I had made reservations at a random site not knowing where I was going to Camp. After getting up there and looking around I found the gem of all campsites there it's number 44. There are numerous trees plenty of shade as well as your own Cove to fish from whenever you want as well as Wade In The Water. Now you do have to park about 30 feet from where you set up camp but it is well worth the walk. When we went the water was supposed to be on but the entire part did not have water due to maintenance. The bathrooms are about a hundred and fifty yard walk from where we were camping although the trade-off for the site we were at was well worth it.</review>

A very nice, picturesque pond in the shadows of the Sierras escarpment. My friend Patty and her son Robert used to camp and fish here. It was their favorite lake. I believe Robert spred Patty's ashes nearby. A fitting tribute.< /Review>

this is the first time here.   you can hear and see the highway which is not pleasant. 14.00 a night. they had a sign that states " no potable water at this time" because it is winter time and pipes freeze. dfg still stocks during winter and fishing was good on our trip. open year round.</text>

<user_name>Madeline Burritt<//user_name><response>None< /response><text>Stayed here last year and had a good experience. Not the same this time! Lake is super gross and all the water spigots are capped so no running water what so ever. Had already payed for the night when we found this out. Trash and liter all over the campground. Bathrooms stink and appear filthy. I would never come here again and I would not recommend staying here.<//text><rate>1</rate>< gmapID>

There is no campground this location !! Phone number on this list is Diaz Lake Campground at Lone Pine. Do not try to go this location. Nothing there and wasting your time. I found this information when I was at Keough hot springs and trying to find campground near me.</Text>

(Translated by Google) If you want to relax surrounded by nature overlooking a calm lake, you must visit Diaz Lake. Alone or with the family you can spend a pleasant day. It is located in Lone Pine - California. You can stay a day or several days and enjoy. You can bring your authorized boat or boat. Ample parking, clean and tidy.

Outstanding spot for delicious Persian food. Nice place to relax, people watch, eat good, etc.  This place has an awesome feel to it. Food is similar to a cafe in Portland I loved.<//Text>

< review>
Fantastic lamb kabob plate!  Small restaurant, super helpful staff and we definitely liked the outside seating. They have an extensive menu that’s worth asking about if you stop in. This restaurant is close to a lot of nice places to stop in and check out.  Highly recommend.<//review>

<Review>This restaurant is managed by the Nowroozi family. They are quite nice and friendly. The food quality is the best from natural and fresh ingredients. They offer varieties of Kabob and Stews. You can pick kabobs in different format like in wrap, with rice and salad, or with spring salad.
The taste of the food are amazing and it has already the required sides. Thus, you don't need to pay extra for the sides. It is the best place to have a quick but healthy and delicious food during your working days. I usually call Naseem for pre-ordering whenever I start walking to that restaurant. When I arrived there, my yummy meal is ready on the table! As a result, I can come back to my work very quickly with lots of energy.
Friday is the day for treating myself with Naseem's baking and pastries. Their Persian style hot tea along with Naseem's Cream Puff is the best combination for refreshing yourselves during afternoon.
Thank you Nowroozi family for establishing such a successful restaurant.</Review>< pictures>

If you want good Persian food this is the place. It might be a little crowded during lunch (12 to 1) but that is the price to pay for good quality food.  Staff is very polite and decorations are nice. No bathroom though.<//Text>

At first I thought it was a tiny cheap place walking up. Boy was I wrong, its is a super cozy with a great atmosphere early morning. The food is awesome too, we got the omelette and European toast and none of it was greasy.  10/10 would come again.</Text>

This place is right opposite my office, so invariably I end up eating here every now and then. However, this is the only place in that shopping compound that I eat at, simply because the food is really good. The hostess and her mother are really warm people and every time you visit, you feel welcomed.  Their coffee is equally good and mostly anything on their menu can hardly go wrong :)<//review>

<review>I have always gone out of my way to come here. I highly recommend eating anything at Naseem's. I always have the chicken kebab plate, falafel sandwich and ask for a tubuleah salad. Next time I need to get a stew.
You will not be disappointed. The bread for the wraps in INSANE.< /review><Time>1559091322698<//Time>< user_id>

The food could be more flavorful. Found it a little lacking in taste. I had the tofu kebab it was dry and not juicy. I ordered for office folks they messed up the order as I asked for house sauce instead of the grilled tomato. Despite talking on the phone several times and sending detailed email. My co-workers who had meat also said it was dry.</Text>

Ordered a kabob plate to go with yellow sauce on the side.

Four small pieces of chicken played on top of a metric ton of rice. No pita bread.

11.99 for the above, plus a 1.00 for a side of sauce that tastes like hidden valley ranch with a hint of food coloring.

Much better options out there for the price.<//Text>

The price on Uber-eats was a little higher than our restaurant due to their cost.  We have changed it to the same pricing as we offer on our website now. The chicken kabob is $9.99 and the yellow color of the sauce is from the mustard.  You can order the pita bread for $0.50.  Looking forward to your uber-eats orders.\nThanks\nNaseem'}< /response></record>

We spent a lunch meal with family here on Saturday. The staff were friendly and helpful. However the good quality was quite poor. I ordered lamb kebab with rice. It was the worst lamb kebab i ever had and as I am Persian myself i was expecting for a better quality. I believe the previous reviews are not quite genuine . The portion of the food was also very small.</Text>

The service is exemplary!  The owner went way above and beyond the call of duty to ensure our order was completed in a timely manner, and the food was gobbled right up.  Highly recommend and can't say enough good things about Naseem's Bakery and Kabob!<//Text>

Love this place a lot... A nice small cafe... Great coffee and selection... As well good food...

If you like Mediterranean food, you should check out this place... Their Paninis and grilled platters are really good...

I love the place for its ambience, soft music and amazing service from really amicable people...

Should check out their grilled lamb or chicken plate... Their Paninis are also worth the checkout... Their coffee selection are a must try... Hot chocolate, Mocha and latte are my favorite...< /review>

Very popular among Qualcommers, and it gets super busy during Lunch weekday.

Nice atmosphere and they have starters, salads, stews, Kabob Plates & Wraps, Skewers, Sandwiches and also great Coffee.

Highs:
Nice friendly service
Delicious lamb kabobs
Nice roasted eggplants
Grilled platters

Lows:
Beef Kababs could be more Juicy
Paking, around 15 business and have around 15 spots, Heh?< /Review>

This is the spot! Try it. You wont regret it. I'd driven by this spot for 2 years and had been constantly teased by the smell. I finally stopped by and now i will continue to visit in the future. Highly recommended.

Little bacon breakfast burrito. Big flavor! I add sour cream and grilled onion. Definitely a favorite. Cheap prices, canned beverages. What's not to love?<//review>

This place has great food, great prices, big burritos and some of the stuff you get a free can of soda with. Colima burrito is perfect if you're hungry plus got a nice collaboration of greatness inside, oh yeah and a free can of soda.< /Review>

If you have any food allergies dont go here, I'm allergic to beans, yes yes I know beans are a staple food at Mexican restaurants ,however I am super allergic and I always order all rice . Well today I ordered my meal, got back to theoffice and started to eat my food only to find out that who ever made my plate put beans by accident and instead of making a new plate they scrapped them out and covered them up with rice  rather than make a new plate. For someone with severe allergies this was not cool at all.Thanks for making me incredibly sick just to save a few bucks . I bought lunch here about twice a week for the past two years and would have continued to do so for the next 20 years but now will take my business elsewhere.< /review>

First time here it was taco tuesday 99cent mini tacos I got al pastor and Carne asada. Also a side of fries for my toddler. Everything was so so so good. Been looking for a new taco spot and this is officially it. I cant wait to come back and try other things on the menu. Definitely recommend it's a little place you almost miss it if your driving by. It's right next to (behind) the gas station in front of the laundry mat.<//Text>

Today I ordered my food drive-thru section. When cashier charge me for my order I could hear the young cook with glasses wearing all white talking profanity about my order. Everyone inside establishment all young people with no adult in charge. Cook still got my order wrong once I got home.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>This is one of those places that takes you back in time. It looks like it has seen better days,but the food is delicious, plentiful,and CHEAP! Try their plain cheeseburger special. It is a 1/4 lb. Burger with American cheese on a buttered,grilled bun,and nothing else. It comes with a good portion of steak fries,and you get it all for $2.40! Plus,if you walk up to order,you are served complimentary chips with salsa. Hot salsa!</Text>< pictures>

Excellent pricing and food.  The dining is limited to outdoors only, and they have no restroom.  Patrons will have to hold it or hope they can use the facilities at the adjacent gas station.  The last time I attempted to use their restroom, I was told that it was out of order.   Hmmm ...< /review>

<review>10 years later STILL my favorite place to get a wet burrito!! BONUS: They give you free chips and salsa when you eat-in! The salsa is the best, so simple and flavorful. Never had any problems with quality of food. Always excellent customer service from the employees.

Love love love this place me and my family here at least once a week it has been our spot for years but only have a few great but they always have deals and the prices are fair they used to be cash only now they accept ATM and it just made it much better. They also recently updated all the lighting gives it a good modern look I've been looking for some great Mexican food come here and try the Colima burrito or the ground beef hard shell tacos<//text>

For $2.50,you get a 1/4lb burger w/cheese on a grilled bun-no veggies,and an order of thick-cut steak fries. Or,for $3.75 you get the deluxe burger-w/lettuce,tomato,onion,and dressing,with a larger order of their steak fries and comes with a cold drink ! You cant beat this deal anywhere!< /Text></record>

Their food signs attracted my attention to the place and thought I would try it. Omg, the food was so surprisingly delicious. Especially the shrimp cocktail which I would never think a lil hole in the wall place would have such good food.<//Review>

We like to go cause we know it's always Great food and really good prices... I love their sopes deal you get two sopes rice and beans for less than $6. The only bad thing of this place is CASH ONLY!!! They give you chips and salsa to go if you order more than 15 or 20 can't remember. It's a small place but can't beat the prices and quality of food.

I ordered a carne asada burrito and added carnitas which they charged an extra $1.99 plus tax. Then added pico de gallo. Well my carne asada burrito had none no carne asada at all and no pico. Although a very delicious carnitas burrito in red sauce it was not what I ordered and paid extra for.The horchata is a bit bland. Maybe just needed to be stirred? Affordable drink refills as well.</Text>

<review>This place is amazing. Completely off the beaten track and the best bean and cheese burritos ever. I use to live near here but even after I moved I would make the trip all the way here for tacos burritos and basically everything. Worth the stop if you're going from LA to Riverside. Just exit Jurupa.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<text>Outside seating. Food is ok. Small take out place. People say they give you big portions. I don't think so. It's pretty much what u pay what u get. No customer service at all. Order, give money n thank u. While u r seating either waiting for food or eating. On your both side cars are coming for drive through. In mean Time you are inhaling car fumes seating in their patio. Thank God I'm a smoker so smog has little effect on me. Good luck non smokers .< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcb45b4ac75b59:0xebb0b9b31df2f3fe< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY AMAZING 👍🙌👍🙌👍🙌👍🙌  I'm upset because it took me so long to try this place and now I'm addicted. Food Is sooooo flavorful as well as the salsa. I have a 4 year picky eater and he ate most of my chips and salsa 😂😂😂. Service is great!!!! I mean what more can I say??? O ya call ahead 10 mins because they get packed but TRUST ME its worth the wait!

<Text>We go here often, however today we went and ordered 2 breakfast burritos with beans they only charged us for 1 burrito with beans and it was half the size we usually get. the lady's there were very rude and when we called them they basically said it was our fault the lady taking the order didn't hear us when we asked for a manager or owner she said he can call us if he feels like it. All in all a very bad experience and won't be going here for a while<//Text>< response>

They have a colima burrito that has multiple meats thats excellent! I always ask for it wet with green sauce. I however do not like thier hard shell tacos.

Not beverage included on the menu but you can eat a big plate of combinated thai food for around $6. I found it cheap, tasty and with nice staff.< /Text>

I love this spot! They prepare high quality meals, they have a nice menu, The chief cook in that restaurant is very trained, I like very much trying all their dishes. The food is always fresh, the service towards the visitors  is very good too. I frequently visit this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied.  I highly recommend it.< /Review>

<review>Have eaten here many times since my last review, including lunch today. Food has gotten much better and prices remain reasonable. Had the "Special Won Ton" soup today and was blown away. For $7.95 got large bowl that had beef, chicken, shrimp, won tons and LOTS of veggies. Almost more than I could eat. GREAT SOUP. Will continue to eat here when the occasion arises. No wonder half the construction folks eat lunch here. Highly recommended.<//review>< rating>

<rating>3</rating><review>Great, cheap, and tasty fast-food style Chinese food.  I was so sad when they were closed.  But they are back and just as good!  I love their overwhelming helpings for a great price.  My go-tos are the jalapeno fish and teriyaki chicken with chow mein.  The chow mein is a thicker noodle with cabbage and I personally enjoy it more than Panda's.</review>< pics>

We came in to eat this morning while visiting the Farmer's market. Let me start off by saying this place is soooo clean! We ordered the sizzling rice soup, chaam ppong noodles, egg rolls and pork fried rice.  Chinese food can be super greasy, but the food was not that greasy.  The food tasted really clean and delicious :)  I am glad there is a new addition to our community that we can enjoy!< /Review>

<Review>OMG this food is delicious we ordered shrimp chow mein, beef and broccoli, beef fried rice, tangerine chicken, and a side order of white rice.

I had my food delivered and they said it would take 45 minutes let me tell you it only took 25.
The driver was super nice and friendly and our late lunch almost dinner was the best try it you will not regret it.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><user>104054173959102143749< /user>< Gmap_id>

Was very impressed with Maxim Chinese Food.  Have had it a few times now. The delivery times varies from 15 minutes to an 1 hour but the food always arrives hot.  The portions are large and well prepared.  Ordering through the web is a great feature.</text>

Ordered from here about 3 times now. Maxim Chinese Food, relatively high quality Chinese food! Quick delivery. :) Super convenient,

There was a small mistake with my 3rd order, but not a big deal.

Will definitely order from Maxim Chinese Food again!< /Text>

This place is B.O.M.B! I would say this place is a mix of Korean, Taiwanese and Thai dessert? We came here around 9pm and this place is packed! there was a line to be seated. This isn't really a order and eat on the go kind of dessert place, so take a moment, get seated and enjoy to freshly served desserts here.</review>

This has always been a go to whenever I'm back in the city. Even with COVID restrictions, their delivery is high quality. Chicken stays warm and crispy! Dry fried dry chicken wings are the way to go. Definitely on par with Bon Chon.<//Review>

This place was a pleasant surprise. Definitely a hole in the wall type of place but much to my surprise the food was very tasty and not overly greasy. The beef pancake was the most surprising. When they brought it out I thought I would avoid it, but I decided to take a chance and it wasn't greasy at all and the filling was quite light and fresh tasting. Definitely a place I'll preference in the future when I want easy Chinese food.< /text>

We have found this to be a really amazing place to take out of town guests with varying levels of Chinese food familiarity!  Not only is the food delicious and the staff helpful, but it is quiet enough to hold a converstation with your table. This is where we eat when it is just the two of us, or when family is in town.<//Review>

< Review>
To be avoided at all costs! Food was inedible and had to be trashed. At least a day old and had an off taste. The so-called 'chicken' was nothing of the sort. What it actually was is anyone's guess. Complete waste of money. Reported to the Dept of Health.< /Review>

The food was okay at best, beef and broccoli and chicken with peppers. They clearly didn't wash the food well enough, I had two rocks that I bit down on before I threw the food in the trash. There is very little more terrifying than biting down hard on to something that makes you believe that you've broken a tooth. Really disppointing, won't return.<//review>

<review>Always great to get lunch or dinner from Maxim Chinese Food! I've worked and/or lived relatively close for 8 years and it is my go-to for General Tso Chicken and miso soup. I've turned several friends and family members into fans as well.< /review>< time>

Great fishing location, caught lots of bluegill using red worms on really small hooks. Cast near the tullies with a weight on the end. Fish were biting best at dusk. Easy access, we fished not too far from the dock along the trail. Just make sure to bring plenty of water & sunscreen for those hot days!<//review>

We came here to swim. We checked the website first and we did not find anything that mentioned swimming, or the prohibition thereof. We got to the docks and there are "No Swimming" signs. We were about to hop into the water anyway, when a local warned us of doing so since the rangers love to fine swimmers and patrol frequently.<//Review>

Nice spot for a day of fishing, picnicking, or boating. Good launch site for a small fee. No swimming however. Watch for rattlesnakes and poison oak in the spring, summer, and early fall.</Review>

First you need to know that this is a no contact lake so you can't get in the water but the dock is perfect for launching our little boat and crewzing around for a while!</review>

Very clean and nice shop, pretty big. Went for Magic the Gathering singles and David was very knowledgeable and helpful. Would visit the shop again even though it is quite a drive for me. Good prices and friendly people.<//Review>

I placed an order for 3 comics on 12/29/19 and as of this review on 02/09/20 I only received 2 of them. Same story every time, it was damaged in transport and we had to reorder. Today while picking up my number two comic, the clerk stood in a corner for 20 minutes texting while three others in the room setup their card games sets. I'm going to Graham Crackers off of Madison from now on. Update, still do not have my last and final comic. Was also confronted by store manager and am very displeased with their level of service.</Review>< userid>

Best place in California for you gaming, magic, and comic book needs. The facilities are huge and well organized. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The staff and the owners make you feel welcomed and at home. The community that plays there is fun and welcoming. Best of all, the prices are all very low and competitive for high quality product. Once you go to SoCal, you won't want to go anywhere else.</Text>

This place was great with awesome and helpful staff and community. My girlfriend got me into MTG and we stopped in here to build decks and people were very helpful and knowledgeable. They also have a selection of Warhammer, DnD, board games and comics that will definitely keep me coming back.<//Review>

Super friendly people and Very helpful! Not at all like the Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons. Sean took time to show our kids how to play Pokemon. The regulars are also very nice,  and there is a cool family friendly vibe that you don't always get at comic book shops.<//Text>

The staff goes out of their way to make each and every customer feel like they are part of the family. If they don't have it on the shelves, and they are unable to order it for you, than they'll point you in the right direction to get you taken care of. That's why I maintain a subscription to a comic that I don't even read anymore with them just because I want to support them.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>SoCal Games and Comics is the epitome of "your Friendly Local Game Store (FLGS)".  I mostly attend RPG nights with my daughter, but have also purchased comics and minis from here.

Staff is attentive, environment clean, and store layout conducive to browsing your interests without getting in the way of others.  For folks who are new to the various hobbies, the staff are great ambassadors, getting folks pointed in the right direction, offering tips, and introducing them to others who share the same interests.

I see regular Magic tournaments, special RPG events, and even comic author/artist signings (their social media presence is updated regularly).

The environment is family-friendly, and disruptive boisterous activity is kept to a minimum, while still enabling everyone to enjoy their hobbies.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Staff was snide when regarding the back issues I was looking for, incapable of speaking in anything but an "um, sweetie" uptalk.  Then failed to find what I was looking for and tried to pass a graphic novel off as the same thing.
Then they chastised a regular customer in front of me for not picking up his ordered comics, which he was there to pick up.
Then they rang up the customer behind me because she worked in the area and they were buddies.
I went in looking to spend a fair amount of money and possibly bring in my D&D group and instead I was treated like a hassle, rushed out, and will caution others to avoid this place.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
I heard that SoCal was opening up so quickly after the other local gaming shop (Thou Shalt Game) was closing. Which was a staple in the local gaming community, but I can say this was a much needed change.
SoCal Games and Comics is much better on every level. Customer service and aesthetically.
Aesthetically the place is super spacious, clean, and doesn't smell bad at all (incredil rare for a "gaming shop"). The high ceilings make it feel less cramped, they have great climate control so it doesn't feel like a muggy nerd swamp. The shop is incredibly organized wall to wall. They have an incredibly huge comic book/ comic trade selection, as well as a huge selection of board games and hobby games to choose from. I especially like that they have a lot of games you can demo with staff or other resident players (who seemed more than happy and nice enough to teach someone to play) before you decide whether you may want to purchase or buy into said game.
The staff at SoCal are nothing but nice. They did not have a product I was looking for, and they went out of their way to bring up the product from their sister store (Sky High Comics in San Marcos), so I could have what I was looking for the next day. Thank you for that!

I definitely recommend checking out SoCal for anything table top gaming and comic book related!< /Review>

Yeah, I'm never going to shop here.

I went into SoCal Games and Comics to promote an event which greatly appeals to their customer demographic. I was waiting in line to ask the woman behind the register if I could leave some flyers for my event on the front counter. The customers in line before me seemed like they'd be interested in my event, so I began to tell them about it... when "Ms. Thing" behind the counter (presumably the proprietor) rudely interrupted me by saying, "Um, could you NOT do that inside my store?!" I tried multiple times to politely explain my position to her, but she failed to drop her negative, hostile attitude. Yes, I realize I may have been slightly out of line, forward even, in my actions, but I've NEVER had a store manager give me such unwarranted attitude when promoting my events elsewhere. Before enduring her mistreatment, I had planned to purchase some choice collectables there at SCG&C, but I was so hurt by her words, I changed my mind. Not only would I have spent a significant amount of  my hard-earned cash at SCG&C that day, but this review would have been positive and helpful to this establishment.  In fact, I went to the GameStop right around the corner and spent the money there instead.

A word of advice "Girly": maybe use a bit more tact and diplomacy when dealing with your customers?

Oh, and another thing: tattoos are trashy... especially on females.<//Text>

{'time': 1557360757255, 'text': "Hello. Rachel Parker here, Store Manager.\nSorry but there is so much untrue about this situation it's amazing. You came, set your flyers down on my counter without asking me. I then asked YOU what these flyers were for. You explained and I then let you know you COULD leave them, which you did. I had plenty of people pick them up. What I did not approve of was you trying to sell tickets to this event and taking payment in front of my register. I believe any small business would disapprove of that. For the record. Tons of people picked up these flyers and we did talk about your event. We also work closely with another business in the area to promote their weekly video game tournaments. You're welcome for the additional exposure but I'm sorry to say we cannot partner again.\n\nAlso. My boyfriend LOVES my tattoos. Not that I needed to explain that part of my life to you."}< /Resp>

Had at least 100-150$ worth of Pokémon ex card I brought in. Most of them were pretty rare it’s was a pretty large stack of cards and they gave me 15$ for it. I mean come on one card from that stack was worth 15$ I was such in need of the money I had to sell them. Totally regret it. Highly don’t recommend selling anything to them, they will rip you off<//Text>

<Text>I finally found it. Is in Temecula the same shopping center where Costco and the mall is at passing Petco. I'm glad I found it.

I walked in and I couldn't find what I was looking for and do you know why? Everything is in alphatical order which is great don't get me wrong.

I also loved the fact that they had 2 restrooms, and a baby diaper station.

Rachel the store manager guide me through where the single issues were, the trade paperback, mangas, and even collectibles.

They have snacks, drinks and the best part is the mobile app. At first I did not know how to use. Rachel took the time to show me how it works and how to order many books from the comfort of my home. Thank you Rachel!

My experience has been great. I pick up my books from my pull list and the staff is amazing, they don't know me by name yet, but soon they will know me. SolCal Comics keeps the loyal customer very happy. My pull list keeps saying "feed me more." Look no further, go to SolCal Comics.

Este lugar tiene todo lo que te puedes imaginar. Tiene para cambiar los pañales de tus bebés, tiene todo en orden, tiene bebidas, juzgerias(snacks), Rachel y el equipo te dejará bien contento. No busques más ven aquí y disfruta de SolCal Comics.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The owner and staff were very friendly, and willing to answer questions when I first came in. They didn't have the games I was looking for but offered to special order them for me. After telling me they would arrive in 3 days, I showed up only to be told that they weren't in and nobody had bothered to let me know. They gave me a new arrival date. I again showed up at the shop to find the games not there. The next date they gave me, I called ahead to make sure they had arrived. I was told they did, so I drove to the shop, they weren't there. The next day they called to let me know they had arrived, I drove to the store again and only 2 of my 3 games had arrived (2 weeks after I placed the order).

By this time I had left multiple phone messages and in-person messages with employees asking to speak to the owner. None were returned, and none of the employees could even give me a date when my third game would arrive. Nearly 3 weeks after my initial order, I finally showed up and happened to find the owner. Only then did he let me know that the game was back ordered, meaning that every one of the arrival dates I was given was simply made up by whatever employee I was talking to.

I really wanted to like this shop, but the lack of organization and communication made it very frustrating to do business with them. Even asking an employee to look up my order entailed a 10 minute wait while they typed a full novel into the computer.<//Review>

seemed like a nice place but the lady with the short pink hair was super rude, my mom was gonna ask her something and she yelled out “you need to look at me when you talked to me” and called my mom rude. maybe it was a misunderstanding but she definitely came off super rude<//Text>

<Text>I moved to Temecula from San Diego and I can honestly say it's tough finding a place that sells magic singles let alone provides friendly customer service. I can't believe someone else rated this a one. The store owner not only answered all my questions for quite a while he also answered many of them two hours past closing and played my friend a game of street fighter. The customers who shop there all seemed to know each other and there was a free magic rules guide and spider man sketchbook for customers. A++< /Text>< pictures>

Most of the staff are friendly. They have a good choice of board games RPGs figurines and paints. Except for one staff member who constantly nags and complains, about a DND table I belong to I would have given a 5-star rating. Finally had enough and we left the store for a local gaming store that just opened its doors don't plan on spending my money there anymore.<//Review>

<Review>I think this store is new, but it isn't very clean. There's slot of different games, comics, and stock, but it is a bit disorganized. Lots of gaming tables. Staff seem nice but inexperienced. I had some cards stolen while I was there, and staff couldn't/wouldn't help. Attempted to order two items at different visits, and both times the staff I spoke too didn't know how to take my order. They wrote down my name and phone number, but no one has called me back (three weeks running - I guess they are too busy).<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80db7e3fc5c521e3:0xd197b96406da1933< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place offers a nice atmosphere and helpful staff that can answer any of your MTG questions. However, these guys are generally at the higher end of the spectrum when it comes to card prices. They do offer discounts for "loved" cards which is nice. If you want a nice smelling, clean place, with plenty of tables to play mtg (or other games) TSG cannot be beat! The only thing that could make it better would be the addition of a mini bar :)

Edit:
They also offer free prize support when big EDH games get going! Not to shabby!<//text>

More games than comics, but still has current issues and games galore.

Update:  Not the friendliest staff all the time, went in to get a refund from something I ordered 3 weeks earlier and they were amazed I could not recall how I paid and seemed put out that I had to produce one of my debit cards that might not be the same to get my refund.  Bummer.< /review>

It's a game shop, it hardly constitutes actual work, so I can't understand why he always has an unfriendly approach to customer service; he gives you a "why are you bothering me attitude". I asked if they have a D&D adventurer's league and he said the DM no longer plays there, I can see why. He said all the people who work there play, but gave me no other advice or ways to meet up to find local players. I'll stick to other local stores and Fantasy Grounds and will not bother you with my money, as you wish. Kids might like the place, but if you're an adult, I'd look elsewhere.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

I went through the drive thru on Sunday night around 6-7 to get the 12 piece leg & thigh family meal. They told me that they only had legs, they were all out for the day. When I got home we noticed it was a mix of legs, thighs, and wings. They gave me 4 wings, 4 legs and it seems like they cut 2 thighs in half to make 4 to complete our order. The worst part wasn't even that. I took two pieces of chicken for lunch and when I was eating the wing I noticed it was a little pink. I started to check the wing and sure enough it was raw. Blood was coming out. idk if there was more like that but I was too late because my husband had already ate his lunch. So if we get sick, we already know why. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!<//text>

it gets busy at lunch time but if u can come before the lunch and you will be fine. The food is good and ive never had any issues with their staff. If you are looking for something sort of healthy compared to buying a burger and fries and dont want to spend too much money, their $5 combos are the best</text>

< Review>
I like this spot! They provide superb meals, they have a rich menu, The chef in that place is a real authority in the kitchen, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The food is consistently of high class, the service towards the guests  is agreeable. I often eat in this place and I was never unsatisfied. Highly recommended.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>In all honesty, it had been awhile since I had eaten anything from El Pollo Loco. I had to proceed through drive thru (Covid-19 choice) which had a long line. Two really good things happened that day. The line moved surprisingly fast, our order was correct and we saved with a coupon. That was #1. We took it home to eat and that's where #2 occurred.  The chicken was hot and juicy, but it was the FLAVOR that stood out to me. Kudos. I'll be going back very soon.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>Within the last month it seems like they hired a bunch of new people who weren't trained correctly. They are friendly , but my Double chicken avocado fit bowl has been missing the cauliflower rice, and is not seasoned. 2 times in a row. I've gotten a bowl with just lettuce, chicken and avocado - bland with no seasoning and missing ingredients.
Really disappointed because I used to love this location. Now I don't feel the same</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
I order a double protein fit bowl it seems like I only got a 1/4 of the protein and when they ask what sauce or salsa you would like. Me very specific 3 green salsas, 2 jalapeño sauce, and no dressing. I didn't get the green sauce but got 8 packages of jalapeño sauce, 2 Pico de Gallo, and dressing. No happy!</review>

<text>Their parking lot actually extends up and around the back of their building. This store's location is set on a very busy part of a very busy street.

I have been a customer of this location for over 10 years. I've checked them on small mistakes, and they have improved - over and over again. The last few times I went in to this Pollo Loco location, I had nothing but a GREAT experience!

Staff was outstanding! Food order delivery time is amazingly quick! Their menu always has new items along with the  standard plates and deals. Their chicken, their salsas and salsa bar are top shelf! Come inside the store to enjoy their salsa bar.

As wretched as many parts of San Bernardino may be, this restaurant maintains its dignity and deserves respect! Great food, outstanding and fast service, clean, quiet eating area, clean restrooms, and decent prices.

Me: Two thumbs up! My Chihuahuas: Four paws up!</text>< rate>

This place is good. It was busy one night and they missed a item on my order. Stephanie was handling this issue and had it taken care of. First off it wasn't that bad, simple mistake, late busy and understandable for it to happen. She replaced the order and we were on our way. This place is clean and safe. One of my favorites and stays on my top five! Thank you guys again!😊</text>

2/23/2020 - Pollo Loco on Highland just east of the 215 - The food was good and my order was correct but this particular Pollo Loco is always a mess. The staff always seems unorganized and the restaurant itself was dirty. There was trash on the floor and the tables hadn't been wiped down. The only reason it's gets this rating is because it wasn't clean. Who I thought was the manager didn't even seem to be concerned with the presentation of the restaurant or how bad it looked, said goodbye and went home. Someone needs to get this place cleaned up. I only go there because it's on the way home but I might have to find another Pollo Loco.< /Text>

<text>Food is good. Very good cook. Employee at the register was rude and un-interested in customer service. Not once she smiled and she shown herself annoyed with my sister and elderly mother's questions about the manu items. All other employees seemed to stay away from her also. About 5-6 employees present all in the back area none at the counter.<//text><username>patty perez</username>< userid>

<Review>Nice clean restaurant, fast service the only thing I didn't like is that I asked the cashier if I could switch two of the drumsticks that came in my family meal for thighs but the man on the grill refuse to do so. I don't understand  why if at other EPL I request the # of thighs and drumsticks I want in my meal and is never an issue.</Review><resp>{'time': 1575817432651, 'text': 'We appreciate your feedback, Tania.

They're fast and accurate. I've only been to this location a handful of times so maybe it's just luck. They could pour more gravy in their individual mashed potatoes.<//Review>

El pollo loco has tasty chicken. The cashier was very helpful when i was ordering. Unfortunately, i had to take one star off due to only receiving 5/6 sides for my 2 orders of mixed 16 pieces meal.

Update 6/17 : i had to dock off an additional star due to a few of my tortillas missing. I only got three flour tortillas, no corn ones in the bag. In addition, they almost forgot one of my sides until i told a worker. Be very careful with your orders, double check your bags before leaving.<//Review>

<review>Food is great. can't complain.  But they seemed to be a little under staffed, takes a bit to have you're order taken. Customers are rude and a bit ghetto. but hey it's S.B. oh and Its probably a good idea to order my Catering. more then 24 hours ahead of time.</review></record></dataset><record>

Good food, but sometimes I have gotten pieces of bone in any order with chopped up chicken, just beware.  The grilled chicken is good.  I miss their sweet potato fries and corn pone.</Text>

I ALWAYS GET OLD AND OVERCOOKED DRIED CHICKEN!  The chicken here is ALWAYS dry even if you ask for your chicken juicy they will give it to you overcooked and dried the one that has been sitting there on the grill for hours.  I tried giving it a few chances since it's the closest one by my house but it never gets better only worse I can't enjoy it last time I will visit I would not recommend going there< /review>

I came to this store at 830 pm and they had no chicken at all. U was told I would have to wait 30 min. The salsa bar was completely empty.  The cook has been there for more than five years.... unexcusable.</review>

on June 20 2017 at 12:19 pm  i received poor drive thru service from this location. the lady at the window was rude simply because i asked her account why 2 brc burrito cost 6.00 with alvacados when i pay less at other places..of course i didnt dare ask her because her attitude was so hostile...food was 👌..it was just her unfriendly attitude.<//Text>

I at least go twice a week and I don't mind waiting because it's not a regular fast food it's more of a wine and dine.  The flavors are so delicious and the customer service is excellent.< /review>

<Review>ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOU WILL ALMOST ALWAYS END UP MISSING HALF OFF YOUR ORDER OR GET OLD AND OVERCOOKED DRIED CHICKEN! The costumer service here is terrible! The chicken here is ALWAYS dry even if you ask for your chicken juicy they will give it to you overcooked and dried the one that has been sitting there on the grill for hours. The mananger (MARIA) here is not friendly she is always in a bad mood. This pollo loco (next to autozone) really sucks I really tried giving it a few chances since it's the closest one by my house but it never gets better only worse and that is why I always go to the one on kendall ave all the employees are very friendly including the manangers and I always get my chicken how I like it it doesn't matter if it's through the drive thru or inside.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>
