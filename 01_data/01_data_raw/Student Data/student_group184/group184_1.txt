This golf course at Rancho Mirage is absolutely beautiful. The Landscaping was perfect and the greens were kept up well. If you can play this course you will see the view of the mountains are breathtaking. Highly recommend<//Text>

I played this course yesterday and I cannot believe how downhill it has gone. We have friends that have been members for years and it was always a top-notch course but yesterday the poor condition of the greens and fairways was hard to miss. There are so many public courses that are in much better shape and people pay tens of thousands of dollars to belong to this one. Don’t do it. Even with a “good deal” on golf now I would not go back.</Text>

Played 9/6/20.  90° at 6:30 am, hit 20 balls  in warm up, tee’d off at 6:45 am, 108° eNd of round.  Heat was not a factor.   This course is well taken care of and was a pleasure to play.   Careful on #9!   I had to 2nd and 3rd guess myself then hit 5 iron off the blue tee to safely land off to the left landing area by the 2nd farther crossing bridge.   Then its a straight shot to the green.  Great course, 3 hour 25 minute round.<//Text>

Nice staff, a little over priced for conditioning of course. Good place to work on your swing. It could really be spectacular with the backdrop of the mountains.< /Text>

We played a round at 8:00 am at the S and played in under 3 hours. Loved the course, loved the price and loved the pace. The layout is more traditional, but it’s well kept and scenic. I had my putter damaged in transit and they let me borrow one from the pro-shop, very appreciative of the great service. Would 100% play again.</Text>

Great golf course! Definitely feels like you're back in time when you play here. It's a pleasure to play golf courses that keep that old classy style play. Not a long course but definitely strategic off the tee with well placed fairway and greenside bunkers. Water features come into play in close to half the holes I'd say. Lush lies almost everywhere you go. Only issue I'd say is to speed up the greens a bit. Greens seem grainy and could use some more attention to them from the greenskeepers. All in all a great experience! Will recommend<//Text>

Loved our server,  she did everything to make us happy.
Couldn't get into the restaurant for our wine choice so we had to pick one from the bar,  not big deal,  but that took 15 minutes. She took our order and came out another 15 minutes later to appoliagize and was very honest, "the chef needs to defrost the steaks....they brought out some house made chips (different).
The food came eventually,  it's was not great but it was not bad,  truly the server was the saving grace with her honesty and the fact she did everything to make it right, she even made me the garlic aioli for my steak sandwich.
I'd go back for dinner,  I hear they have a wonderful prime rib on Saturday night.< /Review>

<review>The $18 burger was medium well when I asked for medium, had to get my own mustard, maybe 3 waitresses in the whole room. Waited 1.5 hours to get waited on... Service was the worst I ever had. Shame on the management.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>We love it here for both children! The entire staff is friendly, focused, and organized. The dental team is thorough and highly-skilled. We are always so impressed with their kid-friendly acumen; the children are treated with respect and spoken to as equals. The dental team does an excellent job walking through the steps of their procedures so the child feels comfortable and knows what to expect along the way. Their website is also full of valuable information - check it out! This Dentistry came highly recommended to us by our pediatrician, and we are so thankful.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb4660a5ba25:0x4eedd6b7bc354db9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We have used Dr. Stone and her office since we moved to Santa Monica in 2015. My kids have always had the best experience here, with movies playing, prizes for good visits and kind and thoughtful staff. Even when my kids have had difficult procedures performed, like tooth extractions, they have still had a positive experience without any fear. We absolutely love this office and can not recommend them enough.< /Review>

The team at Santa Monica Dentistry for Children is great. Professional, organized, and always on time which is very important when you’ve got three little ones. The staff is patient and takes their time. I love the combination of orthodontics as well. A good fit for our family. Definitely recommend.</Text>

It's always a pleasure to visit your office.  The staff is very friendly and the office is very clean.  My 4-year-old is always excited for his 6-month check up.  I would give 10 stars if I could.< /Review>

<text>Dr. Norman and her team are simply the best. Great bedside manner. Very safe environment which is especially important during a pandemic and always the best dental work. My daughter sat quietly for a mold for a retainer to come and for adjustments to her braces. Great visit. Highly recommend.</text>< Pictures>

After a big move during the pandemic times from one side of the country to another, I needed to find a good place for my kids to check their teeth. I found Santa Monica Dentistry on Google and I couldn’t be happier! From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed and helped in seconds! All the staff is super friendly and professional! We were helped by Dr. Kim, she is absolutely professional, kind and the way she connected with my kids was wonderful! Thank you so much for making us feel welcomed in your practice! We can’t wait to see you again in 6 months!!< /text>

Santa Monica Dentistry for children has been taking care of our son since he was 3 years old. He is now 9 years old. The customer service is second to no other, all of the staff treats customers with the respect and so friendly. The dentist and dental assistants really take pride in making sure their little patients are comfortable with every procedure.  Great place to take your kids!!< /text>

My children's experience at Santa Monica Dentistry for children is always exceptional.  Even while getting a cavity fixed, my 9 y.o. daughter was completely at ease due to the kind and gentle explanations from Dr. Jessie Schwartz, and the wonderful staff who are with her every step of the way.  I can't say enough good things about Santa Monica Dentistry for children, and both of my children have been going here for 8 years!</Review>

The entire staff is truly amazing. Always pleasant and always available to answer questions, etc. My kids love going there and never complain about having to go.  Having a dentist and orthodontist in the same practice is great and they are able to work together during the appt. if there is a dental issue or orthodontia issue. Couldn't be happier with them. They are the best!< /review>

The entire staff is incredible! Dr. Stone is so good with both children and their parents. She takes the time to address any concerns and thoroughly explains her analysis of your child's teeth. My son actually looks forward to going to the dentist. They really "get" kids here!<//text>

I have been to this place twice for my three-year-old daughter’s dental checkup. She enjoys as her teeth being cleaned and examined by the nurse and the doctor. I experienced a great care.

The environment is kid-friendly. There are supplies for children to scribble or color on the appropriate places provided in the waiting area. This place has TV to keep the kids calm while at the critical checkups. After every checkup, each child is allowed to take one toy out of plenty of little toys. Overall, I highly recommend this dentistry.</Text>

< Review>
We've been through a few pediatric dentists over the years, and Dr. Schwarz and her team have been the best--hands down. You need to have super powers to talk an anxious kid into the dental chair and keep them there when the going gets tough. This dentist is the real deal. And the staff are simply wonderful. My only complaint is that I wish they serviced adults.</Review>

<text>Both of my children are always excited to go to SMDC and never afraid even when they have had fillings.  The office is beautiful, state of the art, and clean as can be.  The dentists are not just wonderful dentists, they are wonderful people.  Same goes for every hygienist and receptionist we have seen over the last four years.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMEND.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

There is no other dentist office equal to SM Dentistry for Children. The care and knowledge/expertise of Dr. Stone and her highly trained staff is unparalleled. I wish she had time to include adult patients, but I’m so glad she pours her time and love into these littles. We’ve been with this office since my son started sprouting teeth. He’s six and a half now and every time we go, my son is so happy. He has a very complicated mouth situation, so his joy is truly attributed to the wonderful way Dr. Stone has demanded excellence of herself and her staff. They have thought of everything to ensure each child’s visit is the best possible experience. I am so thankful to encourage and recommend other parents get to this office straight away for any children’s dental needs. You’ll be relieved you found her!< /review>

Dr. Stone and her staff make taking your children to the dentist a fun and educational experience.  They are gentle, kind and so sweet, not to mention extremely proficient.  I would highly recommend Santa Monica Dentistry for Children to anyone looking for a pediatric dentist.  They are the absolute best!< /review>

I brought my 2.5 year old son to Dr. Stone for the first time today. Both Dr. Stone and the hygienist Annelle were so patient and wonderful in explaining everything calmly to my son as they went through the cleaning, and Dr. Stone took as much time with me as I needed to ask questions. I had a question about my baby daughter's teeth too (even though it wasn't her appointment) and Dr. Stone happily talked with me about that as well. I'm so happy we found them!< /Review>

We have been coming to this office since my now 4 year old was about a year old. They are so kid friendly and give the perfect amount of enthusiasm to really keep her entertained and happy throughout the appointment. They always have a fun movie playing, cute sunglasses to help with the light and they have about 20 different flavors of toothpaste. If you have a child and they aren't coming here, you're missing out!!!</text>

<Text>Very kid friendly environment. I appreciate how positive and understanding the dentist is. My son's teeth had a lot of plaque and rather than make me feel guilty about it, she was sympathetic and helped me see how I could improve in the future.

My son likes going to the dentist because he gets to watch a movie and pick a prize, and I like it because his teeth are now clean and healthy again.< /Text>< Pictures>

Lee's first time to the dentist and it went so well. The technician and Dr Stone were so kind and patient with him. It is such a sweet environment and all my boy's love to go for their check-ups. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness.</text>

<Text>I love taking my daughter to Santa Monica Dentistry for Children. Both Dr. Stone and Dr. Schwartz are Moms and you can really tell.  The first time my daughter went to the dentist, Dr. Stone sat with her for about 20 patiently getting her to open her mouth. Dr. Stone explained everything and joked with my daughter, who finally let her "count" her teeth. Since then my daughter has gone to the dentist with pleasure. She loves getting new toothbrushes and the special prizes. I only wish that my dentist was as gentle and kind as Dr. Stone.<//Text><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2bb4660a5ba25:0x4eedd6b7bc354db9< /GmapID><user_id>113137188838515671138< /user_id>< user_name>

EXCELLENT! My 2 year old daughter fell and cut her gums and lip on a friday at 5:00pm. They not only took me but spent extra time making sure my daughter was calm, happy and walked away with a huge smile. I cannot  recommend this dental practice more! Dr. Ellen Stone is a STAR!< /Text>

I ABSOLUTELY love bringing my son to see Dr. Schwarz and her staff.  Today was just not a good experience, and I'm sure it was just one of those days, and the luck of the draw.  I checked my son in early since we needed to use the restroom.  I informed the front desk staff that we are in no rush.  My son was called and he was apprehensive to get started.  The staff member said 'i'll be right back' and my partner carried my son into the back and none of the staff members knew who had called in my son.  The same staff member came from around the corner and said loudly 'oh, they are 30 mins early, so i'm just going to take someone else', and walked away.  I acknowledge that were early, and had even mistaken the appointment by 15 minutes, but I felt she was very aggressive, yet dismissive in her way of handling the moment.  I really do enjoy this office and have always enjoyed my experience.  I know this will not happen again at my son's next appointment.  A little bit of kindness does go a long way.<//text>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>This was the most upsetting experience I have ever had taking my child to the dentist. There were an enormous amount of clues I should have picked up on before I let her give him fillings, from billing to various other issues, but nothing was more upsetting than her. Number one she told me when we went in to see her that he had a large amount of cavities. I have now taken those x-rays to a separate dentist to have them evaluated and according to her she didn't see any, however initially I trusted her. She suggested that we don't do them all at once and break it up in 2 appointments. She then asked me if he was afraid of needles.. I said no more that the average child but my older one had a bit more of a phobia for needles and could still handle a shot in the mouth. She suggested that we should to nitrous/ laughing gas but I really wasn't comfortable with that. She again insisted and that it just made the whole experience less traumatic for the child. When we came back and I again expressed my concern about nitrous she again insisted that it was not a big deal, but in fact it was extremely traumatic.. not for him but for me. As I watched essentiality him being drugged while she had a tv monitor inches from his face playing some kids movie I realized that this was more for her benefit than the child's. The kids are so out of it and distracted it makes it easy for her to do her job. I was so effected by the experience I felt I almost never wanted to take him to another dentist. When I called the office to ask why she insisted that he get nitrous she apparently had noted in his chart that he was needle phobic which never came form my mouth.

I have since found an amazing desist who has done new x-rays and said that he does not need any of the remaining filings that she suggested. I would suggest to any parents to stay away from her. She is greedy, lazy and unethical, I am so relieved to find a great trust worthy dentist who doesn't feel its necessary to drug every kid that comes n for a filling..</Review><Time>1462659019787< /Time><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My 2, soon to be 3 year old unfortunately has some cavities. My husband took him to his first appointment which is where we discovered all our diligent teeth brushing and flossing did not pay off.
I went today for his follow up. I didn’t think much of the office UNTIL we got called in. Fun and bright orange and very warm energy. TV screens on the ceilings! How could you not LOVE going to the dentist??
Meeting Dr. Schwarz: THE SWEETEST and SOOO genuinely warm. Made me sad I never had a dentist like her growing up and so very blessed to have her for my children. She was reassuring and gentle. My son is horrible at sitting still. But was great about letting her check his teeth. Really, to me she’s just incredible. And with the routine she gave us, were able to hold off more decay.
Lastly, my son knows there’s a toy box. I have no clue but I follow him to this... mini prize area. Bouncy balls, toy cars, dinosaurs...and soo much more!! I spoke with one of the hygienist/assistants who is in charge of the unbelievable toy box. She goes to great efforts to make that toy area sooo special. She watched my son try to load up.  He had 8 toy cars and I luckily managed to get him to put 7 back down. But it made her so happy watching him which in turn made me smile.
I’m now blown away and slightly jaded I only got floss and a mean hygienist from my dentist growing up. They genuinely love kids here. They just want to see your child smile, happy, and enjoy going to the dentist. Which is far from my own experience. This is the place to go. Honest. I don’t do reviews. Only a few and it’s because I found myself compelled to, in a good way because I was moved by kindness or had really special unique experience.</Review>

<review>Dr Jessie Schwarz is fantastic.  My son had so much cavities and a medical condition that all the dentists I took him to before Dr. Schwarz weren't confident to treat him.  They either referred me to other dental specialists or even to a dental surgeon.  Earlier doctors suggested that my toddler son to be put out completely with general anesthesia for them to get the work done.  As young he is and I don't believe that the earlier doctors' opinion is in the best interest for my son.  I kept searching for the best children dentists in town and I found Dr. Schwarz.  Dr. Schwarz was able to treat severe cavities for my son without general anesthesia.  She and her assistant have ways to keep my generally very anxious son calm before and during the treatments.  My son cavities were taken care of and he is not afraid to go to Dr. Schwarz's office.   I'm very happy with this doctor and her staffs.  They are highly recommended.< /review>< pics>

<review>Hi,
This review is for Henry Mercado.
I met Henry about 14 years ago in a Verizon store in Cupertino while dealing with a frustrating issue with my account. In a few minutes not only did he resolved the issue, but he was extremely empathetic . Henry's personality and professionalism has been the reason why we referred him, resulting in three other families going to him. When he transitioned to this new location we followed him. He is a kind person with a great heart ❤. He is dedicated to his career and understands the needs of his clients and looks after the image and impact of the company he works for. He is a humble and honest person committed to helping others without any prejudice. I have seen how other people enjoy doing business with him and how respectful he is to his colleagues.

Best Regards to Henry and his bosses.

I am sooooooooo impressed with Wynn Vuong’s customer service! Very clear and helpful from start to end. Answered all my questions thoroughly and assisted me diligently. Wynn handled everything with ease and made the process go very smoothly. I felt 100% comfortable and satisfied with the service I received today! I am so grateful to have Wynn’s help today. THANKS WYNN!<//Review>

I am writing this to Ms. Wynn for her excellent customer service, patient and great knowledge of the service I have received the last two days. Ms.Wynn Vuong took time to explained and guided me throughout the process (I’m new to iPhone).😩
My husband and I are very happy and could not wait to start using our new iPhone 12, and we will be referring all our friends and family to Wynn.
👍👍👍👍

Thank you,
Chris & Dan</Text>

My sister and I came to the store in January 2021 hoping to get new phones. We were so lucky to meet with Wynn Vuong who supported us in changing new plans in order to be matching with our new phones. Wynn was really friendly, helpful, and kind.

We came back in March 2021 to meet with Wynn again asking for help to clarify our bills. It took only 20' for Wynn to call the customer services and clear our concerns.

We really appreciated the services Wynn has been providing.

Thanks,
Khanh Dang</Review>

This review is for Austin. Austin was extremely helpful and patient in helping me set up my new phone. He went out of his way to ensure my phone was working properly. It’s evident that Austin is knowledgeable in the technology department, as he was able to successfully back up my old device to the new one without any difficulties, as well as answer all of my questions. I would refer him to anybody in the market for a new phone or looking to transfer to Verizon. Thank you Austin! Your time and effort is very much appreciated.< /text>

I rarely give reviews but I have to for Wynn Vuong at Verizon store in Eastridge mall, San Jose.  I came in with a problematic phone number that another sale associate couldn’t resolve previously.   Wynn took care of it within 15 minutes. I was so amazed at her superb knowledge and efficiency!  If you ever needed help with your phone, Wynn is the one to go to.  Thanks Wynn!!!</text>

Wynn Vuong was very transparent and direct with our visit today. If you ever want to make an appointment, do it with her. She explained everything throughly and was extremely patient, even when we asked the same question in so many different ways. She even helped us save money on our monthly bill. Thanks Wynn!< /text>

I came in today because my Jetpack stopped working all of a sudden, and I could not seem to get it back on the network. I called Customer Care and they transferred me to Tech Support, but my issue remained. Thankfully, Wynn VƯỢNG was able to troubleshoot and got my device within minutes. I wish I had come to the store first and not wasted so much time on the phone. Thank you Wynn!!< /Text>

HENRY HENRY HENRY. I was having a bad morning and not looking forward to going into Verizon to set up my new phone. My experience with Henry uplifted my spirits and totally made my day better with his professional customer service. He took care of me like a BOSS. I will not hesitate to return to this location because of the exceptional service I was provided.</Text>

<text>Appreciated the help Wynn Vuong has provided to my parents with their iPad today.  They came in twice before, but they didn’t understand the advantage of the $150 off and refused the deal.  But they wanted the new iPad, and today they finally bought one.

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I have been a Verizon customer for more than a decade (almost 2) and I have always liked the service and our plan. I have been to this location many of times over the years and have always had a good experience but on Saturday, January 18, 2020 I had the BEST EXPERIENCE with Flex. He not only helped me with a travel pass for my daughter who was traveling to India for 10 days but he helped me understand my bill and lower it by making a few modifications and changes! I got the updated phone I was due and I get to pay less each month than I had been for the past two years! Flex's level of expertise, professionalism and kindness was outstanding! I left there feeling good about being able to keep in contact with my daughter while she was out of the country and we never had a dropped call, missed text or any delay in communicating. Kudos to Verizon for their excellent coverage and a HUGE THANK YOU to Flex for easing my mind and making my monthly plan more affordable. FLEX YOU ROCK!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Flex was amazing. He was super helpful and showed how we could save money by enrolling in direct deposit and taking advantage of a great promotion. He followed up w resolving billing issues and was extremely courteous and a great communicator.</Review>

This was my family's best experience at any Verizon store we have gone into years. The thought of a crowd and long wait annoyed us but when I arrived there were only a few people. We initially came for a new sim card for my cousin who traveled back to the states and Flex was the person who helped us. Flex insisted that we take a look out our current bill and Flex asked us if we understood the bill. We told him not entirely and he spent 30 minutes of his time explaining all the charges which was nice of him. My daughter asked him how much an iPhone would cost monthly and he brought out several papers to generate quotes by hand. The part that was fishy was when he told us he could upgrade 3 of our phones and give us a new iPad and our bill would decrease but we were interested even though the sales people are tricky. Flex told us he was different which they all say but he really was different. He showed us our future bills from the Verizon app before we left the store and we were amazed how correct his math was with taxes without using a calculator. Our bill dropped by $125 monthly and he continued to follow up with my family for two months making sure everything was okay which was nice of him.< /Review>

We came here to upgrade my parents phone and met Irshad who greeted us well and explained everything very patiently to my elderly parents, he answered all theirs and my questions politely and took time to make us understand the promotions. He was very helpful and I recommend him if you are visiting the store. I will always be going to him whenever I need new phones. Amazing talent and a perfect person to have on the team. Awesome job team Verizon Eastridge<//review>

<date>1568077015424</date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Nothing but good things to say about this store from my personal visits to switch back from AT&T. After being very unsatisfied with AT&T’s mobile network service and customer service in store, I ended up walking into this Verizon retailer. Greeted and welcomed in by the very knowledgeable staff I sat down with Thomas to make the switch back to Verizon. I explained my situation to him and he assured me that everything I wanted to do in terms of switching back with the same plan, number, and zero fees would all be doable. After a mistake occurred on the phone due to the customer service representative that needed to be contacted to process the post payment account, he experienced a lot of trouble which ended up delaying the whole process by a day. I came in the next day on my lunch after my phone being disconnected prior due to my number being completely ported over, he continued to have trouble with the account through my whole lunch and asked me if I’d be willing to leave my phone and information in the “Notes” app on my iPhone. So I did, when I came back after work Thomas was waiting for me with a working phone, completely switched over on a post payment account and I was nothing but relieved to know that he was able to give me everything I was promised. Definitely an employee that will make you recommend his workplace to your friends and family.

-A Very Satisfied Customer :)< /text>< pictures>

Flex was so helpful, professional and pro-active -- I was having some trouble with my account/ billing issues and he stayed on top of my case, and communicated with me daily until he found a solution to my issue. He was able to take care of something I had been dealing with the customer service number for weeks in less that 24 hours. I feel very comfortable in recommending Flex . Thank you so much for taking care of me!< /Text>

<Text>Han provided excellent service for my Mother and I at Verizon today. She was very knowledgeable and patient with us. Especially my mother, as she’s older and asks a million questions about how to do this and that on her new phone. She went above and beyond. She put on our screen protectors for us and helped us get them registered. She made the headache of transferring everything over to a new phone a lot less painful. Thank you Han for all that you do. You are an asset to the company and they are lucky to have you!<//Text>< Time>

Ruth is amazing! I came in because my phone was acting up. She looked and spent time to diagnose and I had a iPhone 7 that was too old. So she helped me upgrade 2 phones at once. One where I forgot codes and passwords and one that was so big that the backup took so long. She did not rush me and completed that. I also had a lot of other things to ask and we completed after 4 hours! She was sweet, helpful, and so thorough. Best experience anywhere so far!</Review>

Came in looking to upgrade my line and a wonderful rep by the name of Travis helped me out. This gentleman is really knowledgeable about the products that are offered and helped pick out which one would fit my lifestyle. On another note he helped me save money on my bill by analyzing all the things that weren’t being put to use and making enough space on my bill to the point where all the junk I was essentially paying for went towards a tablet!

I highly recommend stopping by! Their customer service is far beyond any other Verizon store I’ve been too :))<//Text>

If you want to get scammed, have your bill go up more than 200%, and have numbers you never signed up for added to your plan, this is the place to go. They ruined my account and it's been a nightmare trying to get it fixed again. The workers will give you their number to resolve problems, but they won't answer calls or return them. They have a phone at the store but they leave it off the hook so you can't call in. They promised with the new plan my bill would go down, instead I got a text message from Verizon wanting over $600 for numbers I didn't add to a plan because they screwed up when working with the account.< /Review>

Travis and DAN DAN are probably the best duo ever. Loved working with both of them. They are very knowledgeable of the phones and the plans. Make sure to ask for them, and if youre lucky you'd get the chance to work with them too. Absolutely love my new LG phone. I'm so glad they convinced me into getting it. Thanks again guys!!< /review>

Always get great help here. Been coming here for 6 yrs now for new or upgraded devices. I've only had one issue but this staff went out of their way to correct it. Been a Verizon customer for well over 17 yrs. I don't mind paying the extra $$ for reliable customer service and a shop like this one. Lance helped me out the last couple of times. I'll give his service 5 stars as well.</Text>

Jessica and Derek helped me out today and their customer service skills were absolutely on point. Jessica showed patience and kindess not only to me and the zillion questions I had, but also to Derek, whom she was training in the process. They let me try out the microphones on different phones, which was a very important feature for me, and they took the time to listen to my personal needs for the phone so as to match me up with the best option. Really, what stood out most was Jessica's attentiveness. She was very present, never giving the impression that there was a rush to another customer or to wrap up a sale. She and Derek really took the time to just be with me and talk about my options, which means a lot to me as I don't know much about phones and wasn't happy with my previous purchase.

The physical wave of relief as they handed me my new phone was too too real. They made my day and totally saved the rest of my week (from my shattered old phone) both on a professional and personal level. Best phone purchase experience EVER. Thanks a million, you two!</text>

<text>I am writing to let you know how much I appreciated the service I received on Dec 7, 2018 when I entered your store (CCEL- San Jose Eastridge) to change my cell phone service from AT&T to Verizon and purchase a new cell phone.

Cecily Rodriguez greeted with a smile and was very helpful in guiding me through the process.  She was polite, attentive, and knowledgeable.  We discussed how I used my phone and what I wanted to be able to do.  Once she reviewed my current plan and knew what I was looking for, she was able to offer me a plan, equivalent to my current plan, at a lower cost.  She offered me a phone that met me needs and did not try to sell me the most expensive phone in the store.  She helped set up the phone and answered all my questions.  If she didn’t know the answer to one of questions, she found out the answer.  I was not forced into buying anything I did not want.  I left the store with a smile and her contact information so I could call her in case I had any questions.
I returned the following day to set up My Verizon Account.  She set up the account and answered any questions that I had.

I also want to share that all the Customer Service Reps, in the store, were very friendly and pleasant to talk to. They offered me water on both visits.  This was a great experience.  Thank you Verizon and Cecily for your GREAT SERVICE!  I will definitely return.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1544637754844, 'text': 'We are so happy to welcome you to the Cellular Sales/Verizon family, Charlotte!

<Text>Staff has been off and on at this location for years. I went in today and they changed the layout and staff. Love the layout and the staff was helpful and very knowledgeable. My cousin and I were helped by a very nice young woman with a new purchase. She pitched all 3 or 4 of the current IphoneX promotions as she should and understood that we weren't interested. I am glad to say this employee did not push us too hard which could always lead to an uneasy customer experience. Great job< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

Thanks God this store has Han!!! She helped me with translating things to my mom. I mean I love my mom but she's never satisfied with my Vietnamese. Han explained everything to me in English then turned to my mom and explained things once again in Vietnamese. She's the best, my mom also loves her!</Text>

Came in here on a Sat morning needing help with my account and phone. I was greeted by Travis Bringas. He was super friendly! I was notified that I would have to pay extra for something, but after much research on Travis' part he was able to fix my problem with another solution, and I didn't have t pay. He could have easily charged me, but I liked his honesty, and helpfulness. I would come back again, and if you have a chance ask for Travis!< /text>

< Review>
TLDR: VZW phone support took 5hours to do what Travis was able to do in minutes. Come here for amazing customer service.

You guys. So I recently got a Pixel 3 XL and was having some troubles with completing the activation process. I've always done my own phone transfers and activations. And with the new Samsungs it was even easier so I'm not sure why I had issues. I called VZW customer support and I'm not sure where the miscommunication was but the kind lady on the phone told me I had to go in store to get a new sim card. I listened because we were both struggling at that point. 5 hours later we were still struggling so I decided to try a different Verizon store. The one closer to me was too full and low and slow on staffing so Eastridge Lp was my next best bet. You have no idea how it feels to see a familiar face, TRAVIS!!!!!. This good looking man used to work at your local Gen BBQ (multiple locations). You'll be happy to know those customer service skills have only gotten better over time. I was in and out of the store in less than minutes. It turns out the phone assist entered my sim incorrectly. He found the issue, fixed it, suggested phone cases and accesories, and sent me on my merry way asap. I should've just gone here to start. I would've had a working phone for hours instead of stress and frustration.

10/10 would highly recommend.<//Review>

Zan was great, helped me figure out why my ringtone was going silent. Turns out 12.4 was the culprit. Also showed me how to clip my own ringtones from my music and gave me a little insight into living in Oregon which I’m planning on doing. Come see this guy, absolute professional.<//review>

Firstly the 4 isn't for Lance, Lance was wonderful and gets a 5. The 4 is simply because the environment was a little hap hazard. It took two attempts at installing a screen protector to be successful because of how dusty the place is .That seems waistful. Also most of the display phones were dead.

Lance, guided me towards a product that I hadn't initially considered but was overall better for my lifestyle among other reasons. The phone is having a couple issues so I'm taking it in for the qr day warranty. I won't be changing phones just trading in my lemon.<//Text>

Went in to trade in my Dad’s phone for the iPhone 8 Plus and Keith was just awesome. He had answers to all of our questions, made recommendations on how to properly back up our data, activated and set up my dad’s new phone, and got us on the road within an hour. Thank you for taking the time to explain all the bells and whistles of my dad’s fancy new phone!<//text>

<review>I came into this store searching for the best deal possible and the gentleman who helped me out, Lance -- was very knowledgable about all the products and promos that I could take advantage of just for being a new customer. Through the tedious transaction, Lance was both patient and helpful, I highly recommend seeing him for the best deals :)

<text>This location has improved immensely, its in the mall so not crazy slammed all the time. Zan the manager and Lee, the guy he was training turned activating my insurannce replacement phone into paying it off, crediting my account $30 for charges I missed , and got my bill reduced with a new LG phone and even got everything back , without my now lost old phone! Work with Zan and Lee, i am seriously impressed, i just got more money then i paid for my insurance phone, a brand new phone, an account credit,  AND my bill went down. Zan and Lee are both the man you need to see!!!< /text></record>

<Text>Walked in yesterday with my family in hopes to add my parents to my line.I was greeted immediately after walking in by not one or two of the workers but 3! Joseph A. (originally from a Fresno branch) was the person who approached me about what I needed help with.I said I needed to add 2 lines to my account and I was unsure of the process.He was so knowledgeable and affable the whole transaction was a breeze!He explained every step of the way.His other coworker-Hector? (I didn't quite catch his name-he was also from a different branch) also jumped in to help transfer information from my parents' old phone to their brand new Samsung S9+! The energy between all the workers was so positive and you can really tell they enjoy working with others and each other!Way to go with stepping up in making this Verizon location much better than it has been! My parents are ADDICTED to their phones and new accessories all because the help and smooth transitioning of you all! Thanks Joseph for being so cooperative with my dad and his questions,appreciate it!I will definitely send more people your way!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Drove two hours  South of my home to return a phone to this specific Verizon store.  The staff was amazing.  Derek, an associate  at the store,  was extremely helpful and very professional.

Kim Cisek went above and beyond to help with a phone issue I had been dealing with unsuccessfully. Her level of knowledge and superior customer service was outstanding. She showed true concern for my issues from Start to finish. She was able to handle my issue while assisting other staff members simultaneously and all with a smile.

I have delt with many other Verizon stores in the 15+ years of being a customer and it can be frustrating at times,  but this was truely a pleasant experience. I would highly recommend this store and their staff.</Text><rating>5< /rating>< name>

<GmapID>0x808e32a11070d717:0x7f6c9201dbb9aec<//GmapID><Text>TLDR: VZW phone support took 5hours to do what Travis was able to do in minutes. Come here for amazing customer service.

You guys. So I recently got a Pixel 3 XL and was having some troubles with completing the activation process. I've always done my own phone transfers and activations. And with the new Samsungs it was even easier so I'm not sure why I had issues. I called VZW customer support and I'm not sure where the miscommunication was but the kind lady on the phone told me I had to go in store to get a new sim card. I listened because we were both struggling at that point. 5 hours later we were still struggling so I decided to try a different Verizon store. The one closer to me was too full and low and slow on staffing so Eastridge Lp was my next best bet. You have no idea how it feels to see a familiar face, TRAVIS!!!!!. This good looking man used to work at your local Gen BBQ (multiple locations). You'll be happy to know those customer service skills have only gotten better over time. I was in and out of the store in less than minutes. It turns out the phone assist entered my sim incorrectly. He found the issue, fixed it, suggested phone cases and accesories, and sent me on my merry way asap. I should've just gone here to start. I would've had a working phone for hours instead of stress and frustration.

10/10 would highly recommend.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Zan Tahir was one of the best Verizon personnel I've come into contact in years. He was upbeat from the start. Answered all my questions, and went above and beyond. He helped me get through a cellular transfer and was awesome all the way to the end. Definitely check out this store. I was extremely impressed.

<text>My girlfriend and I decided to transition from our previous wireless provider to Verizon and also take advantage of Verizon's buy one get one free offer. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Grace Sammut. She was able to answer all of the questions I had and put my mind at ease. It was at this point that we decided that we could trust her for she had expert knowledge of Verizon's promotions, devices, and service plans and make the switch from T- Mobile. She helped us back up our data and transferred our photos and apps to our new Samsung Galaxy S9's. I was very pleased with her service and would highly recommend that new customers and existing customers speak with Grace if they want to upgrade or sign up with Verizon Wireless. Thank you for your patience and professionalism Grace Sammut!< /text>< rating>

Han was very patient and nice, I had to translate for my parents the whole time and they kept changing their minds about what color to get and Han waited for us to finally pick one. She was also very friendly AND professional dealing with our needs.

This location isn’t the closest from my place, but I will come to this Verizon when I need to. Go Han!!<//Review>

<Review>Today I needed to upgrade my IPhone and I was helped by a very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous sales rep named LeeAnn. I couldn’t have been more happier for a smooth and fast transaction!  She ensured that everything wasn’t missed in transferring data, etc. and I I’m confident using my new IPhone X will be a pleasant experience. Thank you LeeAnn, for everything.</Review><user_name>Jdeq Rojas</user_name>< rate>

<review>Went into Verizon Eastridge today 7-19-18 and had the pleasure of working with Jose Almaraz. We did some things on our account and also wanted to buy new phones. First I wanted to lower my bill. Jose gave us some great options. We then were introduced to a Google Pixel 2, what a great phone. Jose went thru EVERYTHING about this phone
and showed us how to use it, he made it so simple, even for us older generation. He is a wonderful service rep and worked with us for a very long time. We so appreciate his patience. Please also know I have been a long  time customer and will continue to be because of Jose Almaraz. Thanks Jose!!!!!< /review>< username>

A couple days ago, I got the dreaded black screen on my 3-year old Galaxy S6 and took it in to the Eastridge Verizon.  I was greeted right away by LeeAnn.  She tried to reboot my phone but didn't have any luck.  She asked questions to zero in on what I was looking for in a phone and I selected one fairly quickly.  She was able to access my contacts and photos using my Yahoo and Gmail accounts and transferred them to the new phone.  Unfortunately, she wasn't able to transfer my texts because my phone was not functioning.  She and another associate explained that I could pay to have someone access and transfer the texts.  Well, the next day, my old phone was once again working.  So I took it in and LeeAnn transferred the texts as well.  Thank you, LeeAnn, for the great customer service!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Thank the heavens that this Verizon store had an employee and management makeover!! New staff (cellular sales) has definitely made this place a quality customer service heaven. My friend and I were having huge billing issues because of previous Verizon employees misled us, but the new staff helped sort everything out super fast and my plan to leave Verizon was cancelled. I would like to give a big shoutout and special thank you to Donavyn who was the main person who helped us sort everything out. He is a true customer service superstar, is extremely knowledgable and he went above and beyond to help us feel that we mattered and our case will be worked on. I almost went to legal counsel and was about to cut ties with Verizon, but thanks to Donavyn and his manager, everything worked out. Most phone stores I visit always show their "commission based sales" side, but Donavyn definitely put us as customers first. Thank you Donavyn!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Han is sure that I can buy the phone I need, not the phone I want. Thank you Han for taking the time for me because I'm not very good at telephones. She is indeed a precious gift from Verizon. Thank you Han again.

Trước khi cho tôi thấy điện thoại tôi muốn. Hân hỏi tôi kĩ càng về việc tôi sử dụng ra sao muốn nó để làm gì. Hân chắc chắn rằng tôi mua được điện thoại tôi cần chứ không phải điện thoại tôi muốn.

Should be 10 ⭐️’s! Happened to get the manager, Gary to help us on selecting phone upgrades. He was extremely knowledgeable, taking the time to explain the differences and all the features. He very patiently answered all questions and guided us. What a great experience, customer service the way it should be! Thank you Gary , you’re the best!<//text>

After purchasing a new Samsung phone (from Puretalk) I struggled for about 7 days to follow the "instructions" printed in tiny type in a small leaflet, the only instructions included with the phone.  I was essentially unable to obtain any response from the new phone, although the display did activate with a meaningless symbol.  I have over 50 years of experience with computer use, including programming, but always before have had meaningful instructions to refer to.  Not so, from Samsung!
Finally, completely and interminably baffled, I took the phone to GoWireless, and turned the problem over to David.  After about an hour of manipulation, David succeeded in transferring the info from my old Samsung to my new one!
When my problem was solved, I asked for the fee.  David's answer:  "NO CHARGE"
In despair</Text>

Very happy but Tuesday I went in because my mom's phone is supposed to have internet  but she doesn't.  The female behind the counter was so rude. I tried to explain that I was deaf and couldn't understand what she was saying. I went up to the counter and she backed way up. What part of deaf didn't she understand.  She kept talking I'm guessing.  Made no attempt to  communicate with me.  I would have appreciated her writing down what she's saying.  Non professional.  The guys are great.

After 7 plus hours of dealing with several other people and being on hold for technology help and being furious, I finally was able to get my new phone set up with the amazing assistance of Jeanette.  She was calm, kind, and very knowledgeable. I think she's great!! Thank you again, Jeanette!!< /text>

Went in about a week ago, and I have to say they were all great! The whole team worked with me and my son to get his phone upgraded as fast as they could. When I first got there I was greeted by Chris. Him and Jill looked through my plan and account to find me the best deal they could. Once we had decided what we were going to get Chris did all of our paper work and rang us out. While another staff member helped my son get all of his content transferred. It was quick and easy. A+ customer service guys! I will definitely be coming here for all my future phone needs!</Review>

I can't thank the staff at the Alpine Verizon store enough for all the time they spent with helping me and my husband upgrade our "dinosaur flip phones" to our new lg G5's. The staff here was very genuine and knowledgeable​ about the savings on each phone. We even got our accessories paid for with a coupon! Even though it's a small store they have so much to offer and ALOT MORE time to spend with each customer that enters the store. If you need to go to Verizon for ANY reason I highly recommend you go see the Alpine team!< /text>

I worked with an excellent young man who was so good to me and when I had a problem he helped solved it. He's a good guy and very knowledgeable, if you are in the area and need help stop and ask for Edgar.<//text>

Went into this verizon store not expecting much but Cody really restored my faith. My bill was lowered by almost 120 dollars and I still got a great brand new phone. Love this store.<//text>

<review>Verizon’s customer service has left a lot to be desired but this store has gone above and beyond to help me out with my questions and to insure that I am well taken care of.

Have been in Verizon stores across the country. This is by far the rudest one. When we walked in they seemed annoyed to help us. Then they said they would charge us to help us transfer our contacts with a replacement phone from Verizon . Been going for 20 years to local locations and they have NEVER once charged us for this. I would recommend you go elsewhere and the Corporate Verizon should be concerned with this location representing them!<//Text>

<review>I have been a Verizon customer for years.
My reckomdation is ALWAYS go to the Grossmount Verizon store. It's a corporate office/store. Those people are honest and highly knowledgeable. They are never wrong!! Can't say much for the franchise store in Alpine. Why Verizon let's stupid people use their name is beyond me ????
SHAME ON YOU VERIZON you let the quality of your product be compromised be unqualified people representing you. I should know...I've had the experience repeatedly. I will never go to the Alpine store again after the manager told me he was off the clock and "to Google" my problem...REALLY<//review></record></dataset><record>

Save yourself the aggravation, GoElsewhere. (pun intended)

I bought my iPhone 6 here, but their in-house network was so weak they could not restore my contacts. The next day I had 1/2 my contacts and no Calendar, so I called Brian (Manager) who offered to refund the $20 set up, which was offered for free then overcharged, but never received the credit. I have called 3 times and emailed twice, never getting any response.

What a pity, such a convenient location.<//Text>

This used to be a great store but in the past year they have had some turnover and the service is now terrible.  I was misinformed about the price of my phone on my edge contract ($7 v. $27), it took 2 hours to get a phone replaced and I discovered afterwards that my contacts weren't transferred over.  I had to go to another Verizon store down the hill who transferred my contacts in 5 minutes.  it might be convenient but it's not worth the trouble.< /review>

I had a great experience thanks to Yadira.  I came in over the holidays to purchase a new phone for my daughter. Yadira patiently took the time to review my bill and explain it to me. As a result I was able to purchase  two new phones for my daughters as well as get an upgrade for myself and my bill was hardly affected.   I was also able to trade in my old phones and purchase several necessary accessories. Yadira made sure my girls and I got the phones we wanted and made this a wonderful experience.  I will definately go back and see Yadira for any of my cell phone needs.<//Review>

Call me technology challenged, Its always a challenge trying to find a store that actually HELPS you and makes your experience enjoyable. I called into customer  care to find a  Samsung s7edge and they referred  me to the Alpine location. I called the store and was greeted on the phone by Brittany whom was right off the bat very helpful and knowledgeable about what I was looking for and what to expect when I came in today.
I was upgrading from a basic flip phone and she was so sweet and understand when it came to my lack of knowledge on understanding how to use the phone. She spent almost 2 hours with me on going over how to use it and  exploring all the different freatures of the phone after ensuring I was set up with a case and glass protector, going out of her way to help me choose a case online and have it sent conviently to my home. Im so amazed at how sweet and paitent she was with me.This girl deserves to hear what a great job she does, which is why I asked my daughter to help me write this review for Brittany to be able to see. Thanks again sweetheart I appreciate how much you did for me.< /Text>

Tried to return the travel pack purchased on line from Verizon. Nope - can't do that there. Must go to company store in Santee or El Cajon. The sales people say Verizon has no user manuals for cell phones sold via Verizon either. Sales of merchandize only, I guess.</Review>

Pluto’s is part of the UCD food life. If you go to UCD then you have had Pluto’s. There is a good variety of roasted meats including chicken, turkey, and beef. Plate combos come with a meat option and 2 sides ranging from hearty vegetables to french fries and mac and cheese. There are also fantastic salad options with sandwiches as well. This location has plenty of seating and lots of parking. There are some empty retail space around it so there isn’t much of a crowd as it used to be. The food is cooked well and is a fantastic option for a hearty meal. It is fairly priced given the quality and healthy portions. Great variety if options for everyone. Expect around $10-14 on average for an entree.</Text>

<review>This location has been here for over 20+ years and there's a reason for that.. it's the best Plutos out of all of them.

On a side note, they only offer "Main" salads. They got rid of the "side" salad option.<//review><userid>110540820103133785343< /userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Fantastic spot for a pit stop on our way home from Tahoe. We plugged our EV into the evgo charger in the parking lot and stopped in for a late lunch. The sandwiches were excellent, ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The kids enjoyed the brownie and tart desserts which had a home baked quality to them.<//text>< Pictures>

Excellent! Salads built in front of you with anything you want...add some great grilled flank steak...Friends had sandwiches they really enjoyed. I’ll be looking for Pluto’s again! They make food the way I make it.< /Review>

I feel like a rabbit (in the best way) when I eat here. If you're like me (too lazy to make a dang salad, on occasion), this place is excellent. I've tried most of the salad toppings and everything is always very fresh. My boyfriend says their tri-tip sandwiches are "amazing", though I can't personally vouch for them. The rosemary focaccia bread that is added to salad orders is very good. I always wind up wanting more than the seven toppings that come with a large salad order (and I'm never able to finish a large salad by myself), but wanting more of what you see at a restaurant is never a bad thing. Go here if you really like a tasty, filling salad.< /review>

<Review>Great salads and more.

Plutos has a large salad bar.  You select your size (small is more than enough for one person) and lettuce type, along with seven toppings.  I've always had good luck with the quality of lettuce and toppings.  They will offer your choice of steak or chicken to add also.  Turkey can be had on request.  The meats are hit and miss.  I usually just go for the salads sans the meat.

They also have sides like mashed potatoes with a gravy that is really good, and a sandwich bar in which they'll slice fresh turkey or tri-tip and make it into delicious sandwiches.

Logistics of ordering are a little confusing since the salad and sandwich and sides bar have separate lines.  People are unclear on how to behave if you are ordering from multiple locations and whether you have to stand in each line separately.

Overall good food and healthy, too!<//Review>< Pictures>

The service was really fast. I admis l was here when it was pretty empty, but the staff was super helpful since it was my first time here. You can order from little stations that each are a little different. That means a salad eater and a burger eater can both enjoy themselves here.< /Text>

I eat at Pluto's at least once a week if not more often. There isn't really another place in town where you can get super-customized salads so fast and so fresh. Yeah, you kinda really have to yell to get them to hear your order over the din of the place and sometimes there's quite a line, but I keep coming back for the good salads and steak ❤️<//text>

So sad. I wanted to love this place but the staff wasn’t warm or welcoming and the salad I ordered was swimming in dressing, missing two ingredients listed on the menu, and the chicken was gristly. I’ll stick with the amazing Davis Farmer’s Market and make my own salads!</text>

Food was maybe a 4 but service was lacking. Could’ve just been a one off experience but I don’t plan to return. Just passing through on the way home from Tahoe so they didn’t lose a customer or anything. Hope the lady was just having a bad day or something.< /Text>

<Text>SERVICE EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE. Make your own salad bar line was an awful experience. I asked for my first ingredient and then the server yelled “AND WHAT ELSE?” after each ingredient I said. I then asked if the bread had any eggs in it. The server angrily said she didn’t know because the bread wasn’t made there... (so much for fresh). After I asked her to check, she came out and yelled at me “ALL BREAD HAS EGGS IN IT!” I just looked at her and then walked away. This place is the worst location I’ve been to. The one in San Luis Obispo and SF are pretty good.</Text>< pics>

I love me some Pluto's...as a chef, it's the same kind of food that I like to create. Rustic and homey...warms the soul. There are some things I'd do different here, but the concept is great and I usually have no issue with the food. This is one of my favorite places as autumn gets closer and we get deeper into the season.< /review>

I had one of their salads and it was okay. The lettuce was a little wilted and soggy, but other then that it was fine. It was so loud in there that it was hard to talk to the person making my salad, but we worked through it. I liked that there was plenty of parking behind the building. It was also right off the highway which makes it easily accessible to most people.</Text>

Plutos is just an amazing place to eat at. What really blew my mind the first time that I came here was the way in which you ordered your food. You select from a menu that they have for you in the front and you go from station to station, picking out what you want to eat and they prepare it for you on the spot. They always have different specials each week and if you are a daredevil, then go ahead and pick something random from their weekly specials. Their prices MAY seem a bit too excessive but trust me, they pile food on your plate as if it will be your last meal of your life. Sometimes there is trouble finding a table since it is always packed but it doesn't take off too much of the general atmosphere that it creates. Definitely one of the best places to eat  in Davis, guaranteed.<//Text>

Great selection of fresh to order ingredients combined to create the meal of your choice. The different ordering style combined with a typical long line can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the food is worth the wait and learning curve.< /review>

<review>Been here a few times and everytime I end up feeling like I wasnt treated that well with rude customer service. I'd enjoy coming here a lot more if the staff was a little nicer. I'd be just as happy if not more, getting a prepacked salad from trader joes tbh. But the salad is fresh, and the hot food is okay at best.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>This place was horrible. The Beef in my sandwich was uneatable- like shoe leather, not exaggerating. I could not eat it. It was so tough it would of had to been eaten with a knife and fork. On top of that it tasted like OLD BEEF.

I went to the shop for the first time last night and got helped out right away. I forgot to ask for the name of the person who helped me but both staff members were really knowledgeable and attentive. They have a wide variety of products that can be difficult to find elsewhere. Overall great experience and will definitely be buying from this store. Thanks again guys 👏🏼< /text>

I heard of Body Goods from my Son whom is a huge fan of their products and customer service. Dell was very helpful and informative with what I was looking for. Although they didn’t carry the product I was looking for he recommended another product that will help me meet my needs.. thank you and your team brian and Tim for the excellent customer service and laughs.. my husband and I will definitely be returning.</Text>

Dell took his time to help us out and explain the differences between the selection of proteins and pre workouts.He didn't just make a sale he made a customer I will never shop any where else for my supplements.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg6l_mwlS1xcrjekoP95pRErSbvTk6I8RRLeVq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

I've been coming to Body Goods for the past year,
And has been the only place I've been getting my supplements from just because of their great prices and brands they carry as well as some of the newest stuff when it comes to the market.

Other than that the owners Del and Brian are super educated and Fitness and can answer any question that you might want to know when it comes to your health and fitness. Even if you don't buy anything stop in there and see what they have to offer.

Just picked up Gold Standard Whey for 49$ that's a steal !💪<//text>

<Text>Super helpful friendly and knowledgeable staff. Takes the time to help you out with your individual needs. A lot of nutrition stores kind of attend to more of the meat head types. I don't feel like this is one of those places. The products that were recommended were highly recommended on you tube. Seemed to have all the workout supplements you need for fitness and exercise. Testosterone, protein, meal replacement, pre workout, joint health, etc. They also have a rewards program. Prices are good.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Brian, Lexie and Tanner are the nicest people I've ever met at a nutritional shop. I've been coming here for almost half a year and seen many self improvements already. I highly recommend joining their fitness group. They give you tools and talk you through what you've been achieving and what you can do to improve. I've also met a ton of great people throughout the group. Love this place! Thank you Body Goods!<//Text>

I love coming here. I randomly stop by based on my needs and the products recommended have been CLUTCH. I don’t have much knowledge on supplements, so I really appreciate the time taken with me to explain the different products.
Wish I got his name, but the person helping me also took the time to tell me what else I can do to reach my goals. Thank you thank you thank you!</Review>

Body goods has always been the best place in the IE to get exactly what you’re looking for. You get that family vibe as soon as you walk in the door and they really know everything there is to know about any supplements you have questions on. Brian has always been there for me since the beginning with all of my goals/ needs when it comes to fitness, giving me the best advice and always steering me in the right direction, and no matter how much this place has grown you always feel like a part of the family with them.</text>

5 stars isn’t even enough for these guys. Deliser, Brian, Tanner... you guys are truly the most amazing human beings. Humble, knowledgeable and so SO helpful. The second you walk in, you’re welcomed. There are so many options, whether you are vegan, plant based, a pescatarian, a meat eater, need a snack(s), an energy drink, greens, vitamins, sport supplement advice... or you may just be starting your health & fitness journey and need advice. These guys will not let you down. Thank you!!!</Text>

What is there more say about Body Goods then - AMAZING!!!! This team has been so amazing! Everyone is very knowledgeable and is very willing to help anyone with questions. From my own personal experience walking into this store was life changing. I walked in looking for protein powder and walked out doing something bigger for myself by doing their Body Goods fitness program. Their fitness program is unlike any others that I have encountered. It has been an amazing experience focused on my own personal goals and full of support with getting pushed outside of my comfort zone. I'm on my 3rd around of doing their fitness program and I'm looking forward to the outcome & many more.</review>

<Text>I went in the store to ask questions about specific ingredients that I cannot consume. Brian and Del guided me to the perfect supplements that fit my criteria and I was confident that I had the safest and highest quality supplements available. Thanks to the technology in the store I was able to see exactly how much muscle, fat, and water weight I was carrying around. With this new information I was able to set a clear course of action toward my health goals. Their work out gear is pretty cool too.

This is my absolute favorite place to buy bangs! They always have every flavor. Brian is especially cool, he took so much time to explain different proteins and pre workouts and supplements to me the first time I went in, EVEN THOUGH I had already told him I was just thinking about it and I wasn’t ready to purchase yet!! Anytime I go in there, they know who I am a give a friendly hello, and they are never ever pushy. Thanks so much for all the help, I’ll be back to buy protein very soon!< /Review>

Great place!
Very helpful and knowledgeable of their products, diet and nutrition needs. Carry nice apparel as well.
Community oriented. The owner Del once volunteered his storefront as a place for my daughter’s Girl Scouts to sell cookies.

<review>I’ve been going to body goods for about a year now and every time the employees are helpful and knowledgeable on supplements and give good recommendations on what to buy depending on what your fitness goals are. They also have some great prices on products that even beat prices of them online especially on STEEL products. Im also a big fan of their rewards program they have im able to use my points to do in body scans or free shaker bottles and what not. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to buy supplements.< /review><user>109574083207370134467< /user>< name>

<Review>So I found body foods a few months ago and it was close to my house and decided to give it a try. Honestly since the day I walked in everyone treated me amazingly and they were not “salesmen” they only recommended products I wanted or needed. They have some of the top brands in the industry with trusted products and they have continued to add more. Plus their apparel is legit and fits perfectly. It’s a family there not just a supplement store! As a trainer/coach my mom is my client and they helped not only me but her in directing her to the right products...she has lost 12lbs in 12 weeks and they treat her SO WELL! I would recommend bodygoods to anyone and everyone!</Review><UserId.>109374474724845432453</UserId.></record>

<review>I can’t express enough how grateful I am for this place! When I first started working out, it was very intimidating for me. I wanted an extra push so I decided to go into Body Goods & was hoping that they’d have something to help. I was greeted by Brian, who took the time to get to know me, and truly understand my goals and frustrations with my current workouts. I could tell he didn’t care about the sale, but cared about me and my fitness journey. Fast forward almost 2 years and even when my workouts were inconsistent, one thing wasn’t; the support and knowledge I gained from Body Goods. They’re always introducing new products, different flavors of my favorite pre-workout drinks, giving me tons of samples to try, encouraging me to come back and let them know how I’m feeling about what I’m taking, and have even been an ear to listen to me on days when life is hard. Del and Brian are bringing something very special to the fitness world and I feel so lucky to have stumbled in here once upon a time. Thank you for always making me feel like part of the Body Goods family!!</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>What is there to say that hasn't already been said.
I've been going to Body Goods since they opened in 2016. This isn't your ordinary supplement shop. The customer service you get from these guys is unmatched, hands down. There hasn't been one question that hasn't been answered in my time going there, which to be entirely honest i's quite frequently.
Del, Brian, and Tanner have helped me along my fitness journey more than I can put into words. Their suggestions anywhere from the type of pre-workout I should be taking, the different types of protein I should be eating, whatever newest supplement is on the block, they have all made the hugest difference. Not to mention they do in-body scans to track your weight, body fat percentage, water weight, skeletal mass, the whole nine yards not that rinky dink stuff they do elsewhere.
Doesn't matter if you're just getting into weight lifting, prepping for your next competition, or just popping the store just to say what's up, you'll always be treated like family. These guys know how to make you feel at home and will always point you in the right direction the same way they did with me. Do yourself a favor, ditch the other guys and jump on the Body Goods team!<//review>< user>

<review>I've been coming here since i wanna say around when the first open'ish. When it was only ran by Del and Brian i didnt see anyone else there. When you walk in you feel welcomed, you are welcomed! And it makes you feel positive. They always give you the best vibes. They are extremely knowledgeable of ALL their products and i LOVE that because some other places are not like that. They have things suited for EVERYONES diet needs, from vegan to carnivore diets. I do keto and they provide products for that too, i wish they had more *hint hint* haha but i also love the fact they have CBD products. And boy they sure have a good variety of that CBD stuff. I love love love!!! The CBD bath bombs and the seasoning stuff.
I also enjoy that they have little events here and there, where venders come out and give you knowledge and samples. I couldnt ask for a better nutrition store. I recommend every one here. I know i have a friend out in fontana who will drive here for her needs too.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>109468916662194925338<//UserId.>< rating>

So I decided to go on and speak with them and I got help from Del ,looked up the product i wanted compared it with 4 other products to see which was closest to it, helped me select pre work out, over all good experience, definitely coming back ,,,👍👍</review>< UserId.>

<review>Best nutrition shop yet. Never could find Black Market anywhere until the day my better half showed me the light🦄... They have a full stock all day errr day. And new limited flavors every month. Also the service, im 5ft. So usually nobody can see me...but oh they spot me. But on a serious note, you walk into the store and they have a wide variety of supplements, gym wear and their just good people. To make things short, go stop by and try it out for yourself.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Litter not a problem, which was nice to see.
Also, the water seems to be potable as locals often come by and fill containers from the tap. Haven't seen any analysis of mineral content, so drink at your own risk.
I did notice however, to my great surprise, that they do not require clothes, just be non offensive to other users.  I suppose since it is on Federal land, and there us no law banning simple nudity, it's good to go.
Just politely ask other users of they would mind.
Ir at least remove suits once in water.

<Review>This is a true Oasis in the desert. The water varies between 108 and 106 degrees in the big pool, there is a smaller runoff pool that is only a hundred and 104 degrees. You will see a palm tree explosion next to the natural pool of hot water. There is a 14-day BLM area located only one and a half miles away. Aweome!</Review>< Pics>

The locals keep changing the location on Google so look up BLM hot springs LTVA and go to that location. Pools are hot but nothing much worse than a got tub.

Great times spent here on good evenings and late nights. Doesn't matter whether it's in a group, or by your lonesome, if you enjoy the great outdoors and jacuzzi-like activity under waves, (however small), this is the place for you. But they could use a rather LARGE mosquito net, some onsight bug repellent, maybe even clean up the swamp behind it, and supply toilet paper for the restrooms up the trail.</Text>

<review>If you are an avid Hot Springs soaker, you will find the location of his hot spring, a stone's throw from the busy interstate, and surrounded by long-term desert camping absolutely overrun by snowbirds, to be less than ideal. You will likely never find the place all to yourself, except maybe in the armpit of summer in the hottest part of day.

That said, you won't find a more convenient spot to soak if you are traveling along Interstate 8. The main concrete pool is clean, deep, and plenty hot, and the snowbirds keep the place nice and clean, typically.

this is not the hot spring of your dreams, but if you were driving on I-8, it'll do in a pinch…</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

If you're driving on the highway 8 and passed this spring you have already failed, BLM campers keep this spring sparkling fresh and are there to remind you to shower before getting in the spring ,which is provided . All Jolly happy friendly people fenced-in spring ,dogs not invited in the fence but still loved and able to be tethered in the shade</Text>

Its nice little hot springs. It has one main tub you stand in and smaller tub and slightly less hot. I am camping for free across the freeway. It is 2.1 miles or 4.2 roundtrip from my campsite. I would recommend to stop and see it for yourself. They have bathroom for changing. You can even take some spring water with have you container. Thanks for reading my review. God bless you all!😀😎👌<//Text>

The Holtville Hot Springs is a great place to come and relax and heal from some pain. There's two pools different temperatures and A shower type of spot you can rinse off in or just stand or sit the hot water coming out. This is a place my family and I have been coming back to for many years now.👍😃< /Text>

Yea that's a nice place. I like the shower. The pools are a little too hot and the poolwalls and floor questionable. This place is great for mild arthritis cause the water is so hot. The pressure is good but you will think twice about drinking it altho I did. The water is clean with a tad of sulpher  but the pressure is so great that if you fill your bottle at full blast it rips ferns or moss from inside the pipes.This area is sitting ona thin crust ona fault. There were mild earthquakes every  day. This crust ground is soft and you can only drive on packed or graveled areas. The people there at the time were your typical desert rats and snowbirds.< /text>

As others have already stated it soothes the muscles.  However, it can only help relieve  temporarily my multiple physical ailments.

I think that the name shouldn't read "Old Fogey Hot Springs."  That is because people of many different ages utilize it.That being said, I think the appropriate name: "Holtville Hot Springs."

Also, because since people of different ages utilize the Hot Springs, I would suggest that the B.L.M. might ought to put on their sign: No nudity; swim suits required (appropriate).< /Text>

What a Hidden Gem right off the I-8.  I saw this place on the map and decided to go check it out.  It's like a hidden Oasis surrounded by trees there are birds and other animals hanging out.  There's an area where you can soak in the hot spring water.  An awesome place to visit on your way to San Diego</text>

<review>Good for muscles and the bones. I had a bad shoulder where I had jammed it and I couldn't lift my arm up high without it hurting. My friends kept telling me to go out to the hotsprings that the water will heal it. So after 3 months and it hadn't gotten any better I have in and went. I'm not sure how but it must be miracle water cus about a week after going I went to raise my arm up at the drive thru and my arm didn't hurt so I started thinking about it and realized wen I came back from the hotsprings my arm was healed like a miracle. I highly recommend this place. Keep it safe and enjoy</review></record>

Great Hot Water but Old Fogeys can effect the quality of your experience. Often lots of Mirth which can severely affect your Zen Soak. Occasionally some BIG Mouth Woman complains about my loofah body scrub (soapless) but she thinks it is inappropriate, but it is a hot shower and the Water drains away from the small soaking pool. I am the best and Never do wrong! So come on scrub your body sans Soap! Enjoy!!!</Text>

<review>Lovely hot springs on BLM land. Free to use and 14 day free camping nearby. There is also an LTVA close to the springs. The people visiting are extremely nice and, if you like, talkative.

There's a lagoon area next to the springs. It's a beautiful little oasis. No swimming there, only in the concrete pools.

The rules are posted at the entrance. There's a curfew from midnight to 5am. The water is hot in the main pool and cooler in the secondary pool. We saw temperatures from 112 to 125. There are concrete posts to sit on to cool off.

At the top of the hill are vault toilets where you can also change. And trash containers are convenient outside the toilets.< /review>< Date>

Old Fogey Hot Springs,  also known as Highline Hot Springs,  is always a treat when in the desert.   While it is crowded with Snowbirds during the day from the adjacent campground,  at night it be quiet for soaking and contemplation.</Review>

Enjoyable place to go and relax, but there are usually very weird people there in the night who may be smoking, under the influence, or uncomfortable to be with for multiple reasons. The floors are covered in special tiles for people to not slip anymore, there are a set of rules listed for safety, and a police officer always comes by in the night to check if there is any illegal things going on. Try to avoid speaking with people. The snowbirds, Canadians, are the only people that are safe to speak with over the winter only. Remember to bring plenty of water, and something to cover you from the mosquitoes during the summer. Do not use the restrooms because they are filthy and unpleasant to smell. The pools are also cleaned every Tuesday.< /review>

My favorite car wash all around! They do 19.99 for a monthly pass. You can wash your car every single day of the month if you'd like with the pass! They rock..<//review>

I've bought a membership for one month and told the boss that I was going to sell that car. He promised to change the membership to the other car. I sold my car after 4 days and went there with my husband's car which I was going to use untill I buy a new one. They grabbed my receipt and told that they weren't going to  serve any more because I could change my car every day. They could change the membership to my new car and tell that I couldn't change it anymore. For me they are cheaters< /Review>

<Review>Great price for do your own wash. Machine cleaned everything.
Make sure to bring your own towl to dry all the leftover. Then you get the vacuum to clean the interior. Nice and cheap.< /Review>< Pictures>

For the price of 20 or even 30 let's say a month you are getting 1 wash per day for 30 days deal beyond deals!

One Sparkling clean wash and am always happy with it and free vac included is going to cost you more like 25 or more per 1 wash any place else!! Get real this is the best deal in the valley hands down!< /review>

Incredibly rude and pompous management. Seriously not worth the cheap price. My car looked way dirtier after the wash! I decided to get a car wash for fun and now have ended up actually needing a car wash because I can’t see out of my windows. The manager was not helpful, nor did he listen. Avoid the tyrant of the car wash world, don’t let that cheap price fool you!<//review>

The price is great less than a $1/day. The customer service is usually good except for the short chubby guy, he always looks grumpy. The day I came in, the wash I had was really bad, there was a lot of wax left over all over the car. I spoke to the chubby guy and requested that I go through again for a rinse, he said I am only allowed service once a day, which I find to be absurb since they advertise that their wash is UNLIMITED...REAL BAD SERVICE. I had to use the vaccuum to suck out the wax. The other 2 guys are always friendly, it would be nice for the chubby guy to be the same also...I guess this is asking a bit too much from him. I work at a nearby hospital and have referred a lot of friends, they've signed up for membership, now because of this one guy, I've stopped doing that...NO MORE REFERRALS FROM ME!!!!</text>

I can over the car wash 15 minutes before closing, tried to take advantage of the daylight  to clean out my car before going through the wash and an employee walked over to ask if I had a trash can at home. He didn't even ask if I was going to wash my car. Nice facility but horrible customer service.<//Review>

< Review>
I have tried here and Wishy Washy (down the street east on Sherman). For the same price, I much rather wash at Wishy Washy since Wishy is newer and more updated and the water jets are stronger and more generous. I only came here since I needed a wash and Wishy was doing some maintenance. Overall, Wishy is better</Review>

For 14.99 a mounts you can do unlimited amount of washing and it is very convenient for taxi and uber  drivers . Of course we have what we paid for . Some time they do not work because of mechanical failure , but overall it is ok.</Review>< Rate>

<text>Dont be fooled by their prices. So I am a monthly member here, paying $23/month for wash 1/day any day that they are open. On March 17, 2009 I went here during normal business hours at 6pm and they had closed down. Apparantely the machine broke down. The following day, March 18, 2009 I went again at 6pm and right when I was the next in line, the machine broke again. I and two other guys waited to see if they would be able to repair it and the Asst. Manager and another worker told us it would take 30 minutes. We all waited until 6:50 and they were unable to repair it, so I went to ask if we would get some sort of recompensation for the two days. The Asst. Manager told me that I would have to speak to his supervisor, who currently wasn't there. He said that his supervisor would call me the following day, on March 19, and he would either give me a portion refund or extend my month another two days or so. I didn't receive a call the following day. On March 20, 2009 I called them and spoke to the supervisor. He gave me some BS excuse for not giving me any recompensation. He told me that I should've came earlier when it was working. So I decided to not argue any more about the issue and I am sharing this with everyone to know what kind of "customer service" you would be getting if you ever have a problem here.<//text>< pictures>

Good seasoning and fast service. Many meat and drink options. Funny taqueros and good music. Mostly eat standing or in/on car. As authentic as they come.</Review>

$1.25 CASH tacos including lengua!! Cheapest lengua tacos ever!! Pretty good taco street food. They even have hand sanitizer pump.

Drinks are $1 for soda, water or horchata. Enjoyed the oil dipped tortilla too. Cheap, flavorful and worth it!!< /Text>

I’m not a member but I visited when my husband had a tennis tournament there. Seating was really nice! Sometimes at tournaments I have to sit so far away I can’t even see him play but their seating was right next to courts and shaded too. Very relaxing!< /review>

<Review>Best Tennis Club period. Courts are very well maintained and staff is really nice and professional. Justin is the best Tennis Pro a club could ever dream to have. They have great kids program and drop inns. Todd is the best Tennis Director, Hillary is so friendly in the office....then you have Jed, Eric, Kiril, Dima, Jake, Lap, Patrick and so many other pros and staff members.
They created a really great Tennis community for us in Sacramento.

Also, Pool, squash, racquet ball, ping pong...

I highly recommend you join this club with your family.</Review><username>Franck Soler</username>< pics>

We have been members for over ten years as our kids are on the rec swim team. I have been outside since last swim season so I was super surprised how they gave redone the outside area. Nice seating area, new gas BBQs, artificial grass, corn hole games. Very nice job. Looking forward to spring.<//Review>

This club has 5 pools and several tennis courts. The staff seemed pretty friendly, but be aware it's a pricey place to join. It's too expensive for me, but one is "paying for the experience of being a member," that's what I was told by staff.<//text>

An awesome club! They have everything you would like and more. I played tennis  here as a guest of one of the members at Rio Del Pro club, it is top notch. They have many tennis courts, which I love. Also, they have a heated lap pool and swimming pool, hot tub, sauna, racquetball court, weights, and other amenities. A little high for membership, but they offer great deals once in a while. I would recommend to all...</review>

Everyone is really friendly, it's always so clean and I don't have to worry about any 'gym smell'! Due to the fires (I have COPD) we haven't been able to get on the courts just yet, but really looking forward to some tennis soon! The last time I played tennis here was for a tournament 25 years ago and the place still looks amazing!! And I LOVE the two American Flags at the entrance! <3< /review>

<Review>It's a wonderful club!  Lots of amenities: heated pool, tennis courts, etc.  Parking is an issue and the group workout rooms are small so it limits who can participate.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809adaf8d885ebdd:0x351a572113b9c257< /gmap_id></record>

Family friendly vibe. My 16 year old son has been with Rich Andrews Junior tennis academy 3 years now. Each year seems to get more intense. His game and strength have improved tremendously. Thank you Rio, and all Academy Coaches who make it possible for him.< /text>

If you like tennis this is the place for you.  The kid's club is also full of plenty of things for the kids to do.   They've got plenty of lap pools as well.  It's a nice place, just a little too waspish for me.< /review>

It is the best you can get. Like Laguna Creek, Broadstone, Johnson Ranch, Park Terrace, Rollingwood, etc. are nothing compared to Rio. The tennis, swim, and fitness programs and coaching here are amazing. They have highly trained staff with many years of experience. The staff and coaches are really nice. It is a great environment there. I love it and I gurantee you will too. Ditch those other clubs and come to Rio. I gurantee you won't regret it. Let's go RIO!</Review>

Went for the Covid shot. It was Awesome. I parked at 1255pm and went to get the shot was back in my car by 130pm. This event is set up very well. Line looks long but moves really fast. Lets see if the 2nd shot goes as smoothly. Thank you Santa Clara County!😁< /review>

Very efficient. Lines move rapidly. Check ins are quick and easy. I moved directly to the inoculation station. Valley medical administers the vaccine with a 2 cm needle. I didn't feel even a poke. Perfect vaccination.
I recommend this site for their organized effort. I had no side effects.<//Review>< name>

Excellent expirience for both injections. Very quick, efficient, keep and and helpful. I never had an instant if frustration, pain, sickness or inconvenience. The whole process took less than 30 minutes both times including the 15 min observation period. Go get vaccinated.</Text>

Great place to get covid vaccination. The setup is well staffed and reminds me of the ride lines at Disneyland. But watch out for the massive divit in the dirt parking lot, its a doozy, especially if you have a small car like my Prius. And for kicks, there's a cardboard Dr Fauci to take pictures with. 🤣< /Text>

DO NOT DRIVE HERE IF YOU HAVE A LOW SUSPENSION CAR. We didn't know about it, but you will just kill your car on their NOT asphlted long road full of rocks. The testing itself was fast, but if you have a low suspension car it's much better to get tested at a different location in the area.< /review>

It is very interesting place for teens and adults. You can spend several hours here because there are at least 5 maps where you can play various types of games.
We've played medic, president, castle etc.
Instructors are very careful about your safety. They can always offer you more scenarios.

There are many parking lots available.
There is no need to wait in line, you are starting game as soon as you are ready.<//review>

Attended the model train show in March. Parking across the street was ok. Building was ok. Being charged $4.50 at the ATM was total joke. The city is making a bundle on that. Overall experience was simply ok.</Text>

<text>Not worth the money spent at all. The dinosaurs were made nicely and were in fact very lifelike and big, but the whole experience was not what was expected. The mechanical baby dinosaurs were pretty cool and so was sitting on the big dinosaurs but that was about it. Arrive as early as possible so your not stuck waiting in long lines. Definitely over priced unfortunately because it was something we were really looking forward to.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808e32fc62392ed5:0x219f4c88363a8d57</gmap_id></record>

<Text>The SCC Fairgrounds holds a special place in my heart. Many childhood memories with family and friends. So glad that I’m able to bring my kids to this yearly event. This year my daughter is entering her artwork!!

I especially love the community exhibits, artwork, performances and animals.  The outdoor music shows and rides give it such a fun summer vibe.  And the variety of food is oh so wonderful- creamed corn, steak sandwiches, funnel cakes, cinnamon rolls...Yum!   Cleanliness and availability of public restrooms is a key factor to me and they are doing a good job with this.   I hope it continues to grow in popularity and support while keeping it safe for all to enjoy<//Text>< Rate>

What a dump the city of San Jose is not providing quality spaces for smaller or medium events. Parking in the dirt but San Jose fairgrounds 5 minutes from downtown?
Where is the redevelopment funds going? More importantly where is the billion+ dollars in property tax money going? It certainly not in the public school system. State scores for San Jose are low or barely passing.
Silicone valley place of the greatest minds and education is below average.<//text>

Staying at the RV Park. The woman in charge of the park is very kind and informative. She's johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to organizingthe RV's whether they are trailer or self driven into the slots that is convenient for them. The rates are very good and we are enjoying our stay here. The neighbors around us are friendly & helpful as well. It was a nice reprieve from driving across country from Florida to come to a place that welcomed us immediately!! 😊😊🙂< /text>

Every time I visit this place, I want to like it. Unfortunately, the place is run down and badly in need of repair and upkeep. The parking lot is broken down and confusing, parking rates are high. The grounds at the fairground are old and ignored. Surely they can generate for business for themselves being in the heart of silicon valley if they spend money at keeping the place up.</Text>

<Review>Terrain Race was held there. Advertised as a 5k run (actually about 2.75 miles according to my GPS watch) with mud and obstacles was fun but not up to par with the more popular mud runs. No overhead monkey bars or rings to swing from but walls to climb over and a heavy tire to flip. Overall a decent intro to obstacle runs.< /Review>< Pics>

A sad fair, the organizers utterly failed and I don’t even want to give 1 star, but I’m forced otherwise I can’t post this.
Santa Clara County is one of the most profitable counties in California because we are ground zero for the high tech industry, such as Google. I/we went to the fair last night and was shocked by the lack of actual county representation. The ‘County Fair’ should show case the bests of the county.

The fair is literally the worst fair I had ever been to in my life, we were there Friday from 6-8pm. We left out of sheer boredom.

1.) The main entrance advertisement sign that’s supposed to be facing the street is actually backwards, so u don’t know what’s even going on in there if u drive by.
2.) Stage highlights: square dancing & Vietnam dancers - this was the highlights. That’s it for Friday Night.
3.) The approximately 10k sq ft art building had no climate control, so it was really hot and had stale air - not a single person in the art building.
4.) The location is the area where 99% crime and murders happens in Santa Clara County. Why is this the location for the County Fair? That makes no sense at all.
5.) The sheep and rabbits were cool, but then there were several cages with fake chickens in the FFA/4H chicken area. Why would we want to see fake animals in the live animal area?

As far as the rides, etc. it reminded me of being in a fly by night cheap carnival.

I conclude, I/we will never go back it’s just not a true snapshot representation of beautiful Santa Clara.<//Text>

A big ground, lot of events, paid parking space but you can still find cheaper/free parking nearby area if you're willing to walk for 10 mins.< /Review>

Why doesn't the RV park person answer the phone? They only text? That seems weird and unprofessional. If the park is closed due to construction and the manager isn't doing much, why can't they answer the phone. Many people don't text. I prefer not to as well
I can just picture this manager sitting on the couch watching TV ignoring phkne calls and texting everyone so they don't miss the price is right! 😂🤥
Oh and $25 to dump? Lol. Ridiculous.<//Text>

We only saw the area where they had the Cirque du Soleil tent sent up, but we had a great time at the show and they did a great job setting up the event. It was easy to forget to you were at a fairgrounds. We were able to walk from our hotel and save $20 on parking, but there did seem to be plenty of parking unlike our local fairgrounds. I would definitely keep an eye out for more events here in the future.< /review>

We have been coming to the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds the past 3 years for the Island Reggae Festival.. love, everything about IRF.. the food, entertainment, meeting new people, the vendor's and of course the  music. I like the fact that the performers walk around and interact with their fans by taking pictures and signing autographs... can't wait until IRF 2019.<//text>

Fair grounds are what they are. This one does have ample space but probably it was the event that saw visitors paying astronomical parking charges. It is a huge lot though right across the road so convenient.< /review>

We saw Volta there and the show was absolutely and breathtakingly amazing. Five of us went and took one car. approaching and getting into the park was fairly easy parking was a little bit difficult even though I am disabled. However the big disappointment was after the show when we were trying to get out. It was almost impossible to get out of the parking lot because of the haphazard traffic directions. That was one person directing traffic from every witch Way and people were getting impatient after about 40 minutes.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I'm 3 years new to the area having moved down from the NW.  I was really looking forward to taking in a local fair having not been able to the last couple of years. Went 8/2/15 and arrived about 20 minutes early thinking that it had opened at 10am - didn't open till 11am.  What an experience.  Security lined women up in one line and men in another in front of the gate. I've never seen this done before in America. I felt like I was in a Nazi camp.  I even saw small children cry because there dad had to go in the men's line nowhere near his family like the rest of us.  This is supposed to be a family event! Unheard of!  This fair is VERY small and I knew that, but the lack of participation by the community as witnessed by the incredibly small displays in photography, art, food, and vendors and everything else you would expect in a fair made this place worthless.  The only thing that was enjoyable was the lack of crowds. Obviously the locals have been here before and know not to come back.</Text>

Good to have the faire back.  Enjoyed the pepper steak and the Phillies steak.  The smoked turkey leg was good and worth the price.  Don't bother with the foot long corn dog.  Definitely not worth the price.  The corn bread covering the skinniest hot dog I have ever seen was tough!  The kids enjoyed it though.  They liked seeing the small animals as the large animal barn was closed.  Enjoyed the sea lion exhibit for both the show and the valuable information.  They rode  the ponies, petted the animals and had a great time on the bungee jump.  Spent a great deal of time and energy on the walk on water attraction. They enjoyed the carnival rides and went on some some more than once.  They played the games and were treated well by all the people working the rides and games.  It was a good time had by all.  The kids were exhausted at the end of the day!< /Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>It is a Fantastic piece of land that allows many versitile functions to be realized.  The fairgrounds is basically a large dirt field which allows for the wind to blow dirt throughout the air, which is most unpleasant to breath in.  I realize CA has been in a state of drought which handicaps many possibilities,  still landscaping upkeep would be an excellent wise investment to keep most of the dirt from being kicked up and inhaled, as well as making the grounds safer to walk by eliminating uneven ground & holes along the walkways.  Iv seen Brilliant low/no water landscaping that could improve that great space of land.
Look forward to seeing the grounds become beautiful.<//text>< Name>

Went here for the first time to the South Bay VegFair. It was awesome. There's a lot of shade and the bathrooms are clean with a lot of stalls. Lots of benches to sit. If the crowd was bigger it might've been harder to find a spot to sit but the crowd was light enough to be able to move around and find good spots to hang out. Nice lawn and trees cool the area down nicely.< /Review>

<review>This will seriously be a handful of the LAST fairgrounds left in the Bay Area. As land becomes valuable and land owners get greedy, these venues will disappear.

Jurassic quest Salinas one. It was awesome!  Not huge lines. Face painting employees were so nice to my daughter it was her first time. Tons of dinos and lots of info. The rides were so fun for both my kids and so many activities!  A must! Make sure to get the VIP.pass for the kids!< /Text>

The guy at gate B pavilion is super rude, there is no sign in the parking lot at the front saying that is for handicap, he followed me all the way since I entered and forced me to leave that parking lot within one minute. There were plenty of non-handicap cars in that parking lot, including my friend’s parking there, and he did not do the same to them. FIRE THAT GUY PLS
And I will never go again!!</review>

It would be irresponsible of us to ask for grants or donations because who knows if the land would even be available before we got through planning, permitting, building, etc.! We are pushing for a 15 year lease by the end of the year that will allow us the time to fix these problems and put the fairgrounds back on the map.'}< /resp><time>1542231026875< /time><text>Needs a coat of paint and a thorough cleaning.

It was okay, no walking Dino's as advertised. However, the children loved it. 10 year old boy's may get bored of this attraction within 30 minutes. The Nacho's are excellent.< /review>

We went to see Train Show.  The parking was confusing as there was no sign pointing to Train Show parking lot.  We got there early so the parking lot looked empty/closed.  Figured it out though.  The model railroad setups were nice with some of them having push button controls for kids to control small details.  At least half the floor was shops selling pricey trains and landscapes and figures.  Looked like good stuff for the otaku crowd.  Too fancy for nubes.  Outside was a bounce house and ride on train ride (must buy tickets).

Tickets were $10 for adults and kids free.  A search will find a $1 off coupon code.  Parking was $10.< /Text>

We went to see Bernie Sanders.  He was great, but poor parking & putting the rally at the back of the grounds made thousands walk miles on dirt roads to get to the venue.  Not well done, SC Coubty.  Bernie was worth it!</review>

<text>Every time im there i have an experience not worth going back. I dont even want to comment because of bad memories but i will.
1. Bubble Run- Why on EARTH would you have a bubble run through the mud and not allow us to use the water to hose ourselves off before getting into our vehicles?? And WHY was there no security to make sure nobody drowned trying to move past the people standing in the bubbles taking selfies??

2. Dinosaur Tour- You have an amazing publicist. That event was horrible!!! For it to be so expensive, all there was were stationary dinosaurs that hardly moved. The T-Rex literally opened and closed its jaws.. That's it!!
The commercials made it seems as though it would be some life-changing eye opening experience. It was a complete let down.
And to top it off, there were things to do like the virtual reality, basketball hoop, balloon pop, face paint, etc. BUT they cost 1 ticket each person. Get this, the tickets were $5 Each. For my 4 kids to get their faces painted =$20! Such a rip off.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>2< /Rating><user_name>Deja< /user_name><time>1522738358807<//time>< response>

It would be a shame to see it go, but maybe the best thing for the townies and their thieving pockets to sell the land and be done with the fair grounds.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><user>102268507453790345992</user>< GmapID>

This place is big enough to host large events. It also has a covered place to hold internal events. However, the parking is opposite to the event center.< /Review>

It was the South Bay vegfest. It's the 2nd annual, so they're still working to get this off the ground. The entrance was for two events: vegfest and miniature house convention. It was confusing which was which, because they were right together. They should have divided the exhibits better.<//review>

What a sad scene. I Can't believe that this is so depressing of a fair in the middle of silicon valley. So much disposable income here and the promoters can't even get decent food in the event. ALL the food was so bad. Very little attendees. So disappointing.<//review>

1. After waiting in long queue for parking they asked for $10 cash, I had to find cash from near by 7eleven and join the queue again.
2. The food festival was a scam, they didn't allow us to enter the venue even with pre-paid tickets of $10 each. How can they allow such event!!!
3. By the way there are big pot holes in the parking lot and they are almost invisible on a rainy day.

Can't think of going there for some other event as well.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Must pay for parking and I went for a train. Show which was 40% about selling train and wagons that was expensive. I was desappointed because we had pay for seeing miniature train not to buy 50$ a wagons train. Also, the event was talking about bouncing house which was also an E. At the end, not such a good experience of this expensive place.<//Text>

The fairgrounds are really hurting for renevation. Just fixing up the facilities like the front gates, ATM hutch, bathrooms, and parking lot would really make this place more appealing to go to.</text>

Went here for the Lunar New Year. It was a pretty disappointing experience due to the lack of things to do and the size of the event compared to many years past. Not worth the $10 to enter.</Text>

Lots of events. They have a lot of space for races and shows, however not much shade. So if you are out there during the day, bring sunscreen!</text>

{'time': 1542320057907, 'text': 'Hi Michael! Thanks for leaving us some feedback. We agree that we need a fresh coat of paint and a thorough cleaning. For the last 15 years, we have been receiving 1 to 3 year leases on the property. It would be irresponsible of us to ask for grants or donations because who knows if the land would even be available before we got through planning, permitting, building, etc.! We are pushing for a 15 year lease by the end of the year that will allow us the time to fix these problems and put the fairgrounds back on the map. If you would like to help us turn the ship around, we are always looking for volunteers :)'}</Resp>

This is an ugly setting for the 5k's they host there.  Nothing to look at, super hot and there is tons of large rock like gravel on the ground.</Text>

Parking for events is across from the fairgrounds. Enter on Tully side. Parking lot is also not in the best shape. Lots of loose gravel and potholes.<//Review>
