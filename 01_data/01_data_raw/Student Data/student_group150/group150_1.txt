The cannabis business has been taken over by the MBA types. Who are only interested in the bottom line.  Nicole is old school with heart and soul. It’s a blessing  to know her.<//review>

BayQueen was fast, efficient and had a great selection. The delivery driver was incredibly patient and helpful.

Our usual delivery spot was out of the brand we like and BayQueen was the closest delivery that had it in stock so we took a chance. It’s now going to be our go-to!

Highly recommend! 😉< /text>

<text>My favorite dispensary! Ordering on their site is super easy, delivery is usually free and very fast with good communication and tracking, AND it's a black woman owned business! Excellent products and pricing too, with cute personalized packaging and lil extras like stickers and rolling papers. Highly recommend to all Oaklanders!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1615606610078< /time><Review>I was dogsitting my brother's puppers and she was anxious about being in an unfamiliar place and also had an irritating ear infection. My brother recommended CBD. I found BayQueen carried pet CBD especially in tincture form which I heard good reviews about. I placed an order about ~10-15 min before closing time. I thought they would process my order the next morning which was fine and I was expecting that. But they went above and beyond and called me immediately after I placed my order to see if they wanted my order now or they can deploy the first thing tomorrow morning. They also take credit card so I didn't have to hunt down an ATM in my neighborhood to take out cash.

When they delivered, they were prompt and used a tracking app that tells you where your driver is at. Driver was polite and I met him on the curbside. Simple and fast. It also came in a cute bag! Also BayQueen is a women-led business! Go support them. :)<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

<review>I’ve ordered twice so far and plan to order again. If they’re out of something you order online they’ll give you a call to try to find an alternative product. I also live a decent distance from Oakland so I was surprised they’d even deliver to me! The drivers are very nice as well. I’m definitely happy to support this business and I recommend it.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Love that every delivery bag has a personalized Thank You as well as the colorful and pretty mesh bags used to hold the products in the delivery bag. Staff are very prompt to notify you items you ordered were out of stock. All delivery drivers have been a pleasure to interact with!</text>

Only gotten deliveries, but all the drivers have been super nice and informative about their products. Called a couple of times since I was new to the whole cannabis scene, they're spot on for your needs.</Text>

We got in a pinch when our dog ran out of his Vet Tincture during shelter in place - we were worried about his pain and seizures coming back. BayQueen not only delivered but delivered in a flash. Our driver was professional and kind. Everything they do at BayQueen is done with professionalism and kindness. Just the best.</Review>

What distinguishes BayQueen Delivery is how they handled themselves when there's a problem.  And they knocked it out of the park!  I had a cartridge go bad. It was late when I notified them of the problem so we agreed to exchange the cartridge the following day. No only did they exchange the cartridge, they added a little bonus for the delays. I would absolutely recommend BayQueen Delivery!</review></record>

My experience with BayQueen Delivery was awesome! They were quick and courteous on the phone, and my delivery driver called ME to apologize about an issue with the order tracking I didn't even know I had. And to top it all off, my order came wrapped up in the cutest package ever!

Tl;DR Best service ever, 10/10, would 100% use them again!< /Review>

Great fresh hand tossed pizza for an even better price. The cheese was top notch unlike that Domino's and Pizza Hut stuff.

A year ago they would've gotten 5 stars.  I don't know what's happened but the last 2 or 3 times I called they were out of what I was trying to order, even salad!  Tonight they're not even answering the phone, it just rings & rings.  Sad, they used to be really good.

Waited a few months and decided to try again and guess what?  No answer so I drove over there.  Closed and door all chained up.  Safe to say I won't be trying again.< /review>

<text>It's been a while since I been in Pacifica pizza, I went in the place for the first time in about 6 month, I ordered a large veggie pizza with sausage , I took the pizza home, me and my kids were amazed how good the pizza was,, a 100 time better than before the new owner took over., even the girl working at the counter was friendly...I will definitely  be a repeat customer...great pizza and good price..< /text></record>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I'm staying in a hotel nearby.  The person who took the order over the phone also delivered the pizza.  That's relevant because they didn't bring any plates or napkins, knowing the person ordering was staying in a room without either of those things.  They use chopped black olives...? Presumably to save a few nickels on the gallon-sized cans they should be ordering.  As evidenced by the photo (in the photo section) of my sausage and black olive pie, it looks rather unappetizing.  Like someone spit a bunch of chewed up olives all over my pizza.  Lastly, the delivery person forgot to bring the soda I ordered from them personally over the phone.  That alone wouldn't have been a big deal (everyone makes simple mistakes like that) but they refused to take responsibility. Rather, they blamed it on the person who assembled the order for them.

To end on a positive note, despite its appearance, the pizza actually did taste good. Overall quality (appearance aside) I'd place at just above average.<//Text>< name>

Pizzas really good here the only compotition  is me n eds. I order every few weeks and its always good. Only one time I orders some cheese bread that was under cooked but that's 1 out of 50 times. Only thing is you can't dine in and the service is very rude at times. kinda sucks since I order very often.< /text>

< Review>
I called to order a pizza. When they answered  The girl said in a rude voice helloooooo like she was annoyed.
I thought I had dialed the wrong number.  I thought I accidentally called somebody’s personal cell phone or home because she did not say Pacifica pizza may I help you then she states abruptly we’re closing in seven minutes. My thing is if you don’t want to work Then you shouldn’t be there.  Some people are so rude and disrespectful. I just don’t get it why are you there if you were not happy. You are working at a business you should always be professional and respectful and answer the phone in a professional manner.
Too bad people like this make me go somewhere else.< /Review>

Its really small but that's not why i gave it the stars i did. It was the customer service. I get there and a customer was before me and one after me. The one before me was talked to very nice and fast service for him too. Then it was my turn or so i thought cause as i stepped up to say my order im cut off by the cashier reaching out her hand like she was expecting payment from me. I was like what? But it turned out i was just invisible or something because the guy behind me hands his card over the cashier and looked at me like i was the one cutting in line. Not cool i stood there for 10 mins they got his order done and took another 5 or so mins arguing about who is gonna take my order cause they had something else they needed to do. The one who took my order was very rude told me i could only order from a small selection on the menu and it was the most expensive ones of the menu. None the less i ordered a pizza that cost me a whopping 31.00 bucks plus i had to take it home to bake it myself. Wow so never going there again.< /text>

This is a local favorite, or at least in my opinion. Order that funky chunky chicken pizza, it's perfection!</review>

This place has screwed up three orders in a row on me in past. Tonight I decide to try them again. It's Wednesday night not a busy Friday but when I call to order they say it's going to be 2 hours before I can get a pizza delivered! Seriously!?<//text>

My family and I have been taking our cars to get a smog check done for years now at Ruiz Smog Test Only. They are always ready to help and get the job done efficiently with a professional attitude. Reasonable pricing definitely would recommend.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Was recommended to me. I drove from the city of Tulare. I had a great experience! Josh, the smog tech, took care of me and he was very professional and provided prompt service.  First impression was a clean shop and a smile from Josh.  I have automotive experience and a lot of other smog places I have gone to try to do more than one thing at a time. He gave me and my vehicle his undivided attention. He inspected my car and tested it. I was in and out as it should be. After he finished he went over the results and highlighted the good of my emissions results but also the things I should keep an eye on.  It's my new favorite spot to bring my vehicles, even if I have to drive from Tulare. Definetly recommend this place!!!!< /Text>< Pics>

These guys are the greatest. We moved into the area just a year ago and I've been here twice with two different vehicles.  Both times the service was quick, friendly, and exactly as advertised. The only caution I have to offer is that the waiting area is a few lawn chairs at the side of the shop. It can get a bit breezy. Also, if an older car is running on the test equipment there may be fumes, but the space is open to the outside.
It is a father and son operation. They both know their business and complete their work efficiently without being brusque. This is going to be my smog check regular shop from now on.</Review>

Ruiz Smog is a family owned and operated business. They have performed smog checks on all our companies and family vehicles for almost 10 years. I highly recommend them as they are real professionals who pride themselves on their work. The service is first rate and the cost is reasonable. Thank you Ruiz Smog.</review>

<text>This shop is great!

I've taken my truck and several cars to them over the last few years and not one has failed a smog test.

Another shop in town told me I needed hundreds of dollars in repairs which is why I went to Ruiz's smog only shop in the first place.

Funny thing but it turned out my vehicle didn't need any smog repairs at all and it passed with flying colors the first time at Ruiz's. Simple mistake by the other smog shop or a greedy rip off?

Ruiz Smog was also fast and the had the test done when they said they would.

I think they are probably more honest also becasue they only do smog checks and not repairs. The have no incentive to rip you off.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Words are not enough to express what a exceptional work both Francesca & Irene did.
After 2 long years of being denied I got approved. Full favorable benefits including back pay. Due to long distance, no driver & COVID I never had the chance to meet them personally, but it wasn’t necessary very responsive on phone calls, Email response within minutes.True professionalism I am beyond grateful. I will recommend them to anyone in need.
Thank you so so much! KP</text></record></dataset><record>

An Internet Application was completed for us by The Law Offices of Irene Ruzin. They helped us to file a SSDI claim and we were awarded benefits the first-time-through the claims process. We did not need to make an appeal. We consider their expertise to be outstanding.</Text>

Irene and her staff were outstanding.  Facing disability is a difficult position to be in.  Irene and her staff made the process of applying and subsequently being rendered a fully favorable decision of SSDI easier for me.  They were with me every step of the way and were always available for questions.  Their professionalism was evident from beginning to end.  I would recommend the Law Office of Irene Ruzin without question.<//text>

We had a great experience. Irene represented me as we went into the hearing and it took the Judge only 15 minutes to render me a fully favorable decision. Irene was professional and very concise. She helped me understand what we were walking into and I felt confident with her as my representative. She worked our case the entire time. The wheels of justice will put you to the test in the pure slowness of the claim period. Know that Irene will get you to the end. I hope this little review helps you in choosing her. She was recommended by two other friends of mines that used her successfully.< /Review>

<Review>Irene Ruzin provided excellent representation for my SSA Disability claim. My claim was accepted thanks to her diligence and attention to detail. I am pleased to say that I was not just a "Client," but a "Person." Anyone struggling with a disability claim will understand how important that is.

I would highly recommend her for representation.<//Review><user_id>107409840010973236868< /user_id>< username>

Irene Ruzin Law Office for Social Security benefit supports are excellent, professional, and A plus services and support.   Irene herself and the whole crew are excellent during initial walkthrough process, very responsive to phone calls and emails, keep providing status update and never over promise.   I have been through social security benefit process couple of years and I don’t see any match, based on my experience, with Irene Ruzin Law Office.   I strongly recommend you start with her office as a first and last that wasting time with others.   All said, I have nothing but, good to say about her support and its outcome.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1590155647391, 'text': 'Khosrow - Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

<text>Irene Ruzin was highly recommended to my mom for help with the social security disability appeal process.   From day one, Ms Ruzin was outmost compassionate, professional and extremely well versed.  This includes her staff as well.  Ms Ruzin turnaround time to respond to questions and concerns was amazing, and rare in the industry.  She was patient and explained each step of the process, so my mom was at ease.   She consistently kept my mom updated.  Ms Ruzin representation of my mom's case at the appeal court proved to prevail and she secured my mom's SSD benefits.
Ms Ruzin!  Thank you so much for making my mom feel as she was your one and only client.  My mom is very very grateful to you!!!< /text><rate>5<//rate><user>106505452149453729401< /user></record></dataset><record>

My son Danial is relieving  SSI benefits because of the hard working, intelligent and caring, Irene Ruzin Esq.  If anyone can win a case it's Ms. Ruzin. She will find any opening in the system and break threw, then she will continue to care about the client even after the case is over. I can't say enough good things about her as a lawyer, and as a human being, with great maternal instincts.

We used Ms. Ruzin a few years ago for our daughter to get her on disability because she had MS and is very much disabled.  She had been denied by Disability originally.  Ms. Ruzin appealed and won her some disability help.  Ms. Ruzin is very organized, efficient, ethical and knowledgeable and experienced at what she does and has good analytical skills.  She made the process very easy for my daughter, and we highly recommend her to anyone who has the same problem and needs to appeal.<//review>

My SSDI was just approved  in 03/2019  with  SSD attorney Irene Ruzin ! She is perfect to have helped me win so complicated disability case!  She Is Just Like Judge Judy to me! If you do need a SSD attorney,  just  post your case in details to her website, follow her what to do /not to do for your medical record & update,  great  chance  is in her hand for you! Don't waste your time ! Don't miss her! A  Big Thanks To All Of Office Team Irene/ Ann/ Vickie/ Maria!!</Text>

If you want a lawyer who won't listen to you, won't prepare properly, will arrive late, and then misinform you, Irene is the lawyer for you.  I'd give her zero stars, but ya can't.  She's a complete screw-up.< /Review>

<Text>Do Not use this firm if you want positive results! Despite verbally explaining to Irene and her staff and jointly going over the case materials the staff was continually clueless going forward with our case including not knowing any information prior to going in to court appearance. We were forced to do all of the paperwork and filings our self on HER behalf because her office was not sending in the information that the courts were requesting. This firm is completely clueless and will waste years of your time.<//Text>< username>

<Text>We had a dispute over earnest money.  Commissioner Connally heard our case in Small Claims Court and found for us, the plaintiffs.  Then Fontana Court dropped the ball and did NOT get the necessary paperwork out to all parties so that the defendant could mount an appeal in a timely fashion, if she wished. So, the judgment for us was set aside and after the defendant appealed the decision, we had to have a new trial. This second time in court was with a young (seemingly thorough) judge. This judge read the fine print on our sales contract concerning dispute resolution and decreed that we had to Arbitrate to solve our dispute and she could NOT rule on the matter.  UNFORTUNATELY, she FAILED to read the next paragraph where it covered Exclusions to having to Arbitrate, which included ANY matter that is within the jurisdiction of a probate, small claims or bankruptcy court!!  (We unfortunately did not see this paragraph until after we left the court.)  We had been told by a Real Estate Broker that we could accomplish arbitration by going to small claims court, but the judge disputed this. So, after two 1/2 day court appearances in Fontana, we are no better off than when we started!   What a disappointing waste of time and money for ALL concerned!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1592675899995<//Date><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Tammy Teel-Thompson</username><text>I had a fixit ticket & at my due date in Feb, still couldn’t get my car fixed as no auto shop (3 diff shops) could figure out my smog issues.  So I was given an extension til May.  The staff was courteous & organized.
Then Covid hit, I finally found a shop that fixed my issue & my car passed smog. I got my DMV registration completed & my license plate sticker 2020.  But since all court services were closed,  I didn’t return to Courthouse until yesterday (June).  They had lines taped inside & outside for social distancing, MANDATORY MASK in building,  plenty of personnel to guide you to the correct line & find out what you were there for & then direct you again to correct area inside courthouse.   The service was quick & courteous & helpful.  FYI...I was told all tickets had automatically been given an extension (whew...was worried about a penalty).  All the staff acted like they cared & were doing their best to get your problem solved fairly.

I was impressed.  A huge difference since my last interaction with that courthouse for traffic ticket 5 years ago!!  Back then there was apathy, rudeness & no one directing anyone.<//text><rating>5</rating>< gmap_id>

The court is fine but it's definitely understaffed. If you're planning to go in and out from here then you got it all wrong. I recommend going to the express window outside for any traffic tickets. The workers get to the point so that everything runs smoothly. I personally don't complain over my tickets which let's me pay off my mistakes and as long as you have the right documents to fix it then you'll be fine coming to this court.<//Text>

<Text>Well what can I say, not very happy to be here because I got a ticket and need to be here for court, this court is clean and has an electronic log with names making it really easy to find your name up on the board, this court is clean and the service is fast I was in and out in less than an hour, the only issue I had is that my schedule appointment was there for eight o clock and they didn’t start until twenty minutes later but they were quick with the delivery.</Text><name>Hugo Martinez< /name>< Date>

With all the money they make from tickets themselves you would expect it to be clean. This location is a joke! The floors are all stained walls have stains the whiteboards weren't cleaned right. There was no respect for the place where these people work. I've seen public schools cleaner than this it was absolutely disgusting... In the court room they couldn't even find the time to separate the flags an equal distance from the middle...<//Text>

@Manuel Venegas-Here's a thought, you can always not pay and instead opt out by going to jail. Here's an even better thought. Try not breaking the law and they won't be asking for your money. Ever thought about that, genius?</Review>

<text>This court house is not regulated by law.  It is regulated by judges who do exactly what they want and determined how they feel that day.

Sat there for four hours, came back two different days at the judge's request.  Each time to get a different "opinion" from the judge.  End result, everyone go home, the judge just wasted all parties time.  It was the same for every other  person going before the judge.  No common respect for anyone in that court house.< /text>< rate>

Wasted half a day at this court cause of a hardship paying. We agreed to a $50 reduction which was in no way worth the time and effort in the first place. Then I went to pay the total only to find out it was more than we agreed and what the minute order stated. Their excuse was it got entered incorrectly so in the end I only saved $25 which is a total joke! Don’t waste time going in they’ll still take advantage. Pay up seems to be the only message from this crooked system!</text>

I was in traffic court today, in department F-4, the judge was totally bias, she lectured anyone who had a speeding infraction, threaten to take their  license  on the spot. Knowing damn well she can't do that without do process. She went on to tell me that my speed was excessive,  and to never come to her court room again for speeding.  Note,  I wasn't  convicted  of anything due to the fact that my citing officer didn't show up.  This  judge needs a real wake up call, and hopefully she reads this. First off it's  not your court, it is the people's court, second take a look at each officer you have in that court, give them that same lecture you gave each of your accused speeders, cause every time I look around I see cop's speed going a least 85mph plus on the freeways.

Great place!! It may take a little patience to get through the lines however, the way you treat them is the way you will get treated back.</review>

< review>
If I could give them no stars, I would. I got pulled over by an officer and he said that he had to take my official hard copy license because it was suspended due to a failure to appear, and I had already taken care of that 2 months prior, so I what he had told me to do, was to come here and take care of it, and the courts said it was an error due to their new systems or whatever  it was and then they lifted the failure to appear. That's fine, but now, where's my hard copy of my license? They then contacted DMV in Sacramento and they said they couldn't lift the fee. Fontana Superior Court should've paid for my reissuing. So now I have to pay for a $35 reissue fee when it wasn't even my fault to begin with. Fed up with society's bull****< /review>

<Review>Got a ticket for recording cops. Can't make mornings so did the declaration by mail. They never recieved it and $100 ticket turned in to over $600 ticket and climbing!!! City just wants your money. No nite court either so hard working people and students gotta miss work and school. And than if you want to fight your ticket you gotta pay it (BS) and than you gotta come back and miss school or work again!!! Do something about mayor aquaneta!!!< /Review><date>1498567279331< /date>< pictures>

If you’re looking for a quality tattoo, an artist that is willing to work with your schedule, and a shop that is clean and professional, here it is. Soulution Ink Tattoos is the shop for you. I was fortunate enough to work with Stefan for a whole year and got my full sleeve, tribal tattoo done. I couldn’t be any happier with my tattoo and I’m glad that I chose this shop! Stefan was communicating with me throughout the process; he scheduled our appointments based on my work schedule and gave me a heads up if anything changes. The price/pricing for their work is reasonable and in my own opinion, I think I should’ve paid him more for his amazing work (thats how much I admire his work). Both Jaye and Stefan showed great professionalism and I respect their work. I honestly believe that it’s best tattoo shop in town, hands down. The overall vibe and the moral of the shop is very welcoming. The outstanding review/ratings for this shop speaks the truth. I highly recommend this tattoo shop to anyone. I will definitely come back for more!< /text>

<Text>Really messed up customer service. They'll ignore you after they mess up your tattoo and will refuse to fix it. The reason they have high rating is cuz they have sign at the register asking you to give high rating in exchange for embarrassing $10. People selling their integrity for $10.<//Text><user>112078682523388366008< /user><Name>Heather Crosswhite< /Name><pictures>None</pictures>< Gmap_id>

This place is the definition of diamond in the rough.  Some of the most talented tattoo artists in Northern California and for the price you cannot beat the talent.  The atmosphere is amazing you feel like you are at home and the time flies by.< /Review>

My artist was great! He was talkative, and he even gave me a hug after he finished my tattoo.  My tattoo looks amazing; I couldn't be happier.  I would most definitely recommend getting tattooed here!</review>

My experience here has been nothing but excellent, I've gotten three tattoos from Mauricio and he is the best when it comes to details and the tradition tattoos. He killed it on my sleeve and my most recent tattoo on my hand. They are very friendly and make the experience of getting a tattoo fun and comfortable, they don't see you just as a canvas too make money, they see you as a friend and talk to you and social with you the entire time.  Best tattoo shop in Elk Grove and Sacramento, will be coming back for my neck to be done!<//review>

<Review>I had a great experience with this shop. I went to Jay who did some great work on my arm. Not only is he talented in tattooing but he is a very cool guy and very professional. Everybody at the shop was very welcoming and nice. I've seen some of the other artists work and they all have insane talent as well. 5/5 definitely would recommend this place to anybody looking to get some ink done. I will be going back for more!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I've gone to Soulution Ink for 2 of the most amazing tattoos! Jaye was the artist that brought my dreams & ideas to fruition brilliantly! I couldn't wait to share my new ink with my family & friends! I've had strangers compliment me on them & I've  told them all about Solutions Ink!  I've also complimented people on their ink & been told that they too went to Soulution Ink!!!< /Review>

Jaye is an excellent artist and has great ideas!  When he showed me the finished sketch of my side piece I immediately fell in love with it!! He listens and has a very creative mind. Very clean location and friendly to all.

Everyone loves the artwork he has created for me and I have no regrets!  Already recommending others to check him out!< /Text>

< Review>
I'm from the Vacaville location and drove up to Elk Grove to get work done by Mauricio.  There are plenty of spots to get ink done in Vacaville, Sac, and other surrounding areas but there was something about Soulution Ink that drew my attention.  Maybe it's because when I first walked in to check out the artist's portfolios that the vibe I felt just right.  Or was it the music that they played aligns with my own taste?

The family atmosphere is one of many reasons why I chose Soulution Ink.  Thanks Mauricio for your amazing work and thank you Jaye for setting the tone of the atmosphere of your shop.<//Review>

I got tattooed by Mauricio recently and he's a cool dude. He gave me a twix bar haha. But joking aside, he's a really talented artist and I'm so glad to have came across his artwork. His shading and line work is amazing. I waited for a few years to find a tattoo artist that I liked, and I'm so glad I waited. I definitely want to get another tattoo by him in the future.</text>< pictures>

Besides the guys at the shop always making me feel like family. My tattoo cover up was done by Jaye. Every piece he added to my half sleeve was very detailed and looks life like. Jaye is at the top of his game.</review>

<rate>4<//rate><review>I just tried the Persian cucumber ice cream and it was delicious! It was very refreshing on a hot day and $4 for a cup is very reasonable. I can't wait to go back and try the other interesting flavors. And also, there is free parking in the lot for 30 minutes.< /review>< pics>

A tad expensive but must try icecream!  I tired the sample of their best selling flavor and immediately ordered a scoop. One small scoop is $5 but yummy.  They also give a small cup of coffee with the purchase of icecream. The brand is Moreno Coffee. Good, strong coffee! Service was good! The biggest attraction is their icecream in a cone shaped trash cone. You would notice it first on the side walk. Great store!</review>

I always have room for ice cream and decided to walk here with a friend.  Google maps told us to access the store through the alley. This is wrong!! Don't follow Google maps and stay on the main street.

After a laugh with the employee we scared by opening the rear door that the owner left unlocked, we ordered our Gelato and it was nothing less than amazing!! If you're in area, try some gelato!!</Review>

Everyone who comes in gets lifted...Oh, almost forgot the host with the most today was Hugo, who we could tell was great at figuring out what everyone wanted. A new batch of cannolis is being made now, and you can be sure I will be coming back!<//Text>< pictures>

We were so disappointed! We went there to try their gelato smoothie, but it was literally like drinking dirty water! I kid you not! I sincerely hope it was a new employee who did not know what they were doing, but I did not get the impression the employee was new! We were so disappointed we threw it away once we got outside. We did taste some of their gelato before we decided on a smoothie and the samples we received were good. My recommendation is to stick to their regular gelato!<//Text>

Gelato that's marketed as healthier than the competition, tasted great, but not all their desserts are made in-house, so was hesitant to try the cakes and pastries.</review>

<review>Friendly, upbeat franchise gelateria with a neighborhood feel, rather than the clinical over-design of many of its Beverly Hills competitors. Friendly service courtesy of a Sicilian from Scunthorpe, via Miami. The world is truly our village.<//review>< Date>

I needed an oil change for my Audi, and just like every other mechanic shop, I was expecting to wait a few hours before everything is done and finished. However, as I went in and talked to the workers, I could tell that they were not going to take super long, as they were so knowledgeable and experienced. They literally finished the oil change for my car so quick! I am not sure what to say; whether I am surprised or if I already knew this was going to happen, because just from talking to those workers, I had a feeling that this was not going to take a lot of time because they knew so much; they were so knowledgeable. They do their jobs so fast, so accurate, and so precise. On top of all, their customer service is out of this world; they are so nice and friendly, and they are always smiling. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to go to this mechanic shop; words can't describe how amazing they are. They truly take care of their customers, and their customers' cars. I know for a fact that if I have any problem with my car anytime now in the future, regardless of what the problem is, they are my go-to place.< /text>

This family owned business is so generous and truly customer service oriented. Mark and Sarmad are gentleman mechanics!

We were thrilled with our experience at Supreme Auto! Impeccable quality, finished ahead of schedule, friendly service, and overall the best in the area by far. Sam was very welcoming, explained to us exactly what needed to be done for our vehicle, and gave us an amazing deal. Highly recommend, we will be back!< /Text>

San was the best mechanic I’ve gone to in a long time. He was super helpful and professional and diagnosed what was wrong with my car and didn’t try to scam me on how much it would be to fix. The job was completed before the time he said it would be ready by. If you have car problems I highly suggest Supreme Auto Repair. Definitely will be going back whenever I have a problem< /Text>

Over the weekend I had my brakes done, Sam was amazing. He was able to fit me in and got my car completed in less then 1.5 hours. Their prices are the best around. And quality of work can't be beat. Im so glad I found Supreme auto they are my new shop for service I need on my car. They never tried to up sale me or tell me a long list of things I had wrong. There was no pressure to do anything other then what I came in for. My car has never felt so good! Thank you!!!!< /Review>

The best shop ever!

Sam lets you know what's wrong with the auto and shows you so you can decide what to do.

No pressure at all and great prices.

Included lots of extras with no additional charge, and friendly as can be :))<//Review>

<text>Sam and the rest of the supreme auto team was absolutely AMAZING !!!! I work long hours and Sam was kind enough to squeeze my vehicle in that last hour just to service my vehicle. Not only did they do an outstanding job but I was in and out in less than 45 minutes. They have my business for life! If your looking for the BEST oil change business in San Diego than look no further than Supreme auto repair , thanks again !

BACKGROUND:  In July 2020, the driver side back tire blew out causing some major damage to the back of my car.  It did cut through wires, but I had not known what other damage it might have caused.

My car was doing well until one day, the sound of the door being ajar would not stop ringing, there was an awful smell coming from the car, and the car was making a weird sound.  That is when I sent out one of those Yelp thingies to the various places about car repair.

- - - - - - - - - - -

Albeit I got a number of responses to my Yelp thingie, I started reading through each of their reviews.  Supreme Auto had amazing reviews and I think I liked that fact it was not a big commercialized place.  In one of the reviews, someone mentioned that it was a family shop and I wanted to support local shops as much as possible.

- - - - - - - - -

When I got to Supreme Auto Repair, I met Sam.  He was very nice and understanding.  I told him the whole story.  He listened.  It took one day but a complete diagnosis was completed.  I came back the next day and he explained what the major needs of the car was in order to get it back on the freeway.  I looked at the pricing and was shocked because I was being quoted about 4x more at Calibre Collision for some of the work.

I will never forget what he had to say about the wiring: "It is not rocket science if you know what you are doing, so it should not cost hundreds of dollars."  Calibre had quoted me literally $1,000+ just for the wiring alone.

I did the SNAP Loan thing which was annoying because the numbers were not working.  HOWEVER, Sam was calm, cool, and collective, while I was a panicking mess.  He was like, "Don't worry, we'll get it to work."  Which we eventually did.... Talk about a professional!

He did share that a lot of the repairs were because maintenance was not performed regularly.  He explained that even though I kept up with maintenance when I got the car, my aunt and her family had not.  Thus these issues would have surfaced one way or another.  This brought such a relief to me as I thought it was due to the tire blowing incident.

When I took the car home that same day, I noticed that the smell was gone, the door ajar ringing was gone, and the car was running smoother than when I first brought it in.  However, taking Sam's recommendation, I took the side streets home.  This time, I did not have to stop every so many miles to give the car a rest.  I think they had already done some work on my car!  Whoa!!  I doubt a car dealership or Calibre would have done that!!

- - - - - - - - - - -

The following week, I took the car in for its repair.  It took the weekend, and I got the car back on Monday (if I remember correctly).  He did share that they did a final look over to see what else needed to be fixed.  There was just one more thing.  However, he guaranteed me that I could take the car on the freeway, that I would be able to visit my family in Los Angeles, and I should not worry.  In fact, he told me to take the freeway home.  That's how confident he was in the work of his employees!

Since seeing him, I have been to LA twice and on the freeway many times.  Oh!  And I now know what 3rd gear feels like.  3rd gear wasn't working on the car before!!

- - - - - - - -

Sam and his crew are very professional, nice, humble, and industrious.  I think the operative word here is humble. They get the work done.  They go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.

So the question is: would I return to Supreme Auto Repair and Alignment?  ABSOLUTELY!!  They have not only earned my business but also my loyalty!!

Thanks Sam and the Crew!!  You all are the best!!</text>

<text>I really recommend this place they are professional, honest and punctual. They work with all car brands and do everything even alignments. They have competitive pricing always try to give you the best affordable quote. Ask for Sam he's  great and always explain everything needed with details and he's honest. It's hard to find an honest place that also do great work. So check them out if you need a great reliable mechanic shop.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>I found a coupon for brake pad replacement online for Supreme Automotive and after reading so many good reviews I decided to give them a try. I’m so glad I did! I drove out from Chula Vista and couldn’t be happier with how professional, friendly, and quick they are. I was even given a thorough explanation of how my brakes and rotors looked before they were replaced and resurfaced, which I really appreciated. I highly recommend these guys and their great work!< /review>< Pics>

I’ve gone to many mechanics but no one has been able to do what Supreme Auto Repair has done for me. They are very professional, they have integrity, and respect. However, most importantly they KNOW what they are doing. Supreme Auto Repair offers solid work and very responsible prices. I will no longer need to look anywhere else. Thank you for all you’re help Sam and crew!</Review>

< Review>
5 stars is simply not enough & words cannot express my gratitude towards Sam & his mechanic assigned to repair my car who’s name is also Sam.  I own one of the few 1990’s Nissan 300ZX (Z32) still on the road today, which had a massive engine oil leak that prevented me from driving it for nearly 5 years.  I am very tedious when it comes to my Z due to the extensive $$ in upgrades I have invested in it since the 90’s.  Sam took his time, took good care of my car like I would, and got my Z back on the road again in no time.  They kept me in the loop throughout the process & even sent me pictures of the failed components.
Supreme Auto Repair simply cannot be beat & my quest for an HONEST REPAIR SHOP is over!  I will turn to Sam & his crew for all my automotive needs.  THANKS AGAIN FOR EVERYTHING SAM & FOR POSTING PICTURES OF MY Z ON YOUR SITE!  Sorry for the late review due to this pandemic.  Stay Healthy & COVID free!</Review>

The service was really helpful. I brought in a 1986 Mercedes Benz yesterday and they knew what they were doing. It was so hard to find a repair shop that can fix my old car and find parts for it. They got me the best parts for the best price. I payed less than I even expected.<//review>

They didn’t try to up sell me on anything and wanted to make sure my car was safe before traveling back home up north. Supreme understood I was on a time crunch before leaving and was able to squeeze me in to get my brakes safe. I am extremely thankful I found this shop. I know where I’m coming if I’m ever in San Diego again! Honest shops are extremely difficult to find these days, I hope you guys are lucky enough to stumble upon this one!< /text>< Pictures>

Called 2-3 places before supreme and all were booked and wouldn’t even give me a time frame of when they could do it. Supreme was also booked, but I let them know I only had like an hour and a half between appointments and they surprisingly found a way to get me in right away!

Not only did they do a great job on the oil change but they discovered my brake pads were worn and gave me a great deal to do everything at the same time. Would recommend them 100% and especially pleased with how they are willing to work with peoples schedules< /text>< pictures>

Staff very friendly and knowledgeable. I brought my Porsche, and they were so quick to fix it! The workers there aren't like any other people who work at different mechanic shops, they're so knowledgeable, reliable, and have great customer service skills. I would highly recommend for anyone who has any problem with their car to come to this shop!</Text>

I had to have extensive brake work done on my Infiniti and Sam and team did a fantastic job!  Very reasonable price and the work was done in just a few hours ahead of the proposed pickup time.  I will be using their services going forward!</review>

<text>These guys are on point. I had been searching for a new honest mechanic since my friends shop closed. My friend recommended this shop and I haven't looked back. Fast, quality and informative. They really take pride in their work. They have a very warm and professional treat you like family environment. Their prices beat anyone around. Call these guys first before you go anywhere else.

I highly recommend taking your car here for whatever service you need.  The service was amazing and the guys, especially Sam, were so helpful.  They were able to get to my car seen sooner than expected and the price for fixing it was incredible.  I will definitely be going back to them for routine maintenance and care.</review>

<text>I found this amazing place on Groupon and decided to give them a try, they replaced the brakes on my husbands car(2016 Lexus IS200T) and my car (2019 Chevrolet Traverse).  My Chevy Traverse was just at Courtesy Chevy 3 days before getting fixed for a transmission leak, I thought my car was driving funny but thought it was just cause I needed brakes but I was wrong! When supreme auto was doing my brakes they found that Courtesy Chevy forgot to bolt something back down and my tire was shaking. They bolted it back down for free and even sent me a video of it for me to show the dealership! These people are beyond amazing, if it wasn't for them I most likely would of crashed my car! I highly recommend them to anyone for anything! I 100% trust them more then the dealership! Thank you guys so much!<//text>< GmapID>

This place is one of the best in El Cajon! They aren’t your typical mechanic shop and they definitely don’t rip you off! The pricing is great. I took my car in for an oil change and they were so fast at getting the job done. The staff is very friendly and honest. I will definitely be coming back to this place and highly recommend it to anyone who is local.< /Text>

<review>Brought my vehicle to these guys so they could run an inspection on it for me to start driving Uber. I just want to say that they are honest, humble, and skilled mechanics who have many years of experience and do a fantastic job.

They checked everything in my car and made sure it was clear for the inspection. I got my rear brake pads and all 4 rotors replaced for a really affordable rate. The car drives like new now! Highly recommend taking your car here for any service. They can do it all.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I took my Range Rover into supreme auto repair for an oil change, I was paying such high prices at the Range Rover service center. I’m so glad I went into supreme they are super honest! Also got my breaks done with them. I would definitely refer them to all my family and friends for any auto service!</Review>< Pics>

These guys are amazing. Totally honest and they fixed my panel under my front end without even telling me. I only noticed after getting home, cause it wasn't hanging on the passenger side anymore. I really do trust and appreciate these guys .<//review>

I’ve been going here for all my auto needs. For my car and my wife’s car. These guys are very knowledgeable, very efficient, very professional, and just overall take pride in providing great customer service to everyone. I recommend Supreme Auto Repair to anyone in need of mechanics who don’t take advantage of you and give you the quality service on your vehicle that is needed.< /Text>

When i went on my Vacation to San Diego, I had a rental that brokedown on me. I went Supreme Auto Repair and talked with the owner Sam he was a very knowledgeable, trust worthy guy. The repairs for my vehicle was going to take several days, and he gave me his personal vehicle for my family and i to enjoy our vacation. i had the best experience at Superme Auto Repair, i would absolutely refer my friend, family and everyone in San Diego to visit.<//Text>

I needed an oil change and saw their coupon on groupon, but I didn't buy it. I just walked in without an appointment and it was very fast service. All I had to do was tell them I needed an oil change and they did it faster than I have experienced in other shops.</Review>

My car broke down on the way to Arizona . I took it to the dealership and they stated it would take about a week or so to diagnose ( 56 cars ahead of me ) The Uber driver referred me to this place. Right away they told me what was wrong with my vehicle and fixed it with in hours . Sarmad was super friendly and nice he made me feel safe and comfortable and confident that they would fix my car and I could safely get back home . I’m forever thankful for an amazing customer service for the Amazing repairs and for Getting my vehicle up and running. Thank you guys 🧡< /Review>

<text>WARNING this place is the real deal! I stumbled across this place online advertising a deal for a synthetic oil change. They definitely are priced very competitive which attracted me, so I gave them a shot. Sam took care of me as he provided a price match of there online special which eliminated any possible confusion that online purchasing might give. Since my car is a 2006 VW Jetta it's costs for anything mechanical typically are a lot more than the American or Asian automobiles. With that being said, Sam was able to accommodate the extra 1.5qts of oil and special filter it took to complete the job with charging me a slight increase in the advertised price which I expected for a car like mine. I recommend this for anyone in need for auto service. Clean, professional, friendly, honest, and fair priced. Try them out!</text>< Time>

I got a flat tire this morning on my way to work and called to check availability on the replacement tire, Leonel was very polite and helpful, Mike was very friendly wish I would have gotten the technicians name as well (very fast and helpful individual took his time to show me the damage and inspect the rest of my tires)., Ford Roadside Assistance sent me a tow truck at no charge and I was out of there in no time !!! Thanks again God Bless!!!</Review>

I had an appointment for 8:00am and they brought my truck in fairly shortly after that. Oil change and tire rotation were both handled very quickly. Thomas was very friendly and extremely helpful. Highly recommend this shop!</Review>

< review>
Service was quick.
Typical though, a long list of fixes recommended. Most all of them taken care of 3 months earlier at a different Ford dealer. Obviously a check list they use and not an observation of condition.</review>

<Text>The customer service I receive from Thomas is always 5 star! However the management really needs to streamline there service scheduling efficiency. Oil changes should be managed different from all other services. Quick lane should be quick not 1hour or 2 for and oil change only! Once again the shop does excellent work but they do not manage the order of there services well, A person can walk in and request and oil change and never know that there eaite time is based on the next available service tech who could be doing a full brake replacement (2 & 1/2 hour job)when all you need is just and oil change (45min job).< /Text><resp>{'time': 1543250269433, 'text': 'We very much appreciate the feedback Global One!

Very bad! I've been here since 2:30pm and it's almost 5 just to chance one tire! Just one tire! Had to leave work early because I got a flat and they told me to come in so I did. Than previously  when i took my car to get serviced, they rotated my tire when they knew it had a screw in it and they put that one tire in the front knowing the most movement is in the front! Can't believe almost three hours just to replace A tire! I'll be letting the main manager know about this! Unacceptable!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I've written several reviews on this business. My last one was not so good. But I must say that Mike the manager at quick Lanes called me the next morning and he made it right. He always takes pride in his business and does what he can for the customers. So if you should have any problems I would look up Mike the manager in quick Lanes before going to anybody else. He'll listen to you instead of the other service techs over in the regular service department. Thanks again Mike for my new tires<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I know a lot about cars and have my own equipment at home. When my cars check engine light when on, I immediately plugged it u to my device used to detect what specific problem the car is having. A service they charge $130 for I might add. I went in knowing what the issue was and told them about it. They ran the test I had already done myself and charged me $130 but cleared the issue so the light would disappear. Thinking they fixed my issue I ran my car as usual and the check engine light once again popped up. I took it back and they said it was a combination of issues one of which I told them about the first time I went in. I had the car serviced totaling at $400. It's two days later and the light is back on for the same issue they supposedly fixed!! This place is trash. Don't come here.< /review>< pics>

<text>I scheduled my appointment for 8am on a Saturday for 4 new tires and alignment. I had previously asked how long it would take, and I was told 2 - 2.5 hrs. By 1pm I hadn't heard anything so I called, and they informed me that one of their machines was down and had to be fixed and that it would be ready by 3:30. I received the call at 4pm. Since I live right around the corner, I was there in 2 mins. I didn't leave until after 5pm because the guy checking me out had computer issues and needed to fill out paperwork that hadn't been done. The last time I had gotten new tires, we put new rims on. We kept the stock rims and I wanted them to put those back on my SUV. when I got into my car, all 4 old tires with the rims still attached were in the back of my car. I went back in to inform them that I didn't need the tires and that they still billed me the tire disposal fee. So I had to wait another 20 minutes for them to pop the rims off the old tires and put just the rims back in my car. When I got home, I realized how low the tires looked. I had my husband look at them and he tested the air pressure. 50 psi is what it needed and 3 tires were at 25 and one was at 15 psi. In addition to that, they didn't return the lug nuts from the rims they took off. My husband had to go back to retrieve the lug nuts and to get the tire pressure fixed. Seriously!?!?! After spending over $1k, you would expect much better service. It took the whole day and they did a horrible job. We will not be going back to this place, and I would recommend you find another place for your vehicles.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>WHAT EVER TIME LIMIT THEY GIVE YOU TRIPLE IT. LITERALLY

I would never trust these people to do actual mechanic work but popping tires on rims is pretty simple with a decent machine. Even brought my wheels in off the car cause ya never know with these places.
I wish i woulda trusted the other reviews more. with so many options around to choose from there is no reason to ever go here. for your own peace of mind stay away. They will also try to nickel and dime you which is petty and irritating. ex $25/$20/$15 were prices i was given for mounting and balancing. So i guess they just make up prices as they feel fit.< /Text><time>1481676992703< /time>< Rate>

< Review>
The service was extremely slow. It took over two hours for just an oil change. When I got home and checked under the hood not all of the tabs had been replaced on the engine cover. Very sloppy job, there was oil on top of the engine around oil fill causing a burning smell. Very disappointed. The one star is for a decent waiting room.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Horrible service! Never going back! Suuuper slow and no sense of urgency. It doesn't take 1-1 1/2 hrs for an oil change with a tire rotation. Horrible wait time on way too many occasions. Not going back. Even with an appointment, it's a MINIMUM 1 1/2 hrs. HORRIBLE!
I once made an appointment mid last year for an oil change service and it took over 4 hrs! I left my car there and went to have breakfast with my girlfriend to kill time, thinking that it'd be done by then. NOPE! We then went to Target and, NOPE! 4+ hrs on an appointment for an oil change! Horrible! Always horrible wait time and poor customer service. Technicians have ZERO SENSE OF URGENCY and no pride in their work, which is a direct reflection of the FORD QUICKLANE! If I was FORD, a major company/corporation, I'd probably be very upset and a red flag, well actually, Multiple red flags, would be going up! Never going back!
I ended up going to Spoiled in Moreno Valley, on Alessandro, right off the freeway, n I was in and out in about 15 minutes. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! GREAT SERVICE!
1 million % better than Ford Quicklane. I recommend Spoiled! I'm glad my friend referred me to them. He was absolutely right!

<text>I was lied to about my battery needing to​ be replaced. I got a second test done elsewhere and they told me it passed and there is nothing wrong with the battery or my alternator. Maybe they are just trying to make sales. Never going back.< /text>< pics>

If there was a minus star, I'd give it a minus -5.  This place is very poor  in service and quality.  I was told it would be a turnaround time of appx 60 mins, there were only two cars ahead of me, so I chose to wait.  I sat there for 97 mins.  I constantly watched the cameras as they worked, or if there was little movement on the car.  I spoke to Austin regarding the status after 70 mins, he said they were working still on it and needed to rotate the tires.  After 30 more mins, he returned with my paperwork and said it was ready.  I questioned  him regarding the rotation of my tires because I did not see ANYONE rotate the tires, he said that they were fast and that they did rotate them.  What a bunch of lies - major integrity issue.

Also, don't plan on expecting your appointments to run smoothly either, it really doesn't matter if you have an appointment or not, they put you in the order when you come in.  Again, they claim they will do one thing, but don't.  I won't use them again, and trust me, I will make sure everyone who has any interest in using them know the truth about this facility and company.  Consumer beware.....</Text>

The wait time is ridiculous. I took my truck to get an oil change they told me the wait was about 1 hour and I was there waiting for almost 3 hours and it could of been longer if I didn't get up to ask. I will never go back to this place again.<//review>

Service was good but I thought the price was expensive.  I ended up getting my car fixed at the dealership, because it was 100 dollars cheaper.</Review>

Excellent service! My external drive stopped working during my school semester and I was very stressed about the possibility of losing my files. I definitely didn't want to attempt the repair myself. I'm so glad I found Five Star Data Recovery. They were very prompt, friendly and helpful. Communication was easy and my new drive with all of my recovered files was ready within a few days. Well worth the money spent. Thank you!<//text>

They are attentive, friendly, and absolutely adept at what they do. I was in a total tailspin of panic when the logic board fried on my Mac Book Pro, and the saints over at 5Star reassured me, and then delivered 100 percent of the data from my hard drive. They are very reasonable with prices, and are quick and efficient with their work. I’m truly grateful for having discovered them...< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><response>{'time': 1615430938795, 'text': 'Hello J,\n\nI apologize for your bad experience. I assume you spoke to Elen over the phone and she provided you a quote for Data Recovery on a case that requires mechanical repairs in a Clean Room, due to physical damage to the drive. Our flat rate fee for Clean Room cases that require donor parts in order to recover the data is $950.00. Most of the time, we discount this price as much as possible to help our customers, but we prefer to quote high and discount, rather then quote low and raise the price.\n\nPLEASE BEWARE OF GOING TO COMPUTER REPAIR SHOPS FOR DATA RECOVERY: We see these sorts of cases everyday. Customers go the affordable route to recover the data, then come back to us weeks later after the drive is tortured and nothing is left to recover. It\'s impossible that a computer repair shop will be able to repair a "Mechanical Issue" with the drive. They would need a Clean Room, Head Tools, Specialized Software and Engineering knowledge to be able to repair the issue in order to recover the data. IF they had all of this, they couldn\'t afford to offer the service for anything less than what we have quoted. 99% of the time if you go to a "Computer Repair Shop" to "Recover Data" from a physically damaged drive, your data will be LOST FOREVER.\n\nWe are the ONLY data recovery company in town that offers:\n\n- Same Day Free Diagnosis\n- $0.00 Paid Upfront for Clean Room Data Recovery Cases (not even cost of the donor parts)\n- 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed or you pay nothing (no fine prints or hidden charges)\n- Family style service at the best prices available\n\n99% of the time, our prices and terms cannot be beat. Occasionally competitors may try to beat our prices (not terms) by a small percentage, but thats very rare.\n\nAGAIN, BEWARE OF GOING TO COMPUTER REPAIR SHOPS IF YOU DATA IS IMPORTANT. YOU ONLY HAVE ONCE CHANCE AT RECOVERING THE DATA. ONCE THEY DESTROY THE DRIVE, THERE IS NO GOING BACK.\n\nGood Luck with your recovery, you can contact me, Vahan, directly by email, phone, text or live chat 24/7/365.\n\nThank you,\n\nVahan H\nFive Star Data Recovery\nOwner/Head Engineer'}< /response><Text>Quoted me 900 dollars to fix my WD Elements hard drive

{'time': 1621284801153, 'text': "Hello Pink,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your review. I'm so sorry you didn't have a good experience.\n\nI just asked Elen about the call and the quote that she provided to you (our Flat Rate $950.00 fee for Clean Room cases for drives with Mechanical problems after physical damage).\n\nYou stated that your drive was dropped and after the drop, the drive was making whirring like sounds. She asked you if the sounds were normal and you said it definitely wasn't. And she informed you that IF the issue with your drive is mechanical, our flat rate fee would be $950.00 to recover the data.\n\nAlthough I believe the customer is ALWAYS right, in this case, I don't see what Elen could have done differently.\n\nI am very AGAINST quoting customers our lower $300.00 fee just to get them through the door, then attempt bait and switch tactics. We are always 100% transparent about our fees. IF your case would have ended up NOT being mechanical, your fee would have been only $300.00. Elen is NOT an Engineer. She is a receptions. She only answers calls and takes in cases. The Engineers would thoroughly diagnose your drive and let you know what type of recovery you need. Only after that, will you be provided an EXACT price and decide if you want to move forward with the recovery or not.\n\nWe are the ONLY DATA RECOVERY company that truly does NOT charge a penny until the data is recovered. All of these BUDGET companies claim to be more affordable, but if you add up all of their hidden fees and UPFRONT (non-refundable donor part costs), you will realize that we would have been the better option :).\n\nAgain, I apologize that your experience was anything but FIVE STARS. If you would like to schedule a couple minutes for a quick phone call, I would be happy to help any way possible, even if you'd still like to move forward with the other Data Recovery company.\n\nWishing you all the best and hope you get your data recovered safely!\n\nVahan H\nFive Star Data Recovery\nOwner/Head Engineer"}<//Resp>

<text>Truly 5 star data recovery.

Their customer service is great and they put a lot of effort out to recover the data from a hard drive I brought to them. In the end the requirements for the data recovery I needed were beyond their scope of work, but they did what they could and even ordered parts to try and recover the data.

I ended up not being charged anything at all for the work they did in attempt to recover the data. I will be back if I need data recovery from a different drive.</text>< user_name>

I really wanted to leave a review here because I just had a very very positive experience with this business. The employee who was working on my damaged drive was extremely professional and very very hard working. I had updates on the progress quite often (almost every day) and he was replying to my emails, even when it was late in the evening. I was lucky that my drive was not too damaged and he was able to successfully recover about 98% of the data of the drive, which is absolutely amazing. The content of that drive was very very precious to me, and I'm so glad that almost nothing was lost. Of course that can change for other people depending on what the problem is, but I wanted to share my great experience with others. You should definitely go there if you have the need for it.
They are also providing contact-free support and they are careful in their interactions.<//text>

We had a corrupt drive at our office and Five Star Data Recovery was able to retrieve for us at a reasonable cost. Our information felt safe with them and our physical drive was returned after retrieving. We would definitely use this company again and will recommend them to any one in need of their services.<//Review>

<Review>Someone  (I have no idea who) sabotaged  a project of mine that represented about 2 months work, permanently deleted an entire folder. Because I didn't notice the folder was missing till after 30 days had passed, my backup service no longer had a copy of it. Five Star Data Recovery managed to recover it off my hard drive for a very reasonable price. I can't tell you how excited I was to see my data again. This place is great!</Review>< rate>

Don’t trust your important data anywhere else. These guys are the best. It’s all in the name: 5 star performance and service all the way. You’ll know from your first call. They came in on a Sunday especially for me specifically to ensure a greater chance of recovery of my data and, sure enough, their tenacity paid off. 100% real review. This place is where it’s at. Honestly: don’t go anywhere else. Don’t even think about it.  Thank you guys! You are really the best.<//Text>

<date>1590537352854< /date><Text>As a videographer and recording artist from NYC, I MUST leave this review:
At the risk of sounding corny, Five Star Data Recovery has every right to call themselves FIVE STAR. Everything about my experience with this team was deserving of every. single. star. From my initial call for a quote to the actual process of recovering my external hard drive, Vahan (head engineer) was so absolutely professional, personable, and thorough. He walked me through the entire process and answered any question that arose. Emailing me several times throughout the process to give me efficient and thoroughly explained updates (even on his birthday!) His assistant Elen was incredibly helpful, supportive, and sweet. They had even paid extra to express ship the hard drive, because the first label was printed incorrectly, ensuring I would have my hard drive in a timely manner.

I received the drive today and they safely and successfully restored 99.9999% of my drive. And the small percentage that was damaged were useless backend files anyway. I am relieved and elated. Thank you to the entire team at FIVE STAR! I highly recommend them!!!<//Text>< resp>

This is the first time I’ve ever written a google review because the service was so good I would feel guilty not sharing my experience. They were sweet, helped me understand the problem and manage my expectations, and worked overnight updating me in great detail about everything! Even went out of his way to reseal my iMac with the same glue that Apple uses so that my warranty wouldn’t expire. Would give 10 stars if I could!!< /Review>

The person that helped me was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He was quickly able to identify the problem and offered a workable solution since I was in a hurry. I was impressed with is overall demeanor, which was calm and confident. He repaired it on the spot, which was nice. The shop itself is very neat and clean, and the woman on the phone that I talked to before coming in was kind and helpful as well. I was able to get back to my doctoral work and submit something that was time sensitive. I highly recommend this company for any type of Mac repairs.</review>

Five Star Data Recovery is AMAZING. They are kind, patient, and compassionate, and Vahan and his wife may be the nicest human beings I have ever met. I brought them a very difficult task and they saved over 97% of my files. I can't recommend Five Star enough. It should be called Ten Star! Thank you so much!!<//review>

As I sit here, about to get my data back that I thought I might never see again, I can only thank the heavens I came here instead of the many options I had for data recovery.  These are good people that know what they are doing.  They answered all of my serious and silly questions, as well as, treated me with respect and professionalism. I would definitely recommend these guys to anyone who want to make the experience as painless as possible (on your mind and your wallet).<//Review>

Drive far if you have to!  And this is why... Vahan is the real deal and actually cares and loves what he does.  You'll see what I mean when you meet him.  I don't know how you feel about your data but I need someone that will respect my property and privacy, who's honest and will take care of my data like it's his own.  With all the fraudulent activity and identify theft going on, I think this part really matters and I wouldn't leave my data with just anyone!  You can tell he's not trying to "game" you with unnecessary fees and BS.  I've been to 2 other data recovery spots and most didn't seem to have the level of sincerity and concern Vahan had for my needs.  I remember going to one spot and just walked out after getting shallow answers and inflated prices...  almost as if they didn't want my business.  This spot was in Silverlake but I won't mention any names.  Just keep reading the other reviews for Five Star Data Recovery in Glendale and you'll feel confident trusting Vahan with your data.  Thanks again Vahan!!  I'll be referring everyone to you who needs your service... even if they live in Alaska!<//Review>< pics>

{'time': 1534317674646, 'text': 'Lisa,\n\nWe thank you for taking time out of your day to leave us a review. It\'s upsetting though that instead of being grateful for the service we offered and the exceptions we made for you; you end up writing us a bad review.\n\n(I APOLOGIZE in advance about my lengthy review, its just frustrating an upsetting when a customer tries to degrade our reputation with lies. In this response, I will go section by section and clarify the facts. Also, I\'ve attached a screenshot of the back and forth conversation and work done on this ticket).\n\nThis review is pertaining to ticket #5122. The drive was dropped and the customer was not able to access any of the data on the drive. The drive had platter damage at the start of the drive. This was not a typical recovery case. This case required extreme care, caution and monitoring.\n\n-\n\nCUSTOMER: "Taking a hard drive to this place was an expensive, time-consuming, and bad decision on my part."\n\nWe are by far the most affordable Professional Data Recovery Company (there are a few others in town with similar pricing, but not more affordable than us). We have a full clean room on site and state of the art equipment. The price quoted for your recovery was $300.00. We waived the $100.00 expedite fee while I stayed at work till 2:00am to make sure I could get you the important files you needed for your project recovered on time.\n\nI completely understand that $300.00 is still a lot of money, but if you shop around, you\'ll realize how affordable we are compared to companies charging between $800-$2,000 for cases such as yours.\n\nAs far as time consuming goes... You brought your drive in on Mon 05-21-18 10:38 AM and we had the 3 important files you needed for a project that weekend along with 671GB of other data on Wed 05-23-18 12:03 AM. I assure you that even if you purchased the expedited service at any other Data Recovery company, the turnaround time would not have been this fast.\n\n-------\n\nCUSTOMER: "He started some diagnostics and said things looked good. He felt confident he could secure most of the files"\n\nWe did for you what no Data Recovery Company does. We connected your drive to our disk imager (in your presence so you can see the process and feel a little more at ease), and the beginning part of your drive was damaged. I made this clear in the first 15 minutes you were in our lab. This was also noted on the work order you signed (please see attached screenshot of the work order).\n\n-------\n\nCUSTOMER: "so I felt confident leaving the drive and paying for the service."\n\nWe never charge anything upfront for our Data Recovery Services. We completed your recovery on Wed 05-23-18 12:03 AM. You came in on the 24th of May to review your recovery. Once approved, we were going to transfer the data to your new drive. You were never at any point obligated to pay anything. All you had to do was say I don\'t want the results and you didn\'t have to pay. My goal was for you to be happy. I gave you the 3 important files you needed for your project and charged you $0.00. You then asked us to transfer the rest of data to the new drive you provided. We did that and you didn\'t show up until today, August 14th to pay for our services.\n\n-\nCUSTOMER: "I didn\'t hear from him when he said he\'d call so I followed up. Then the story started to change and suddenly he couldn\'t recover much from the drive".\n\nWe were in constant contact with the customer about the recovery. We sent the customer 5 Status updates in less than 36 hours. Every step of the way, we informed the customer of what was going on, and how the recovery was going.\n\n(Due to character limits in Google Reviews, we have provided a link to our Yelp Profile where you can read the entire review response)\n\nFull Response on Yelp Profile\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/five-star-data-recovery-glendale\n\nFull Transcript of Case\n\nhttp://www.fivestardatarecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Recovery-Ticket-5122-Transcript-.png\n\nThank you,\n\nVahan H\nFive Star Data Recovery'}<//response>

<Text>My Grandfather William Thomas Perry Jr. was an aeroplane mechanic who worked in North American in World War 2. Received his certificate in Oklahoma right before he moved to California with wife in 1942. He was in the Merchant Marines for approximately for three weeks then his supervisor found out that he had an certificate in aeroplane mechanic training school. They told him that he was needed at North American in 1942 because he had skills and experience as a mechanic and completed his vocational training in that field and because of his training my Grandfather was abled to transfer to enter into North American.

You aren’t allowed to go in and there aren’t any public tours but you can see the falcon 9 fairly close up and it’s pretty cool.< /Review>

<review>Stopped here after landing into LAX to see where the innovation happens! No tourists around, just security guards who don’t acknowledge you. When I ask a question to the security guard, she ignored me. The Hyperloop tunnel is across the street.< /review>< user_name>

AMAZING WHAT THIS COMPANY IS DOING AND HAS ACCOMPLISHED!! And to be able to see in person their first successful rocket🚀 that landed back on earth, making breakthroughs with rocket reusability and space flight is inspiring. This company is making history! 👍Definitely worth stopping by and schedule a tour when you get the chance 🚀😊<//review>

Love or hate how they operate, you have to admit they've brought a tremendous amount of innovation to the aerospace field. And placing B1019 at a corner of the lot for the public to admire was a brilliant PR move for a legitimate piece of history as the world's first orbital-class rocket booster than was successfully recovered via return to launch site and vertical landing.<//text>

<review>SpaceX is the coolest place I've ever been, the scale of their missions is out of this world. If you ever have the chance to take a tour or work here, don't miss your opportunity to be part of greatness. If you have a Tesla stop by the Design Studio next to charge. Safe travels Starman!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM20DPHNH1svetCSINLT3xhqx26X2zvEQhVJrv3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Okay I was lucky enough to take a tour inside this place is awesome.  It was so cool learning how they design the rockets and the 3d printers are amazing.  Excellent place to work at they have a good size cafeteria and seem to really respect their staff. Elon musk has done such an amazing job, I really have to hand it to him. The security guards drive around in Tesla's.  I cant wait to see more of what this genius has to offer the world. No photography allowed inside.<//review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This is where the magic happens, or at least rocket science. The seat of power for the real life Tony Stark, as Elon Musk plots the way to Martian domination. Hopefully in our lifetimes. The first Falcon 9 first stage that landed after lofting payload to orbit is displayed out front. Fence replaced by glass on the corner for better view, and Falcon 9 lit like a beacon from future at night. If you are nearby it is worth a drive by and perhaps a picture.

[Edit] Added few nighttime pics of the booster. Sorry for the low quality, but best a cell phone could do after dark.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWsO_fe2RvvsT8-MPsgnoarHJ75Vz-L8E9fQLM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ19S1tFFvcehhNapLUkyUTxq3-xoXSAbdptTm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b5dee46db32d:0x5589bf4232c10232</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Really cool place. You might have to know someone in order to get an actual tour, but if you can you definitely should (just hope that they're not launching on that day otherwise you won't get to go inside). The Boring Company tunnel is also nearby which is a pretty interesting place to visit. Apparently Elon visits every once in a while so you might just get lucky.</review>< Pictures>

I was lucky enough to tour the entire facility here and was completely blown away. This place is amazing, even just from the outside and just getting on the grounds and seeing the rocket out front was amazing. I won't say what's inside to any detail, but there are officially released pictures of the facility you can Google to give you an idea of what it looks like. The staff was very professional [they only hire the best as you can imagine] The cafeteria was like a double decker restaurant which works like a well-oiled machine to feed the hundreds of people who work day and night there to create some of the greatest innovations of our time. There were many different office spaces with all kinds of designers and engineers and the production floor was very diverse with tons of different sections with groups doing all kinds of various tasks; an all in one production shop that is truly state of the art.</review>

It was amazing to see how much work goes into the creation of these rockets. The facility was incredible. It’s surprisingly small for what I imagined they needed to do all that they do, but they use the existing space efficiently. I would definitely tour the facility again if given the chance.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

A company full of imagination and creativity is here to see the perfect showcase of cutting-edge technology in the United States.

I had the privilege of taking a tour of the facility and was shocked how amazing it was! I was unaware of the tunnel racing space x hosts and I was also fascinated to see each rocket! If they haven't stopped already, I highly recommend to take a tour of the facility!<//Review>

They are a fixture in Hawthorne and a world leader in space technology. Be sure to check out that Falcon first stage that is displayed at the southeast corner of the property.</Review>

If you are fortunate enough to get to visit, you will be blown away by the technology they employ and how clean and well run everything is.   It makes me proud that a privately run company can do things that whole countries have never done before.</Review>< pictures>

Sunday Oct 7 became a historic evening for my wife and I.
While seated on our patio in Indio, California enjoying the nighttime Southern skies a very bright object appeared from behind the Santa Rosa Mountains and suddenly unbeknownst to us we were witnessing our first ever live space Rocket launch! It was ducking in and out of unseen clouds so it was difficult to figure out what was taking place. The white trail behind it turned orange which I now assume occurred when the booster engine was jettisoned. The Rocket emerged from the clouds and filled the heavens with an eerie super bright light. Wow, it was spectacular! We are totally uninformed and surprised at what is going on in the Aerospace Industry anywhere but especially
here in California! I did some catching up. So Spacex sends their reusable Falcon Rocket into space to place a satellite into orbit and then it and the reusable 1st booster engine return to Vandenberg AFB to land at their original launch site! A first for them on the West Coast. Congratulations, it’s Unreal‼️When I was a kid our family huddled around a 1929 Vacuum Tube radio for our entertainment. Today what Spacex is accomplishing is out of this World!<//review>

Went there for an interview and was super impressed by the facility. In this relatively decent size facility, I was surprised to see entire rockets (all stages + engines) being made and tested. The cafeteria is excellent and the people are brilliant.< /Text>

Drove past SpaceX when in L.A. this summer. Was impressed at the immensity of the facility.  Great company, great leadership...a great future to look forward to! Having worked on the proposal stage of the Hubble at Martin Marietta, it would be cool to be on board again with such an exciting company.<//text>

<Review>I was with a group of GLOBE students, parents, and trainers from Africa and Japan last July for a tour of Space X.  The GLOBE Program is sponsored by NASA and Space X supports activities that lead to STEM careers. The tour inspired us all to look into STEM and help others do the same.

No photos were allowed but if you saw Tim Urban's tour on the Dec 21 webcast, that was what we saw.  At the end, the guide surprised us with a bag of Space X  souvenirs：t-shirt, cap, postcards.  What a company!</Review>< Name>

I know this place is always on lockdown but the really cool thing is that you can still enjoy all the out some space-related view for example you will be able to see a Falcon 9 rocket outside the hyperloop.<//text>

First of all, I have never been so excited in my entire life to drive to Space X and see the world changing in a great way.

Space X is the happening place, Elon Musk and his Companies, Space X and Tesla Motors (to name just a few) are changing the world as we know it!  The people that work here share this vision!  Electric forms of transportation, Populating Mars and other places in our Solar System, these have been dreams for along time, and so much more!  Elon Musk and those who work with him are making these dreams a reality!

Thank you for making this happen for all of us!< /Text>

<review>Made a delivery there the other day. Receivers are kinda rude. Not what the issues with them is im sure they get paid good. Waiting so long for them to get a forklift and get their pallet out and with an attitude. I did get to see some cool rocket 🚀 parts laying around. Dont think its open to the public but there is nothing to see there anyways, othen than grumpy forklift operators.< /review>< pictures>

What an amazing facility. I didn't get to tour bc of a security mixup, but just the outside is impressive. From the parking lot you can see the first rocket to ever land back on earth from space. Very awe inspiring.< /review>

<Text>Interesting how these photos are in the public area at Space X. After I took them, a guard told me not to take any more photos.  The board shows the live action around the world  the amount of Tesla Charging going on at the moment. This was fascinating! And especially since yesterday was the successful launch of the Falcon heavy works Elon's Tesla roadsters off into outer space. The map was good example of the world wide acceptance of Tesla.  I loved it and felt great knowing that the electric car is being accepted around the globe. In that moment I felt a oneness with others around the planet. Thank you Elon for that feeling. Sorry to the guard for taking the photo. I wonder if that board appears on the internet. I have seen smaller versions in other Tesla showrooms and so I felt good about publishing these photos.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< user>

<rating>1</rating><review>I am an Uber driver. Today I had a client who needed to be dropped off at SpaceX. Everything with the trip went fine until I got there and was hassled by some security guard. I pulled up by the building and let the rider out but according to the wannabe cop I wasn't suppose to do that. I was suppose to talk to security even though there were no signs telling me to. Stupid jerk took a picture of my car and told me never to come back even though it was an honest mistake<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Thank goodness for Space X. I would love to see humans on mars, and whilst NASA faff about with over complicated solutions it seems you are really looking in to an efficient means of getting to the red planet. I don't know who's idea it was to set up Space X but well done indeed.

A greatful aspirationalist in the UK.</review>

Kudos to the company and mission, but guys...your web site has the wrong address!
You are located in California, but address shows McGregor Tx, I know you have sites in both places, but details make the difference between success and failure. It just doesn't impress; and I want you to TOTALLY IMPRESS!!. Just another mid course correction

What the SpaceX team is doing is nothing short of remarkable. I would definitely like to see more updates on the site in regards to Falcon Heavy & especially Falcon X Heavy. Sowe can really consider going to Mars. It would be great if we could find as quick a progress with human life support systems. GO SPACEX your fantastic.

<userid>109935448925538799936< /userid><text>My husband michael a. cangi jr has been working at space exploration technology since may 11th 2009. I have to say that we have never experienced  being employed  at a place  as unique as spacex. It has been abit like an ongoing drama at work and  off work. The launch parties that i have been to have been great. THe food at the parties is  very good quality also and the expresso  bar.. I remember a chocolate fountain with strawberries for dipping that was very good. The  rides also were magical. . There was even a tea cups ride with a creatures face which looked abit like salvadore dalis surreal paintings. There hasn't been a launch party in a  while and i am  excitedly awaiting one again., I remember one of the first lanch parties i went to and there was a tesla miniature car track. . I hope we can celebrate again. Brenda kay cangi 10/09/12</text>< date>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) We have not finished fully exploiting the entire interior of the cupboard that we already want to put things on top.

We give man everything necessary to live and breathe unlimited for free.
But no !
The man he wants to take the lead and go and pay for his breathing in limited elsewhere.

It's still space this story.

For me, for sure, he is elsewhere..street.

C'est quand même space cette histoire.

<text>(Translated by Google) An impressive place, futuristic installations, directed by ELON MUSK the most important person of the 21st century after Stephen Hawking. Wonderful independent company that has already surpassed NASA. And that will be thanks to the ambitions of Musk who will take the human being to Mars before anyone else, which will be the most important event in the history of the human being. Thanks to MUSK the extinction of the human race will take a long time
