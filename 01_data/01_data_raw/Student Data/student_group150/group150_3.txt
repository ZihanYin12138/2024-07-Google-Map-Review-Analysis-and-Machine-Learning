Nice place! Just slightly too expensive for me but not crazy expensive. I used to pay $20 at the barber and they gave more services that I liked. But if you care for what they have here than you might appreciate this place better. The hot towels and massages are great. So you might like this more. Just the price for me. Other than that, I'll be back.</review>

< Review>
THANK YOU SHERRI!  Great service and quality. To be honest... I would never go to a chain store yet I really needed my hair to be camera-ready. As a female preferring what people deem to be a "man's cut", I often get mistreated/looked at oddly/not given what I want.  Sherri was amazing and really listened to me -- she executed a smooth gradient fade up and did not touch the top of my hair as requested, until I did ask for a tiny trim in the back.  Even the back of my  neck was done perfectly. Appointment was running on schedule, location was clean too.<//Review>

And all the times that we go the hair cut is on point. My only gripe is when they finish with the cut they don't clean the hairs that fell on their forehead, ears and neck area. They need to have some quality control for after the hair cut. I know that there is an upgrade package that offers shampoo's. But all I ask for is them to invest in some barber brushes, baby powder and clean up after the cut.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c34c01c9f13059:0x798cab086397c6b7</gmapID></record>

That was all that mattered. My husband's haircut experience was great.  We were disappointed that this location has been temporarily closed.
They had a good sanitizing system in operation as well. We'll return when they reioen.</Review>< pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>It was my first time here and no one greeted me or explained that I was to sign in. Yes there are signs but common courtesy, come on. The girls didn't even make eye contact. The sign inside read "Good haircuts are not cheap and Cheap haircuts are not good". That was the only thing I liked about this place... Well that and the fact they had a T.V.s everywhere. They didn't give my son a "good" haircut. They didn't even bother to do anything with his hair after the cut. I mean, at least comb it to the side, make it look like He got a haircut!!! My main complaint is just how the girls there were. The only nice one was a thin girl. The "bigger" ones were rude. Sorry, but that's the only way I can describe them . Sounds effed up, but it's not. Anyway, learn how to be polite and helpful girls and more people will come back!!!!<//Review>< pics>

I have been here twice. It's good. Nice people,
And clean place.  Love the sports theme and tvs. Better than Great Clips because seems like they have more experience with fades. They make sure you are satisfied and don't complain to fix whatever you feel needs fixing.  However,  for the price, I rather go to a barber that specializes in fades.< /Text>

Very friendly, clean, accommodating, willing to discuss what kind of hairstyles and length is best. Bianca started cutting and went shorter until my 17 year old son was happy. I truly enjoyed the sport themed atmosphere! I highly recommend this place!!< /Review>

I Realy like this place much better than the other chains but expect to pay a little more for a well trained stylist. You can book online or walk in and service is usually just a short wait. They cater to men so we have a place just for us and our boys.  Once you pick your stylist you can request them the next time so you always get a consistent cut.<//Text>

So frustrating. Online says they close at 4 today. Walked in at 3:25, and they say they're already closed, even though folks are still in the place. Kinda rude about it too.</review>

Truly enchanted with their variety and freshness of all their meals. Today we got Gyro Sandwichs, yummy homemade humus that we already tried and came for more, lentils soup, pita bread and some other delicious specialities. Just found out also you can order delivery which is just perfect. Btw talk about variety of pita bread!< /Text>

This is my favorite new market. Fresh and affordable. Good blend of ripe and almost ripe veggies. Butcher onsite.
Amazing cheeses from around the world.
Dried Fruit, rice and dry bean bins.
They also have a hot food counter with delicious kabobs, hand made flat reds and more.< /text>

Was so excited to find this market near my home after 22 years of living here.  Menu for to go sounded so exciting I couldn't wait!  I order the ribeye skewer plate that says it includes Hummus.  I get home to find pickled veggies  replaced the Hummus.  Very disappointing!!!  If I had known  I could have purchased Hummus separately.   May never go back.<//Text>

Very good store with Indian, Asian, Mexican and Middle -east produce from vegetables, prepared foods, spices, snacks, Dals and variety of tea products are available. Fresh Halal Chicken and Lamb along with sea products are special. They also have a kitchen inside the store making  fresh tandoori Naans, gyros, famous Falafel inside the store is highly recommended .< /Text>

Bad customer service. A cashier named Sandra needs some training about how to be nice, fair and friendly with customers. She needs to change her nasty attitude if she wants to continue working there. Because of this rude and nasty employee, I have to think twice before going shopping at this store. All customers want to be treated with respect such as greetings and pleasant words so that they can have the appetite and desire to come back. Probably the store management doesn’t care about customer service and the future of their business that is why everything is out of control.< /Text>

<Review>All customers: Be Aware!!!
Always check your receipt before you leave the store. It has become a habit for the store cashiers to overcharge customers for items or charge them for wrong items. For example if you buy onions they charge you for peaches. They need to hire knowledgeable and professional employees instead of these rude and ignorant ones.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80d9545aebf43f51:0x304ddb7378e3ce3</gmap_id></record>

Gross! Found so many bugs inside of my red bell peppers (see picture) I’m not sure why this is surprising to me seeing as this store has ALWAYS had bugs, flies, etc. flying around the produce and whatnot. I was always soak any produce I rarely- (thank God) purchase from here in warm water and a drop of vinegar (I would recommend you do the same)</Review>

Excellent meal specials and delicious soft warm bread! Prices are reasonable!  The prices and produce are outstanding.  I enjoyed eating at the new tables so that I could eat the lunch special of chicken and beef kabobs right away!  Friendly and fast service! It's a gem of a place!

Our Lady of Fatima, triumph and reign!< /Text>

UPDATE:   It's been 3 years since the review below and I have brought my car to them for all my car repairs since.  They are the best and truly amazing.   They actually tell me not to worry about items or wait longer before repairs when they could have the business and when they do give you suggested repair, they give you their honest opinion with no pressure at all.   They are the only mechanics I fully trust!

Original Review:
The prices are unbelievably low...worth a drive to stock up.   I don't go there with a shopping list...some of their produce might be a bit past prime, but I always get plenty of fresh items very very cheap.< /Text>

<Text>We've been there a lot of times. It's not the cleanest place for sure, but not the dirtiest as well. They have a good selection of Mideastern and Eastern European goods, not pricey at all. I've never seen any stuff to be rude. Probably you just need to know that some people (nations) are less emotional to strangers, they don't smile as much, but it's ok. Don't think if they have different customs and background, they're rude to you.
Baked stuff and kebobs are very tasty!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Convenient grocery store because it's with in walking distance. Cashier's are always friendly and helpful. Great meat counter, pastries are outstanding. Pastries are filled with veggies, beef or chicken. Personal pizzas are a easy buy and heart for a quick lunch or snack.</Text>

<review>Great little gocery store, but even greater fresh bread section.  It is mesmerizing to watch the baker and his crew in operation, churning out a huge volume of fresh, tasty, flatbreads, pitas, and other treats in real time.  There is often a line of customers waiting patiently for the next batch of too-hot-to-handle bread tossed from a wooden paddle straight from the oven into wooden bins.  There is a small lunch counter that serves great food, including a terrific and HUGE  chicken shawarma sandwich with a price too low to mention.  Well worth going out of your way, even if just to see the bakery in operation.  But get a shawarma while you're there!  There is usually a mobile grill outside the front door selling freshly grilled shishkabobs  - that will be my next stop.<//review><rate>5< /rate><userid>102470913490136483772<//userid><Name>Lawrence Tu</Name><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

I like this place because of all of the cheeses it has and the chicken here is really good too.  I don't know why their chicken tastes so much better from here but they truly have awesome chicken.  Service, there is room for improvement most definitely but the prices are really good. and that outweighs the negatives by far.</review></record></dataset><record>

Rude and ignorant employees especially the cashiers who are uneducated about customer service and I blame management for that because they just don't care. If they do care, we wouldn't see such bad attitudes and unprofessional behaviors on the part of these employees. Cashiers are supposed to be nice and friendly to everyone but in this store most of them are rude and unfriendly.</text>

Great place to get produce, everything is fresh and delicious, and you can often find things (especially Arabic/Mediterranean) there that you might have difficulty finding other places. They'll even sell you things in bulk at a good discount without any fuss, if you ask.< /text>

I agree about the feta cheese. I have never seen so many choices in one place. North Park Produce on EC Blvd has  a flavor and a price for feta that will meet anyone's needs. I'm on a quest to try them all :-) There are many Middle Eastern grocery items, including a humongous selection of oils from olive to avocado; and lots of well-priced produce. But my other favorite part is the kitchwares section. I bought a huge glass teapot for a very low price. My neighbor loves the demitasse coffee sets. I bought some stainless steel bowls for a bargain, also a stainless colander, and a yard-sale priced brand-new ceramic coated lemon squeezer. And the wall of spices is a thing of beauty :-).</Text>

<Text>I went here specifically looking for Indian paneer cheese; found it! Nice selection of Russian foods, Middle Eastern yoghurt drinks, international spices - in brief, many "off-beat" items you won't find in a typical USA supermarket.

Not much "produce" for a produce store, but this store compensates thru interesting variety.  Prices somewhat high, but nice not driving to Kearny Mesa or Mira Mesa for international foods.</Text><name>Peter F</name>< user>

<review>I would give them only one star for the following reasons:

1- Awful customer service. Most of cashiers are rude, impolite and unprofessional.
2- Long waiting line. Sometimes you have to wait for a long time to check out.
3- Small and dirty parking lot.
4- Poor quality produce. Sometimes I see old, dry, and rotten fruits & vegetables.
5- Cashiers sometimes make horrible errors by charging you twice.
6- Cashiers treat customers unfairly.
7- The worse is the owner does nothing to fix the above mentioned problems.

The solution is: Boycott them. Eventually they will close.< /review>< Pictures>

Produce quality is iffy. But lots of variety in greens and ethnic foods. It would get a 3 or 4 except the manager has decided not to allow WIC on Sundays, so impoverished people who have small children may be caught off guard and humiliated.<//Text>

This is my local grocery store and I love it. Produce is very inexpensive here and I often find something interesting that I had never used before. Add to that a fresh meat counter, bulk bins, and deli counter with at least 15 varieties of fetta cheese and NPP has all you need. Plus they treat me like a valued customer on each visit.</review>

Good place for what it is. If you buy lots of vegies and fruits, you can save about 75%  on equally fresh produce to major supermarket. The veriety of imported specialty foods also makes this place a good choice for the frugal, the cultured, and the budget shopper. They are not "Saks or Neiman's" people. We are so used to that phony friendliness in retail that we lose sight of value and availability of rare products this place offers. $9 for cherries at Ralph's comes with a fake smile.< /review>

<UserId.>102330294009146773607< /UserId.><text>This is my go-to place for all kinds of ethnic foods from Asia, Africa and Europe. Among the interesting stuff one can score here are a few types of phyllo pastry (Greece and Turkey) , many kinds of buckwheat and canned fish and mushrooms (Russia, Estonia, Poland), all sorts of Middle Eastern produce and prepared foods, freshly baked breads and a slew of exotic dairy products such as Ryazhenka, Lebni and Kashkaval.
Hands down the best choice of Feta cheese both local and imported.
Produce is OK but not great although there are items that you won't normally find in other stores like for example bulgur and some rare fresh herbs. Butcher has cold and hot smoked mackerel from Norway, which are one of my favorite dinners with some potato salad. Decent quality lamb and goat cuts for curries and North African specialties  and you can find all the spices needed for that as well. Essential spot, really.< /text><rating>4< /rating><gmap_id>0x80d9545aebf43f51:0x304ddb7378e3ce3</gmap_id><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>When I ask if "North Park Produce"  --- who I am replying on  -- "Do you have ___?"
"No I  DON'T. What is it?"
I be asked it I be in debt of info, as NoPaPro not have what I have need of.
But I go ahead a say type of item, only for the sake in case the person will have made an error in not having the barnd name.  But to my loss.< /Text>< Pics>

Had an issue with my radiator and I took it here to get checked out. Really happy with that choice. They did a great job! They did an inspection and found that the radiator was In fact cracked. They found a few other issues upon doing the inspection. They gave us a quote to fix everything, and they were not pushy about it, which was nice. Once all the work was done the price matched the quote that was given, which was also nice. On a side note, I had gotten my tires done elsewhere, and since then there was a rubbing noise on one of them. After getting my car back from the radiator repair, that noise is gone! We will definitely be bringing our other cars here for maintenance and repair.< /review>

So far so good. I had front axles replaced on my 07 Ridgeline. Had a small issue with repair. That's when the service really shined. Very pleased. They really want to do right by the customer.  I'll update you on how it turns out.
3/20 Well, got the truck back. All is perfect. Provided OEM parts option. So refreshing finding a local service center that gives large dealer results with personal flavor, without the feeling that their raking you over the coals.
Thank You Dan.<//Review>

< Review>
I have come here for my past three oil changes and every time I have left happy with the great customer service they have offered I really like the quality of the work and they have a website which counts your rewards. Dan is a very nice guy and has been very accommodating to me because I had to reschedule my oil change appointment twice already but he was always willing to help me out.</Review>

It was my first time coming to this auto shop. I had a check engine light that needs to be addressed so they set me up an appointment. When I came in for my appointment, they did a thorough check on my car and gave me the estimate on how much the fix would cost. Yes, it got pricey but they were reasonable about the price. They did a great job on my car. I will be back for sure.<//text>

<Review>As my usual mechanic was closed due to the pandemic I had to find someone soon as I had an obvious brake issue.  I checked Yelp and read many reviews of several mechanics.  In the end I narrowed it down to two and chose the one closest to me in case I had to run home.  I emailed Dependable Car Care with my concern and he got back to me almost immediately.  We set an appointment for the following day.

I dropped off the car and met Dan, the owner.  He was kind, thoughtful and informational.  He called me within a couple of hours and gave me the diagnosis and estimate.  I gave him the go ahead to make the repair.  After a few hours he called and informed me that the car was ready for pick-up.  My brake system is now functioning properly and I feel confident in driving the vehicle.

While picking up the car we started talking about various subjects and I found him to be quite personable and friendly.  The other thing that I like has been his post service follow up.  I believe that I made the right choice in selecting this mechanic shop.  I look forward to bringing in my other car soon.<//Review>< Date>

I initially found Dependable Car Care online, after moving to the area and needing work on my car. I saw the high reviews and took a chance. Being a woman, I've had so many places try and take advantage of me, but they lived up to all the great things people said online. It's an amazing place, where they value the customer, do great work, and make everything as easy as possible. And they guarantee their work. They're also just really nice people. I highly recommend them.</Text>

< review>
I have been a loyal customer for a few years because they always treat me with respect, and they get the job done correctly. I always know my car is in good hands when I drop it off. I never have to call to tell them the job didn't get done right. It is always done right. The service from the crew is professional, and always done in a timely manner.
They keep great tabs on your car so you know what needs and could be done the next time. You will never be surprised if something goes wrong because they are on top of it. I highly recommend them.<//review>

I wish I could rate this place more than 5 stars. Dan & his team are outstanding! When I had sudden engine failure on the road, I was referred to Dan through my Carmax warranty and I am so happy that I was. When i talked to Dan, I was crying & scared and he went out of his way to find a tow truck company to come "rescue" me.  I wasn't even a client yet and he was bending over backwards for me! Once we figured out what was wrong, he explained everything in detail and made it easy for me to understand, as someone with little to no car experience. Never tried to upsell me on anything but stayed honest with what I needed for safety. He has a lifetime customer now. Highly recommended!< /Text>

Dependable Car Care is the only place I bring my car. I've never trusted another mechanic  like I do to them. They are honest and trustworthy and I never doubt that I'm getting the best service possible. Their customer service is top-notch. They are always friendly and accommodating, as I usually need a ride back to work when I drop my car off. Their time frame is always workable, their old work is efficient and economical. I recommend to anybody I talk to to bring their car to them. Dan and his group of mechanics are the best in the business.< /Text>

<Name>Kasie Maguire<//Name><text>I left town for 10 months and came back to a completely dead hybrid. I took it in to Dependable Car Care, and they got my 2002 Honda Insight back on the road in no time at all! It's even getting better MPG than before.

Everyone is super friendly and their service is extremely thorough. Not only did they coax the hybrid battery back to life, they did a full maintenance inspection and service to take care of any other issues down the road. And I received detailed updates every step of the way.

I would definitely recommend DCC to anyone looking for a good mechanic, especially if you have a hybrid or EV.</text><gmap_id>0x80e84ca93278ccf5:0x3af6836913e17340< /gmap_id>< Resp>

Dan and the guys at Dependable Car Care hands down the best-run operation and experience ive had with a mechanic. Took the car in for a tune-up, had multiple services taken care of. Car was then worked on by Ford dealer immediately after. Got the car back and was not accelerating correctly, took it back to Dan who found the fault and fixed free of charge.

Honest mechanic and good service, you will be taken care of at Dependable Car Care!</text>

John was very understanding about my situation and got my vehicle back up and running when my other mechanic can't.
They gave me a complete diagnoses on what wrong with my vehicle and a price before work can begin.
Very professional and got the job done in a timely matter.
Looks like I found a new home to take care of all my vehicle needs.

Thanks to Dan and John for a great Job well done!!!<//review>

Dan and his team did a stellar job on my vehicle from start to finish.
I brought my Ford Fusion in for what I suspected was a need for brakes. It has a little over 100,000 miles on it, but has never had any kind of major service. Sure enough it needed brakes, but Dan's inspection identified several other crucial maintenance needs.
They performed them in a swift and professional manner, communicating with me throughout the process.
Top-notch service.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>TRUE customer service is severely lacking in the business world these days. As consumers, we are desensitized to long wait times, businesses not listening to customer complaints, and a haphazard shopping experience.

My wife and I have been doing business with Dependable Car Care since 2014. There was only one time in our 4 years of service that we were not 100% satisfied. Due to us being desensitized by poor customer service - we decided it was BEST to cut our losses and find another brand to trust our vehicles too.

But Dan, Owner of Dependable Car Care reached out to us before we pulled the trigger. Dan did what most businesses around the world are failing to do these days. Dan listened to my wife. Dan validated my wife's shopping experience, apologized for the error, and together we found a solution.

This action meant a lot to my wife and I. If you believe in TRUE customer service and you are currently unsatisfied with your current automotive experience - I suggest taking your car to Dependable Car Care. Have Dan and his team take a look at it for you. Because I can honestly vouch that Dependable Car Care is a TRUE champion for customer service.

I found Dependable Car Care over a year ago when I sought a mechanic to do the major tune-up on my 2000 Toyota Tundra.  This vehicle was purchased new and I have meticulously serviced it over the years by Toyota's service recommendations. Over the years I have used several different servicing centers in Northern California.  Dependable Care’s workman ship and thoroughness has been exceptional. For example, the carburetor cleaner that was used for the major tune-up not only helped my engine run more smoothly, but also increased my gas mileage.  It was a pleasure to come back and have an oil change and then review with Dan items that were functioning fine and those in time that needed to be evaluated.  I have been very satisfied with the thoroughness and the professional that I have received.  I highly recommend Dependable Car Care.</review>

For those who are not knowledgeable with cars like myself it is always difficult to know if you are getting a fair price and service.
That is why I always come back to this team. Each time I have worked with them they have been courteous, informative, fair, and honest.
I appreciate that more than anything else.< /Review>

Thanks Dan and Charles!!!

They stayed in touch with me and arranged for a rental car that afternoon (covered by my warranty).  Mike even had an Uber pick me up after work and take me to Enterprise so that I didn't have to wait longer.  For a middle school teacher on a Friday, that was such a fantastic thing!

Dependable fixed my initial problem and also a brewing brake issue within a few days.  They also installed the wipers that I'd struggled with the weekend before (yes, I've installed on other cars but struggled with this one).  Rain came literally seconds after I left their shop on Tuesday!  Car was running and stopping perfectly!

I have never even thought to write a positive review for an auto shop, but I will bring my vehicle back to Dependable and recommend to others.<//review></record>

Super friendly service! I went in for just an oil change, but the complimentary check up caught quite a few safety issues with my car! They explained everything in detail and simple language which was refreshing.< /Review>

<review>ATTENTION ✋✋✋✋✋  This place deserves no STARS AT ALL!!.... if you need a reliable place that will fix your car, Good and equal price then take it to your car dealer it's way cheaper, AND don't take it here.  I took my car here and they fixed it, a week later it broke down completely and they said they would fix it, but they didnt so i took it back and paid even more tgan i did before, my car sounds bad and breaks down regularly.... honestly I believe they make your car worse so you take it back the second time.... without my knowledge my wife took her car as well and they where just doing a check up trying to see if things are wrong, but when she brought the car back every light that NEVER came on,  STARTED  to come on... and there again they made a problem so you can go back and they could fix it for you.... PEOPLE PLEASE DON'T TAKE YOUR CAR HERE, take it to your dealer .< /review>< Pictures>

We decided to stop in for fresh  doughnuts. (Yay!) We live in the country where these places just are not around. We were the only ones in the shop. We were pleasantly greeted at the door. "Good Morning."
- "why yes it is. And about to get better."
As the sweet smell of fresh doughnuts wafting through the air.
The menu is more than a doughnut shop menu.
- what bagels and lox with ALL the good stuff? I would like one of those as well!
The gal at the register gave us our couple doughnuts and we paid for all we ordered. She attendant started working on my bagel order. Then the whole experience took a HARD LEFT!
Started getting busy... 1 customer, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 customers  we are still waiting for a simple bagel and lox. 20 min later went to counter and asked "How much longer?" Response... 20 min. Wait... excuese me? I'd like my money back. I have been waiting patiently already for 20 minutes. What do I get for a response? Money slammed on the counter with a slammed cash register! Wow! Needless to say we left and will not be back ever. Customer service is severely lacking. Too bad. Great concept for doughnut shop. Horrible Horrible at tasking.<//Text>< rating>

<review>Putting 2 stars here cause at least the donuts are good. Customer service was subpar, was asked to leave while choosing donuts. This was due to covid measures, which I understand, but there were other people behind me in line who could have been asked to wait outside instead of me, who was there before everyone else.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>If you are looking for a good cup of coffee and excellent doughnuts that opens early; this is the doughnut shop you'll enjoy. The shop is clean; and very reasonable priced. You can enjoy your purchase there or to go.
I blissfully enjoyed an apple fritter and cup of coffee.
The owners are happy to see you and greet you with a smile; a good way to start the day.</Text>< Pictures>

The people here are very courteous and friendly.  It is a family owned establishment with a second location in Pine Grove and a Pizza store also in Pine Grove. They serve most of the areas needs daily and their very innovative in regards to new never before seen creations like the Bacon Maple Bar and Blueberry Fritter. Crazy good.<//text>

The owner/operator looks like Brian May from Queen.  Totally helpful and did not gouge me on the price. He offered me the coupon even though I didn’t have one. I will definitely  bring my car back.</Review>< pics>

I have a 94 Aoir Star , they don't smog older cars or vans. It's hard to find any mechanic who is willing to work on my car in Thousand Oaks<//Text>

I called a few minutes after their official hours and not only did the owner answer but he accommodated me and squeezed me in and stayed an extra 15 minutes to finish up with my car.

The staff is courteous, kind, patient, knowledgeable and accommodating. This service is so convenient! If the vehicle passes smog, they transmit the certificate directly to the DMV. All I have to do is pay my registration fee on the DMV website and wait for the tags to be mailed. I have been getting my smog checks here for years and will continue to do so as long as I am in the area. Thank you, Samer, for excellent service year after year!< /Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Had our 2008 Chrysler Town and County smog tested and all went as planned.  They were efficient and charged the state mandated fees.  The workers wore masks as expected.  Only issue, is the technician removed his mask while backing out our car from the service bay.  Put the mask back on when he exited the car.  Does this seem right?< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Extremely helpful,saved me a lot of $$ having to possibly take to a mechanic. Have 06 Chevy equinox which is known for problems. My service engine soon light on 2 yrs. I replaced O2 sensors,gas cap,cleaned throttle body,cleaned engine. Didn't pass. He took apart few things found simple vacuum leak tightened screw OMG fixed!!!
They have helped me 6 yrs now.

I had failed a previous SMOG test, due to an aftermarket air intake, and I took my car here for a second opinion. The gentleman at Discount Smog confirmed the problem, explained how to look up the exemption info for the part, and gave me a number to call for help with the repair costs. He was exceedingly friendly and helpful, and to top it off, he didn't charge me. My only regret is that I didn't go here first! Absolutely top notch service. Thanks again!<//text>

< Review>
I called the shop and the owner was available that night to do it.  Couldn't have asked for more.  Got there about an hour or so before closing and he fit me in.  Very grateful and appreciative of his service because I didn't have to schedule an appointment.  This was on a Friday night and it saved my weekend plans.</Review>

<review>I agree with the other positive reviews.  It is the only place I will take my cars for smog (we have four, and seem to be taking at least one in each year to have done).

They are so good (and fair) that after the first few times going there I stopped nickle and diming them with their coupons.  I just go in, and I know it will get done right and quickly.  If you do have a problem they will even give you ideas on what to possibly look at.

Fantastic honest place.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1570150276823, 'text': 'We appreciate your nice words about Discount Smog.'}< /Resp>< Time>

<Text>When I was living in simi valley, California, Sam was my trusted source when it comes to my car repair, because he is honest and helpful. I trusted no one but Discount Smog, I, not only went there for smog but also for advise when I needed an honest and good mechanic. I like Sam and his professional way of dealing with people. Thank you Sam for all the help.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><Resp>{'time': 1474909155146, 'text': 'Thanks Colette for a wonderful review. God bless you.'}<//Resp>< user_id>

These people deserve a review they were sooo awesome, friendly and knowledgeable I felt excited about shopping for vitamins now that's a heck of a statement. It's hard to locate some of the items because they have a ton of products but if you just ask them they will definitely help you out. I also got a subscription that will deliver some of the new supplements to my house, through them. Thanks guys for helping me stay in good health:)</review>

<review>These guys have zero knowledge of what they sell
They are selling their products simply based on the price. If it cost more then it must be better. When I asked a question about something that they had no clue about they answered, "oh, I think it was discontinued". A product that is currently thriving.. This is why people are buying everything online now. Sad but true.< /review>< Pics>

Jonathan was very, very rude. First of all, I wasn't  greeted upon coming in the store. Second  of all, once I retrieved  my merchandise and  proceeded to the counter I STILL wasn't greeted,  I was asked  if I had a phone  number, so I sarcastically  said  hello how are you? It was so ironic  because 2 Hispanic women  walked  in and he goes..." Hey guys welcome " so I immediately asked if he only greeted Latinos.  I have been coming to this establishment for about a year and I have never ever been treated like this . I am totally dissatisfied ,Jonathan's customer service and I definitely will be contacting corporate and I would never ever ever revisit this location. I will be taking my money to GNC from this point on.< /Text>

Horrible and disgusting customer service! They sold me an open box of keto cookies that was taped closed. My wife didn’t realize it was opened until she left the store. When she got home she saw that it was previously opened and some packages of cookies were missing. Yet these guys thought it was funny to tape the box closed so we wouldn’t notice. To make matters worse, when I called to complain the depraved guy that answered the phone refused to listen and had a major attitude! I Never had problems with other locations but they definitely need to fire the staff working here.</text>

Never leave the store empty handed meaning Blake's always has what I'm looking for not to mention the expert advice, service and customer care the folks at Blake's provide. Possibly the best hardware store in the North County.<//Text>

Make Blake's your first stop! The always knowledgeable, helpful staff make purchasing home remodeling supplies a breeze. If your project needs it, they are most likely to have it on hand.<//review>

<UserId.>109705374422067826233</UserId.><Text>Worst customer service. Not knowing operating hours I walked through the door and was greeted by a blonde female, who had the demeanor of a gulag prison guard, with the the words "three minutes". Nothing else. I quickly located the part I need and proceeded to the check stand only to find my not so friendly comrade. She rang me up and said "$9.69". Not another word. No thank you, no kiss my posterior, nothing. I like to patronize local businesses but Blake's apparently does not care for my business so I will avoid returning.<//Text>< user_name>

< Review>
This is a small hardware store but everytime I have needed something this place has it. Not only that but the people who work there are friendly and helpful. But willing to offer suggestions when you have a project and not sure if you are doing it correctly. Compared to the big box stores they are little more expensive and may not have as much as them but at least I don't have to wander around looking for someone to help me for ten minutes.<//Review>

A word of advice. Don't ever make fun of a paying customer! I went in there to buy alot of stuff and the older woman starts talking to her employees laughing at me. I have a disability and they made fun of me! I will never shop in your store again and I will tell all my friends about how you treat customers!< /text>

I ordered 1000 business cards, came with wrong font (tiny). Tried to resolve problem but they just stopped responding to insistence that I needed a replacement with easily legible font ie larger. I have since written to Samara ( a supervisor, I believe) who has chosen to ignore my correspondence. No word, No solution. Do Not Recommend< /Text>

NextDayFlyers went above and beyond my expectations! Being a newbie to creating packaging for my products, NextDayFlyers helped every step of the way. When one of the images I uploaded turned out blurry, customer service contacted me immediately. I was worried that my mistake would cost me time but they did not move my project to the back of the line. Instead, once the correct file was sent, they got to work. The finished product is exactly what I wanted, actually, better than I expected!! I will be using them again and again.<//review>

A few weeks ago, I ordered wedding invitations for my daughter. They turned out beautifully and the order was to me in under a week from start to finish. Less expensive than Costco and comes with the envelopes too. I have 3 more weddings to go and will definitely be looking here first. Also, I am going to order the thank you cards from here.
This was an older post. Since then, I have ordered for 2 more weddings and they have been FANTASTIC! Very pleased.</Text>

I have been using the NEXT DAY FLYERS services for over 4 years for my clients and they have all always met the clients expectations in quality cardstock, ink coverage, cuts, and customer service. If there is an issue or problem they are very quick to respond with a favorable solution to still assure the project gets done and delivered as soon as its updated by either party whom may be responsible. They are accessible via phone, email, and online chat and have quick turnaround in responding. For flyers, Business cards, postcards, brochure, I recommend!< /text>

<Text>My bookmarks came out great, but, A color on my logo was not quite right.
It was to be red and I chose from the color chart one that looked like the red I wanted.  The bookmark came with an  orange color.  When I called I was told the color on the screen is not always accurate.  It would have been good to know that in advance so I could get help before ordering.  If I order again I hope we can work out the correct color.</Text><response>None</response>< pictures>

<review>Labels arrived earlier which was great! Looked great and easy to apply to small water bottles. I did a test putting a labeled bottle into a container of water for over an hour! Labels adhered to bottles and the message wasn't smeared or ruined afterlater being in coolers of ice all day! The labeled bottles were a hit with my Pastor & others who attended our Family & Friends Day! This was great outreach tool & we'll use more soon!</review><rating>5< /rating>< time>

Super fast delivery, excellent communication and quality control. After trying for a month to get a banner printed by a competitor company with ZERO communication on their part, I found Next Day flyers. They contacted me within HOURS about a formatting mistake I had made with my file I uploaded. I corrected it, and they had it printed and mailed hours later! And saved me the embarrassment and waste of $$$ from my mistake. So glad they were concerned to make sure I was happy. The digital 'proofs' on the website were an excellent touch too. I only wish they offered more variety of sizes for the banners (different aspect ratios) and offered the ability to print on fabric. Hopefully in the future.< /review>

These guys have some of the best quality and pretty good turn around time for decent prices. HOWEVER... It is like pulling teeth to get your design through the system. I have sent files 5 times each time making the proper corrections, I have also called them 6 times and have not received very much help. Great place if you don't mind pulling your hair.</Text>

I am VERY happy with my experience with NextDayFlyers. Our wedding announcements turned out perfectly! And they came in the mail even quicker than projected. I have been recommending NextDayFlyers to all of my friends because I am so happy with the product and the service!< /review>

They are always on schedule (which is amazingly fast), their online chat and real people on their toll free # are always knowledgeable and responsive.  We are able to do so much more for super reasonable prices than I would have ever guessed possible for a small non-profit organization. Because of their pricing and speed and variety of products, things we used to produce in-house (and poorly), I just send now to them and the professionalism of our collateral has increased tremendously - because we can - because of NDF.<//review><user_id>108576149559326153116< /user_id>< date>

I've used Next Day Flyers a few times and am always impressed with the quality. I needed more flyers for an event at short notice and they were delivered on time. I will use this company again.</review>

I have been using NextDayFlyers for over a year, ordering from them on average once or twice a month, and they have been flawless with their communication, delivery and quality.  I t seems all the low marks are from years past so I recommend you give them a try and see why I am am a loyal customer.< /Review>

<text>Horrible Experience.  We do a lot of printing, and decided to give these guys a try.  Followed their instructions to the letter, and we ended with a product that is unusable.  No proof given (they said we waived proof, which isn't the case).   Horrible customer service experience.  They could have gained a lifelong customer.  I guess some businesses just don't get it.  Their loss.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dd34c9634d3669:0x2e640d7d6762d0a1</GmapID></record>

I like most of the customer service representative such as Cherish. However, the proofing process made me wait over and over again. I experienced terrible customer service from Zuzze. I know they are not using their real name, but I am sure the other customer might experience the similar experience from Zuzze. I wouldn't consider doing business with them unless you have a lot of time spending on rushing their proofing team and just waiting for the email to notify you about the proof.< /review><rating>1< /rating><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

I have been using these guys for years and have never had issues until now. I am now calling every single day for my order. It has been 8 days since I ordered and each day I am told, tomorrow it will be ready. This is ridiculous. I am sad as I really felt they were good. Their service has slipped big time. Very disappointing....<//review>

EPIC FAILS - I tried them twice. Looking to give a fair shake. The Saddle Brook NJ facility is horrible. The people don't seem too concerned.

The first time, they mis-shipped an item LATE. The second time, I asked for next day service (and paid extra). When I sent my guy to pick up the order (2 days later) they said they were 'waiting for my proof approval'. Then, within 30 seconds, a proof approval request lands in my email.

Customer service was VERY nonplussed. They said they could 'upgrade me' to same day for ONLY 29 extra dollars...

what? I cancelled both orders I had in house.<//review>

The new process is HORRIBLE! I have done business with next day for a couple of years but the new management and not being able to speak with ANYONE at the actual facility is very frustrating. The staff at the "call center" are not knowledgeable at all on procedures, services or products and must place you on hold to ask menial questions. Also alot of the best features about the Rancho Dominquez office have been taken away due to this merger or whatever...so I will be looking for a new place of business STAT so that I can have better customer service overall. It was nice while it lasted Next Day!

*I wish I could rate in NEGATIVE NUMBERS...< /Review>

< Review>
Headlight bulb went out on my Hybrid Rav. I stopped here to purchase a new bulb. I was assisted by a very helpful, polite, personable fellow named Eli. He identified the part I needed and saved me money by telling me that it was cheaper to buy a twin pack of bulbs, which was accurate. He even kindly offered to replace the bulb. All in all i was in and out of the store within 10 minutes. I will definitely return to this store and ask for Eli should I need auto parts.< /Review>

< Review>
So I called to make sure they had what I was looking for. I live close so it would have been convenient. It was just bad from the second I walked in. The kid behind the counter said you have to wear a mask. I said it is not a law. He said it's company policy. I wanted to ask if he knew the law regarding wearing a mask while conceal carrying a weapon, but I would be in violation of offering that information. So I left to never return EVER!  A nieve employee or person will always be. To bad I came in spend money and that employee caused that to not happen. Funny thing is I have a hot rod project that would require alot of parts but not from AutoZone.<//Review>

My brother and I were on a long road trip passing through when our car had transmission problems. We stopped here because all the local mechanics were closed. Caesar and Eli were very kind, informative, and professional in helping us with our problem. Thank you, these guys have a great team.< /Text>

Helpfull and nice staff. AutoZone has most the things you want in a auto parts store. Nothing bad to say.... the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is.... I'm never excited to go.< /Review>

<text>Ask to purchase or a loaner tool to remove a part. Mario (AutoZone employee) assisted me. I was shown on a chart various tools available for the job. I didn’t know the exact tool I needed so he said use a wrench. I told him it took a special tool and he rudely said like I was a complete dummy to use a wrench. I ask him to not be so rude to me I’m asking for help either purchasing this tool or a loaner. He was very rude with an attitude! I asked him a few times to cool it with his temperament, he continued with his rudeness. So I told him I was going to make a complaint and he told me to leave. Mario has no patience and customer skills. Don’t recommend anyone to go to AutoZone after this experience.  There are other parts stores that are much more friendlier and would welcome my business.< /text>< pictures>

WOW.. WHAT A JOKE.. Went to Rosedale Store for a part. They didn't have the part I needed so the cashier called the Olive Drive Store to confirm that the part was available. The Olive Drive Store had it so we headed over. When I arrived 3 associates were standing doing absolutely nothing.  I said that Rosedale called and I was there to pick up a part. All 3 looked at each other and said nothing.. After waiting 10 min the chic nods her head and says I'm ready. Not once did anyone say Thank you for coming in.  Thank you for your business. NOTHING..<//review>

Having had braces twice before, Dr. Redmond has been the best orthodontics doctor that I’ve seen. He has been very kind from the beginning of this process. Making everything easy while helping straighten my teeth with aligners. The staff is also awesome, very patient, and they work so well with your schedule! I personally love that I get a text message sent to remind me of my appointments (I think it’s a great bonus!). I always recommend BRO for any orthodontic needs.</Text>

<Review>Both of my children have received orthodontic treatment from Dr. Bill Redmond.  He is skilled, personable, and fun!  He provides excellent care and strives to connect with each patient on a personal level.  Dr. Bill Redmond and his team also go above and beyond to make a contributions to their community.  I would highly recommend BRO Orthodontics!< /Review>< Time>

The thing we love most about BRO is that Dr. Bill made the effort to bond with our 8-year-old at the beginning of the process. It could have been scary for him but instead he looks forward to his appointments. The whole staff is friendly and efficient. Go BRO!< /review>

Dr. BILL is the best I thought everybody already knew
If you or your child or your friend or your cousin or your uncle or anybody you know needs braces this is the place to go
From pricing to patient care to results all five stars

Both of my boys went to Dr. bill and my daughter will do the same<//Review>

Dr. Bill and his staff are outstanding! When my daughter went in for her first consultation he waited for over a year to put her braces on.  He is very honest and trustworthy. The experience overall with Dr. Bill and his staff has been amazing.< /review>

BRO is truly the best. Not only is Dr. Redmond an incredible orthodontist, his staff is also one of a kind. Not only have they walked my 12 year old (and I) through the step by step process of braces, but they’ve always been accommodating to me when my 4 year old comes along to appointments!! I feel so very lucky that we crossed paths and are part of the BRO family.<//Text>

<Review>Direct diagnosis and explanations of services required.

Customer service is very friendly. Employees work overtime to allow patients to after hours treatment. They perform their duties without expressing
any negative attitude.

Prices were direct and based off of their analysis, plus no haggling occurred.

Scheduled an appointment that morning and received my initial scans for invsaline within an hour of arriving at the office.

Affordable payment plans are offered.

So far, I haven't had any hidden fees thrown my way since starting treatment.

Thorough brief for treatments. Be sure you listen and bring a highlighter mark important information.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

So glad I bought my daughter to Dr. Bill!  He is a perfectionist as well as an artist. It's extremely apparent from your first visit that Dr. Redmond and his staff care about you as a person. They are easy to work with on rescheduling and the waiting room should be called a sitting room because we never have to wait!  That's my kind of orthodontist!  You'd be crazy to go anywhere else.< /review>

Dr. Bill is amazing; I recommend him without any hesitation. I have a son with down Syndrome and sensory issues. We had seen a different Ortho for a while who was beyond insensitive to my son and didn't even correct his dental issues so when we were searching for a new Ortho to start over, I did a lot of research and interviewing. Dr. Bill has gone above and beyond expectations: he made several house calls (yes, really!), took extra time at each appointment, really got to know my son and made him feel so comfortable. Now my son, who was initially terrified of orthodontist appointments, is calm and compliant and always looks forward to seeing Dr. Bill! We are so grateful for him and his very kind staff!< /Text>

<Text>First of all, Dr. Redmond is a great guy, and super nice. Unfortunately, his treatment contributed to bone loss in the condyles of my mandible, facial pain, intrusion of my molars, and the narrowing of my face and jaw, among other problems. I am now, many years later, undergoing functional orthodontics to correct the work he and other traditional orthodontists did. Every day I'm in less pain and my face improves as my prior treatment is reversed. I do not mean to be inflammatory or disparaging. I have no doubt that Dr. Redmond wants the best possible outcomes for his patients. However, my diagnosis was incorrect and resulted in a poor outcome that only got worse over time.</Text>< Pictures>

Dt. Bill Redmond is THE top orthodontist! Our family has known Dr. Bill for many years, his work is not only the best but most compassionate. If you are looking for an orrhodontist...this team is worth the drive from anywhere in southern Cal. Thanks BRO for all you do.

<Text>My Airbnb host booked this plumber to come out to fix a hot water issue for the showers. The plumber that arrived was confused to how plumbing worked and asked us questions like “how was this caused?” Which is ironic since that’s why we called him... after spending 2 hours in our Airbnb he got so flustered he took his mask off and started entering rooms while girls were changing without knocking to go to the showers.  He then said “I can’t fix these showers- they are European showers so someone else has to come out... don’t worry I’ll talk to your Airbnb host” then as I tried to handle the situation with the host .. the Airbnb hosts said that the plumber said that 1. The water in the showers were hot when he arrived and 2. That it was working fine when he left. That was complete rubbish and now I have a HORRIFIC review on my Airbnb account and no refund for the 24 hours without hot water in the showers.. all because the plumber LIED.</Text>< pics>

The installation was conducted by Casey (no relation), he showed me how the unit operated and went through the test results from all the water faucets within the house. Lastly we discussed maintenance requirements for the product and were done in less than 2 hours.  This was a very professional installation and I couldn't be happier with the service.<//Review>< Pictures>

Once before we had an issue and he talked me through it on the phone and I swore if we ever needed anything again I’d use them. Great customer service and excellent execution.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Communication with office and the technician was very clear, friendly, yet professional. Was able to get an appt the next day to uncap a gas line so that the dryer could be connected. The other issue was a toilet valve that screeched when water was used in room.  Both jobs  were simple and done quickly. were taken care of quickly once the work started. The cost was outragous, however. It was $580 for these two tasks and a quick look at my garbage dispoal turned it on and agreed that it didn’t sound good and should be replaced and  kind looking at the the connection to my sprinkler system for 5 min or less. That said, the  quality of the work that he did do was excellent, except for installing parts to the gas line that did not fit the hose that came with the dryer.  I had left it with the dryer and mentioned that the delivery guy said that he might have to use an adapter for it to work. It took two trips to Home Depot and buy additional parts to make it work. I am not mad about any of it, but will probably take my chances with another company next time.</Text>

Called these guys because a plumber friend recommended them to me and I can’t thank them enough. Came after hours, 20+ miles out of the way (I’m in the middle of nowhere) and after what I am sure was the longest day at 9pm, Jesse came and fixed everything. I was pretty unglued after six hours of trying to find someone, cleaning up a flood, running to the store to try DIY remedies, and Jesse giving me a few minutes on the phone to try on my own again - even offering advice so I wouldn’t break something. My mood was less than stellar and he remained calm and patient the entire time. Also great with wearing a mask and distancing which is most appreciated! Thank you - I will recommend this company anytime. Thorough follow up with dispatch checking in and follow up call the next morning as well. THIS is how you run a business!<//Review>

Marco was excellent in his professional diligence in searching the source of the problem, making considerable effort in identifying the origin of a clog in the sewer line. He was considerate and kind and respectful.
I will strongly recommend KC 23 1/2 in the future.< /Review>

We always use KC's plumbing and they always deliver. This time Jesse showed up and he was courteous, professional, and got the problem resolved in short order. Unfortunately for us the issue was a little more significant and required clearing out some roots from the main pipe, but soon everything was working again. We would recommend KC's Plumbing to anyone who has plumbing issues.< /review>

He is a credit to your organization and a real professional.  Get the man a raise :).

<text>Our water heater decided to flood our garage on Sunday at 4PM!  After turning off the hot water for the evening we waited until the next morning and called the company the home warranty company said was to help per the contract.  I was informed that I would have to wait until they called ME to schedule an appointment.  Three hours later they finally called and said I could be seen the FOLLOWING MONDAY!

Umm NO!

I called KC's 23 1/2 Hour Plumbing and Amber informed me that she could have a tech out that afternoon!  Yay.  An hour later she called me and said he had finished his previous job and could come right then if we were available.  Of course!  Well Abraham showed up 20 minutes later.  After reviewing the water heater and discussing our options, it was time to invest in a new one.  He said let me run to the warehouse and get it, you will have hot water tonight!  He was gone 30 minutes and returned with the new water heater.  He then replaced our old one, cleaned out the area that had been damaged by the leak, installed the new water heater (with copper piping!) and removed the old heater for recycling.  The water was running hot before he left for the evening.  Abraham did an amazing job and was extremely considerate in making sure we were helped and happy.  He was extremely knowledgeable and informative and if we have any plumbing issues in the future we will be sure to call KC's and request him for any service we might need.

When all was said and done we might have overpaid for the water heater but we paid for the convenience of getting hot water running again in less than 24 hours after disaster and for us it was worth every cent.<//text>< Time>

Dana my technician recommended replacing my entire water heater when all he needed to do was RE-light pilot - not sure if this was ignorance or malice but either way I would never recommend this technician or company. Furthermore I asked to speak to a supervisor, who never called me...

The technician told me the “pilot assembly” wasn’t working properly, and the part wouldn’t be available until Monday (this was Friday evening at a vacation rental, so I wanted to get my guests hot water ASAP).

Turns out Ferguson’s carries this part, so even if the assembly was faulty, I could have gotten it Saturday morning (which I did).

Furthermore, the water heater is under warranty, so the part would have been free if it were faulty (which it wasn’t), but Dana didn’t take the time to check that either.

Worse even still is that all I had to do was RE-light the pilot light (I called the water heater company and their 24/7 customer service department walked me through how to do it).

I have called this company before and they didn’t take advantage of my on that call, but this experience was the worse experience I have ever had with a plumber. They knew I was in a pinch and desperate to get the water hot and instead of just re-lighting the pilot they wanted to sell me an entire new hot water heater :’(<//Text>

<review>Called them and spoke to the plumber describing our specific problem. He arrived within 30 mins and fixed the clog almost immediately. He then suggested a way for us to upgrade our almost 50yo plumbing so this never happens again and gave us a quote to do the work. Very professional plumbing company.

<review>I had shopped several cooling and heating companies to replace a bad heat pump.
They were unable to quote me a clear and precise quote for replacement .
I made a phone call to a company called Pricefixer and requested a service call. The technician, Anthony Ramos, showed up at my door within the hour. He explained the options available and was very patient. He told me to think about it and to get back with him. Also, there was no charge for his service call.
I am pleased that I had the opportunity to meet such a conscientious technician.
We agreed on terms and I had Anthony replace the heat pump. Happy with the installation and I would recommend him without question.

Thank you Anthony......<//review>< pictures>

He also took his time to explain the way how they charge for the services and materials which I highly appreciate. After he finish his job he show me what was done and how it works.

We’d been having problems with leaks under the kitchen sink. The KC technician found that the new garbage disposal (installed by another company) had not been hooked up to the sink, etc., correctly. He fixed the original problem and the issues that had arisen because of the faulty installation.
The technician was competent, explained the problems and fixed them. We are relieved—and pleased with this company. I recommend them.< /review>

<text>What a great company; outstanding customer service, fantastic staff and absolutely honest.
I never review anyone on first impression. That being said, KC's has come through for me repeatedly, and at times Out of Pocket. You tell me what companies still care enough about there service to do that?
KC's, you are note worthy and I must say; you have warranted all my business.
Kudos and thank you for always coming through.< /text>< pics>

<text>Chris was very personable and helpful. Very professional!
He went out of his way to help and answer questions with other issues I had under my house they weren’t directly related to plumbing!
I would appreciate if you would thank him for me again, and his co worker also. He was also very professional !!</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Casey arrived right on time.  He is extremely professional, customer-center and very friendly and outgoing.  Repair was completed and the area he worked in was left spotless.  Great job as usual.  Could not be more pleased.< /Review>

I only gave 4 stars because it took 3 calls for the technician to actually show up.  There was some sort of communication breakdown in their dispatch.  That being said, once the plumber finally arrived he worked quickly and accurately, and I'm quite pleased with the final results.<//Review>

KC’s 23 1/2 hour plumbing was very professional from the very beginning with my discussion with Amber, who was very polite and professional, to Chris who made the necessary repairs as well helped set up a future appointment as well.  I would highly recommend KC’s 23 1/2 hour plumbing and will utilize them for our future needs.<//review>

< Review>
I've used KC Plumbing in 2019 to repair our tankless water heater.  At that time, Casey, my tech/plumber mentioned the HS-40 hydroflow water treatment system and this month we decided to replace our salt based water softener with the hydroflow.  We believe this technology to be an improved option and a better environmental consideration.<//Review>

I had a very good experience from the time I called to the time my slow draining kitchen sink was fixed. I appreciated that I was given options for the repair vs being pushed into the highest cost service. I highly recommend this company.<//text>

Once again KC 23 and 1/2 hour plumbing came through amazingly.
My home warranty company completely failed at  finding an honest and decent contractor that would take care of our hot water leak. There was nobody available to come for 5 days, even after repeatedly informing  them that we had to shut the water off completely for the duration. There was no water in the house for 5 days.
The only good thing that my home warranty company Total Protect/Crosscountry did, is to give me the phone number for KC Plumbing. The KC Plumbing unfortunately does not work with my warranty company anymore because the warranty company failed to pay them.  I spoke to Tina and she was amazing and so kind. She scheduled the plumbers for the next day, the gentlemen  took care of the broken pipe  and in a fast and very professional way, for an absolutely reasonable price.
These people are amazing, compassionate and professional..

Thank you Tina, the gentlemen who came to do the repair ( I am sorry I didn't get the names) and thank you KC 23 and 1/2 hour Plumbing.<//Review>

Kyle was very friendly and easy to talk to. Answered all my questions with knowledge and made me feel like family. Being a first time home owner and not knowing who to turn to I'm glad i found KC's. The price point is also excellent coming from someone who is on a budget and I now have great plumbing service I can count on if ever I need it.

It was a hot day with degrees at 113 during the day and 108 at night. At around 10pm I was only getting warm air through my vents in the house and the temp was escalating upward towards 90 in the house, and I had the thermostat set to 76. I immediately called Pricefixer The Technician Noe arrived at my house in minutes, and knew exactly what to do to remedy my problem. And I was back to comfort in 75 degree temp in the house in no time. EXCELLENT SERVICE!!👍</Review>

<Text>I cannot say enough good about KC’s.  Tina and Nicole were always spot on, supportive, helpful, full of energy, and super professional.  My technician was Isaac. He has done multiple jobs at my house and always did a great job.  This time it was a whole house job, and he did it single handedly.  He did a fantastic job, always informed me of what was happening, helped me to decide what the best option would be, never tried to up sell or force something.  Truly a professional young man, and amazingly knowledgeable.  I have used KC’s for numerous jobs and they are just simply the best.  I totally recommend giving them a call, you will not be disappointed.  5 STARS to these guys.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Great service was  provided on a weekend, with a flat rate ( no weekend service charges).  Nick, was the technician who came out to replace a broken “fridge shut off valve” for me.
I would highly recommend this Plumbing service to anyone with any plumbing issues.

Our kitchen drain started overflowing mid-day yesterday and we called several plumbing services.  KC's was the first one who could come the next morning.  Kyle arrived before his scheduled time and had the drain back to good working order within a little over 1/2 an hour.  He was professional and obviously very experienced.  Service was excellent and Kyle was very pleasant to deal with.  We'd use KC's again without question.< /Review>

Have had nothing but excellent experiences of KC's 24 1/2 Plumbing for five years!  Starting with Tina in dispatch who makes it happen to  Casey and Kyle and Jesse (techs) are prompt and attentive to the respect of my home. Whatever needs installed or repaired is done efficiently and expertly.  Thank you KC's!</review>

I want to start by saying yesterday  7/15 my water heater was leaking it was in bad shade. I was nervous trying to find a company to fix it. I came across KC’s 23 1/2 hour plumbing . From the moment I called Miss TINA !! Took care of me she told me not to worry they will come to see it the same day even after work hours and the tech and she said “ we got you Nancy “ omg!! I was so happy she made it so easy for me. I was freaking out and within a few hours a tech was at my door
The tech showed up I had so many questions he took the time to answer all of them I did compared prices and this company warranty and work is the best. EVERY PERSON FROM TINA, technicians and installer are professional and I have my brand new water heater installed today!! This company loves FAST, FAST omg it’s already installed, they called me to do a follow up and 6 years warranty and any issues they will come back and fix it
SUPER SATISFIED CUSTOMER
1) they were fast to get someone to my house
2) no hidden prices
3) services was excellent our tech person was awesome
3) they really take care of you
MY STRESS IS GONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING ALL THE REMOVAL, installation in less than 24 hours !!
I WILL RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ALL THE RESIDENTS IN THE AREA!!
I’m In Desert Hot Springs
If I could I will give this company at 10*********
For excellent service
My review is based on my own personal experience.
Thank you< /text>

I called when we had a problem with all our drains backing up and flooding the floor, KC's got someone out to our house at 8pm on a Saturday night!    Tina (dispatch) treated my emergency call with the same urgency as if it was her own plumbing problem.  Kyle, the plumber was GREAT!!  Very honest & friendly, and went above and beyond - explaining everything clearly as we decided the best course of action.
I was pleasantly surprised that the bill was reasonable, even at that late at night on a weekend!  These are now my Go-To guys, and I highly recommend KC's23-1/2 hour plumbing!< /Text>

Had multiple leaks in our water heater and they literally worked around the clock to help us out, taking multiple calls late at night on the weekend and working in 115 degree weather on a Sunday. Tina the scheduler/on call specialist was extraordinary and so kind and pleasant, while our installer Kyle was extremely knowledgeable, hard working, and great at explaining everything.

We had a problem with leak in pressure regulator valve and a clogged shower drain. Casie the plumber came out and fixed both. He fixed and saved us $400 by eliminating the expense to replace the valve by replacing the rubber casket instead also fixed the drain in the master shower by pulling a stuff out the drain 6-7 feet in the pipe. Fast, quick and very professional.</Review>

< review>
Called for first time yesterday.  Cut off valve leak (non emergency).  They answered right away, listened to my problem, and scheduled a next day visit.  Upon arrival, Jesse quoted my a fixed price which was reasonable given the amount of specialized work required.  I asked if he could do the work then, he said sure.  He then explained in detail what he would do, pipe used, the warranty, etc.  During the project (over 5 hours) he showed me his work and explained the necessary modifications.  When done, he showed me pictures (and where I could access them) and presented the final bill (as originally quoted).  Professional, informed, courteous and full clean up---they're now my "go to" plumber for all my plumbing needs.<//review>

< Review>
Highly professional technician diagnosed our problem and had a terrific new toilet working early the very next morning.  Scheduling an appointment was easy and a perfect time slot was arranged quickly. Couldn’t ask for better diligence and a commitment to getting the job done quickly. Very happy with the friendly, courteous and knowledgeable service technician. KC will be my first choice for future plumbing needs!

UPDATE:  So happy with KC’s great service that I just used them again. This time it was to replace a water pressure regulator. Came out same day I called to diagnose the issue, then had a new one —- better than the original — installed the next day. Wonderful service technician (Jesse).  Friendly office staff kept me informed all along the way. Very happy once again!< /Review>

<Review>KC's 23 1/2 hour plumbing company is the best!   I called on a Saturday and got an appointment the next day on a Sunday.   Ive made an evening appointment for extensive work to be done and it was quietly and efficiently done. Jesse gave me robust and thorough options, explaining each fully. Jesse come prepared and timely, even when I was late.  Tina on the phone always picks up and is a joy to talk with -- excellent communicators.  Highly recommend them!< /Review>< Pics>

I had two Nest Thermastats to be installed replacing two existing thermostats. Well over my head to do myself. Michael from KC’s arrived well on time and installed both, explaining what he was doing and why through the whole process. He programmed both to my phone and did not leave until I understood the basics for proper operation. I would use KC’s and Michael again without hesitation. I highly recommend both. Job well done.</review>

Then Isaac was very knowledgeable and listened to all of my issues, then he quoted pricing.  I ended up having 2 new toilets installed.  Mine were old and non-low water efficient.  He also fixed my shower head and the water pressure issue that I was having.  I am very happy with the service and quality of work.

Jesse has represented the company by explaining what is going on with our pipelines and how it can be fixed.  There were no hard selling but clear explanations.  Estimates are appropriate with no hidden fees. Work was done timely and within expectations.  🤝👍🏼< /review>< pics>

<review>I had an issue with water leaking behind a wall on a Sunday afternoon. KC’s was able to send out a tech within a couple hours to diagnose the problem for only $47 (no extra fees for Sundays). Isaac was really great, as he was both well-trained and efficient. He even checked a couple of my other toilets while he was there! I would highly recommend this company after my experience today.

Note 1: They have an airconditioning company associated with them as well.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Couldn't get our hot water tank pilot light to stay lit. Called KC's & Nicole had a tech, Kyle at our place in about an hour. Very pleased with the timing because it was late in the afternoon. Kyle assessed our needs & replaced the thermal couple all in less then 30 minutes.  I would use them again.</review>

<Review>Quick response. A plumber arrived a few hours after I telephoned. He was excellent. He diagnosed the problem quickly and had my bathroom drain opened and clear in a short time. I appreciated that he put on cloths to cover his shoes which kept my carpets clean. He also provided information about a product that will maintain and help my drains remain clear.</Review>< username>

<review>I have used KC's Plumbing for two jobs in the past two weeks--first for a major leak under the floorboard and behind a wall, and then for routine water heater maintenance.  On both occasions the plumbers were on time, courteous, friendly and professional.  KC's was competitively priced, and my problems (one of which required 7 hours' work in 112-degree heat) were corrected efficiently.  I would definitely use them in the future.< /review><rate>5</rate><user_name>Stephen Moore<//user_name><date>1533779556668</date><GmapID>0x80db1c9477e5414b:0x85a95db9c1fb0383</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Plumber showed up one hour late.  Although quoted job and completed in timely manner, charge was at least 4 times what it should have been.  When plumber found it was a real simple job the quote should have been revisited.  Not happy at all.  Name is on list of never use again.</text>

Great service. My Tankless hot water heater was not working right. They fit me in and got it fixed by the next day. It turns out the person That installed it didn’t put on flushing valves that you should have done every year. I had the tankless for 10 years lucky I guess it lasted that long. I do have a whole house filter and softener so I guess that is why it lasted. I will make this place my new first to call plumber.<//Review>

I live in Las Vegas and my real estate agent was preparing my Palm Springs home to sell when she smelled gas and suggested I contact the gas company. The gas company came out the same day and determined the leak was at the union on my side of the meter and shut off my service until I could have it repaired. My agent gave me the number to KC’s. I spoke with Nicole and she scheduled me for the next available appointment. The tech, Isaac, came out as scheduled and replaced the union ... in the rain, I might add. I was able to schedule, have repairs completed and pay for the services all from Las Vegas. I cannot express enough my thanks to KC’s 23 1/2 Hour Plumbing for their prompt and efficient services and the ease of doing it all remotely. Much appreciated and many thanks!!!<//text>

I have used KC’s Plumbing twice now. Both times I have been pleasantly surprised at the speed with which they have responded & the politeness of the customer service. Most of all I have had the same technician Luis Mandujano & he has been professional, polite, not tried to up charge the job. He explained what it could be from step to step. No surprises. Just done exactly what was needed perfectly. I will not call any other plumbing company when I have a problem.<//Text>

<review>I am very satisfied with this plumbing company there in Palm Springs..! They were on time & knowledgeable, I call them my trouble shooting EXPERTS. They were a fraction of the price of the other two plumbers that came out.. and by the way the other guys were also late and one did not even know how to fix the issue just want to charge to diagnose, what a headache... I have to tell you I will be calling KC'S as I am now one of their VIP members and I will continue to tell my friends about my experience with KC's 23 1/2 Hour Plumbing. They were terrific!

Update: 8/21/2013 - I just had them out to install a new water filtration system and I just want to say I LOVE IT! what a difference already with my first shower! I wish I had known about this years ago.<//review>< pics>

Had a backed up kitchen sink.  I called first thing in the morning and they were able to send out a technician right away.   Michael arrived and assessed the problem, made all necessary repairs and was extremely professional and courteous.   I would definitely recommend KC's for any plumbing issues.<//Text>

If I could give ZERO stars I would. They fixed a faucet and within a week it was broken: Called - they said the repair man would be out on Thursday he came on Wed and never came back. I've called and they just don't want to fix what they were paid to fix the first time. Call someone else who cares! IT's definitely NOT KC Plumbing! Not a happy customer at all!< /Review>

Called KC's after discovering we had a hot water leak UNDER our slab.  The office staff were able to schedule a quick and convient time for us.
Freddy and Isaac arrived on time and were able to pinpoint the leak in minutes.  Due to irreplaceable tile we decided to reroute the hot water line up the wall and through the ceiling and back down to the kitchen.  The job was completed in one day with very little invasive wall damage.  Isaac did an excellent job rerouting our water line and ensured that only necessary dry wall was cut to reroute the line.  Will definately use this company again should we need plumbing repairs of any kind.< /review>

I had a surprise when I went out to the garage the other afternoon. My old water heater had sprung a huge leak. I called KC's 23 1/2 hour Plumbing and within an hour Jesse arrived to remove that old leaky water heater and replace it with a new more efficient one. Thank you Jesse and KC's Plumbing. I highly recommend them for your plumbing needs.< /text>

<UserId.>116355766431660496025</UserId.><Review>Not happy at all ... I understand that they can't give estimates over the phone and all that, so one of their guys who "just happened" to be in my area was able to come by shortly after I called them on a Saturday afternoon. I wanted to get an estimate to replace the shut-off valve to my electric water heater, and I needed a diagnosis for my water heater that was leaking water from the cold water input pipe connection on top of the heater. It took about 20 minutes for the guy to give me a "total" price of $1027 to replace a 3/4 inch valve ($246 if done separately) and a 30 gal heater (with a 40 gal since the 30 gal heater costs more than a 40gal .. who knew?) Anyway, after all that I new that I wasn't going to pay that much for the job. Their $25 off plumbing service call coupon that is offered on their website wasn't accepted because I didn't have any work done, so when I went to pay the $49 Diagnostic & Trip charge with my credit card they guy said that if I paid him $20 in cash, then he would just "waive" the $49 charge to make it easier. That was nice of him. So I paid $20 to get an estimate which was so outrageous I will probably buy a heater at home depot and install it myself.<//Review><gmapID>0x80db1c9477e5414b:0x85a95db9c1fb0383</gmapID><date>1414944646386< /date>< name>

<text>Just had three part water treatment installed.  Looking forward to being happy and satisfied.

The installation has a significant leak under sink and the individual answering phones doesn't seem to be urgent to respond.  Spend over $3200 to have my kitchen flood-and get attitude.  Not pleased-hope this improves.

The service tech/installer was excellent-I know the equipment high quality-best on market. Non responsive on phone to Floods after install-be careful, nobody should pay for that.<//text>< GmapID>

They came the next day early in the morning and repaired the drainage pipe with no problem and we're very reasonably priced and great service. They were able to fix the problem in one visit and left and everything was perfect very professional I would definitely recommend them<//Review>

Isaac was the technician that installed my tankless water heater.  He was very professional both in attitude and performance.  The installation itself is layed out extremely well.  A credit to his company.  I plan to use them in the future.</review>

KC Plumbers made my day!  As the new owner of a second home in the desert, i wasn’t sure what to do when i was called and told i had a leak in my front yard. I called 6 plumbers and either got full mailboxes, no return calls or we can get to it in 3 weeks.
The incredibly cheery Tina answered the phone, took all my information, assessed the situation and scheduled my appointment for the next business day. KC arrived on time, called me with a clear description of my problem, gave me the estimate, did the work and even went around and bled all the faucets so i wouldn’t have problems when i get back out there.

This company is a treasure compared to so many others that have no idea what customer service is!< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Bravo! KC's Plumbing. It's so good to know there is a plumber out there that still cares. What an experience I had with not only the technician but with your office staff. Such personable people you have. I can't say I would of thought to of had a maintenance program on my plumbing but after learning what I did when we walked through my plumbing I realized how valuable your VIP program actually is. Long story short my little leak I had was actually a slab leak which wasn't what I was expecting. If it wasn't for the financing you offered, It would of really put me in a bad situation financially. Luckily for me you were able to have it taken care of that same day! you guys are doing things right over there. I will recommend your company as well as your VIP program to my clients, family and friends.

Thank You

<Review>Tina is the greatest!  Last month when my sewer was backing up at 3am I called, and in spite of her having the flu, she followed up throughout the night making sure everything was taken care of.  If anyone here in the Desert needs a plumber, look no more!!  KC's 23 1/2 Hour Plumbing is simply the BEST!!  Thank you so much for being there within minutes after my call!< /Review>< Name>

KC's came to give us an estimate for a new water heater the day after we called them. There was a fee, which would be credited if we had the installation. We were given a number of options, but there was no pressure or upselling. Great warranty and competitive price, and about 3 hours later, we had hot water!< /text>

<Text>When will business ever learn, to show up for an appointment? Mine was 10-12:00 kind of standard. No show no call after 12:45. Then Tina calls and says to me  "The plumber is late can you run some errands and we will see if we can get to you. What does that mean? I said forget it. I will call Kaufmann plumbings. She then said "Does that mean you want a cancel" Duh!! Horrible customer service and attitude.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Time>1532981455377< /Time><pics>None</pics><Review>KC Plumbing and the Hydroflow miracle product.
I run An American Car Wash in Palm Desert opposite Whole Foods. We had two major issues: We need spot-free water and we needed to kill all the germs in our newly installed reclaimed water system so there would be no health risk or smell. We wash 8,000-10,000 cars a month. It takes 41,000 gallons of water to do this, but we are now able to reclaim 60% of this water. The fresh water from the CVWD has lots of calcium and other minerals that will spot your car (leave your car by a sprinkler and see what happens). Left untreated, reclaim water has bacteria in it and therefore can have an unpleasant smell and potentially bad germs so we had Kelly and Casey from KC Plumbing install their Hydroflow system. Installation was fast and efficient and the product is amazing. 1) The water is now spot free, so there is no risk of water spots if a car is left to dry in the sun, which is great for our express customers. 2) No servicing is required, no adding salt, nothing… it just runs. 3) Our valves and tubes are no longer clogged with calcium or other minerals. 4) There is no more odor from our reclaim water and all the bacteria is destroyed. 5) The best part is that the payback compared to a less effective soft water system (resin and salt) is only one year. Yes it will pay itself back in one year for us and do more to boot.  I can highly recommend KC plumbing and the Hydroflow system. If it works for us it should work for anyone. I will be putting one in my home pool and we are fitting them now to our mobile car wash steam machines.<//Review><username>David Kartal<//username><gmap_id>0x80db1c9477e5414b:0x85a95db9c1fb0383<//gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< UserId.>

Great service.  The tech showed up early and went to work.  He offered different options to solve the hot water leak, explained the difference and then completed the work. Their techs know their stuff, and always leave my house clean and neat, even with messy jobs.  I have used KC's numerous times and will use them again.</Text>

We had what appeared to be a water leak out of our tank less water heater.  Jesse  arrived within a short period, diagnosed the problem as a plugged drain with our a/c, and quickly fixed the problem.  We also had a problem with the seating of one of our toilets and he did an excellent job in correcting the installation that I had done myself a few years ago.  We have been very please with the service provided by KC's 23-1/2.</Review>

<Text>I was disappointed in KC's Plumbing. I have a 97 year old Mother with a full time Caregiver. The day of the appointment, no one showed up.at the appointed time. Someone called very late in the day saying the plumber was running late and needed to reschedule for the next day. The next day, the plumber still showed up late. the Caregiver had to call to get a status report. When the plumber arrived, he reported to me via phone the complete operating insides of the toilet needed to be replaced even though the fixture was five years old. Not believable. I am in San Francisco and my Mother is in Rancho Mirage so I had to bite the bullet and agreed to the repair. I will not be using KC's Plumbing again due to poor service all the way around.

I found KC's in the Yellow Pages. On 7/13/12 I called to arrange an emergency repair. Robert Martinez from KC's Plumbing arrived to estimate the job at 9AM to repair a leaking 3/4" copper tee. I had already dug a pit to provide access to the tee for repair.

Unfortunately he wasn't able shut off the water completely to perform the repair so he would have to replace the ball valve by the meter. He also recommended installing a pressure regulator at the meter as well.

His three estimates of "about" $400 for each of the three repairs totaled $1,200 plus $59 service call. He said the "about" $400 was to protect him if the actual costs were higher. I asked him if the job actually cost less would he charge yes. His reply was "Absolutely".

I am the caretaker here for a 5 acre property in Sky Valley. The Veterinarian that owns the property was the person responsible for the bill so I introduced him to Robert so he could approved the repairs.

I arrange all contractors performing services on the property and normally supervise the entire job. In this case however, I had a prior medical appointment so I could not be there for the entire job.

Upon my return from the doctor at 12 Noon Robert was gone. I assumed he had just taken a lunch break since the pit that I dug for the repair was left open. I looked in the pit and saw that the tee valve was repaired so I assumed the ball valve and pressure regulator were installed. Strange that he wouldn't fill up the hole that I had dug for him

I then had to dig up the area around the water meter to inspect the ball valve and regulator installation. I asked the homeowner if Robert had showed him the completed work. He had not. All he did was go to the main house to get a check for the full $1,259. So much for the "Absolutely he would adjust the bill accordingly if the work cost less".

I did some research and a pressure regulator is $150 at Home Depot and a ball valve is $15, plus the copper tee and some solder so let's say $200 for parts and materials.

That leaves $1,059 charged for labor. I did some checking and even emergency weekend or after hour calls to plumbers ran $150/hr at the most. This was not the weekend nor after hours. The top hourly charge for normal calls is around $100.

I contacted KC's to complain about the charges and the owner, Mr Russum, told me that they always include a new ball valve when they install a pressure regulator and didn't know why Robert double charged. Said he must have been having a bad day. Anyway, Mr. Russum credited $400 so the bill was now $859. I asked him so why was I charge $659 labor for 3 hours work?

He said he would have Robert call me to try to straighten it out.. When he called I had him speak with the homeowner and he said, "It's like when you go in for car repairs and sign an estimate approving the charges." He got upset when we told him that was a ridiculous analogy and hung up accusing of us of recording his conversation. I should have. If I would have told him that I was going to record the call I'm sure he wouldn't have gone on an on trying to justify his outrageous repair charges.

So I was feeling generous and said OK, $3 hours at $100 per hour is $300. I contacted the owner again requested an additional discount of $300 for the excess labor charges. He said, "Now this is getting out of hand." Subsequent emails with detailed pictures of the sloppy job and the dirty work area and uncovered pit left by Mr. Martinez went unanswered.

PS To add insult to injury I had to fill the hole and clean up his mess myself. So much for their advertising claim, "Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed."<//review>< Gmap_id>

Earlier this month I called this company for a rental property I own. First of all they scheduled an appt for that same night 8:pm -10pm window. They were a no call no show. I was texted the following morning inquiring if I needed a tech still . That was my way out I should have taken. Anyway they charged me $267 for a snake and $204 to remove and reset the toilet that was already removed when they got there. They do not get authorization for work and pricing diagnosed. They do it and bill you period.  Last time I had a snake the other company Oscars Sewer & Septic only charged $135 to snake the sewer line. THEN, they, KC's 23 1/2 hour plumbing charged me for the work they did not do. My tenant had removed that toilet the night before (the unit is a 2 bath), and the company charged me for that work they did not do. I emailed them notifying them of the "error" but they never responded, nor acknowleged the correction reported of billing for work not performed. So I deducted like half ($101) of the $204 they charged me for "pulling" and resetting the toilet, paying for the resetting only, which they did do. I apprised them of payment in the mail.  I had even apprised them I would be giving them a negative review for these actions and no response.  I will never use this company again because of their exorbant prices and unethical business practices. Don't do it!!!</text>

I just paid $59 to be given a sales pitch. I called for water heater repair. I was told the service call would be $59 plus any repairs. The tech came out and did nothing. He didn't even turn one screw to automatically determine I needed a new water heater. What ensued was a 20 minute sales pitch with an option to join their "club" for another $170 or so to get a 13% discount for the next 12 months. Then he gave me the estimate...   OVER $1300 FOR A LOWBOY CONDO SIZE ELECTRIC WH.  I just recently had a complete rebuild and new water heater installed in one of my commercial buildings in Los Angeles..  The total for THAT was $1200 from Feders.  The cost of a new 40 Gallon Electric Lowboy at Lowes is only $350. You figure out where the extra $1000 goes....  I can't.   >>UPDATE<<  I found a licensed local plumber who did the whole job in 3 hours for $450 including a brand new 40 gal water heater.<//Review>

Yes, they really care.     In the worst winter ever with pipes bursting all over town on a Saturday afternoon these guys came to the house 3 times just to make sure I had water for the weekend until they could fix the problem correctly on Monday.   That's not going 1 extra mile, but 10.

And the woman on the phone is a pleasure to deal with.

I will never call anyone else.</text>

<review>They were a little behind schedule but that is to be expected as plumbing emergencies happen. When Jesse arrived he was professional and offered several solutions to my problem. He quoted them all out before deciding. He completed the work and walked me through what he did. They needed to open up a wall because I tiled over the shower without thinking. The hole was clean and I can even put the patch back in with minimal work. Will use him again for any plumbing needs for sure.</review>< Pics>
