<review>Best EXPERIENCE EVER! Teddy & Ariel made my day! Was having trouble getting my upgrade to go through. They both spent over an hour with Sprint to make sure I could get the phone I wanted. I Highly recommend this location if you want the best customer service around!< /review>< pics>

I rate this outfit ZERO (on a scale of 0 to 10) for customer service. I was there today at around 5 PM (BTW, I was the only customer in the store) for

1) unlocking an iphone that I bought from Sprint and has long been paid for;

2) activating a phone using one of the Sprint SIM cards that I never used (I had 5 lines when I first signed up the Sprint service 3 years ago but I only used 3 of the lines at that time, so there were 2 unused SIM cards in my possession)

There were three of the sales/customer support type in the store; one of them greeted me. Upon hearing what I was there for, she started saying "you should ask your new carrier to unlock the phone for you because they are making money off you;" when I asked her to activate my phone, she said we are T-Mobile not Sprint, can't activate Sprint SIM card. Then I told her, I had talked to the T-Mobile customer support rep on the phone and was advised to go to a T-Mobile store for phone activation, she said it's easy for them to offload the work on us. At this juncture, the woman sitting behind the counter chimed in, "we only do sales here, nothing else." And the guy behind the counter said, "you have to call Sprint to get help."

I left their store and went straight to the T-Mobile shop in the Westfield Mall where the lady at the counter was very helpful, she swapped my 2 Sprint SIM cards for the new T-Mobile SIM cards, activated one of my phones, helped me call T-Mobile to get my phone unlocked -- all free of charge!

Don't ever come to this store for anything 'cause you will get zip, zilch, nada, ZERO services from these no good, lazy, lowlifes (BTW, they hardly speak English); if you live in the area, go to the T-Mobile stores in Westfield Mall, and yes, there are two T-Mobile stores there.</text>

Frank was the sales person helping me. I went in because my sons previous iPad had broke and i had to send it off to Apple to get it replaced but i had left the SIM card in it so my replacement arrived with no SIM card and Frank was able to assist me. Thank you!<//Text>

<review>Very nice service.  I joined sprint 6 months ago.  The service is better than the carrier that I used before and  the price is really reasonable.      I got an iPad too,  great product and with sprint iPad service I can do a lot of things on it without finding a WiFi.   The sales rep are very nice as well.  Overall great experience. Recommend it!!!!!<//review><date>1582169145624< /date><rate>5< /rate>< Pics>

When you get to this store ask for Jerry Li. Never felt like I was being played or sold to, he explained through every detail about new plan and help out with anything you need. Jerry is knowledgeable to take care any questions with your phone bill. Best iPhone X deal and great customer services. Highly recommended to everyone!!!</text>

<Review>Came in to see about a phone for my grandfather and Jerry and his manager were extremely helpful and patient.  They made all our options clear and made recommendations based on what we needed as a family. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking to switch over or just learn more about devices currently on the market.

So... tbh this place was fine the service there was fine everything was fine except for one thing. One of the workers there told us that we could buy the phone and everything, but she didn’t mention the fact that we had to spend $200 at the store, which was kind of upsetting.(this was during an event) anyways everything else is fine.< /Review>

I have never been to a store that  prejudice, they ignores us (customers) because we were a different race. They were talking to themselves well my mother and I were staying there waiting. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there. And when they finally asked me if I need help they could help me, they didnt even try.< /Review>

Employees at the store are friendly and helpful. This rating is for Sprint. 4 things you should know before signing up with Sprint.
1) you can’t talk on the phone and use the internet at the same time
2) each time you move your sim card to another phone you have to let Sprint know otherwise it won’t work. When you move it back you have to let them know
3) they don’t support digital sim for iPhone so the dual sim feature on the iPhone is not useable
4) call quality is noticeably worse than Verizon and Tmobile</Text>

(Translated by Google) The staff was very enthusiastic and answered all my questions. Although I failed to handle it for my own reasons, several friends have been recommended to do so. This line must be selected for the sprint line. I have also visited several places nearby, but others have a very general attitude and highly recommend this one.

(Original)
员工很热情，回答了我所有的问题，虽然最后因为我个人的原因没有成功办理，但是已经推荐了好几个朋友来办理了。开sprint的线路 一定要选这家，附近也去过好几家咨询过，但是其他家态度真的很一般，强烈推荐这家。< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The sales staff is very patient. Strongly recommend john jiang service to mind people nice key to answer. It’s not like a business that doesn’t ask for a deal!! It’s really cheaper to catch up with the promotion. And the personal use of the signal is surprisingly good, the network speed is also fast. It’s really convenient for me to watch football live broadcasts!

(Original)
銷售人員非常耐心。強力推薦john jiang 服務用心人nice關鍵有問必答。不像別的商家一筆交易做完就不理不問了!!趕上promotion的時候真的便宜優惠很多。而且個人使用下來信號出奇得好網速也快。對於我這種喜歡看足球直播的來說真的很方便!。<//Review>

(Translated by Google) They are the sprints of the Chinese community chain, deceiving a lot of people, and there are also a large number of victims in the Los Angeles Chinese network. Even if you want to open a sprint, you should go somewhere else.

(Original)
他们是华人区连锁的sprint，骗了很多人，洛杉矶华人网也有大量受害者倾诉。即使你想开sprint，也应该去其他地方。</review>

(Translated by Google) Chinese compatriots don't want to be deceived. All mobile phones are not free. The monthly fee doubles after one year, the signal is poor, the network is slow, and finally you know that you have to cancel the change of the station to reveal a sinister face. You need to find the person who received you at the beginning~ Will tell you that she has been fired!!!

(Original)
中国同胞不要去受骗,所有手机都不是免费，月费一年后升一倍，信号差，网络慢，最后知道你要取消换台就露出险恶的嘴脸，你要找当初接待你的人～就会告诉你已经她被解雇了!!!<//Review>

Lovely place. Sometimes they are out of ingredients for certain drinks but considering how nice the employees are and how fast they work, I can't take a whole star off. I come here on a regular basis and was never disappointed.< /Review>

Welcoming and friendly baristas, clean store, and amazing location, directly next door to a Cold Stone Creamery store!! Basically every store you  could want in one location.🍦🎂 Groceries...you got it. Banks with ATM's...they have that too! But the Starbucks, you'll be glad you tried this location! Who could possibly want more than great coffee, frappuccinos and lattes served by really nice people with a smile!!!😀< /text>

I like this Starbucks. It’s always a nice place to go to. Today’s visit was a little different. I’m not a fan of wearing face masks but I do so because of family and other people’s health. Today this Starbucks was serving customers with out face masks. I even saw customers walk in with a face mask,make the order and then take them off while waiting for their orders inside. Of course no wanted to say anything because they’re afraid of confrontation. Like always I was pleased with my coffee and croissant.</Text>

Good coffee, good service. The mobile app makes it easy to order. They get pretty busy here. I wouldn’t say it was anything out of ordinary Starbucks. Overall I enjoyed my drink and will be back.< /Review>

The coffee was good as always. Very disappointed they still are not allowing inside dining. They probably don't have control of the outside courtyard, but there were only 2 tables or so outside and they were filthy dirty, trash can was overflowing and the ground was filled with spilled drinks and trash. Won't go there again until they up their game a bit.< /review>

Great hot chocolate and even better coffee and snacks. You can even buy your own personal coffee mug and all that at Starbucks! It has a great atmosphere you always feel welcomed and cared about in here and the mood is always happy no matter what time of day you come in there.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><text>This particular Starbucks is great. The line can be long but it's never a long wait. The Baristas are quick and the drinks are accurate. The lobby is not nearly spacious as it needs to be, however the hustle and bustle of this Starbucks in the mornings gives it a real Seattle coffee shop feel. There is a lot of great  outdoor seating in the shade and the bathrooms are clean.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Pros:
- Excellent staff. They are always friendly and helpful.
- The place is always clean and there is plenty of room to sit, work, or study.

Cons:
- This has to be BY FAR the SLOWEST starbucks I've ever been to. Not sure if it's just the location, but most of the time I've come here the line is out the door so I just turn around and leave. I'd pass on this Starbucks if you are in a hurry. This is the main reason for the 3 stars.
- The store is located in an awkward place, sort of wedged back in a corner away from the main parking stalls.<//Review>

Ok for coffee but they seem to be pressed too hard for production speed and are getting sloppy on quality execution.  Many drinks made differently than recipe (you guys came up with these names, please train your staff on them...latte macchiato, espresso macchiato, and Carmel macchiato are different drinks!!!) and specifics often overlooked...like number of shots...easy to tell in iced drinks.

Sigh.....<//text>

I've been to many Starbucks in the state. They have great service and got my frap in 2mins right when I ordered it. Even when it was busy, they have fast WiFi as well.</Text>

<review>Of all the car places I went to, these people are the best hands down! They work with you, and make sure you get into the car you want/need. They’re so welcoming & so professional. I’ve been to few places in Visalia, and Visalia people were RUDE & don’t work with your budget as well. But I’ve seen firsthand, how many people didn’t walk away from a car in Visalia, and going to Bakersfield they have! I recommend going here!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I honestly hardly ever write reviews but i felt that the guys at standard went the extra mile for me. From david helping with the buying of the car to the mechanics that fixed the light and window on my lexus. Ive bought cars from numerous dealerships and none match the customer service or how friendly these guys are.<//Review>< pictures>

They sell cars with problems and you take it back before 30 days and say there's no problems. Then after the 30 days they try to become rude about the same problem that occurred prior to the 30 day warranty and get rude with you.< /Review>

<Text>Sold my son a lemon car, now giving him the run around.The shop says it needs a new motor after paying $11,000.00 he drove it for 3 days and they won't even give him a loaner car, they knew the car was bad and sold it anyway so that it would be fixed by insurance wouldn't recommend this place.<//Text>< userid>

<text>I spoke with the owner who returned my text right away and told me to talk to Rafael the next morning.  Rafael greeted my daughter and I in a nice friendly manner.  Showed us the vehicle that I had asked about., a VW bug in excellent condition.   Didn't try to bait and switch.  Let us test drive and once we made decision he graciously followed us home to let me drop off my truck and brought us back so I could drive the VW home (daughter in training).   Ruby in the office was very friendly, super efficient
and we were out in no time.  Easiest car buying experience.  Also would like to thank the owner of Durango Auto next door for washing car and fixing key fob.  Nice selection (I wanted the Jeeps!), had exactly what my daughter calls her dream car.< /text>< Pics>

Terrible. Super shade service, with very very shady staff. Cars are super overpriced for something that's borderline breaking down. These people don't care about satisfaction as much as they care about taking your money.< /review>

<Time>1621291756573</Time><Review>I ordered two rolls for take out. The flavor was fine and tasty, but an often under appreciated aspect of sushi is the rice. It's taken for granted, but it's integral to the success of a good roll. Maybe it was an off day, but the rice was just a tad too pebbly. It was not a bad experience. I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.<//Review>< response>

Nice little place with calm atmosphere. Service was good and attentive.
Food is very good, yet portions may be a bit on the small-side for some, but well worth the price.< /text>

<text>Sashimi is an excellent sushi bar. Fish is very fresh. Sauces are amazing. They have over 70 cut rolls. The Sweet Shrimp-Aemebi is incredible. Peter and Susan treat you so well.

<Text>Their food is fantastic but I did a takeout order.  They missed my roll and gave veggie tempura instead of shrimp and veggie.  I asked before I left and they insisted it was my mistake.  I called and asked why I paid $50 for 2 rolls, miso soup and veggie tempura and they insisted that I was wrong and I got & paid for what I ordered.

I paid $50 for my husband to have dinner and me to have vegetables and soup.

I don’t know that we will ever go back and we had been going to old location for years.<//Text><rate>2<//rate><gmapID>0x80dcea3ac00589b1:0xe0aff5aea67a962c<//gmapID>< user_id>

I visit this outstanding place every couple of days since I like the good air that is part of this place. The team is very helpful and skilfull. The service is deeply rapid. Most important, the food you eat is first-rate. I visited often and I was never disappointed. The cost is fair. I highly recommend this restaurant to to everybody.</Review>

Love this place! They've doubled down on outdoor seating recently. Always a line around the corner on weekends, but quick turnover. So many choices of sausages. Fries and sauces are always a must. The Sour beer is my fav.</review>

Get the sea urchin udon. The noodles are freshly made in front and the creamy goodness makes me want to come back again and again. There's dozens of other types of udon too but I always crave the sea urchin one.< /review>

We just had a first time wonderful dinner here at Sashimi. Very high quality sushi. Huge menu with a great variety of rolls to choose from. I cannot eat sushi rolls with rice, and their are so many options here. My husband and I had 3 rolls between us and both of us are well satisfied. The service is excellent. We will definitely be back.<//Review>

<text>Leaving this from my wife’s phone. We went there tonight and were pleasantly surprised. Warm welcome, super friendly staff, food was high quality delivered with sincerity. 100 percent authentic...they want u to have a good experience.  Probably some of the best sushi we’ve ever had.

I loved going to this restraint when it was at its previous location. This was the first, and will be my last, to visit the new location. I did walk in at what appeared to be a busy time (about 12:50 pm) and my order was taken rather quickly. One sushi roll should have not taken 40 minutes. Yup, I finally walked out after 40 minutes of waiting and still ‘NO FOOD.’ They had two sushi chefs working who seemed to be filling many call in/take-out orders and catering well to the drunk lunchtime clientele. Maybe they gave one of them my order by mistake. It was only one item and I kept justifying the reason why it was taking so long. But, one server could not be the reason. However, in that 40 minute time frame she did not come to see how I was once. I’ve never felt more invisible in a restraint then today.</Text>

<review>So friendly and tasty! While I wish I could afford sushi every night,  and the place isn't over priced,  I will unfortunately only be going here every other week instead of every day. Loved  the hana roll especially.  Looking forward to tying more on their menu!<//review>< UserId.>

<Name>Brian Valenti<//Name><Date>1564198662856</Date><Rate>2< /Rate><review>The waiter we had was just the worst. He would repeatedly ignore us for over 20 minutes at a time and was generally rude. Google says we were there for 1 hour and 40 minutes to get 4 rolls, sake, and sashimi for 2 people.

I know it was a Friday night, but for $90 a person ($172 total), he could at least acknowledge we existed.

The support staff was fantastic (I doubt we would have eaten without them) and I guess the food was good, but the waiter seriously ruined it for us.

We will never be back, which is a pity because I was really looking forward to coming here.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Oh I just love Sashimi. Peter and Susan really go the extra mile to make you feel like family, and their food is delectable. The uni is always super fresh and all of Peter's creations are really amazing. You can't go wrong with any of the selections here. I won't go anywhere else for quality sushi.< /Text>< Pics>

This is a new restaurant that took over the old Baja Fresh. The restaurant is a nice little family run place with tables and sushi bar. Sadly, the new restaurant cannot get away from the sewer gas smell that comes out of the drains - and has for years. I don't know how they can solve a design flaw...
Friday night was busy! The staff was doing their best, but was overwhelmed. They smiled and served you and scurried away to the next issue.... They really need to assign responsibilities for each person.
Overall, this fish was ok, the service was acceptable given the newness of the restaurant. Would we go again? Yes, on a night that isnt so busy, like a Thursday night.<//text>

Very friendly, great staff, and great quality food! The sushi is on the pricey side, but it's worth it! If it's the first time you go and eat, they will give you a card where you mark down how many times you eat there and on the 5th time you go, you get 10% off and on the 10th time you get 20% off. Will definitely come again!</Review>

<Review>Great customer service. Ordinary experience.

Took a drive over to Sashimi for Friday night dinner as it is located close to the RSM area. The main thing that stood out for me as the excellent customer service. Our waiter was prompt and seemed genuinely happy to wait on us. Pricing was acceptable and service was prompt. Unfortunatley the quality of the food and general atmosphere of the establishment was ordinary. If you are looking for a quick bite and to watch some TV on one of the large screen TVs they have then this would be a great place but if you are looking for an upscale sushi establishment possibly for a date night then you may want to pass.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The sushi was the freshest we have had in a long time for a price that was much lower than we thought possible and the service was great!  I highly recommend going to Sashimi!<//review>

Nice facility for a storage facility. A bit challenging to get your items inside the comfort controlled storage area as the door doesn't stay open and it's somewhat narrow going in.< /text>

friendly staff. beware of extra fees like $25 admin fee, $18 lock and $13 monthly insurance . i was not aware of these until i was in their office going through the forms! i did buy my own lock elsewhere, similar to theirs for half the price :)< /review>

Storage unit was clean and air conditioned. Entry was easy through the security system and I felt very relaxed knowing my property was in a safe and clean place. Would use the facility again if required.

Staff very friendly and helpful.<//Review>

Cannot express enough appreciation for helpful the staff were during the year my motor home was there. They opened it up to save my fridge in the spring, they sent me pictures in the fall when I was coming down so I could see the condition of it. When the world returns to normal and I can come back, I most certainly will< /review>

Customer service over the phone is HORRIBLE!!! The gentlemen who answers is great, however.... The hispanic gal is rude.  She's cut me off mid sentence and has a very stand-offish attitude.  Talk about a chip on her shoulder.  Maybe it would be different if I was white.< /text>

This place will charge fees for people in the hospital with COVID, give you attitude on the phone and not offer to work with you to receive payment, and threaten to take your things even if you're sick fighting for your life. DO NOT RENT HERE. After having to care for a family member and dealing with this place for them, they are NOT worth your time!</Review>

<response>None<//response><text>This is my first time using Desert Storage for my Class B RV.  Since I am from out of state, I called them several times for information/pricing etc and they were so helpful.  My covered space was so easy to drive into and the staff so very nice.  I plan to leave my RV there for several months.;  Updated 5/2020, My time having my RV in storage was up (time to head back to Seattle)and everyone at Desert Storage was so pleasant.  I was impressed that they called me the next day after I had headed out with my rv, to make sure I had left (it wasn't stolen).  I appreciated their follow-up and concern.  I would store my rv there again!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

<text>We can only say good things about how we were treated by the staff at Desert Storage.  Patty and Bill were fantastic.  Told us about all the ins and out of parking our RV there.  Great place, very clean and you can tell the property is kept up.  Also great to receive a 10% discount and if you pay a year in advance you get the 13th month free.  We are sure we are going to be very glad we picked Desert Storage for our RV parking.     Jim & Karen</text>< Pics>

Very straight forward and courteous, facility looked secure and fit my needs perfectly. Patty was very good explaining all that was needed and Bill was most helpful showing me around to ensure my vehicle was safe while stored there.<//Text>

<review>Great staff and a very friendly atmosphere!! The new iron rod fencing they put up is amazing! They even found me a special that would save me the most money possible, but they have plenty to choose from. I appreciate that they took their time to give me a golf car tour and elaborate on all their amenities available. Couldn't have chosen a better place to store my belongings! Thank you Desert Storage and RV Staff!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I've been using this location to park my 30ft Class C on and off for the last 4 years. I have been extremely pleased with the price and the location. It's now under new ownership and management. Its a very professionally run business. I just entered in again Aug 2015. The gentleman at the desk was extremely friendly and open, he even let me go and select my location to park. I would definitely recommend storing your RV here for a place to park and keep it safe. For the price it's well worth it!</Text>< pictures>

We got excellent customer service the day we went in to desert storage and rv.  The temperature was 117 thy day and the gentlemen still took us out to see dofferent units regardless of the heat.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a place to store your valuables.  Very clean and safe<//Text>

I have been with them nearly 1 year. When Renny, Maggie, and Javier were there, customer service was great! Now that they are gone, customer service has declined tremendously. I was not contacted as promised when reconstruction started, was spoken to rudely by Bill after being attacked by red ants, and was hung up on by Lety. What a rude bytch! Needless to say, when they cut costs by bringing in these new folks, they also cut good communication skills, customer service, and raised prices. I'm outta there today! Oh by the way, the so-called manager Patty is even worse! Besides also being a rude bytch, she continued to make excuse after excuse to why they can't do their job properly. I had to remind her that their new found incompetence and unprofessionalism will cause the customers to CLOSE THEIR DOORS for them. Thank God I'm no longer a customer!</review>

< Review>
Sad to be disappointed. Got pan fried shrimp and glass noodle salad vegetarian style at this place. While the shrimp was quite alright, the noodle salad... how do I put it... wasn’t according to the recipe. Maybe the noodles were stored together with chicken, I don’t know, they tasted weird like as if they had fish sauce in them. Blandly boiled veggies and somewhat withered lettuce accompanied the weird tasting noodles. I make that salad at home, so I know it gotta taste and look completely different. Had to toss the whole plate minus some cashews from the top.<//Review>

<Text>Quality of the food is spotty. Some things are excellent while others are terrible. We got Bangkok City Chicken and it was inedible. Didn't realize it till we had already brought it all home. It was dry, like jerky. It clearly had been cooked before the day we got it and then somewhat reheated and given to us. I would have rather just contacted them via email and let them know that, but there is no email address on their website. From reading other reviews, I felt calling in and making my concern known would not have resulted in a positive outcome.<//Text><gmapID>0x809b712d57be9c3f:0x97455465f8aba0cc</gmapID>< rating>

Worst service ever. All around terrible experience ordering from here. The lady at the front was very rude and did not seem to want our service.

Was my first time ordering from here and will be my last. My full review about our experience on yelp.< /text>

<review>Extremely disappointing. The fresh rolls consisted of spring mix, carrot and tofu. The Chandara Thai menu lists them as having alfalfa sprout, mint and cilantro. None of the six we ordered had these ingredients. These are common ingredients in fresh rolls at every Thai restaurant I have ever visited.

We also ordered the Pad Kee Mao. It was one of the few items on the menu that was free of animal sourced ingredients. However, it tasted suspiciously of chicken.

I will not be returning. If you want good Thai food  Panoy Bistro, Taste of Thai and Sopa Thai are a far better choice.</review>< Pics>

<text>First time eating at this establishment. Very nice decor and abiance. Servers were very friendly. I would have given them 4 stars, however, I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, which was great and would have been better if the tails had been removed from the shrimp. I do not understand cooks who do not remove the tails from shrimp when cooked in dishes. If it were prawns or shrimp cocktail it would be acceptable, but it's not acceptable when cooked in a dish. I will go back though.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We really like this place. It was very nice inside kind of upscale but quiet environment. I like the way their menu was laid out, prices were reasonable, and most importantly the food was excellent!

A major consideration for us as well is location. Much easier to park and get in and out of than the Thai places in downtown Grass Valley and Nevada City.

We will absolutely be returning in the near future.< /review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>I have never revised a review of a place, but I am now. I hate to say it but Chandara has been slowly going downhill. Below average phad thai and rard nah,  confusion as to which dish had which meat or was suppose to be just vegetables. Plus the spice levels have now become very hit or miss.  This used to be good, but not so much anymore these last few months.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809b712d57be9c3f:0x97455465f8aba0cc<//gmap_id></record>

<text>Excellent Thai food. Take out order was hot and ready in 15 mins. Incredibly fresh and home made. Great Thai flavors. Tofu seemed home made as well. Super yum! Give this place a shot!< /text><gmap_id>0x809b712d57be9c3f:0x97455465f8aba0cc</gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

<review>Extremely disappointing experience. My family has spoken highly of their food.

Walked in 35-40 minutes before they closed at 3pm on Father's day. Not an extremely long time before they close, but long enough we won't take up too much time if a little later than 3 exactly. I was seated directly next to the door and the rest of the party came in shortly after me (4 total). Took multiple minutes to receive a menu and spent a couple looking over the large variety of option.  After 5 plus minutes in restaurant, last 2 of party return from restroom and server comes and asks if we are ready to order. In the middle of ordering appetizers, the server makes it clear we have to eat our order and leave by 3pm and cannot stay any later to finish up our lunch. Given that this was over 30 minutes before their posted close time, and the server waited until we had been seat and picked our food, and only then decided to tell us we have to rush our lunch and be out of there by 3. If we had been politely told they are trying to close at exactly 3 and at least been greeted with a smile and courtesy that would have been accepted. But with the rude and inconsiderate manner in which we were treated, I guess I'll never know how good their food might have been.</review></record>

We tried this establishment because we very much enjoy That food. I ordered everything mild. It came a little spicier than I would have liked but not bad.  My guests and I had burning #2  trips to the bathroom for days! Were we poisoned or just bad food ?? ,Never again!< /Review>

Water was gross tasted like rusty pipes. I order the green curry you could taste the nasty water in it. No one in my party enjoyed there food. Do not eat here. I've eaten thai food all around the world. This was by far one of the worst.</Text>

<Review>Always spicey at Chandara! Got met with a little apprehension walking thru the door with 9 people and no reservations but as dinner got underway our presence was more warmly welcomed.
No "birthday desserts" we were told. Ordered fried banana with Coconut ice cream, not bad :)
Order light as entre portions are large, and spices are Thai spicey not American.
Ordered drunken noodles last time, spicey. They were almost to much... almost.
Father in-law got regular and said they were HOT! Very quiet the 3 times I have been here and there always seems to be a good bit of room for seating. Relatively new restaurant in town (September 2018) still seems to be finding its footing but the food is VERY solid and I will be back.</Review>< UserId.>

This was not only the worst thai food I have ever had,  it was the worst food I have ever ordered from a restaurant in my entire life. My food was over salted to the point of being inedible and had none of the characteristics of the very common Thai dish I ordered other than it contained beef. The water was also very bad. It was either very heavily chlorinated or both of the glasses at my table had large amounts of dish detergent residue. I recommend drinking beer instead,  as it will come in a bottle and remove Chandara from the entire equation. You will also appreciate the alcohol as your outing at this awful restaurant continues.

My server wasn't nearly as terrible as my food was, but how the restaurant responded when I sent my food back was awkward, unprofessional, rude and brief.

In short, I cannot recommend Chandara in any way. It wasn't just bad Thai food like panda express is bad Chinese food, it was bad food in general. Chandara should immediately clean house and get new cooks, and possibly a new dishwasher.

-edit-
I thought I should mention that I have never posted a review on Google before, but my experience at Chandara was so terrible I decided I should warn everybody. Nobody deserves 5 top ramen flavor packets masquerading as thai food.<//text>

<review>Omg, as someone from Brooklyn, I have to stan this place and give my stamp of approval. The sauce, the crust, the mozzarella cheese, even the pepperoni they use. By far, this is one of the best pizza places (just about the best actually) I have had in California since I came here. It literally had me giggling and reliving my childhood years in Brooklyn while eating it. Yes, it's that good. I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed.< /review>< Pics>

We get pizza almost every Friday from Rock on. We love it! But this last Friday they were super stars! There was a mixup with our order...we got 2 pizzas, but both came with pepperoni. Our daughter is vegetarian. We called Rock On Pizza and they brought a new CHEESE pizza, on a Friday night, in under 30 mins!! Thank you so much Rock on! Your NYC pizza is the best!</text>

<Review>I am 100% satisfied customer here! This pasta place was awesome. They never fail me on my high expectations. They strive to provide us the best service that exceeds our expectations. Highly recommended for both meetings and friends as well for having an excellent atmosphere.

This spot is the one I like best. I visit plenty of restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very welcoming and the cooking they place on your table is so flavorful. I never decline to have a good meal here. Highly recommended.</text>

I left there 7 mi delivery zone. Reaches rancho Bernardo and most all places in Escondido. Definitely New York style thin crust, which scares toppings but very enjoyable. You most likely need to order two large pizzas to feed a group of six people.</Review>

<Text>This place is absolutely amazing.  Pizza quality.  Service quality (read: willingness to deal with my weird-ass topping orders).  Delivery experience (they know and greet my cats at the door - yeah, maybe I order pizza too much - you got a problem with that?).  Dine-in atmosphere (cool, relaxed, personable, rock n roll theme).  I'm so in love with these people and their pies!< /Text>< pics>

Outstanding spot for tasty pizza. Great place to relax, people watch, eat good food or all the above.  I will be back with my relatives. Prices were fair for the quality of the food. Feels similar to a restaurant in New York I loved.</review>

VERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRY SLOW.
20 minutes became  OVER 45 minutes, it's much better to go to Italy and get my pizza than waiting all that time.
I don't know what they are doing, jumping from place to place without product any pizza !!!!< /Text>

Picked up six huge pizzas for my crew... They loved them. Very delicious and fresh.

Great deals on FB and Yelp! Coupons are on the boxes as well.

Easy to get to right off the freeway.

Parking can be a little tricky as this strip mall is tiny and has limited spots especially during lunch hours.

If you're craving pizza and are in the Escondido Area, this place is the spit to visit.< /Review>

Italian sandwich was just okay. Not sure why the style of the sandwich was the way it was, with meat folded outwards instead of laying within the bread, making it pretty difficult to eat and taking a bite causing most of the sandwich to fall out without basically rebuilding the thing.</Text>

<text>Website says they Deliver in a 7 mile radius but that is incorrect. I tried to order delivery and they said they only deliver within 7 miles. The website even has a picture of a 7 mile radius circle around in their store and we are well within that circle (attached). I understand you make pizza for a living but learn what radius means. POOR MANAGEMENT & FALSE ADVERTISING.<//text>< Pics>

this place gets better all the time.  the service -- we usually have it delivered -- is friendly and quick, the pizza is terrific.  i usually create my own and they take my order with a smile and deliver, glitch-free.  so glad they're in our 'hood, not many GOOD places deliver in the hodges area.<//Review>

He treated me and my girlfriend like we were friends. Chatted about rock and artists while the pizza was getting ready. Overall great place.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf3fd7507df55:0xb315f967b2501cc4<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>The location is good and the opera was fun.  Plenty of parking, that said though - Stan State needs to change the language of their parking ticket.  Charge me six bucks to park for a few hours sucks, but it's fine. Lying to me and saying that it is a two day pass, but it expires at 11:59pm the date of purchase irritates me. Don't believe me, see the picture.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I came here to watch a play. I am also CSUS alumni & graduated at this amphitheater. This place is very spacious, clean and events here are well organized. You will be in the grass, so stay away from heels. Bring a blanket if you are watching a play.</text>

It is fun watching a show under the stars. The sound can echo though so it makes it hard to hear at times. Bring a chair, blanket and some bug spray and have a great time.<//review>

This was a terrible place to have graduation.  NO SHADE WHATSOEVER!  Man!  We had it pretty good, too, as it was an unusually cooler day.  But when the sun poked out from the clouds - it was HOT!  I don't know how families suffer through this each year?
THIS AMPHITHEATER NEEDS SHADE!!
I'll bet many go home with such terrible sun burn.  OUCH!
AND this graduation went on an hour longer than was told the students.  Lots of families had reservations and was getting pretty antsy about leaving to make it to their reservations.  Talks WAY tooo long and one especially VERY inappropriate talk.  WRONG platform.  Wheather you agreed or not, this was not the place for that talk.  WRONG WRONG WRONG.  Don't do it again!</Review>

<review>The food is good. It's pretty straight forward. Nice hole in the wall, small business. You get a lot of food, for the price you pay. I paid $7.90, for a 2 combo plus a drink. Good for a quick bite. It's easy to pass by, from the main road.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I came here one sunday morning because it was near where i was going. Ok enough of the small talk. Its good! I now come here almost every Sunday. The portions are BIG...HUGE! Could not believe it. Panda Express comes no where near the portions they serve here. The lady in front is very kind (pretty too :))
Anyways... Beauty talk aside. I like this place!!<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< user_id>

I like cone here for Chinese food, the place is clean and the service is always great, they have a little bit of everything, and when you buy a single serve for your self, the bowl is enough for one person, you can choose between rice or noodles or both on the same bowl. And is inexpensive. 👍</Text>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this great place. I am glad to say that we had a phenomenal evening and the place was indeed the reason for the strong gathering. The crew  collaborated in a pleasant way, the cuisine was delicious and my guests were so  delighted. We shall definitely return for more events. thanks very much.</text>

Service was fast and friendly and it is reasonably priced.  I ordered a chili verde burrito with eggs and beans, gosh it was very good. My friend ordered the chili verde plate with rice and beans.
I will definitely stop here again very soon.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Easy to get to from 1-5. The shrimp tacos were tasty. Every ingredient fresh. Nice to find an independent doing a great job in a small (might I say miniscule) town off the beaten track. $15 lunch for 2.<//Review><user_name>Annette MacKay</user_name>< Pics>

Would be 5 stars if they gave good portions kinda really bummed on the amount of food for the price $9 for rice beans and a super small portion of cut steak with mostly tomato and onions good food but probably won't be going back unless they have better portion sizes</Review>

It’s worth your time to get away from the fast food chains along the busy I-5. I had the Chili Rellenos, they were excellent! I ordered too much, so I took the leftovers to go, for lunch the next day.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) Food always Delicious AND always fresh. The tasty net broth with fresh vegetables. But what I like the most is their chicken enchiladas with red sauce.

Curbside pickup still has issues:

Went to spot #2 to pick up my order and was approached by staff informing me the spicy nuggets were out of stock and that they were out of 1/4 patties. Staff initially tried to get me to cancel my order, but I asked if substitutions were possible. My order of the Travis Scott burger came with 2 mini patties and my substitutions of regular nuggets for spicy nuggets came with spicy nuggets in the end.

After an 8minute wait, despite me being parked in the #2 spot, another associate brought my order to a car not in the #2 spot and declared the order he was carrying was for #2 while delivering to the wrong car.< /Text>

This location is really hit or miss, I never know if it will be a good batch or bad batch of fries, if the burgers will be cold. Have received great service, but have also had bad attitudes from management at times.</review>

McDonald’s have kicked up their locations and I am fortunate to have this one in my town. They are extremely clean. The employees are just nice n polite , I only order special healthy stuff as much as possible ( no cheese  and no sauce , etc) . But love the sugar free iced coffee for 2.00 versus Starbucks at 3.75 +. Always good and u can ask for creme  on the side to watch the calorie intake.
I am amazed how nice they are. It’s a great place to drive thru .</text>

The fries were hot. I love hot fries. I wish you would have Coke Zero. I never get a drink, because I'm addicted to Come Zero only. The employees were very nice and both smiled.</Text>

Honestly, over the years i've now converted from loving In-N-Out fries to McDonald's fries. But you have to eat them while they're hot. My only complaint is that this McDonald's can be difficult making a left into and making a left out of on the woodruff side. Very friendly staff. The cashier today did forget to ask what sauce I wanted for the happy meal nuggets, so they defaulted to BBQ. They could've asked upon handing us our order. But I also forgot to state what sauce I wanted....not used to eating at fast food often and ordering something that comes with a choice of sauce.< /review>

The girl at the window was great. She was very nice and was trying to help because they didn't have the right order ready for me. The manager, named Miriam, came up and asked for a receipt, I gave it to her. Then she question the time of the purchase and was very rude. We were in line for a long time, the line was to the street. So while we were on the street one of the employees took our order on a tablet. None of that really matters. But when you ask me to produce a receipt that I just received minutes ago, and then you treat me rudely because of your lack of professionalism or managerial skills because of your inability to have manners. That's where I have an issue. Also I asked her to check if there was sweet and sour sauce for my daughter's Happy meal, she had said yes and pretended to look.  So we leave, then a block down from McDonald's my daughter informs me that there wasn't any sauce for her nuggets. So we drove up and informed Miriam that she had lied and she rolled her eyes and displayed more of that winning managerial skills. Don't go to this McDonald's there are plenty of better ones in the area that will treat you with respect and actually care about giving your order correct with better customer service. Avoid Miriam she is a miserable person who must need to find a non customer service line of work.< /Text>

<Review>This location is better than most locations. I visit here because they may take a tad bit longer in preparing your order, but I haven't had a wrong order in quite a long time. The accuracy goes a long way. They have a cool hall of fame for local high schools and there are some notable names on there. Would rate better if the service was faster, but all in all this is the best location in the area.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd32790dff14c1:0x9182ff5de8ed8e6e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Unfortunately this is the closest McDonald's to our house.  This place is horrible.  Every time I come here there's always something wrong with my order.  From missing food, cold fries, to bringing home someone's order!!  Lines are long and the wait is horrible.  Staff are not friendly at all.<//Review><user>108640158527120032948<//user><name>GeGe J.</name>< resp>

This McDonald's is a disgrace to this iconic name! The Managers and workers are clueless/rude. I understand everyone needs a job, but please......hire people that want to work and are competent. NOT ALL GHETTO!!!! I get tired of hearing that the ice cream machine is broken. It's the middle of August and very HOT, people want ice cream. How hard is it to fix your machine or to buy one that works! You make enough money. I can go to any other McDonald's out side of Lakewood and their ice cream machines are working just fine. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FRANCHISE!!!!!!! I had to give this review a star, if not....my review wouldn't post.</text>

< Review>
Tried their western bacon cheese burger... taste decent but size is definitely a lot smaller than photos and on tv. Not worth $5.50! I'm sticking with their bacon double cheese burger for $2.00 next time. I also like their cold brew ice blended coffee w whip cream and caramel and chocolate syrup</Review>

<Text>I visited this location in the late evening and had the worst possible experience. I ordered and paid on the kiosk at exactly 6:15pm. After waiting 15 minutes later I said enough is enough. This is supposed to be a "fast food" restaurant! I walk over to the counter and ask the so called
"manager" to check on my order since it had been 15 minutes since I ordered. She said nothing and walked away with my receipt as I looked at her check her monitor where the orders transmit I heard her say "we don't have your order". She then proceeded to get my order together 5 minutes later she sends another employee to give me my order. I asked the employee to call the manager over so I can speak to her and I can hear her tell him"I'm busy right now". He then proceeded to ask what I believe was a "supervisor" if she  could go over and speak to me since the "manager "didn't want to do it. When she came over I asked what had happened with the delay of my order and she told me that there was probably other complicated orders that they were working on and they didn't "purposely ignore" my order. So I told her that was not the case because the manager clearly stated she didn't have my order on her monitor and never once did I say that they "purposely ignored" my order. I told her that if there was an issue with the kiosk not transmitting the order they should have the issue fixed to not be an inconvenience to others as it was for myself. She offered no apology for the 20 minutes waited to receive my order. This establishment is lacking leadership and needs new management that are willimg to take accountability for mistake and not make excuses and saying "we didn't choose to ignore you". As a customer you should never hear that form a so called supervisor. Completely unprofessional and uncalled for avoid this location!<//Text>< Pics>

A good McDonald's. They give back to the community by being a sponsor to community events and donating to worthy causes. Plus the food is always delicious. Minus one star because if you don't ask for ketchup and you order fries it won't be in the bag.<//Review>

McDonald's prices have gotten to the point where you can hardly afford to go out to eat anymore. Five bucks for a quarter pounder almost five bucks for a Big Mac. I know the old days are gone but I miss them. If it weren't for the 2 for $4 breakfast sandwiches I would probably not go there anymore.<//Review>

This is the freaking worst McDonald's ever ! I live two blocks away and go there out of convenience, NO MORE!

The people there simple can't freaking count or ever give you the right stuff that you paid for. Surprisingly you are always given less not more! Coincidence? I don't know. Maybe a subtle way to maximize profits?

In my latest incident half hour ago, not only did it take me 45 minutes to go through the drive through, so much for fast food!

Like always, was shorted a 10 pic chicken nugget box, it pisses me off! So what is one expected to do? go get in line again, get in in argument with an incompetent manager or employee about the order.

Enough is enough, I'd rather crawl to ANY other McDonald's but not here, NO MORE. It there was a zero star rating , they would get that or less.< /Text>

What is great is there is a gas station connected to the restaurant which gives you gas, snacks, and a meal option all in one. Drive though is inclusive and always a pleasure. The line is no more than a 4 minute wait even with four cars waiting.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Great McD's. Even when busy, always fast service. Workers are friendly and competent. Food is always prepared correctly and taste great.</review>

The menu boards suck. They switch screens too fast and have the calorie  count on all items but not the price. I ordered a few breakfast items and walked out when he told me the price.<//Text>

If you decide the meal isn't worth it and you're gonna share fries with your kid don't bother, the kids meal comes with 10 fries. I can go to Carl's Jr down the street, spend what I just spent here, and my daughter and I can fill ourselves up.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

They didnt even say sorry for the wait time or nothing. This place will not have good customer service until its fix. I asked the cashier if i can just get my fries through her side instead of me waiting 25mins to  get them on the second window and she said their not ready yet that they were making them fresh. So she said they were making them fresh then why did i get my small fries all dry and nasty they wetent for me they were  actually for my 1yr son. Never again stopping by to this location.

<Review>I went to this McDonalds this evening to get dinner for my family.  I ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 2 big macs, 2 fries and a 6 piece mcnugget.  The employee who took my order was friendly and read my order back to me, correct.  The associate who took the money also read my order back correctly.  The employee who gave me my order said it was all there.  I asked if there was extra sauce and she said yes, I was good to go.  However when I got home there were no cheeseburgers.  It wasn't worth driving back my wife said.  "It's McDonalsds, you have to expect that"  I don't.  I expect my order complete.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Hardly a prude, but the drive thru worker was f... this and f... that. With my 3 year old in the car it was offensive. I put a review through their service and did request contact back, never heard from them though, which was also disappointing.< /Text>< pictures>

This location always has gotten my irders wrong!!! And I always go back. Necause its close to my house. Shame on me!!!!
So I take order back and the young mgr on duty just brushes it off likevuts my fault!!! Totally bad customer service!!! She yells at the poor kid watch me open the wrapper...n says u can go over there!!! The owners need to know about these young kids running their business...totally need better supervision. N retraining on customer service!!! Not snotty teen back talk!!!
I will not be going back there ever again!!!! So disappointed!!😒< /Text>< userid>
