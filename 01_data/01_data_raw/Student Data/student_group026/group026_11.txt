< review>
I had been renting my storage from us storage centers for 6 years when it was time for me to close out my account and empty my storage I met Christopher he was so helpful. Christopher was very very kind and professional and I give him an A+. He was very attentive to my needs and I didn't feel rushed. I have rented about 6  storage and the service was the best one. I will recommend this place to anybody and everybody< /review>

<text>Chris and staff were very friendly, professional and honest.  They were flexible in helping me meet my needs and willing to go the extra step.  It made the paperwork process fly by and I am very pleased with my choice in storage units.  I recommend using US Storage in Hemet off State Street.</text>< user_id>

Denise Donnelly helped me out when I was in a bad spot a couple of days after I rented my storage space. I lost the key to the lock and she made it hassle free to replace the lock and helped get me back into the flow of things. Just want to say thank you to her for that! Also, when I first contacted CubeSmart to inquire about renting a space she was super cordial and professional!< /review>

I have rented several storeage units in different locations.  But after my experience with Denise Donnelly I will never rent space anywhere else again other then Cube Smart. From the moment I walked in to pay my bill wich was late , she made me feel as if I was her #1 customer. I have been needing to arrange for a bigger storeage and even a second one close to where we are moving to ? but kept putting it off because there's so many places and sizes and prices to chose from. Denise was able to figure out what exactly I would need and shared with me the great deals I can choose from, including the refer a friend . It was exactly what I needed . Her upbeat personality and sincerest desire she had to give me peace of mind and spend the time showing me how cube smart truely could meet every one of my needs has made me a loyal customer for life.  The experience here has been like a breath of fresh air. Thank you Denise for your help . Now I can focus on our move without worrying about anything related to storeage units.<//review>

From day one when I rented here I have been very pleased.
Denise was the first to help me and, not only
Did she make this a pleasant transaction she helped me get a 20 foot haul truck to my unit. This was no easy task and took About 15 minutes of going forward, backing up. I would not recommend bringing that big of a truck in. Thank God she had patience and was able to help guide me.
I then had a small issue with my lock and I was fortunate enough to get to meet Chanel. What a great person. She switched out my lock straight away.
Another day there was an issue with the gate and they had to close all of a sudden because the gate was t working properly and they needed a part in order to fix it. Wouldn’t you know that was the day that I was meeting someone to pick up 50 boxes of flooring from 2 hours away. Chanel rescued me and I was able to get this done. Chanel and Denise go above and beyond their job description. This is what I not only practice but, truly appreciate. Way to make a customer for life. My slogan when I sell real estate.
Cube smart way to go for hiring such awesome people.
People like these two ladies keep your clients happy and with that it makes us want to refer our friends and family to rent from you.
My only gripe is that rates go up in 6 months. I’m not loving that plan.<//Text>

<text>Channel is incredible. The move-in process (even during the COVID-19 pandemic) was fast and flawless. The price was reasonable with the discount I received. The storage unit although older than expected was clean and ready-to-go. Thank you Channel! It was great to work with you with my self-storage needs.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

<review>I stopped by a few days ago & when I walked in the office I was greeted with 2 amazing smiles. Both Chanell & Denise were very professional & extremely knowledgeable. They assisted me in finding the right size for the best price. I walked in super stressed & walked out feeling refreshed. This type of service don't exist anymore. I will recommend Cube Smart in the future.
Thanks ladies & keep up the good work.< /review>< Pictures>

Horrible customer service. This place has great prices if you ever need help with your storage they do not value their customers the way they should. The only thing they value is the money you spend. If you ever need to negotiate a family circumstance such as the loss of a loved one or a national state of emergency they do not care.<//Review>

<text>I would give 0 stars but that is unfortunately not an option. Cube smart as a whole is ok BUT this specific location is horrible.... management (or I should say lack of) is nonexistent, anytime you try to contact someone directly they are never available you will always have to get in touch with their corporate and then corporate will get in touch with management which is just inconvenient. The main reason I am giving this location a 0 is due to our vacate issue. I called corporate (due to not being able to reach the manager)to inform that I would be moving and gave the date corporate explained that they would send an email to the manager to inform and give the date I would be moving and that the manager would reach out to me (which never happened). A few days later I emailed the manager regarding my move and the date because the only email I had received was an auto email reminding me of my payment. She did respond to my email and confirmed my move and sent all information regarding the vacate process. Day of my move my husband pulls up in the uhaul we just rented for 400$ enters our code and it doesn’t work. We call corporate who then calls the manager and they say the gate is broken and we have to wait till the following day!!!!!!! We were given no notice!!!!! According to the manager it broke the night before which I completely understand things happen but not giving any notice is just completely unprofessional and unacceptable. Luckily uhaul gave us a free day at no charge. Next day I called the corporate office to make sure the gate will be open and when corporate spoke to the emergency contact because manager was unavailable (how convenient) they stated the gate was still down and would be for the next 2 days. My husband had already taken off work and we had already paid for our uhaul I could not even believe that these people do business like this. After a heated conversation with corporate, management said they can manually open the gate. That is what should of happened to begin with!!!! I never write reviews but due to this huge inconvenience and horrible management I believe people should know how business is ran at this location. Beware.< /text>< Pictures>

Just rented from Sure Save American Self Storage and received a great deal and great customer service.  The manager was quite friendly and very helpful.  I feel comfortable leaving my valuables at this facility.

I needed a storage unit for my mom and Chanell was so sweet and helpful. She walked my mom through the entire process and was very knowledgeable. After visiting various storage facilities my mom felt most comfortable storing her items at Cube Smart because of Chanell. The entire process was quick and efficient and a fun experience with Chanell.< /text>

DO NOT RENT A STORAGE UNIT HERE!!!!!!! So disappointed in this place. I trusted these guys to keep my stuff safe. Meanwhile my ex-boyfriend got ahold of my storage unit and let it go to auction. Therefore I lost over 3k worth of furniture and things that had sentimental value to my family and I. I moved down to this area, stayed less than a month and quickly moved back to Northern California. I'm disgusted and at a loss for words by what happened.< /review>

<Time>1408741496807<//Time><rate>2< /rate><text>There was a really nice person when I went to see about getting storage two weeks ago. I went there a few days ago, and what a difference. The woman was new, and didn't make me feel welcome at all. I told my friend who rents there that I didn't feel good about being there anymore so I rented next door. She said met the supervisor of Sure Save American last week and she said that she's just as rude as the new employee because she had negative things to say about the previous employees that we did like, it's STORAGE. No matter how crazy you thought your employee was, she was a lot nicer than what is there now, and how rude and unprofessional of the supervisor!. Needless to say, I rented elsewhere. This really bothers me because I really felt good about the place until the change.< /text>< pics>

They have an excellent selection of edibles to choose from!!  When I first walked in the beautiful Lanae welcomed me. She directed me to spin the wheel and I got 20% off...my brain was like “Whhaaaat?! 🤩” I was glad to have Lanae as a budtender. She was very kind, knowledgeable, and professional. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know 😄👍🏾<//review>

<review>Glad to see the bud tenders aren't just a pretty face behind the counter. They know their products and always have raffles and things for the public. Most importantly, weed is always of good quality and Amiranda will help you find what you like with a lovely attitude!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>I love going to this shop because of the quality of the weed, great customer service, and the ladies are cute.
Tonight, Lerazo served me well. I told her my budget and what I was looking for. So with a quickness she pulled out some fire for me. Thank you. She's a keeper. 😎<//text>< Pics>

Amiranda was super friendly, the way they greet you as soon as you walk in by your name is  actually a nice gesture. Told her exactly what I was looking for and she accommodated me fast and no hassle. Loved my experience!< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I called firehouse after trying to hunt down some kushy punch edibles that other shops said they had in stock and after endless run around it ends up they didn’t. Amarinda from Firehouse responded immediately and texted after my call and my order was set up within 10min and delivered with an hour. Love that the driver has a debit option as well! By far the best delivery service and so happy they had our go-to edible in stock. Will definitely be using again!</Review>< Pics>

Glad they had a brand product I have been looking for, but the male manager there is a skimp. Acts like he doesn't remember things so you can pay full price and not get deals< /review>

<Text>They charge tax, which is a lot, but understandable. They have a good cartridge selection and drinks which is mostly what i go for. Only way to avoid tax, is at early bird happy hour(15% off).<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Firehouse365 is my go-to place in Maywood when there are so many choices. Rodrigo was there once again to make some great recommendations on my birthday.

This is a place you'll find me at every now and again.<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>This place was my go to spot but after tonight's customer service I might have to rethink that. The lady that helped me out was not nice or trying to be of any service. It's my birthday in a few hours and sad to say I'll have to work all day during my birthday so I stopped by right before they closed and asked to get my birthday deal she said no I'll have to come back tomorrow I explain to her how I'll be working all day and wont be able to stop by which is why I'm was there at the time I was and yet she gave me a cold no didnt even try to check with bossman or someone in higher management to see if it can be done she said no and sent me on my way....< /review>< Pictures>

Really nice staff, super helpful. A really nice layout. If they don’t have what your looking for they will make sure to purchase those particular items and have them in stock for you next time you visit. Best shop in Maywood!</Text>

I can’t wait to come back to this place!!! I been looking for a new location where I didn’t feel like I was getting mugged! This place is clean and the staff is so amazing! Zena greeted me in and went above and beyond! Her customer service is outstanding!!! I wish they had one closer to me where I live! But every time in the area I will return!!!!!!!!!< /text>

First time customer at this location and very disappointed. Charged almost $10 in just tax. I've never been charged tax at other dispensaries. Plus no hook up what so ever even as a first time customer. Discounts here are just click bait lol. I pay $60 for my refill cartridge at most dispensaries and paid $68 and that which included a 15% discount. Would of been more then $70 without it. RIP OFF.<//review>

This place just opened up near my work and it’s gotta be the best place in Maywood! Erica helped me out and she was the absolute sweetest!!! She was so patient and answered all my questions gracefully. I FOR SURE will be coming to Firehouse more often....prices are more reasonable than Cookies and to be honest quality is top notch....I highly recommend this place if you’re looking for good service and product with great prices< /text>

Total mini hidden gem in Maywood. Total blackout from the outside, but a very clean, neat, and quaint on the inside. First-time patient here, and I was really impressed with my budtender, Amber. She's very knowledgeable and very customer-friendly. She gives you honest opinions and make your visit a real breeze. Firehouse on FIYAH indeed. Come support this quaint but professional little shop of wonders! I know I DO!< /Text>

<Text>I took a tour of the apartments a month ago and I can say without a doubt it is one of the nicest complexes I’ve seen. My family and I took a tour with Earnest.

<Text>You couldn't pay me to live here again. Lived here for a 1.5 yrs and could not wait to leave. The amount of trashy people who moved here increased dramatically from the day I moved in. People are inconsiderate and are loud all hours of the day. Yes the apartments are nice and updated, but the neighbors make this place trashy and an unpleasant place to live.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I’ve had to call the leasing office multiple times today for different reasons and every person I spoke to did an incredible job! From adding a new roommate to fixing minor maintenance issues, every request was answered within the day! For having over 400 units, they really take care of you. Shoutout to Stacy, Ernest, Danny and Johnathan!<//text>

I don’t think the reviews are very accurate of this place many are old and outdated as many changes have occurred this past year. I’ve lived here for a year now and have no issues. The apartment was newly renovated, they redid all the pools, and amenities. The landscaping is beautiful. Very dog friendly but haven’t had any issues with constant  barking. My only two minor complaints are that they force you to pay for a door to door trash service which is $25 or $35 and results in people leaving trash bags in the hallway. I’d rather they do away with the service and just increase rent that much. The other complaint is that they never answer the leasing office phone and it takes awhile for them to call you back if they even do. However if you walk in they are very helpful. Overall very happy with this place and will be renewing my lease.</review>

I would give it five stars but they have a 25 dollar valet trash service which really adds to your expenses. It's an unnecessary fee because dumpsters are right next to the buildings. They were fairly disorganized when we moved in but the agency recently took over when we moved in. Stacy is great.</text>< pictures>

<text>Apartments are nice, and the area is great but the one star is for the management at the leasing office. They have no clue what they are doing, one person will tell you one thing and then someone else will tell you something else. One of the workers there never knows anything she always says let me check with my manager who is not in, and then never gets back to you. They also never answer their phones, and do not know how to train their staff on policies on the complex. I know this complex is large, but they should be able to do their job or at least hire more people to help do the job.< /text>< user>

I have to say the new gym at Veranda La Mesa is insane! All the upgrades and money the new owners are putting into the place are well spent. Ive been here for many years and lived through many owners and the last one really let the place go. The new tennis court/basketball court is awesome, the fresh paint on the buildings helps immensely, thank you for finally figuring out the parking situation (I'm very happy Con Am is gone). And, as always, thank you for keeping Jenn employed. She's awesome :).<//Review>

So this place sucked when it was Alvista but since the management has changed and they hired a gentleman by the name of Erin this place has seen a change for the better, Erin has been going out of his way to see that maintenance requests are met quickly and promptly and he listens to the tenets issues and concerns<//Text>

A lot of inconsistencies with management. My husband and I have been living here for 3 months, suddenly we get a notice that we have been paying the wrong amount on the rent and that we haven't paid utilities. Called and asked ,  they couldn't provide the break down of the balanced due. Moreover,  every month I've asked and written the check for the rent right I front of them, so how is it that we have been paying the wrong amount?! Makes no sense. In addition, my husband checks the mail EVERY day ! No bill was ever sent, we just figured that was also included in the rent. GUESS NOT. Avoid this place, it's pricey for the service and quality of apartments. I do not tend to write reviews , I think always thought people just like to be mean, but this is just ridiculous. I'm a very mellow person and tend to keep to myself but I just couldn't let go. If I can save one person from moving in here with this review, I'll take it. You can find better , trust me. Or don't , just prepare yourself for the inconvenience.< /review>

I would give it no stars. I wanted to lease here and came in to see the apartment. We loved it. We where told by Aaron that the deposit was 800 and a prorate for the month which we where ok with. We were told to come back next to finalize everything. Came back the next day with cashier's check in hand . Met by Aaron again and said im im sorry the price is almost 1000 more I made a mistake. Well I was told the 800 before plus prorate I should get it. I will be telling everyone not to rent here. Need employees here that put customer first and not try to pocket extra money because that's what it seems like< /text>

I have lived here for too long, its pricey, but the location is excellent.. Wish I could say the same for the management. Parking is terrible. Everything is centered around you getting in not keeping you there. Getting in touch with anyone is impossible. When ever you call you get voice mail and far too often you get the MAILBOX is FULL Call back later when you repeat the same farce. I don't even try to use the washer and dryers anymore. I think the management is trying to get better but a first step would be answering the phone and listening.<//Review>

I loved this place for the first year I lived here. However In the second year, rent went up 200$. The pools were dirty for half the year, and the place was less and less clean. They also charge a 25$ mandatory trash collection fee. The trash is next to the entrance, I cant really understand this but ok. I realized that after my rent went up I had some crazy bills for utilities.  By the end I did the math and I had overpaid rent by 500$. I went to talk to them and they just brushed me out the door.  It was new staff that took over since Alvista on Baltimore was now Veranda La Mesa. My rent that use to be 1335$ was now 1650$ plus utilities. No upgrades or addition benefits for the extra rent amount. When I moved, I called a cleaning company and also went to verify that it was clean. I had pictures and video of the place, it was spot clean. Few weeks later I got a refund for my deposit. They charged MAXIMUM for everything they were able to. Including cleaning fees. They also charged for wear and tear even that I was told when I moved in that we are taking a NON upgraded apartment, and everything was going to get replaced once I moved out. They also charged a utility bill of 296.27$ but provided a bill for 74.28$ for the last month. I disputed these charges and for the first few weeks I got a response and the girl agreed that it was a mistake but never send a new check out.  Here I am 120 days later and had to cash the 375$ refund check before it expired instead of 750$. Shady practices,  if it was more I would take them to court but it is not even worth my time at this point. It was nice before Veranda La Mesa took over.</text>

Love this place! I’ve lived here three different times and I love it more and more each time. Personal opinion aside I’d say the pros and cons are as follows.
Pros:
Safe community!
Pet friendly
Beautiful landscaping
Charming apartments
Super friendly and helpful staff
Valet service to pick up your trash and recycling from outside your front door! (Thank you convenience!)
Located 20 minutes from the beaches or Balboa park/Zoo without higher prices of downtown apartments.

Cons:
Normal cons of apartment living
You’re close to your neighbors-can’t be helped
Parking can be tricky-but you can opt in for a reserved covered parking spot
It is pet friendly so sometimes you hear dogs and sometimes you smell dogs
Some people smoke which is annoying and inconsiderate but that isn’t a reflection on Alvista, just your neighbors.

All in all you could do SO much worse than to sign a lease here. Alvista on Baltimore definelty feels like home and I’m going to miss it.</Review>

The office has poor service. Almost always has a sign that said "We'll be back at....time" and they are never back at such time. They also take a long time to put in a simple request. I have asked to add another name to my leisure and just keep telling me that they will take 2 days...it has been a month and nobody can help me still. Also,  in certain places has urine smell from pets.</Review>

<text>I haven't had hot water for five days. The office acts like its news to them every time I call. I overheard their staff talking about it saying it was my whole building and they don't know how to fix it. I have never written a review in my life. This is not acceptable. I have a giant hole in my ceiling I have addressed the office about numerous times. It leaks whenever it rains. Their solution was to give me a bucket. This place is scary! I've found people shooting up in the laundry room. I've had five or six packages delivered to my door that were stolen.  My trash can was even stolen. The cops are here every other night. Scary, scary, scary. The only positive thing I will say about this place is that even though the staff is clueless they are mostly friendly and the dog parks are great. Don't move here It is not safe.< /text>< pictures>

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE ....when you move out they will try and lie and take your security deposit and say that your apartment was bad but was not and then when you go to contact them you get unprofessional management they will talk to you like you are nothing to them . My husband is in the military and we move often and I have never stayed at a place like this and the place is out dated for the money nasty bathroom had mold on it when moved AND behind the fridge there was stuff left from other renter's had to clean it my self upon are move in but then when you move out they will try and say you left them a mess when I cleaned that place better then what they gave it to us in that contain.  I understand normal wear and tear but come on be far and I hope this place dose not do the same to others . I wish I could say good things about this place. If you are thinking to rent from here I would find else where my personal experience.< /review>

Management always forgets to call back residents. The security lady on patrol nightly is absolutely ridiculous and rude to residents , threatening them with tickets for violations that don't even exist . When I first moved here it was great, now it's not worth the steep rent at all. New residents moving in are loud , many of which stumble around drunk every hour of the day. Best advice , look elsewhere for a better price and far better living situation :)< /text>

Save your time and money. I’ve been living here since July, it’s overpriced for what it is. Apartments beneath us had leaks, and our apartment was ripped apart and not thought about for months until I called in for the second time to maintenance. Go somewhere else, I know I will be.</review>

So i just moved here and so far the place isnt to bad but it is a little expensive for what you get the apts look big but thats only the bedrooms and the living room the bathroom and kitchens are tiny and there is no designated dining area and a lot of the patios are unfinished and the apts aren't very secure seeing that there is no extra lock on the doors but the place isnt all bad its very clean and the staff are super friendly and there are plenty of dog parks bbq grills and pool areas throughout the complex and all the apts have built in a/c units and heating

Update: 6/19/2019 so ive been at this apt complex for about 8 months and it hasn't gotten a lot better the management doesn't answer the phone most of the time and i personally feel like the issues i bring up are just ignored ive even left emails and still got no response im still waiting on requests i made back in the first month of living here the only good news i have in relation with my previous review is they finished some of the patios and put in a new gym< /Text>

<Text>Terrible service, someone always forgets what's going on at the office, they dont notify each other etc...  heard too many bad stories from too many tenants that are moving out this year including myself. NEVER answer their phone! I've called many times from my apt only to walk over and see someone sitting there. Rent is very expensive for the area. Ridiculous. Only Pro is that they dont seen to have breed restrictions anymore and have a decent size dog park... watch out poop everywhere, been a problem 6 years straight.< /Text>< UserId.>

Trying to reach the leasing office in San Diego is the most frustrating experience as the call always gets routed to the Alvista apartments in Long Beach.

Get your act together and offer the correct number so that people can actually 4th m reach you here in San Diego not Long Beach.<//Review>

No longer a safe complex to live in.

I've lived at this complex for 5 years now going on 6, even upgrading from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom at one point.

My wife lamented to me last night that she no longer feels safe walking the dog around the complex or living here.

In the last year and a half the complex has gone way downhill. We've had car windows broken twice, both times while being parked in the covered parking area.

A man, who the "security" personnel knew about and had already spoken to and called the cops on, went around throwing rocks into multiple cars parked at the complex. The guy was screaming threats at the building for over an hour. Security neither saw nor heard anything.

This place has been rotating through staff so quickly I can't even keep track of who works here anymore. They've also gone through many different security companies. At least now they found one that doesn't actually seem to exist.

They implemented a garbage pickup service recently, but they don't enforce their own policy. Now trash and trash cans sit out in hallways 24/7. You can also see lines of garbage fluid that were dragged through the hallways.

The office staff also let slip that they charge flat fees when people move out, which, you guessed it, is illegal in California.

The good: The maintenance staff is extremely nice and they do good work. They are also consistently employed so you get to know them, and they know their stuff.

The grounds are green. One of the reasons we liked the complex was the trees and the grass. We also used to brag about how safe the area was.</Review>

<review>I have lived here two years, and know many of the residents.  Everyone who has ever lived here moves as quickly as possible, this place is absolutely terrible. Laundry facilities do not work, pool and hot tub are dirty and always down, police are always in the area dealing with drug dealers/break ins/noise complaints. Dogs attack your animals at the dog park, and the staff are aggressive, rude, and just ugly people in general.
Go to yelp/google, and read the REAL reviews, not the company reviews below. ( There is zero security at night )
Good luck.

Just completely failing....

Wait, the Maintenance staff are amazing... thats about it unfortunately.< /review>< Pictures>

I lived there for 1.5 years and it started off fine. I paid no water, no trash disposal,  and no sewage. The rent was 1196, the walls lots of chipped paint from over painting, and mold on the tub ,but other than that it seemed to be fine. When I renewed my lease my rent went up $50 and in addition I had to start paying for water,  trash disposal, and sewage. When I moved out I cleaned my place top to bottom very well and thorough to avoid any reason to not get my security deposit back. I turned my keys in and about 2 weeks later I received a statement of Deposit from alvista claiming to have taken money out of my deposit for painting,  carpet cleaning,  and house cleaning. I received around $115 out of $500. I contacted the manager via email because that's how they handle their disputes but I wanted to know why they charged me so much money. I felt robbed!  I received a response from the manager days later stating that it cost them more than what they charged and asked if I would like a new statement of Deposit for the amount due.  I tried to contact her to talk and she took 5 days to get back to me. She was very rude and had no interest in solving the issue.  Although she did mention she would provide photos.  So I decided to talk to her boss.  I had heard nothing in days so I went down to the office and I talked to her about the issue and to my surprise they said they lost the photos and they would refund me my money. I expressed to her how I felt and that they shouldn't treat there tenants like that in a reasonable tone and professional manner. She said that I was intimidating her and made comments to insinuate that she would call the cops on me and had no interest in solving the problem. It wasn't until I talked to her boss that she changed her tone, acted more professional, and showed interest in what I had to say.</Text>

< Review>
I lived at Alvista for 2 years and it was just okay. The office staff is friendly, but ineffective. I complained several times about a neighbor who was locking up her dog for 10-12 hours a day and letting it bark and howl all day long. The when I talked to office staff they always took the time to make note of my complaints, but ultimately nothing was ever done about the dog.

The doors are very heavy and often slam loudly. Most of my neighbors were respectful and made sure they closed the door by hand, but some neighbors went in and out at all times of the night letting that door slam. I lost count of how many times I was jolted awake at night by a crashing, slamming door.

They were very good at cracking down on smokers and people who don't pick after their dogs, and I really appreciated that. There was always plenty of parking, and in general I always felt safe here, even on the first floor. It's a great place to live if you have a dog, and they even have a large fenced area to let dogs off leash.

I think if they can install a device on the apartment doors to prevent them from slamming, it would be a much nicer place to live. This seems like such a little thing, but to be jolted awake, or even just startled by that crashing door made my experience at Alvista less than perfect.

In response to the reviewers who complained about not getting their full deposit back... the lease is very clear about the charges on move out. If you live there for less than two years, there are some charges the renter is responsible for. Ask questions and read your lease to avoid misunderstandings.

Full disclosure, I didn't clean anything before I left. I was moving back to Minnesota and I didn't have time. I gave them a $750 deposit and got back $507. This was more than satisfactory for me.</Review>

2 stars because
1) tiny. i am 5'5" & bump my head on the shower head, cuz of the poor water pressure. i bump my elbows on doorways, counters etc. This apt could be opened up take out walls and extra closet space and make a decent studio with solid parts.
2) cheap. the complex is solid, but everything in here is paper mache, stuff breaks often, it's disposable parts. the water is a constant issue, they are constantly working on it, often it gets shut off, it now dribbles at best from kitchen or bathroom sinks, i have to do dishes in the bathtub.
3) maintenance staff has been kind, but the office has been surprisingly mistake prone and uncoordinated. Yet, you will get zero breaks and zero empathy should you be 5 minutes late with rent.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I wish I could give no stars, I live in between these apartments in another apartment building and I have put in a complaint twice about 2 dogs constantly barking, and there has been nothing done about it, soooo I guess my next step is to call the police and animal control. I work from home and its frustrating to hear dogs barking ALL DAY....<//review>

Where do I start with this place... the reason we picked this complex was the dog park, which is great! Most people who go there are super friendly and have awesome dogs! But that's about all we care for and there has been talk about the big dog park being removed for a new leasing office... the staff here is nice don't get me wrong but they are terrible. My water was cold for two months and my tub leaked for three. My smoke detector went off every time I used the damn oven before it even had food in it because of the heat and I had windows open and all fans on! My bedroom smells like weed 70% of the time because of our neighbors and the office hasn't done anything, the walls are painted with the shittiest paint I've ever seen, every door and drawer in this place was painted and then closed and opened so the paint is clumped, torn, and sticks. All the windows and the cocking around the shower are moldy ,and my tub has had a Chunk missing since we moved in and when maintenance came to stop the tub from dripping they didn't do anything about it. let me tell you I'm a clean freak and have tried cleaning the mold from them. They have no way to enforce people to clean up after pets so every grassy area is full of dog crap! There is always atleast 2 dryers down or a washing machine. They spend so much time and I'm sure money on redoing the grounds and stupid concrete that they seriously neglect the appartments. I constantly have water pressure issues now too. It seems to me and my dog park buddies that this complex cares more about getting new renters than keeping the ones they have which is a shame because we love the location and my dogs have made friends here and so have I. I really hope the staff gets it together and tries to improve the apts without trying to keep upping the rent... with such poor resident satisfaction , or at least make sure they fix the problems in a timely and efficient Manor. I never write reviews and I'm sorry it's all over the place but I wish I had seen more when I found this place so I hope this helps some of you weigh out your options better.< /review>

We have lived here for about a year and we liked it when we first saw it and moved in. The rent is calculated very oddly first of all, if you want to sign for a year it's one price. They give you options to sign a lease anywhere from 1 month to a year, somehow if you sign a lease for say 8 months it's more expensive then renting for 7 months. Odd. But our experience has not been great living here. One thing that attracted us to alvista is that they are dog friendly. However, in the common areas, people let their dogs poop all over the place and don't bother to pick it up. Disgusting and a super way for diseases to spread, pretty sure you don't want your dog to get sick right? Then there's a pool and jacuzzi. Several in the massive complex in fact. Cool! Not! Our jacuzzi constantly is dirty and non residents frequent it as well because they don't lock it up. Our jacuzzi also CONSTANTLY overflows and we pay for water in our complex so I wonder how much we pay to let them waste water? Then there janky maintenance people, our air conditioner has put out a funky smell since we moved in and we called for maintenance several times and they send the same guy to "fix" it but it's still gross and I've told them and it's like a "huh" response so we gave up on that. The woman that gave us our keys when we moved in was too lazy to do a walk through with us so she said "don't tell anyone but I'll let you do your own walk through since we are about to close, don't tell anyone though haha" seriously? The tenant turnover rate is high and I know why now. They painted our stairs and railings but never bothered to notify anyone or put up wet paint signs. Oh and they're redoing the floor by the pool and laundry room now and at the last minute, after they already started work on it, let us know that we can't access the pool or laundry for a few days due to unforeseen issues. I saw it about a week ago when they started but somehow the office didn't. Oh and they blocked off areas because of wet paint that I'm sure they knew would be blocked off but failed to mention it in their note. A tree fell outside of our apartment and blocked the entrance out of our apartment and access to our cars for 3 days without anyone coming to remove it. I literally almost killed myself trying to get to my car so I could get to work and get my dog out to go to the bathroom. I had to call the office and tell them they needed to get some out to remove it. They also make you pay for a valet trash service even if you don't want it nor use it. I have had my parking spot, that I pay monthly for, given to two other tenants because no one ever wrote the correct spot number down for the one in which I pay for AND when we went to resign our lease they STILL didn't have the right number for mine or my husbands which we again pay for! Oh and we resigned a lease only because they notified us that we needed to resign it without much notice and that our rent was being raised. We are currently looking for a new place. They charge a ridiculous amount for rent but say it's in line with other apartments in the area that have similar amenities. Well I'm guessing their business practices are better at these other places if nothing else and most likely have done more then slap a new coat of paint on them and jack up the rents. Alvista on Baltimore is a true facade. Looks nice till you live here. Don't fall for it. Don't rent here. Don't waste your time or money.<//review>

Back again for a taste of this delicious cuisine!Born out of true love of food...from generations  blessed with the ability to create "Food for Spirit"...not just body...Ali, Master Chef Owner's life is in this brilliant Restaurant!
Decades of delicious Halel  catering...San Diego to Fresno...Bakersfield to Sacramento...Los Angeles to Riverside...speaks for itself!
There are only a few of these true culinary masters around so when I find one I'm in my "nirvana".
Such a kind, soft-spoken gentle man, knocking brilliant 5☆ food out of his kitchen...every time!
One of the top 10 best! With pleasure...<//Review>

Very lousy service, pathetic food, Mr. Barkat  was rude with us ladies, they over charged us for the food for 2 dishes. We order Bihari kobob and Chicken Karahi water Nan, there bill was $84. We asked them why, they replied because of Eid. Very greedy, they call them selfs Muslim, take advantage of ladies and Muslim festivals. We want to call police, but we did not  because it will be disgraceful for Muslim image. I hope someone will teach them lesson to not take of advantage of ladies and fetivals. They forced us leave by 7 pm they have to close restaurant for false narritive that have to close the restaurant because of government order. We checked they lied.<//Text>

I really like their Korma! If your ordering the Tundori Chicken get the smaller pieces because you only get two pieces in the larger order. Overall, good food.< /Text>

My family is very particular about getting Desi food as takeout because it always tastes homemade, and not like the street food or “Shaadi ke khaaney Waala Taste” that we are so used to from back home.

After reading all of the positive reviews, we tried the food from here for the first time and I can easily say that the taste definitely lived up to the praise.

We are so glad to have found this place and we will be coming here regularly!<//Text>

<Review>Excellent menu, authentic Pakistani Food, really tasty and fresh. This place has area for pray. If you are in rush it is recommended to order over phone before you arrive for the dinner.
Lack of cleaning is noticeable.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-EB7f8deBoxMjOkiTf_AHfqgbUh7lMEftagVV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY0UYwra-4gV4fmSsuFmfLgaCvUhgq_r6Fb5oK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c32c68bb8cc53d:0xcc078632d5f5351e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Nice place on the inside, even though the outside may not look like much. Food tasted great and service was very quick. I recommend everyone in the Brea/Diamond Bar area to definitely try this place.
Most of the food is served on these trays that have candles under them, so the food stays warm. Super cool idea!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I go to Aashiyana a lot. Due to covid 19 we've been doing call-ins but the food is just as delicious.

I love their shami kabaab, chicken Tikka, and naan.<//text>

The food their was enjoyable but unless you knew hindi/urdu, some of the servers couldn't understand you. Personally I love their food I would recommend their chicken sheek kabob or their chicken tikka it is very delicious.

Just spoke to an employee at the restaurant.He was reluctant to provide his name after I asked who was their meat supplier and if the meat was hand slaughtered halal.

I didn't get his name but he did provide me with Bayfood Meat Spice. I asked him to provide me with their phone number of their supplier and the guy acted like he was sweating bullets over the phone.

He got really nervous and asked why was I asking and went into this shpeel about how they have been serving halal for 49 years. Really, I could care less how many years you've been serving "halal" food for I just need to know who is your supplier.

Bayfood meat spice. He said his boss orders the meat. Then he said he was the manager. I asked well if you can't provide your name can you provide your last name. Nope. He did say his boss's name was Akbar Ali.  Bayfood meat spice doesn't exist on google.
I'd appreciate if Akbar Ali can leave a comment reply on who their meat supplier is.</text>

I have never experienced such bad service in my life. I had to literally get up every time I needed to get a hold of the waiter. They kept forgetting items I asked for and I was needing to repeat myself multiple times. The manager was a joke. I ordered the boneless chicken and it was so hard and raw. This place needs to either hire more people or train the ones to at least check on their customers rather than making people wait so long for the raw food they serve. Never going back!!</Review>

<Date>1546157090816< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>Went to this hotel on 29th December, Saturday night for a family dinner. What I thought would be an enjoyable Indian dinner turned out to be a bad experience for me. We unfortunately were accompanied by a group of loud and rude people who probably thought that they owned the place. In spite of requesting multiple times to keep their voices down (me and guests on other tables), they not only kept up their rhetoric but also mocked us and upped their antics. The bad part was that the hotel staff and management did nothing to stop this despite our requests (other than the waiter meekly telling them to lower their voices but to no effect). I am not sure if any other restaurant would have tolerated such indecent behavior. Although the food was above average, the overall experience was forgettable.</text>< Pictures>

Nice to have more halal restaurants whenever we are traveling.

Recommend the Haleem because it was the best of what we had to eat. But the Naan backside was burned! I noticed the naan was burned at a table nearby so I specifically asked the waiter to to be careful and not to burn ours. The top was fine but the bottom was inedible.< /text>

I went To This Place Abt A Year Ago, Food was Really Good , nice and Pakistani Taste (better then many In Neighbourhood)
But Unfortunately their were some Issues with Management and Hospitality  :The Serving staff was not that Good
I heard they Have Made Some Improvements
I hope My Next Visit Will Force me to Write a Better review

There was a lot wrong with my personal experience in this reastraunt. First and foremost wait time. I understand that it takes longer towards the night to get all the food out but you can at least take the order. I waited over half an hour to place and order. Beyond this not all the food was properly cooked all the way through. I wanna go back to wait time for a minute. While I waited for my food a few other couples came into the reastraunt. The waiters took less than 10 minutes to be at their table taking orders and an additional 18 minutes to prepare and serve the food. All the while I've been waiting for over an hour for my food. I can forgive a lot but this experience is one I cannot forgive.< /Text>

I have eaten here a few times and quite liked the food in the past. Well, both the service and food have went downhill since. The waiters were rude, seems so busy in chit chatting. The food quality has dropped and prices has increased insanely high. Why am I paying $14+ a plate for Chicken plate with more bones and less chicken and no air-conditioning. I do not recommend this place. There are other places with better food close enough by. This place has seen better days.<//text>

<Review>We went to Aashiyana with friends on Saturday, and had a very bad experience. While the food at Aashiyana is good, the experience wasn't.

The serving lady was rude, which she was the last time we went as well. We were having a nice meal when my 1 year old woke up all cranky, and efforts to soothe her weren't helping. A little while later, the serving lady came upto us and asked us, in her usual rude manner, to get the baby to quiet down because their guests were getting disturbed. I assume she was talking about the guests in their banquet hall because the diners in the restaurant did not seem affected. Kids cry, that's what they do. My husband, a little annoyed with her "request" said that we were doing all we could, we don't enjoy our baby crying either. There were four kids at our table, none of them running around, none of them being rowdy, just one who was crying- something that kids do!

Once the meal ended, however, and it was time to leave, our friend asked to see the manager to tell them about this incident, and the manager, instead of apologizing, started telling us how to parent by telling us that he saw us and we did nothing to calm the baby down (Umm...hello?! We took her out, but we don't owe you an explanation), and how when his kids were little he always knew how to handle their crying and, among other things, he said 'agar bache paalne nahin aate toh paida kyun karte hain' (If you don't know how to raise kids, why do you have them?). That was the worst! Nobody is allowed to say something like that to anyone, ever!

I have to say that we have dined with our kids at many different places, some fancy, some not, and we have never been spoken to this way, or been told to get our kids to quiet down when they cried. This has got to be our worst experience ever. Aashiyana had no signs that said children under a certain age weren't allowed there. If you allow children in, you're a family restaurant, and this is what happens when families dine at your restaurant- kids cry- and as a restaurant that caters to everyone, you have got to deal with it.

Very upsetting experience. Never going back there. If the management is reading this, please train your staff better, and ask them to keep their parenting opinions to themselves. Thank you.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c32c68bb8cc53d:0xcc078632d5f5351e< /GmapID></record>

Visited Aashiana and ordered food. My friend asked the waiter to change the plates as we had an appetizer and the plates had chutney on it. The waiter took the plates to change but the owner akbar told him that they couldn’t change the dishes as we had only ordered one dish, which is not true. Akbar came to our table and said that we had to eat in the same plates and that’s all they could offer!!! We were stunned by this man who is supposedly in the hospitality service industry !!! So we left and intend never to go back to Aashiana ever again!! Such a rude owner who has no idea what service is all about!!!wowwww< /review>

Bad food quality and very disappointing service. It's not the same ashiyana as it used to be despite the fact its the same management/ownership. Prices are rediculously high as compare to the food taste and quality. These guys really need some serious attention to their quality and overall improvement!</Text>

Excellent Pakistani Food. Excellent Beef and Chicken Dishes. Much better than several restaurants in the neighborhood. I have eaten at all of them many times.
The above remarks are from late 2016 or early 2017. Same management stills runs the place. I dont think they have ever repainted it.

October 24, 2018
I called ahead and inquired about daily specials  Paya was recommended. I asked if there were beef pieces in it  I was told "Absolutely".

There was not a shred of beef in the dish. It was most generic and tasteless Payas I have ever eaten. This dish was not bad tasting.  It had no taste. It had less taste than a coated aspirin pill.

I conveyed my feelings to another server and asked if I could get a small side order of Dal for a charge, of course. Without the slightest of concern I was told my only option was a full order of Dal.

I had above average food here several times. Don't expect any courtesy. Even if you vomit, the restaurant will insist on full payment and for sure not offer to swap your dish/s. No way, not in this life time.

They may be in United States  They have learned nothing.<//review>

Food isn't great. And service is abominable.

I made two online orders 2.5 hours before delivery time. They cancelled the second order 30 mins AFTER the expected delivery time. And they delayed pickup for the first order 1 hour PAST delivery time.

I called to ask why, and they didn't even have multiple orders. Just my 1 order that they didn't cancel.

They literally could not handle 1 online order.<//text>

<review>This is a good place to enjoy old ,nasty filthy chicken biryanies and other delicious nasty old food.
The staff and the management are very unprofessional and rude.
Will never suggest this place to any decent families and sophisticated people.
If still someone wanna give it a try than please take "Anti-Diarrheal" pills with you !</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Take credit cards

The lentis called DAL is excellent and the bread called paratha is great to eat with the Nihari ( a spicy roast beef).
Awesome food the best cooked desi food.< /text>

<review>I used the Top load machines because I didn't have much laundry to do and two of my loads came out with some sort of sand or powder residue that I didn't understand why since I only use liquid detergent and I therefore found myself re-washing my clothes in the 2 loads machines without anything else ( just the clothes) to make sure that they get super rinsed out, etc. The Dryers are not hot enough because what normally takes 9-10 minutes to dry it took 40 to 50 minutes to Dry. I Definitely will not Return.< /review><user_name>Maria Sepulveda< /user_name>< GmapID>

Place is decent. There's always a few dryers that are out of order. Ladies who work there are not the friendliest. This place is always packed unless you come later at night. However i do like that they have 80lb washers and you can get all your clothes done in one wash. They have a customer restroom as well. Last wash is at 830 and they close at 10.They also have a back entrance. They do have a restroom but you have to ask for it to be opened.</text>

I like the staff and they keep the place very neat. The only thing I don't like about them is that it says they open at 6 AM but sometimes they open around 6:15 AM.,  other than that they are very good.</Review>

I'm updating the review from 5 stars to 3.
I normally would give 5 stars to Bonchon as I loved them since the beginning. I'm also glad there is one in San Mateo instead of the Sunnyvale location which is much further. However, I'm taking off 2 stars because the spicy flavor is completely off. It's almost NOT spicy at all. When I get them from Sunnyvale the spicy ones have more red chili specks and tastes much better. There is already a choice for people who doesn't like spicy but for those who choose the spicy flavor, make the wings as spicy as it should have been. I'm also upset that last time I ordered 2 combos where I asked 1 to be half and half and the other to be all spicy, the ones I got are both half and half. The only good thing about this location is that they do prepare food quickly.  The picture can show you how the spicy one looks like as you can tell there is barely any sauce on the chicken.<//review>

Solid KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). The new sweet and spicy sauce is a must try. The family meals are a good deal. Zucchini fries (and the sauce they come with) are incredible. The tteokbokki though can sometimes be off. Easy, quick, yummy dinner for takeout.</Text>

Love the soy garlic sauce. It's sweet, salty and absolutely sinful! The medium combo was more than enough for two (had 2 drumstick leftover)<//Review>

LONG time wait!! :( ordered via website & was told a specific p/u time. Had to wait over an hour from when I ordered until it was ready. :( Apparently the mobile orders all came @ the same time & messed up the preparation for all orders. but it was worth the crispness!  wished the soy garlic  flavor was more BAM ! ;)<//text>

Best chicken wings in town.  Korean style wings are always a winner. If the spicy sauce is too hot for you, be sure to ask for a side of ranch dressing.</Text>

Really like the crispy skin which is hard to achieve with air fryer at home. Hard to pickup as the street for the store front is closed for street dining due the pandemic. Plan ahead with quarters for parking.<//Text>

The chicken was fresh and super crispy, but that's about all there was going for it. The sauce was mediocre (and there wasn't much of it on the chicken at that). And the chicken strips were dry. The food is way overpriced considering how forgettable it tasted.

Service was okay. They were nice, but I felt rushed at times. It certainly wasn't good enough to warrant an automatic 15% tip (we were a party of 2).

No reason to come back. There are tastier options (that offer better value too) in San Mateo.</text>

They have the best chicken wings. Every time I go to a party, I would get some chicken wings here and everyone would love me because the chicken wings are good. If you want to be the center of attention at parties and being loved by everyone, buy these. Their radish is good too eat veggies everyone.< /review>

Simple guilty pleasure with the wings and tropical lemonade. The drink was fresh and delicious, very much matched with the food.</review>

Soju cocktail mango favorites drink is good, first Sip it has strong alcohol taste but the aftertaste is pretty smooth and sweet with the mango favorite. I order a medium combo with 1/2 spicy and half sweet and crunchy. But both taste pretty sweet to me. When I asked I find out they make a mistake so just get a spicy sauce dip on the side.  the chicken taste average not sure if I will go back for the chicken but the drink.  the service need to be improved.<//review>< pics>

Now i know thats a statement but im not giving it loosely, this place is the bomb.
I had my doubts about the soy flavor chicken wings but OMG they are ducking crispy and tasty !!
Ditch the spicy version stay with the soy glazed ones.
And yeah the wheat tea is cute too (its bottomless)

Now whenever i need wings, i go to bonchon !! Period ! Go and enjoy !</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5eQI-iw4V_6xTu0n7RNowsXefry9W0KsOt3Xs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeYkxSyZ4uFqI5ClihBEfy4dFXwXZntrvP6uAH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6F8eOMW9NAJqdvNYUyrVSdhrRN0E5b1dJ6S1K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6bGYEOZc4nyAUCIPVQf-BmF9Gty1fLqUmnAHP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5uMy-Cc4VoBIBUBAeCuoOuCjY63iH9HksFEe3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnC71ugU2Se56Ak_9TTP6CbSP5AtASvE8Uv8dw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f9e708df130eb:0x35a54fcebf7083a<//gmap_id></record>

Good flavors although the chicken was a bit on the dryer side and thinner than expected but did have a good crunchy coating. I liked the soy garlic sauce more than the spicy. I ordered the 10 piece 50/50 ($13.95) and that comes with cole slaw (good and fresh) or pickled radish (no substitutions) which is easily enough for two or a really hungry person. They weren't very hot when served and neither was the steamed rice ($2.25) and they claim it's made to order (up to 30 minutes) but I think mine came out in less than 10.

Service was attentive for the most part. Automatic 15% gratuity included for everyone. Draft beers are $5 (Sapporo, Lagunitas IPA, Blue Moon, California Lager)
Happy hour $4 drafts (M-F 430-6). There's a couple of TVs.< /Text>

<text>A place known for their hot wings does not disappoint. Monday through Thursday they have a $1 wing and $3 beer special. 4 flavors to choose from, we selected spicy and soy ginger which were both good. Recommend a visit especially for the weekly special, look forward to trying the other flavors next time around.</text>< pics>

The chicken wings have a good crunch without being too dried but there is a very limited selection of flavors (soy garlic, sweet crunch, and spicy). The spicy flavor is no joke (tear inducing) and it would be much better if they offered options of mild, moderate, and very spicy. The seasoned fries were pretty good but the japchae was bland and lacking in ingredients.</text>

<review>I never heard of Bonchon. Since I first walk in the place was packed. Very busy, well it all because of the delicious chicken. I recommend to call in advance and order. I prefer to go. It's a small place, I like some elbow room. That's just me. But if u have time to wait. I recommend it.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Bonchon was a fun, family-friendly experience. We ordered a lot of small plates and shared everything. This made it so easy for the picky eaters to choose what they liked. The food was decent - our table really enjoyed the house fried rice and bulgogi sliders. The service was friendly, too.< /review>

Wasn't entirely impressed with the chicken here. I had heard it was close and very authentic to Korean Fried chicken~ but was slightly disappointed by the experience. I did enjoy the crispy, tender chicken and the overall flavor. But I wish that this particular location would be more generous with the sauce. Would still recommend to others~ and look forward to trying some more options another time.</review>

Spicy chicken is so amazing!!! Their quality has not dropped since we started visiting two years ago! A word of advice.. If you are heading here for dinner Friday-Sunday.. Go early.. They tend to be extremely busy! The staff tends to be friendly and accommodating.<//Review>

Staff were friendly and attentive. Clean dining area, but since it is a small place, I felt a little cramped. It can be noisy when it is crowded. Food came to the table in a timely manner. My wings were hot, crunchy, and hit with the right amount of soy garlic. Eight wings were plenty for me. I only at 4 and I was already satisfied. Great lunch. I would recommend it if you like korean fried chicken.</review>

A bit of a wait on weekend nights to be seated. Chicken takes awhile to arrive too so get some apps and drinks beforehand. Recommend getting 75% soy and 25% spicy wings.<//Text>

Fantastic!
Bulgogi tacos, seasoned fries and soy garlic, spicy combo chicken. Drank great beer and enjoyed the football and baseball on the tv’s on the walls.
Service shined with an upbeat and responsive waitress. Didn’t get 5 stars mostly because this is the only time I have been here. Will certainly go again and enjoy this Bonchon<//review>

<Review>The chicken wings were good, bit not for almost $2 a piece. Ordered small 10 pc and dined in, which adds a mandatory 15% service charge. Total was $18. Won't be going there again. Luckily a new wings shop is opening next door. Won't be going here again.</Review>< gmap_id>

I'll start by saying my experience here was 1 star. The Tempe location gives it a bump because the chicken is worth trying. Now, to the San Mateo location, if you're with a pescatarian or Halal friend, this place is a massive mistake and the surrounding competition makes it unworthy of ever revisiting. Service: it was very reactionary-- to the ant that crawled on our table. It was at that point they finally noticed the near empty water and offered to refill it. They offered to replace the dish, which brings me to the second error, food: the entree wasnt worth taking home to finish or to replace. It didnt taste right and was an overall mystery mush. Another factor that didnt help was that there was a football game on and they decided to put the world series of poker on, making it not even worth a place to grab wings and watch sports. Didnt ask them to change the channel because we werent there to watch the game, but all the TVs playing poker seems like a waste. Luckily the gratuity was already on the check so we didnt feel bad for not leaving a tip.< /text>

Not the best.  I got tacos and they were ok, but nothing special.  The price was right at least.  Also, the lady taking our order had a hard time understanding what we were ordering, couldn't answer any questions about the menu and got one of our orders wrong.  Also refused to do a substitution when requested.  Also, the food took forever to come out even though the place was mostly empty.  Would not recommend<//text>

Fried rice with tax and automatic 15% tip was $16.  If it was great I might be ok with that but it was just decent.  A bit bland and chicken was sparse.  Might come back to try wings but price point and lackluster fried rice isn’t compelling.  Service and atmosphere was very good, very clean.<//Text>

Hot, crispy chicken wings! What's not to love? also, they have draft beer (2~3 brands) to go with your wings, which is a necessary. I especially love  bulgogi fried rice, too</Text>

<text>If you're going to have a standard 15% service fee at least have good service, frustrating and sat around waiting for staff to do anything.

Wait for water, wait for the bill, wait for someone to come pick up the bill, wait for change. Spent so much time waiting on employees. I'm happy to pay at the counter just don't make me pay an extra 15%</text>< rating>

Be aware that a "large cocktail" is definitely enough for 2 people, and probably more. Their fried chicken is out of control, and both spicy and soy garlic flavors are delicious. If you want a lighter option, their tacos are also great.</Text>

One of the larger, and cleaner,  bonchons in the Bay. I was surprised that there was no wait on a Saturday night for a party of 5, but maybe it was due to the new chicken place that opened up two doors down. I'm not complaining though...the chicken here always hits the spot.</text>

Good crispy crust almost like caramelized rice crispies. I always get spicy flavor. It is sweet and spicy. Garlic flavor is also delicious. I tried the bi bim bap one time. The bowel was super hot and would not cool down so it ended up taking forever to eat. But it was delicious!<//Review>

Bonchon Chicken is a Korean Style fried chicken spot. They serve Wings (wings and drummets) or Drums. They offer 2 flavors: Spicy or Soy Garlic. You can't go wrong with either flavor. Personally i think the soy garlic is more flavorful, but i prefer spicy because i just like spicy foods. The chicken comes out hot and fresh. The outside has a crisy texture  while the inside is very moist. The service is is very good, they check up on you often and refill my water a couple times without me needing to wave them over.<//review>

I have tried the sesame ginger salad and bibimbap, both with tofu. They are both pretty good and they have a pretty tasty sauce for the bibimbap. I also tried the kimchi pancake, which was a bit over fried and not as tasty as most of the ones I've had at other Korean restaurants.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

Yes chicken is spicy, but that's about it in terms of upside.  Dishes are hastily put together, contain only chicken, what little veggies there were are uncooked</Review>

chain korean fried chicken restaurant locates in san mateo downtown, 2nd ave and B street (former tea river) the fried chicken is legit, crispy skin layer and good texture on meat. You can choose from wings, drums and stripes with garlic soy, spicy or half n half flavor. They have bar area and about 7-8 tables inside, no outdoor seating. They offer lunch special which is good for people working nearby. I visited during their soft opening and it seems this is a must try spot in San Mateo for fried chicken lovers.< /Review>

From out of town and was looking for a quality coffee shop. Found this beauty and was surprised at the attention to detail and quality they put into brewing and serving coffee here. It's a must stop if you're anywhere near Sonora. Super friendly and attentive staff.< /Text>

The best brewed coffee that I've had in Sonora. Plus they sell the excellent Olympia Roasting Company beans.</Review>

Delicious artisan coffee served in a sleek space. Toys for the kids were a hit and scones yummy too. Would love if it were open on Sundays!</Text>

Beautifully remodeled shop with excellent coffee. Friendly and efficient proprietor and a calm atmosphere. Beautifully clean! In-house made bakery items. Finally! A local café that still caters to the locals but doesn’t feel like I’m walking into the movie « Deliverance »😜.<//review>

I am very particular about my coffee and the coffee here is so good! Because of the craftsmanship I love drinks I wouldn't normally order at other coffee shops. Also Troy, the owner knows everything about coffee and he's great to chat with! Try anything, consider sparkling water and espresso too! It will blow your mind. When I am in Sonora, I go here everyday! It should be on every visitors list and a staple for locals.< /text>

If you're looking for sugary frappes, you may want to go somewhere else, but if you want real coffee this is the place. I usually add a little sugar to my lattes and cappuccinos but the expertly steamed milk here is so smooth and creamy I don't even need sugar. The owner is super friendly and the space is modern and clean. I wish I could afford to get coffee here every day!</Text>< pics>

<Review>This is a sweet little gem of a coffee shop. The ambiance is great and the barista really knows how to create a welcoming and friendly environment. I really enjoyed talking to him and the other customers in the dining area while I was there. You don’t get this kind of community at a chain coffee shop.<//Review><user_name>Jeffery Johnson<//user_name>< Rate>

Great coffee from Olympia coffee roasters with a well knowledgeable barista/owner. The coffee I had was a top notch Columbian that had notes of pink bubblegum and berries with a floral aroma 🌈</Review>

Clean. Friendly. Way better than a 🌟 Starbucks. Needs a selection of beans. A barista should recognize that there is no mddle ground in taste.</review>

TLDR: Came for a 3 day tire change and THEY DAMAGED MY CAR with no compensation.

I come with a simple tire change. On the phone, the person helping me assured me that they had a tire in stock and to swing by first thing in the morning to pick up the car. I come after work and they haven't done anything. They order the tire and tell me to come back the next day.
I come back and the tire work was done, but I find my car HAS BEEN DAMAGED. My diver side mirror was broken. I promptly complain to the workers at the front desk and they tell me that the tech who worked on the car was not available and offered no kind of compensation.

For anything besides tire changes don't go here. I needed a simple part replaced and I made an appointment 5 days in advance.

When I showed up that day, they realized they had ordered the wrong part. I didn't complain because accidents happen. They said that they would have the part the next morning by 9am, I called at 8am to confirm this, and they said that our appointment was on for 9am. I gave them an extra hour and showed up at 10 , I got there and they had no clue where the part was or when it was arriving.

Mind you this was a standard OEM part that was in stock. They are not professional and have no regard for other people's time.< /text>

Called on 1/27/21 to book an appointment for 1/30/21 @ 8am.  Showed up to location on day of appointment and the place was closed with a sign on the door saying closed until 2/6/21. Is it too much to expect a business to call you if they need to cancel your appointment and all services for whatever reason? A phone call would have been nice. What a waste of time.</Review>

<Review>I ordered a tire a week in advance and made an appointment to have it installed. When I showed up, they told the shipment was late and I had to wait another 45 minutes which would’ve been okay. They told me to come back in one hour. 2 hours later I came back and they didn’t even start working on the car yet. They could’ve called to update me. No respect for people’s time and I don’t want to keep waiting around especially with the current pandemic.< /Review><Time>1599696841562<//Time>< response>

This has been my go-to car repair shop for over 10 years. They recently moved to this location from San Mateo at El Camino. They have excellent service and friendly staff.  At one point my car light went out and they accepted me right within the hour.

Today my Honda lights all went on. I went in and was helped by Eric. He told me about promotions and discounts they had going on saved me some money. This is the awesome type of service I have come to expect. Love this place.<//Review>

Had a great experience here today; I was a bit nervous before going, after reading some of the reviews, but didn't have much choice as nothing nearby was open on the weekends.

I had a flat tire, and called ahead to ask if I could have my car towed there--the woman on the phone was very helpful and friendly and said to bring it on over, and that they actually have my size tire in stock. In the past at other shops I've had to wait several days because my tire needed to be ordered (Smart car), so that was a nice surprise.

When I got there she was up-front about costs and honest about how long it'd take. I walked home thinking I probably wouldn't have my car back today, but 2 hours later she called to tell me it was ready! Very happy customer, and I'd definitely go back again if necessary.</Text>

<text>Terrible experience!

One week after getting my car checked for $200, my engine overheated in Southern California and had to pay an extra $400 to get it fixed.

They had suggested a few things I needed fixed with my car that would cost around $2k. I decided to not go ahead with those changes and was told my car would still drive fine.

I came back to try and see if they could refund some of the work but they weren't interested whatsoever & blamed it on me not going through with the 2k reparations.

Customer service was also terrible.

<gmapID>0x808f9e7ab60a28cd:0xbef173d35c38032e</gmapID><Review>Called in advance for oil change and tire rotation.  I dropped the car off at 10am, and told them I needed it back by 3pm.  At 330, I walked back and found they were waiting on an oil filter (note: I have a 2018 Chevy, not an exotic vehicle).  "It's on the way" and would be "another 30 minutes".  It's 45 minutes later and still no word from them.

They have my contact info, should have told me it would be later than 3pm.  Should have let me know it also would miss the second 30 minute window, as I was pretty upset and told them to call me.

They are understaffed, and I understand that it would take longer than usual.  But setting these expectations and still missing them is unacceptable.</Review>< Name>

Terrible service.  In the morning, told me they had all needed tires in stock.  Then told me at 1 pm car would be done by the end of the day.  Then at 6 pm, I called for them to tell me they only had three tires.  No one called me.  I was told their inventory does not work properly.</review>

Our experience suggests this business is not trustworthy.  My wife asked them to repair her front right tire which had a slow leak because of a nail.  They called her a few hours later and told her the tire was not repairable (2 nails) and that she would need to buy 2 new tires at $298 each because the vehicle is all-wheel-drive (the difference in tread depth between a new tire and the existing tire was only 2/32").  We declined the work and were charged $30 for their attempted repair and for putting on the spare tire.  As we were driving away I discovered they didn't put the damaged tire back in the vehicle.  I had to go back and ask for it.

The following weekend we went to America's Tire in Redwood City for a second opinion because our experience with Wheel Works didn't feel right.  America's Tire tested the tire Wheel Works had repaired and told us it was fine.  They charged us zero for this service.  They said we didn't need to replace the tire, which incidentally was selling for $99 less at America's Tire.  The automobile dealer's service department also informed me we didn't need 2 new tires because the 2/32" difference in tread depth would not cause a mechanical problem with the car.  Our experience suggests Wheel Works was trying to "churn" business or take advantage of a woman and at the same time trying to keep (and probably resell) the tire that they repaired.

Forgot to mention the America's Tire tech told me the bolt holding the spare tire down inside the vehicle was bent as though someone tried to pull the tire out without realizing they had to first unscrew the bolt.  The only time the spare was ever touched was when Wheel Works removed it for the above repair.  Avoid this Wheel Works location.< /review>

Left my truck there then they call 45 mins later saying they can’t fix screw in tire so I ask them to put on spare they say ok....I go pick it up walking of course it’s not done  They wasted my whole morning!!
I told them I will never go back to which they said good we don’t need customers like you to which I said good because I don’t need horrible work done like you do. They should have examined the tire when I initially brought it in!! Then they also should have told me it was 25 bucks to replace with spare. So I took it to general tire in Redwood City and they’re fixing it with a smile. Do not come here.<//Review>

My husband recommended wheel works, because they work on his car... i went in  July because i had a broken belly plate, they removed it. told me they would order another one, haven't heard from anyone, i have been calling receiving promises that someone would call me back, no one, has called, receiving total run around... its now well in to September and still nothing... i  can't believe how bad their customer service is, just awful.<//review>

Shop around!!

They sales staff are great when you spend and will not serve the customer unless they benefit.

Do your homework, or else they will take advantage.

I have a Subaru AWD vehicle that I needed an emergency tire replaced till the other three (70% tread) were ready to be replaced.

Driving the Subaru (known to be AWD) no one said a thing when 1 tire was requested to be replaced.

I asked to have the tire unmounted so I can take my business elsewhere, because they did have a tire option in stock that I was comfortable with replaceing all 4 tires and they did not call me to give me options before they mounted the tire. The salesman told me he can not unmount the tire,  because the tire is considered used after been mounted on a rim. I felt trapped.

I was a customer for over 20 years.< /Review>

guys there are friendly and responsive, that's where the two stars come from.

But, the skill and knowledge of the engineers/workers in the shop are certainly to be improved.   I send my cars, one year old, to have alignment and balance,   the problem is a bit better but still there.  They said the tire pressure is way to high, almost 10ppi over and lower the pressure.   A couple of days later my cars tire warning light is on and I checked the ti is 6ppi lower than manufacture recommendation!    I lost my confidence in them.

I will try another Wheel Works store in the area.< /Text>

I had with a misunderstanding with an employee  about an oil change and what i wanted. I didnt get what i paid for and i was told that i was wrong and wasnt clear about what i wanted. I was really upset and confused. Jeff had heared about the problem and called me first thing in the morning the next day. He really took time to listen to me and tell me that it should of been handled differently, and even though he called me super early and woke me up he really started my day off to a great start! This company very lucky to have him.< /text>

Took my car in for a wheel alignment. Get a call later on the day, stating an employed had backed another vehicle into mine. Rafel stated he already scheduled to get it repaired at EuroCraft Auto Body. How do I go from getting a wheel alignment to damaging my car?

I'm a returning customer. After this incident, sorry to say, but won't be coming back.< /Text>

<text>Terrible slow service will not be going here again. They told me my oil change would take no more than an hour and a half. It ended up almost taken three hours. As my truck waited outside for 15 minutes I stood at the counter when they continuously answered phone calls and ignoring me like I was invisible.I had to demand the keys for my truck so I could get the hell out of there. The short bald fat guy was unapologetic totally unprofessional. He didn't even do a tire rotation or put the sticker in the windshield.  Wheel works you suck. Go to Jiffy Lube and be done in 20 minutes.<//text><Rate>1< /Rate>< user_id>

<text>I love this park! Its such a wonderful place to take your dogs off leash for exercise and socialization. An hour at the park=lazy dogs all day. This is a great benefit to the city of Redding and well as visitors.  For the most part I have come across very responsible pet owners. A great place to spend the morning or afternoon.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtc0OyABelQPJ1TxyNTsglmY9-TUZINnWHXROV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< user>

My dog loves this place, lots of space for him to run and cool off in the river on those hot Redding days. It would be great if they had a bathroom and a larger parking lot though. The area on the north side of the highway has homeless people living in the bush so I just stay on the south side.< /review>

Absolutely beautiful in spring. The Sacramento river, flowers and doggos. What more could someone searching for beauty in this cruel and unforgiving world ask for? Check it out! The dogs won't judge you if you come without one. They are just happy to see you.</review>

Been there a couple times this week. My dog loves it there. She gets to be off her leash and interact with other dogs. Access to the river if she wants to cool off. There are a few different paths that you can walk and plenty of trash receptacles to clean up after your pet pal. :)< /review>

I find Turtle Bay East to be a superior recreation park. My dogs and I go there as often as we can. The atmosphere feels safe and secure. The length and qualty of the facility are better than any other local park. The efforts made by the City of Redding to maintain and improve it seem to reinforce my opinion. It does seem though we could make use of more parking (not to be critical).</text>

Very nice place to go and take your dog for a walk and too go fishing with friends and family but be careful what you say the same cross ,Stevens are putting spy devices all over the place to spy on people and when I am there they make the most stupid noise i have ever heard in my life i think there last names are beitz tomas beitz Nathan beitz Anthony beitz Richard t beitz willam tomes beitz for from Florida and St Louis so leave my home town and go back to where you came from nut jobs home land  or the F B I needs to do something about this matter as soon as possible get these devices out of my house to do something about this matter as soon as possible sounds crazy to me too but it's sad but true take it or leave it</review>

I love this place. My dog loves this place. She gets to be in her element. Be a dog. Run with her wolf packs, play and swim! But she still has to have manners, respect for people and othe dogs. However there are what appears to be several people living out of
a blue and white van with a few dogs. I don't care so much that they're there everyday, for the last two months, but I'm bothered by the fact they have dogs that have started to take ownership of the dog park! They started out good dogs, friendly dogs. Today, I expierenced the owner of one yell and stomp her feet at my dog as we were approaching my vehicle. All the while yelling at her dog to stay. I kindly told her perhaps she shouldn't bring an aggressive dog to the "off leash dog park." She snapped back, "he's fine as long as no dogs come near him. This is not acceptable to me. I did not call the authorities as nothing had happened, however, I should not fear my dog's health. I will in fact be reporting to Animal Control. I'm not placing any blame on the dog..doesn't matter to me the breed, but the owners must take responsibility. Not the 99% of us that expect cooperation when suggesting they take their dog elsewhere. I'm sorry they're living outta their van. But at 100 + degree weather, this is unfair and inhumane to their dog.< /Review>

<Text>I like it here because it's an off leash area for dogs!
Unfortunately as with almost everywhere in Redding that the river is accessible and there is a fair amount of trees and bushes , there are also illegal, unsavory " campers".
You have to be on high alert and keep your dogs close so they don't find needles,human feces or rotten potentially dangerous food!</Text>< pics>

Lovely park, lots of trails, friendly place to walk your dog. But please clean up after your dog!  Reason for only 4 stars, too much dog poop left by dog owners.< /text>

Great place to bring dogs they are not required to be leashed here. Next to the river so it's cool perfect for a puppy adventure.< /text>

It is a good small family business car repair shop! As a consequence of that, you should not expect to enjoy a luxurious waiting lobby with TV, coffee, and muffins while your car is being fixed, like in a dealership. All these is paid back buy the quality and the price of their service though. They are very customer oriented and try to do their job well at lowest possible price.
They are careful in picking up parts, so that the parts will have a year warranty, which is important, especially if you need to disassemble half of the car to get there. They are very friendy, and once they even fixed a minor scratch on my car for free.
If you want to do some minor car fix, such as oil change, you better arrive earlier, something like 8:50 am or so, as they open at 9 and you will be the first one served. If you want something significant you just leave your car there and take a Bart train from Union City, which is about 10 minutes walking distance.</Review>

Honest people , Fair pricing and good communication !

I got my BMW 328i's brakes replaced and they gave me fair quote (less compared to others) and did a great job. They are patient and explain everything to you. Highly recommended!< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>On Xmas Eve 2018 I arrived into Union City, from Colorado, with a knocking sound emanating from the front end of my 2006 RAM 3500 4x4.  I called Escutia's, based on all the great reviews, and he took me in right away. He immediately diagnosed the problem as a worn-out u-joint on the front axle and ordered OEM quality replacements parts, which he put on the day after Xmas.

That was fantastic service and kept my holidays on schedule and stress-free. They are real craftsman and did very high-quality work, and with a great sense of humor too. His workmanship was outstanding and his price was totally fair, which was impressive given the holiday week.

Highly recommended and I will use them again when in the area.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Review>I have a general phobia of visiting mechanics/dealers based on the reviews because regardless of how good the ratings for dealers are on Google maps they invariably screwed me up.

I came here after a quick chat with Gabe on Yelp. He was helpful and honest and gave me estimates of the costs. I came in here and Frankie helped me with my oil change (very prompt service) and also helped check the brakes. I most certainly will come back here when it's time to service my brakes.

I can fully recommend this place!</Review>< pics>

The guys here are very helpful and know what they are talking about...they want to help you get your car on the road with out the hassle that other shop will do.  Me being a woman some shops will take advantage of that and the men who work here don't do that, they get the job done right and in a timely manor.  I will always come back here and I recommend this shop to everyone.  Thank you for still being human.</text>

<text>I've been working on cars for many decades and it's rare that I need a mechanic. Yet there are some tasks I can't do either because they need very specialized equipment or I'm prohibited by law from doing without certification. I was glad to find a mechanic who is knowledgeable, honest, and affordable. It always bothered me that there are mechanics who do jobs that I know take very little time, yet they manage to charge people exorbitant amounts for labor, and round up to charge for hours that they didn't really work, "preventive" services that are not needed, or parts that don't really need changing.  Escutia charges rates that are very fair. I finally got to the point that I was willing to have a mechanic do things for me out of convenience, such as tune ups, rather than doing it myself since I wasn't being ripped off with high prices.

The flip side is that they have plenty of local business and never needed to advertise, so the place looks like the last place I expected to take my car. It's the site of an old former  two pump gas station with an unprofessionally hand painted sign hanging over it, and is entirely out of character from what you'd expect from a place that gives quality service.<//text>< Date>

<review>We had the best experience this morning. Our waiter Jesus Ochoa was a delight. He was very polite and attentive. He made our experience very pleasurable. The restaurant atmosphere was also a delight. We felt the restaurant has done a great job in making their dining area safe. Highly recommend this Denny’s to anyone.</review>< Pictures>

Food was HOT and the taste was even better. Nothing like HOT food. Our server was friendly and always nearby, although we didn't need her, she was very professional. The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing. This is my third time going to this Denny's with my husband and it's always fun when we do. Thank you Denny's.<//Review>

Restaurant is clean and tidy inside and you have option to dine outside under a tent. Each person dining in has to put their name on the list. Service was quick, our drinks always replenished and food was perfect.< /review>< Pictures>

Was terrible. Was my first time there and my last time.  I was driving for three hours and I want to eat something before going back to LA I went inside sit down got a cup of coffee and after that no body came back to get my order I wait for almost 15 minutes . I was alone . I get up and leave. The place wasn't not even the busy. I was very disappointed.<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I came here to order takeout, and it’s a breakfast restaurant that should be able to make breakfast sandwiches right? I asked for a simple egg & bacon sandwich with regular toast. Could not be done. THE MANAGER is not the brightest, kept saying we can do French toast or we can do sourdough. I just want an egg and bacon sandwich. My experience isn’t like most people I guess because I’m picky for wanting simple food. The place is fine but my easy request could not be fulfilled, it’s frustrating when I went to a Denny’s not less than a week ago and they made me a breakfast sandwich with egg no questions asked. No one ever wants to leave a restaurant hungry especially for breakfast. Go to aunt Emma’s pancakes!! You won’t regret it</Review>< Pics>

Thank You Denney's !
Merry Christmass.  When I got there it was very quiet, just me, and a new waiter. I got my Phillie Steak Omlet hot and juicy. Pancakes hot off the griddle, and the perfect baby pink skinned potatoes. It's very expensive for me now, and it's been "crowded out". It used to be the only restaurant at the 5 freeway exit at The Mile of Cars Way, in National City. But like the rest of San Diego the growth is "pandemic like". The traffic is unreal now, too many government agencies in one BBC spot, and not to mention bv the humungus Paradise Creek Apartments and a brand new "River Park Walkway". Definately a fan,

He fumbles his phone like he just saw a ghost and said, "oh I forgot I'm sorry." I finally get my sugar. Terrible way to lead a his employee's what a bad example. We tipped the waiter for his hard work. So sad to have such an Unprofessional and for lack of a better term lazy manager.< /review>< pics>

Food was ok. The server was super accomodating, though the wait till the food gets to our table took like forever.

Ordered food and items were missing from our order.  Ordered for 3 people. Got one set of plastic ware. All 3 people had to share 1 fork to eat. Worst dennys experience ever after a 12hr long drive I mysteriously got mushrooms in my order. I never ordered  anything with mushrooms. Good thing I didn't die with my mushroom allergy.  Good job dennys. Please clean your grill before throwing on new items too cook..</review>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>I give 2 stars instead of one only because the server started out good, and the food showed up fast and right.

I never did like this dennys location. Common issues were always bad service, bad food prep and lack of ambience. Today was only slightly different. I was seated and it took close to 15 minutes to get a server to stop by. I almost left. Then the server who showed up looked like an off duty server who was helping out. Again...I let it go. She was personable and just a bit chatty. I am chatty too, so I liked that. Food showed up fast. Eggs were right and the server was professional. There.. that covers 5 stars. Now the deductions down to 2 stars.

As soon as she completed my order she went on break. No problem, other servers will watch for me. Yeah, right.

I finished my coffee, put the cup on the edge of table for a refill. This is a common signal for a refill. I've travelled around the country and overseas...this really is a signal. Servers walked past my table a half dozen times and ignored it. I had to ask a busser to refill my coffee. No one came through to check on me. Maybe I wanted a slice of purple or something.

I dont know why this location is so bad. I can go to the one in mission valley or la mesa and have good service. But here... I can bet money that it will be bad. I dont get it.

As for the stellar reviews ... I just listened to a report on NPR about a website where you can trade or buy positive reviews for you business. I guess dennys invests in that service.</review>< Pictures>

<review>My experience with the Denny's restaurants had always been pleasant. However, this locations did not meet what I always look in restaurants. First it took them some time to take our order, the server was not very friendly, and the food also took some time. I ordered the 3 leches pancakes and it did not had any milk on them, she also did´t ask if I wanted more coffee, until she knew I was leaving. Sorry but I have experience better.<//review><userid>104433430974396793346<//userid><name>La Señora De Musa<//name><response>None<//response><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80d9526b9fd4270f:0xae8509d7d1583403<//GmapID>< rate>

<Review>We like Denny's a lot and the skillets are possibly the tastiest dishes on the menu. This particular visit was a little disappointing because my Santa Fe skillet was light. There was more space around the edges than usual. Delicious but skimpy.<//Review>< time>

Great place to go early in the morning. Hardly anyone here and the service is pretty quick. Great food with great service. I would recommend anyone to go in early to eat at this Denny's restaurant for good quality service.<//Review>

Cup of chicken noodle soup was good but a bit salty. Had philly steak sandwich with seasoned fries. Hubby had chicken with gravy, cranberry sauce & toasted bread slice. Couldn't finish it but asked for containers. Helpful waitresses!<//Review>

Food is always good here but this visit was kind of a downer. Waiter was attentive and kept our coffee filled, food came out in a timely manner.  When we walked in there was no one to seat us we had to wait for at least 5 minutes to be told someone would help us, the register was backed up. When they clean tables they use a cart but when it is parked next to your table while you are eating that is disgusting< /Text>

<Review>I understand that it was a holiday but when I ordered a second plate of food they forgot about me and my girlfriend. Then when we asked what happened they gave us a attitude. To top it off when we noticed a female employee putting makeup on in the food countertops they didn't do anything about it. All they said was that the manager was going to come speak with us but they did. I'm still trying to figure out how to report them to the food and safety board.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80d9526b9fd4270f:0xae8509d7d1583403</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was sick and in bed so I decided to order some food they forgot a couple of things and then when I called I couldn't get through to anyone it was a bit frustrating. By the time my food order was correct half of it was cold and half of it was wrong but the manager did make it right and apologized I guess that's something.</text>

Actually, my son and I had a great experience. Thanksgiving dinner plans fell through so we drove to our local Denny's because most anything else was closed. Our service was very good and the food was much better than I expected on this holiday night. The turkey was delicious and the Oreo (trademark!) shake and pecan pie were the best I've ever had (sorry, grandma, but your pie is still the best homemade I've ever tasted😀). Thank you for a wonderful experience, Denny's Natl. City!
We'll be back!!! Dada and Jordan Hicks< /text>

<text>I visited Denny's for a lite breakfast before hitting the gym. Pancakes were great. Turkey bacon was good. The eggs though.... I am pretty sure they were powdered or some kind of artificial substance. So I finished up my flapjacks and as I left I thanked a serviceman (his patch read 'Carter') who I noticed had prayed for his meal. As I paid for my ticket, I felt compelled to pay it forward so I bought his breakfast too. I hope they thanked him again, for me. No pix of the $4 breakfast slam.</text>< Pics>

Denny's is indeed a good place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner because of the Variety of foods they have in there, a really good place if you don't feel like fast foods< /Review>

You can always count on the food being consistent. Everyday slam for $4 how can you beat that. The staff is always great to work with. Michael the manager always on top of things. I usually get served by Tammara and or Evelyn always remember my Mo for ordering. Thanks everyone< /Text>

<Review>When I was a kid High School Denny's couldn't boil water. Literally their hot tea was terrible. What a turnaround. I'm particular about what I eat. Denny's has become a very consistent with a big menu I've never had anything here that I don't like anymore. Well run management, and a great group of kids working the tables. Talk about value, the morning slam two fluffy pancakes two bacon or sausage two eggs 4 bucks, are you kidding me !  You can't beat it. Their pot roast, fish dinners, like I said big big menu. You can't go wrong here . Thank you all</Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< UserId.>

Excellent service. We had a waiter named Robert who was soooooooo nice helpful and patient with us. Only complaints would be they had lots of tables uncleaned. And my plate was a little dirty when I received it. Also they had liquid spilled on many parts of the floor. But the customer service is spot on.< /text>

Denny's is truly America's Diner I arrive at 11 early for lunch the server was knowledgeable, and the food advice quickly and hot. The lunch crowd start coming in about noon, by that time I was done and out the door. The place was clean and the staff were very friendly and cheerful summer and I do recommend this place for a quick bite, for big groups who are on budget, so if you're looking for a true diner food and Diner experience this is the place to go< /Review>

We are in love with Dennys. You just can't get a Dennys burger in Australia. My first time to the USA was when i was 17 and i loved them then. Was glad to see it was just as good as it was 30 yrs ago</review>

< Review>
This place is always great. Especially for the area of town. It is always busy here so you guys will want to show up during off peak times to enjoy yourselves. Mind the road, as it gets busy with the school students at In and Out. The lines can get pretty long, but that is because the service is amazing at Denney's. The hosts a hostess'  are always smiling. The cooks deliver fresh food within 15 minutes of ordering, which is impressive for a place so busy. The food is perfectly prepared with a sense of pride and professionalism. Whatever they are doing, they should keep at it!< /Review>

<Text>Last time I eat at this location! I ordered buffalo strips and 10 mins after they come back with a sorry we don't have the buffalo sauce 👎🏻Also I asked for strawberry lemonade and waitress comes back again and says none available if I can take a soda instead 🤦🏻‍♀️. 45 mins pass, Then when manager comes to apologize she finally came over with buffalo strips. Waitress asks manager for discount for my wait and troubles ..... yeah she said no and didn't show up again! Even though she saw me at the register and made a U turn towards kitchen to avoid me completely. I would not have asked for a discount if waitress would not have mentioned it.

It was Sunday morning and very full but we were seated in about 5 minuets with a party of 8. The waiter was great. He was kind and listened to my child's order and even made a big deal when he brought out his drink in the souvenir Millennium Falcon cup. This made my son's day. Our orders were all correct, food was great and coffee cup kept full. All in all a great eating experience. Which is few and far between with and 8 year old and an 11 month old. Great job Denny's!</Text>

<Text>Food was good although service was not in a timely manner. We went to breakfast before we catched a flight so were there early when there was 1 or 2 waitresses. Took 15 min to get our hot coco and it was cold. Silver ware was all brought last min. Overall food was good.<//Text>< Rating>

The police open 24 hours the wait staff are very relaxed easy-going and helpful. Sometimes I come in here for the bike at 3 in the morning and it is a blessing to find a place open 24 hours. The food is good the service. Nothing exceptional but it's always good, and that's what you expect from a Diner.</text>

Ordered a breakfast skillet and the portion on the potatoes and veggies was very skimpy. I didn't leave full. Iced tea tasted like coffee. A lot of places allow you to get pancakes instead of toast for no additional charge but apparently Denny's doesn't. Employees were friendly though.</Review>

They have some challenges with service but it is getting better. Couldn't figure out with as crowded as it was why there wasn't a rover just pouring coffee and found out she was on break... Hmm. Interesting! Update.... 3rd time back and the service keeps getting better.<//Review>

<text>We love coming to this dennys. But today had to be the worst experience ever. The waiter took our order then went on his lunch break. Just left us waiting. Never came back to check on us, see if we needed more coffee, sugar.. etc.. we had to ask other waiters for stuff. We never seen him again. Then they started bringing us cold coffee, warm orange juice, my order was incorrect.. the list goes on and on with this place today<//text>< pictures>

<rate>1</rate><Text>They sat us down about 10:25pm. The servers never came to our table to even place an order for drinks and the place was pretty empty only 3 other groups and 2 waiters on the clock. We raised our hands for their attention and they all were just huddled at the register gossiping. The girl saw us and just laughed. Never bothered to attend to us. what horrible service. We left at almost 1045pm and they just laughed as we left.

We should have known they werent taking the night seriously as a bunch of tables still had their dirty dishes on them. Was the bus boy goofing off as well?

You work for the tips kids. Nice to know you won't be getting any from us. Horrible service and rude group of employees. Bye Felicia's.

We ended up going to the Dennys in chula vista which had 5 star service. Better group of workers there unlike the wild little rats at this location.<//Text>< pics>

French toast was kinda hard but good. Sunny side eggs were great, as was the bacon. Hashbrowns tasted like hashbrowns. Had a vanilla milkshake and it was quite enjoyable. Tables where clean and the chairs where comfy. Pancake with marinera sauce was bad(but that was just my own mistake). Good customer service and good overall experience.<//review>

<review>Well, it's Denny's. So this location is fairly predictable in that sense. Denny's food served by Denny's servers in a Denny's amount of time for a Denny's price.

Let’s just start things off with No host to sit us down. Took about 5 min for them to notice us. We went to our table. The table was dirty with filthy seats!
We waited about 15 min for our server to arrive and we didn’t not receive a welcoming or his name . As he got to our table all he said was “what do you guys want”.
We proceeded to order. Our drinks did not arrive for another 15 min! No silverware was handed to us. A different sever dropped off our drinks and spilled my drink on the table.. I asked for a napkin. He was angry about me asking for napkins. He came back and just tossed them on our table.. our food took about another 20 mins to arrive.. as my wife was about to take a bite on her burger she noticed a nasty looking hair stuck on the cheese !
We waited about an hour for everything! Terrible service! Please avoid this place !
Very rude servers ! I mentioned it to the host since the server was no where to be found . She mentioned to us that we can get new food .. but we just decided to leave.. she apologized for the bad service .<//text>

Quintessential all American staple. It's really hard to beat chicken fried steak and eggs for a treat every now and again.

Quality of food and service has gone down drastically lately, watered down orange juice, tastes more like bad water, even sunny d tates good compared to their OJ, had to wait easily 20  minutes before I was offered any drinks, food portions look more like kids meals now, I would not mind higher prices for better service and food. Will have to look elsewhere for breakfast from now on.<//Text>

Always come to this one cause compared to others, the service is a lot better. I give them two thumbs up for a great costumer service. They do sometimes have their downs, for example, sometimes they don't pay attention to the front. Aside from being dangerous, it makes the costumer wait longer than they should and confused lol.
Over all though, I would still choose this Danny's. 😉</review>

THE BEST Dennys dining experience we've had; despite it being a little busy time, waiter Enrique was excellent, Manager Rafael has a VERY great team, very courteous & organized, professional to say the least, right from the start, with the hostess to the end of our visit, the cashier. BIG THANK YOU!</text>

<text>I don't normally give Dennys 5 stars but this time seemed like the exception it was geared more towards the wait staff as the young male waiter I had was very courteous and came back about every 5 minutes to check my coffee and see how I was doing, that's a big thing for me. So I gave a 70% tip. It's also Christmas  and sucks that they have to work. Thanks Dennys< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

He got our order slightly wrong. He name was brandon. We then waited 30 mins for our food which was cold and then we had asked for dessert. Waited 20 mins and nothing so we asked for our food to go to get told that one of the items we had asked wasn't available anymore. Very disappointing.</review>< Rate>

They were short of staff I guess, my server Jose was the only one helping in a big area of the restaurant. Had to wait a lot to get my order and when I finished waited more than 15 minutes just to get my check.</text>

<Review>Your typical Denny's diner. We usually go with 5 to 7 people and are always seated within 10 minutes. They turn tables pretty quickly and there is plenty of room in the restaurant. Once you're seated, your service depends on how busy it is. Majority of time they are quick and efficient. One server used to remember all 7 orders to a T. I dont think she's there anymore. Thwre are times that service is inadequate. Not necessarily bad just kind of forgetful and quite entertaining. You'll start getting food you didn't order, sodas arriving when you still have one. An extra coffee. Like they are so scared of being slower that they start sending stuff early-just sending things to everyone. Otherwise food is a decent diner meal and the price isn't something to complain about.<//Review>< Pictures>

Just went in early this morning for breakfast. Took to long to be seated. Place wasn't even half full. Took just as long for order to be placed. Usually they bring your beverage, coffee in this case, after taking order. Didn't happen like that. When I finally got coffee and food, eggs overcooked. No coming back to see if all was well. No apologies for slow and sorry service.  Won't be back anytime soon.</Review>

The service definitely varies but its Dennys. I dont come here looking for the greatest service. Its a good location right off the 5 freeway in National City. The restaurant is usually kept clean and would recommend this location.< /text>

The wait time in this place on weekends its long. The staff tends to forget to check in on the patrons, if they need anything while they wait for their food. The other problem is the wait time after you order your food. It used to be different before the renovations, the wait time was the same but the staff was more courteous and checked on the costumers and notified them of any delays.</Text>

Will never go back to this Denny's. Server was RUDE. Food was wrong twice(&I don't usually send food back). This is usually a very busy location ,so the management should know to better staff this location. I've been going to this Denny's for at least ten years.Its gotten progressively worse,now to the point that I will NEVER return<//Text>

Honestly, this place was fair service, but horrible layout. creates many issues when trying to use the facilities.  The facilities are very limited which created a line due to the single commode.  Also there was a pretty big  line of people attempting to get inside which seemed to be caused by understaffed issues rather than actual seating availability.<//text>

Terrible service...  No one came to our table for 10 minutes.  Had to hunt down a wait person.  Pancakes came out half way through breakfast.  Impossible to get coffee refilled without hunting down the wait person again.  Cashier was rude acting as if we were there to serve her.</review>

I ordered blueberry pancakes and all the vlue berries are in the center and its just gross. Only go here on emerency now because the otjer cooks are terrible.  Idk what the guys name that is really cool and always gets my stuff good to go but the other guys need to learn from him because they suck.</Text>< Pics>

Server was a bit slow.   And I just didn't like my omelette.  I don't recall what I ordered but I  wished I had just ordered cheese and onions.  Hash browns were not bad.</review>

She kept cutting us off in the middle of trying to order or say something. My order was wrong and when she brought my fries out, they were cold and old. She was friendly with other tables and talking to them, but walking right past our table and we kept catching her peek around the corner and go talk with coworkers instead of help us and the few times she did come to the table she was unfriendly and plain rude. Will not be coming back here again.</Text><GmapID>0x80d9526b9fd4270f:0xae8509d7d1583403<//GmapID>< user_id>

The food at this Denny's was really good and the waitress was awesome everything was cooked perfectly the French toast and pancakes were really good they have the $2,$4,$6 and $8 deals and for only $4 I got pancakes 2 eggs 2 pieces of bacon and got blueberries in my pancakes and it was delicious they also have a French toast slam for $8 and you get alot of food it's well worth it<//Text>

I had a horrible experience. They messed up my order twice. The first time I got my food, I asked the cashier to put cheese on my burger and fries and they didn't do that and I asked for grilled onions rather than raw, the messed up on that as well. When i gave them the food to remake I over heard one of the girls talking mess saying "she only wanted the cheese on her fires" pretty much calling me a liar, which is unprofessional and she wasn't telling the truth  because she wasn't even there when I placed my order! second time they claimed to "remake" my order, they added the grilled onions and LEFT THE SAME RAW ONIONS ON THE BURGER! They didnt even bother the at least make it seem like they "remade the burger". Not only that, the veggie pattie was falling apart when they gave it to me. They had me waiting there for 10 mins telling me that they was "remaking" my food and they NEVER remade it! On top of that my other food was getting cold! The cashier and the other people that work there wasn't really friendly either. Never again will I go to this location<//review>

After a couple of minutes she came back with some of the orders with a very dirty cup which I ordered hot chocolate and looking really untidy so I told to my husband that he will ask another cup so that  I can transfer the hot chocolate into the clean one so instead of waiting to the person who took our orders my husband asked one of the server who are not that busy but she said I will tell to your server then we waited and waited until I noticed that my hot chocolate was already cold to drink so I decided to cancel our orders instead of getting mad we left . The thing was instead of helping each other (serves ) and whoever has the chance to meet the costumers needs they should help or assist them with respect even it is not the table they are serving. Hopefully the Manager of 5:30pm Friday Nov.4th could see what's going on and should circulate around just to be sure costumers are given the right assistance. Now we don't know if we will be looking forward to go back to this place or no more . I am giving this place a Zero rating..<//review>< Pics>

Terrible service!! Stranded at counter to be seated for 10 min then when I went to look for a server she gave me attitude. She took us to a table then  waited another long time for server. Didn't want to wait anymore so I left. Terrible service!</text>

Poor service at 5 am. No cutlery available,  waitress forgot to give us napkins, and the coffe mugs were dirty. Yes they were dirty. Had lipstic markins on the rim. Tammy offered no apologiesnfor the dirty mugs and forgot to come around and ask if we needed anything else.<//Text>

<Text>We went dine in last night, and this is the second time in a row that we had bad experiences anyways, the server brought my coffee really cold and it took him 20 mins to switched, I ordered a club sandwich and I got a turkey one, he never came to check up on us or either offer refills.</Text>< Rate>

This Dennys had the worst service ever. The place was lonely and the waiters looked at us several times and never came  to take our order. Dont come to this place...youll regret it! Go to the in n out across the street instead:)<//Review>

It was awful, just had breakfast took forever to seat 5 people and people that got there after us were seated faster not to mention they had 6 or 7 people in their party. When we got seated the waitress decided to split us up into 2 tables. WHY DO YOU THINK THATS OKAY? We come here to have breakfast TOGETHER. I understand theres a lot of people but really? Dont sit us like that. Food is great, Im not going to judge the waitresses as a whole but this was a bad experience<//Text>

Myself and a Friend got seated yesterday at Denny's off 24st we just came up to us to take her order but we weren't ready needed more time well that waitress never came back to us 25 minutes later we got up and walked out told the manager that we were not waited on and we had already had coffee and we wanted to pay for it and they give us a coffee on the house and coupons I won't be going back to eat there any more<//Review>

Had terrible service from Stephanie and Kelsey on 1/28/17. Our table was neglected during service, and when we mentioned it to the manager we received a $2 discount and a coupon for our next visit. Will never return to this location again.<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Excellent customer service. Friendliness, service and good taste of the ordered dish.
And the most important thing for me is that they are not pressuring you over time to vacate the space. Yes, I would return to that same place.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Very bad attention, there were no people and it took us 1 hour waiting at the table, I asked them if it would take long for the manager and he said that the food was almost ready and after that the waiter told us that in case we went to complain about that the order was not done and we didn't say anything and he said the same thing to us again. I think it is not our fault that they have very few employees and on the part of the manager it was not even to apologize to us there is a problem he only suggested that if we wanted to leave it was fine. Too bad for them

(Original)
Muy mala atención no avía gente y nos tardaron 1 hora esperando en la mesa les pregunte si tardaría mucho al encargado y dijo que no que ya casi estaba lista la comida y después de eso fue el mesero a decirnos que si acaso nos fuimos a quejar de que la orden no estaba hecha y nosotras no dijimos nada y el nos volvió a decir lo mismo. Yo creo que nosotros no tenemos la culpa de que tengan muy pocos empleados y por parte del encargado ni siquiera fue para decirnos una disculpa hay un problema solo nos sugirió que si queríamos irnos que estaba bien.
