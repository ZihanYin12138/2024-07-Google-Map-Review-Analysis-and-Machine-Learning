<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I came in for a blonde ombre and got a patchy balayage instead. I was there 4.5 hours and could tell that she was rushing through the whole thing, especially at the end. Some of it is white, some is purple, some is brassy. I saw it at the end and thought maybe I could like it even if it isnt what I wanted but this is just......bad.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLHltfaOCEOdniJennXaI_w7VhbSe3c2fX6qLe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFERvO_gFaCKocbRXWvtQQkp4oG3oPFpOBpEmf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGZNC4BjmLZuzMkG1AAPqLcMGSghiqo-cHAIkK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3rbIhqTq74dB6uJix1luyKaJVtIb2SdRyN2Ta=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF_8tMjMXJWqYXKTTDJV28ejJW_87xdfKi_v18=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBeKBfvugZyy3e8yR_BjB36-icLLtpvN6UDIvG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809ade1ada1e68bf:0x4208aea86513e04b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Brittany, the stylist did my hair. I totally appreciate her patience and also being thorough with a complicated tedious color job. She did such an amazing job! I highly recommend, they are courteous, friendly and so much fun!< /Review>< pics>

Paris is a good stylist for the curly haired people. My husband looks amazing with layers of curls that are shaped naturally to the way nature.<//review>

This is my second visit...both times nothing less then perfection!! 3 months post op from brain surgery, they fixed my hair from the surgeons shave and managed to cover my scar completely.....a year and a half later (today) I got a perm, never having had one before I wasn't sure what to expect, my hair was frizzy, long and stringy, Thanks to Linda she literally changed all that....I now have healthy full looking hair with pretty curls along with a cut to blend in with the new growth from the surgery.. I knew the result wouldn't be any worse than when I came in, but I didn't expect this I liked it when I left...It wasn't until I got home and the perm had fully taken form did I fall in love!!! I feel like a new woman.. .Thank you Linda you are a beautifully crafted woman, amazing service and all around person!< /Text>

I had a haircut from Kayla, who was not only very friendly but very knowledgable. She helped me pic between two different haircuts and talked me through her thought process for each. I really appreciated that this salon follows COVID guidelines and the atmosphere was very warm and clean. I would love to come back.< /text>

(My opinion,  I think other reviews im sure are probably workers or offered a discount for their review) Beware !!! Of Owner/Manager..... I got my hair done SPECIFALLY said I wanted the back of my head done and beautician stated she understood..... Got home lifted up my hair into a pony tail and my hair was brown and not done.So I called the beauty shop and told them what happened and needed to make an appointment to come back in to have it fixed.. She said ok and booked my appointment for a partial she stated. I clarified and told her no its a fix. She said ok. I called back again 4 days later to verify my appointment. She said yes I have you down for a partial.... I said no its a fix. She says ok. I come in for my appointment today, get my hair corrected and get to the front to ask if I can leave a tip for my beautician because I wanted to leave her something regardless of the mistake. The girl in the front says that will be $70.00. I told her no .... This was a fix because my hair was not done right the 1st time. Owner comes around the corner and says what's the problem. I explained everything..... He states its $70.00 as though he cared a less about the mistake. I told him no! That's not right and its wrong to charge me something that should have been done right the 1st time. He says..... I cant verify who you told that to.....Let me do this then..... Ill charge you 50% ...... Lol .... REALLY ?????? Wow...... I told him... Here.....ill give you your measly 35.00 but im never coming back here and had ALREADY referred my 2 daughters to come here and I just texted them both NOT to anymore because in my opinion the owner of this place is VERY unprofessional in customer service.</Text>

Ana cut my hair and was great! She gave me a good confidence boost before giving me curtain bangs, which I adore. I genuinely am not great with my own hair, and I know I have asked stylists in the past for advice on what would fit my face but I feel like I never get much out of them. She gave me good advice for my hair type as well. I'm not great at getting trims regularly, but I'm going to actually try and I will ask for her when I return:) thanks Ana!</Review>

Just wanted to give my hair stylist, Ana, a shout out for always taking great care of me and my hair! I've been seeing her for over a year now and couldn't be happier with the results I get. I've never loved my hair more! She is the sweetest and I always look forward to my appointments! Would recommend her 110%!< /review>

Everyone at Textures is friendly and warm. But I go here to see Anna. I’ve been a loyal client of hers for over a year. From day one she made me feel comfortable and like we were old friends. She’s very attentive, personable and most importantly she’s consistent! I’ve never left unhappy and she knows that as soon as Ive tried a new style or look I will be ready for a change by the next appointment. Whether it’s new bangs, going with an A-line shape or dying it maroon I always get so many compliments. Highly recommend everyone but definitely Anna!<//review>

I had a Groupon for a deep conditioning, style and cut. Summer did me hair she did a great job! My hair is super dry and frizzy and she made it pretty and shiny again, she also blended my layers. Looks a thousand times better!
She also didn't pressure me into buying a bunch of products which I hate when hair dresser do that. So I'm very happy and even though this is pretty far from my house I will be back!< /text>

<name>Daniella Stepek</name><review>It was my first time to Textures last week. I was running late for my consultation but I called and they said it was okay that I come half an hour later! That helped my out a lot and they were so kind for doing so! Then today I had my actual appointment for balayage. My stylist was Shannon and she was very sweet and talented. I’m absolutely in love with my hair!! It turned out better than I expected. Visiting Textures has been a wonderful experience and I’ll come again. Also, I’ve never left a review ever before but they were so good that I felt I needed to. Thanks again Textures!</review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Have been going here about 1  1/2 years Hazy is great, I get a perm twice a year and haircuts with her. I wear my hair as Hazy and I call it easy, wash and wear hair.

It's a true pleasure to have my hair cut at Textures.  It has lovely decor with super friendly staff and very talented hair stylists.  I cannot rave enough about Jeralene.  She's fantastic and does an incredible job with my thin hair. She created a"do" on me that I never would have tried.  It is beautiful and very flattering.  I trust her entirely. I highly recommend this salon as Top Rated and a go-to place for hair.</Text>

Sierra did exactly what I wanted,  I had a wedding to attend and they got me in the same day that I emailed. Was impressed with the quick reply. Seems a fun and laid back place.</Review>

It was absolutely wonderful going to Textures salon! The staff were all very sociable and friendly, and you get to read fun little magazines while you're waiting for your hair to condition and dry. My hair turned out amazingly once it was all done. I will definitely be returning to this place once I need another cut!< /text>

<user_name>Priscila Luna</user_name><Text>I started telling them what I wanted on my hair and ended up getting whatever they could do... which showed me how much “experience” they have... sucks paying that amount of money to get your hair ruined. Literally. People call me now crappy hair. I’m definitely not going back to this place. EVER. 👎< /Text>< time>

My Stylist had no hesitation when I told her what I needed!!! I have a Betty Page Bangs style and had recently been duped by a salon claiming to know how this cut is done... My stylist not only knew exactly what to do? But she also repaired the mistake they had made and hid it so that it could grow out beautifully without my having to style to hide it everyday!!!!! Brilliant!!! A +< /review>

I tried Textures Salon last year while searching for a new hair stylist.  I found Hazi and just love her!  And what a beautiful experience in the salon-they just expanded and it is so comfortable and welcoming you will love it!</Review>

I'd been searching for a new hairdresser and decided to give Textures a try.  My hairstylist, Hazi, did an amazing cut and color and the best part was, it didn't break the bank!  I've book a second appointment for late next month.  I will definitely be going back.</text>

so I thought that this salon was an extension of Hoshalls in Folsom and that is why I tried to get my hair done there. I have been going to Hoshalls for over 10 years and have never had a bad experience. THIS IS NOT HOSHALLS! IT IS SOME FAKE. my first experience here was walking in at 10 am with my child who was sick and stayed home from school. I was told children are not allowed in the salon and they could not do my hair. they also said it loud enough that my kid heard and is now blaming herself for my not getting a cut. this has NEVER happened to me before. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.</text>

I used a Groupon to first try out this Salon.  I chose Chelsea based on some yelp reviews and  I really couldn't be happier.  I am now going back time and again and I am grateful to her for listening to exactly what I wanted.< /Text>

Jeralyn saved me from an atrocious cut by another salon hairdresser.  My mid back long hair was whacked and chopped by MJ that I was so humiliated to be out in public.  My hair was sporadically chopped to 2 inches in some areas and the ends were crudely cut straight across and lopsided.  Jeralyn was able to reshape it into a very pleasing style that everyone who knew me (with my long hair) now commented on what a great short cut I now wore.  Jeralyn is truly a great stylist/hairdresser!</Text>

<Text>I started with purchasing a Groupon and now I have no problem paying full price for Hazi to cut, color, and highlight my hair.  Everything from their text reminders of appointments, friendly front receptionist, salon hours that fit my busy schedule, no pressure sales, and great conversations, is why Textures Salon by Bryan Hosall is why I drive from downtown Sac to their location!!< /Text><date>1452219644260<//date><rating>5<//rating><userid>113784647429036658692</userid><response>None<//response><name>Lisa Esquivel</name><gmap_id>0x809ade1ada1e68bf:0x4208aea86513e04b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Stopped by here today and I am not sure if the person worked there? Or was a client! Just stared at me and then keep playing on his phone. No good customer service. I left and found a better tire shop in the area.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>They came as a recommendation from a family member and I drove the extra distance (I live in San Pedro).   I got a great deal on tires and brakes.  But more importantly, I felt that I was sincerely being taken care of.   Israel is a top notch guy and I feel he has the customer's best interest in mind.

I waited for a bit as I had my brakes replaced and I watched several customers come and go (mainly for tire replacements) with smiles on their faces.     I would definitely use them again.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b6f04f2c27af:0x5a029ea00ff75f3e< /gmap_id></record>

AMAZING. I have a Lexus IS250, I went to some of the bigger tire places before this and they either quoted crazy prices or didn’t have the tires I needed! the guys here were so nice and got me in an out in MAYBE 30 minutes. Prices are unbeatable!! Trust me if you need new tires, this is the place!</text>

<review>got serviced 1/18/2019.. service was fast and friendly.. had a parasitic flat tire, they had a used tire in good condition available and swapped/balanced it for cheap. Got me good to go in less than 15 minutes! Only problem was they mounted a directional tire in the opposite direction, so now my car pulls to the right.</review>< user_name>

<text>I went here on a Sunday morning because they were nearby and actually open. Finding someone at the garage was a little odd, but once he saw me and attended to me, it was fast! I had a bolt in my tire. He said he could remove the bolt and patch the tire. He jacked my truck up, took off my tire, rolled it into the shop, and 5 minutes later, he was putting it back on my truck. It cost all of $10. I'll definitely come to this place with my next tire needs.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Customer service was outstanding. The gentleman does know the meaning of service. Needed new tires asap. He was helpful and they were fast. Prices were very reasonable. I would definitely come back.  Highly recommend this tire shop.</Text>

<Review>Sam's Discount Tire was great! Super low prices for both used and new tires (I got one of each) and I did have some issues but when I went back, they were eager to fix the issues and make it right without charging me extra. I'll definitely be back for any future tire needs.<//Review><username>Sara Prado</username>< rating>

I've gotten tires from this Sam's Discount Tires twice. I had a really wore tire that needed to be replaced, I Googled near by places and saw this place had 5 stars so I decided to give it a try.
A male customer getting his car serviced told me that he has been going there for years so I decided to get a tire.
I came a second time because I needed another tire. The guys are fast, and affordable.  I had to come a 3rd time, 2 weeks later because I got a nail in my tire. The service man George remembered me and helped me right away. I appreciate him remembering me, helping me and thanks to all the staff that has  me.<//review>

Popped a run flat and drove 1 mile to Sams given these reviews. Jorge was awesome ... in/out in 20 min w used but same tire ... at a very reasonable price. Customer Service was beyond expectation from the moment we drove in. Highly recommend Sams!! Jack fr NYC</text>

<Text>Terrible experience with staff, not knowledgeable and Manager is not on duty. When asked they say- it’s the store Manager it’s upto her on when she takes off. Not willing to help and they were giving us suggestions like sell online or gift someone if you don’t like it.

We had tags/ everything was brand new condition. We just didn’t have receipts with those items. And I also have an account and other receipts from that days , she said we’ve got new systems and we can’t do anything.. this is how This Company works.. we are different.

Terrible store.. stay away!< /Text><rate>1<//rate><userid>112363104883732439126< /userid><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

It was placed in a discount area, and when the older Vietnamese lady working at the front rung it up the price was off, she then said it belonged in a different shelf with a bigger discount (discount are price was lower than the quoted price), she agreed to give us the discounted price (from the area she said it was from) then didn't do it even when we asked. We bought it, then returned it because it was cheaper online (store doesn't match Wilson online prices). Ordered it online, but the order was canceled by Wilson's because the item was no  longer available.  Waste of time and effort.<//review>< user_id>

This is a nice store with excellent collection of genuine leather and artificial leather products ranging from $50 to few thousand I guess. The only negative thing about this store is their Manager Engie. She is very rude in her behavior and doesn’t care to comply with the after sales service or return policy of the store that is written on the receipt.</text>

Always been a good place to shop leather stuff, I got my 1st leather jacket from Wilson's leather in 2011 and it still going well. Prices are very resonable, and many times there is sale, when you get good deals. Definitely will recommend a visit if you are in the mall.</Review>

Absolutely ridiculous customer service! I have been to this store a couple of times but my last visit was beyond horrid! I was sold a defective overcoat (worth $80) which keeps shedding feathers like crazy. As is expected, I’d taken the price-tag off before starting to wear the overcoat. However, after a few uses, I realized that the coat was horribly spoiling my clothes underneath. I went back to Wilson’s with the product INVOICE within the first two weeks from its date of purchase. However, the Store Manager refused to take back the garment because I'd taken the price-tag off the coat! Now if you’re reasonable and reading this review, would you have suggested that I wear my coat with the price tag hanging out?? I’m appalled that a store which houses such reputed brands can be so careless and so unhelpful towards their customers!! Instead of being sympathetic, the Store Manager with ease palmed off her responsibility and put the onus on me.  Honestly, stay away from this store because unlike any other store in Great Mall, these guys are pathetic in their after-sales assistance!</text>

We came looking for one leather jacket and ended buying 5. This store was great and the staff(Dusty) was great with her recommendations and getting us the best deals. Can definitely recommend Wilson's Leather based on our experience here today.</Text>

<review>Horrible experience. Manager at this store is extremely rude and has no sense of customer relationship. Got a 200$ bag few months back and stitching has already ripped off. Store manager won't listen to the reason and she hung up in the middle of conversation saying "we won't accept the return and that's my final decision".
Tip to Wilson's leather: Have a representative who knows how to represent the store and it's brand and not a horrific person like her who acts like a tyrant.<//review>< response>

I have had multiple bad experiences at the great mall store and also with customer care. The staff working at the store have the no understanding on returns, I stood for 40 mins to explain my online order returns. It was a 5 mins job. She kept saying , why dont you return through mail. Can she really question the customer for their visit to the store?. They are always short on staff at the store and they are less informed about the products. The customer care online cannot understand anything that we explain. I called 3-4 times for a price match. They said its initiated, but I never got any credit. I sent my online orders back, its been 2 weeks and I have no update on it.< /Review>

Customer service zero. The 800 number they provide do not give more than 2 options and then hang up. The direct number of the store doesn't work or nobody answers. Good start.< /review>

i had the worst shopping experience at Great Mall Wilsons Leather outlet Center, i had purchased an office bag for my wife but since the size was not a good fit , we decided to return it. The sales person at Wilsons leather outlet was not only unprofessional but also rude. they will just not let you return , they tried to find some reason not to return , but since we had all receipts and tags intact, the salesperson even had the nerves of saying that the outlet you purchased the bag from does not even exist, for a minute I could not believe that they could stoop so low. Finally when the sales person did find the store from where i made the purchase she went on to make a rude comment of " why do you purchase an expensive bag when you want to return it " . That was it for me, I will never ever even visit the store again let alone buying from them. Zero stars on customer service. I would highly discourage anyone from going to Wilson's leather.<//Review>

Horrible store ever. Product sucks and the quality is utterly disappointing. Got a jacket and it was so bad. Wanted to return it but they stick to stupid return policy that when reading doesn't make any sense. Doesn't deserve one star either.</Review>

Love, love, love Jet's. I've been getting my coffee here for over 18 years. The owner is an awesome lady and in all the yours I've gone here I've never had a bad experience. I even followed them from spring valley to bonita. Aside from great customer relations they're delicious!!! (Support small businesses) ❤❤❤❤<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Jets Espresso is my go to coffee place in the mornings! I like to call in my order so it’s already ready for pick up. Mary is the sweetest and is one of the nicest and positive people I have ever met. The coffee is delicious and her bagels are toasted perfectly. During pandemic times she’s always wearing a mask or face mask as well. Definitely stop by here and support a small business! You won’t regret it.<//review>< user>

I have found an amazing little spot that has the most awesome coffee around.

No need for Starbucks to remember your order, make yourself a regular and your order is on file with Mari and she gets it right every time.

If you don’t believe me, just stop by. Coffee regular</Text>

<review>I try to support small businesses as often as possible. I really like this one. The only complaint I have is the extra charge for credit card purchases, which I understand why small businesses do it, but most people these days don't even carry cash. Anyway, for this place I try to pay in cash.</review>< pics>

Being out in California with all the chain everything's, this is a breath of fresh air with the nicest owner and greatest staff. Not only do the remember my drink even when I've been gone for Months, but they also remember my preferences, actually care to ask me about my self , and just added the best, killer bagels I've come across in San Diego (another staple of a new Yorkers life). This is my coffee shop for sure. Highly recommend, wish I could give more than 5 stars.</text><user>103616087027040202924</user>< Time>

<user_id>104829132469053021009<//user_id><Text>J.E.T.S. Espresso is the spot to go - As a coffee enthusiast, it is so wonderful to be able to try out so many different flavors. Most Coffee Shops just have caramel, mocha, etc, which gets old really fast! But at J.E.T.S. they have such a huge variety of flavors - I look forward to trying out the next drink! And its always great. Not to mention how sweet and friendly the staff are. Seriously, I will never go to another place for my coffee!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Ok, Jets espresso is the best!!! It always fast and delicious not to mention fresh. You never get that gross stale taste from the coffee like you do other places. The owner/employee, possibly named Jet, that's always there is super friendly as well.< /Review>< rate>

Service is horrible, I asked for a cup of ice the lady... we do not give cup of water or ice here... I said is ok if you need to charge me for it... she charged me $1.50 for the smallest ice cup and I said that cup is too small  at least I was expecting a 16 oz cup.. ... she got upset because  i told her that i will take money back if she could not give me a bigger cup and only gave $1.00 back instead  of $1.50.  Never going back.<//text>

J.E.T.S. Espresso is the perfect place to come and buy your coffee, smoothies, frapps and many other delicious drinks. Service is outstanding and convenient because it's a drive thru, drinks are amazing and Mary the owner is very very nice and friendly. Let's support our family owned and local businesses! You will not regret it!</text>

Pedro is awesome! He fixed my flat tire and only charged me 15/dollars!! He was done in 15 minutes! Fastest service I’ve seen! He explained exactly my options and offered me the best deal for my car!

Honestly great prices, fast and exceptional service!! I went to so many places to get my tires changed , they all were crazy expensive.  I finally came here and It was perfect 👌 they even recommended me to a great place to get my alignment.  This tire shop isn't trying to get rich of one client.</text>

Pedro and Rosa we’re sincerely nice and ready to help me when I came in with my car after having a brake issue. They reached out and went out of their way to find the problem and also solve it. Amazing deals on brand new tires and everyone there is surprisingly nice! Highly recommend this business!<//Text>

Very fast and super friendly. Anytime I need tires I always come here. They're very reasonable on their prices and they care more about making sure you're safe vs trying to sell you anything like these other places. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for being trustworthy.<//Review>

<review>First trip to this location for tire needs. I brought it in , was greeting right away and helped within 5 minutes. The technician identified my slow leak issue down to a valve stem that was leaking . Had me back up and running witting 30 minutes ! Amazing staff and amazing customer service !

They also have new tires and very inexpensive prices when I could afford it that's where I'm going to go to get all four tires new on my vehicle.

<Text>This is the place to go for tires. Visited here because it was highly recommended by a friend. Quick and thorough service at great prices. Replaced all 4 tires on my '15 Subaru Forester and saved over $200 compared to the dealer. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dc76bad0d0650b:0x38e0e6347084ef06</gmapID></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I can't think of anything negative about my visit. I called him when he opened to get my tire repaired. I was in and out in under 15 minutes. $13.
I asked him if the repairs last and he stated they do because he puts the patch on the inside. Sounds logical.
Super friendly owner. Family run. Great prices on new tires, too.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Family-owned and operated tire shop in Vista. They are a bit tucked in off the street inside the Olive Melrose Olive Center, but they are a true gem. They have a large selection on-site, and when you buy tires from them they provide free rotations, balancing, and patching for the lifetime of your tires. Great customer service, and fast. I'll be back in 6 months for my rotation and balancing! :D Thanks MC Tires!!!</Review><UserId.>102578728035077558430<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I've gotten new shoes for my big truck, new shoes for my little cars, used single tires and sets to tide me over and had tires repaired.  I've always been treated very well and very fairly and have never had a long wait.  I'm a loyal customer for this honest and capable business.</Text>

First time going. Very impressed with serice, the food and hospitality. Asked for a window seat with view near heater, they actually gave me what I asked for. First time since C-19 we get this caliber of service. Going back next week again.< /Text>

4 of us had a dinner there.  Waitress and hostess were attentive. Food dishes where great for fish fry, rack of lamb and clam dish.  Pork chop was ok but not fantastic. There is a corkage fee for those that are wondering.
All in all a pleasure.  Reservations are recommended.<//Text>

The pasta with additional shrimp is my favorite. My husband, and I love this place! We are glad Laura and Gon manage to stay afloat after all CA ever changing rules and regulations for the restaurant industry. Good job! Will definitely comeback for more!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Had lunch with a friend . Service super slow, staff well mannered but forgot to bring sweetener for tea.  Food was very good and well presented. However , we  each gave our  credit cards to split the  lunch.  My friend was charged half but I was told my credit card didn't  work. So  we agreed to put my half on  my friend's card. This time however they charged her the full amount instead half.  When I  got home, I called my bank  concerned that my credit card was denied.. To my surprise  I was told that I  WAS charged  for the lunch and the  card was not denied !!
What a mess ! I drove back and was told that  they realized that I was charged  after all  and they were trying to  remove  the charge. I was told  I should wait a few days to see if  they were able to cancel the charge.. In the meantime , they had no idea why my friend was charged  on for half the meal and then for the whole meal. ( she didn't realize this until she got home )
She too is waiting until the manager returns.  It seems to me that the cashier is not properly trained  .   Masks and distancing were observed .  So far it costs a total of $100. for   a hamburger lunch for two.  Hope they straighten it out.
Sorry to have to write this review .  I want them to succeed since  they have a hard  act to follow.<//text>

Beautiful waterfront view, truly a little paradise in Richmond.  Took a chance on the soft shell crab sandwich, and I was blown away how good it tasted.  The fries were perfect also.  Would love to go back and try other items.  Friendly staff and good service.</review>

Great food and the bar is the real secret: you can hang out here and enjoy some of the delicacies from the menu at reduced Happy Hour prices.  I found the service to be outstanding!

Lara has done a wonderful job of reincarnating former Salute without losing any charm, but has greatly enhanced the experience with her own twist.

Definitely a destination for work dinners and out-of-town visitors.</Text>

<review>Lara’s Fine Dining Restaurant has excellent food.  The fresh baked bread was very special and delicious.  The
waterfront location is beautiful.  The
negative was a visit during their “Happy Hour” from 3PM-6PM, and I do not recommend their drinks.  The Margarita cocktail was served in a short glass,
full of ice, and not much flavor.  The restaurant needs focus on Customer Service as we were not satisfied with
the way staff greeted and served us.
The so called bartender sucked and the
guy was very rude that brought out the
fresh served bread.  The hostess Sarah was very nice and apologized for the other staff members bad vibes.</review>< pictures>

<time>1532008559540</time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I've heard people say that they won't use Arco gas. But I have a Toyota Solara that I bought in 1999 and I have used Arco gas in that car since I bought it. When I bought my car I read the owner's manual and it told me that I could use regular unleaded gas that I didn't need to use the more expensive grade of gasoline. So here we are almost 20 years later and I'm still using Arco gas. the gas prices as high as they are I can't believe that anybody would buy gas from anywhere but Arco! They always have the best prices sometimes $0. 50 a gallon cheaper then the other gas stations! And if you pay cash you even get more value for your money! Why anybody would go to Mobil Shell or Chevron is beyond me? So for me the proof is in the pudding, I've got almost 300, 000 miles on my Toyota and Arco gas has been just fine for my car!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I just left Joes Smog and this is my third trip to his business for smog tests on my vehicles. Joe is an outstanding man, he is courteous and professional. How does someone who performs so many smog checks remember the individual? I don't know but when I walked in he greeted me, shook my hand, and said welcome back. Joe told me it would be about a half an hour because he has one running and one waiting. He was telling the truth, within 30 minutes I was paying my bill. I see that there is one review that claims he does not honor the $45 out the door price, they must be mistaken. All three times I have left paying the $45 he quoted. Lets be honest, this is something we all have to do, it is something that takes time away from something we would rather be doing... Who wants to spend time dealing with car stuff? If you have to do it, why not spend your time, and hard earned money, with a business that appreciates it. I recommend that if you have to smog your car, go see Joe, you wont be disappointed.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I rushed into Joe's between appointments needing a smog check this month. He was knowledgeable, good natured, and the price was great!  I also loved the convenience of pulling right in without a lot of traffic hassle. The service was definitely express, and the waiting area was a great spot to use my laptop and take a quick peek at work while I waited.  Thanks again Joe!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<name>David Barrita</name><Review>Clean, Fast, and Truthful. I looked around perris looking for smog stations on Monday morning that could test my vehicle as quick and affordable as possible. All other smog stations did not answer there phones at 9 am when they clearly show as open. That is very unprofessional but joes smog answered quickly and he stayed true to his online price. I highly recommend his shop<//Review><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

I grew up in this neighborhood I know the former owners I know who Ed is he was a friend of my father. it's been difficult dealing with some of the staff because of their refusal to handle food properly with wearing gloves when  issuing the ice cream when they are simultaneously handling money.I stopped going for almost a year because I was tired of arguing with the female stat over this issue 😡. The last time I went  about two weeks ago, a young man help me and he wore gloves without me asking him to<//Review>

Because it's family owned and has fresh hot tamales and other food they prepare at home and bring they are friendly know the locals have an icecream area emerge they scoop it up they have all your needs a little pricy though but it's worth it< /Text>

<text>Wow!!! He said his name was Daniel... I came into the store with my four children to buy ice cream and milk and a few other items “Daniel was rushing my young children to decide what flavor they wanted. He Proceeded to laugh and joke with another customer about how many children I had. Then once He began to ring me up I noticed how high the price was Half gallon of milk was $4.45 In disbelief I asked him to take it off of my bill didn’t want it any longer. He was very playful and childish and most of all rude to me. I couldn’t understand how one of my favorite stores in the hood had become so corrupt. I asked him who the owner was and what the phone number was he told me to Google it so I did I called the store he answered saying that it was El Pollo Loco and what would I like to order then he said no I’m just playing ha ha and I asked him what is your name? He then slammed the phone down and hung up in my face. I would never set foot in that store again our spend my hard earned money unfortunately it’s sad when we own businesses and have to hire people that don’t care about the customers may God bless him.< /text>< Pictures>

Totally overpriced.  Totally over tax you. I would suggest if you are driving, keep on driving six more blocks for better prices. If walking, a little more walking won't hurt you so you don't feel like a fool for overpaying for items that you know are cheaper 6 blocks away in each direction. And they have the nerve to not take credit cards.</Text>

Very friendly staff, fast service, and the best sandwich I’ve had in a long time! They did not skimp on the veggies! I would definitely go back to this location because I’ve been to other locations and they were terrible.</Review>

Can't say enough good things about Sourdough & Co! We love it. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always super nice.

Knowing that there is usually quite a wait if you go inside, we try to order online and then head in and pick it up. That makes it a very fast trip!

The peppered turkey with cheddar is good and the southwestern salad is a definite favorite, but there are combinations for everyone. When you get a soup or salad, the sourdough comes on the side. YUM!

Grab a few cookies too, they are delicious!</text>

<Text>Fresh bread, slightly undercooked, almost like that Take and Bake bread. I liked it.  Fresh ingredients, medium rare roast beef. Their special sauce is palatable, seems mayo based. Friendly staff.  I'll be back, for sure. Beats Firehouse, IMHO.</Text>< Pictures>

OUTSTANDING -
We stopped in, and had great sandwiches created by a group of friendly builders.
The bread was fresh and crispy.  The meat was tasty, and the toppings were fresh.

Loved it - certainly going to be back!< /Text>

Service was good, staff friendly. There's a patio around the back to eat at the location, but you have to know this, I didn't see any signs to direct you there.

You are also supposed to use hand sanitizer prior to using the soda fountain, though it's up to the customer to read the sign, so you might want to choose a canned drink if you want to reduce the chances of exposure to COVID-19.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1598929283405, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your feedback, Jean!

< review>
We were here on August 6th. There is a huge sign on the door that says MASK IS REQUIRED to enter the store. We saw two young guys walking around in the store without a mask. The employees of this store served them without saying anything about the mandatory face covering that they have in place. My husband and an older gentleman draw the employees attention to this issue. The gentleman said that he has high risk of getting Covid and they should have someone that enforces the rules. They said “ it is not required to wear a mask at this store”. The older gentleman pointed at the door and said that “ there is a huge sign on the door stating otherwise” and that they should enforce it. One of the employees said that it’s the manager’s responsibility to enforce it and the manager is not here. Say what??? It is absolutely unacceptable! Many people have serious pre-existing conditions and need to be protected. It is not a big deal to wear a mask to protect each other. Finally, if your store complies with the mandatory mask wearing rule and it is clearly put on the door then ENFORCE IT! Ps: service was extremely slow with 9-10 people being behind the counter working on orders. 32 minute waiting time for 2 sandwiches.<//review>

I keep going here because there isn’t any other sandwich shop nearby. It’s really bad though so I’m finally done with it and not going to waste my money anymore. Three times now I’ve had to throw out my sandwich because it is completely drowning and soggy with what they call their special sauce (I think it’s thousand island dressing). I tell them please no sauce every time. They just can’t do it!< /Text>

Busy little sandwich shop with limited seating, but excellent sandwiches served on the best sourdough bread.

I had the Reuben, which was not a traditional Reuben, but was very good. The pastrami was a little bland, but the swiss and sauerkraut were wonderful. The pickle slice was a nice touch.

Staff were friendly and energetic.

Definitely a nice little place for lunch.<//Text>

<Text>We visit sourdough often for our large office lunches on Fridays. They are always super friendly, on time not to mention great food. These guys have taken care of our large orders every time and we never have an issue. We had a little issue today for the first time with some missing items. Instantly they had the missing items made (no questions asked) very apologetic and the owner was in the car delivery those to us immediately. He also added in some extras and a gift card. Absolutely fantastic service even when a mistake was made. I love a business that is quick to say we appreciate our customer's and right the wrong. Mistakes happen and it's nice to see a business provide such great customer service. That is becoming harder to find. Thanks again.< /Text><rate>5<//rate>< user_name>

The best sandwich shop around! The subs are huge, a good price, and most importantly delicious. Plus the guys that run this place are awesome!! Definitely recommend for everybody.< /Text>

<Review>Given this place about 8 tries or so, and they're consistently inconsistent. Sometimes they're great, sometimes you get a cold sandwich that was supposed to be hot. Sometimes you'll find long hair in your food (employees don't have their hair covered!!!). Sometimes the creamy soups and clam chowder are thick, other times they're water. When they do it right, they nail it. When they don't, they make sure you feel completely ripped off for how much you paid. They're just so freaking good when they nail it, that I keep coming back, even though it's an absolute crap shoot on what you get.</Review>< Resp>

Garlic pesto turkey sandwhich is incredibly delicious. The sourdough bread was fresh and had a nice crackle to it when i bit into it. Great service i was undecided and the women behind the counter let me sample some of the meats to help with my decision. First time there and i loved it.<//review>

Great food, but a little on the pricey side. Ordered a ham and pastrami sandwich and it was about 90% ham and only 10% pastrami, a nice 50/50 split would have been nicer. I will say that all of the ingredients on the sandwiches were high-quality, ham was especially tender. I did have a MAJOR surprise in my sandwich which wasn't good but they were very quick to remedy the situation as well as go above and beyond.< /review>

Great place for lunch! Everything is so fresh and tasty all the time! You will not be disappointed, especially in their sourdough and soups!  You save a little more with the sandwich soup meal ;)< /Text>

Notoriously slow service; but, you can't get a better sandwich anywhere. Definitely worth the 20 minute wait every single time. Friendly staff, caring owners, phenomenal customer service, honestly the best sandwich shop in the area. Hands down.< /Review>

<review>Horrible. You have the worlds simplest menu. When you get a soup you get bread. Low and behold no bread with my soup. On top of it the staff was pretty awful. Which in turn is probably why i was dissatisfied< /review>< pictures>

Looks like a chain. Feels like a "mom and pop" kinda sandwich joint. Unbelievably friendly. Great bread. Service solid. Love it!  Definite regular place for locals and a must have for people passing thru. Will stop here every trip.<//Text>

<text>The sandwiches are not what they claim. Not the best, I would go pay more for beach hut... Just saying. I ordered a salami and turkey, got 2 slices of salami and one shriveled up piece of turkey. It was so dry and the dough was tough as all hell.</text><GmapID>0x809afabb90f1c793:0x8d733695e1f24606</GmapID>< Name>

<Text>Love the sourdough bread bowls. They carry clam chowder every day as well as one additional soup that changes daily. They also have sandwiches, and all of the bread is baked in the morning and warmed in an oven just prior to serving.< /Text><name>Bryan Ferguson<//name><user>107402084031037481673<//user><GmapID>0x809afabb90f1c793:0x8d733695e1f24606< /GmapID><time>1484779500960<//time>< rating>

These sandwiches are awewsome!  My husband and I work close by in the business park and we call in an order at least once a week.  If you know what you're going to order, I suggest calling it in.  The wait can be long as this is a popular place with locals.  Great sandwiches!< /text>

<Review>Went in today to just look around and didn't have any idea of what we wanted. We tested all the firm beds and adjustable frames. The friendly sales associate Ryan Brown was so fun and informative that we ended up making our purchase today. We actually left there excited. Can't wait till our new bed arrives. Thanks Ryan and Christopher you guys make a great team I would highly recommend you to our friends.<//Review><Name>Nicole Grogan</Name>< rating>

Vaughn, our Sales Manager, is just plan outstanding!! His knowledge of the industry is bar none. Knows tons, can relate, assesses the clients needs and makes great recommendations. He’s professional, polite and has great energy/personality! We got a great mattress solution at a great price (value) and earned our trust. Vaughn’s customer service was so awesome he even helped us jump our car as our battery unexpectedly died. Did I mention this was done 1/2hr after they closed and he didn’t even seemed bothered by it. Such a nice guy. Go see Vaughn today!<//Review>

<text>Went in not sure what brand or type I was going to get for my children’s bunk bed. I was met with a welcome from the mattress firm representative Vaughn, who was awesome. Vaughn was interested in what I needed and wasn’t pressuring me to buy which in my opinion was great because he actually was paying attention to what I wanted. I walked in with an interest to buy and walked out with 4 mattresses and the best part besides the customer service was it was all under my budget. Thank you Vaughn for your time and I look forward to buying my next mattress from you.</text><user_id>108456801789767422599<//user_id><Name>JR Kumar< /Name><Time>1620847212060<//Time><Gmap_id>0x809acefd468552eb:0xb5ab086c6f366c13< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Visited the store today, and let me tell you, it was the best mattress buying experience I have ever had. Vaughn greeted us with a smile as soon as we entered. He was very informative about the differences in mattresses and allowed us to talk among ourselves; without pressuring at any moment. He was exceptional and demonstrated top notch customer service. Great place, great variety and amazing workers. Highly recommend!</Review>

<Text>My girlfriend and I upgraded our full size bed to a cal king the other day! We initially went through in to just look at beds and get an idea of what we wanted but Ryan was awesome and found an amazing bed in our price range. Today we went to pick up the bed and box springs and the great customer service continued. He gave me plenty of time to pick up my items and did not rush us at all. Ryan was a great help both days we went in and made the experience quick and easy. He made sure we got all the help we needed and answered all of our questions. He made sure we left happy and even helped load our bed into our vehicle. He’s great! Make sure when you shop here, you ask for Ryan. He’ll make sure you leave happy with a new comfy bed.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Best service EVER. I called 3 stores to buy a mattress and Ryan was the ONLY person to call me and figure out a way that I could use financing over the phone. I am home recovering fro Achilles heel surgery and it is super difficult to get around as I am on crutches now. He gave me the suoer discounted price as online special and saved me over$300. Best service ever and I have been in sales for over 40 years. They deserve 10 stars.< /Review>

<review>I was very pleased with my visit today at this store. I had planned to do some shopping around after I got prices etc. But my salesperson Christopher Gentilcore was so helpful and knowledgeable I ended up buying after he showed me many different beds I had to choose from. I especially appreciate his care and concern that I get the best mattress for me after having had many back surgeries. I definitely recommend this store with all the mattresses they have to chose from.Thanks Chris 😊< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Chris went above and beyond to make the best deal he possibly could for my wife and I and in the end we got what we wanted plus more for a great price. Chris was very knowledgeable of all of the products and specials in the store. I would highly recommend anybody in the market for a new mattress to stop by and see Chris.<//Review>

I went to your Delta Shores Store, Vaughn greeted us with a huge smile that could be seen right through his mask. He was not pushy, listened to exactly what we wanted, he was very attentive. Wonderful customer service answered all of our questions. If anyone is interested in buying a mattress go see Vaughn he’s a great guy knows his product and very willing to accommodate your needs. I feel we made a great purchase and we will be back. Thanks Vaughn for your outstanding customer service!!</Text>

Went to mattress firm to purchase a bed for my friends daughter and we met a great sales man by the name of Vaughn. We already knew what bed we wanted to purchase. Vaughn introduced him self and made us feel comfortable from the start. Very well mannered and has a great vibe. He gave us a unbelievable price that we couldn’t refuse so we purchased the mattress right away. We were very happy with our purchase. If your looking for a mattress go see Vaughn at the delta shores location. Hands down best sales person I ever met. Thank you Vaughn!!< /Text>

<text>We went in to check out Purple mattresses in person after researching it online. Ryan Brown helped us and was low-key, highly informed and had really good sales associate energy - not pushy but could easily answer all our questions with confidence. We found everything we were looking for in store and Ryan made it super easy to complete the financing. Can't wait for our new mattress and base to arrive tomorrow!< /text>< GmapID>

I LIVE for great customer service and Ryan exceeded it! Ryan was very generous to show us around and have us feel out the different types of mattresses there are. I haven’t done mattress shopping in years so I didn’t know what to expect. I was only there to look around and one small 30 minute trip ended up to be an hour with a sale. My fiancé and I kept going back and forth about dimensions of the bed vs tradition and newer models. Our room specifically wasn’t all that big so we wanted to stay within budget, fit our room,  but also pick something we liked. All at the end we chose the Purple bed in which Ryan was able to get us a great deal on! Ryan was great with informing us about material and how the beds worked as far as the traditional standard beds as well as the newer more tech-y models (Purple). We scheduled a date for delivery and was approved for financing and he made everything very simple and personable. Feels good to just talk to a salesperson professionally, but feel like a friend is really trying to help and assist us without giving too much push. That’s what I call great customer service. If I ever need anything again, I will definitely call Ryan. Very cool guy and very personable. 5/5!< /Text>< pictures>

I walked in the place was clean and quiet. Mr. Ryan Brown was a wonderful worker. He greeted me and helped me determine a good mattress for my children.  He respected the fact that I had a price range and didnt try to talk me into buying something higher. Great place and great price!</text>

<review>My wife (Linda) and I (Ryan) were in need of a new bed. We decided to stop by the Mattress Firm here in Delta Shores to check it out. We were helped by an associate named Vaughn. He spoke to us about every aspect of the bed first which mattered a lot to ensure we got the exact option that would satisfy us. He walked us through the different mattress choices based on our preferences. He allowed us to test out each one with an adequate amount of time and eventually guided us to a Tempur-Pedic Pro Adapt Medium Hybrid bed including Ease adjustable base as well which is the one we chose in the end. Vaughn’s patience, guidance, decorum, and knowledge was a true pleasure to have during our visit. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience than what he provided us. People like him is the reason why sales get done and customers leave happy. Thank you for everything!< /review><Gmap_id>0x809acefd468552eb:0xb5ab086c6f366c13<//Gmap_id>< Time>

You get to try the beds in person, figure out what you think you like, they offer a solid trial period for you to try out each bed and adjust it in and break it in.

You wont know what you like until you truly try it after 30 days and adjust to it.<//Text>

Just wanted to say how helpful Vaughan and staff we’re I recently purchased a bed from another store near by your location
And have had nothing but disappointment

The staff at the other store which I won’t name
But it would be easy for you to figure it out
We’re just useless they had no knowledge of there products

I actually had to come in to your store (Mattress Firm )to ask questions about the bed I purchased from the other store

Anyway to make a long story short
I just wanted to say blessed you are to have such great and Knowledgeable Staff at your

Delta Shores location I’m kicking myself for not coming to you first keep up the good work

Love you Mattress Firm💯🔥</Text>

Vaughn did an amazing job of informing me about the Tempurpedic products. I had my mind made up I wanted that brand. He knew his stuff and was very professional. I am very happy with my purchase and Vaughn’s excellent service.<//Review>

My husband and I purchased a bed earlier this year, though we really liked two mattress options. We went with a Purple mattress, but after six months I'm still not sleeping well on it. I called today with the details of the other mattress I wrote down and spoke with Damien who provided excellent customer service. He was helpful in explaining some of my options and I was able to purchase the other mattress over the phone with ease. I am also getting a new box spring which was part of the holiday sale. I'm very pleased with Damien and the service provided from this location. Highly recommended!< /Review>

My visit was very pleasant. I was greeted as soon as I arrived. I was asked what my needs were and my budget. I was offered to test several mattresses that met my needs. The whole process went very smoothly. They had a great selection of mattresses for all sleep levels and budgets. I would recommend Mattress Firm.< /Review>

I would’ve loved & definitely prefer Bill to receive whatever sales incentive received for selling me my Sealy Hybrid Premium Silver Chill Plush mattress. My second interaction with him & I’m very impressed & extremely pleased. His attentiveness & willingness to make sure I was happy & completely satisfied when I left the store today was truly outstanding! He took care of me and I really wanted to give him a hug for reaching out regarding my last review, but due to social distancing, I couldn’t! He’s amazing & his concern felt authentic... I appreciate you Bill 🤗. If you’re looking to buy a mattress from Mattress Firm, please see Bill Y. He is definitely that guy & he will take care of you! Please believe me, I wouldn’t lie.<//review>< Pictures>

If you're in the market for a new bed, Bill Young at Mattress Firm Delta Shores is definitely the man to talk to. For me, buying a new bed was a big, serious purchase. Bill is kind. He's been doing this a long time so he's extremely knowledgeable and the confidence he has in the products he's selling really put my mind at ease. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Purchase your next bed here, it will be a purchase you won't regret!< /text>

My wife and I stopped by mattress firm on whim while doing some shopping in the area. Upon entering, a gentleman named Ryan was quick to greet us and make us feel welcome. Ryan listened to all our needs and provided us with great information without being overly pushy like other mattress shops we visited. After being very patient with my indecisiveness, Ryan worked with us on our budget and choice of mattress to give us a bed and base to meet our expectations and more! I wasn’t planning on buying at that moment, but Ryan from mattress firm is worth the visit for all your mattress needs. 10/10 experience.< /review>

<review>I came in the store and was instantly greeted by the staff. A rep names Vaughn assisted my husband and I as I explained I wanted to return the mattress I purchased a few months that ago as it was not comfortable. Vaughn looked me up and we went over my options and I found a bed I believe will suit my needs. Vaughn’s customer service was over the top! He was very professional and knowledgeable of the mattresses and explained my options and what would be the next steps. I will definitely be back if I need another mattress!!<//review>< Pics>

Simply awesome!! A terrific place to shop!!!!!!
Ryan was very attentive and listened to what I had to say about how I sleep, what my issues were....he had great suggestions and I felt comfortable with them. i ended up  buying  a more expensive bed than I anticipated but I’m ok with that—anything to give me a good night’s sleep!!!!!!!!< /text>

Damien was quick and incredibly nice to talk to. I walked in having 3 mattresses in mind and he explained the difference of them and I got to feel the difference myself. There was no question that he was unsure about and explained everything perfectly. The other associates there were really nice too and we had a funny conversation. I definitely recommend this mattress firm.< /Text>

Both sales associates, Bill Young and Rennie Tominbang, customer service was superb! They knew their product very well. My mother-in-law came in to purchase a mattress and I was just browsing around the store. In the end, I made another a purchase...🤔🥳
I would recommend this place to my friends and family!👍🏽< /text>

They are now open for private viewings of the showroom. The store is very clean and well sanitized. They took every necessary precaution to keep you safe. Bill & Kati were awesome! They were very knowledgeable of there products. Made me feel very comfortable and were very friendly. They also had me laughing the entire time. Gave me a very good deal on a Beautyrest mattress and fast shipping. Such a good experience.</Text>

Ordered a matress online, went into a store to checkout the feel of a similar one to one i purchased before delivery day. Ordered box springs in store and the lady was helpful. The men who delivered were great, kind, respectful of property and followed their company safety guidelines (per covid). Thanks!!</Review>

Amazing experience! Bill was insightful and helpful. He helped my husband and find the perfect mattress! He even let me use his iPhone charger when I had to do a quick bank run! 10/10 would recommend. They even have some great financing options. Everyone on the team at some point helped us and created a welcoming experience. I didn’t feel pressured at any point. Thanks guys!</review>

Was in the market for a bed and contacted my local mattress firm which is Delta shores spoke with a young lady by the name of Katie who was very sweet. only one customer allowed in the store at a time and it's by appointment only which I like with everything that's going on right now. Everything was wiped down before I laid on it after I got up off of it it was wiped down I liked it You have to wear a mask It keeps me safe and your employees safe. Katie was very knowledgeable very sweet .<//text>

Mattress Firm online is the worst.  The experience has been horrific.  They are so wanting to sell you things but when you get what you don’t want and have to exchange- they suddenly don’t have any one to speak to and then have all these extra fees to restock and remove the mattress which they fail to mention when purchasing it.  They’re follow through to fix things is so bad.  I would never recommend them unless you go to the store and work with Damien at the  Delta Shore store.  He’s such a great person with amazing customer service skills.  He helped resolve things and absolutely is the only reason will still purchased an amazing mattress.< /Text>

Bill Young was very informative and was able to make a good deal for me. It's rare, but my shopping experience was more practical and cheaper than online shopping, trust me, I always do my research. This time human experience beat the online experience.</review>

<Text>My husband and I went in to the Delta Shores Mattress Firm today and were quickly greeted by Vaughn. He remembered us from a previous day that we were in just to gather information. Vaughn was helpful in showing us a variety of models that fit the feel we were looking for and gave us ample time to try each one while explaining the features and benefits. He was patient as we tried multiple mattresses and them re-tried them again even taking the time to adjust the base of each one to our perfect setting.
In the end, we liked the firmness of the Beautyrest Beyond, but also the conformity of the Tempur-pedic. Thus, Vaughn directed us to the Beyond Hybrid where we found love, but the price was more than we had planned on. There was Vaughn again to the rescue! He got us out the door for a total price within our budget for the mattress and head/foot adjustable Sealy base!
No more back pains and tossing and turning from over heating for us! This mattress and base keeps us cool and comfortable all night.
Thank you again Vaughn!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>I am so impressed with the customer service and the quality of the products I purchased from Mattress Firm at Delta Shores. Michael was a great sales representative to work with. I am a first time mattress buyer and have spent my whole life sleeping on hand me down mattresses so I really didn't know what I wanted or needed. Michael took the time to find what firmness level works for me and educate me on mattresses in general. I did not feel pressured and felt like he tailored the deal to my needs and budget. I was offered some incredible pricing that was well worth the investment. FYI, adjustable bases are so worth it! Even in the middle of moving, Michael was able to work around that to smoothly get me a new mattress. Thank you for the great service. I will definitely be recommending this company and location to people I know!<//review><rating>5</rating><Date>1575589033750< /Date>< userid>

<Text>Awesome job, Bill! Thanks for the great deal on the mattress package. Had no intentions on getting anything except to just look around but Bill offered us something we couldn't refuse. The no credit check made the process extra fast and easy. Oh, it was a great way to spend Valentine's Day<//Text>< pictures>

I went the Mattress Firm last weekend to shop around for a king mattress. Michael greeted me as I entered the store and immediately began to assist in my shopping experience. He started whipping out different mattresses for my daughter and I to try and even gave us pillows for the whole effect. I received a phone call from a relative and had to leave the store but I told Michael that I would return later in the evening. When I returned, he picked right back up where we left off. He was able to give me an amazing deal that included a speedy delivery of my foam mattress! I am extremely happy with the mattress selection as well as the customer service that I received last weekend and today (I went back to get mattress protectors). Thank you so much Michael!!!!<//Text>

I had been looking at getting a purple mattress for a few months now but wasn’t sure if it was worth it. I got in contact with Katie Foster out of the delta shores store and she answered all the  questions I had. She was very informative and personable and was able to help me start the process from home.</review>

My experience with mattress firm was nothing short of amazing. I went in expecting to have to pay cash for my mattress because of my credit but with their flexible programs and easy credit approval I was able to get a high quality mattress at a great price with affordable monthly payments. I have already recommended this store to four of my friends who have since gone in and received the same level of customer service and experience and have all left with a great deal!.< /text>

<review>Our sales associate Michael P, did a fantabulous job! We had a certain mattress picked out that they apparently stopped carrying, and he kindly redirected us to a new one almost identical that was still in our price range! He was kind, caring, and considerate and didn’t try to up-sale us things we couldn’t afford! Overall amazing first experience at Mattress Firm!< /review><user_id>104083877612435326837< /user_id>< Rate>

<time>1590016612954</time><Text>Open by appointment, helped me find a new bed with kind service. I'll be well now. :)

The price markup for haggling is absurd, though. Managed to spend just under 25% of the prices that they marked their mattress at and yet I still feel like I overpaid. I understand that furniture stores markup their items, but more than 400%? Ew. The staff was kind, but the company itself is one I will not be dealing with for future purchases.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809acefd468552eb:0xb5ab086c6f366c13<//Gmap_id>< username>

Bill was super helpful and made my shopping experience very simple.
Purchased a Tempurpedic and he got me 60 months interest free financing and I have the best sleep ever!
Go see Bill for a thorough sleep needs assessment!< /Review>

We should have done this months ago, but we LOVE our mattress. We got a great deal and our salesman Julio was AWESOME. He honestly could have not given us a better deal. We left happy and fulfilled. And the mattress for sure is as good as he said it would be. That matters a lot. Julio was honest and open to pricing and the types of mattresses that was presented to us. Thank you!< /Text>

We had the pleasure of working with Melissa in getting our new mattress ordered and delivered TOMORROW. Freakin tomorrow. How convenient. She was very personable and knowledgeable in all things mattress (like I learned stuff about my muscle system and sleeping that I had no idea about!)
All around an amazing experience. Thanks Melissa :)< /text>

I went to another location in Elk Grove and the same exact mattress cost so much more & we were told that every store would be the same price. But since my brother and my aunt previously bought from the Delta Shores location, I still wanted to check it out. And I’m so glad that I did. I’m so excited to get my new mattress to help improve my back pain. S/O to Mike for such a great service!<//Text>< Pictures>

We decided to finally purchase a new bed, so we returned to the same store that we made a purchase at a few months ago for our parents. Delta Shores, I had so many questions about a mattress, also they tell you so much information & most of it was always too much for me. I would always just walk out feeling confused & not making a purchase. Today I told my husband let’s go look, so we walked in Juan greeted us, I told him that I wanted to be able to tell him what we were looking for in a mattress, like I’m a side sleeper, plus I suffer from acid reflux & I wanted an adjustable frame (medium) I like pillow top as well. I explained that I wanted all.that made a difference in sleeping well, all night, Juan was knowledgeable, professional he wasn’t rushing us or forcing a purchase. So we made a purchase, we are happy & I’d come back to this same store and refer our friends & family.
Thank you so much, I’m super excited!!!<//text>

I came in just shopping for a mattress and was welcomed by and very kind and helpful sales rep named Mike Riddle. He did not pressure me nor make me feel like I needed to but anything. He was helpful in showing me mattresses that would fit my needs and was great in understanding my cost needs. I ending up buying from him even though it was not my intention when I came in because the deal was great and he was just an awesome rep. I had gone to other stores and was treating like I was just a sale and they did not really care about my needs unless it was in the higher end mattresses. I will definitely tell my friends about this location and when I am ready for another mattress in the future this is going to be my first choice.</Text>

Thankyou Bill for your excellent service!
We found an excellent bed we fell in love with!  Got a New Beautyrest Alcove Hybrid Plush King Mattress, luxury, at the price of a Queen, and a free adjustable base, heh!
Excellent delivery and set up</Review>

<text>With constant back and neck pain we finally decided on a new bed so the first place we decided on was mattress firm. And gladly to say our search for the perfect bed stopped there with the help of Tyler. It’s always amazing to save money and having the feeling you got an amazing deal just makes the whole experience worth it. Tyler was extremely knowledgeable and helpful with providing no pressure to buy. Even if your at the beginning bed hunting stage, go see Tyler for any questions you have.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Rennie Tomimbang was great! I went in looking to replace my old mattress and Rennie was so helpful. He had me try a variety of beds to get a feel for what I liked and kept me in my price range. He was super friendly and easy to work with. I highly recommend Mattress Firm in Delta Shores and ask for Rennie if he's there!</Review>< userid>

I visited the Delta Shores Mattress Firm for a firm California King mattress. Ryan was very helpful in showing me all the firm mattress options. I really liked one mattress that was out of my price range and he was able to find the same one for me at a discounted price, about 50% off!<//Text>

Michael is the mattress master. My wife dragged me out shopping to finally look at a new mattress and I couldn’t have been more surprised with how well the experience turned out. Michael came over with a friendly smile and quickly determined the best mattress for us. He had expert knowledge and provided a pressure free experience, like how my back is going to feel now. I would highly recommend Michael and this mattress firm to all of my family and friends.

This store is brand new, clean and very comfortable. Our salesman, Ryan, was amazing and educated us on so many mattress options. It had been 15 years since we bought a new mattress, and we are in love with our new selection. Ryan and team made sure to have it delivered timely, and I would definitely recommend Ryan and the Delta Shore Mattress Firm team for your next mattress purchase.</Review>

This is seriously the only place to get a top quality mattress for a great price. I stumbled in on memorial day weekend knowing NOTHING about mattress shopping and Rennie totally took care of me and made sure I walked away feeling confident in my purchase. AND, better yet, they have yummy snacks!😀

UPDATE: I had to leave another review for Tyler, he is AWESOME and really knows how to make sure that concerned customers walk away feeling happy. I was having restless nights on our new mattress and he helped me find a solution and didnt make me cough up extra $$.< /Text>

< Review>
Vaughn was absolutely amazing!! My significant other and I came in 20-30 minutes before closing time (we were desperate) and I’ve never met more of an amazing salesman. Made us feel welcome as if the day wasn’t already over. 100 stars if I could. He took care of everything, answered all questions, and was completely patient considering how late it was. He explained everything to the best of his ability and was soooooooo nice. We ended up ordering the bed we wanted, among packages, and he saved us a ton of money. Super sweet and genuine, he was wonderful overall. Thank you, Vaughn!< /Review>

<Text>This was our first time here at Mattress frim at Delta shore. Our sale person Ryan was very helpful and was very knowledgeable. Ryan provide great information about the purple mattress that we were looking into and also showed us other mattress that was similar in materials. There was no pressure and they were very welcoming.
Great customer service and recommend giving mattress firm a chance if you are looking for a new mattress.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Was looking around for the best priced and quality mattress in Sacramento. Looked at this location and sears. Turns out mattress firm specializes in beds. They have better quality and Julio was upfront and helpful with the whole process. I was able to get the bed I want at a lower price. Pretty satisfied with my experience.</review>

My husband and I had no idea what we were doing on our way in to the store but Tyler was beyond helpful. Not only is he a sleep expert but he'll also work within your budget. I definitely recommend anyone looking for a comfortable mattress on a budget to stop by the Delta Shores Mattress Firm.</Text>

<review>If your searching for a new mattress your search ends here ! Stop right in and ask for Tyler. One thing about salesman they try to be pushy into purchasing but not here. The only pressure here is their  great prices and customer service Thank you Tyler.

When we first walked in we were instantly greeted by Tyler, he provided outstanding customer service, he listen to what we wanted and helped us found our perfect mattress. First we didn’t know what we were getting ourselves into by purchasing what felt “comfortable” to us. Tyler explained to us  the more coils in the mattress a longer lasting mattress. You already know, the more comfortable it is the more pricer! but Tyler gave us an incredible price and service that can’t beat in town !

< review>
Great Location, Beautiful Show Room.

My wife and I were in need of a new bed and having lunch at In & Out and decided to walk next door and check it out.

They had a wide selection of mattresses and Tyler was very knowledgeable and helpful in helping with narrowing down the selection of mattresses to the one that best fit our needs.

We came in to look, but with the interest free financing they offered and the sale they had going we ended up getting caught in Tyler’s web and made a purchase and we LOVE our new mattress!

We called to confirm the delivery and Ryan was very helpful in providing a detailed time slot on when the mattress would be delivered and took time to assist us even though we were not his customer, says a lot about the company and staff.

Will be back for our future purchases.

We were greeted right away by two wonderful sales men at this store. Julio and Ryan helped us by providing a lot useful information while we were trying to figure out what type of mattress was best for us. These guys were every attentive and helpful with us in the purchase of our Purple mattress and provided us with great deals.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Tyler... We cannot thank you enough for helping us find the BEST mattress within our price range.

I highly recommend coming to see Tyler. He was patient, listened to our needs, was very considerate of our price range, and ultimately we left knowing that we got the king of all mattresses.

Customer service was great. Tyler is extremely personable and a great salesmen because we definitely left with more than we came for. Lol

I can’t wait to use my adjustable base with all of the bells and whistles!

We have hella kids. We will be back!< /review>< pics>

<review>As soon as I walked in I felt like the salesperson was trying to push me out the door even though no one else was in the store. I came in to look around for a new mattress and see their collection but the salesman would not let me just browse to look around, I felt extremely offended the way I was treated in there and will not be returning.  I can’t believe a store that barely gets any traffic won’t allow customers to even browse mattresses without being escorted like a thief around the store. Extremely pushy. I don’t recommend this place to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

Tyler helped me get my first mattress and a adustable base. Deals and bundling made a sleeping set possible in which i didnt think was possible until i would be in my 30's. Tyler was not pushy at all which is what ive seen way too much shopping for this mattress. Honestly best place to go to.<//text>

Ok Ok Ok! My wife and I just came into the store at Delta stores just to browse and guess what! Yup, we walked out with the cadillacs of mattresses and the adjustable base with strobe lights, lol. Tyler was a big help very knowledgeable and funny. We will return to buy our kids mattresses from now on.  (We have 4 fyi)😁. Oh shoot, wait hold up! I cant forget Ryan! I think in order for you to work here you must have great customer service skills(duh) and have 200 hours of comedy stand up, because not only did Ryan help me out he was making me laugh as well. That's a start of a good relationship😂. Well long story short this is a GREAT place to buy your mattress.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Juan was very attentive since we entered, he received us very kindly and helped us by asking the right questions and that way we could make the best choice of mattresses as well as a mattress protection set we definitely recommend this shop and Juan especially as an advisor five stars to sleep aguuuuuuuuusto thanks Juan and if we need anything else for the future we know where we should return my name is Luis Hernández
