Very good pedicure and full set. The ladies were very nice and attentive. Ruby gave a great massage with pedicure. I was the only customer left at the end of the day so they worked on my hands and feet at one time. I felt so pampered.</Review>

<Review>The pictures of my peach colored nails was my first time going to Megan’s and it was the best experience i’ve had since living in the bay area. It’s taken me lots of time and money finding a good nail salon as good as Megan’s. I got a complimentary glass of wine, a free pen, and a stamp card. My nails lasted for a MONTH and still were in good shape when i went back to get a fill. I never write long, good reviews like this but this place makes me soooo happy and satisfied ❤️❤️❤️</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw3A2761Muu-9-XvIU9m4s6YPMloPUVYfcNVA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqLkqpyePulLtimoqYSvm6cGhGUCBSOCc2l-Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOybaqNPZ34-HCpMR5vx7UghE4cvHQ8PZ1KdMY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

I'm looking for a new nail salon.  The woman I had for several years has left the area. I decided to try Megan's and I found it clean, and a very eclectic interesting decor. I wanted an acrylic American manicure but they didn't quite do that they used polish instead of white and pink acrylic so I know my nails will begin to chip soon. When she completed my nails they looked very nice. I will go again to see if they can do the acrylic so that they last longer! As I said the completed look I was quite satisfied with!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I've been a regular at Megan's Nails Salon for roughly 5 months now and I am hooked! This place has everything youd need for a perfect mani-pedi and more. At first glance this salon is pretty, clean and inviting. All the ladies are so sweet and hospitable on many occasion I've been offered snacks and beverages while I wait and during my pedicure. Of course by now I have favorites,( and yes I'm a little stingy to say that I don't want to share but..) Lisa and Jade are my fabulous Duo. These two ladies are wonderful in what they do; I always walk out overjoyed and so thankful!! And did I forget to mention that I always get so many compliments on my nails!!</Review>< Pictures>

I like here. Their service is good and the staff(Lisa) did my nail precisely, but when I booked the appointment, I told them I was going to get a basic manicure. When I got there I got Gel nail, so I paid for gel nail price that I didn't expect. Overall, good service and technic.<//Text>

I paid but was completely unhappy with their work. I went to another salon to correct the thickness of the acrylic to the sorry nail polish application. She attempted to correct the color flaws and used way too much polish but failed to cover the corners of the nail. One hot mess. Next I paid for the most expensive pedi and got the least work done, enough said. I thought so, but wait I left no tip leaving the establishment. I was the last customer of that Friday evening; as I was stepping into my vehicle I realized I forgot my wallet. Do you think that as the wallet sat it their face as they closed out their earnings they would have ran out with wallet in hand? Nope! They helped themselves to closely $5 worth of quarters in my wallet. They ( husband & wife) would not look in my eyes when I asked for my wallet.  I stread they looked at the floor. I can tell you this, I hold no I'll will. The future of this business will forever thirst and yet NEVER be quenched.  This whole experience is wrong and dishonesty has no place in our community! I would not recommend this place.< /review>

I went here for pedicures when I was SUPER pregnant and couldn't reach my toes. They are always very friendly and while they will ask if you also want a manicure they are not pushy if you say no. They offer treats and drinks while you're being pampered and I had a water bottle that they happily refilled.

The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is when my friend went with me they cut her big toenail too short and she got an ingrown. SO if you're prone to that sort of thing be aware, personally i had no problem mine.< /Review>

Just got my nails done here. The lady messed up the design on one of nails. Very badly. I asked the man at the front before I paid if she can fix it. He said come back tomorrow at noon. First off, $40 for a fill is crazy to me, second your nail tech just messed up my nail and you’re telling me I can’t sit back down so she can fix it, and third of all I have things to do. I cannot plan my weekend around the fact that she can’t do nails. Very disappointed with their service.<//review>

<review>$5 to take of gel. That's already kind of annoying but okay. I picked a light pink gel polish but the lady doing my nails put on 4 thick layers so it came out much darker and with four layers they feel lumpy and look streaky and of course they started chipping by the 2nd day. I liked the place, staff was friendly, they sat me almost immediately even though they did have a good amount of people and there was 30 min to closing so I really had high hopes that this would be my new nail place but the quality of the manicure was disappointing. After 6 days a lot of it was peeling and getting caught on everything and chipping more so I tried chipping it all off and most of the polish came off whole, with no damage to my nails and very minimal effort. I'm pretty sure this was regular polish and not the gel I paid for.....<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>I've even here twice and enjoyed my time! However this time when I came in I ask for Shellac Color Change for $15..about 4 times I told them i wanted this.. the manicurist started doing a full manicure... I interrupted her saying i just wanted a color change. She said yes. Yet she continued... and at a point I just had to take my hand away saying i only wanted a color change... so I left with my nails just cleaned, no polish, for $15. Not coming back here again.

PS... also when explain the situation to the manager, he instead blame me for not stoping her... when i tried stopping her several time. Then she decided to yelled at me, infront of the other clients. I just said im just gonna pay for my so call $15 service. Thats what happen with the manicurist is married to the manager. #smh.</text><user>110755771386907222927<//user>< time>

Highly recommend the bike shop. Bought the Giant Propel in 2015 brand new. After 5 years, realized that the bike haven't been serviced except chain cleaning. And today Alex took the bike and did the tune up for free because the bike is free for lifetime tune. So highly recommend buying bike from the shop and great service from the staff.< /Review>

<review>Called ahead. Introduced himself, and answered my questions. When I arrived, they acknowledged me even though they were helping others. Quick wait to fix back tire. Knowledgeable, gave me options to fix, educated on Fremont area. Gave differences in cost with options so I could make a decision. Will be back to this store instead of another. Price is competitive, service is great! Highly recommend!<//review><resp>None<//resp><Time>1609106779114</Time>< Name>

Quick service, went in for a stem/handlebar replacement and tire change. In and out within 20 minutes. Also did a tune up a few months back and they also did great job. Good customer service 👍.<//text>

I've been here several times and even though I've only bought a few things they've been awesome each time. Though they are busy, it doesn't take long for someone to check to see if you're being helped or not. They always take the time to make sure all your inquires are answered. Also, they are always understanding of my elementary bike knowledge. Thanks guys!<//text>

The service at CentriPEDAL was fast, competent, and friendly. Labor seems to be pricy, but that is understandable and they were happy to just get me the parts I needed so I could do stuff myself. Even swapped the freewheel for me free of charge, because I didn’t have the tool and they didn’t have it in stock to sell to me. Great experience.<//Review>

{'time': 1599190004907, 'text': 'Hello Vicky. This inf on flat repair is not true. We have been fixing flat tires all through the month of August in a 1-3 day turnaround, no exceptions. I can personally guarantee that. I’m pretty sure this is a troll msg. If not please respond with with more detailed and less vague info. Thank you. James Rardin - Owner\n\n9/6/20\nWow.  You have not provided additional inf, just an anonymous rant and now threats.  I am not discouraging reviews.  I apologize for assuming this was a troll msg.  When the name is cryptic, details are vague, and so far off from what we are normally doing it caused me to suspect.  I am not calling you a liar, I am however questioning your perception of events.  We have been doing flat repairs throughout the month of August in 1-3 day turnarounds.  I know this because I have personally been doing most of them each day after close.  All the staff know this.  The only reason that any of us would have said we cannot do a flat repair until September is that we cannot get the part.  And this is in fact a huge problem right now.  We have not been able to get 16", 20", and 26" tubes or tires for almost 2 months.  Most eta\'s are end of September/early October.  It has nothing to do with not wanting to help folks with their needs.  We simply cannot get lots of parts right now.  Perhaps there was a misunderstanding on that?  Or possibly you needed more than just a flat repair?  Hard to say but it feels like some information is missing which is why I asked for more details in my first msg.\n\nYou said everytime you come in we disappoint you.  That is unfortunate.  I think your decision to shop elsewhere is for the best so that you do not feel so much aggravation and grief.  Wish you the best in finding a store that can meet your needs.'}< /response>

<Text>Been there a few times due to it being close to my house.  Every time we go they disappoint. One time we waited until they opened for them to say they bike fixing (change of tube) was going to take until September!  Don't know if the guy was just lazy or what! If that is the case they should put up a sign on the window. It's all about customer service!

UPDATE: Replying to owner. How dare you say my review is a lie! Not my fault your employee was lazy and didn't want to help my son out. Stop spending so much time trying to defend your staff and have a meeting with them about customer service.  Definitely never going to your store now. If you reply being defensive again I will report you to the BBB. You could learn some customer service as well. BTW these reviews exist to help other people not waste time. I rarely give negative feedback, only if it's a MUST!</Text>< rating>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Made us wait for over an hour outside the store. Then one of the younger reps came and when somebody in the line inquired about how long it would take, he became loud and rude and started misbehaving with the elderly gentleman. Most of the staff did not have masks on.

When I reached the service area and requested to install a new tube, the guy said that my tire was gone and he would only fix it if I buy a new one for $62. I walked out of the store and installed the tube and the tire on my own. There was nothing wrong with it. Terrible service. Will never go there again.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>
{'time': 1597019583868, 'text': 'Hello House Mate.  Yes, the wait yesterday was exceptional due to a crush of customers.  Unfortunately, there is little we can do about that as we are trying our best to abide by county social distancing regulations to keep you, other customers, and our staff safe.  For perspective, there are 3 bike stores in our area of 350,000 residents.  To say demand for bicycle service is overwhelming right now is an understatement.  We are booked through the end of September (7 weeks), but we are still trying to service customers like you with minor repairs more quickly.\n\nI believe your account is inaccurate at several points.  I am the owner and was here all day.  I can personally vouch that my staff was wearing their masks all day.\n\nAdditionally, the outside interaction that you are referring to was not my staff member yelling at the customer.  The customer was yelling at my staff member.  My staff member did not lose his temper, he had to raise his voice in order to be heard as the customer was quite hostile toward him.\n\nWhen you came in our service manager assessed your tire and believed it was damaged beyond repair.  We will not put a tube in a tire that we feel is going to be unsafe or explode immediately.  The legal liability for us is too great.  You were shown the 3 options that we have which would have fit your requirements $25, $40, & $62 options.  I guess you only remember the $62 option.  These are all we have right now.  Parts for bicycles, just like bicycles themselves, are increasingly difficult to get.  I am sorry we could not meet your expectations.'}<//response>

Asked for a shifter for 3x7 mountain bike. They sold me the 3 speed front shifter for a 3x8 pair at 2x the price I find elsewhere. Now I will have an unmatched set that cost more. Not recommended.<//Text>

Got to the shop, Nick ( Sale Person) was very informative on the bikes.  Needed a mountain bike for communing to work due to the last bike broke on me. Nick gave me the break down of what type of bikes are for certain terrains and what was the best choice for my needs. Overall everyone were very helpful and knowledgeable. Got the bike i wanted.<//review>

Fixing a bike here is a bit of expensive thing. Just a flat tire cost you 21+ bucks. Customer service is not satisfactory. For example, you need to wait for 2+days to get your bike serviced. No calls after service made. Pick your bike if you remember it.< /review>

<Response>{'time': 1597422992595, 'text': 'Hello Jeya.  Thank you for your feedback.  I am sorry you did not receive a phone call from us.  It is our policy and our habit to call, text, or email customers when service is complete.  We may have made a mistake in taking down your number or we may have, in fact, forgotten.  Either way this was not our norm.  We are repairing about 100 flats/week right now.  And on that note the pandemic has bicycle service departments across the nation backed up for 4-8 weeks.  We are booked through the end of September.  However we are trying to get minor things like flat repair done more quickly.  I can say with confidence that you will not find any bicycle store in the Bay Area right now that could fix your flat in less than a week.  As far as pricing goes, your cost included the tube.  Tubes are $6-$8 and Labor is $15.  Labor is not as cheap as it once was.  I think you will find that we were very competitive if you shop around.  Sorry we could not meet your expectations.  Thank you again.'}<//Response>< Date>

You can always leave a msg on the phone or even msg us here on google. We check every msg and respond. I’m not sure what the hanging up on you problem is but we don’t hang up on people on purpose. That is not how we treat folks so I’m not sure what happened there.  Sometimes we hit the wrong button and sometimes the line drops too.

Personal story: I got invited after 5+ years of not biking to bike again... Tomorrow. Fearing since my front brakes were blown (hose to master cylinder blew) and my grips melting from sitting out in the sun I brought my bike to my shop to fix (I mean a auto shop has 70% of what I need to fix bikes.)

Thinking it would be cheaper and cleaner to install a pre assembled Hydraulic disc brake kit, I used Google and tried to source a basic (just for now since we're not throwing our bikes off hills... Yet.) Brake system. Shimano being a reputable I called in to inquire if they had it in stock since online said "maybe."

Called not knowing it was 11:35am I realized they don't open till noon. Left an voicemail and surprisingly, I received a call around 12:30 with the fact I gave them an oddball part number, but asked about a basic brake kit. Guy on the phone offered "we got this kit" and so things were settled. I'm going up to Fremont rather than driving to Santa Cruz.

took "lunch" to drive up to Fremont to this store and was nicely greeted asking what I was looking for, pointed me to the products I needed (with recommended products, but not pushy to sale a specific (potentially higher markup) item. I selected my items and went to the parts/repair area.

"What were you looking for exactly?"

I replied "a Shimano handle and caliper premade"

He replied "oh you called earlier right?"

After that I was handed the item, paid for it and booked back to the shop and rapidly threw it on, bedded the brakes and I'm now ready for our socially distancing trail ride.

Too long, didn't read: no pushy sales people, prices are fair, didn't have any bad vibes, wish they had more variety (but can't blame them totally because the store looked like a target after black Friday haha)
Oh and I didn't really dig into the parts section since there were too many people in that area

Would recommend if it's near you. As for me they luckyly had what I needed in one stop.< /Text>

Love this place. I went biking once and got 2 flat tires. We decided to buy a new bike altogether and the one i wanted was still being built. Next day, they called us and said it was ready! It was amazing how fast they got it, and their staff is just great.<//Review>

< review>
Very bad experience! This was my first visit today, the guy claim manager him self seems very mean and rude to customer. I went for flat tire repair and asked about price the other mechanic had look to my bike and told me $12. Then this person told me $15, so I asked him why two different prices? He replied they suppose to charge $20 in very rude way!!
They told me estimation of $21 which I agreed and after few minute they did I need to replace tire with additional cost. When I refuse to take their service they charged me $15 without any fb later tire repair!
I think this was my first and last experience with this shop!!! In addition when I was taking a pic of that service price he was again rude and said I have to ask for taking pic of that list? It suppose to ment for customer, whg customers need to take permission? Very unprofessional peolle.
What a bad customer service!!!< /review>

{'time': 1562192555531, 'text': "Dharmesh, I'm sorry you had such a poor experience with us. There are several things that contributed to this.  Not excuses just things to note.  The mechanic that you first worked with did not recognize immediately that your bicycle had a coaster brake.  This type of brake system with accompanying features requires quite a bit more time to work on.  Our $12 repair covers most wheels but kids bike rear wheels can have training wheels, chain guards, and a coaster brake that all must be disassemble before the wheel can even be removed.  This is why we charge $20.  The $15 was a compromise from the service manager since there were no training wheels.  Once the wheel was removed we discovered that the tire had large tears requiring that it be replaced.  Putting a new tube in a tire like that will result in an immediate failure.  So originally it was $15 for the labor and $7.99 for the tube or $22.99 total.  When we discovered the tire problem you were offered a tube and tire combo for $10 for a total of $25 instead.  At this point we had already done a fair amount of work which needed to be done in order to discover the tears in the tire.  My understanding was you did not not want to pay the $25 to have it fixed with a new tire so the service manager still wanted to charge for the labor performed at that point, then also to put the tire back on the bike and reassemble everything.  I think anger on both sides led to this unfortunate experience.  I'm sorry this didn't work out to your expectations.  Unfortunately the days of bicycle stores being able to give away free labor are gone.  Margin on products is so small now due to the internet that labor can no longer be subsidized by parts sales.  Labor must pay for itself.  We should have explained this first to avoid the conflict in expectations.  Our prices are posted on our web page and are open to the public.  I'm not sure why you were told you must ask for permission to photograph them.  I'll ask the service manager about that."}<//Response>

I come here a lot and purchased two road bikes from them. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. They spent a lot of time with me to help me select a bike that fits me well. They get really busy in the afternoon on weekends... so if you go then you should bring a little patience with you. The "lifetime adjustment" that comes with a new bike is really handy. I have had several repairs and adjustments here, and they do good work. They have a limited but complete selection of accessories (mostly Giant and Park Tool brands), but no way to browse online. They are willing to special order things, with a good price. They also organize several bike rides throughout the week. They are very service oriented.  I really recommend this place. If I could do more online shopping with them it would be 5 stars.</Text>

<text>Great shop staffed with courteous, knowledgeable people.  I'm an avid cyclist who handles most of the routine maintenance and upkeep of my bikes myself, but anything that I can't handle I hand it off to these guys.  Turn around is fast and the work is excellent.  In my time in the shop, I've seen them patiently explain entry level bikes to beginners and discuss high end equipment with seasoned riders.  Prices are reasonable, in-store selection is good for most maintenance items, and they happily order parts for upgrades/replacements.  I'm currently having two wheels built up by them, and am sure they will be of high quality.  Can't say enough good things about this shop, definitely one of the best in the bay area.<//text><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>105275106288440881431< /user_id>< date>

These guys are pretty friendly and know their stuff.  Not overly snobby like at some places. It is a very large and popular shop.  So they may have a big line, but they work it pretty fast.  I've had mixed experience getting service here, at least for wheel truing - I think they seem to only like tightening spokes.  I've since switched to a different shop and have had better service there.</Text>

This store is just 5 months new and my experience has been great. James and his crew are very knowledgeable and helpful. They don't force you into buying anything and are very patient to answer any questions you may have.

I bought a hybrid bike from this place and I am extremely happy with it. Even though it's not the store's policy to deliver, James made an exception to deliver the bike to my house in Fremont.

The service and support is excellent. I highly recommend you to check out this place if you are in the market for a bike.</Review>

Class Race Bike Enthusiasts:

CentriPEDAL just finished an overhaul of my newest classic bike acquisition from Italy, an original F. Moser Pernod.  Earlier this year after completing reassembly of my Raleigh Pro I gained an understanding of their operation and devotion to the old race bikes.

I appreciate the attention to detail by James Gluth, Alex, Adrian, Mo and other team members including the owner James.  They adjusted and repacked all my Campagnolo bearings & parts with professionalism. They understand the art and engineering of classic Euro race bikes of the past.

As a rider of classic steel since 1971, I trust these guys explicitly to do the job right the first time, and they pull it off well.   After they restored my original Raleigh Pro this spring, I rode the bike for three solid months w/o a single glitch or issue.  Thank you CentriPEDAL.<//Text>

<Text>Outstanding service,  very reasonable prices, an AMAZING trade in program that allows you to buy a beginner kid's bike and then trade it in for the FULL PURCHASE price for a bigger bike as your child grows, AND as others have mentioned, super honest, fair and efficient service when making repairs.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I went to CentriPEDAL because I needed my bottom bracket loosened by one turn. The bike was down to the frame, no cranks, no chain... only the bottom bracket. They charged me $7.00 for 45 seconds of time to loosen a bolt.</Text>

I trust this establishment as they are honest and not just trying to create work like other places like Firestone nearby. I wouldn’t trust Firestone as they gave me a false estimate on AC work but All Tune was honest and took care of my issue.< /Text>

<user>100025190394579931817</user><review>This shop did the diagnosis for our vehicle emissions monitors not ready issue for a reasonable price.  However, the diagnosis is incorrect.  The shop recommended us to replace the catalytic converter and the front oxygen sensor for over $2300.  Today we took our car to a Toyota dealership for a second opinion.  The dealership made all emissions monitors ready without repairing or replacing any parts.  The tecician at the dealership only did a specific Toyota drive cycle for the car. We were only charged for $155, and the car passed the smog check afterwards.  I will not take my car to this shop again for any services no matter how price competitive this shop is.  I feel that this shop technicians don't have sufficient emissions knowledge and the owner treated us like his money tree.

I want every one to know that before I took my car to this shop, my car with only about 31,600 miles was running like a brand new car.  It did not have any Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), or any Malfunction Indicator Lights (MIL) on.  Besides, this car did not show any symptoms of a bad catalytic converter or a bad oxygen sensor.  It has been running very smoothly with very good fuel economy.  I just replaced the car's battery about two months ago.  Therefore, all the previous stored OBDII emissions data was lost due to the lost of power.  I tried to drive both city streets and the freeways at various speeds without knowing exactly what the car's CAT and O2S drive cycles are required.  I could not get the CAT and the O2S monitors ready for the smog check.  Therefore the Toyota dealership I went to did exactly what I couldn't do on my own and made these two monitors ready for me.  They did not know me and I did not know them.  They did not need to clear any codes for me because there were no codes needed to be cleared.  Once they did the specific drive cycle for me, the OBD computer automatically made these emissions monitors ready.  The Toyota dealer could have lied to me and recommended some repairs or replacement of parts, so that they could have made some money off me.  But they did not because this Toyota dealer has the integrity with sufficient technical knowledge and does not cheat on its customer.  In addition, my husband and I have driven for a long time and my husband used to be a master auto mechanic.  Lying to us is a huge insult to our intelligence and showed a great disrespect to us, both seniors and Asians.  I am very upset and disgusted by it.<//review>< gmap_id>

{'time': 1617814609974, 'text': "Hi Rao, Thank you so much for your feedback. We are always striving to improve our company practices. It seems as though there was a misunderstanding. We followed our normal protocol for a failed smog check and began a diagnostic process. Upon completing the diagnostics we found that there are codes indicating replacement of two items in your vehicle. Of course, we could have cleared the codes and reset the car's computer to forget any codes as well. But that would be illegal and we would have lost our smog license. A smog check is scrutinized by the state of California for all visual and physical components. I am sorry we could not satisfy your request to pass the smog check in an unscrupulous manner and yes, indeed, we did recommend changing the parts. The car's computer will not forget the codes forever and you may be faced with replacing the parts recommended in the future. At which point, we would be happy to work with you and get your car in tip-top shape. We have competitive pricing and we offer a two year warranty, unlike the dealer. Take your time and come see us again!"}<//Response>

<Text>I brought my car knowing that it needed work. All Tune and Lube was recommended to me by a family member and I will do the same for you. My car had an oil leak, power steering hose was cracked and my headlight module was broken. Not only did they inform me on what needed to be taken cared of first (which helped my budget) but they we also very friendly and honest, which is a quality that is difficult to find. They are fairly priced and they finish the job in a timely manner.

There is still minor work that needs to be done on my car but I know that they’ve earned my business for the foreseeable future. Fantastic work deserves a 5 star review! Thank you so much All Tune and Lube team for making my car fixing experience a positive one! Cheers!

(Update 12/2020: My car had a coolant leak and it needed an entire replacement; radiator, hoses, coolant tank the whole 9 yards. They took the time and fixed everything with no issues!)< /Text></record>

These people stand behind their work and definitely take care of their customers! I had a bunch of work done a bit over a year ago and the same issue happened again recently due to a faulty part. Because they offer warranty for their labor and parts, they fixed it again NO CHARGE. They do what they can to make their customers happy and I would highly recommend going to them. They’re not trying to rip people off which is rare for a mechanic.<//Review>

<text>Another feel good experience with All Tune and Lube. Went in for an oil change and a leak. Found out the control arms and parts included were metal to metal. Not expecting such a big expense during these difficult times but Hamzah worked with us and we were able to have the services completed.

< Review>
The staff at All Tune and Lube are very professional and I appreciate the way they communicate with me. They explained why I needed the parts or repairs. It is nice to have a trusted place for repairs and that those repairs will  be done correctly. I appreciate it when future repairs can be delayed, so I can stay within my budget.<//Review>

<Text>Salt of the earth professionals. Shop is friendly, reasonable, accommodating, upfront, very understanding and accountable for repairs...they work with you. All in all better service and experience than some of the mainstream repair shops in the area like Firestone, especially when it comes to check engine lights, major automobile repairs or heavier maintenance.

From service to smog there is only one place in North Orange County I trust my cars to. They are honest, reasonable, and professional. I have always come for repairs to All Tune and Lube and when they recognize a repair that might be under warranty with the dealer they send me there. The honesty is something that is so hard to find which is why I highly recommend All Tune and Lube. If you are in La Habra, Fullerton, Brea, La Mirada or Whittier it is worth the trip.</Review>

Horrible ! Do they have negative stars? I drive a 2015 veloster, They told me I needed a full engine swap and me being not too familiar with automotive put my trust into them only to receive what look like something that came out of the junkyard got my car back with it coming up on the screen saying pull over when safe, safe mode enabled as if they didn't test drive it before giving it back to me and then told me that my computer will relearn itself after driving for 250 MI I spoke with the Hyundai technician who told me if any sort of TCM is swapped it must be programmed by Hyundai technician and/or have the tool to do so which this place does not have so I took it back after driving it 40 ft down the street and it driving completely horrible and unsafe and they put another engine in it. during that process I went to go get some stuff out of my car and they had the engine they just put in pulled out and the new one that they were putting in next to that one and it was night and day the first one was a rust bucket the second one looked somewhat decent still though did not program my computer told me it would fix itself my car's been sitting in my driveway for a year I've been back multiple times the warranty States 24 months 24,000 mi warranty I haven't driven over 500 MI since I've gotten the car back and they are saying that I'm way past warranty but my paperwork says otherwise so I will be taking them to court and the owner says he does not care because he has insurance that will cover it instead of just fixing my car this place is a joke</Text>

<resp>{'time': 1583001115816, 'text': 'Hi, Jacob\nWe thank you for writing your honest review about your experience. Every vendor such as a dealership or parts store has their individual warranty. Our general warranty is 24 months/24k miles. Unfortunately, with an engine replacement that costs almost $3k for the part itself then it cannot be covered under the general warranty. Our 6 month warranty was valid within 6 months of the second engine replacement. We are sorry that you could not take advantage of that warranty in the timeframe. If it was still the original time between repairs then we would have gladly did the work for free after a diagnosis confirmed the engine needed replacement. Sometimes these miscommunications can occur and we apologize for not doing a better job of communicating with you more thoroughly. We will continue to improve our services and communication.'}</resp><gmapID>0x80dd2ac0fe8aaa13:0xc15af546f19c2d2e</gmapID>< username>

<Review>My old Nissan Pathfinder 1997 did not pass the smog test even though all the recommended defective parts were all replaced with a new one. Our friend auto mechanic tried very hard to find what’s wrong and couldn’t find any. On my way along Imperial Highway I found this All tune & Lube automotive shop that do smog check and repair . I asked few questions and was happy with their answers. I was more confident that this shop will be honest and able to fix my car when I saw the sign of AAA recognition of the shop. I also learned several things  watching on the tv screen tips about cars and how to take care of  it while in the waiting area. I was even more happy finding out that I can get discount being an AAA member. My husband told his friend who also have a problem  on his car passing the smog test and asked for this’s shops address . I highly recommend this shop for their honesty and expertise. They’re always very busy but the staff and the owner that I met that day are very nice and accommodating. They even gave me and my husband some more tips about cars that I never experienced in the many auto shops that I’ve been to.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>Great place to go to repair your car very honest. You will be happy here. 3 years warranty almost everything they install Parts and LABOR. They will tell you over the phon or in person up front what kind of part they going to put in. They are open every day accept National Hollidays. 8 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday. Saturday and Sunday 9 am to 4 pm. Even they will wait for you if you will be late 30 to 45 min to close. You will go here with confidence that your job will be down properly. They do finance if you don’t have money to pay the accept all major cc, and they do accept Firestone and Goodyear credit card. They even have a Loner Car to offer if you car must be there for long. Wow I was there for couple of issue with my car. Very happy with them.

No AC in the waiting room on a 94° afternoon. Not my idea of a fun time. That said, they were very quick. Roughly 30 minutes from the time I walked in to when I left, with two people ahead of me. Found a coupon online for them which made it the best price around. Prices are posted in the corner of the "cash office."< /Text>

Worst service I've ever experienced. Charged me $800 to replace my ignition system that failed less then a month later leaving me stranded after an exhaustive 10hr shift.My brother who is not a certified mechanic might i add replaced the cap and rotor for a fraction of their cost...... I do not recommend. If you want it done right ask your brother before you come here!< /Text>

<text>Just found this place online and printed the coupon and drove out to do errands then stopped by, parked and went inside, I was quickly greeted and asked what I needed.  I informed him I needed a regular smog test and he asked me to step into his office where he then asked for my Registration paperwork.  I pulled it out from my purse along with the coupon and presented it to him.  He took all the information and a technician came and took my key.  As I was signing, dating and filling in the time on the repair order, another customer walked in and I went to sit in the waiting area.  I glanced at the magazine selection and overheard him talking with the new customer, then the technician walked in and had my keys in his hand.  OH MY!  this does not look good.  I was finished, now way!  Way!  I had never had a smog test so fast in all my life.  I promptly paid, no checks, ATM is OK.  So I whipped out the old ATM and I was finished.  Handed my keys and out the door after thanking him and wishing him a Blessed Day!  Oh did I mention the total cost with the certificate filed with the DMV was $30.00.   So if you want wonderful treatment and fast service, as I was finished in less than 10 minutes, not to mention a great price (I could hardly believe it myself)  by all means come to ALL LUBE & TUNE on Imperial in La Habra.  It is on the north side of the street for those who have never been by there before, I drove from Whittier.  Amazing and well worth your time to go there as they truly respect your time.  Thanks All Tune & Lube for a wonderful experience getting my car smog tested.< /text><Name>Mike Melcher</Name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
1999 ford f250 super duty, 4x4 7.3 turbo diesel

I recently had the front axel seals replaced on the above listed vehicle on or about Nov 06, 2018 at ALL LUBE AND TUNE, 521 W. Imperial hwy, La Habra.    After having a disagreement with the cost, they performed the axel seal replacement.  I drove the truck home.  The next day I went to drive truck and noticed the front axels were again leaking and worse. I returned to the shop and explained the truck was leaking and worse.  They put the truck on the rack, looked at it and sprayed it with break cleaner.  The mechanic told me to take it to car wash and wash the axels.  I told the mechanic owner I was leaving to Arizona.  The owner said I would be ok.  On 11/29 or 30 I drove to Arizona, approx 290 miles.  Upon arrival I noticed the wheel wells and parts of the engine compartment covered with an oil substance.  I looked under the truck and found the axels severely leaking.  I went to a local shop and they put the truck on a rack  needless to say oil was dripping from the axels.  They repaired the truck and found the seals were not properly installed.  When I returned to ALL TUNE AND LUBE and explained that I got stuck and had to have the truck fixed, the owner said they would not reimburse me for the repairs.  He told me that I had to go through NAPA but was not provided any paperwork regarding warranty.
I found this shop through Repairpal, saw that they had a pretty good ratings, and saw where the worl is  guaranteed.  Needless to say I am extremely disappointed.<//Review>

Improperly sealing axles are not a common occurrence and we wish it didn't happen at an inopportune time. With that said, we would like to give you a free oil change if you give us another try. Thank you."}< /resp>

<user_name>Vera Dukic</user_name><Text>My 2nd experience dealing with the shop, and they did a great job of diagnosing and repairing electrical problems with my 14 year old Honda Accord. The fee of diagnosis was applied to the repair...unlike a couple of other places which had a separate diagnosis fee. Additionally, I got my car smogged (best price I found in my local area) and an oil change during the same visit...so it saved me some time too.</Text>< response>

<Review>Went there today and was in n out in about 10 min.  Mo was the one who helped us and he was great.  He gave us a great price and was super friendly.  There was nothing sketchy about this place at all.  Very comfortable environment, with cable tv in the waiting room.  I loved that they all spoke great english, unlike other places where they have 1 guy who kind of speaks english.  Get your car done here!</Review>< pics>

<Text>I don't like putting negative reviews but I want everyone to be aware of my experience.
They do good quality of work here there's no doubt about that, but when I got my son's car back there was a huge dent in the lower driver side door. Unfortunately we didn't notice it until we got home because when we picked up the car the technician had to move the car upfront and he had the door open.
I spoke with Don and he told me to take it to his preferred auto body shop to see if they could tell us what caused the damage. The auto body said it appears the door was slightly opened and a jack caused the damage. I went back and spoke with Don and he refuses to pay for it. He said they don't use floor jacks.
A repair that cost me $400 is now costing me $900 since I have to pay for the damage.
If you take your car here please inspect your car before leaving.</Text><userid>107485669251606843917</userid><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

Good service, wife to truck in for smog check. Check engine light was on. They could have taken her money to fix it but told her it was probably under warranty and she should take it to the dealer.<//text>

My most recent visit was unsatisfactory got a quote on a repair it was outrageous 😳 took to another shop quoted a much lower price when I told them what pro tech said the issue was, as it turned out pro tech was wrong in their diagnosis of my truck and what was wrong with and it was totally different issue..still paid a reasonable price at other shop. I will not go back to pro tech and would not recommend them to anyone! also I have spoken to other patrons of Don's pro tech and they have not had good experiences. just saying beware and get a second opinion if you go there.</Review>

<text>Took my car to dons to get a diagnostic for a warranty company, they took apart the entire engine and pulled everything from the clutch to the ac for no reason. Went to get my engine and parts back and the whole thing was in shambles and unorganized. They  Lost many parts including my catted down pipe (not a cheap part on my specific vehicle). When I finally had time to start rebuilding my engine and go through my parts a few months later, I call them asking where my parts went and they say that don might’ve “taken it home”. I paid them 1,200 to take apart my engine and lose some expensive parts. Their unprofessionalism and lack of knowledge on my specific vehicle cost me $900 dollars on my current rebuild.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I cant say enough good about this place. I have been dealing with Don since the early 2000s. He has always done great work. I only take my cars here for smogs. They always get me in quick and are reasonably priced. Very good customer service.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Visitation date: mid August. Great customer service, they were able to help diagnose and give my husband and I proper information regarding the status of our car trouble. Thank you Roy who helped us check in with our 8am appointment and kept in contact with us throughout the day of the on goings with our car. Roy was severely understaffed that morning as 4-5 more customers poured in right when we showed up, but he handled everyone with great customer service in a timely manner and acknowledged as they came in and waited. When it came time to picking up our car, the owner Don himself took wonderful care of us in explaining the car situation with tact and expertise. These folks are trained professionals and did not try to upsell or misinform us. I really appreciated that as I'm very weary of those situations when mechanics just want to add more services to your bill when it wasn't the initial idea. I highly recommend if you're from out of town and aren't sure where to look in Tehachapi. Also don't forget to call ahead and make the appointment. Luckily we called on a Thurs mid afternoon and were able to schedule it the very next day Fri at 8am. Hands down, 5 star service.</Text>< pics>

When I first moved out to this area I bounced around between a few automotive mechanic shops. Not completely satisfied with the first places I went to, I eventually gave Don's a try. And I must say I have been consistently satisfied with the work that they have performed. And since then Don's is the only place I have been taking my vehicle for maintenance issues.</review>

Was told it would take 30 minutes for a smog, and ended up waiting over a hour and a half. For some reason in my experience, customers don’t get helped in the order they walk in either. Would definitely recommend going out of town instead.< /Review>

< review>
Everyone dreads the inevitable with one's vehicle... that is, a strange noise from beneath the hood, or a never-before-seen light appear in the dash board. In my case, the vehicle didn't start. Dead as a 10-year-old corpse! A cornucopia of free advice came from all directions: "It's the Alternator!" "It's the switch to the Alternator!" All this was dreaded, of course, because of the costs involved.
When I had my Silverado towed to Don's, he said it may only be the battery and, sure enough!, it turned out to simply be the battery in the face of all the bad advice I got.
Honesty is what we dream of when we take our vehicles in for service.  And honesty is what we pay for, as well.
I got both at Don's last week!

I normally perform my own auto repairs but due to a number of constraints I needed to reach out to a professional. After researching my local options I selected DPT and I am glad I did. They were receptive to my diagnosis of the issue and confirmed it. I was given the cost and agreed to it. At no point was I told I needed anything extra which is a common scam in many shops. The front office staff are courteous and communicative. My truck is back  on the road with a tip of my hat to the mechanic that did all the work. A hearty thanks to Don and his team!< /text>

<review>My friend was traveling thru and broke down outside of Tehapachi and had her car towed to their shop. They made a terrible situation great, she was stranded and supposed to be at her sisters graduation. Jenna and the rest of the staff took great care of her and had her back on the road the next day. Didn't take advantage of a female traveler or sell her anything she didn't need. They went above and beyond the ordinary to accomodate her. I would recommend everyone to use this shop and wish they're were more people like them in this industry.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>I have a camper, a Class C with a Ford E-450 Chassis.  I made an appointment for a Saturday at 8 am, get it done and get on with the day.  I'd had that camper smog checked there before, and have two other cars that I take there for smog tests, 8 am on Saturdays.   I've been taking my cars there for the smog checks for years. So I showed up today, there was a guy with a truck in front of me for a smog, no big deal, I can walk down to the bakery for some coffee.  But then the guy behind the counter tells me that they "Don't do campers until after 3 pm".  When I made the appointment the lady who answered the phone didn't say that, and I've had my camper done there before, always at 8 am.  What really happened is that he wanted to get the walk-ins done first, and blow off the regular customer, because he figured I'd just drop it off.

Nope.  Not going back again.  I even drove past the place an hour later and not a car in the smog bay to be seen.  I'll take my business elsewhere.  Poor service in a small town and the word spreads fast.</Text><Time>1489862745394</Time><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>They were great! We had an item in our smog device go out and it was making a terrible noise. We thought something worse happened. But, they immediately diagnosed it and actually had the part there.  Service was A+. But the part was made of plastic and broke again later. This same part, I've replaced 4 times. All other places I went to have it replaced always had to order the part and I had to wait and wait. They were top notch!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Broke down just outside of tehachapi.  The owner Don will forever be my mechanic hero. He was straight forward and honest. Fixed what needed to be fixed to get back to Vegas and suggested I do the work here as it would be cheaper.  Don't  find many people in the world like Don.< /Text>

Don and his crew seem like a pretty straight up group of people. Not only did they do the job I paid them to do, they also looked into another issue that I had for free since they were already going to be working on it. If there is ever an honest group of mechanics these guys are probably it.< /review>

Don's is Tehachapi at it's best. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable and will go out of their way to help.  I've been a customer for many years and never had a bad experience there, I recommend them to all my friends.< /Text>

Fair and honest. That is just the only description I can give Don and his crew.
For me there's nothing worse than having a mechanical problem on a vehicle when I'm making a road trip. Being somewhere unfamiliar and having to rely on the luck of the draw is just downright miserable feeling. My truck transmission started acting up after pulling the grade from Bakersfield I had to stop and tehachapi. I called around and the nearest Ford dealer in Mojave wouldn't even see me for a week even though I emphasize to them on the road away from home. Based on a search and some reviews I called Don. They got me in straight away and Don himself spent a good hour plus trying to analyze my situation and figure it out. In the end they determined that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and sent me on my way and didn't even charge me.  they could have done anything they wanted as I was at their mercy and I thank them so much. An honest man and an honest shop!!!!!
Thank you Don!!!!</Text>

<Review>I always went here to get work done. I had taken my car in 3x and they would diagnose it and said one time it was overflow of coolant, when my coolant hadn't been filled for 3 months. Long story short the last time I took it their because same thing was happening, he, meaning Don, was very rude to me and not helpful at all. Now I will not take any of my family members vehicles thier for work!!!< /Review>< pictures>

Very bad service... my neighbor took his Expedition in to DPT to work on it. He did get it back the same day when they were closing, but it was worse off when he got it back. That's the only reason i gave one star and it didn't give you an option to give no stars, otherwise I wouldn't of even given a star. When he went to picked it up and started it, it wasn't fixed. It had the same problem as when he brought it in for them to fix it in the first place. Everyone had already left for the day, so he couldn't tell them at that time and proceeded to go pickup his daughter from work, which is only a few miles away and and then drove home, which is only a couple more miles away. The owner Don the owner wasn't the one who worked on it, another one of his mechanics worked on it. When he brought it back the very next day to ket them know and to fix it, they made excuses why their still was a problem and blamed him, as well as telling him there were more problems. The Expedition was worse then when he brought it in to them to work on. And they were going to charge him more money to fix it. I feel they shouldn't of charged him, since it was their fault. Should of just fixed it and keep DPT'S good name. First of all, this is a family that doesn't have a lot of money to begin with and this is their only car. They don't have money to get it fixed now. This type of thing angers me. I will complain to the better business bureau, the city of Tehachapi and whoever I can to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else. NEVER EVER TAKE YOUR CAR HERE, unless you have the owner Don work on it and make sure you get a diagnostic tests first to make sure exactly what's wrong with it prior to having DPT do any work. As a matter of fact, the mechanic who worked on our neighbors Expedition said he would do a diagnostic tests first before he'd work on it. But the next day he said he never said that. First, if a automotive mechanic business has a diagnostic machine, they should alwaus do one on the vehicle and then call and let the customer know exactly what's wrong with the vehicle and how much it will costs, before any work is done PERIOD! Obviously it wasn't done. Don, you might want to take a look at this mechanic, because it seems you do good work and this mechanic is making your business look bad. I'm sorry, but I'm very disappointed...<//Text>

I went in on 8/22/16 because I got a letter saying my registration would be suspended because my car had not passed smog. After the front people investigated, they determined my car had in fact NOT passed smogged but I was charged the $51 for the smog test (pass or don't pay is their motto).  Not only did I have to wait for over an hour because no one there can give a refund except for the owner (Don) and he was busy in the back but I was also treated rudely (by Don) when he finally came out to help me... instead of apologizing for the mistake (which I can absolutely understand) his first words were "where's the receipt" even though his employees verified I had indeed paid. When I tried to explain it was in the car, in LA and that's why I couldn't just bring the car in to have it re-smogged he continued to be rude saying they don't issue refunds without the receipt and placed the blame on me as if I made the mistake. He also said "I don't know who it is that can't read because it clearly says on here that it didn't pass because it wasn't ready", not that it matters but Don was the one that gave me the smog paper and said it passed and he processed my payment. I even asked if it would get electronically sent to the DMV and he said "no, because I was taking it off of non-op and the registration was late so I needed the paper copy to give to the DMV. Even after being treated so rudely by Don, I was nice took my refund and left. I have been going to this smog place for years and when I owned a business I took all my service trucks there. I have taken a minimum of 2 vehicles a year there to get smogged and they have now lost my business for life. I will never take or recommend this shop again, not because of the mistake, but because of the treatment I received because of THEIR mistake.  All it would have taken to keep me as a customer was a sincere apology instead of being treated as an inconvenience.< /review>

Waited for a smog that could not be completed by this b business. After waiting 2 hours I had to take it elsewhere. In which they informed me I was lied to by this company for the reason why the smog could not be completed fully.</Text>

<Text>There were 3 people at the counter.
I was exploring trading in my 7 seat passenger metris for a tesla S.
They could not deliver an S till July and would rob me blind on the trade in.

Looks like a no deal!</Text><name>Francis Schwanauer< /name><user>109203478146003956526</user><GmapID>0x80e826b317cc3bc5:0x62aab850662c4efc< /GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Don’t take your Tesla here for service. I purchased a brand new X and it immediately needed service for paint defects, condensation in the tail lamps, and a defective seal in the falcon window that caused air to come into the cabin. They kept the car for 2 weeks and fixed only the paint defects. The paint defects weren’t even fixed by Tesla, they send it to a 3rd party body shop for paint. They scheduled me for an additional mobile service to get the tail lamp fixed... and then tried to say the “wind noise” was normal turbulence.... Bruh, I could clearly feel the cold @$$ air coming in through the falcon window. Basically they didn’t do $hit and then pawned me off to their mobile service team. I got my car back dirty AF too bc it had obviously been sitting out in the rain the past couple weeks. Thanks Tesla Agoura Hills. /s<//review><user_name>Ethen Yi< /user_name>< Rate>

Ms. Sydney showed wonderful customer services. Super friendly representative. Answered all my questions. Gave me appropriate referrals for body shop services. I didn't wait too long to have my turn @ the service center. All COVID compliant and friendly. Definitely a 5 star services in the West San Fernando Valley community. Make sure to stop by and say hi. Ms. Sydney is a great communicator with lots of talents.<//text>

<text>I came to the Service center to get a quote and order some parts. The person from the Parts department was out for lunch, so I got their email address. After I sent an email to it, I got a response saying that any letters from the domain other than tesla.com or authorized addresses get rejected. I doubt the guy at the front desk did not know that, and yet he gave me the email address that was not working for the customers. I emailed the service center directly and asked to forward my letter to the parts department. Never heard from either of them. Total waste of my time dealing with this particular service center.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80e826b317cc3bc5:0x62aab850662c4efc<//GmapID></record>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I went in for a Tesla drive of the Model S, which I had scheduled for 3:00 PM, and I actually arrived 15 minutes early as stated on the reservation email. I get there, and walk in, and am not helped by anybody for 15 minutes until I have to go up and ask someone for help. They tell me that the car is currently out being driven but should be back in 10 minutes and that I can go wait in my car, so I do that. Time goes by, and I am now waiting there for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, until after about an hour past my scheduled test drive, a car drives up and parks. The people go inside and are brought to the car which I WAS SUPPOSED TO DRIVE within 2 minutes of entering. All of the workers would walk by my car and purposefully not look at me as they knew that they had messed up big time. This is completely unacceptable and I most definitely suggest never going to get a Tesla here, as you will not be helped for hours and will be ignored. I would give this 0/5 stars if possible<//Text>< Time>

Worst customer service. For a luxury car you expect  a 5 star service. You can’t get a hold of anybody.  They don’t text you back when the car is ready. They’re Uber app doesn’t work. I had to pay my own Uber.  I love the car but will not get another Tesla just because of horrible service!< /Review>

I picked up my new Tesla Model 3 on a Saturday in Marina Del Rey, and while driving home I made one stop and my new Model 3 became inoperable with numerous braking and steering warnings flashing. I had it towed to Tesla Service in Agoura in the late afternoon on a Saturday and have to commend Lydia for exceptional service. She knew I was pretty distraught. She immediately let me know they would do everything possible to get to my car by Monday and communicate with me via text. Sure enough, I was alerted that my car was ready for pick up on Sunday around 2p. Lydia left a note explaining my situation to the techs and service manager, and this team there delivered. Thank you all!</text>

I really do feel like these guys go 'above and beyond.'  As an example: I took my 2013 S in for service, and was given a fully loaded 2016 with auto-pilot, as a loaner, no charge. I almost wish they hadn't given me a newer car as now the eventual return to my 2013 will be a bit of a downer. Hmm... maybe this is a sales strategy? Whatever. Works for me.< /text>

<review>I have taken my Tesla in several times over the last few months for service and repairs. The service manager, Ryan, and the service advisors Connor and Jesse, have gone out of their way to make sure than my car was repaired in a timely manner. They always kept me informed on the progress of the work, and when the car would be finished.  They help redefine what a car repair facility should be. I recommend taking your Tesla here for any work needed.<//review>< pics>

We cannot thank Ryan Paterson (service manager) enough for coming to our rescue at Big Bear mountain. We drove our Tesla up to the mountain, and did not realize that our hotel and the other few places to charge up did not have any cables (lesson learned to always carry the cables when traveling long distances). We had roughly 20 miles left and over 50 miles to the nearest supercharger. We were feeling completely hopeless and just as we were ready to leave... Ryan appeared right next to us. He graciously offered his charging cables for us to use all day while we skied, and just asked for us to return them to a service center convenient to us. He insisted we are all a part of the "Tesla family". We cannot tell you how much we appreciated your kindness, and willingness to help. Thank you!!!<//text>

Was here to install my front & rear license plate which took less than 30mins.  Jon was excellent, he took the initiative to add windsheild fluid, checked the tire pressure, added more air, & cleaned the front end prior to the installation.  Just make sure to Check IN with the front counter.  There were some confusion & my wife thought we’ve been helped.......

***Highly recommend this place!!***</review>

I can't do that , its also not fair for the Tesla owers like myself to have no access to anyone . It is my second Tesla, it is being more and more challenging to get in touch with anyone over the phone. Seems to me like they don't have an equivalent custoemer service to the amount of clients they have now. It has been a frustrating tesla owership time. Hope that will change soon.<//Text>< pictures>

Upon arrival I had to deal with submitting an insurance claim (usually done by service center), paying out of pocket and now having to chase my insurance carrier for the reimbursement. This coupled with Tesla having a monopoly on the windshield supplier, so no other provider such as Safelite can compete or help, makes this the absolute worst experience ever.</Review><Rating>1< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80e826b317cc3bc5:0x62aab850662c4efc<//Gmap_id>< resp>

Great dishes! We had the All-you-can-eat and there was a lot of selection. Service could be better, but food and atmosphere was great!<//review>

< Review>
Just had lunch here for the first time, and loved it. It was 3pm, so very quiet. The all you can eat is a fantastic deal. And more importantly, the food is excellent and the staff is really warm and friendly.  Sometimes at all you can eat sushi restaurants, the quality can be dicey at best, and the staff act annoyed when you order more. Not at ALL the case here. Especially loved their Haru and rainbow rolls. Will absolutely be back.</Review>

The owner Marin is awesome. They have all you can eat. Their special tools are awesome, try the Everything roll, Ninja roll, what the Heck roll and their  Tempura Calamari. They also have 3 or 5 Sake tasters<//text>

<text>Traditional Sushi in a comfortable and friendly atmosphere.  The all-you-can-eat sushi deal is not to be missed.  Sushi is served in traditional fashion with rice at body temperature and fish slightly cool.  Staff is friendly, informative and willing to help guests with any need.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Chicken Udon soup has been consistently the past three years. I found out they make it fresh everyday.
During the flu season I give my children this soup and it miraculously makes them feel better. I believe the ginger helps with nausea and the noodles are nice and thick that they don’t have to eat too much.
I’ve never rated restaurants, but this place is the only place I’d ever consider having soup or sushi. I moved from Redondo Beach, and believe me the sushi has always been great.< /Text>

<text>I showed up with five other people. The sushi was good nothing to brag about but the entire meal took over three hours. There was only one chef and it appears the chef and his wife run it. We were charged automatic gratuity. Given the opportunity to go there again I'd rather sit in my car for two hours and eat gas station sushi. At the end the result is the same I'd regret the decision and wonder why I put myself through it.< /text><resp>None< /resp></record>

I would not suggest happy hour"All You Can Eat", $26.00 not worth it. Loaded with rice fish was questionable, lack of flavor and freshness. Both my friend and I stomach was bloated. I eat sushi often at least once a week from Whole Foods Market it is better.</Text>

This place was great, one of those small and more modest places but we got our food surprisingly fast (they weren’t very busy) and it was absolutely delicious! Will visit again for sure and highly recommend.<//Text>

Service was excellent, and sushi was very good.  To the reviewer who said the sushi was warm, the rice is supposed to be warm, not cold and the fish shouldn't be slightly cool, but not cold.

The rice to sashimi (fish) ratio is too much, but I cut the portion of rice in half and ate that with my tempura and shumai.  So keep that in mind.  I'm pretty sure like other places, that you can't take off the fish and leave the rice.  I didn't do it, so I don't know for a fact but its a safe assumption.

Service was outstanding, and the main reason I'm going back.  Food was good, but service made me feel like an old time regular, and they were SUPER busy, too.

Safe bet to go get sushi if you're in the area.  I enjoyed it very much, and food was solid.<//review>

Came for the all you can eat sushi only to find they no longer offer all ypu can eat sushi. So we still stayed to enjoy a boat where we could pick our own rolls, sashimi and sushi. The owner told us that we were not allowed to order eel as our choices because they didnt have enough I guess. She was still mad about the last time I had gone for the all you can eat where we ordered several eel rolls, as they were our favorite. That time we had  received the worst customer service due to our large consumption of sushi. I was hesitant to go this last time and thought she wouldnt remember me, but i have one of those unforgettable faces i suppose. Either way, I do NOT recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great, friendly service.< /Text>

Go to the desert often and this time we were looking for some sushi minus the long waiting time. Found this cool little spot not far from the house. Have only been once but will be back.< /Review>

very good food. selection is a little more authentic since it is owned/managed by a Japanese couple. the koroke is amazing and they have a good sake selection. i don't know where the other reviews are from, this restaurant just opened less than 2 weeks ago. it's where Joe's Sushi used to be by Men's Wearhouse and the pub.<//Text>

<Text>Haru Sushi is the BEST!!!!-- and this is the best quality/ Value and Service u could get  in the whole coachella valley   -  i love this place  - try it been coming here for years  -  i really don't know what these other paid reviews a talking about .. i never write reviews .. but i had to back this restaurant up. they deserve a good representation of what work they do - service is always good - sometimes i do wait  and its rare  ..because its super packed -  the fish is fresh and delicious - i drive 30 mins for this place  and never have i regret it.<//Text>< Pictures>

We were excited when we arrived but  extremely disappointed when we left. The service was pathetic, all the staff we encountered seemed to be inept at best. We ordered all you can eat sushi and waited 2 hours. The place seemed crowded and understaffed. The fish was not fresh and tasted old and rubbery.  I think the freshest thing we tasted this evening was the salad.  I regret to say that we could not recommend this establishment to any of our friends.</Review>

was very rude to the people next to me and when I said something the guy behind the bar said you don't have to eat here. so I pay and left haven't been back ........ he told the people next to me as they were sitting down this wasn't a del taco or a fast food place so make sure you tip. I was pissed that he just said to them. by the way they were not kids more like like early 30s well dress and Mexican distant. This place shouldn't be open if its gonna treat people like that and the fact that he got mad when I said you shouldn't say that to someone cause of how they look. and no he didn't say its not cause of that. all he said after that you don't have to eat.< /Review>

The food was decent, although alot of the sushi was warm. I even asked if their serving table was chilled to keep it all cold. Everything from the rice to the cream cheese was warm. It was stomach upsetting. Unfortunatly. Hopefully in the future itll be better.<//review>

<review>My friends and I had an awesome time here last night.  Brandon our limo driver suggested it and brought us here.  The fish was really fresh, and the rice was not too soft like I have found at other "all you eat" style places.  The Gyoza we ordered wa not greasy and the Tempura was not overbattered.  It wa a really awesome experience, and though we were not near any oceans, I would give this place a first rate!  I eat a lot of Sushi in BC and we are always skeptical of places in shopping centers, but DO NOT HESITATE to enjoy this one!< /review>< user_id>

<Review>Best and only place I go too, I'm treated as if I was home theyre. All custom sushi rolls are AMAZING!! I even get NY own special chop sticks for being a regular. Never been treated less than perfect. Price is perfect, and Thomas the owner/sushi chef is fun to just relax and talk too. Thank k you haru for coming to the desert and bringing the best sushi and hospitality. Read the comment below.,, so rediculous, from past experience as a server, some people just think that they are to be treated like royalty will talk down to nice people when they act rude and offensive. Anyways love HARU EVERYONE SHOULD EAT THERE!!!! GO! IM GOING THERE RIGHT NOW LOL.

(Translated by Google) I went to 11:30 immediately after opening. Since it was my first time, I wanted to see the situation from the outside of the store, but there was nothing outside that could tell me the contents and the amount, so I entered with a bit. Even though it is a Japanese restaurant, there is no Japanese notation, and I was relieved that there was a lunch menu with a reasonable price of about $ 11, but the taste is not good or impossible? Which one is impossible? I enjoyed a set meal of Tonkatsu and Tempura, but the cutlet is very thin, whether it's about 1 cm thick or not, and it's fried too much. There was no shrimp in tempura, but it was delicious. The miso soup that the astragalus was rushed into and came out was also good. Isn't there a California roll that contains 4 pieces? Should I ask for sushi?

開店直後11:30に行きました。初めてだったので店の外から様子を見ようと思ったのですが、外には内容や金額をうかがえるものはなく、かけで入りました。日本食レストランなのに日本語表記は一切なく、不安感たっぷりの中、ランチメニューがあり＄11位のそこそこの金額でほっとしましたが味は可もなく不可もなく？どっちかと言うと不可？トンカツと天ぷらの定食をたのみましたが、カツが厚さ1センチいくかいかないかの極薄で揚げすぎ感たっぷり。天ぷらはエビこそありませんが美味しかったです。レンゲが突っ込まれて出てきたみそ汁もまあまあでした。4つ入ってたカリフォルニアロールも可もなく不可もなく？寿司を頼めば良かったのかな？<//Text>

<Text>So I had to edit the review because I forgot to add  the weed review so my review is a 3 due to the fact that there weed and concentrate (white THCA) is good. Customer service was ok but that because I think I scared them since I had shade and black ppe mask. Sorry maybe next time I come back it might be better I hope.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd27311b0c0f65:0xa1b81cf9e2a31165<//gmapID></record>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>They cut hair pretty good overall. Only con to this location is that they normally run appointments only making walk-ins impossible. It’s been several times I gone in (during different times of the day) when the barbers are behind they’re appointment schedules in cutting hair which is unfortunate for any walk in looking for a cut.< /Text>< pictures>

It's a fairly small shop that spacializes in military cuts. Appointments are a good idea during restrictive covid 19 times. Parking can be iffy, and getting back into traffic is even more so. Prices are moderate, and service is friendly & speedy.<//text>

I will definitely be going back to this place. I left with a great haircut and facial hair trim for a reasonable price. They're also very friendly and make good conversation.<//review>

Came in nobody was waiting in line but somehow 16 people are ahead of me. Never coming back again. Horrible system.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Date>1531430847575<//Date><rate>5<//rate><review>I would just like to take the time to say thank you for my haircut,  I don’t always leave reviews but I felt it necessary to leave one this time.  I give a five star review for these qualities: 1. They have the upmost respect for military. 2. Cleanliness is at its finest. 3. They do not sacrifice quality over speed. 4. Affordable prices for great quality haircuts. Visiting from North Dakota to get one of the finest haircuts was a true privilege. Thank you for the great service and I look forward to having another impeccable haircut at your barber shop next time I’m in town.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Sat there for close to an hour before any of the barbers said anything about a sign in process. There wasn’t anything posted anywhere to sign in. That should definitely be asked of as soon as you walk in.< /Review><UserId.>116194431426488092115< /UserId.><rate>2<//rate>< Pictures>

Best barber shop I've found in the Camp Pendleton area. I got a bad haircut last week, from a different shop. The barber at Evolution took his time to listen to me and gave me exactly what I wanted. The fade is perfect too. Highly recommended.<//Review>

I really like this place but their hours are not consistent. At least they are very friendly. Their stated closing time is 8pm but this is the second time I came at 7:30pm and was told they were closed even though the door sign and lit OPEN sign said open. There was 1 person waiting so not like they were super busy.  So I think they just decide if they are closed whenever they feel like it or business is slow. Haircuts are cheap and good quality so I continue to come here but their lazy hours drives me nuts. Another review mentioned they do the same for opening time. So as long as your not close to the opening or closing your probably good.</Text>

Took my son for a cut and I wasn't happy with his haircut at all. I wanted it tapered and the lady acted like she didn't understand what that meant. Her attitude was as big as her head too! His hair ended up all different lengths. I wanted a comb over w a line and it tapered w a fade going up! Is that too hard to understand?! It shouldn't be when it's your supposed trained profession....This is what I get for not going to Heritage Barber shop. Definitely not worth your time or money going to this place!< /Text>

A vivint male representative just came to my door at 9 pm, on a Friday, to talk about what security system we have and how much we spend on it. Scary scary scary time to come to the door as a door to door salesman. Very unprofessional and makes me feel unsafe.< /text>

<Text>Vivint is not too pricey so that's one of the reasons I like about them. When getting everything installed they're in and out within 1-1.5 hours. I like it so far. Also it only records when someone is at the driveway or doorbell front pooch to catch porch pirates. That's what I wanted. It doesn't connect to the TV to see everything happening but I could see it on the panel on the wall and on the app of my phone. I could armed and disarmed my alarm on my phone or the panel and within the app while I'm not home I could monitor my home from my phone. Also from what I heard the monthly fee doesn't go up for service after everything is pay off like for the equipment. When the equipment is paid off. All I have to pay monthly is the service fee which is affordable. I strongly recommend Vivint.< /Text></record>

From the sales people (Parker) to the installer (Aaron) and trainees with Parker, everyone was professional, respectful and all were great communicators!  They listened, answered my many questions and made the whole process clear and simple!  I’m very happy with my choice of Vivint for securing my home and will recommend them to others!</Review>

Do yourself a favor and never use Vivint. Just look at the horror stories on the BBB website. The tech lied to me about the contract and their equipment is junk.</review>

<review>Vivint technician was very knowledgeable and efficient. I wasn’t even on his schedule for the day and he worked me in. I really appreciate him going the extra mile for me. The customer service rep, Tevan, was just as awesome. He made sure that my house got serviced the same day and he stayed in contact with me. So far, I am very pleased with Vivint.< /review>< Pics>

Experience from consultation to installation was seamless and professional. Answered any questions I had without hesitation or burdensome tones. Consulting rep was clear and concise. Installers were respectful and practiced current times protocols. Set up and walk through was impressive. Great experience for me< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This is what I had been wishing for! I was impressed by the knowledge this representative had about the system. He  answered all my questions and succeeded In getting the financial assistance so I  could get it installed the following morning. He understood my unique situation
The ones that came to install the following day was  very well experienced in their own right too. They understood my situation. They knew what to do and weren't afraid to do work!. These 3 people are an asset for whomever they work for. All are friendly and very much a champ at what they do. A very good experience for sure. I would recommend these 3 people to anyone and the surveillance  system is awesome! The sound is clea
r and the pictures fantastic. Not hard to operate at all. I love the doorbell. I am truly a homeowner now:) very pleased all the way around.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I love the camera system. Unlike the Ring System  you can adjust the alerts, so your phone is not blowing up all the time. I dont like the lock because the numbers do not light up so using the door lock (number access) is difficult. Follow up is not good though the poor sales staff is under such pressure to deliver sales numbers.</Review>

The equipment we had was good. The service from Vivint was good as well, especially when we cancelled the service with our 30 day ROR.
4 stars.

The sales and installation process, from what ever third party outfit they use, is not good. They over promise and under deliver. They quoted a price and when the bill came, it was higher than quoted. The installation is rushed and as fast as possible with little to no instructions. Additionally, we experienced that extra equipment was added to our account when it was not asked for, received, installed or noted on our customer facing paperwork.
1 star

Buyer be aware! Their contract is a 6 year commitment with a line of credit for you to pay for the equipment. Make sure you know what you are getting into and request a 30 day ROR, or you are stuck.

When you average it out,  its 2.5 stars, but I'll give them 3 since I was able to cancel and get my money back.</Review>

<text>The installation technician gets an overall 5 star. But 2 starts lost for the sales person who promised a different equipment rate but billed for the full amount for all smart home features. Did not even include all the equipment discussed. The only reason I went with Vivint was because the technician Sean  tried to help me to his best ability and their monitoring service is good.

We have had the worst experience with trying to get a technician out. After about and hour on the phone flipping breakers and climbing ladders and what not ....and all for them to schedule a tech to come out. Fast forward 2 weeks..day of they call and cancel....put us out another 2 weeks....to yet again cancel  DAY OF...Called to talk to someone...was "being transferred to a manager" and click.....2xs.
I understand the 1 star rating....as we are on hold again for the 3rd time....so frustrating.<//Review>

<Text>The representative was very informative regarding services and equipment.  The tech was wonderful and worked swiftly to accommodate my schedule due to late evening installation. She was also very knowledgeable about her profession and informative.  Kiudos to the tech as she was very flexible with installation. She is an asset to your company. As well as Henry convincing me to switch from ADT! Thanks Vivint!<//Text>< Pictures>

<date>1596768276118<//date><username>brandon atchison< /username><Text>From Raúl to Justin and Grant... the staff at Vivint is amazing. After agreeing to their contract, they were able to install a wall panel, doorbell camera and all the window / door / motion sensors in UNDER 30 MINUTES. I was in a crunch to get to work on time and didn't think they could do it, they assured me they could and they did. And then included training me on my new home security system and phone app, which where both incredibly easy to use and better than what I had before with ADT. I would recommend this company and their products to anyone. You won't be disappointed.

Every person I’ve dealt with so far has been extremely helpful, responsive and most of all, made me feel comfortable. Thank you Johnathan, Jake and Amber. I can’t believe it was just last night you guys came to my door and everything was already installed by 1pm today! I feel much more connected with my home when I’m away now, thanks again!</text>

<Review>Vivint smart home security is top notch. My wife and I recently purchased our home and we’re expecting our first child soon. We’ve had several home security companies out and we just didn’t feel comfortable with the services. When Jed approached me about Vivint I had no clue about this company. Once he went over the services I was sold. The technician Hunter was extremely professional and confident. He said you and your wife will love this product and he is absolutely right. It’s not too complicated, it’s smooth and very accessible. My wife and I love the options that comes with our phones via an app. Overall, I was just pleased with the service and the installation process. Hunter explained his every move, he kept saying watch this you guys will love this feature while loading up the cameras. He was an entertainer while installing our system. This guys was amazing. Vivint hired a solid guy when they placed him on their team. I can honestly say, in my lifetime I’ve had a lot of services done Hunter for sure is in my top 2. I’m impressed with what we have so far.

My wife and I are safe now in our new home.

Thanks Vivint, I truly feel you guys have our backs.

The sales rep was really nice but he lied about a few things. He told me I would have 1 months to try it out and if I didn’t like it I could give it back. I called Vivint to cancel some of the products I got and they told me I only had three days to cancel, which is not what the rep had told me. The sales rep also told me I wouldn’t have to pay the first month and that was a lie. I called Vivint and the guy told me he would get back to me and never did.< /text>

<Name>John Holt<//Name><time>1591546972679<//time><rating>1</rating><review>I was blind sided by Vivint sales rep when I pulled up to my house. I had no clue who/what/why he was there? He led me to believe Vivint owned the alarm system in my house And that my control panel was defective and it caused fires in other homes and said that the control panel is on recall and had to be replaced. So he asked me to let him in to see the Control panel to confirm it’s the one they show is in my house. He was very knowledgeable of what we had in our home and seemed to be reputable, So now he’s in my house under false pretenses. When he saw the control panel he told me Alert 360 should have replaced my control already (sham on them) now I’m pretty angry at Alert 360 about this time.
To make this long story short he was determined to replace our control panel with the new one, I believed this was a replacement until he said now we need to file divorce papers. I was confused, asked what do you mean by divorce papers? About this time I’m realizing this is not what I thought it was. After he double talked his way through my question I was in this “hook line and sinker”.
Please keep in mind that I just got home after dropping my dog off at the vet for the 1st of 4 chemotherapy treatments ($3000) and this is a bit overwhelming  at the moment, When I informed him of this he pursued that this will only take a few minutes, The technician will be here in about 15 minutes and will get the system replaced. He was persistent that it had to be done today due to the fact our control panel is defective and I bought into his lies.
Now I’m paying more For an upgrade I did not ask for nor needed and I’m signed up for a contract that I did not want.
With hindsight I should have kicked him out of my house. He should have apologized to me and asked if there would be a better time and day for me, but no this guy wanted to make the sale and I went hook line and sinker. That is why I rated it as I did only because there’s no negative numbers they don’t even deserve a one. I’ll be reaching out to my previous provider alert 360 and find out more information And see if they want to pursue a lawsuit.< /review>< pictures>

Wyatt was great getting us set up with everything we wanted. Very knowledgeable and easy going, not st all pushy for things we didnt need or want.
The two that came and installed were amazing, very polite and quick with what they needed to get done.
Overall, very professional company, they even called to follow up on how things were going.

Now for the equipment itself, it's crazy how great the quality of the cameras are. Ours are set to a moderate sensitivity because our neighbor has a few cats. Last night not one cat set off the sensor to alert us of movement, ahhh so a great nights sleep. The ability to talk through the cameras is probably one of my favorite features to be honest. We tested it and played with it, my husband stood in the middle of our front yard and talked normal and I could hear him perfectly.
So, what I am trying to say is, we are happy with the product. Good stuff for sure!</review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>The price seems reasonable especially with a lifetime warranty on the cameras which is excellent but the reason I am giving Vivint a 3 star instead of a 5 star is because I can’t use my phone app to view the camera scene.  I was not told upfront about needing Wi-Fi in the home to use your phone to get the visual from cameras.  Disappointing for me especially after all the great things shown to me by the sales rep with what you can do with the phone app.</Review>< pics>

The tech was excellent and the product appears sound. However,  the commission based sales rep misquoted prices and promised things that wasn't fully in his scope, but the more experienced tech that installed by doorbell cam and sensors eased those frustrations by providing a level of accountability and customer service that one could respect.< /text>

<Time>1592326014961< /Time><rate>3<//rate><Review>Sales rep Kade Lemieux was personable and pleasant to work with. He signed the contract with a different last name which I did not catch until the next day.  The “ techs” came within 30 minutes and were here installing for 3 hours!  They left outside doors open letting in flies and causing some concern about our elderly indoor-only cat escaping.  They were here Much longer than expected. They did NOT introduce themselves. They did not wear ID other than logo t-shirts. They left a poorly patched nickel-sized hole in an obvious place on front room wall.  They left a mess ( some of our boxed storage flipped upside down and scattered ) in the garage after installing an outside side-gate view and left a piece of equipment behind. We were instructed on using the system by the young female.  Young people may want to slow down their presentation for old customers like us ( she was 19,we are in our 70’s... and find we learn some things a bit slower these days 😒🤕)  We can’t figure out how to set the bell/cameras to alert when someone approaches ...  only if they ring the bell. I doubt anyone with ill intentions would ring the bell .   The entire system seems like overkill for our needs. It’s like a Sherman tank when we just need a 4-door sedan.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The sales representative was extremely professional and very informative. He went over all my concerns, explained what they had to offer, and absolutely gave me a good deal. I've seen ads on tv and internet about the products and was impressed, especially being a former sales manager and lead tech for a residencial and commercial security company. This by far exceeded my expectations! This is an awesome product that would definitely give you peace of mind and knowledge that your family and home are secure. Thank you for giving me a better sense of security, especially with what is going on today. I will definitely be adding more  sensors to my home!< /review>

<Text>The services and equipment I received is totally awesome. The installation GURU put his best foot forward and made a really great impression. He was so knowledgeable and made me feel at ease about everything he was doing and the services Vivint would be providing me. I am still in awe and I love my new system.

Sean very professional. I’m glad he picked the locations for cameras and monitor. Explained how to use app and monitor to maximize its usefulness. I like the resolution of the cameras. Sean ran wires in garage. No shortcuts cutting across beams and into open air space. Sean ran wire parallel with beam and rafters and properly securing wires with staples. Sean is a credit to Vivint Smart Home.
Thank you

<Review>I was very pleased with Vivint Smart Home. It started off seeming complicated but by the time Stacy finished setting everything up andi put my code in i was happy. I would recomend them to friends and family. The young ladies knew what they were doing so i gave a thumbs up number 1 for being young go getters and 2 for being so knowledable. Thank s for the wonderful experience Vita</Review></record></dataset><record>

My thought is to leave 2 different reviews. One for sales and service and one for the technician/installer. Sales and service get a 0-1 rating at this point. The tech would get 10 stars if available. More to follow as I see if system was worth the 5.5 hours it took to get my order straightened out.<//text>

We have had our Vivint system for one year. We're in Oakland, so this review goes to the nearest office location. I wish we had gone with a different provider, but since we bought about $1000 worth of equipment through Vivint, it makes more sense to stick with them. Here is a list of disappointments:
- Camera placement was done thoughtlessly, or at least with very little understanding of the range and radius of the camera view. For example, we can't see the face of someone who is at our front door, and we also can't see someone who is walking closely along the front wall of our house.
- We have had numerous instances of trying to check the video footage of people on the property, only to find that the motion-activated camera did not activate. Other times, we notice that there are hundreds of video clips from a single day of the camera being activated by...nothing at all. The motion-activated feature seems inconsistent. The fact that we may or may not have a record of someone entering the property is a major let-down.
- Our interior motion sensor was installed into the corner between two walls with screws that only pierce into about 1/16" of drywall. The sensor soon fell over when the front door was slammed. We reinstalled it ourselves at a different spot on the wall.
- We had a random vandalism on the house and tried to download the video footage a couple of weeks later. It turns out our system's storage settings had been configured to delete video after a certain number of days. We were pretty sure the technician said we could always retrieve footage from Vivint headquarters. After inquiring, Vivint recalibrated our system to delete after 45 days instead of the original less than two weeks. Why didn't they do this in the first place? It seems like our system was configured based on how the technician was feeling that day, not based on our needs.
- Main display often freezes and glitches while reviewing video footage. For example, when scrolling through a long list of short video clips, it freezes. When fwd/rewinding a video with the tracking icon, the display often freezes. On the plus side, we learned how to restart the device from our Vivint phone app.
- Motion detector often takes up to five seconds to activate when we're home. Other times, it gets activated immediately. The inconsistency is troubling.

I still give three stars because the devices and customer service have served the bare minimum of our needs. However, I would not recommend Vivint because of the sense that they didn't really listen to our needs, didn't install the motion detector and cameras in a thoughtful way, and their main display computer is glitchy.<//text>

I'm giving 3 stars because we started off very bad. Wife and I were leaving town this weekend and we decided to get an alarm system before we left town. We called in to schedule an install a week before we left. Vivint gave us the option of picking 3 install days. We picked Tuesday. I wife called out of work to be there for the install but vivint canceled the appointment. We called in and told then we need to make the install happen the next day(Wednesday)  they couldn't do Wednesday but could the following day (Thursday), so we went ahead and scheduled for Thursday.  We made it really critical that it needs to happen Thursday because we were leaving that Saturday morning and if they couldn't do the install to let us know so we could find a company that would.  They graduated Thursday 8am to 10 am.

Guess what! Thursday morning I received a text saying sorry tech cannot make it out today. We were so disappointed. I called out of work to make it happen. Called vivint and to their credit they did make an appointment for outside of their hours to do the installation for Friday after 5 pm.

After the hassle of getting them to come to my house and do the damn installation,  the sales rep told me he would throw in free equipment for only 5 dollars more a month which covered camera monitoring.
Found out that was a lie and it was 15 dollars more.

The install  tech was great. 5 stars to him. He did an amazing job.

To everyone else I'm disappointed in false promises.< /Text>

Staying at hotel one night for fiance to take a 3 hour entrance exam for the Operating Engineers Journeyman Apprenticeship Training Center (located less than half a mile from the Murrieta Inn & Spa) at 7:30 am the following morning.
Even though the hotel it's self was a splurge, I felt he deserved an easy morning on testing day. Being the ever thoughtful gentleman that he is requested I permit him to treat me to dinner at the hotel's restaurant. I've had my fair share of hotel stays encompassing the entire spectrum of quality and type as well as having worked in fine dining during my 20s in Tucson AZ. Although we started our visit less than an hour before closing on a Monday night, THIS WAS BY FAR ONE OF THE TOP 3 BEST TASTING MEALS I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF DINING UPON. Both our meals (his: the filet, farm fresh veggies and mashed potatoes; mine: the salmon, same veggies and crispy fingerling potatoes) were delightful, though his filet was far closer to  well done than the medium well he'd asked for as it was cooked light brown all the way through and had NO pink with the exception of about one square inch on a thicker edge. It was still delicious, tender and every last morsel was savored. He, the ever picky eater (special orders everything plain as possible even at fast food places) and I with my minimal appetite, and spoiled by my years in fine dining, BOTH FINISHED EVERY LAST BITE ON OUR PLATES.

COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF. EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.< /Text>

<text>Me and Blondie went for Tacos on Taco Tuesday, and it was Epic !!!  The Beef Steak Tacos were the best, EVAH !!!  So tender, great flavor and awesome spicy salsa.  This week we have been to the Gate twice, and the service was excellent too.  Spoke with Chef D, and he told us a funny story.  Great people, awesome bartender named Kim !!  Epic drinks !!!  This is my favorite place to eat in California.  I also rate this place in the top 10 for best

Good food. Nice place. New. Beautiful decor. Great staff. A bit pricey but had an awesome evening with my parents and sister for my parent's anniversary. Sat outside on a cold night under the heaters...AWESOME waitress!
We had the steak... it was DELICIOUS.<//Review>

<Review>Being a true Sloughhouse resident. This was surprisingly first visit.  The steak was cooked to perfection and matched my ice cold adult beverage. Very nice and upscale dinning. I strongly recommend and will be back very soon.

Thank you very much!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

<review>I wish I had taken a picture of my beautiful caprese frittata this morning, but was so eager to tuck into it, that it was an after thought. It was as delicious as it was beautiful.  My husband got the Gate breakfast with sausage and an add on of the pancakes which he said tasted like sourdough and were the best he’s ever had. My sister in law got the gate breakfast as well and my brother in law ordered the chicken fried prime rib, that I didn’t think sounded good, but when I had a bite it was heavenly.  We all agreed that everything was perfectly done and the use of the Angel farms heirloom tomatoes and other quality ingredients made this an excellent breakfast.  The potatoes were done in a way that I have never experienced and all four of us enjoyed.  Highly recommended!< /review>< pics>

<text>This visit was my first time at The Gate.  I am really impressed.  Jenny and Rachael genuinely greeted us when we walked in.  They were happy to have us there.  We decided to sit at the bar where Christina took our orders.  She is an amazing bartender...full of knowledge, friendly, and she was working hard and fast to get the orders in and the drinks out.  The drinks were amazing and the food delightful.  My wife definitely recommends the Murietta Martini.  We will be going back often.  Great Job.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Text>Beautiful place!  The food is more a European cuisine?? It's good but a little on the high price for what you get. The service is very very slow.

My opinion is they need to change the menu selection to stay competitive with the Rancho Murieta country club.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809aed404c774995:0xeb5395dbd17fe218</Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><name>Lucy Anderson< /name>< Resp>

<Review>Stopped in for a quick drink to check out the place. Christina was our bartender she was excellent!  They were semi busy and she kept drinks flowing, not just her customers at the bar but the waiters and their tables. Beautiful place!

<Time>1525577018340</Time><rating>2</rating><review>The food was good, but it took forever to be served and refills of coffee and water were never offered. We had to ask for basic service while watching servers have extended conversations with people at the bar and a few others.  I have enjoyed meals at many resort spa restaurants and have never recieved such awful service. We chose this place thinking we'd get some much needed pampering as generally happens at resort restaurants because we have been swamped with work. Today was supposed to be a needed break. .  I always leave a generous tip, but not today. AND I have never left a two star rating on anything. i prefer to offer compliments over complaints but this experience begged for a very negative rating.  Again, the food was quite good,  the place is clean and comfortable, but our service today was lousy at best.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x809aed404c774995:0xeb5395dbd17fe218<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The spinach salad had so much dressing on it it was nearly cooked. The accompanied shrimp was well over done. Wine glass seemed a little short on the pour also. $$$< /Review>

The ambiance is fantastic and that's unfortunately the only thing positive about our experience. The food was mediocre at best and way overpriced for what it was.  The menu is very limited, our meal took over an hour to be served, and then was delivered cold.  I witnessed other diners experiencing similar results with their meals as well.  Perhaps it was just a bad night for the kitchen staff but none of the four of us felt the experience was worth the money or the wait.< /text>

The food and service are good,  but not good enough for 5 stars. There are better restaurants in the same price range near Rancho  Murieta.<//text>

<review>Excellent service by Luis Casas.  He is always 100%.  He is on time, professional, provides feedback when he finishes if something unusual is found.  He is courteous and lets me know when he finishes so I can close my gates.  Too bad all the service persons are not as excellent as he is!<//review>< pictures>

Lou Martin del Campo prepping info was good and Christian/site foreman was very professional. We appreciated Christian and the crew raising possible concerns on the day of the job (steep roof and solar panels) rather than just proceeding. The clean up was good and we appreciated the card taken with our garden. Thank you!</Text>

Benny at Terminix came out today to do an inspection of our house and check for termite damage.  He was thorough, professional, very helpful and kind.  I have been so happy with our quarterly service with Terminix, and Benny just made me happier to be a repeat customer!  Thanks Benny - you rock!<//review>

Do NOT use this company! Bait and Switch. They quoted me one price, and raised it when I tried to schedule! Not only that but they canceled the original day they were scheduled to give me an estimate an hour before... he wanted to reschedule 2 days later which I did, but was over 30 minutes later than he said he would be. Total waste of my time. I own multiple homes and will NEVER use this company!< /review>

<text>I am pleased with terminix as always. Their technicians are always upbeat, happy, and extra courteous. The tech went the extra mile and made sure all my windows and doors were closed and locked before he left. Then sent me a message letting me know he did so. As always, I think prices and options could be a little better for the customer even though terminix is better priced than all the others. There is always room for improvement. All in all terminix does not disappoint.</text>< Pics>

If it doesn't you can reschedule for a day and time that does work. It's super easy and they take great care when entering your property. Give them a call you wont regret it.</Review><rating>5<//rating><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

<review>We have been using Terminix for many years for general bug control and recently had a bee issue so we naturally called them out.  They sent an inspector out (Nate) and he said it would be $690 which we agreed to pay.  They sent Scott to do the work.  Days later and weeks later bees are still there, I have notified the inspector Nate and texted with Davina, Ashley and Scarlett at their office, since they don't pick up their phones, multiple times and they completely ignored the issue or responded and provided no solution and they never sent anyone back.  HORRIBLE customer service and will never use them again.  We were long time customers and I always recommended them, but they have completely changed and service is terrible.< /review>< UserId.>

Terminix is a greatcompany for pest control!! They’re punctual and respectful! I love my technician and we have built a mutual trust!! One important thing to remember is; it takes a few months of monthly service to see complete results. You won’t see the difference on the first visit, but for us, by month 4 or 5, we were pest FREE!! I would recommend them to anyone!< /review>

I needed an inspection and the tech, Richie called me 10 mins before my appointment and said he couldn't help me because he wasn't familiar with the type of pest I had. I contacted customer service and waited over an hour on hold just to be told they can leave a voicemail for this guys manager. I have rescheduled 3 times and still haven't heard anything back. Use someone else. These guys are a joke.< /Review>

The termite inspector and the termite technicians were professional and amazing.  The inspector took the time to ensure that we understood what he found and recommended the type of treatment.   The termite techs were efficient and thorough.  They found a few additional spots and also treated them.The best part.... this was totally covered in our termite contract.</Review>

I dont reccomend Terminix. Sales rep Mark was so assuring and nice when he came to do the inspection, which is why I chose terminix over other companies that had actaully quoted less to fumigate our home. (Terminix started off at $2771 for a 2 story 1700 sq ft home- tent for drywood termites. Got them down to $1850 with 2 year warranty)
I guess after Mark got the sale, that was it, didnt care anymore. Said I could text him with any questions. I did, 5 questions thru out 4 days and never got a reply. Called and never got an answer or call back.

Worse part was, we were scheduled for a Wednesday morning, had our whole house ready- all food bagged and packed up, gas company already shut off gas, hotel rooms booked. No one shows up, Mark said that someone in another department 'forgot' to schedule us. MAJOR inconvienece, but Mark apologized and said he'd give us a discount. Got us scheduled for the next day. Later only offered an extra year warranty. We didnt need that, he said discount, so that's what we needed. Because we had to book an extra hotel night. Still havent heard back or resolved the 'discount' for the major inconvenience.

Honestly wish I had gone with a different company. Sure was a good pitch, after that no assurance or help what so ever.<//Text>

Experience from beginning to end was very professional, informative and prompt. I received email updates on the techs arrival with information of his name and picture which I absolutely love as it’s a safe secure way to ID the person arriving to your residence. Updates on service provided were also sent to my email. The Tech was very nice and professional. He provide details on what he was going to do, what he did and what he found needed to be done. I retained their services for a year with quarterly  visits due to the ant, spider and mosquito issues we have in our area. After the first visit we all noticed a dramatic change. I highly recommend this service.<//Text>

Walk throughout my property and the inside of my home without wearing a mask . Was not clear about service and pricing ,but was quick to collect my credit card and set up an account without my knowledge. I have 3 children at home one sufers from asthma. This comopany was brought in to keep our home pest ,vermin ,and disease free  . Really disappointed with Terminix for not implementing most current safety and basic guidelines.  My home was the last appointment of the day.  Makes me cringe when I think of how nany other properties he visited. I have surveillance footage of this man wiping his nose without gloves and continue inspection.
I have contacted Terminix and canceled my unconsented agreement and explained the issue . They fixed all my issues with an apology bs.<//Review>< resp>

Not even worthy of one star. Made an appointment online for a termite inspection.No one from the company called to confirm. Day of appointment, sales person from the Santa Fe Springs office, Edwin, texted to say he was running late but would be there; this was still within the 2-hour window they gave me, annoying, but not unreasonable. When he finally arrives and I show him termite droppings in garage he says those are old, you've had an infestation for a long time, you can tell because the droppings are a dark color. Yes, we know we've had an infestation for awhile, but the garage is actually framed in redwood which makes the droppings a dark color. He proceeds to walk around the house "inspecting" using the flashlight on his phone. He does a cursory "inspection" in the attic, failing to notice we actually have two separate attic spaces due to an addition. He spends 5 minutes walking the perimeter of the house, failing to notice the active infestation we have in the fascia. He never even bothered to go under the house to look for subterranean termites, which we know we have. So after the 20-minute "inspection",  I get the sales pitch which is basically the cost of the tenting and the special spray that causes termites to die when they land on the treated surface (Really? Rolling my eyes). When I say I need to discuss with my partner, and ask for the estimate to be emailed to me, he types some more on his tablet and presents the "special discount price" which my credit card will "guarantee" for 3-days, if I decide to cancel in that time, no problem, my card will not be charged. Trying not to laugh out loud, I again say I need to think about it, and to please send me the estimate. I try to ask him some questions about security during tenting. He completely dismisses my concerns, "what are you worried about, there's nothing in here" (we are in the process of remodeling).  I said I was concerned about vandalism, and stealing fixtures. He laughs, "Oh, fixtures, that's funny". Maybe he didn't know that meant lighting, hardware, etc.?  The patronizing, unprofessional, disrespectful attitude irritates me, but worse, I'm sure many people fall for these sales tactics.  Terminix used to have a great reputation. If you are thinking about using this company, do your research, and carefully consider the other reviews online.< /review>

<Text>Paul Andrade from Terminix called to remind me of my scheduled service two days prior. I wasn’t going to be home, he let me know it wasn’t a problem and to leave the gate unlock to treat the back. I would highly recommend him. The day prior I made sure my kids outdoor toys were put away. I didn’t realized I had forgot to moved their chairs from the porch. When I arrived home the service had been completed and I noticed the chairs had been moved. I appreciate the care demonstrated through this action. The safety of my family is highly important to me and this was one of the reasons I was reluctant to join when I first did, but I am reassured I made the right choice to have joined.< /Text>< username>

We recently noticed some termite droppings around the window of our daughters room and I immediately began doing some online research on how best to handle the problem. I went on Home Advisor website as we had previously used their service to hire a roofing company and we were very satisfied with the process. Home Advisor connected us with 3 different companies and throughout the week we received our quotes. I was very surprised to find that Terminix had given us the best price lower by several hundred dollars for Tent Fumigation. Edwin from Terminix was very knowledgeable and gave us several options  on how to deal with our termite problem, he explained everything thoroughly  and in a simple manner. The day of fumigation Andy and his team were very polite and on time, we have 2 small children and we were still trying to get them ready for the mini vacation we took since we would have to leave our home for a few days. Andy gave us time to ready ourselves and did not rush us. Andy messaged me when him and his team had left our home and informed that I could turn on my home alarm. On the day we came back home we were surprised to find several items that we had forgotten to bag for the fumigation had been bagged by Andy and his team. We really appreciate that they did this for us even though they didn’t have to. We are very satisfied with the Price, Profesionalism, and Excellent Customer service provided to us by Terminix and we would definitely recommend them to our friends and family.<//Text>

<Text>Don't waste your time trying to contact any other company. After calling four different companies, both large and small, including those recommended by friends and neighbors, I was getting no where. Those other companies never even returned my calls. Finally, after weeks of living with my pest problem, my leasing agent told me to call Terminix.

I was able to reach a representative on first try and scheduled by inspection to take place within days of my call. The technician was on time, communicative and knowledgeable. I've had four other home maintenance companies work in my condo since I've leased it and none of them have been efficient, on time or friendly until Terminix.

The technical was friendly and he took the time to listen to my concerns and to educate me on causes and prevention.

Don't trust the 4.6 star rating here. Elsewhere like BBB, Yelp, YellowPages etc. are all rated at 1 star. I wish I noticed this before I call them. I would rate 0 if I can. Extremely unpunctual, unprofessional, and unresponsive. My project needed the worker come 2 times in total but I had to schedule 5 appointments because he failed to show up for 3 times! He only showed up on the 3rd and 5th appointment! And every time if I didn't contact the sales person Brandon asking why, no one from the company took the initiative to contact me. They did initiatively charge me in full right after the first visit. And after the 3rd time no-show I was promised $200 refund because of this. But as of now it is been 3 weeks since the work is completed I still not receive the money. Brandon never actively get this processed. Every time when I message him asking about the progress the answer is always "it needs my boss's approval and I am waiting for his reply". I am so disappointed with the service.</Review>

I’ve been with Terminix for years, but I’ve been trying to get an inside service done and they have missed three windows of service. NO CALL NO SHOW!
I’ve also been trying to get an initial service done for another property and their reps keep mixing up times and the addresses. But what good is setting up appointment times when they can’t even keep them.
Incompetency at every level!
I’m moving on to another company that may charge more but at least values their customers and their time.</Review>

The ONLY reason we continue with Terminix is our technician CHRIS MENDOZA.  For all practical purposes he is TERMINIX.He is almost like part of the family!!  We always know before he comes, when he is there, and when he is leaving, and what was done!!If we are overrun with ants he is there the same day!!<//review>

<review>DO NOT enter into a contract with them. Their inspector lied to me and tried to get me for $12,000.00 in service. Second opinion inspector took me to the attic himself and showed me everything. The Terminix inspection was a complete lie. I called within 48 hours to cancel the contract. Now a month later they are still saying I owe THEIR credit company, SMAC. I have called and called. I have confirmation numbers. I have escalation numbers. I have spent majority of mornings on the phone with their inept call takers. NO one resolves anything here. What they have done is criminal fraud. Charged services never rendered, promised to take care of and reverse it all out, and they have done nothing. I am still on the hook for the money for services never performed. DO NOT sign anything with them. Get a second opinion. So fraudulent.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1566241077278, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

<review>Very unhappy with their service! We agreed on a day and made me take everything out of my kitchen. Didn't show up the day of service, I called the office and they had me for another day I didn't agree on. I tried getting someone asap and they had me back and fourth. Then came without telling me and when they did come I was not home and my brother was, and they didn't do what they were suppose to. I till this day (Saturday), since Wednesday have my stuff out in my living room and haven't been able to use my kitchen to Cook. Very bad service!!! I called the inspector that came to my house to ask about when they are coming, he answered very rudely, got mad and said he was going to cancel my contract when we didn't even have one yet. His name was David Montoya, a Licensed Field Inspector. I do not recommend this company at all!! Very poor service and bad communication skills within the employees themselves 👎</review>< date>

<Name>Tim Hanks< /Name><Review>With our home in Escrow and quickly approaching the Closing the Buyers challenged the Terminix Inspection Report and demanded the house be fumigated.  Mike Casey, Sr. Warranty Department Inspector, quickly came to my rescue. Within two (2) days of my request and without any hassle (since we had the Terminix Annual Inspection Warranty Insurance) Mike orchestrated an absolutely remarkable feat of getting a fumigation team lined up to treat the home.  Once the fume was done he also made sure any roofline repairs were made.  Everything was done to meet the escrow closing deadline without any cost to me.  This is the kind of performance that truly represents a great company.  Mike demonstrated that Terminix cares for customers (he was easy to reach and returned my calls) and the company will do whatever is necessary to mitigate a crisis to keep customers satisfied. Termites are a nuisance and people really need to protect their homes. I will be using the Terminix Annual Inspection Warranty on my next home and Mike's business card will remain in my wallet as a symbol of someone who is truly a modern day "Mover and Shaker" who works hard to get things done quickly and correctly.

This is to extend my very special thanks to Mike and all the other Support Staff and to Terminix for standing behind their warranty in my time of great need.< /Review><UserId.>106012605533489407782<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This company has always let us know well ahead of time that the appointment is coming up so we can plan around it. When they arrive, they always check with us for any special instructions or problem areas that need attention. The spraying takes very little time, but the customer service is the important part. We can always count on Terminix to listen and we never have problems with spiders or bugs. They do a terrific job!</Review>< GmapID>

This horrible company took total advantage of my elderly Father. He signed a termite contract with them but a couple years later, my Mother passed away and he didn't get around to scheduling a termite inspection. Understandably, since he was sad and grieving. He didn't get around to scheduling an inspection the year after either, since he fell into some health problems of his own.

TERMINIX, continued to collect his money anyway, and did not refund his money for services not rendered. No inspections, no treatments, no nothing. But they continued to collect his money anyway.

A couple of years later, my Father unfortunately passed away as well. I ended up taking over his property, got an inspection by another company, and they told me that the termites had done extensive damage to the house. I kindly asked TERMINIX to refund my Father's money for the past few years that he was not serviced.

Martin Macias, who was the representative who I was working with, refused to refund it!

Shame on you, TERMINIX!!

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I scheduled a 10am-12pm window back on Monday for an inspection.

I was waiting for 2 hours, but didn't hear anything.

I called dispatch. The dispatcher called the driver and told me Marlin was 25 minutes away and on his way. I requested he call when he's a few minutes away as there were special parking and entry instructions. She said she'd call him again and tell him.

30 minutes later I didn't hear anything. So I waited longer. After an hour I called in. The dispatcher said the inspector was only doing a roach inspection and that's why he might not have shown up since they don't do write-ups for roach inspections.

I said that's not what I was told. So she asked a manager and said write-ups for roach inspections were at the inspector's discretion. Some do them and some don't.

I asked her to call the inspector. She couldn't reach him. She said he was behind. But I said I still wanted the service.

At 2pm no one showed up. I called back. The dispatcher told me a previous dispatcher had cancelled the service much earlier. I was livid. I told her every dispatcher told me the inspector was still on his way and I always said I still wanted the service. I asked how this could happen and she said they're poorly trained.

Because of this I needlessly wasted 4 hours of my time.

She offered to reschedule for this upcoming Thursday from 1-3pm. I was disappointed but figured I’d give them one more shot.

Fast forward to Wednesday (the day before) and I get a call that afternoon from an inspector telling me I wasn’t home and asking if he had the right address. After calling him back, I was furious but realized it wasn’t his fault.

When I called Terminix they saw the notes they were supposed to schedule on Thursday from 1-3pm but put me down for Wednesday from 1-3pm.

I am done with this company. They are incompetent beyond belief and they clearly don’t want my business if they screw up majorly twice in 2 days.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1539878207721, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

<Review>I was notified a few days ahead of the service date and received text updates when Luis was nearby. He worked quickly and efficiently and sent me another email message when the service was complete (I was not home, but my roommate was). Also another text message. That's the way it's supposed to work and always does.</Review>< rating>

<Review>The individuals who have inspected my home over the years by Terminix have always been polite and professional, have been respectful of my possessions, and have always followed up when any action was required. Any shortcomings have come from the back office.The advice offered when an infestation has been found has always been effective and prompt.The person who inspected my home this year, Paul Andrade, followed in that tradition. I am completely satisfied that I am termite free, at least for the moment.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I canceled my contract with Terminix a few months ago after over 15 years of excellent service.  My cancellation was due to lack of service and lack of concern from my local Terminix office.  I was recently contacted by the national office and offered another contract.  I decided to give Terminix another chance.  I was very pleased with my most recent service.  The technician, Erik, was very professional.  He took the time to talk to me about the area I needed him to treat in my kitchen pantry and explain the type of infestation and treatment process.  I was also very happy to be contacted by email and text so that I was able to track the arrival of the technician.  I am looking forward to continued excellent service.</review>

Been doing business with Terminix for years. We have always been very pleased with the service. We use the pest control, termite control, and mosquito service, (which actually worked!). We have never had any problems with them. Although I do wish that their caller ID showed "Terminix" instead of "Private Caller".<//Text>

For a routine exterior quarterly pest control service, Terminix has been reliable and effective.  They notify me beforehand of the date and time, knock on the door and verify the areas that need the most attention, and get the job done.  We used to have lots of ants coming in our house, now we are ant-free.< /Text>

Very timely, communicative service. The guys came when they said they were going to come, called 30 minutes before and texted right as they arrived (as I asked them to do because I didn't want them ringing the doorbell), they did their work efficiently and professionally, explained everything to me, walked me through their work, and were extremely pleasant and friend. I was very impressed and am extremely satisfied. Thank you!<//review>

The person that came out to do the inspection (Nate)didn’t bother to check visually to see if the tent fumigation would be possible. He stated that he would be getting signatures from my neighbors since my garage is connected to he house behind mine and next door. The day of the fumigation I was at work and left my mom at home with intstructions that they would be coming. When the employees got here they stated that only one neighbor signed the form and they were not able to get access to the other house.
I was at work and was receiving a million phone calls from Terminix that they wanted to move forward with the fumigation but wouldn’t be able to tent my garage. Nate texted and informed me that we would have to go the route of spraying the garage in sessions. I clearly asked him if this format would be the same as tenting the garage and he confirmed. The guys that were actually tenting the house informed my mom that spraying the garage would most definitely not work the same way.
To top it off the guy that tented my home stated that I would have to leave again although they would just be covering the garage if they were to ever do it! Are you kidding me I have to pay 800+ again to stay at a hotel!
I’ve been calling the office in Santa Fe springs and haven’t been able to get through, an operator answers after hours and she’s been saying that she left a message so someone can get back to me since Nate doesn’t answer my calls either and nothing!
This company is not reputable! I never provide feedback but they are a true scamming company all they care for is getting your signature to bill you!

Will most definitely inform all possible people to never do business with this company!!

RIDICULOUS!!! they replied to my posting saying to contact them, I emailed them Monday and called Tuesday now it’s Thursday evening and I haven’t heard from anybody!

I was guaranteed a call within 24-48 hours.
I want nothing to do with this company my contract will most definitely be canceled!< /review>

Sorry I can't give you the names of all the associates I have encountered in my years with the company, but I can't remember a time or experience that I was not treated courteously. I have been particularly impressed by the service of the last two inspectors that have come to my home. I'm sorry I don't have the name of last year's gentleman, but this year it was David Montoya. I appreciated both of their honesty in suggesting improvements that could be made to the house to further protect it from termites. As a side note last week my neighbor was scheduled for an inspection and I even met and had an opportunity to chat with L'Roderick on that occasion. It is not to often that a company's name on the side of the car would encourage me to greet the associate.</text>

1.0 star rating 7/2/2018
Another terrible review! Why bother taking time writing? So no one else will use this company.

First, my previous company was bought out by Terminix. This spring on our annual inspection, the inspector, who is really an inexperienced salesman in sheep's clothing, found rat droppings, fresh, in the attic. Not surprising. So I accepted their exclusion service, which was fine. But then they put traps in the attic to remove any rats. They did not check the traps for a month, until I called and asked them to. Surprise, no rats! Great. But I know that they did not remove the traps, and they did not ever come back to check them. So I probably have dead, decaying rats in my attic.

Second, the salesman said they could get rid of my gophers but I needed to add the whole house coverage with an initial cost of $500 plus $100 each quarter. He said that they would not use poison, since we have dogs. However, the technician doing the job said they always use poison. The long and short is, 6 months later, we still are overrun with gophers. And, they know that they are not fixing the problem so they don't bother coming any more.

Repeated calls to the company supervisor are unanswered. When I call in (by the way, the phone service and operators are VERY NICE and cooperative!!), I am promised a call back within two days. The billing office said that they could waive the $100 quarterly payment but that the supervisor should review the case and do that. Obviously, the supervisor is ineffective, probably overwhelmed with complains, and not able to effect any change.

I am now at the regional manager level with a promise from the (nice) phone representative, of a call back.  When? Who knows but I will be asking for my $500 back!

It continues to get worse. The regional manager must have called the local manager in Santa Fe Springs who did call me back. He PROMISED refund of $500 and immediate service. I RECEIVED NEITHER. Further, the accounting department now calls constantly asking for not only the March $100, but an additional $100 for July service that I never received, AS PROMISED BY THE LOCAL MANAGER.

You cannot call the local office! Their number rolls over to the Corporate office somewhere else in these United States.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2d259850d4a4b:0xc5f7cb077eee7da8<//gmap_id><userid>104230692789063622496< /userid></record>

Wether the work was done or not is still in question.Talked to several customer service people, did not get call backs as promised, had to chase after them to get more information. Company cares more about ripping you off than doing the right thing. If you do decide to try them, do not do the automatic payment from your account. They feel its ok to take the money out of your account  whenever they deem it necessary.

When we called for a quote, the gentleman who inspected was informative about our damage, the process we were facing and attentive to the fact I have a daycare business in my home to work around. The workers showed up earlier in the afternoon than they stated so we were able to begin a bit sooner than anticipated. They were respectful of my home and contents. They called before returning so we could meet them at the house for detenting.< /Review>

<date>1527206030143</date><user_name>Kate Sozio</user_name><Review>I have been having a horrendous problem with gophers in the yard.  Terminix came out and for $420 will treat my yard for 1 year.  After 1 week of treatment I have only 1 new mound rather than the 5-7 I would find every day.  Here's hoping to some more succesful treatments. Paul the service technician was great. He called before he showed up and then spent over an hour on both visits. Very polite and courteous young man.</Review>< response>

<Review>At approximately 10 minutes before my two hour waiting window , I received a voice message from a staff member impersonating himself as a supervisor, who stated that he was out of town and needed to reschedule the appointment for another date. When I followed up with the actual office I was told that he was a service tech not a sup. Not only was this unprofessional and a total disregard for my time that I took to accommodate this request, but totally dishonorable as a representative of this organization. If a person on staff can act in such bad faith, how can he or this company be trusted on anything that they claim in their reports and or services tendered? Shady business!!!< /Review>< pics>

Working with Terminix was very easy.  We set up the appointment, got a call a few days before the appt to remind me of things I had to do (clean out the fridge, medicines, etc).  Everything went really smoothly and they were on time.< /Review>

Everything went well despite the reschedule of fumigation due to gas shut off problems. Overall, great communication with Angel Rodriguez (inspector) and Mario (fumigation supervisor crew) everything was done as promised! Thank you and great team!</Review>

Technician was running late due to your required meeting. He called as soon as he could to let us know & see if his  new ETA  would be acceptable or if we needed him to reschedule. He is extremely polite and always checks to see if we are experiencing any problems. He also reminds us he can come between scheduled visits should any problems arise.< /Review>

DO NOT USE TERMINEX!! ZERO stars!  My house did the fumigation treatment recently. They damaged  over 100 roof tiles. I spend $1400 to repair the roof.  I  was  told by the inspector ,that  if they damage over 10  tiles during the treatment. They will stop the  fumigation. I understand that some tiles  may damage  during the process. But should  not have been that much. I called the company  many  times to complain. However , no one has returned my calls. Seems like they try to avoid the problems.< /review>

The reviews are true. This company is ran my COMPLETE dumb asses. COMPLETE DUMB ASSES! First, they don’t ask you what day/time you would like. They randomly pick a day and more than likely it doesn’t work for you. Somehow, the phone appointments are completely different from what the technicians have. What kind of dumb f*ckery is that?! I have had nothing but issues with these idiots, but they charge your card quickly and on time. Somehow, they can’t make the service work the same way. They obviously don’t care because numerous people complain and they still continue the same stupid ass practice, which is not in the best interest of the customer. I recommend using Orkin or even DIY stuff from Home Depot. This company is a big joke.<//review>

<review>Terminix provides an invaluable service necessary for desert living. Termininx is statffed by true professionals. They show up on time, are pleasant and polite, and immediately set about the task of spraying to keep our home free of desert bugs.

We felt marginalized by the previous service provided as it was not effective in removing our pest problem. One individual made a difference in restoring our confidence that we made the right choice in pest control services available in our area. Neal Marsh made the right decision to provide us with the highest personal and professional service as well as ensuring our needs were met by coordinating with other members of his team to mitigate our immediate issues. We were very impressed by his actions and the courteous response we received with Alfredo for exclusion inspection and Christian for follow-up pest removal. This is the type of service I had originally envisioned I would be receiving but had grown disillusioned and eventually would have to start shopping again. I hope this continues to be the example set by your company and look forward to this continued service. Shaun Long Beach, CA< /review>

I had Terminix service my home for a roach issue, when I signed up for the service I was promised that if I agreed to pay another 100 dollars that the roaches would be gone on the first treatment. The first treatment came and the roaches were still here after a week I was told I would get the 100 dollars back if the roach treatment failed which it did. I have made 2 more appointments to have them come out and treat for the roaches and they have stood me up both times. I was told 10 times that the branch manager Todd Rushworth would return my calls. To this day I have never got a call from anyone in Terminix. I was told by corporate that would cancel my service and zero my account and we would part our ways. Well you guessed it no calls and I just got a notice of collection from there collection company. So now I am filling out the small claims court papers to take them to court. This could of all be avoided had Todd Rushworth returned one of my 10 calls. If you are smart you would avoid this company like the plague. Very dishonest and only cares about the money . Todd Rushworth is not a very good branch manager of the Santa Fe Springs office. I just talk to corporate and am waiting a call from them again. I will update this post when I hear from them.

I stand by my quote but the owner called me and took care of all the issues and concerns I had. I would use this place again now that I am better educated about the process.< /review>

Not sure how they get good reviews. Check yelp. I had this team that destroyed plants on 5 bays and left one bay only OK where they protected the plants. I showed them how to wrap the tent around the patio posts and seal it next to curb and they followed instructions on one bay only letting the tent on other 5 bays cover plants and kill them 3-5 feet wide. they also broke few sprinkler lines. I will try to figure how to upload the pictures so you can see with your own eyes. They broke one huge plant pot and one worker told me: " With your money this is nothing" Horrible experience. Run, do not let your property in their hands. About $3-4000 worth of damage</Text>

<text>Haven't seen any cockroaches since their visit. Couldn't be happier to be pest free. Angel Canales and helper were polite and professional. Not to mention here early which was so nice. They answered all my questions and had suggestions to keep pests away. Very happy with their service.<//text>< username>

TERMINIX has been the extermination service I've used for many many years and they have always done a great job. Salvador Rodriguez has been our tech for many years. He is courteous, friendly, reliable and very thorough. I've not had any problems ever. I trust TERMINIX.<//Text>

The only reason I'm givin a four star rating, is that their external treatment for pests like spiders and ants was lacking. It's supposed to control bugs for three months, but after only a month we had spider webs all over the outside of our home. I would expect better extermination of bugs for the price I paid. Could probably do the same with a gallon of spectricide and only pay $12.00.<//Review><rating>4< /rating>< pics>

We have bait stations around the house, now for 2 years.  They seem to be working, I did not see the usual swarming termites after the rain.

We're not huge fans of environmental pesticides.  But we also have a woodsy backyard and spiders, mosquitos and other bugs have made their way into our house alot in the past.  This doesn't happen now.  And the care and consideration of the service reps are good - we particularly appreciate our guy who comes, Frankie.< /Text>

< Review>
My experience with Terminix lays mostly within the communication lines open to consumers within their company.  Customer service is instructed to not give out names and numbers of supervisors or anyone that can actually HELP you. Instead, they rely on technicians, some very skilled -- others not.  They try to sell you services that you don't need at a very high price. If I were a good technician, I'd stay away from this company's practices of making sales people out of all of you. As for the consumer.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!< /Review>

<Review>Completely checked all areas as usual, sprayed for pests inside and out, but 4 days later, we were invaded with ants and black widows everywhere. We called for a respray and it improved the problem about 70%.This has happened before, maybe a strong spray should be used, the first time. The technician is always very polite and leaves everything very clean. He usually arrives close to time period or calls if going to be early or late, which is appreciated. Customer service is very cooperative about setting up a reinspection or spraying. Have been with Terminex for many years. Have coverage for all areas of service for our property.<//Review>< pics>

I paid for a higher level of insulation to an R50 but they installed lesser level after we asked an independent company to check it out and took pics that it was between an R32-R38.  I have been contacting them for over two weeks, David my sales rep by text. Left msg, contacted customer service 3x to escalate to higher level - and nobody gives you a courtesy call back and they are dodging calls.  VERY BAD BUSINESS - this is fraud!  I suggest any of you who has had insulation installed dont take their word for it since you usually dont go up there.  Today I was told it was escalated to the Regional Level - waiting for response.  If they are HONEST - they should have contacted me the first time to talk about issue and rectify situation instead of this total blackout.<//review>

I gave them 1 star only because 0 was not an option. Scheduled an appt. over the weekend for Monday. Here we are on Wednesday and no technician has appeared. Have called numerous times and not 1 call back. They did however process my monthly service fee. So dissapointing.</review>

I discovered termites swarming outside my house. Being a single senior citizen, I did not know what to do. I called the pest control company that was servicing inside my house and was told that there was water under my house and nothing could be done until that dried up!? No offer of how to get rid of water! Two different neighbors said "call Terminex", which I did. John Hayhurst, inspector came out and pumped the water out from under my house, did everything necessary to inspect and treat my house! He was the first person that showed that he wanted to help me, instead of looking for a reason not to. Terminex may be a little more expensive,? But you sure get what you pay for!</Text>

<Review>This review is for Terminix commercial  in general.
seriously... they suck.
Tech turn around rate is high. Service is terrible. They do not show up on day and time of "scheduled appts".  They do not return calls. They respond to extra service request 3 weeks after initial request.  They will give you all kinds of reasons why YOU didn't request things in the right way. Sometimes you luck out and get a great tech... one that returns your calls and shows up in a reasonable amount of time after a request. I havent had one of those in probably 3 years. My current tech is friendly and polite in person. fabulous. This does not help me if i cannot get  serviced when requested. This is a business. They obviously do not value everyones business. have been a customer , this time around since 2013. Clearly, ive been beyond patient. Looks like its time for a new company... again.
* for those who wonder whyI stayed so long with a company that treats its customers so nonchalantly: laziness and convenience. I didnt want to start the whole figuring it out process with someone else. but they have exceeded even my low bar and threshold for lazin<//Review>< response>

<text>Negative 10-- I never do anything like this but to anyone in the SoCal, please do NOT use Terminix. Alix and I noticed a few termites and called based on a recommendation. What has happened--- has been the worst customer service EVER! First the inspector at Terminix scheduled our house to be for June 6th. Terminix came and laid bait traps collected money from us. We called to get some questions answered and were informed that our tenting was for July 6th not June 6th. Which was no biggie. We asked for a call from the branch manager at Terminix and we never got one. On June 6th-- the gas company turned off our Gas because of a request from Terminix. The house wasn't tented but the gas was off. When the gas company came back to turn on the gas they broke our stove. We called Terminix 4 more times asking for a branch manager. NOTHING. Finally--we cancelled. Guess what --we got a call from the Terminix branch manager asking us about the tenting on July 6th. This is two days after we cancelled. He said he wasn't informed then he never returned our calls. Today our gas was shut off again because Terminix never informed the gas company that we cancelled so here we go again. Terminix when you are asking people for a lot of money. Give them common or basic customer service. Terminix is the worst and never use them.</text>< userid>

Their Branch manager Andrew doesnt know how to return phone calls. 5 hours waiting for his  call and nothing. Thats the BRANCH MANAGER for you guys.  Their fumigation crew can't follow directions nor keep track of time.  They donar give you courtesy phone call to ask if you can come in early than expected, they just show up ame expect you get out of their way.. .
Their dispatch ladies cant help out either, they promise to have mánagers and or crew members  call you back with in minutes and that never happens. Called back hours later than they say that there is a 24 hr call back waiting time.... 24 hrs? What is that going to solve? There is no sense of urgency here. If was able to not highlight a star í wouldn't...< /text>

< Review>
Near the Santa Fe Springs Terminix branch, I was stopped at light watching what appeared to be a stalled Terminix vehicle that was 2-3 car lengths behind the vehicle in front of it.  The driver was smoking a cigarette in the car.  I easily maneuvered my car in front of him so I wouldn't miss the light.  When the light turned green, the Terminix employee sped past me swerving violently while sticking his middle finger out the window, before pulling into his workplace parking lot.  Given his irrational and aggressive behavior, I'd think twice before contracting the services of a Terminix employee.</Review>
