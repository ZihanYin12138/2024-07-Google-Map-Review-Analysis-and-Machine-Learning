I have been a client for more than 5 years. The Agency truly represents  the highest levels of excellent services.  The staff are very professional, friendly and amazing. The owners and staff are always willing to go an extra mile to assist their customers.  Also the Agency offers different types of awesome services.  I highly recommended The Agency.

Thank you  so much for all your support!!  Alfred  and Perla are always a phone call away for any questions or concerns.  Your business is greatly appreciated.<//review>

They were so nice and welcoming. Helped me with my taxes and it was a breeze. So much better than going to the impersonal name brand places. It feels like family there. Support small business and give the Agency a try. You won't regret it.<//text>

I was referred by my friend last year and needed to file my taxes with someone who was credible and not going to rip me off. They are amazing people and have affordable pricing. I used them again for 2nd year in a row.
Thank you< /text>

I’ve been working with Karen for quite some time and I saw results right away with her work. She is very honest and upfront about what can be done and has already over delivered. I’m very impressed with Karen’s work and would recommend her to anyone needing credit assistance!</Review>

I would like to say thank you to The Agency for such a great job they did on improving my credit.  They were always in communication and very knowledgeable on any questions I had. It did take time but well worth the wait. You do have to be  patient nothing good come over night.  I'm very excited to finally have a high credit score. Thank you again!</Review>

I’ve been getting my taxes done here for a few years! Alfred, Perla and the rest of the staff are so polite and attentive. They make it so convenient getting my taxes done virtually. I moved out of LA county and it was so daunting thinking of finding a new tax preparer. But luckily with The Agency I’ve been able to continue to patronize their business.</text>

From the moment I signed up , my agent Perla Ortiz , sounds funny saying agent 😄,  because over the course of only a short amount of time she has become a friend ,a Big sister i can talk to with confidence, Perla has been there for me and has gone above and beyond for me , in every aspect of not only from the good but also the bad that even in the toughest moments she makes those moments into positive ones. But every other tiny aspect she has been there for me. She always always got right back to me and answered every question even the stupid one and believe me and I asked alot and she did not make me feel awkward..I know some of the things she does for me is not part of her job description but and I am beyond grateful and thankful for that ... I would recommend her to anyone in a heart beat without thinking twice.. Thank you so much Perla</Text>

In the past credit and nurturing it has never been a priority due to a naïve mindset. However, I now know the value and importance of good credit. I was compelled with my Dad's experience and hearing only great things about the services Alfred and his team at, The Agency, LLC I just knew I had to get in on this with a, "Can do attitude" and approach. I called this past Monday to inquire, signed up Tuesday, and things are set in motion Wednesday. The beginning stages to sign up were smooth. If your serious about something you'll show up differently to do what is necessary to be done. I am excited to heal my credit and continue to work with this company. So far, so good. Standby for a 3 month check in next year ;)

I was super excited about this place and so they did repair my credit. However, I would not go back to them and as I have refer some of my clients and friends I will not any longer. I always text Perla or try to get her on the phone and she never does or completes what she says. I been asking for a copy of my credit report she forgets and doesn’t send to me. She says she will call me and she doesn’t. I was looking to hire them again and she never called according to my phone log. It’s just not very customer service oriented. Good luck everyone!< /Review>

I known Perla for years. And even with a friendship I was skeptical about Credit Repair specialist and question if it really worked and worth the money.
So I see why random people would question it as well.
I can openly state. It been 6 months since I finally went to Perla for assistance.  On a professional matter I can say I should’ve done it sooner. In just 6 month I went from a FICO 628 to a 733.
Following Perlas Step by Step guidance on my financial decisions has taught me a lot along the way.
Thank you plenty Perla and I’m looking further to  the upcoming months of your services and financial guidance.< /Review>

I am a very satisfied customer of The Agency for more that 5 years. My rating is for both Tax Preparation and Credit Repair.

**TAX SERVICES**
I’ve had a hassle free experience with filing my taxes every year. The Agency has prepared my taxes for more than 5 years.  They have completed and followed through with any tax discrepancies that have risen with the IRS.
All the documentation can be filed electronically and securely with the office personal, including the final signing of the forms. The tax refund get deposited  directly with your bank account. I believe there’s an additional fee associated with it.  Rest assured that you are receiving high quality service and educated experienced professionals.

**CREDIT REPAIR**
I signed up for their credit repair services as of June 2018.  There is a monthly fee associated with the services as well as a one year contract to see results and score improvement.  The process began with a free credit consultation from Alfred detailing the plan to increase my credit score.  The Agency often sends out communication to keep me informed on methods to improve my score.  So far, it’s been a positive outcome as I’m half way into the services.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I heard about The Agency through a friend and my experience was beyond what I expected.

I reached out to Kristie Lopez, and she was and continuous to be super sweet, calm, and clear in communicating with me. She made me feel comfortable and easy for me to get started and worked around my crazy schedule.

Once I actually met the team, I knew I made a great decision.

Their front staff greeted me so professionally and insisted in catering to make me feel comfortable, even offered me coffee. (Technically they won me there since I'm a coffee addict hahah)

I was able to sit down with Danny Franco and Kristie  and my sit down experience was very informational and comfortable. Everything was smooth and easy. I was done in a very timely matter that at the end I even wanted to stay longer and file my taxes.

I highly recommend The Agency to everyone. I personally needed help with clearing up my credit.

They are so amazing that it wasn't even three weeks when I started getting notifications of improved credit and my score is going up rapidly and I get excited to check my score twice a week now vs not wanting to look at it ever!

So, Thank you amazing Team! I feel blessed to have found you all.< /Text>< pics>

I’ve been filing my taxes with The Agency for the last 5 years and there is no one I trust more then Alfred. Everyone is amazing and so friendly, but more importantly, knowledgeable and efficient.  I’ve never had any issues with my tax filing, which is very reassuring, and I have complete confidence in everyone there.  I’m not even local to the area and my tax filing couldn’t be easier.

Thank you to everyone at The Agency!  Your dedication to your clients and expertise in what you do is greatly appreciated!

I highly recommend The Agency to anyone and everyone. They will definitely take care of you!</text>

<text>The Agency LLC is the first place I have gone to to do my taxes as I usually do them myself online but I was astonished at how easy, friendly, and helpful they were with the whole process. They were quick and the best part is that they make sure you feel valued. You’re not just a customer but an individual and you can tell because they remember you by name. This is the place I will definitely go back to! Would I recommend this place to anyone? 10 times out of 10 I will recommend this place over and over again. Thank you Alfred and Perla for giving me that peace of mind I truly needed.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2d7d1d09beef3:0x6a59f78d6270ff49< /GmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

Beyond pleased with Alfred and his team's customer service. I have contacted Alfred thought text a couple of times and I always get a fast response. He goes out of his way to meet all my needs and answer any questions that I have. This time I needed copies of my husband's income taxes that are currently under his team's possession. It was an urgent matter because our son needed them to complete his FAFSA for college ASAP. Alfred contacted Jeremiah and within less than an hour I had what I needed. I admire the way  they communicate with each other and make things happen regardless of how busy they are or how big or small my need is. Thank Alfred and Jeremiah! You are an amazing team!</Text>

I'm a mortgage lender and I've worked with The agency for almost a year now. They are seriously the best at what they do.

They are very knowledgeable and keep my clients updated throughout the process, educating them on how to understand the much complicated topic of Credit.

They have a very sophisticated system that allows me to know exactly where each of my clients are at, and are a phone call away if I need any questions answered.

I would highly recommend The Agency for any of your Credit needs.<//Review>

<Review>What can I say?! These guys are amazing. Great, knowledgeable team. Always providing exceptional customer service, going above and beyond for their customers. I've had great experiences there both as an employee and later, as a customer. They helped improve my credit score from 590s to the now 730s. As a satisfied customer, I've referred family and friends for credit repair and real estate services. Ive also referred some of my own tax clients when I could not meet the specific tax needs. These guys are the best in the business!</Review>< user>

When it comes to credit everyone has a different story or need so there is no "one size fits all" solution. With that said we proudly and confidently recommend The Agency to our clients, family and friends. If you are looking to IMPROVE your credit (doesn't always have to be "repair") then make the call. Half the battle is having the courage and taking the action to call, after that you're guided. Service is top notch and the results are astonishing. Don't wait, call them today and get working on your credit not matter the reason!</Review>< pictures>

Absolute life savers. They are all more than helpful and clearly experts. What I like most is their customer service and making sure they tailor each of their services to the customer rather than vise versa.

<review>"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord." Job 1:21

It has been an amazing road working here at The Agency, LLC., I wouldn't trade any of it for the world, because I feel like it has molded me and strengthened me and made me who I am. It's not only my job but my second home. Great co-workers and I don't only have one great boss but two. (:</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I made some mistakes during my early 20's that I'm still paying for now. My credit has been in the 400's for years and I have seen a bug improvement in a matter of months. I'm now in the 500's. I know I got a ways to go but thanks to Alfred and his team I'm on track.</Text>

Alfred went out of his way to communicate with us through the refinance along with Jeremiah.  They both were available for any and all questions.  The bonus is after it was complete they still reached out to see how we were doing.  A+</Review>

The employees at “The Agency, LLC” are so caring, so professional, and with all their knowledge it made everything easier for us to understand what we were doing wrong!

<review>These guys really know how to go about fixing your credit because they went thru it themselves.  They are very professional and caring about their clients as they understand what you are going thru. There's no better time to fix your credit than now and with the Agency!</review><userid>103627995464725720240< /userid><user_name>Philip Miles</user_name></record>

I highly recommend The Agency LLC to everyone. Alfred has helped me tremendously with my credit. I was in the low 700’s with my credit and I am now at 780 and well on my way to 800. All in just a matter of about 4-5 months. Alfred is very professional and his response rate to any of my questions or phone calls was always immediate, or at most within minutes. I am now getting letters from all of the top creditors with amazing offers and zero to very low APR’s, which saves me money. Also with much higher credit limits. I definitely got my money’s worth with The Agency’s services and their prices are also very reasonable and affordable. I can’t wait to buy a new home now. I will definetly keep recommending you guys to everyone I know.<//Text>

Great Stellar customer service.  When I got there for my appointment right away I was greeted by one of the owners Alfred Cornejo and after 5 seconds  5 driferent kind of drinks where place infront of me.  For me, it was a WOW customer experience like they were expecting me.  The place is super impeccable and clean everyone there was smiley, professional and welcoming.  I recommend this place 1000% for your taxes, credit and financial needs.  They even sale cars and finance it there.  Why go somewhere else THE AGENCY LLC ROCK!!!<//review>

Came in for a pedicure. The older lady who did my feet made blisters on all my toes, one of them was all red and very sore, turns out it was ingrown. Good thing I got it taken care of somewhere else. Do not go to lovely nails and spa. Spend a little extra money to save yourself from what I went through.<//review>

This place is No Good. I wouldn't even give a star but I had to, to make this review. There's a lady there that doesn't know how to do nails my nails came out awful. A lady started them and was going to leave them bumpy and a guy there seen me tell her this is wrong then he took over and he messed up on the gel application it was all over my cuticle area. I do my nails way better then this and I don't have a certificate.<//text>

<Review>Will never go here again. The gel nail polish literally only lasted 2 days. It was like a sticker easily came off on all of them. I had clear nails and it looked ugly! And my nail broke within a week. I also disliked the fact that 2 young guys (the guy that was attending me said were the owners) were just sitting on the chair staring the whole time SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. & when I would look they would stare and talk their own language laughing SO RUDE. nothing against them speaking their own language but clearly noticable that they're talking about their ONLY costumer they had at the time. Unprofessional. Now I know why it's almost always empty.<//Review>< user_name>

None of my lengths are even, the Polish is chunky and lopsided, the acryslic isn't even blended into my nail. I'm so disappointed. They look absolutely horrible. There are bubbles in almost every nail. The man who did them basically rushed and didn't even care if they looked good himself. I'm actually livid and I'm sure as hell never going here again.</Text>< Pics>

Went in for a gel nail polish manicure. There was no soaking the nails, no trimming or pushing back the cuticle, and no oil applied prior to nail polish. With that being said when the gel nail polish was applied, he painted over some cuticle, this will later lead to the gel peeling when it grows a tiny bit. No lotion applied after, but he put cuticle oil on my fingers  (not nails) and the top of my hands and had me rub them together. Now my hands are all greasy, where if he did oil on the nails and lotion on my hands/arms it would've been better.  $23, not including tip. I've never experienced the person not soaking or using lotion before. Most the time they actually rub the lotion for you and massage your hand/arm then wipe excess lotion off with a warm towel. Would rather spend an extra $7-10 for a better experience and longer lasting manicure. Best part was way more color choices than I've ever seen!<//text>

<Review>I'm visiting from out of town and needed a Mani/Pedi. New location, new management and 15% discount special going on.  Nice clean shop, friendly staff, but......the woman that worked on me, who will remain nameless, cut one toe and one finger cuticle.  Will give another try in the future, but won't have same woman work on me.< /Review>< Pics>

I got my gel nails done and By the next day they were cracked.
Went back to get them re-done and the lady did do it but ended cutting and peeling a part of my skin back. Don't think I'll be coming here again.</text>

Horrible nail salon! Rude staff and when I asked for nail polish to be removed from my skin that she spilled on me she said no it was ok and rudely told me to pay and leave ! Never will I ever go back ! She also cut me twice made me bleed and shoved her nails into my cut to see if more blood would come out , I’m pregnant and asked for her to be more gentle with me and she rudely filed my nails harder< /Review>

IT SAYS WALKIN IN ACCEPTED!!! I walked in and the made me pay up front (no one else) then when i went again (months later ) they stated they were booked but i seen my fiance sister (Hispanic) and she took her. My thing is im a hard working single mother and on my day off i expect to be treated at least fairly at the nail shop but its ok i will promote the ending of "lovely nails"</Review>

<Text>Horrible costumer service, even if you make a appointment, they will have you waiting on a chair and let other costumers ahead of you, they don't wanna loose those costumers and they know you are going to wait for your appointment. The workers there are incompetent sloppy and rude, the only one that does a good job is the owner/manager of this place.< /Text><userid>104097394229978885135<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1459977299968</date><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

Really good noodles and broth. This place always hits the spot on chilly nights when we've come by. Servings are just right! The staff is very friendly and are generous with their condiments.
Worth giving them a try!👍🏽👍🏽<//review>

Had the shrimp curry with rice, drenched in hot sauce.
one of the best spots in town now hands down.

Amazing food at about half the price.<//Review>< gmapID>

I've been coming here for my pho fix since they opened never have I had such bad service up until this past week. I walked in to place an order to go and payed for my order. They told me it be about 40 min so I went home and returned. I gave them extra time and began my 40 min wait once I got home and left a few min later to ensure my irse would be ready. When I arrived the guy seen me and frantically begins to look for my order slip . Then another guy comes from the back to ask what my order was. I kindly repeat my order. Sadly enough my order was clearly forgotten and hadn't been made. I was told my order would be right up. I waited an additional 30 min sitting there waiting on my order. Honestly I wish I would've paid cash because with that wait I would've asked for my money back and would've taken my business elsewhere. Will I return ... never and I always would recommend this restaurant to anyone asking for a good place to eat. Now I'll wither refer everyone elsewhere and kindly warn them of the possible delays and that there order maybe be forgotten. Also while sitting there a couple came in to dine in and they placed there order and asked for two waters. Well the guy came out with waters and a new couple that had just walked in, he immediately delivered the water to the wrong table and ignored the others. Sadly enough those where the only two tables of people dinning in and me waiting on my order. They honestly need to pay attention and serve there customers in the proper order if there arrival.. did I mention worse service ever!! would not recommend !!!<//review>

Clean nice. Great service. A lot of food for the price.  Price normal. The difference is the amount of food.</review>

This spot is my preferred one. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The crew is very chummy and the cuisine they serve is so good. I am always happy to have a nice dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.</Review>

Love this place had dinner here last night & came back for lunch. Not a fancy place. Menu's need updating. But food is excellent! Broths only are outstanding.<//Review>

Best Pho in Hollister (might be the only place)! It is delicious! I get the beef pho (#6) and tai tea with boba.  Another good items is the curry with rice (not noodles). The rice soaks up the sauce, so it is filling. Pot stickers are tasty too. Lots of orders to-go while dined. Delicious!<//text>

<review>I have a store behind Super Noodle and during lunch I come here for Chicken Fried Rice everytime because it has a nice balance of meat, veggies, and rice. I take it to go and it comes out deliciously hot. My mouth is watering by just typing this review out. For lunch I can go ANYWHERE in Hollister to grab something to eat but I still choose Super Noodle.

I can't get tired of their food and the guys who work there are very nice and humble. If you are in town and looking for some hot soup then come to this place. After 3 visits to other food places, I get bored of it and stop. After 10 visits to Super Noodle I still keep coming back. I am actually planning on getting some more Chicken Fried Rice when they open today.<//review>< Time>

<Review>Very good food ,clean, service  by  Lu excellent. You must try the fresh rolls with shrimp or pork they are very healthy and great snack or appetizer. This my go to place for Asian food . The pho soup always great . Curry chicken unbelievable.. You must ask for soy noodles if dont want rice or wheat type<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Just went yesterday and it was the worst I've only been to three other pho noodle places and I already know what there supposed to taste like. They only have one kind of meat and it was thick and fatty it didn't look like the thin cut steak I always order it looked like brisket the flavor was off and the noodles were over cooked. Never coming here again.<//text>< rating>

Always looking for good noddle and pho. I  made one visit . Keep in mind this is Hollister very limited  demand for noddles. It was ok .but I don't think I'd make a special trip there unless I'm in Hollister and just have to have pho or noddles.< /review>

<Text>Liars and scammers! They charge TWICE as much as they advertise online. They claim it's because they didn't post it, yet it has THEIR address and THEIR phone number. Not coming back.< /Text>< time>

We stopped by Hollister for a quick lunch. Super Noodles was a pleasant surprise!!
The food was very tasty and great quality, we ordered spring rolls, chicken pho, pad Thai and BBQ Pork rice plate, it was so delicious!
Plentiful meat, very savory and very well marinated, the house made chili sauce really adds a nice kick.
Order the spring rolls!! So good!</text>

(Translated by Google) We no longer have to go to Gilroy here in Hollister we have this small but rich restaurant. The wines are very good especially when you are raw.

Getting in a minor accident is never fun and never convenient but Edgar and the Caliber team made my whole experience very pleasant. They were friendly and professional and I had my car back better than new in less than a week! I couldn’t ask for a better experience thank you so much! 5stars!<//text>

<Time>1618522927338< /Time><Review>I came to Caliber because USAA recommended for the repairs after my accident and they were so close to me..

So the grill in the front of my car was previously broken before the accident t and just sitting in the hole. Nahum asked me if I wanted to replace it, but I couldn't afford it at the time so I asked if he could keep the old one so I can put it back when they were done with the repairs..
What I really appreciated was that they took the time to attach the broken grill to my new bumper somehow! Little things like that really make my day.

Thank you!< /Review>< gmap_id>

This was my first car and my first accident and I was very stressed and worried about if my car could get back to it’s original condition. I was also worried about the original time span that my car was going to be ready by, since it was almost a month. HOWEVER, I was blown away by the amazing customer service and professionalism at Caliber. They were able to finish my car a week before the expected due date, it looked even better than when I had bought it, and they even washed it and vacuumed the inside for me. The manager also called me every week to give me updates and was very kind. I will ALWAYS recommend Caliber to anyone who needs auto repairs and they will be my go too from now on. They are such an amazing, honest, and reliable company. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard on my car!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>This place keeps getting better and better!  I was the unlucky victim of a fender bender on Thanksgiving.  The other side accepted liability right away, and Caliber was able to start repairs immediately.  I dropped off the car on Tuesday.  They promised me Friday, and I got a call on WEDNESDAY late afternoon it was ready!  The repairs were beautiful and great.  I really liked everyone here, from the lovely ladies at the front desk, to Edgar and Nahum - my heros.  Their office is clean and easy to find, and they have this text system that keeps you apprised of the status.  I was super impressed by the follow-up and the follow-through.  I was never in the dark.  Their customer service is top-notch.  Thank you, caliber!  You are aptly named!!!!!!  Merry Christmas to all of you!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Friendly, knowledgable and courteous.  They truly are experts overall. They give you honest appraisals and estimates for your car's improvement.  Everyone we spoke to there impressed me with their knowledge of car repairs.  Oh and the building they occupy has historical value. Check it out.</review>

<Review>This was the closest repair shop recommended by my insurance.
Pros:
-desk staff is friendly and accommodating.
-Waiting area is comfortable.
-They will arrange a shuttle to pick you up and take you to Enterprise, if needed.
-they clean your car inside and out before they return it.
Cons:
-they did not reach out to update me on the process (damage or repairs or timeline).
-Things from my car were taken.
Bottom line:
-they repaired the dent and paint scrapes to my car satisfactorily.
-they mean it when they say take everything out of your car because they won't be held liable if anything goes missing.<//Review>< pictures>

I couldn’t be any happier with the final results. My car is like new in and out. My car was extremely dirty as I’ve been having it for many years and have kids but the outcome was unbelievable my car is super clean. When I arrived for my car and seen the inside I asked if I can thank the person who did the job, And surely they brought him to me.Very nice and respectful.Thanks to the detail and keeping satisfied customers.I will defenitely recommend this shop and request for Renato! Thank you Cooks Collision!<//text>

Listen, as a young woman this was the best service I’ve ever had! Long winded but keep reading...

I got into a car accident a few months back in Atlanta and had Abra Body (Caliber Collision in GA) fix my car. I was relocating to CA soon and wanted to make sure everything was okay with my vehicle driving it so many miles across country.

I’m the middle of the 31 hour drive, my gas light came on and eventually my check engine. I tried not to panic, especially when I realized Abra (Caliber Collision) was in California too, but at the same time I was frustrated not knowing even with the the lifetime warranty whether or not they would take care of/take responsibility/ or even fix my car!

The first place I looked up was in Pasadena and when I walked in, Viviana (Front Desk Rep), was soooo nice to me! Eddie took a look at my car and after about 20 mins got me into a rental so I can continue with my day and they could fix the problem! (I was shocked expecting to be there all day) Eddie continued to let me know the status and problems that the car had (just a few things Abra in Atl overlooked) and reassured me everything would be okay. This helped me especially being a young women in a new city with a car needing to be fixed! After a week and a half, I’m picking up my car and I’m a happy girl! My car drives perfect!

I only write this because people are so quick to write reviews from a bad experience, just thought I’d share a little light, help even to anyone in need!</Text>

I picked my car up from Cook's this week and I have no confidence in the repair.  The service was terrible and the overall experience was unpleasant. Raymond did not return my calls x3 and gave me incorrect information.  Then they said the repair would take 4 weeks. They increased their price to my insurance company twice.  I think that they took them to the cleaners on the cost of the repair.</text>

<review>Where do I even begin !! I had to write this review because this place is exceptional but who really made the difference was Kendrick ! He went above and beyond to take take care of me every  step of the way ! He kept me in full contact and updated daily with my car . I really thought I was gonna Have a hard time with my car , another stress added to my life ! But nope ! He made this process stress free and a breeze ! When I picked up my car I couldn't believe what I seen they not only fixed what was broken but they went above and beyond to make it better then what it was when I left it ! I was in such awww ... Kendrick you really restored my faith in the word customer service ! You are an amazing individual . Thank you for everything ! I wish you much success ! And anyone deciding if they should go to this body shop ! Do it ! And get with Kendrick he's amazing !<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I was so disappointed with them. My friend highly recommend me to them but it turned out bad. My side mirror was broken and I went to get an estimate for repairs in a 2004 Nissan Maxima . I was quoted $572.00. They wanted to charge me $315.00 just for the mirror the rest was for labor. I told them I would call them to bring my car back to fix. In the meantime I went onto Amazon and saw the part number for my mirror for $34.95. I ordered it took it to my mechanic and he replaced it for $75.00.
BTW when I called to ask if they would fix if I bought the mirror they never returned my call. Had a bad experience with them.< /review>

<review>Dont come here if you just want a simple estimate of your car damage because THEY JUST HAVE to make you respond to your onsurance company first. They won't let you make an appt without them, so depending on wbat your situation is if you can avoid this one TRUST ME, i would.  U won't get past that slightly rude lady at the desk...but i guess she is just doing her job.....</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Went through my insurance and this place really took care of me. Fixed other parts free of charge and gave me a discount off a detail service. Friendly staff!</review>

<user_name>Zeth Satentes< /user_name><Text>I've had a horrible experience with Mossy, from the sales people, business office, and even their HR Department.
I have been misguided about the vehicle I was buying and they provided no knowledge or advice on what to do. They practically sold me a vehicle that was defective and when I tried reaching out to them, their response felt if it they were saying "Too bad, so sad".
I can't believe they are still trying to undermine people in the midst of pandemic when people are losing their jobs and homes.< /Text><rating>1</rating><GmapID>0x80dbf4edb67b0f47:0x27f08f3475da1425< /GmapID><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

<text>Went in to get a part for my car.  Easy parking, a tad crowded, though (narrow spaces).  The staff was friendly & helpful even though they were obviously busy with many customers.  Junior, at the parts desk was quite knowledgeable & efficiently found my part, got me paid & on my way in no time.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Mazzio's auto mechanics very good to very well-trained very smart and believe me whatever's wrong with your vehicle that they will find out it doesn't hurt to pay $150 to get a Sim to tell you in an hour what the problem is on your vehicle</text>

<review>I recently purchased a vehicle with Mossy Nissan not too long ago. I will say that the service was outstanding! Josh my car salesman made everything easy from start to finish. I got the exact car I wanted AND at the right price! I went in with the amount I wanted to spend (which I didn't think he would match) and he worked with his people to get them to get it down to my budget. Even working later in the day to make sure that I got everything I needed. Smooth process + Nice car = happy customer! Keep up the good work!<//review></record>

< Review>
Extra care always shown, Sandra rocked it, and gave me an A+ experience. Despite being a dealership, excellent prices and the reason for my problem was covered by the California Emissions warranty. They scan alignment automatically of every car, and did a cheap fix, which I could feel after picking up the car! When I buy my next car, they get first shot.</Review>

Shop people tell you you're wrong after you tell them something. Life car never worked on. Yet they tell you someone worked on car before they worked on the car. Tell you you can't look at paint job at that angle, 'cause shows paint runs and imperfections that they say are not there.</review>

This Service Department is clean, the drive-up bay is spacious, I was checked in within minutes. Making an appointment on line saves a lot of time. The entire exterior and interior of the Dealership is well maintained. The waiting area is comfortable and welcoming...but they do not have any snacks for Customers like most of the other Dealerships do. They do however have this awesome latte machine that you can create your own beverage.  The Service Rep was courteous and helpful. Wish I bought my car HERE in the first place instead of from the Pedder Group of Temecula/Hemet. Next one will be from MOSSY!<//text>

Mossy Nissan said they could have it back to us in a few days. They gave us a courtesy car to use while they worked on the Xterra. It looks more like it will be 5-6 days to get the xterra back. Normally that would not be a good thing. However, the free courtesy car is a 2018 fully loaded top of the line Nissan Pathfinder premium. 😂 They can take as long as they want. You won't find me complaining. They may not have kept to the original timeline, but the outstanding customer service is beyond belief. In addition they even worked with me to get me a brand new transmission at the same price that it would have cost me for a rebuilt one. 161k miles on the  '08 Xterra and it still looks like new. Only major problem I've had with it is the transmission.<//Review></record>

(Translated by Google) Very bad, I had to go back after the oil was changed, because I was getting rid of too much oil and leaving big stains on the floor and they only told me that they had put more oil on it, when in fact it was not true.

Muy malo tuve que regresar después que le hicieran el cambio de aceite, porque estaba liquidando demaciado aceite y dejaba grandes manchas en el piso y solamente me dijieron que le habían puesto aceite de mas.cuando en realidad no era cierto.<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>Besides being late...
He was polite on the phone,  but in person,  once he arrived,  he gave no greeting,  no apology for being late,  and didn't even acknowledge my presence; he just started opening my vehicle. It was very weird!
He was very off-putting and had an attitude or something.   I almost said something because he was making me upset, but I held back. I would not feel comfortable with that guy coming to help my wife.  He was just "off". Horrible experience!

If my insurance company ever says ASAP is coming to assist,  I will cancel the service and request someone else. I'm not happy.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1620881765327, 'text': 'Dear Customer - please let us know what was wrong with your experience so we can improve our customer service.

< review>
I ordered a tow through my Insurance, they showed up and called me from a number with caller I’d Deborah LEE KPC at 2:19pm. I of course did not answer as that is not from the company. I looked out the window and the tow company was outside at 2:20pm I put on my shoes and was outside 2:22pm and tow truck drove off with seeing i was outside. I called the company and they said it was canceled now and there’s nothing they could do. For 3 MINUTES. I work for Geico so I called the company. Filed a complaint.  I advised them to NEVER assign me to this company again for my Mercedes and re consider not having a contract with this money as they have so many complaints

Called ASAP to file a complaint and I spoke to DANNY D. Who sounded half asleep and was super rude and said there’s nothing he can do and he did not care.< /review>

<review>So, the towing experience was ok, however,  I insisted to the tow driver i owed $60 because my insurance didn't cover the full mileage driven and he told me "no your fine." The next day I get a call from their business and I told the woman what occurred and she acted like I was trying to SCAM them and she threatened me with a voice-mail after the phone call and said "if you do not pay i will call the sdpd to take your car." Like excuse me?
Update: I called the company back, apparently,  the tow truck driver told them I didn't ask about payment or anything, when 3 times I asked him ARE YOU GOING TO COLLECT THE PAYMENT? ARE YOU SURE? all I remember is his first name is Al, and I will never use this service again if they think it's ok to allow the employees to lie.</review><gmap_id>0x80d959d042428133:0x2184afa52797405d</gmap_id></record>

I had a flat tire and ASAP Towing was there to help. The timing was swift and the location was accurate. The driver, Jason, was very professional and kind. Needing a tow is never fun, but Jason at ASAP Towing was able to make it a good experience.< /Review>

<review>Charged $65 to replace my driver side rear tire with my spare  Took him 5 min. Took 2 min to charge my Credit card before taking off. When I tried to start my car, battery was low due to the wait. When I called to ask if he could circle back, they said it was another $65 charge.  No room to negotiate. Unbelievable. Followed up with the company and fell on deaf ears. I would not recommend using<//review>< pics>

ASAP towing was contracted through my insurance company to tow my car to the shop. Bassam arrived 10 minutes early and had to think twice of how to load my car because of the way I was parked. He was very personable and extremely efficient at his work. The whole process took about an hour from my first phone call to my car being dropped off at the shop. Thank you ASAP towing and Bassam for the great job you did for me!<//text>

Walked outside one morning to find my car wouldn’t start, so I started a roadside claim with my insurance who dispatched ASAP Towing. The technician arrived in a timely manner, but did not display any sort of professional demeanor (little eye contact, short, annoyed); I felt like an inconvenience. He claimed my battery tested fine and simply needed to charge for a while once he jump-started it.
Fast forward one week, and my battery is once again dead. I start another claim, ASAP is dispatched once again, and coincidentally the same technician shows up. This time he claims the battery tests dead and needs to be replaced (one week later??). He offers a new battery for $205, I agree and he installs it. The kicker is, the car WON’T START with the new battery, minutes after he installs it. I express concern at this, and he brushes it off, stating the battery is fine and it’s probably because it sat in his van for 2 weeks. He states that if there are any further issues to contact the battery manufacturer directly (apparently this is ASAP company policy).
Fast forward another week, and the “new” battery is dead. I get a jump start from another towing company, bring it into my actual service dealer, and they determine the battery he installed has a bad cell.
I call ASAP Towing asking for a refund, and they absolutely refuse to help me.
This company is a sham. I paid for a battery that was clearly faulty from the start, and was never tested before installation, and they refuse to offer any sort of customer service or refund. I’d advise to stay away from them!

TLDR; - ASAP dealt with me in an unprofessional manner, installed a faulty battery in my car, and refused to refund me.< /text>

Had my broken down car towed from my home in Point Loma to my mechanic in PB. I called and pre-set a time for ASAP towing to get the car. "Sony" the tow technician was on time, and very friendly. He quickly got my car up on the tow and on it's way to my mechanic. I would highly recommend ASAP towing.< /text>

<text>I went through my ins thinking it would be super simple for a flat tire change. Eta they said would be 45 mins. Hr came and no call. So I called the tow directly and they stated 10 more mins. 30 mins passed and still nothing. I contacted my ins and they contacted the tow and stated they had to get another driver enroute. No reason why and eta then said would be another 10 mins. When I disc with my ins, the tow guy called right after and adv it would be 20 mins not 10. 30 mins later he finally arrived. No apologies or anything. 2 hrs it took. If you ever go through your ins... I adv to not have them go through this Co.<//text>< pics>

Jack-ASAP Towing-Battery replacement Expert!

Betsy, my beloved Kia Soul, needed a new battery. I called my insurance company and they said somebody would be to me in about 45 minutes. Jack, from ASAP Towing, showed up sooner than expected and had Betsy's new battery, warranty included, installed in a heartbeat. He was professional, yet sociable and is so worthy of this review. Thanks Jack for a pleasant, at home battery replacement experience!</text>

<text>Had ASAP Tow out to my home to take my vehicle to the dealership. The young man was clearly inexperienced as he could not lower his bed for my car. He was on his cell and finally got directions on how to extend and lower it. He chained up the front, which then started to rub against the spoiler. He unhooked the chain, and decided to drive the car up the bed, which wasn't positioned correctly. He would have definitely caused damage to the front end. Definitely will not use ASAP Tow again.< /text>< GmapID>

I called geico who quickly got ASAP towing up to date on my situation and they sent Wasam to me within 10 minutes.

<text>Nash from ASAP Towing really saved me and made my day. First, he texted me to give me an estimated time of arrival. Then he called me 5mins early and met me on the corner exactly where I was at. What made me leave this review was his unshakable positive attitude and demeanor. I was already having a bad day, and then to lock my keys in my car topped it off. When it rains it pours. But! Nash’s positivity turned my day around. If ever I needed roadside assistance, I would rather go through Nash than Geico. He is a blessing to motorists in distress and it was an honor to make his acquaintance. Thank you again good sir!!</text>< Pictures>

<review>My car had a flat tire so I called the manufacturer road side assistance program and they dispatched ASAP Towing. It honestly took me longer to get through the roadside assistance phone call than it did for ASAP towing to come out, find my vehicle on a college campus, change my tire and get on with it. They were super professional and did it quick. I could tell the one gentlemen was training the other and even with the training it was quick. good experience and thankful.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< name>

<Review>I called a few tow companies and then I called ASAP and they were $50 cheaper!  They were there fast.   Best of all the driver "Foxtrot" was so patient and kind.  I could not believe my luck in finding this company.  Dont waste your time and money calling anyone else.<//Review>< user_name>

<Text>I've never used their service. I was backing out of my driveway and I was well into the street when one of these guys' tow trucks took a corner at 20 with a car being towed and didn't even slow for me backing out. Had I continued to back out maybe he would have stopped. I am parked right down the street from where this happened and I just saw him speed by towards the freeway. He was in a freaking *hurry*; that is so unsafe in residential neighborhoods.<//Text>< username>

<Name>Sarah R. Ramos<//Name><Review>I was suppose to write this review awhile ago but here it is. So my car shut down on me and it said I was out of gas so I got someone from another towing company to  come, which took hours just to tell me they didn't have the truck needed to tow my car so I got ASAP towing. Ghaith Alkhafaji came jumped my car and charged my battery he was so sweet he was directing people out the parking lot while he was doing it for we were kind of blocking them in.  He gave some practical suggestions but I decided to take it to the dealer instead, by this time it was almost midnight.  He even messaged me after he dropped off the car off at the dealer which the other company said would not be possible because of the time. I was given peace of mind by this young man who was very knowledgeable and professional in every way. Thanks for employing such people like him. Thanks again Ghaith!< /Review></record>

After rolling my car off the 67 highway ,CHP said they would take care of the car(getting it out of the ditch and such)and said they would be in touch took my number and info down then dropped me off a few miles from home,that was a fun day... well, they had the car towed to this impound lot. now, thankfully a good friend helped me locate my vehicle about 2-3 days after my car accident, as I was never contacted or notified of anything happening after the incident, but wait here's the crazy part. I immediately head down there ,as my good friend happens to be in the towing business and warned me they are charging for storage...I get down there and there and they gave me two options.
1)I sign my vehicle over to them and pay a fee of 400.00$ for the tow and storage
Or ;  2)pay 800.00$ for the fees and I can have my vehicle towed out of there,but not by them of course that would cost me my other leg(its great to keep a sense of humour in situations like these).
Amidst getting my car out[yes,I picked option 2;)] they tried to deny being able to take card and I had just about walked down to the trolley station for the ATM when my good friend steps up and notifies me that they are legally obligated to take card and I have come to realize that I was just minutes away from it being considered another day of storage which would have tacked a extra 200$ to my already outrageous bill. I still can't believe it, they were stalling me to scam 200 bucks off me ,don't let it happen to you most aren't as lucky as I was having that great friend to help.</Text>

<username>Kelly H</username><Time>1560809714778<//Time><rate>1<//rate><text>I have never been treated worse by another company. Ever.

Not only did they charge us $165 more than they should have. They lied to us and then turned it around and said WE were lying to THEM.

ASAP towing would not release our car to us when we came to pick it up on a Friday because we didn't have the registration in our hand. Well, we had the registration but it was in the car. We weren't allowed to see our car because we didn't have the registration. See the catch there? The guy at the lot said he checked the car but couldn't find it. This made us have to go to the DMV to get a new registration on Friday at 4:30pm.

Come Monday, my husband paid $850 to release the car to us. He opened the driver door and found his registration there on the passenger side floor. So we were frustrated.. We could have gotten our car on Friday had the guy actually looked. Not only that, they LIED and said they didn't make any mistakes, the registration wasn't in the car, and we had to pay the extra $165 to keep our car in their lot over the weekend.

I called the main office and they did not believe that we were telling the truth. They believe the registration wasn't in the car and that we kept it in the lot over the weekend because we wanted to lose the money. We spoke with Bakr Aldulaimi at the lot (the guy who "couldn't find" our registration) and we talked to the manager over the phone. We were told to call and talk to Richard Pine. Well he is conveniently out of the office every time we try to call. I'm not sure he exists..

Every dealing we've had with this company, in person, and over the phone, the people have been rude and treated us like we were smaller than them. Very unprofessional. Illegal. Dumb.

Please do not use this company - they will try to cheat you and they will most likely get away with it too.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1597248427285, 'text': 'Dear Customer - This is not up to our company standards and we will be investigating the issue with our driver.

There is a reason this company is only a 2. 7 out of 5.
the person in charge at this company has created a culture of very poor customer service.  I recommend NEVER using this company.

Please look at my profile and you'll see that I usually always give 5 Star reviews.   ASAP Towing was sent out to handle my roadside assistance for my Nissan Sentra, which had a low battery.

This company is a scam.

The Battery tech arrive 15 minutes late, crosswired the charging device on my battery, causing my battery to have a major spark.  After that the battery was completely dead.  Then he tries to sell me on one of their new batteries right away.

Have you heard of this the scam before?

This could have all been resolved by their manager and they still have every opportunity to contact me to resolve this, yet I'm confident that they won't.

The dispatcher lied to me and said he was sending a second check out and he would arrive within 10 minutes.  Thirty minutes later, the second tech had still not arrived, and I had to get a ride home because I had to work the next morning.

The first tech went back to his office and lied about arcing my battery.< /review>

My driver, Issa, arrived quickly and got me out of a not-so-safe spot. It was a hot day and he offered to let me sit in the air conditioned cab while he hooked up my car. His driving was safe and he got me to my preferred auto shop in a very timely manner. Issa was very polite and friendly the whole ride. Thank you!< /Review>

Gary showed up fast and knew his stuff. I had lost my keys and needed a tow to the dealer. Very nice and quick. I was on my way in no time.< /review>

< review>
Showed up 3 1/2 hours early to tow my car, the tow truck driver told my roommate that he was early because the insurance adjuster was at the collision center and was expecting my car... I was not home at the time so when I did get home I called the adjuster and he said that he was still planning on meeting me at my house, this caused me to have to re schedule with my insurance adjuster and borrow a car to drive to the collision center and gather my personal belongings because I was not home when they took my car I did not have the chance to gather my things out of the car...this then rolled over into me having to re schedule my pick up with the rental car center and arrange for a ride to pick up my car because of the adjusted time they could no longer offer puck up service...when talking to ASAP Towing they could pretty much give a S#*T and never apologized.... DO NOT EVER LET THEM TOW your car< /review>

If I could give this subhuman garbage zero stars and a night in jail, I would. License number 47912A2 decided that he didn't want to wait any longer in the busy left turn lane he was in. Our turn lane was clear so with about two feet of clearance he pushed himself in front of us, forcing our driver to stand on the brakes (thankfully no one was right behind us or we would've been rear ended) and come to a screeching halt to avoid a wreck. He promptly took our turn and made us miss our light, to add insult to nearly creaming us. TRASH. AVOID.</Review>

<Date>1550798608402<//Date><rate>1< /rate><Text>This tow company is a joke and a waist of time. We Waited over 2 hours. Kept calling and they wanted to prentend that they weren’t just talking to us. Asked to speak to manager/supervisor kept putting us on hold and stayed on hold for a fat minute. Kept telling us he would be here in 10 minutes. Wouldn’t give use the tow truck driver phone number and kept saying they would have the tow truck driver call us. Never got a call from the tow truck driver.  Called again. The girl stayed on the phone to see if he would call but put me on hold, so we hung up. Then they stopped answering our phone calls after they were told we were getting irritated waiting for so long. So when the driver finally decided to call to say he was “10 minutes away”, we called them back and canceled their service. The tow truck driver still came and we told him we waited to long and canceled him. Sorry not sorry.</Text>< Pics>

Edit
This place is so bad that it took them over a year to add their canned response to my review. Yes they’re really going to investigate it one year later with the driver.</Review>< pics>

Worst tow company ever.  Was sent by "Agero" through USAA.  Waited for an  hour, the no one came. Called back and tow company was still an hour away due to "traffic." What a disaster.<//review>

Terrible service, told the driver the car was going to scrape the bumper loading the car if he didn’t use boards. He said he didn’t have any. Then he proceeded to scratch my bumper, and then he grabs his boards he said he didn’t have. I would stay away, if I wasn’t there watching my bumper would have broken off.<//Review>

Pretty much the worst ever.  I am an insurance agent located in east county San Diego.  Had my car jumped by them and the offered to sell me a battery.  Since it was an interstate battery, I decided to buy it.  But, they sold me the wrong size battery.  Then they would not replace it or fix it.  I was willing to pay the difference of increase if there was one.  They actually told me to call interstate.  They were the ones that sold me the wrong size battery.  Moe, the supervisor, was callus and rude, and would not give me to his direct report.  Steer Clear!</Review>

<Text>I was very disappointed with the service of ASAP.  Just after 12 noon, I scheduled an appointment for them to come out to my job to give me a jump at 5:30 pm. At 5:40 pm. I called to get an ETA; the operator stated they were stuck in traffic nearby.  At 5:55, I called again. When they still had not arrived, I called again at 6:15 pm.  This time I asked to speak to a Manager; Moe came on the line; I asked him why the driver or the operator didn't just send another driver so that I didn't have to be stranded for such a long period of time especially since I made an appointment.  He agreed, and said he would send me a gift card for the inconvenience. I ended up cancelling the appointment since my husband (who was driving from La Jolla) arrived at 6:30.  I am also sending this complaint to Geico so that they never dispatch an ASAP driver to me again. After reading all of the reviews, it is clear there is no consistency with providing good customer service.  It's a shame that they do not care enough to improve or to provide better customer service training for their employees.  P.S.  I never received the gift card either.< /Text><GmapID>0x80d959d042428133:0x2184afa52797405d<//GmapID><Date>1511820097756</Date><UserId.>103090730908713389441</UserId.>< Pics>

I wasn't using ASAP towing services, but one of their drivers in a compact car was driving in an unsafe manner. This occurred around 6am Nov 5th, 2018 around the 32nd Street Naval Base. He cut off several cars on the 15-S by driving down the emergency lane to merge ahead of other cars in motion, then cut off about 15 cars waiting to turn onto 32nd street so he could try to get to his destination faster. Bad representation of ASAP towing, especially to San Diego military personnel.</Text>

They dont pay taxes correctly.
And they're Chaldeans and the owners of these places like liquor stores and gestations they force their own people to work under the  minimum wage i think they should get on the right track.< /text>

SHOULD BE ZERO STARS.
I didn't have my wallet or any means of funds on me but realized once I got to work that I ran out of gas. I used Honda Roadside Assistance (which was great) but they contacted ASAP towing to bring me gas. Being as I'm at work, I left my gas door open and asked that they fill it while I was working. I got several calls from the guy who came out and when I answered, he said he was at my car. I said, "Great. Gas door is open."  His response? "Are you not able to come down?" "No." "Well... I need you to come down to pay." "What do you mean? I'm covered by Honda. "I show no coverage here. I need you to come down to pay." I said I couldn't so he put me on hold while he called his company only to come on the line to inform me, BIG SURPRISE, I was covered. He asked if I could come out and sign and just like I told him before, It would be a while before I could come down. "We're good then." He said as he disconnected. WELL GUESS WHAT. He did not put ANY gas in my car at all. After a FRUSTRATING 40 minute call on the phone with some female representative advising me she couldn't do anything (you're in customer service and just doing your job. Get a new job sweetheart, they are probably treating you badly there.) I asked to speak with a supervisor who obviously didn't want to talk to me and once he finally agreed, I was accused of being a liar. No, not directly. But the response? "Oh Frank? He's been my employee for SIX YEARS. He would never lie about putting gas in your car. You just need to drive it and you'll get to a gas station." Well... I have a 2015 honda civic that shows you right away if gas was put in. I HAVE ZERO MILES available. I can't get out of my work parking lot with reassurance that there's enough gas to get to the station. Their response? Drive on it. If I get in an accident, it's not their fault cause Frank DEFINITELY put gas in. They refused to send someone else out unless my insurance paid for it (which of course, I can only request once a week so they weren't able to help.) I explained that I would be leaving a review about this unfortunate encounter with their company and his response? "Go ahead. Anything else I can do for you Ma'am?" I didn't catch the name of the "supervisor" but when I asked what they were going to do to assist me, he told me to have a great day and ended the call.
Honda was on the phone with me the entire time and was absolutely appauled. I also work in customer service and was disgusted by how I was spoken to. Their hold recording reassures you that you can count on them and they are the best in san diego. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I'd rather swallow the gasoline they DIDNT put in my car then ever have to deal with them again. Thus begins my journey to post this review on every site possible.<//review>

The driver showed up a hour early for appt time, then called and demanded I come out to the street now. He kept arguing with. I followed driver and on several occasions he almost got the car hit. Worst company ever. Calling the company doesn't help either they defend there drivers with bad attitude and driving.<//Text>

Absolutely the worst towing company in California. I've waited two hours before I finally got my service. I wish I could give it no stars. Please never use this service. Do yourself a favor and save time.< /Text>

<date>1504243769504< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>SAVE YOURSELF! PLEASE USE ANOTHER SERVICE. Had to give a star to review. Supposed to be local. Tow yard 2 1/2 miles from breakdown. Called for a tow told 45 minutes or less.  One hour later get a call from the driver he will be another 45 minutes he's in Chula Vista towing another vehicle. Call the office back we can't cancel it's $35 charge and said thier driver is really only 15 minutes away. Then driver called us back a second time and said he's rolling as fast as he can and is still unloading the car in Chula Vista. Spoke with dispatch again they lied and told us another 15 minutes because they changed drivers and got us one that was closer. Needless to say the driver did not get there for another 45 minutes, from CHULA VISTA, just like he told us. So total 1 HOUR 45 MIN from original call BEFORE driver showed up. I dont care where you are in San Diego that is enough time to get to El Cajon.
I work dispatch and if we cant get a tech there in a reasonable time, we offer the client that they may call another company who can assist them promptly. Not charge a cancelllation fee.
I have never done a review until now but after the headache and run around and literally calling them out on lying, we were given a $10 discount. Not worth it!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d959d042428133:0x2184afa52797405d</Gmap_id></record>

We were told the tow truck would show in a half hour and were waiting for over an hour and a half with it being over 100 degrees outside.<//Text>

Absolutely terrible service. Couldn't find my driver on the off ramp exit. 10/10 would rather push the truck to a auto shop than use them again.</text>

<Text>I took my mom in for an appointment recently. Office was very clean and we had a great 1st visit experience! Office staff were professional and friendly. My only one little complaint may be is that we waited quite awhile after the cleaning was done to see the Dr for the exam, but she was very kind and thorough with the exam. I would definitely recommend this office.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x152fb1b6dabf4b69:0x62ff7a4060555e56</Gmap_id></record>

Yesterday I had the most wonderful experience at a new dentist office. I got my teeth cleaned and they were so impressed with how well I take care of my teeth. Only had 3 cavities. It was so relaxing while I got my teeth cleaned I almost feel asleep. The office staff was very accommodating to my wheelchair and my latex allergy. If you have Calviva first choice I HIGLY recommend Dr. Irasuta and her dental office. Oh I love how they sent frequent reminders through text messages. I felt like they were really looking forward to meeting me. The doctor explained every step she was performing on my teeth and what to expect.<//text>

Its a great service and friendly place. I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a dentist for their child. My first time with my two kids are great. Just one of my kids dont want to get exam and clean but he did great. This is the first time for my kids too but my daughter seems to like it. Overall, its a great experience with the dentist and assistance.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This place is the best ,they get down to business no setting around for 2 hours waiting to see the nurse. From the front desk to the dentist assistant top of the line. The dentist assistant was very polite and gentle when it came to doing x rays an cleaning, she did not shove the mouthpiece in my mouth like she was feeding me a t bone steak or something an she did an awesome job cleaning my teeth very good work colgate smile for real. she was very careful not to bother the tooth that was sore she was just a gem. the head nurse was top of the line she asked questions an gave suggestions on what would be the best way to go on getting my tooth fixed., very professional the hole staff was. i'm not one that's easy to please sometimes but i would recommend this dental office to anyone that's trying to get quality service . the best i've been to hands down.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Wow. I sadly haven’t been to the dentist in over 10 years. Recently found out I had dental insurance and was referred to Dr. Irasusta office. Was scared. Doctors Assistant didn’t get her name but she had a high bun that day was wonderful. She understood that I was terrified and while doing my cleaning she took her time and was explaining everything she was doing and kept asking if I was okay. Today I had my appointment for my two fillings. Got called in within a few minutes. Wanted to cancel because my son was getting out of school in a hour. But I let them know and work around that. Lucky two fillings literally took 30 minutes. They were fast but patience knowing I was worried and the fillings and picking up my kids. Only thing I didn’t like was that they only did one white filling and the other silver. I know that medical now covers for white fillings. Also pricing for a crown is crazy high. I was quoted $950 for one. But other then that I really liked everything and everyone.<//text>

<review>Dr. irasusta and her staff are wonderful ! I'm not a big fan of "going to the dentist" but if I have to go, this is the best place to go ! The staff is always professional and friendly!  Dr Catherine is great too! I feel fortunate to have them as my dental office !</review>< Rate>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>I've been a patient with Catherine for almost a decade and by far one of the best Dentist in town!  I'm always welcomed by their warm and friendly staff.  They are always very good on reminding me on my next check up and very quick on getting me in and out of the office.

Dr. Irasusta very precise with her work and always making sure I'm comfortable with all my exams.  I've recommended many of my close friends and family to her and they've all were pleased of the great work and friendly staff she has.  You rock Dr. Irasusta!</review>< Name>

<review>I've been on the search for a new Dentist and tend to steer away from dental chain groups or large offices based on my preference and experiences with dental offices. I did some searching on local providers and was pleased with the positive feedback prior patients and colleagues had to say.

Dr. Catherine Irasusta has now been my new Dentist for just under a month and couldn't be more happy with my choice for a new Dentist. I've included some of the key things I personally pay attention to when visiting a office. I've been to the office about 4 times as of this review .

- Office Cleanliness: The office waiting area/lobby has been very clean the few times I've been in so far as well as nicely decorated and inviting. And as of recent, nicely decorated with Christmas decorations and like who doesn’t like Christmas Decorations during the happiest time of the year!? Magazines are also available to browse through while you wait which by the way (won’t be long)..

- Wait Time: This is always a make or break for an office. I'm pleased to say my last four visits have always been right on time as scheduled, my most recent appointment was even called back 5 minutes prior to the scheduled time which is a plus!

- Office Staff: Dr.Irasusta has an amazing team! Starting with the front desk staff which are always friendly and great at explaining any questions you may have pertaining to your insurance/ and any out-of-pocket costs you may have. The dental assistants and hygienist are really great too! Overall have had great experiences with the staff.

- Quality of Care: Most importantly, Quality of Care? Dr. Irasusta is extremely thorough in examining your teeth. She provides a clear treatment plan, answers and explains and questions/concerns you may have and she's also very friendly and personable! You will definitely take notice of how experienced and knowledgeable she is.

Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my choice in leaving my Dental Care with Dr. Irasusta and her staff. If you're searching for a new Dentist or perhaps don't feel like you're getting the service in some of the key points I've noted. I'd definitely recommend to give their office a call and schedule an appointment!

Thank you Doctor Irasusta and staff for making me feel GREAT when I smile! You all are amazing!!

With sincere appreciation,

Very disappointed.  Teeth were not cleaned completely.  Also was told that I have an infection and need to see a specialist. No antibiotics offered. Called two days later, asked if I could get antibiotics until I could get an appt with the specialist.  Nurse checked with Dr., returned in phone said no infection seen on latest x-Ray. Told them I only had one x-Ray. Was told I could return for another x-Ray at my cost.    Frustrated!!!!!<//text>

< Review>
I went to Dr. Irasusta's office after nearly a decade of not having gone to a dentist because a bad experience scared me away. As a result, I ended up needing a few root canals and cavities taken care of. Dr. Irasusta and her hygienists were absolutely great. They're meticulous, friendly, and professional, and made me feel more at ease at a dentist's office than I've ever been in my life. The hygienist who did my yearly cleaning also got rid of the stains on my teeth that my previous dentist had told me were permanent. I'm very impressed with their work and highly recommend Dr. Irasusta and her staff to anyone seeking a dentist.</Review>

<text>Exact Leak Detection is AMAZING! Don't hesitate to hire these guys, they are hard working, and professional and ended up saving me a lot of money since the broken pipe that they repaired was found outside underground (another company said the broken pipe was inside and they wanted to jack hammer my entire living room and bathroom to get to it when the broken pipe wasn't even there!!!) So glad I made the right decision to go with this company and on top of that the owner of the company himself called me several times and coordinated a speedy repair and the workers finished the job ahead of schedule!!! A+++ service Thanks!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUarhxqt3qn34bFWOEo4_SxnjV9goeEA40zQ-C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrQc36ccpCT7rsn_UTpfcWIWpScStt7XG41EA7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdlFDTDwm38rBJWIhbovSOUD5vKb_fT3IpjN06=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORVBNW3UOFRlZwEOTPzngdeVxmOnaMEJFjzmBt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Great professional service! During the pandemic is not an ideal time to have a water leak, but Exact  made it as painless as possible. They were about to get someone out immediately for inspection and completed the work first think the next business day.

Anthony & Abdul were on time, professional, and practiced safety precautions when entering our home. Thank you so much for the great service! I will definitely recommend your business in the future!</Text><GmapID>0x80dcb117984cb1f5:0x7f862aa21b93a00a< /GmapID>< Pictures>

Exact Leak Detection was the only company to come to our home the Sunday of Memorial weekend, when we had a slab leak. Alonzo, was very through and explained what needed to be done. Eric and Abdullah were the two young men to complete the re-route of our hot water pipe. We appreciate their professionalism and pleasant personalities while working in our home. We would definitely recommend this company to family and friends.<//Review>

This was my first time using Exact Leak Detection and what a great experience. Alonzo found the leak right away and fixed it.  The best part was how quick they were able to come out and fix. I would definitely recommend their service.  Also, they followed all covid protocols to keep my family safe.  Thank you.< /review>

< review>
I have used exact detection a number of times in my home due to leaks in the pipes and their work has always been extraordinary, On this occasion, we had the wax seal ring on two toilets which they completed with great care and to their highest standards. While here, I got them to replace all of my angle stops and flex through the house as part of routine  maintenance as the hard water means they will stop working when you most need them. They also took care replacing faucets in two bathroom.

Thank you Aaron for your excellent work :-)<//review>

Anthony from Exact Leak Detection arrived on time and was very professional. He explained the process in detail and set expectations clearly. Once the leak was identified they were able to replace the leaking pipe right away and explained next steps. The dispatcher also provided prompt communication during the entire process and was very responsive. We are very satisfied with their service.</Review>

Very happy with the work done by Abdullah and Jose from exact leak detection. They called prior to arrival, worked efficiently, answered all my questions, left my home clean after work, and even made time to fit in an additional service we found out we needed. They rerouted our hot water line and it works GREAT. Thanks!</Text>

<review>Beware! I called company because I had a high water bill according to my water company I had a constant leak, when they came out to my house they told me I had a leak spraying underneath my foundation and I needed to re-pipe my house so I said OK let me get back to you.I called another company out in the same area to give me a second opinion and it turned out that my toilet upstairs was constantly running therefore I had a high water bill and I did not need a complete re-pipe on my house which would’ve cost over $10,000, please do your homework before you even call this outfit.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Water leaks never come at a convenient time.  The leak was determined to be in the water main coming into the house.  There was a crew of 4 the next morning replacing the broken pipe.  They were on time, worked efficiently, completed the work in one day and the results are extraordinary.  I would recommend this company to anyone needing the services they provide.  Their customer service staff are polite and helpful, cheerful and had the answers to all my questions.  Excellent organization.<//text>

The work was done in a timely manner, and done adequately. After getting the work completed I later realized I probably could of got it done for a lot less. Seeing as how I needed it done, I payed for the convenience of them already being available< /Review>

Had a slab leak and this company was recommended. Going with Exact leak detection was the best decision ever! This 6 man crew showed up and completed the work in one day! They were punctual, personable, professional and super knowledgeable. Big thank you to Alex, Erik, Mario, Jose, Carlos & Florencio!! 🙌🏾<//Text>

<text>Eric and Mario of Exact Leak Detection came out on Monday, May 25, 2020 to see about unclogging our hot water line which had a blockage in it.  They were extremely professional and were able to resolve the problem quickly and efficiently.  We would highly recommend this company and both of these gentlemen</text>< user>

Wow! We had a slab leak and Aaron Caldwell and Alex arrived on time, reviewed the plan with us (including insurance details), and got right to work. In this COVID-19 era, they wore masks, and were amazingly courteous and friendly, but most importantly--they figured out the problem, fixed it, reviewed it with us, and cleaned it all up. Too bad the rating system only goes to 5 stars. They are a 10-star team! We're so, so grateful. And...we can take showers tonight!</text>

They did an awesome job, sealed the area to prevent dust getting into the rest of the house and left the area in a very clean condition! Aaron did a awesome job identifying the extent of the leak problem and recommended and coordinated the most cost effective solution! Highly recommended!!!</text>< pics>

I would like to thank Exact Leak Detection, for their superior work ethic.  The team took the time to explain to me exactly what was wrong and where the water leak was. How much it was going to be, what time and how long it would take. I am so happy to find a company that is honest right up front. No added charges when the job was completed on time I might add. I was so happy to see how clean the area was, in my opinion they went above and beyond to ensure that I was happy. I am pleased to say if you need anything plumbing this is the company to call. You will not be disappointed. We will always use them and recommend them. Thank you for your service it was a very pleasant experience from start to finish.<//Text>

<resp>None</resp><Text>This Company was chosen by my Insurance and was not at all happy with the service and outcome.  I have been in this home for approximately 2 mos.  I had property inspection done in July 2019 we closed a Escrow in September.  The house was completely remodeled inside and out. I reported water damage to flooring after noticing it felt squish after shower was used. .  The inspector sent from Exact leak did not give me a secure feeling.  I was alone and he didn’t seem like a professional.  He was more interested in a personal conversation than doing what he was sent to do.  Once he completed his investigation I did not hear back from them or Insurance co.  The bathroom is a guest bathroom and shower is very seldom used and we have not be in home long enough for them to report normal wear and tear.  I was very dissatisfied with the report and had to get a second opinion. The 2nd inspection determined it was a sudden incident and now I find myself going back and forth with insurance to get this claim covered.  I do not recommend this company at all.<//Text></record>

The exact leak detection is recommended by me by my hazard insurance Mercury. They are fast and quick team. They are doing slab leak rerouting in the kitchen island. A good hardworking team, they know what they are doing. I will be recommended them to my neighbors, friends and family.< /review>

<Review>Was put in contact with Exact Leak Detectors via AAA Insurance as I didn't want to have to stumble through the yellow pages to find a plumber I could trust. Exact initially came out just to locate the leak in our home and did that well. Erik, their Rep assigned to my case, was also able and willing to go ahead and also repair the leak in the same visit. Saved time and money!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I found Exact Leak through AAA Insurance. These gentlemen are very professional and meticulous. They dug up the cement in my kitchen to investigate a potential leak or pipe breakage.  It turned out to be a 15-foot pipe blockage. They patched it up and kept my kitchen clean.  Finished the work in one day.  The entire crew worked very hard.  Highly recommend Exact Leak to anyone.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Exact Leak Detection came out after we contacted AAA Insurance. With water damage in our kitchen and our attached neighbor we pretty stressed about having to rip out cabinetry and other bigger repairs. Tech Aaron came out and it took him about 20 minutes to exactly pin point the issue of a leaky pipe behind the refrigerator. He explained the issue, cut out a small hole and fixed the leak, so we could start the drying process. He also suggested proactively replacing the main valve. All at a fair price and very professional. Highly recommended.<//review>

<Text>We were without water for several days due to a leak from Main to house. Others were going to take longer and charge much more.. Erick and others from Exact Leak said they would do it next day, and initially were at a lower price. Once there the run was longer then anticipated so the price went up, but within reason.
We had a couple of problems, but I understand things happen, but they worked very hard and long into the day...well past normal hours. They made good on the work they agreed to do, and did it as promised. All up front and on time... sadly something we don't see much of today anymore!
Good Job Erick and All who worked out there making my 92 year old mother with water once again as promised!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I was referred to Exact Leak Detection through my Insurance Company (Wawanesa).  This was the first time ever dealing with a claim as a first time homeowner, and Exact Leak detection made the anxiety & fear go away! Technician Toribio & Abdullah were the ultimate professional, punctual, and took the time to explain to me what what was causing the slab leak, and how they would resolve the issue. I would recommend giving them a call if you have any plumbing issue.</Review>

<Text>Not happy! This company came to my house and said they were experts in water leak detection and charged $275 to do a leak detection because my floors were hot. They could not find the leak and left after charging me. So the next day I had another company in corona that did a free leak detection and found the leak and fixed it in the same visit. Not sure why I was charged $275 and no leak was detected while another found and fixed the issue in 24 hrs later.<//Text>< pics>

We went there for sandwiches today because a friend had recommended this place they weren't getting the sandwiches were awesome very generous and very homemade type it was only $6 for my turkey and cheese sandwich plus I got a free soda it was delicious and so big I could only eat half.
My husband and I highly recommend this market for homemade deli sandwiches and the staff was very kind and friendly they are also we also looked around the store and they carry a huge variety of items check it out<//review>

<Review>Very nice people working here.  They always seem to have what I need.  The beer selection is good and prices are better than Bev Mo down the street.  Stop here first but enter through the second entrance on Burt Street.  That first one is too close to the intersection and I have seen several people almost get rear-ended trying to pull in the lot.<//Review>< GmapID>

I mainly go there for there salad bar, even though the Coronavirus epidemic prevents you from putting your salad together yourself. But this particular location in Jackson has messed up my order the last 2 times I've went there, resulting in me having to wait an extra 30-45 minutes for them to remake it.

Round Table Pizza in Jackson is one of my favorite lunch spots.  The facility is clean and well staffed, and the salad bar is filled with fresh, crisp, and wholesome vegetables and other toppings for a salad.  Proteins in the form of hard boiled eggs, beans, and cottage cheese are also available.  And the pizza is good too. The restaurant is easily handicap assemble.< /Text>

The service was fantastic. My mans Jose was quick and strait forward with the order. He stayed the food would be out in five minutes, and it was out in five minutes. On a scale of one to two this round table was a solid two. I hope that my home boy Jose goes on to win the power ball lottery. A two dollar tip was not enough for this mad lad. He was the hero we got but not the one we deserved. I hope everyone else has a good experience as we did.< /Review>

Terrible service, terrible management. I watched the employees mess up on the same order 3 times in a row and the manager said nothing however at the same time a new recruit was getting dogged for uneven toppings and washing his hands too much. To top it all off none of them wear their masks correctly including management<//text>

Round Table Pizza is one of those places where you can count on the same quality food each time you visit. Personily I enjoy the wide selection of always fresh veggies at the salad bar</Text>

<Review>Dining room and ladies room were extremely messy at 2:30 pm on a Friday afternoon.  It was not busy yet had to wait at the counter to order.  The manger had to run to the grocery store to buy coffee as they were out.  No forks at the salad bar.  Fresh pot of coffee was made yet was cold when served and had to be reheated.< /Review>< pics>

I haven't eaten at a Round Table for 20 or more years...... and now I know  why. They are they most expensive,  greasy and flavorless pizza money can buy. Service was polite, good Salad bar (overpriced as well)and it was clean; just don't eat the pizza< /Review>

<text>The ambience was okay.. the service was really good.. the food was good.. I had requested medium spicy..

I had ordered paneer Biryani, which is one of the signature dishes of Tabla, previously it used to be a different taste, which I love it, but now they gave me with the usual ullavcharu masala, which was a lil disappointing, but yeah it tasted like a ullavcharu biryani with paneer.. no issue with the taste.. it was good..

Quantity for the price is as usual amazing.. we had to Togo the rest..</text>< Resp>

Really loved their food. We ordered idli, vada and masala dosa which were really well made and served with very good quality chutney and sambar. The quality of food was very good, they didn’t cut corners on the quality of ingredients like other restaurants. Same with egg fried rice and baby corn manchurian we ordered later.<//review>

I have been wanting to try its lunch special. I tried its dinner and I liked it. The problem for this place is service. First time there, we sat down first but they took order to people who came later. We waited for a long time and no one bothered to check us until we waved. Lunch special offered a lot of dishes. All the dishes are salty and spicy. Not as good when I came for dinner. Friday lunch time was packed. There was a line. I think dinner time is better if you don't want to wait.<//text>

I have tried biryani in many major cities, small towns, Devon street, Edison, etc etc. And I have to say that this place has the best biryani that I've ever found. Highly recommend the Avakai and Paneer biryani. Is very spicy, cooked freshly. We've always done take out, never dined in.<//review>

Tikka masala was ehhh... naan n curry has better. Probably the worst lamb biryani I’ve ever tasted. It was just straight up spicy. Garlic naan was soggy... Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I don’t know but I was disappointed. Not worth the price in my opinion.< /Review>

Wanted to share my experience.  I ordered a to-go item with butter nan.  I picked up the item and by the time I reached home (around 10 mins), I noticed that Nan had become very hard and was not edible.  I could not eat it.  I called this restaurant to inform about the the Nan.  I was expecting an apology.  Instead of that the manager (I think name was Samar or something) started kind of lecturing me that Nans are made that way as If I have never eaten one.  The tone of manager was as if customer was lying about problem with Nan.  I understand that there are subjective things such as taste of food  etc where you could argue with customer (even then it is a bad idea),  but Nan being too hard is demonstrable fact and there was no need to argue.

A very basic rule in restaurant business is (or any business) to hear customer's criticism and improve.  Also if customer is calling about the quality of food or service,  make amends and not argue.  Any restaurant business that blames customers for quality of food does not know the basic rules of running restaurant business.

I think owner of this business has hired incompetent manager and other staff to run his business.  Unhappy customers would go to other places specially in Bay area where there is no shortage of Indian restaurants.</Review>

One of the best Chicken Chilly I ever had in my life. I tried it for the first time and it won my heart seriously. Highly recommended.< /Text>

The food was much better than expected and they served it pretty quickly. My only concern was that they were very hasty to have us leave the restaurant even though we arrived more than 35 minutes before there stated close time. You should serve your customers all the way to close, otherwise set a different close time. Other than that the staff were friendly and the restaurant was relatively clean.</text>

I don't think they got trained on how to treat a customer. They say we get 10% discount on online order but that's just to get customers in and once you are in, you have to pay full price. Asking for it, you get good walkthrough of how to use a website where its very hard to find the discount. I am not satisfied with that service and I am never gonna give them my money again.<//review>< Pics>

Update - 02/02/2020
It became the worst now. Writing this after eating bad biryani from last 3 visits.
NO MORE TABLA....!!!!
No salt, No flavor, it’s just white rice with some Salan.
Eggs shells are free with biryani.
Chilli paneer has just food color and corn flour.

Last review from DEC/2019
Best biryani in town at the moment. Hope they continue to keep the standard same.</text>

I’ve been to Indian and Sri Lanka, eaten the local food. Lived in London, ate at many curry places. This place is as good as it gets. In facts it’s better. The taste is second to none. The smell of these curries is just amazing. I swear you won’t be disappointed with this place. I’ve not found better.< /review>

Dahi vada was thin watery yougurt with old vada. No salt, sugar spices or tempering of any kind.

With the price tag this high , what are you guys cooking and serving?</text>< user_id>

Very bad service.Yesterday I went to Tabla restaurant with my family.I have ordered 4 items and they gave us starters after 20 min and then they didn't serve us food for more than an hour.In the mean while we were asking the people to check on our order.One person was smiling and another doesn't really care.So, It has been more than 1 and half hour. and the people who have come later got but not us.so we decided to go .Then I tried to be gentlemen and paid for what they have served and wasted my time.The good part is no one was sorry or apologized about it.Any ways My friends with please try to learn how to treat and provide service to the customers especially in this part of the world.ledha bandhchesko<//Review>

I like the food but the customer service is awful.
Wait times are disastrous and multiple times I had to cancel my order.
I'm sure they can do a better job in customer service, addressing their needs and serving them on time. This is a busy time isn't always a good excuse. Every restaurant has their busy times yet they work on managing the hours and man power.</review>

Amazing food, nice casual atmosphere. The Chole Bhatura is particularly tasty. This is quite possibly the best Indian restaurant in the Peninsula.</review>

<Text>Update- I now use Yelp to order takeout. They still don't pickup calls.  Increasing the rating since their food is good..

This is for their front desk. They don't pick up calls and are not even apologetic about it. I told them they are losing business due to this but it looks like they don't care.!!</Text>< Resp>

<Review>BEWARE FOOD POISONING!!!

I ordered Biriyani and chicken tikka masala through uber eats. The delivery was prompt but after eating the food me and my wife started having stomach pain.
We both had severe food poisoning!!!

Stay away from this place!!</Review></record>

<review>I've tried many biryani nearby, this place has the best! Order the chicken one, with bone-in, as the boneless one or the fish one is usually over seasoned and on the salty side. I also love their samosa, highly recommended!< /review>< gmapID>

This is one of the most authentic Indian restaurants I've ever been to. I love how the Indian workers wear opened toed sandals. They also dress like they do when they all ride on that train (Google Indians on train if you need to see). The food was pretty spicy. If your white be careful. Service was pretty good. Overall a solid 5/5 stars for this place.</Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Yes, it is definitely a good place to eat Indian food. The menu choices are also good. The ambience is also fine. They are located in a very good place.

They also have a proper free parking available.

The reason for 4 stars is two things. First, The service needs to be improved. To get a plate for 1 person in our group, we had to follow up almost 3 times. Also one item in our order was not brought untill we reminded for it, took a lot of time.

Second, one item that was ordered was cold, and was almost like it was taken out of the Refrigerator, heated in a microwave and given to us, parts of it was still cold.

However, all these happened over a busy day there was huge crowd. On a normal day the case might be better.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I haven't been here for awhile but they changed the menu for the better. Got the paneer dosa which now comes in four pieces and the sambar was delicious. The reason for the four stars is that we ordered idly and it was never delivered, we ordered some pav bhaji as an appetizer (which was good) and was given to us after our main meals were given even though we asked for them to be brought out first.  Last but definitely more important GO OVER YOUR BILL BEFORE PAYING, I ordered a mango lassi and the bill stated it was for $80, once I told the guy he fixed it but still he just pointed at the credit card machine expecting me to pay $141 for a $57 ( difference is because the tax on $80 drink.)meal.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808f9e80addce7cb:0x174b3f24aa964a62< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is the worst restaurant I ever been in bay-area.

No restrooms, the bowls are filthy and the it will take 40 mins to get what you ordered even though there is no crowd.

Never order any kind of biryani if you are expecting hyderabadi one.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Customer service has been going down with every order I place. Have been a loyal customer for about 6 years, but now it's more a hassle talking to them compared to other options available around the area. Seems like at some point every thriving business gets complacent.< /review>

This restaurant is bogus! There is rubbish everywhere; cleaning carts with food spillage all around the restaurant. We were about to be seated next to a cart full of dirty dishes, and we refused and had to wait for twenty minutes for a different table. The department of sanitation should check into this issue as it is a potential health risk. We ordered appertizers and entrees for our table, and they decided to bring everything at once. The food quantity is very low. The quality and taste of the food was okay. We were sitting in the restaurant and requested an additional appetizer since we were still hungry at 9:15 and told us that they would not serve us since they were closed, but they close at 9:30. They did end up bringing the appetizer after we insisted, but meanwhile they brought the check to our table and appeared impatient. Overall, the service was very poor.<//review>

<review>It said that the restaurant closes at 3:30pm and we went in at 3pm and they put up the closed sign on the counter immediately as we entered! And when we asked why, they said only “take out” is available between 3pm and 3:30pm! Well then why did you put up the closed sign? No Indian restaurant has done that before! If your door is open, and if you’re marked as open, and if you advertise 3:30pm as your closing time, you should honor that and serve your customers accordingly. If not, put up a sign that says so. Don’t just “close” the counter as your customers walk in!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Amazing authentic Indian food. A good rule of thumb is that when you are going to a restaurant that is from a certain culture it is good to see people from that cluture eating there. One issue is service. Their service is not amazing, but their food definitely makes up for it.< /Review>

This place is soooooo amazing.  The atmosphere is not the greatest, but it works and you forget all about it as soon as you start tasting the amazing food.  I will say this is the best Indian food in the bay area.< /Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Tabla  is a good Indian restaurant for Indian cuisine s.we ordered vegetable dum biryani,rava masala dosa and chole bhature.Biryani is very tempting , spicy (will not suggest for kids),bhatura was soft and chole perfect.rava masala dosa is also good.Raita also served with biryani this makes biryani less  spicy.If you want some more spices in Biryani they serve masala chutney also .Tea is also very good in taste,they serve this complimentary.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Good foods for reasonable price. We had boneless chicken biriyani, chicken fried rice, chicken Tikka masala and naan bread. Rice tasted very good. Tikka masala was sweet and was different from what I had before. Fast service. I recommend this place to friends.</Text>

I'm a vegetarian and I love the food here. The paneer biryani is a must-try item. I also like the masala dosas. One sabzi to try is the kadhai paneer with a garlic naan. My mouth is watering now :p</Review>

We didn’t expect such awesome food.  The waiter was very friendly.  My kid loved the kids cone dosa so much she took a second one.  In total all the food from veg spring rolls to the non veg thali were spectacular.  We hope to eat at Tabla again next time we come to San Francisco.</Review>< pics>

The Food taste was very very bad and spoiled. They don’t know what customer has ordered and what food they prepared.
Very much disappointed with the order, I never recommend any one to visit this restaurant and waste your money.</text>

worst service. rude manager.

I requested sambar 6 times and waited for 45 mins just for one bowl sambar. He was passing by our table but he did not bring it. So I wrote bad service and got out. One of my friend went there few days back and that guy told service will be same you want to eat or not ? It is very bad manner to talk like this. Instead of improving or addressing, he behaved rudely.</review>

Not a good Experience with their service. They seemed rude in their conversation. When I asked to refill the tea dispenser with more tea; I was told they allow one cup per person and not more; which is out of context reasoning.<//text>

<Review>Best briyani and the rest of other items are bit up to the standard. They can have more veg options as well. If they serve an Andhra meals with pappu and dhaal. I guess it will be a huge hit.< /Review>< Pictures>

The food is okay, sometimes even good :) but the service is awful. If you are a group and order multiple items, they arrive at different times which makes for a terrible dining experience. Every single time that I've been here, one of us has had to wait to get their food long enough that someone else in the group was done.</review>

One the best budget Indian restaurants you can find in northern Bay area (excluding sf). The menu options are good for vegetarians (I'm a vegetarian)
Items I liked - Veg biriyani, Egg biriyani, Lunch thali, Chana Batura and Rava dosa.< /Text>

Authentic Indian food at super reasonable price!

This is by far the most authentic Indian food we had in the Bay Area.

It’s located in the a shopping area so there are plenty of parking spots which make it convenient.

We visited at dinner time but it was fairly empty. It’s a simple, causal Indian restaurant so don’t expect anything fancy or much service.

Masala Dosa (5/5)
Butter Chicken (4/5) a tad too sweet
Garlic Naan (4/5)

This is going to one of our regular Indian food spot now!< /text>

< Review>
This rating is based solely off of one dish that they prepare: Vijayawada Chicken Biryani, aka the best Biryani in the Bay area and arguably my entire Biryani experience.

If you're from the area, you know how many options there are for good Indian food, so you'll understand when I say that I only go to each place for a couple exemplary dishes (not the whole menu). Well for Tabla, that's the Biryani mentioned above!

Don't come for the dining experience, the ambiance, the service or the music. Come for the only thing that matters here, the Biryani!

The aroma is enticing, smelling strongly of a refined selection of rich Indian spices. Unlike many styles, this one has the rice on top and the chicken baked underneath (of which there is a surprisingly good amount). Large portions, soaked in a fantastic curry accompaniment, you just can't go wrong with this one. The spice level is great - not too much so as to make those with low tolerances cry but enough to make the more acclimated stop intermittently and appreciate the flavor (while giving their tongue a quick rest). Plus the raita is perfect to help relieve the burn (and alleviate digestion troubles by protectively lining the stomach).

As mentioned, I can't speak towards the dining experience, or really the rest of the menu (except for some unsurprisingly mediocre tandoori chicken).

My sole recommendation is that you order the Vijayawada Chicken Biryani! And if you're like me, get an extra to go (because it only gets better).< /Review>

Good spot for authentic Indian food.  The vadas were a little undercooked and soft, but the goat biriyani and dosas were on point.  The portions are also very large.< /Text>

Good, inexpensive Indian restaurant serving up a wide variety of dishes. This is a second branch of the one in Foster City. We got the butter chicken, saag daal and the tandoori chicken, the typical Americanized Indian dishes. Everything was tasty, the butter chicken was slightly on the sweet side. Next time I will definitely try their madras chicken and other dishes.</Text>

Tabla has great Indian food. We ordered chilli paneer and chole bhatura for dinner. The taste was really good. The panner was soft and was properly cooked. Similarly the chola bhatura was also delicious. My colleague was also impressed by this place. Just one suggestion, the ambience and the wash room can be improved a little.< /Text>

The food at this place is amazing. We split the vegetarian thali with roti and the idli appetizer dish. It's not the best Indian food I've had but definitely makes to the top list. I would go back for more. The only thing I would suggest that the restaurant work on is the service speed. We arrived around 12.40 pm, there were a couple of busy tables, but most people left by 1.20 pm. However, the servers were slow albeit being very friendly.</text>

<review>UPDATED REVIEW
----------------------------
Reducing to 3 stars. I have been here 5-6 times during lunch and every time I have experienced it.
The pressure cooker whistle starts off all of a sudden and its pretty loud. It goes on for a minute at a stretch at least. And it goes off 4 -5 times one after the other. I think you can imagine how the experience gets like when you are eating and at times it gets too annoying. You can't even hear what's the guy next to you is saying.
To the owner, I am sure you can come up with a better plan to get rid of the whistles when people are having their lunch. Just soften the lentils (or whatever it is) beforehead !!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW
----------------------------
Quite a bit of food in the price.
They have complimentary Indian milk tea as well which tastes great.
I had ordered for the Non veg thali which came with 3 non veg curries (2 chicken and a goat curry), a daal, a rasam, yoghurt, yellow rice, plenty of white rice, naan, sweet, papad.
I was not able to complete the thali and the food tasted great.
I was happy to see that they serve fresh chapati as well. The seats and tables needs to be lot more cleaner.
The staffs are nice. There is plenty of parking space in front of the restaurant.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1545674336044, 'text': "We are sorry that we couldn't satisfy you.

<review>I do not understand the 4.2 stars that this restaurant has. I made the mistake of taking my colleagues here.  Everyone had stomach problems.

The dessert (gulab jamun) was below par. The sambar was unbelievably bad.

Comimg from an Indian - The food does not deserve anything over 2 stars.<//review><Time>1504231279154</Time><gmap_id>0x808f9e80addce7cb:0x174b3f24aa964a62<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
These guys close 20 mins before the closing time even though if you are inside the restaurant they will ask you to leave the restaurant by closing time without even letting you finish the food . I don’t know why they keep closing time 2:30 when the don’t follow it .
P.S No complaints about the food< /Review>

< Review>
Went to this restaurant today evening with my family,the restaurant was not so busy when we went but none showed up to take the order,we waited for so long and finally when i went to the front desk there were two guys standing and talking to each other without caring for the customers,the order was taken late and the food was delivered late as well,this is not a good thing for the restaurant management to hire such unwanted and careless waiters in the front and we will never return.< /Review>
