Truly was speedy and their prices are on par with other places or better. Driver Daniel was awesome, funny, and nice. Not only that but he sent messages to give me an idea of when he'd be there and then when he actually arrived. Will definitely order again.  Thank you guys :)<//Review>

< Review>
Order a speedyweedy cartridge "super lemon Haze" . Opening it I saw a big air bubble and it didn't look like a full cartridge. I let the oil set down and it still wasn't a full cartridge ?

Not sure if it's supposed to be like that but recent cartridges from other brands that I purchased from speedyweedys were all full.

also it was kinda leaking and hard to hit at first.

Not sure what to do , still have my receipt.</Review>

From ordering to the long wait time, everytime for delivery this place is not convenient. Furthermore, their flower weed is consistently dried out to a crisp. It's never fresh, or moist. Flower potentency is so so..
Much needed improvement at Speedy weedy never seems to materialize. Wont be ordering much from them.< /text>

to those people whining about the i.d. and/or phone verification for new customers... wouldn't it seem like a good idea to know who you're dealing with/going to when carrying marijuana and money on the way to a random? if you can't grasp that concept, your business, and nonsense, is probably something they wouldn't care about losing. derp.<//text><UserId.>102358456787350347103</UserId.><resp>None< /resp>< username>

I’ve been ordering from here for close to a year now. Overall, it’s decent. Delivery times are minimum 1.5 hour wait so you should plan accordingly. There’s been times where I schedule a delivery for a specific time and they either come a bit earlier or an hour later so scheduling seems pretty useless. Scarily, I’m pretty sure some of their carts have been cut... the packaging always looks legit but some of the cartridges I’ve had in the past look like they’ve been tampered with... the oil won’t look as clear as I’m used to with that brand, the oil will start leaking from the bottom, the mouthpiece part will slide off easily, etc.... so they do offer great prices but buyer beware... it’s not often I come across these but when I do, I feel ripped off because I just paid $60 for a $20 cart... and that’s what drove me to write this review, I’ve had a couple so far that have given me AND my friend a funny feeling</Text>

<Review>I placed an order online went through everything. Didn’t understand why they wanted to see my DL#.
Once I explained to them I didn’t feel comfortable based on identity theft, I stop getting messages from them. Then when I called the lady explained why they needed my DL#. So I sent it, then she goes to tell me that it’s a 1-2 hour wait. I explained that I got an email stating 45-1hr. She tells me it’s a 1-2 hour wait after I’ve been wait. For 45 minutes. She then tells me, she is refusing my order!.. DONT ORDER FROM THEM VERY UNPROFESSIONAL .. WISH I COULD GIVE A HALF STAR< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Have been using them for a while now and never have or had any issues. The delivery can take up to 3 hours at MAX, but thats only if you order at 6 o clock on a Friday night. Typically it's pretty quick and even it does take a lil extra time it always comes through and you don't even have to leave the house so be grateful and order in advance. The %2 cash back is legit I've gotten up to 50 dollars of credit from all my orders. Only a few shops do that they usually have the brands I'm looking for at a cheaper price then inshop +tax which is why I keep coming back.

Gina was my delivery driver she was on time and very nice, great customer service. She had great communication gave me a ETA of her arrival time very sufficient. She gave me candy 🍭 I tipped her graciously... Usually I don't tip but she was great!!! I hope I get her when I order again. It's nice to have such a cool down to earth person with great personality serve me. Thank you speedy weedy delivery untill next time.

<Review>I just got my order from you and I was kind of disappointed the young man delivering my order made me walk out of my complex to the street (none of my other delivery drivers had an issue locating my place) I had to find him on the street because all he said is he was parked behind a truck (do you know how many “trucks” are on the street -.-) and he wasn’t wearing a mask when I came up to the car. Usually I don’t get annoyed from ya’ll but this frustrated me. I hope this a one time issue< /Review>< pics>

<text>DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!

They added me to a “block list” that is visible to all dispensaries bc I gave them an HONEST bad review about my experience!!!! They’ll do it to you too!

I placed an order with them 2 weeks ago bc my regular dispensary was unavailable. I found them on WM and they had the following FTP deals listed: “First Time Patients Receive Our 1g Preroll for $.01

First Time Patients Who Spend $100 Will Receive Our 1g Preroll, Grinder, Lighter & Blunt Wrap for $.01”

I placed an order for $144 which included the extra $.01 for the FTP deals and when my order arrived, I received a single mystery airhead that was non-medicated. No grinder, prerolls, lighter or blunt wrap. I immediately texted Shawn, the person who texted me about my order after it was placed and told him they were missing. He texted me “Im so sorry to hear that! May i see a picture of the contents of the bag? I will mark your account to receive 2 pre rolls and extra goodies and the starter kit as well next time you place an order!🙏🙏”

I sent a photo, and after not receiving a response sent a second photo of the empty bag. He then replied:

“No worries we believe you Megan!🙏 i will notate it on your account to rwceive 2 free pre rolls and the starter kit as well for your next order!🙏”

On Jan 14th I placed a second order with them of $135 and put a note on the order “Missing FTP items on first order” just in case they had forgotten. I received that order, and there were - TWO non-medicated airheads! Woo-hoo! No advertised FTP items were included on my second order, even though Shawn had assured me twice that there would be.

Fast forward to today when I went to place an order with my regular dispensary and they told me - I WAS ON A BLOCK LIST FOR WRITING A BAD REVIEW! I told the operator that I had written a bad review for another company, Speedy Weedy, but that I was calling my regular dispensary. They put me on hold. A supervisor answered who told me that Speedy Weedy had put me on a block list that is visible to any dispensary I order from. That if I try to order anywhere, I could be denied bc of this and that it is usually reserved for serious offenses like robbing a driver or using counterfeit money.

The note on the account that Speedy Weedy wrote said they had “begged me to remove my bad review and let them make it right with the FTP items” but they NEVER contacted me and never tried to make anything right!!

After I found out I was on the block list, I texted Speedy Weedy and confronted them and they told me I should have had “common sense” that “FTP items are as supplies last” and that “all of their patients know that” - well I don’t know how a first time patient is supposed to know the FTP items are “as supplies last” when that is not written anywhere, and if that were the case then why didn’t Shawn tell me that when I texted him? Instead he told me TWICE that I would receive the starter kit and two free prerolls on my next order.

AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS! They are shady as heck and will not honor their deals! If you leave them a bad review they will try to block you from being able to order your medications!

Disgusting business practices! Bullies! I will not remove my honest review bc you try to extort a positive one using bully tactics!!!<//text>< Pics>

Edit: please note there are 2 identical websites out there. One does not work at all. The other one works completely.</Review>

Life Savers!

I started giving my business to this place with the start of the new year, and lemme say, I am SO thankful I did. The customer service is kind and efficient, the driver's are thorough and communicate updates, and the product is potent and exactly what I needed medicinally. I love this place and plan to continue as a loyal customer 💛

The wonderful Bee assisted me today (and likely the last few days), they were very friendly to me and patiently updated me on when I could place my next order. Thank you so much! 😊<//Review>

<Review>BEWARES. OverPriced and TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service. These guys are an absolute joke of a business. They tell you it’ll be 1or 2 hours but realistically it’s 3 hours.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!

Excellent service!
5.0
The process of ordering online was so easy. I received a call soon after confirming my order. One item was out of stock, so the girl I spoke with (Sierra i believe) recommended something comparable. She was very friendly. Dallas delivered, and he was excellent. He called when he was on the way, and gave me an ETA. When he was a few minutes away, he sent me another text, which I appreciate! Will definitely order again!<//Text>

Wrong total and wrong products.  Kelly from Speedy Weedy North was incredibly rude.  Would not recommend!  I’ll never order again!  They are not discreet and are disrespectful to veterans.  What a bad experience.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been using Speedy Weedy’s delivery service on a weekly basis for at least 4 months now. Although slower than most other delivery services, I was persistent on using Speedy Weedy’s service in place of others due to their reliability in terms of providing not only quality, but authentic products. However, as of recent I have found myself waiting at the minimum 2 hours for all of my orders and up to 3 hours for some. At this point, it has become such an inconvenience to order from Speedy Weedy that the trustworthiness they offer is not even worth while. No other delivery service I have used has ever taken 3 hours to arrive.<//Review>

{'time': 1599878162647, 'text': 'Hi Kentaro, im truly sorry about the longer then usual wait time, due to the pandemic, delivery services have taken on a huge number of orders while being short staffed and taking extra precautions to being clean and producing safe products and packaging. We will be opening a second location with a storefront in the next few weeks and that will definitely reduce wait times and you will have more options. Love to have you back 🤗'}<//resp>

<Review>Very disappointed the way I was treated. I have been purchasing from this place since May and have completed 49 orders through them. Not anymore! I have been waiting for my new drivers license since the end of July and still have not received it. I have no control over the DMV. But did show proof on other occasions that it has been renewed online. Was told I have a one time pass to receive todays order. I'm almost 50 years old and  was treated like I was under age. I Tipped their drivers $5.00 every time they have delivered even though it always took 2 hrs to get here. All's I have to say now is good luck cause I will take my business else where.</Review>< Pictures>

This review is for their OC location....Worst experience ever. Received old moldy flowers. Called to get a refund or exchange the next day and they told me they could only give a percentage off next delivery but can't even receive that because I am now banned for a reason they could not share. So basically they dump old moldy flowers on their customers and then ban them from ordering again or recovering any loss from the order. KARMA WILL KILL YOUR BUSINESS</Text>

<review>Products are great.being able to use a card is awesome. Downside, they always take forever to deliver.  Usually over 2 hours. I tried ordering ahead of time for a delivery 4 hours later. So far they are 30 minutes late, with no ETA available from the driver.</review>< Pictures>

Never had a problem with them texting me back on the phone I send order with. Over 2 hrs 45 mins in I have to call them to find out they've forgotten my order...... Update* talked to a representative who let me know they were out of the weed I had requested and no record of the person we talked to on the phone before placing order..... Worst service. 5 hrs later they fix by "exchanging"< /Review>

< Review>
Read all the great reviews and decided to give Speedy Weedy a call when I was visiting on vacation. I received a text and call confirming my order. Shortly before my order was supposed to arrive they asked for a copy of my passport even though I had already provided a copy of my ID. When I asked for the criteria for a second ID I received no response. A complete waste of time. Weden was much better</Review>

I placed an order around 9 pm tonight and it didn’t arrive until well after midnight. At almost eleven, the driver texted that it would be a few minutes because he had other deliveries. After almost an hour, I asked him for an updated ETA. He said 20 mins. I waited outside, in the cold, until I got another message that it’d be another 5 mins. 10 mins later, he pulled up. Normally, deliveries take 2 hours tops from other services like this one so it was disappointing to say the least. Not sure if I just had a unlucky driver or if everyone else decided to buy their weed late night on a Thursday but ok. Otherwise, still had an easy enough time ordering, and they didn’t mess the order up. Just upset with the punctuality.</text>< UserId.>

This place literally gets a 5 star!!! I had Called and spoke with lolyn and she helped me get my order in and bc I was A first time paying customer, I spent Over 100$ and got the starter kit and it came with a free pre roll.  I got My order within about an hour. I checked my order and didnt See the free gram bc they were out of pre-rolls. I spoke With lolyn again and she immediately sent me a text so next time I will Get what I was Supposed to get! I ordered At about 10:30 and had it a little before 11:30! Will use this service again!</Review>

<Review>All I have to say is I waited 3.5 hours for my delivery, which I still never received & I LIVE LESS THAN A MILE FROM THE DISPENSARY. I suffer from really bad nausia and can't always just go to a dispensary front myself, and they waisted so much of my time I couldn't even order elsewhere. They kept saying 30 minutes, be there in 15, oh just 12 more minutes, where getting to you next. Just rediculous. I've literally never left a review in my life, but they caused me a lot of grief and never made an effort to make things right with me. Very unprofessional and unprepared. I'd be more than happy to change my review if they simply gave me one good reason to do it. But here I am, continuously disappointed.<//Review>< Pics>

To address the 1-star review; the customer service is fantastic. The portions are quite large. They fill the box quite tightly, but always put in large portions of the entrees. They do pat down the food, so more can fit. Even a VERY hungry eater would be more than satisfied. This is my favorite chinese spot in the area<//Text>

<Text>Taste is on point and the quality is great for a fast food Chinese spot. Lady was generous with the portions and friendly. Will be coming back for sure!  Prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. 10x better than Panda.

Don't leave without trying the spicy orange chicken.< /Text>< time>

Great food, Fantastic customer service! I love coming here after a long day, simply because of how nice the head cashier and server is. And it's good comfort food if you like Chinese . Large portions at good prices as well.</text>

< review>
This is under new ownership, i looked in the kitchen, its really clean. So i decided to try, my favorite is orange chicken, chow main, white rice. Tastes fresh, so i check it out once a week. Come hungry, the foam is packed. They now offer delivery, I believe this location has the best price around. I cruise by late, they are always open when i stop by around 10pm<//review>

<Text>The best Chinese food in La Mirada and the surrounding area. Great customer service and the restaurant is super clean. The food is fresh, and there always cooking in the back. Just wish they still did deliveries!! l would chose them for dinner even more often, if l didn't have to go get it, because l'm super lazy!! Newcomers...please note that the review which was negative, was a different owner and under the name WokStar.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Try the food.  Very bad.  The fried rice old and hard.  The chicken was old and sour.. might get food poisoning.  After along day running around town had to feed my family.   Called and told wokstar.  They did not seem to care about good service.  I think the food was expired.< /text>

<Text>After years of driving past I finally tried this place. It is prominently located on the end of a strip mall and see it every time I drive by.

So we go in and it is very spacious and well lit, there are no customers to be found. One lady, possibly the owner behind the counter. Selections were limited very basic Chinese food and didn't look the freshest. But I was in the mood for some Chinese so we tried it anyway.

The food was acceptable at best. We have been to other HKE locations and the food was much worse quality and quantity than the others.

I normally would give it a 3 star rating, but about 2 weeks after this visit I wanted Chinese again, and rather than driving to Cypress for our favourite HKE experience at 8:30 in the evening we just went up the street to the local La Mirada HKE. When we got there we were shocked, they were closed, the hours sign on the door said they should be open til 9, but the were closed... not just closed, but gone closed, everything cleaned up, lights off, doors locked, nobody home closed. Closed and gone at 8:35ish when they are supposed to be open til 9.

Sorry LM HKE... we will not be back. We drove to the Cypress HKE, got there a little after 9 and they were still open (also list 9 as closing time) selling off the remaining food. Which to me makes sense, why throw everything away when there are people who will buy it? Besides how hard it is to "stay open" while you are cleaning the kitchen and sell off the remaining food.<//Text><username>Brian Bergström<//username><time>1338737259484</time>< user_id>

Best shop you can go to in the area. Honest prices. A mechanic you can trust for a change. Alvaro is very accommodating and finished the job quickly. He noticed a hole in my exhaust and welded it with no extra charge. That should tell you everything.< /Text>

I paid 1213.33 after three days the engine signal came on again, I took it and they took it away, after 9 days my truck left me on the road, I had to call the tow truck, I talk to the mechanic and he tells me that it is another fault that he did not repair and the 1213 dollars we threw away, I could not stand the repair they made for three weeks, that he can review it but I have to pay again to repair it.  Everyone tells me what they charged is crazy, a total robbery.< /text>

First of all I want to thank Alvaro & the other mechanics for taking such great care of my SUV. I took my car to Hyundai to have it serviced and they gave me a list of things I needed to do but were charging two arms & a leg!
My brother in-law is the 1 who told me about Alvaro & the business.
Alvaro & his crew did a great job. I actually had them fix more on my car but it wasn’t listed.
Their prices were 2 times less than what the dealership charged so instead of giving them my hard earned $ I took it to M & A auto and saved a lot of $!. They followed the Covid protocols, they covered my steering wheel with this plastic wrap among with other things to keep me safe.
It seems like they treat every customer (who’s nice) like family.
My car feels like it’s brand new! Thanks again crew.</text>

Whatever I go in for is always fixed appropriately so I don't have to return like I have many times in the past at other places where I feel as a woman I'm taken advantage of.  He is honest and affordable.  Thank you Alvaro!!!  This last visit I was so appreciative of how you and your team went out of your way for me!!!! I would recommend this auto shop to everyone!< /review></record>

There were numerous things wrong and we addressed the issues as they arose. Before any repair work is done we communicate with our customers and inform them of price. The reason we do this is so there is no missunderstanding. Lastly just like a physician we go through a list solutions based on the issue.

<Review>Took my car here for “inspection” my car was overheating and loss of power and wouldn’t turn on from time to time. I only came to this place because a friend of mine recommended me to it plus it had good reviews. Gave him three days with my car three days. Alvaro told me it needed a fan module and a new thermostat and that’s why it was overheating I told him that’s fine as long it gets fixed. Then he mentioned my loss of power was due to spark plugs and it needs new ones and said my serpetine belt is cracked and my air filters were dirty. I told him to replace it all just wanted my car to be back to normal gave him my trust he charged me over $911 just for all that and on the same day I got it back my car was over heating! It was worse! I took my back to him and I told him what happen you didn’t check and he said it didn’t overheat with him and I asked him it overheats when I put the AC and he says “oh I didn’t have the AC on when I drove it” like how are you going to not turn on the AC when you know my car is overheating ??? What kind of mechanic is that? Then I left it there again and 3 hours later he tells me now that it’s the radiator and everything will cost around another $900. And I’m like this is bs you had all this time to inspect and now you’re telling me it’s something else? What’s next it’s the water pump? Just so unprofessional he proceeded to say he will give me $100 off which is STILL a lot. My friend felt so bad to recommend me this spot, never coming here again. Also my car still having trouble turning on and is still OVERHEATING so idk what exactly they “fixed” or changed.</Review>< user_name>

This is my go-to place for my car needs. I've been going here since my college years and I keep coming back for the exceptional service and care M & A Auto Care provides! I won't go anywhere else and I refuse to go to another mechanic. After I graduated college, I moved out towards Los Angeles and I make the drive every time when my car needs something because it's hard to find an honest mechanic and team you can trust with your car.

They run a awesome team here and they will always recommend the best for your safety and your car (and it's the honest truth too!) The owner, Al, always looks out for my car and follows up on the finished product. I get my oil changes here and also I've had my brakes changed and air filter changed. Being someone  is who doesn't know a lot about cars and relies on my dad or brother to tell me the needs of my car, I know I can always ask Al and his team here for their recommendations. It is always a wonderful time here and I look forward to every visit!

I recommend all of my friends to come here and I would recommend anyone as well! I give my honest support to this business and I wish it the BEST to keep growing and flourishing to be even better!<//text>

Needed replacement of my catalytic converter system (ugh), but Hector did a great job.  Everybody is pretty cool here, the owner Alvaro and Carlos, who gave me several rides to and from the shop.  In fact, they even were willing to drive me home to Mt. Baldy!!!  I've been looking for a new shop as I tired on the cost for repairs at my dealer.  I plan on using M&A again when I need the next work done.< /Text>

First of all they're conveniently located.  They run a full service auto repair facility.  They actually emailed me a photo of repairs needed and cost of repair.  The work was done in a timely manner and the cost was more than fair.  My only complaint was parking.  Because they're so good they are usually crowded but still manage to get the work done in a timely fashion.< /Review>

Been using M&A Auto Care for my mechanic needs for a numbers of years.  The owner has always been a straight shooter and always recommends exactly what's needed and never tries to sell you any extra services that you really don't need.  I have never had to return back once something is fixed.  I would certainly recommend his services to anyone who needs a trustworthy mechanic who provides mechanic services at very reasonable prices.<//review>

Very friendly. Very reasonable oil change pricing. Especially being on a fixed income.
I even got a personal text message thanking me for my business.
I highly recommend M & A.</Review>

I like the ambience and the honesty of the staff.they could not do my tire rotation because I didn't have the tire lock so they refer me to the next door service to work on my car need.</text>

<Review>I have used their services twice now In the last few years. They are prompt, reasonable, honest and they do excellent repair work.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for quality repairs at a fair, reasonable price.  Also, the owner Alvaro is very nice to work with.</Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<Text>I love these guys! I went in for a car filter and oil change and they gave me a lower price than expect and told me I didn't need to change my til a because it still looked new, even though they could have changed it and charged me anyways, I also came in for window repair, I barely sat down and they were done!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Simply the best service that I have ever experienced, great work on all of my vehicles van, truck and BMW. They are very honest about repairs unlike a lot of other shops. I have been a customer for a few years and will always be.

(Translated by Google) The service in this shop is very good. My car can't catch fire anymore. The boss asked the staff to go to the garage to help me light the car on fire, and then help me repair it. Very good. I will repair the car in this shop in the future.

This is my main gym of choice because of the location to work. It is clean, but equipment breaks from time to time, which seems to be the case for 24 hour fitness. It is a normal gym with decent classes, tons of cardio machines, and a decent weight selection. The machine choices are abundant.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this gym based on their equipment and free weight availability.</text>

<Review>Probably one of the better 24 hour fitness gyms. The location is pretty good and it has a good space. Doesn't get too packed which is nice. It's pretty well ventilated, so it's not as stuffy as the other 24 hour fitness gyms. I'd recommend checking it out.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I have used this gym several times whenever I traveled to San Francisco. It's a little smaller than my home gym but less crowded than other 24 Hour locations in downtown San Francisco. It has an interesting layout where treadmills are placed on the first floor facing large Windows on the street level, which makes you less bored during your exercise.

Staff are friendly and helpful in fixing my check-in problem.<//Review>

Location is great, price is reasonable, friendly staff, great selection of machines.
The cons: can get super busy and you have to wait for the machines or lockers.
Bathrooms can be a bit dirty.
Towels (if you use towel service) often have stains on them.
There is no sauna, pool or steam room at thys gym. You see those a lot back in Europe.< /text>

Alright, all my complaining about having to bring my driver's license along with my membership card is done...24 Hour Fitness now has fingerprint scanner entry!!! Not even a membership card required now. This is awesome!

While this is a 5-star upgrade which delights me to no end, I'm subtracting 2 stars for this location only because it's tiny and crowded...I usually avoid it.</review>

< review>
I gave this three stars because it's a pretty good facility for the city, but as far as 24 hour fitnesses go, it's below average.

First, it should really be called 18 hour fitness. I signed up for this gym with the expectation that it could accommodate my weird hours, but when I showed up to work out the first time they were closed! Keep the weekend hours in mind when signing up. (They are open 24 hours Monday through Thursday.)

The top floor has a bunch of brand new weight machines, and a variety of relatively new cable machines. The free weights are all old, but they work just the same as they always do. A lot of the cardio equipment needs a refresh. The treadmill I used kept switching speeds on me which was very frustrating. When I went to change the speed back to how I had it set, the buttons were unresponsive and I had to hop off.

The staff is super friendly, and I don't often have to wait to use equipment, especially on the weekends. If you go lunch time during the week or any time between 5pm and 8pm, good luck getting on any of the cardio equipment.

One last note: I'm hesitant to use the lockers here because I've heard of three occasions in which people's locks have been cut and their stuff stolen.<//review>

<Review>Get in and out. This place is small, and there's a ton of people that frequent this gym, especially rush-hour after work.

The cardio machines downstairs seem like they're all on their last leg, and are incredibly loud when running on the treadmills or moving on the elipticals.

The free weights are pretty standard, but the weight machines are crying to be updated.

The locker-room is gross, but that's what you get for joining 24HF. I don't shower in them, and try to run in and out as fast as possible.

Overall, the gym gets the job done, just gross.< /Review>< rating>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I go weekdays around 11a-2p (somewhere in there). Never been too busy then, I always get in my bench, squats, deadlifts etc with little wait. I went at 5pm once and it was a nightmare, don't even bother (maybe that's just me).

Very clean in the locker rooms and on the equipment. Equipment rarely broken and is fixed within 2 days if it does break. Nice and sunny on the 2nd floor with a lot to look at while resting between sets. Can be a bit warm on the 2nd floor (weight area) sometimes. Reasonable amount of lockers, showers, etc. Can't speak to cardio equipment, I never use it.

2x bench press, 1 power cage w/ pullup bar, 1 squat rack,  2x incline benches, 1x decline bench, plenty of misc inclinable seats near the dumbells as well as benches without racks. Use metal plates that can be annoying to pick up. Plenty of miscellaneous machines, including a smith machine if you hate your back. Extra barbells laying around for deadlifts, etc.

This is my favorite 24hr fitness in the area, unless you need a pool, on account of the fact that it doesn't have a pool.

I've been here >6 months now.  Friendly staff.<//Text>< pictures>

Clean. Great selection of weight machines. Good cardio. Nice locker room. Difficult to find an outlet, though there were a couple cardio machines that had one nearby - I believe a recumbent bike had an accessible outlet (ago I can watch Netflix, on a long cardio session)..  Don't remember if it has Wi-Fi - it Should, being a Super Sport, but not positive. Had towel service. Dunno what the parking situation is, though I don't think there is street parking nearby. I take rideshare. There might be a garage ?</Review>

<Review>Hands down worst . Being from Southern California and I didn't realize any 24 hour fitnesses got this bag,  I guess we're spoiled in HB. I think being in the Bay Area this should be a high quality 24, NO WAY. If you're going to bring a guest for a day 3 day or 7 day pass make sure to bring them to a super sport that has all the amenities are looking for as well be specific to that club.<//Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It's great to have a fitness gym wherever you go ... This one near Embarcadero was very handy when I was walking around the city center.

Staff is very professional and courteous. Tried the chicken kabob sandwich and it was fantastic!  Excellent marinade that is fully immersed in the chicken. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other options. Definitely recommend. Thanks pita spot!</Review>

<review>I really wanted to like this place! The guy was really nice and patient while I figured out what I wanted. I ordered a gyro, kebbeh and an order of fries. I'll start with the gyro, it was a salad in pita bread... I had to actually move everything out of the way to even find the meat. I couldn't figure out how to eat it to get meat in every bite. The kebbeh... the meat was not tight when you bit into it, it all fell out and it just tastes like ground beef with Lipton Onion Soup mix, honestly. The fries... I don't even know what to say about the fries they were hard, tough and greasy so I only ate one and then threw them away. Now the hummus was on point I enjoyed it very much! I took the meat out of the kebbeh and put it in my gyro, I was also given their cucumber sauce which was yogurt based....only that's all I tasted was plain yogurt. Sorry, I really did want to like it.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7izIfVvujH0BrxaUyC6m5krJd-04Ru_kZO_q_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwM2utufNWdulex06qXcdC1iRloZfXhDHA_5ve=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Excellent food. Better service. I cannot recommend this food enough! The beef shawarma is the best I've ever had. The restaurant is small, so if that bothers you, make sure to takeout or have it delivered.< /review><date>1571990954077<//date><Name>Michael Joanitis<//Name>< resp>

Food is always consistently excellent.  Lamb and beef are from grass- fed animals.  Their hummus is amazing.  Each order is made from scratch.  Chicken kabob is great!<//text>

Stay far far away from this place! I stopped by to order lunch to go and the prices for the offered portions and quality was absolutely ridiculous! Here's a little example and you be the judge. One 12oz can of Coke cost $5. Now imagine what an entree cost! Would give a negative rating if I could!< /Review>

I wanted to like this place, but couldn't. The kabob was tough and dry, and the girl behind the counter was absolutely NOT wanting to be there for any reason. She messed up my order and would sit out front watching TV while I had to reach past her to get my drink. The 2 stars are only for the dessert.<//review>

The food and service are unlike any other restaurant!  I just ordered several different things and everything was delicious.  The owner was awesome as well.  Also, make sure to try their pomegranate juice!  I absolutely love this place!!!</Text>

Yes! I happened upon this Mediterranean restaurant because they were one of the few places open for dinner in thanksgiving!

The staff was friendly. The food was fresh, hit and authentic.

I ordered the lamb plate (with rice, salad, pita and hummus). Nice serving size, fair price and seasoned well. would definitely revisit

Pita spot is the best in town.
Desert are delicious<//review>

Delicious food! Ordered the chicken kafta plate, the gyro plate, and a beef sandwich. Everything was perfectly seasoned and tender. The hummus with the pomegranate seeds is different and delicious! Must also try the homemade desserts! Will definitely come back<//Text>

Love the Baba ghanouj!! Hummus is good too. My kids loved the shawarma sandwiches. The server is a bit young and seemed like she didn't have much experience. But It's a small hole in the wall and the owner is great and very personable.  Overall, a good experience.< /review>

We got there 45 minutes before they close (which it's super early) and the only thing we could get was take out food because they wanted to close. Not going back there ever.</text>

<Review>Cool spot to get Mediterranean food in the area. The place is clean and we were served pretty quick after placing the order. I got the falafel and Gyro and my friend got the chicken shawarma. I thought it had a lot of garlic personally (the shawarma) but he said he usually has it with more. Regardless it was good< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
We just had dinner my and my husband and the food couldn't be better. We ordered the tri-tip need sandwich and the chicken shawarma.  The food was delicious. I would advise to get pomegrande juice, freshly squeezed, no healthier 😉😉👍👍👍👍👍. Thanks for the great service.</Review>

زرتهم الويكند الماضي.. لذيذ للغاية، ماشاءالله تبارك الله ابداع .. كان الطلب: فطاير الجبن وشاورما وأوصال دجاج وكانت جدًا جدًا جدًا لذيذة، الطعم بشكل عام طازج والخدمة ممتازة واستقبالهم كان جميل 👍🏻

This place used to be very good before Covid 19. Now it sucks being 1) way over priced; 2) the noodle bowl almost got nothing but rice noodles. They charged $13 per bowl and it size is tiny. I ordered a beef stew rice noodle bowl. It only comes with 4 tiny beef stew cubes and some rice noodles, that's it. For the price I can have a pho from Loi and doesn't cost me as much.<//review>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Good place, not overcrowded, and relatively cheap prices. Only thing that is not convenient is that this place accepts cash-only. I know this has nothing to do with food quality which is great, but the fact that all nearby restaurants accept cards kinda makes it as point that you need to consider. Anyway, go to the ATM, get a $20 bill and come try some great noodle!< /review></record>

<Review>Great quick spot for noodles. You can build your own bowl and choose the ingredients and broth. Flavor is authentic and not too salty, service is quick and prices are very reasonable. My go-to spot for great comfort food.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This place serves great noodles! I usually come here with my friends, they offer a few dishes and you can chose your spice level. The prices are moderate and this place is great for just casual eating.</text>

I love this food!! The homemade noodles and dumplings are the clear go-to items, but everything I've eaten here has been great. My 6 year old son says it's his favorite restaurant. There's often quite a wait - we try to go early (5-ish) to beat the lines. HD Chinese Yunnan Rice Noodle</Text>

<review>A wide variety of topping and soup bases for the noodles. I tried the original soup base, with beef and shittake mushrooms, very good. Might go back to try the spicy soup base.<//review><username>Angie Lim-Chan< /username>< Gmap_id>

Delicious chinese restaraunt on Noriega street that focuses on soups. All soups come with tofu skin, cabbage and some other veggies. Additions include a plethora of mushrooms and thinnly sliced beef and some other things that I cannot recall. Cash only.<//review>

<review>Fast, knowledgeable, professional, great customer service. Had both the tire and rim we needed.. Saved us last minute just before closing and didn't even blink that they had to stay a little later then closing time. Will definitely return.</review>< userid>

<Review>Went here on 03/24/2021 and asked for used tires. The guy gave me an amount. I agreed and ended up with 2 good back tires on my car.
Respectful people. They treated me like Family. Will be coming back soon for tires.
Five stars.
RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. MOST LIKELY EVERYONE! Thank you!< /Review>< pics>

Excellent service, attention to detail. Blew out on the 41, worried we would be SOL since it was Saturday evening. These dudes go above and beyond. Cutest guard dog.< /Review>

<Text>This placed saved our behind. They are open late when other tire shops close up. They are friendly and aim to make sure you get the best deal for your money. It has a small parking area, but they make it work. They are cash only, but there is a mini mart across the street with an ATM.< /Text>< pictures>

Had two tires swapped out , turns out one of the used tires wasn't good. These guys took care of everything with no questions asked and no extra charge. In the pouring rain too! Very cool</review>

I came here with my friends and they literally took advantage of us bc we were girls that obviously didn’t know abt cars and just wanted new tires then they gave me old tires that were all different sizes and when I came back and told them they gave me attitude and put words into my mouth saying I asked for used tires when I actually asked them for new ones .Bad experience never coming again and don’t recommend you coming unless you have a man with you lol .<//review>

<Review>This place is fabulous for the price. The staff is wonderful. I came from out of town expecting to stay up in Sacramento. Unfortunately things changed. But I highly recommend this place to anybody who's looking for a manicure pedicure. Gel or feel. It's worth the money. Enjoy<//Review>< user>

<review>This is my permanent place to go get my eyebrows waxed by the one and only Tina.  She is absolutely the sweeties and gentle woman whom i recommend to all who needs their eyebrows done.  I promise you that you will love the way she takes care of her customers and will always go back without a doubt!</review><rating>5<//rating><Time>1581495126122< /Time></record></dataset><record>

I have never gotten a pedicure before, but the service was excellent. My specialist was polite and professional. I spent most of my time chatting with my friend. They have massaging chairs and were very thorough in taking care of my feet and legs. I plan to return on a monthly basis!<//Text>

I’ve been going to Kevin for 11 years. His artistry and confidence in delivery of every new nail art I bring to him , which he does to perfection, is satisfying to  know when I walk out of the salon my nails are amazing and stay that way. No chipping, breaking or lifting. I’m always getting compliments since it’s not the average looking manicure but he gives it that special something that makes a difference. Kevin, his wife Tina and the staff are a pleasure to be around. I highly recommend them.<//review>

Ive been going here for a while and they are a great family run business. They do great work and always go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. Whenever I get a full set my nails do not break like with some other places. Plus they do good designs!< /text>

The ambiance is peaceful and relaxing. They are meticulous and skilled, and they take the time to make sure you are comfortable during your experience and pleased with the work they have done.  If you are looking for a rushed nail job, look elsewhere – you will get what you ask for.  If you are looking for talented nail artist who take their time and go out of their way for you – and still offer competitive prices – this is the place for you.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The prices are decent, but you get what you pay for. The gel polish looked thin/watery when she was putting it on, & it only lasted about a week before they began to chip. He also made me bleed. I used to come here, years ago. But, the quality has changed.<//review>

<Review>Im a kinda germ afob , this place could use a really good clean & wipe down of all the surfaces & little fans, but they did use clean utensils in little packets. But, she was sharing other tools with another lady.
They had music & TV on which was a little annoying
I found 2 other places that do fantastic flowers on my nails, but they are not close by.

I wanted to try a local place, she did a good job but, she did cut my cuticle & her flowers are just simple 6 dots. Unless, they cleaned the place & I got a person with experienced nail designs, I wouldn't return.
The 3 stars is for the clean nail packets.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Review>This nail salon may be in a hard to spot location. But its worth the drive if you dont live close. They do an excellent job and are always very nice, friendly,  and gentle! Everyone else that comes in while im here seems like regulars who keep coming back. I have been 2 times now but finally feel like I found a salon worth coming back to!< /Review></record>

< review>
My whole family comes here for their hair, nails, and waxing service.  The price is unbeatable for the quality and the service they provide. Everyone is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make sure that you are happy before you leave.  Phuo is the name of the hair stylist there (I think) is very funny. She can engage you in a conversation the whole time that you there and the end result is still perfect. As other reviewers here, I totally agree that this is one of the best salon in Sac. I also love how nice and clean this place is. As long as they're around, my family and I won't be going anywhere else for our beautique.
Note: It's a decent size salon but not huge and they only have 3-4 staff members there so it can get quite busy. As I've notice, appointment is always recommended to be sure that you can get in without having to wait long. They're also very good with keeping their customer's appointment and not taking a walk-in prior to your appointment unlike most other salon's experiences I've encountered.</review>

Tiffany is the best.  Don't go in unless you have an appointment with her . I got them done and they were the best I've  ever had and I've had my nails done for 10 yrs.  Just on Monday I didn't call and when I went in the lady told me tiffany wasn't there but  "she do good job for you"  and my nails are the furthest from a good job . The lady that did them was an older lady. I should have know that it was a bad ideal when she couldn't open one eye!  4 of my nails have broken off already! it's been two days.   they are so uneven and sharp!  I paid 30$ for something I could have done myself!  Just remember go to tiffany if you do go!  She is hard to catch as a walk in so call and make an appointment!</text>

Just don't go. Their waxing is great, and people are friendly, but it took 2 hours to get my acrylic set done. She ripped my nail off and made me bleed, polish was wrinkled and messed up. Floor was covered in old nails, not clean at all.< /Text>

<time>1513054273641<//time><review>One of the worst nail salons I’ve been to. The place is dirty & their tools are dirty. They never clean their tools after they’re done with a client, they just move on to the next client without cleaning their tools & they don’t even replace the towels that they place under your hands. They also lie about the type of product/powder they use. I told the lady who did my nails that I am allergic to one of the powders & she lied about using a different type of powder & I ended up with a bad allergic reaction all over my fingertips.</review><user_name>Mays Mekki</user_name><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809aded3895c72c9:0xa321291a0d2c6708<//gmap_id><Rate>1</Rate><user>108883785163273482261</user>< Pics>

< Review>
I scheduled an appointment for a Mani along with two other friends. As I came for my appointment - I was not on their appointment list, they had no space available, very crowded and loud, more than two hour wait, and they literally asked me to leave because they were too busy already. Very rude and not organized.< /Review>

<date>1540592737948</date><rating>5< /rating><Review>This is a very nice place to have lunch or dinner in the heart of Whittier Area. It is located inside the shopping mall next to Kohl’s, Sear and 24 Fitness and many small businesses near by. Inside and outside this restaurant was very clean and roomy. The servers were also very friendly and helpful. I ordered a big beacon ,cheese , lettuce and tomato for lunch. It was huge and delicious. This burger was so good and juicy and it came with fries . It was so big that I have to cut it down to small portions. I was very happy what I have. Next time I should try something different from the menu. Services here were outstanding and friendly. The prices were decent and affordable.< /Review>< Pictures>

I'm so glad my family & I were able to come back to this place! The food was good & the service that Jose gave was even better. Always made sure we had what we needed, was even really nice about having to help us clean us our spilled water that got everywhere. Even let us know that the car show will be resuming again soon. Wanted to try it out after the pandemic & glad to say we'll be coming here alot more!</text>

Always good burgers. Calamari appetizer was excellent, and loved the American Songbook music playing and the service.  Very nice way to end my Saturday night.<//review>

I really love this place!!  I’ve been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed.
Great food with healthy options!!  Avocado toast is amazing!!!
Flavored creamer for my coffee and my day is off to a grand start.

They also have breakfast specials for under $10.
$6.99 to be exact 😊</Text>

This was me 2 days ago. Tacos, were cold, and seriously, who likes their tacos with artificial lemon juice, I truly believe it was even expired because the taste was horrible. My family didn't have a good experience either, I feel sad for the next costumers, because it's horrible.</text>

We haven't been there since COVID-19.  Red Robin was packed so we came here. Only 2 people working the floor. Very little attention from them. The Coke signs look so faded. The upholstery was torn.</review>

<Review>In a word, underwhelming. My Cobb salad was turning brown as soon as the air hit, it was literally going bad as I ate it. I asked for no cheese and my personal pet peeve: avocado was missing, a big disappointment. For that reason alone I would not return. Also chunks of ice in the shakes, another deal breaker. My big take away, now I no longer have to wonder, nothing special.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>"Let the good times roll" just good old fashioned burgers and fries (amongst other things of course). Good value for your money plus Fri night car shows (seasonal). We happened to go for the "Trunk or Treat" show which was the last for this year. Tons of awesome cars the would make Fonsey say "Ayyyy". Keep your eyes open for next year car show season. But in the mean time take the kids to Ruby's and force them to listen to your stories about the "Good Ol' Days". Be there or be square 🍔 👍🏻<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvuA_qnbnbfbHliu4I7YqO8M3j9a9mRm4GTTML=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt9u3xi8dy_A9CciBET0hdXOFh3aYKh1oq8R1y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVC7ZfScE29K84wVj71ROJ460vOQL6UlyTGllG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDg3pmI-NUDt0YIpWi2QwcWnEGM3k9QTQk7z1D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVU2ou5CG_OeOHSyEWerXvF3c_sCUDIH7nsXvm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8TzILu_shlZK1u4J0KaiejfmSRXx5pNtBIQP5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<review>This place has a lot of old fogeys hanging out here but I like it because it makes me feel old school ! Ain't nothing wrong being old school and what makes it better is that the food is Delicious and the servers are awesome ! Especially this one server he was like the waiter of the month, I think month after month. I forgot his name but he's very good at his job ! I have to go back to get his name and hopefully when I do he will be my server again 🙏🤗< /review>< gmapID>

The food is good, but I think the shakes are the BEST part of this place. When they bring you the shake it always come with a little extra from the cup they make it in. The only reason for 4 stars to me is that I didn't receive "AWESOME SERVICE." I just feel if I have to ask for a refill then it's not considered "AWESOME SERVICE."<//review>

My experience tonight was ok. The food was delicious and the employees there are great. My glass of water had smudges and the waiter said it was because of the water when they wash it. It leaves that residue but when you rub your finger on it why does it rub off? Anyway. My daughter also got a water and as she was drinking from her straw she noticed lip stick on the top of the glass. The waiter was nice enough to get me another Glass but I expect him to offer the soda for free or something. I didn't want to talk to the mgr because I was already getting a free meal my daughter got from school so I didn't want to seem cheap. Anyways great place but they just need to check their dishes a little bit better.</text>

50's dinner. Burger's are great. This time we came in for dessert - my Brownie Sunday was overflowing with hot fudge, a cloud of whipped cream, creamy rich ice cream all topped of with a sweat cherry - mouth watering! Can't eat that much - not to worry they have a Mini Sunday all the deliciousness in a single scoop. Waitresses are friendly and the atmosphere is fun!< /review>

<Text>The service is great but the food is mediocre. It is a nice place to go with kids, and sometimes the specials are surprisingly good. Their standard cheese burger never disappoints but everything else is just kind of bland. Desserts are good though. Get a shake/malt.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Great place to eat, took the family. The waiter was great. When I asked him. What burger did he recommend. He mentioned a spicy burger. It was better that I expected. Makes you feel like if you were back in the 50's. Me and the family had a great experience. I do recommend it to everyone.<//text>

One of the best burgers i've had in a long time.
$15.00 . Wish they had steak fries though.

<review>It's a great place to bring the family to eat and look at all the old cars on Friday nights. The last show for the cars on Friday's is coming up at the end of the month. Only 2 more car show Friday's to go. Oct 18th and 25th. It's a great place to get a bacon cheeseburger with a shake. Or breakfast anytime. 👍 Rubies, and great service.😋😜</review>< Name>

I have enjoyed Ruby's for many years. I have called in orders in the past.
I was trying their online ordering ap only to find it did not have/offer a specific item they advertise onsite, on the same page as the online order option. I didn't find this out until after I had added the several other items to my cart; I cancelled the online order and placed a call.
Still on hold over 10 mins from the time a girl put me on hold I felt I had been ignored/forgotten and tried calling on a 2nd line. It dropped into a recording about calling back and the mailbox was full.  I hung up both lines, and tried again. An Hispanic gentleman answered. I told him I'd been on hold over 10 mins and would he like to take my order. He asked if I wanted to place an order, I replied yes. Without making even an acknowledging the problem, an offer of apology, or any type discount, of he took my order. He restated my order, gave me a total, and say 7  to 10 mins to be ready.
My friend left 5 mins later estimating traffic about 5 mins. After he arrived he waited an additional 10-15 mins to get our food.
Although oddly not hot, really hardly warm, it tasted as I have had in the past.
I am sadly disappointed with this incident and will likely not try ordering from there either online or by phone again. Definately not well handled.< /Review>

when you order a burger with jalapenos and pepper Jack cheese, you expect it to be hot the way I want it, but it had absolutely no flavor or heat caliente. sorry but I wonder if they were bought out cuz they suck now. service was a 5 star but food not so much< /review>

Ruby's is ok, not great. Service was good. Food is good but not a good value.  I got the BLTA , with all of three slices of bacon. Sandwiches come with refillable french fries. You can pay extra to substitute onion rings. However, they don't give you that many rings and no refills. Would not come to Ruby's of my own choice.<//Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Service is extremely slow. We were seated immediately upon arrival. The place was empty. There were only 2 other tables occupied so naturally we thought we would be greeted by a server shortly to take our drink order. There was a waiter named Lupe who saw us and never came to our table to tske our drink order. Didn't even acknowledge us. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came over. Lupe walked by us a couple if times and didn't acknowledge us. We had to get up and ask a hostess to have someone take our order. The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because the waitress who helped us was ver friendly and she apologized for the experience.  Her service was great and food came out promptly.< /Review>< pics>

<name>Makes Sense<//name><review>This restaurant has amazing and courteous staff. When deciding if a place deserves a good review, how the staff coducts themselves, is a major factor for me personally. They get 5 stars. Now as for the setting. It is 1940s themed with an actual sit-down counter. Staff uniform and decor match 40s theme. The only reason overall score is not 5 stars is because of the menu. Although the food was indeed amazing, it lacked options in terms of how things can be cooked. For example Hashbrowns were not an option only potato spuds. 4/5 will indeed return to this great spot.<//review><user>112288835230450317527</user></record></dataset><record>

A fun place and great comfort food. The service can take a bit, every once in a while. There is a manager here that is really friendly and seems like he really loves his job. It's neat to see him talking to everyone.<//text>

Just meh. Service was ok, food not so much. Cold tots w/chili. Small salad, good. Burned to a crisp burgers, very dry and bland. Glad we had gift cards otherwise our $50 tab would've been harder to swallow than the dry burgers.</text>

Decent diner style food with a large menu. Helpful staff and fun atmosphere. Know much of what you order will be very greasy but if you are craving something of that nature, this is the place to go. Not too bad of a wait typically but know that if you show up during  a day when they run their car shows in the parking lot, it can be way too busy and crowded and not worth the wait.< /Text>

We were just here, got seated and waited for nearly 30 minutes with no service provided while people came in after us and got drinks and their food. Needless to say we weren't very happy and left! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE POOR AND LACK OF SERVICE!!!</review>

You can never get in this place when you do it takes forever to get your food and it it's not as good as other restaurants so I don't know why it takes so long service is not good they can improve I wish they would</text>
