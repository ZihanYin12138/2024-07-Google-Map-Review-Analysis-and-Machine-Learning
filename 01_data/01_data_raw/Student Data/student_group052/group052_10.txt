This Place is Overrated. Their food is Very BASIC and lacks food quality taste. I've been to lesser credible Thai Places that Excell above and beyond taste and is far less inexpensive. Some Food Items here are far less superior than to Panda Express (food items comparison)... overall, don't waste your money here.<//Text>

This was my first time going here but I will definitely be going back. When we arrived (party of two) we were greeted by staff with a Hi and a friendly smile and told to take a seat wherever we liked.
It took less then 10 minutes for staff to come to our table and ask if we wanted any drinks, we ordered and she left. When she returned, we ordered our food. This consisted of one dish each and a plate of rice that we would share.
Now this is where they lost a star! It took over 30 minutes to get our food and although it was still warm and very tasty, that was just way to long. Also the staff didn't come to the tables and say, sorry for the wait or offer us a second glass of Soda or Water!
Nevertheless the food was great!😋 So go check them out and don't miss out on a great food find!😊<//text>

<text>Took over 15 minutes for the waitress to came to my table to ask for drinks. Waited for over an hour for my food.  No refills on my drinks even though I asked them twice.  No plates, silverware and napkins. Food got cold really quick when I finally got a plate which it wasn’t even mine. REALLY BAD SERVICE.  Waitress had to retake my order after an hour of waiting.   After 20 minutes of more waiting, they still couldn’t find my ticket.  People who got there after us, got their meal and were eating when we walked out.  Just got tired of waiting and walked out.   AND I still had to pay for my drinks.  What a joke!!!< /text>< time>

Two years later, this restaurant still a fun place to hangout.  Of course, for a few cold ones.  Some said “Good food good wine”, I’ll say, come here with friends and you will get “Good Thai food and a good Thai beers”

Revisited; Consistency of food, service and atmosphere are the most significance to have a profound effect on success.  Thai Cuisine II certainly earned the best Thai restaurant in Merced, hands down.

As close as you can get from not being in Thailand.  Two thumbs up.<//Text>

This place is pretty average.  If you know what to order, the meals will be decent (pad se ew, papaya salad and tom yum).  If you venture out of your nomral order like the Orange Chicken, you'll will be dissapointed.  It is the driest and most bland orange chicken you'll ever encounter.  Panda express is far superior to the ones here.  Another dissapointment are their pho, curries and bbq. It is Merced and you shouldn't expect it to compare to LA or Bay Area.<//text>

The food is always good but the pick up service is not good. Ordered online, showed up at the time I was told to and after waiting 10 minutes I was told it would be another 10-15 minutes. Basically it took 45 minutes to get a pick up order.<//text>

The food quality is mediocre at best. The service is inconsistent: sometime bad, other time very bad. What really turns me off is the owner's attitude towards food safety and sanitation at this restaurant. I would not want to risk my health at this restaurant, despite all those five-star reviews, which I am not so sure about their authenticity.<//review>

I love the price for the amount of food given. Generous portions. Most entrees can be shared, super quick take-out times, and AMAZING THAI ICED COFFEE. Favorite is the Pad Thai combo, medium spicy. Will make a drive out here for their food.< /text>

The food from Thai Cuisine II is the best Thai food I have had in any Thai restaurant outside of Thailand itself! I travelled to Thailand many years ago and this is the only Thai restaurant that has exceeded all expectations; truly comparable to great Thai food I experienced in Thailand. My mother and I immensely enjoyed the pineapple fried rice, and the yellow curry chicken. The portions are very generous.  The staff is very friendly, and professional. My mother and I would highly recommend this restaurant, and are looking forward to enjoying this delicious Thai food again soon.</text>

My boyfriend and I love to come here to get Thai food! His favorite to order is the Thai Cuisine Fried Rice and mine is the orange chicken (basic, I know). The orange chicken is always so tender with some crisp to it, and the fried rice has a really great taste all around. Enough food to split between people, as well. It is also connected to a bar so you can order drinks if you want.< /Review>

Food was amazing as always. The service was exceptional as well. The place was popping, great place for a family dinner to a first date. They have a bar connected right next door. You may order off the menu while having a drink at the bar. We had ordered the beef pho noodle which comes with a side of bean sprouts and lime as well. We also ordered beef and broccoli and chow mein. Can't wait for out next visit. Thank you ladies and all the cooks.<//review>

Family owned so I had very high expectations and they delivered beyond them.  I had a large take out order for 15, so many different menu and appetizer orders.   To just cut to the chase the food was excellent,  their green beans fab, curry dishes great, Pad Thai fantastic.  So cut to the point- who would have guessed the best Thai I've ever had was in Merced!<//text>

Been coming for a few years, good vibes, food, and crew. Plant based friendly and they substitute things to meet your specific needs. Just a good spot</review>

<text>Really bad service, they don't go up to you at all after they give you your food for refill nor check. They need better waitress. Orange chicken was too sweet. The fried rice and chow mein was good.< /text><Name>jonathan V<//Name><Time>1566613169101< /Time>< Gmap_id>

It is very popular and by extension very busy. Expect to wait sometime before you are seated as this place gets pretty crowded at times. I've gone in for just an order of pad thai without calling ahead, (rookie mistake), and waited upwards of 20 minutes after ordering. I also ordered a thai ice tea, which was about the size of a typical small drink, for $5. It is a bit pricey so if you are looking for a place that is cheap or you just want to get a quick bite this is probably not the place to go. But I must say that the ambience inside is very pleasant. So if you're looking for a nice night out with friends and don't mind paying a little extra this is the place to go. The food was exceptional and I highly recommend you try it at least once.</review>

It's a nice and tiny place for a small town. We always stop by here if we're in town and we're craving for thai. Nice food choice at an okay price rate. My only complaint is there's not enough parking when you arrive during busy hours. The reason is because this place shares a small parking with all the business next to it.</review>

many thai items, savory, soups, noodles, pad thai, fried rice, etc. a bar has been added which is quite modern, separate from the main restaurant. service could be more personable, less business like. Food has improved and ranks well with other Thai places I've eaten at. near the University in a busy out door food court.pot stickers, fried calamari, spring rolls, egg rolls etc. prices acceptable.< /Text>

Food tasted great! But the 45 minute wait was ridiculous... And I don't mean wait to be seated, I mean the time from when we ordered our food to when we got our drinks!!! Sorry but never coming back here even if the food was delicious< /review>

I don't know what happened to this place but it has been horrible the last two times I've gone there.  The service is atrocious.  I went there and there were several tables with dirty dishes on them.  When I walked in a girl told me to write my name on a list.  I waited for quite a while before I was seated.  I told the three women that were working that there were several tables without patrons they just needed to clear off the dirty dishes.  One of the gals said "We're too busy."  I should have walked out then but I continued to wait.  When I finally was seated and they took my order I had to wait a long time for my order.  When I finally got it, it tasted HORRIBLE! It stunk like it was rancid and it tasted like it was rancid as well.  I told the waitress that I didn't like the food and all I got was a bill for  almost $20.  I paid for the food BUT I am NEVER, EVER going to that place again!  It used to be such a great restaurant, but sadly it has gone down the tube.< /text>

<Text>This local family owned gem is a favorite. A diverse selection of plates and flavors, you might find yourself torn over what to order (or returning soon to satisfy the palate)!

The family combines a hard working spirit with a welcoming kindness. The restaurant is in a select part of town and well kept.

As an added bonus, small groups of friends can stop by the adjoining Lucky Lotus bar for an after work unwind session. You can also order from the menu at the bar.

If you've never been, it's time to make it happen, we'll see you soon!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The first person was done with his meal and had to wait over an hour for others to get their meals. The staff was working hard but nothing was comped and service was included.

<review>There are lots of Thai/Lao restaurants in Merced, and this place is one of my favorite 3. Their curries are creamy and not too spicy. Their Thai Fried Rice is very aromatic and tastes great (cannot be found in other restaurants!), and their Tom-ka—coconut milk based soup—is very good too.
This place is very busy, esp. during Friday and Saturday nights, so wait times could be very long, and sometimes customer service is only OK.< /review>< Gmap_id>

This place has the best Thai food in town! We go here a couple times a week!  My kids love the Chicken phat tai and Sticky rice! Cant beat the price either 13$ is a great deal for feeding a family of 4! The people are always so friendly and I love the take out option too! Its always fast, fresh and still hot when I get home! I highly recommend them for their PHO too! BEST IN TOWN!!!</review>

Thai Cuisine II became our go-to spot for years. Originally, we came for phö, but after we began to explore the menu, we quickly found that it was impossible to be disappointed by anything on the menu.
Three weeks ago, my boyfriend and I came to Thai cuisine for the last time, the night before we moved away. We ordered the same great food, and received the same great service we had been for years. 10/10 to every aspect of Thai Cuisine.

They have great food, my personal favorite is duck noodle soup with rice noodles, and crispy tofu. The food comes out very quickly usually and the waitresses are very friendly.

Fairly average Thai food, nothing much standing out. I got the lunch special pad khing (10$ish), it wasn't bad or worth going out your way for. The wait was a little long, and it wasn't too busy when I was there (late lunch).<//review>

Customer service was terrible. We waited 40 plus minutes for our order and all the customers that came in after we did had already received their food before us by now. The waitress then comes by and asked if we had gotten our food yet, like really lady do you see any food on my table and you were the one to greet and take our order. I just got up and left. I would give this place a 0 if that was an option.  Definitely never going back here again.<//Text>

<Review>Best thai restaurant ever! I'm there a few times a month and never have a problem with service. If you're waiting on food its because its good and they're busy because of that fact. Also, I tip well so maybe that's why we get good service. Any negative ratings here can be dismissed. If you don't want to wait for great thai food, just check in with Google and see who's not busy and go there. Or you can call in for a pick up order and have your yummy food in the comfort of your home.
Must haves; Pad Thai, Pier warn I think its called and pineapple fried rice.
Must trys; Tom yum  and theres a shrimp dish that's served on lettuce and drizzled in a thai peanut sauce. It's the best! But I forget the name. Just about everything on the menu is good
Except the BBQ beef. A bit plain for me but maybe not for you.
The atmosphere is nice and the service is great. So stop reading reviews and get you some yummy stuff at Thai II or I< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I’ve been here before and generally the good is great and the wait time is minimal (25 minutes max). This last time I came with friends and it’s been 50 minutes and I am still waiting for my food. Unacceptable!< /text>

The saving grace is that the food is really good, the staff needs some adjusting. I've had encounters both for take out and dining in where the girls were rude and acted like they were being bothered to do their job.< /review>

The restaurant is clean, and the food is delicious. I had the pad se ew and crispy tofu, and both dishes came out relatively fast. The staff is friendly as well. They are mostly busy in the evenings but during the afternoon is usually a good time to go to avoid waiting.</Review>

Ordered Vegetable Curry and after waiting nearly an hour for my order, the only vegetables in the curry were potatoes, lots of onions, and a few carrots. So, slow service and sub-par food is not a place I’ll go back to.</review>

Fast service. When you drive up they instantly help you and answer any questions you may have. Calling over the phone can help, but the lady on the phone doesn't speak English very well. When you drive up, someone who does speak English helps you out and is super helpful! And they have affordable tires! Definitely recommending this place to my friends in LA who need a quick tire change.<//review>

I would give them 5 stars, if they did alignment on lowered cars.  If you drive anything factory spec, this is the place for you.  They do awesome work and offer fair prices for installation.  4/5 stars!< /review>

I love their service. Have been coming to them in and off for years now. Yesterday my tire was low I took it in and ended up getting two used front tires and they got me really good used ones. I trust this place.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Dishonest and just plain rude. Came here with tears in my eyes asking if they can patch my tire just enough for me to get home. There was a small hole causing a little bit of air to leak, the receptionist came out and said no fix I must replace the tire. So the tire technician didn’t even look at my tire. I told him that’s fine but if he can just patch it so I can get home & my dad can have a look at it. Said no and insisted i get a new tire. Since he refused to fix it, I left. Obviously leaving upset he saw that I began to cry and he turns to the other receptionist and starts laughing. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL and POS do you have to be to laugh at someone who is already upset?? I went down the street to Fernando’s Tired and he fixed my tire for $10 and said I can still drive it until I have the $$$ to fix it. So they basically just tried to scam me. He saw a was a young girl who didn’t know much about cars so he tried to take advantage . Take your business elsewhere !</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Super nice guys who got me a new tire in a bind and showed up last minute near closing. They didn't complain and got me out of there quickly and cheaply. They get a hearty recommendation from me.< /text>

Oh it was Sunday and most tire stores were closed, but I was on the east side of LA and remembered Vitess tires. They totally hooked me up with new treads in at a great price in short order! Like the owner was out working with everyone, making sure all was done right. Best.</Text>

Been coming to Richard and Dara for over 20 years. I've patched tires, bought tires, bought wheels, gotten alignments. Great service and team. Good pricing. Solid neighborhood business that I support.< /Review>

What a great experience! Came in stressed out and in need of one tire just to get back on the road, left happy and safe with two new replacements for cheap used tires that I was scammed on. Plus a little extra that I noticed but wasn’t mentioned by the owner who did a nice thing just to do it. It changed my whole day and they have a life long customer because of it. THANK YOU VITESS 🙏</review>

I like this shop! They sell tires as well but i primarily come here for alignment. For my particular car, a 2015 Toyota Camry they charge $55 which is fixed. I have called in several times over the months at different times of the day to see if their price would fluctuate but no it remains constant. This was my third time for alignment with them. A small shop with a few chairs and benches for seating, no frills but very professional people.</review>

A great, no-nonsense tire shop that offers quick-service at reasonable prices. They also offer a new and used tires as well as tire repair services. This is my place of preference over Costco for all my tire needs.<//review>

Very good local spot. I've been coming here for about 5 or 6 years. They're quick, affordable, and will usually give you a discount if you pay cash, since it's not a big chain.<//review>

Ordered some aftermarket rims and a set of new tires. Got them mounted, balanced, alignment, and set of lug nuts for a great price. They will order what you want and suggest other tires just from their tire knowledge. No pressure in buying what they have in stock versus what you want as well. Great service, and they open weekends.<//Review>

This is my go-to tire shop.  I went in to VItness to get one of my tires checked out - it had a screw in it.

Once I parked in the garage, the owner came out to inquire about the service I needed.  I told him about the screw in the tire and he said that because the screw was on the side of the tire, there was nothing that could be done to repair it.

FYI- if you get a screw/nail in your tire, that tire is reparable only if it is on the thread (middle of the tire).  If it is on the side, it is not reparable and a new tire is needed.

I verified this information using my smart phone - hey you never know...I certainly didn't.

The guy said he'd pull it out with the hope that just on the surface and hence no replacement would be needed.  Alas, that was not the case, as when he started pulling the screw out, the tire started deflating.

The unfortunate thing is I had just replaced my tires no more than a year ago - still lots of miles to go.

The entire replacement of my tire was $85 including tax.  Overall, the service was done professionally and quickly.  I was in/out in 20 minutes.< /text>

<text>This place is amazing! Kim, our waitress, was great. Very knowledgeable and super friendly- she definitely made our experience 10X better!!! We came to celebrate our friends 21st bday and although they don’t serve alcohol, they surprised her with a birthday muffin topped with a fun sparkler! Would definitely recommend coming here for a chill night or a fun night out<//text>< Pictures>

Been wanting to check this hookah cafe out for a while. Looks very elegant and the employees are very friendly and accommodating. The hookah tastes great. I had the blue mist. Ordered a pomegranate tea as well and it smells divine! Looking forward to seeing this place grow. Crystal and Abdullatif welcomed me and checked up on me multiple times.</text>

The newer waitress is AMAZING! Friendly, outgoing and makes fun recommendations for flavors. I’d highly recommend trying out this place if you’re new to hookah or just looking for a chill place to hang. Definitely will be coming back. Thank you!!<//Review>

This place is awesome!! I very much like the mood of it, as it is dark but lightened in different colors. The seats are very comfortable and the music is great! Besides it's not so loud so you can have a conversation with your coupled. The service is good! It's a very chill place, very clean and organized. The type of place where you can relax, and enjoy the night. I will definitely keep coming back!<//text>

Simply amazing. I have no words. Those guys are great. Absolutely astonishing, I've smoked in many hookah lounges across the country and this spot perfect to come just to sit back and chill. Great service and very good taste in hookah! Their unique hookahs can make anyone come back for more! Trust me just try it! You won't be disappointed!<//review>

From the moment you walk in you are greeted by a friendly staff who just make a rounded experience. Plus the actual setting of the venue was made to make you wowed.

Tis lounge is definitely something new for the area, I like their vibe and it shows that they care for their costumers. My friends and I had special requests for hookah and some drinks and they accommodated us perfectly. I cannot wait for them to open again.<//Review>

<Text>The vibe here is so chill. The area looks part hipster part earthy and upscale all at once if that makes any sense. It is pretty much The best vibes coffee and hookah  you’re used to ( quiet bright businesses) and that’s what makes it ten times better. The location is the best in San Diego.

I highly recommend I’ll definitely go back< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80d9556cdd18abbd:0x323aaf9b3550f4c7< /Gmap_id><name>YOUSEF ALANSARI</name><Time>1611869233258< /Time>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This is my favorite hookah lounge in all of san Diego  I drive 45 minutes to go to it. It is a great place to go and relax during the first couple of hours that they're open. Prices are cheaper during that time as well.

The hookah is always on point. A crazy amount of good flavors to chose from!

They have free Wi-Fi, a desserts , you can chose your favorite songs , some big screen TV's, and my favorite, food ,and a lot option drinks
and the owner Mohammad is an awesome man ,he would help fo anything you ask for .
These are the types of places that you should go out of your way to try and not one of those "you should go if you have the chance. Mint lounge<//Review>< Pics>

However, every time I've gotten invited here I hear the manager yelling at his employees. The service is really really really slow & he only has one poor girl doing all the work last time I was in. I would ask whoever I can to get the check for the table & we would never actually get it until we ask several times. I like the drinks & the hookah however the staff looks really over worked. I would definitely suggest more staff ! And alsooo to be nicer to your staff !</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I love this place, even if you don’t smoke hookah (which is good here), they have organic coffee and a nice menu with boba teas and other delicious treats. It’s perfect to hang out with your friends in an upscale lounge like this.< /review>

Best Cafe and hookah lounge Spot in San Diego hands down they have specific flavours  that you can't find anywhere and trust me when I say this ANYWHERE. GREAT HOSPITALITY AND GREAT PRICES FOR STICKS HIGHLY RECOMMEND FROM THIS lounge</Review>

“Love the staff at mint lounge very attentive and kind. Wide variety of hookah flavors, one of my favorite tabacco fruit mixtures is watermelon-mint and kiwi. You must try  the humms and Lebneh entree. DELICIOUS!! Overall great hookah bar. LOVE IT!!</text>

The inspection only takes about 10 minutes & they get you on your way. They could use some better signage to help you find the way in & where to park, but other than that I have no complaints.

In response to the reply posted by the business.  First off, I am sorry!  I thought I was reviewing the first place I went, who was charging almost $80.  I have changed my review to reflect the great experience I had at your place.  That being said, it doesn't come across as being customer service oriented, when you state that not only did I not come to your place (because I did; with 3 different cars; have been for many years when I worked in Kearny Mesa) and that it's a fake email account.  No one believes a business that instantly writes off a review as being fake.
I would recommend engaging the writer of the negative reviews, as finding the motivation for their opinion will usually help improve your business.

So, in summation, thanks for the great service.  Sorry for mixing up the other business with yours, and please be more pensive before slamming someone who may have legitimately posted their thoughts.</Review>< UserId.>

First time I came here just because other smog check test station was closed. The building was easy to find but actually the station is behind the building so use the side narrow entrance to go in.  Luckily I was able to use the yelp 20%off coupon for it.
Service was really quick and this is decent place.<//Review>

I have been a customer for years. Today the young man who did the testing
was extraordinary. My 40 year old car had failed elsewhere. He solved the
high pressure leak by refreshing the gas cap gasket. He parked the car in
the parking area. When I went to start it - no luck. The battery was suspect
and he got the jump starter but no result. I recalled that recently I was having
trouble with the gear shift lever. I called AAA for a tow but this young man
Researched the problem on the Internet, came up with the solution so I could
drive home. Service above & beyond what could be expected.

A trusted shop, I have been going here for well over 10 years.  Just finished a smog check for a minivan this afternoon in 20 minutes after not needing one for any of my vehicles for 5 years.  Nothing has changed, same no-frills location and test bays.  Standard listed prices are clearly posted but they usually quote you a discounted price so just ask.  No reason to go anywhere else until they stop doing business! Only improvement would be longer weekday and Saturday hours but if you can make an appointment ahead of time, all is good.<//text>

The guy was ready for me to fill out paperwork, and the whole thing was done and over in 30 minutes.Thank goodness for google. And THANK YOU, South Cal Smog Test Only Sta!< /Text>< Pics>

Bought a beautiful 2000 Yukon with aftermarket headers... needed to smog it to transfer title...   use South Cal Smog often...  not any more!...  he tells me he cannot smog it without a tag that missing...   called the mfgr and is told the tag is welded to the unit in the same location.... this car passed smog every other year for 15 years no problem...  this shop told me to come back tomorrow and it already took hours of my day..  took it elsewhere. .. passed in 15 minutes...  no more</text>

This place is beyond amazing.  Nobody would smog my truck, luckily I found this place.  I was in and out with my certification in a flash, for a great price.  They literally treated me like I was part part of the family.  Perfect.<//Text>

All of it was very good! The Mac and Cheese was my favorite! The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.< /Review>

This restaurant is the one I always prefer. I go to plenty of restaurants but to this restaurant I go the most. The stuff is very receptive and the cooking they cook is so fresh and tasty. I never decline to have a decent meal here. Highly recommended.< /review>

<text>Not sure what justifies the 3.9 rating but maybe it’s the fastidious clientele of Mill Valley. Judging this purely from the food, it was perfect. I really couldn’t believe this was the sister restaurant from the Beach Chalet from the other side of the bay. Whatever you do though, get a reservation! It was tough being a walk-in and having to hang out next to the hostesses in the front. Great experience!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJlHqI0lB-a2Gz2K50sxxmdcyJeYeNY-IR5qsH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq_nnmflE1cnD3aTxq0RDQf2m8n35I-x9kZqhf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4c8oNL8O_pSlX4PWQpKfNTnzpBE1om2erPhvU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< UserId.>

We only stopped in to get a taste of the place for an after dinner cocktail and ended up having a few delicious craft cocktails. The bar keep who was bar tending today served delicious drinks with fantastic knowledge of the menu. Definitely left wanting to come back to try the scallops and one of the bottled cocktails. The menu comes with wonderful stories of the trail work that represents Mill Valley and the history from Mount Tamalpais. The only thing we would change was the old fashioned being watered down after sitting in ice too long before being served.<//Text>

<text>Experience and food was nice until the end... disclaimer we went during covid so we anticipated the experience to be a little different. It was out door seating at the time. Only one waitress so naturally the service was slow but it was nice the owner came over and talked to us (nice touch) however near the end of the service we were waiting for dessert and the waitress put the spoons on the picnic table without a cover or napkin and instantly my mind went “germs”. Some time went by and dessert still wasn’t out so we decided we didn’t need it anyways and decided to go up front and pay. The owner questions why we didn’t want dessert and I nicely explained the spoon situation and waiting but told her it’s totally fine we really didn’t need it anyways. The owner didn’t under stand and said “they are only your germs on the table” she ended up taking some money off our bill (or so I thought at the time) I still tipped and went about our day. Looking back at my credit card statement the restaurant charged me extra ($100 more) then what I authorized and since I didn’t keep my copy of the receipt I can’t dispute it. Lesson learned keep recipes because there are dishonest people out there.</text>< pictures>

<review>HIDDEN GEM IN MARIN.

I went in Monday, and they had their new Gravity Prime Rib menu... WOW!!

This is my 3rd time going to Gravity, the atmosphere there is great. Lighting is low, as well as ambient sound (even when full) making it easy to maintain a good and enjoyable conversation with whoever you are with. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable from what I have experience.

Food prices are good for food that is local and organic; and the seafood is caught the same day from what I was told.

The Prime Rib Monday is a great deal.

You get a 3-course meal.
A salad, a 12oz  prime rib with baked potato (it was delicious), and a pudding at the end that you will love even if you thought you weren't a pudding type of person (true story ;) )

They serve some type of made in house bread and butter.
Totally worth it for $35, i would definitely recommend gravity to anyone looking for great quality food and cocktails, oh and its family owned.

Ive been twice for lunch. Had their burger. Not impressed. The bun to ratio was way off. The top part of the bun was thick and the bottom part was really thin. Generally I like the thickness to be even. Wanting the bottom to help soak up all the juices. The taste was good/fair because of this reason. thought may be it was a fluke but it was done the second time the same way.<//review>

We stopped by Gravity Tavern for happy hour after hiking the Tennessee Valley Trailhead. We enjoyed some cocktails (the strawberry rose lemon drop is delicious!) along with a few small plates. The tater tots were unique (sort of a deep-fried potato puree) and the Gravity Sliders (we tried The Cow and The Bird) were delicious. We received friendly and excellent service, and would be back - if we were locals!< /text>

Excellent service, food & atmosphere. Scallop appetizer was so tasty and perfectly done. Burger my new favorite. Tator tots should win a competition.
Everyone so friendly.< /review>

Former Balboa is now an upgraded and inviting dining experience. Lobster bisque is worth a visit. Menu of eclectic starters such as ahi tuna poke and tomato and burrata to hearty entrees from steelhead and Alaskan halibut to coq au vin and braised shortrib. Weekend brunch and kids menu avail.<//review>

<review>Only go there if you love Salt, loads of it. this is a (bad) pub grub disguised into a foodie place, except they cant even do burger or fries right.  There were 4 of us and all dishes were way too salty. it's unbelievable that anyone would go there more than once.</review>< Pictures>

Very comfortable seating everywhere even the high tops away from the bar. Go often to try ALL the options. The far back room looks like a very special, quieter, secret spot to be. Fried Scallop Starter, EXCELLENT. Coq au Vin, tasty. Popovers with herb butter, pay whatever it takes to get TWO!! Old Fashion was done VERY well and quite good. Strawberry Hill, a perfect cocktail, try one. EXCELLENT food+ drinks and amazing atmosphere will have you to returning often.

On the down side, service was slow, fresh Rigatoni Pasta too al dente and boring by itself, (needed the fried chicken or something with a jolt of flavor). Halibut Crudo was fishy. Japanese Sidecar cocktail, not a fan.<//text>

<Time>1605574858551<//Time><rating>4< /rating><text>I took the time to read the reviews. I'm not sure what these 1 and 2 star people experienced, but I've been eating here once a week for a few years. The husband and wife team are friendly and it's always a conversation when I'm there. The food is good. Portions are generous. Is it a 5 star place?... no, but 5.99 for a single combo plate?... that's a deal. The selection isn't huge, but its diverse. If you want a 5 page menu... fo to a sit down place and pay twice the price. I like this place.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Eh. The food isn’t unbearable/terrible. It’s ok. Teriyaki is way too salty for me though. It’s affordable, that’s a plus. Though, the portions are  pretty conservative. So, I wouldn’t say it’s a “bang for your buck” type of deal. The server didn’t seem like he wanted to be there either...</review>

I have been eating at Tasty China for years. The prices are reasonable & the portion sizes are good. Selection is somewhat limited but they have my typical favorites like fried rice, beef broccoli & orange chicken. I have never had a bad experience here with the service or the food. A solid choice for quick Chinese takeout.</Review>

<Text>I can only speak about the wings and they were AMAZING!!!!

First time in my life I got an order of wings in a traditional carry out box that needed rubber bands to stay closed. Best $11 in wings of my life. 10/10 would recommend this place and its wings.< /Text><Time>1580086381614< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80d9505a88076a6b:0x1db9b860ea1e167d</Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

<text>The little gem has good food that you can eat in or take out. They serve the typical dishes as well as  salt and pepper wings which rival other Chinese establishments wings. So happy to have a Chinese fast food in the neighborhood!< /text>< pics>

Wings are hard as a rock, chow mein was soggy, the beef and broccoli was disgusting the meat tasted old and the broccoli wasn't fresh super soggy no crunch.  The orange chicken is ok and so is the rice.  Never coming here again.  Waste of money and we didn't eat the food!<//Text>

<time>1432875710256<//time><rating>2< /rating><review>I've been going here and enjoying the food for over 15 years. It was The Best! The food was always well prepared and well seasoned, and if it was getting old they would make a fresh batch for me. Just went in, and discovered new owners. The couple that had been running it had retired. Now what? I went ahead and got what they had. The fried rice was OK. The noodles were greasy and soggy. The orange chicken was too sweet, but OK. The beef and broccoli was actually pretty good. The mushroom chicken...it obviously had seen better days. The tray was over 1/2 full, and I didn't want to eat what I saw in there. I asked them to make fresh, which they did while I waited. The cook came in with about 1 cup of fresh mushroom chicken...AND PROCEEDED TO STIR IT INTO THE INEDIBLE STUFF IN THE TRAY! Then he served me some of the mostly bad mushroom chicken. I was so shocked I couldn't say anything. How did it taste? The only seasoning was salt, but the chicken tasted like fish that had gone bad. It went into the trash. I couldn't help wondering how long they had been adding fresh stuff into the old stuff. Don't they know you are not supposed to serve horrible food to your customers? The dishes I had ranged from OK to bad. I am NOT going back there.<//review>< pics>

The do not take orders what you to eat cold food on the line because they don't want to make hot food. That's just being lazy should just close if they don't want to offer hot orders, what's the purpose of a menu if your going to take orders from it...terrible place go to another restaurant...< /Review>

Wow!  I am in disbelief. I have never been treated in such a horrible manner and I have never been disrespected the way that the two owners treated me. I will never again in my life come to this restaurant because of their horrible customer service and uncooked food that they serve. My first experience at this restaurant was terrible as well because the food was uncooked but I decided to give them a second chance. I will never come back!!!!!< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This store had a beautiful selection and definitely had unique dresses to try on. I had an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime, experience choosing my wedding dress at Vivienne Atelier. I had tried on dresses at other stores, but didn't have the bridal moment. I was starting to worry I wouldn't find my dress, until I went to Vivienne. My consultant was kind, knowledgeable, upbeat, and extremely helpful. She put me at ease and made the experience really fun. I can't recommend this salon enough! Thank you Vivienne team for helping me choose my perfect gown!<//Text>< pictures>

What an amazing experience! THANK YOU GABBY! Gabby was my personal stylist this past Saturday 3/27/21 for my bridal appointment. I had appointments scheduled at 4 different places that day. Vivienne being my second. Upon arrival the staff was super friendly and helpful. My maid of honor and one of my bridesmaids were with me and they too felt very welcome. Gabby asked what kind of styles I liked, what type of venue my wedding would be in, and what kind of vibe it would be. I showed her a few pics of my inspiration and what I liked from the prior shop. Gabby brought me a few dresses and they were all beautiful in their own way, but I fell in love with one in particular. She made sure to adjust and clip everything to fit my body perfectly before standing on the podium to see the full dress. Her attention to detail was impecable. I went on about my day to the next appointments, and I just could not stop thinking of the experience I had at Vivienne Atelier compared to the others, and not to mention THE DRESS I fell in love with. No other dress or stylist compared. Immediately after my last appointment of the day I called Vivienne Atelier and told them I wanted to go back and order my dress. I went back, they took my measurements, and let me try it on one more time. The shop was great working with my budget as well. The dress has been ordered! I hope the rest of the transaction goes as smooth as this first experience. At the moment the only downside is they do not have a seamstress within their store, but they did mention they have one they work with and send their customers to. I highly recommend this bridal shop. It was everything I expected and more.< /Text>

<Text>My daughter, her dad & his wife, his sister and myself went to our first "Flash Sale"...we didn't know what to expect. If it was going to be chaotic and having to use whistles when we found my daughter's wedding dress. But, it was just great. We were first in line and my daughter actually found her dress that we were supposed to look for, in our first 3 choices. Without having to get back in line. The ladies at VIVIENNE ATELIER were just great. And on top of all that, her dress was. $2000 OFF REGULAR PRICE...</Text><date>1545732551647</date><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoupzxl_xbMm-dyfosbycAYCTi6gTGBkgJz5ex=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2NJI16-IMHqoO4roGUy9Rhz3T8GanNgAsitQ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><username>Marlene Lorenzana<//username><Gmap_id>0x80c2c70bf0462529:0xba57d5c731b9371c</Gmap_id><UserId.>116993229964570264382< /UserId.>< Rating>

If you are looking for a truly personalized, private, fun and caring experience, I highly recommend Vivienne Atelier. My appointment was an absolute delight.

Before finding Vivienne , I was avoiding dress shopping because I was afraid that every dress I'd try on would only make me feel more awkward and terrible. BUT, when I got there, it was an awesome setting, and my consultant was super helpful and supportive -- and I'm not kidding, every dress I tried on, I felt good in and I liked!

The fabrics they use are soft, comfortable, and luxurious. I loved their styles and I could tell they are made by talented, dedicated designers and dressmakers, not a marketing team that's more concerned with bottom lines than happiness. The whole environment made me so comfortable and I felt like I was really listened to and understood.

If you have been dreaming about wedding dress shopping, this place will put you over the moon. If you are anxious about it, or even dreading wedding dress shopping, this place will make it a fun and wonderful experience. Either way, you win!<//text>

Beautiful bridal salon with so many gorgeous dress options. I LOVE my dress and the level of customer service I've received. They've made the whole process as seamless as possible. The best part about my experience was my consultant, She was absolutely perfect, knew just what would fit my style and body type, and was so sweet/personable. You can tell she genuinely cares about her clients as she remembered everything we talked about during my first appointment. Needless to say my experience would not have been the same without the awesome customer service she provided and her "we can definitely make that work" outlook on customizing my dress. Thanks, Vivienne Atelier!< /review>

I tried on 7 gowns and actually ""said yes"" to the second gown. The shop itself is gorgeous and the dressing area is super cute. My bridal consultant was amazing. She made me feel confident and comfortable. She made me and my friends laugh. She did not rush us or pressure me into purchasing. She even encouraged me to take my time and shop around if I wanted to but I had such a great time that I knew my gown was ""the one"" and I said yes! It was even way under my budget. I highly recommend Vivienne to future brides!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>My sister chose this place for wedding dress shopping (for her), and I LOVED IT! Super friendly, warm, welcoming, and they never made my sister feel like a burden for wanting to try on dresses, or fitting it a certain way.

Absolutely my favorite experience at a bridal shop! They had such a variety of dresses and I was able to find my dream dress at a fair price. The staff made me feel special and valued this experience as much as I did! I would recommend Vivienne Atelier to any bride in search of their dream dress.</text>

All I have to say is WOW! We had the best experience with Vivienne Atelier. My consultant made me feel so comfortable with the whole process of choosing a dress, going through fittings, and pre wedding day jitters. I would recommend this bridal shop to anyone who wants a gorgeous gown in LA.< /Review>

I requested an appointment online and was contacted the next day to schedule, awesome customer service! Also, from the time I entered the building, all of the employees were welcoming and made me feel completely comfortable. During my appointment, I was assisted by Jasmine. They took such care and attention to listen to what I was looking for and even assisted with me picking out some dresses to try on along with headpieces. Vivienne was the first bridal shop that I visited and the experience and atmosphere (along with the amazing dress selections) made me not want to look elsewhere! Definitely recommend Vivienne for all future brides!</Text><user_id>111679919681168671093<//user_id>< name>

<text>Beautiful dresses! The material is very high quality. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They made my dress experience so amazing. I felt like the most important girl in the shop. They knew what I wanted just by a description and what I thought I wouldn't like from what they pulled for me, I loved and it became my wedding dress. They have years of experience and know exactly what they're doing.

Vivienne Atelier has a great selection of stunning wedding dresses to meet a wide variety of budgets. They carry designers that I wasn't able to find at other locations and have great pricing and discounts. The team at Vivienne was very flexible and accommodating, even though I was running 30 minutes late for my appointment, and knew exactly when to offer input and when to take a step back and let me make my own judgement. They were all very professional, and extremely friendly. I love my new wedding dress and would recommend them to anyone!</Text>

I had a great experience at Vivienne Atelier. The service was amazing - the entire staff is super nice and helpful. The selection of gowns is great. They have a lot of the designers including some unique brands that only they carry. They offer a range of price points and really work with brides to make them happy. Would recommend to any bride.< /text>

This entire process was so easy. From booking my appointment to finding my dress. The team at Vivienne took all of the stress away. I had a Sunday appointment. I received one on one care from my consultant Tebby.

When I arrived they immediately began pulling by getting a better understanding of what I was looking for and what I expected to find. I found my dress in less than 45 minutes. I was absolutely amazed at how perfectly it fit and I appreciated Tebby towards all the dresses I tried on. I highly recommend this shop!</review>

I went to this bridal shop and they pretended to be cocomelody went through a whole fitting with me when I on multiple times said I was there for a cocomelody appointment which is 7 floors above them.They did all this to poach a sale.I flew all the way from Ohio to Los Angeles with my mother,bridesmaid we rented a car,airbnb only to be deceived when at any point they could have told us we walked into the wrong store. I wasted an entire trip. This was so deceptive and I now have no opportunity to try on the dresses i flew across the country for and am seriously heartbroken.Shame on you! I would never reccomend this store spend your money elsewhere!< /text>

OMG I said YES to my Dream Dress!!!!!! Thank you so much to Carla for helping me pick out my Dress. Carla made the experience the Best experience. Vivienne was the first store I went to with my family. I had done some research prior to going Dress Shopping. I had a completely different dress in mind and left with my Dream Dress. It was the first Dress I tried on. To walking out of the fitting room and seeing my Moms and sister reaction was something I will never experience in my life. I had left my family in tears. I can't wait till my Wedding day and my Husband to be sees me in my Wedding Dress. Vivienne made my Dress Shopping the Most Memorable day.<//Text>

<Review>My first and second appointment was so wonderful. The stylists are so nice and make you feel like a friend and not just another customer. They made me feel at ease. I was so indecisive and I told Jacky what I liked and what I didn't like and the first dress she picked for me was perfect. i knew when i looked at the dress and put it on that it was the one. Thank you ladies so much for making this process so enjoyable !!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1557523025474, 'text': 'Thank you for the review and coming and trusting us with your wedding dress needs !'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>I truly loved my experience with Vivienne Atelier from start to finish. The customer service was unparalleled, the attention to detail was immaculate, and most importantly the insanely intricate dress I dreamed up in my head came to reality. The dress was exactly what I was looking for and fit amazingly well (it only had to be shortened a bit, no other alterations were required). I would definitely recommend Vivienne Atelier to any bride looking for an affordable and unique wedding dress!</review><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I went bridal dress shopping with my mom, sister and dad here a couple of weeks ago.  I had just started and this was the first place I looked.
The experience started out really wonderful, but the end kind of took the joy out of it.

Picked up my dress today and I'm so happy with it!! Not gonna lie, I was worried since this is the first custom anything I've ever done. The team has been a pleasure to work with, very accommodating and strive their best to achieve customer satisfaction. And I am completely satisfied! They've kept me updated via email throughout the entire process and always asked me for input on specific design decisions (like special lace and beading). Luckily, today was my first fitting and it fit PERFECTLY! I was nervous because of the change my body went through since I first came in for my measurements, but my dress is beautiful and comfortable! Needless to say, I didn't need any major alterations. Lucky, lucky, me!

At times I did feel unsure of my initial decisions, but they always had input and recommendations to make my vision come to life. I can't tell you enough how happy I am with the turnout (and turn around time). IMO, it's a great price for the customization - when you think about it, the dress is made to YOUR measurements and YOUR proportions. They aren't cutting off detail at the bottom like most "off the rack" places, because they make it to fit you! They know what they're doing, and even ask ahead of time how all you think your heels will be to make the length of the dress just perfect. On your first visit, just bring in pictures of all the dresses you love and are inspired by and they will work with you. Trust the process!! I will say though that there were times where I was unsure of their recommendations (because I don't have that designer eye and it's hard to envision everything coming together when you're nervous about a custom order). But the finished product will leave you feeling elated! Thank you team, you ladies are the best! I'll post pictures after the big day!<//Text>

No complaints at all. Been coming to the store for several years now with great customer service, positive interaction, clean environment and nothing but great service each visit. I dont mind the card charge. My favorite liquor store by far in Stockton. Keep up the great work and service! Definitely a customer for life. Actually headed there in a few before closing time lol</review>

Went here for a Thai massage and followed it up with a classic facial by Kimberly (who was amazing btw.No need for a lengthy review. 4 stars speaks for itself. In the words of Drake, "best I've ever had."I will definitely be returning!< /Text>

< Review>
most massage places I have been to just put lots of oil on and rub it in, what I enjoyed about this place is she applied pressure like a chiropractor and didn't use much oil. will definitely go back..</Review>

Linda is a wonderful masseuse. I had a really bad stiff neck and lower back pain and she took it away. She's intuitive and from her experience, knows where to take out the knots in your muscles. Place your trust in her knowledgeable hands to get the best massage experience ever! The place is quiet, private and very clean.< /text>

< Review>
What a wonderful experience.  A welcoming and relaxing environment.  My massage therapist was fantastic and professional -- I wish I got his name.  It was both relaxing and therapeutic as he worked out some super tight muscles, checking throughout on how much pressure to use.   The stretching was heavenly.   Almost next door to the hotel I was staying at.<//Review>

<Text>Awesome place! I just finished a 45 min massage with Priscilla, she was so nice and a very good masseuse. There is free parking in the back. The front door is kinda tricky to find so come a little earlier for your first appointment. I will definitely be back!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2b6dce7375755:0x7d9f47a95b791ef9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We headed towards the back and I told the staff it was freezing. They said their heating unit was broke. I was upset bc they should’ve told me this before I paid my money. I asked for some heat and they brought a mini heater into the spa room. I must say the message was great although it was still cold. We thanked everyone and was headed towards the exit.

I normally work from home, but after working hard in LA for 5 days with backbreaking physical labor i was a mess. Got an incredible great deep tissue massage at a good price before my flight & woke up feeling much better. Very nice place. Quiet, clean, polite. Very nice & conveniently located near LAX shuttle. Great!</review>

<text>I travel to LA for business and was waiting for my flight. Did a 1 hr deep tissue. It was amazing, the lady was kind, she even went over 60min to properly finish the massage and did not cut me short. I get messages 1to2 times a month and this was one of the best I've had.< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>Super nice staff. I called in when I was sitting  in traffic on the 405. The traffic was inspirational to seek a local massage place. Luckily they had availability to see me right away. I got the Thai herb massage for 60 min.  It was heavenly.

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Simply put: the best Thai massage I have found in Los Angeles CA.  I have been twice, I experienced two different masseuses, and BOTH times I left feeling completely worked over, total body devastation, IN A GOOD WAY!  They turned me into jelly, which my body desperately needed.

On my most recent visit my therapist was fantastic and I am completely comfortable recommending her. She spoke English perfectly, which seems to be not common at these Thai massage businesses, she understands THE LANGUAGE OF THE BODY.  She gave me the pressure I needed and checked in with me to make sure it was okay.  You could tell her hands and feet were experienced and she was responding to the feedback my body was giving her without my having to speak it out loud.  (Which is good, given that I was face down for at least half the time.)

Whatever screening process they use for their staff, whatever school or training academy they are recruiting them from (presumably somewhere in Thailand, but who knows) it's working.

I booked a 90-minute session, which included 30 minutes of foot reflexology, and I have to tell you, probably the best massage in my life.  I went in a ball of tension and I left feeling like a blissed out quivering mound of jelly.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b6dce7375755:0x7d9f47a95b791ef9< /gmap_id></record>

Massage was pretty good but apparently they only do your back if you get the 30 min.  I remember getting 30min before here and it was full body.  I wish I knew before paying.  40 dollars plus 10 tip for a pretty nice back rug and a hot towel.<//review>

<Text>I visited The Red Pearl Thai Massage yesterday what I was intending to get was a relaxing deep tissue massage. What I got was a painful 90min horrible experience. The masseuse was very rough to the point where I was raising out of the bed. I asked her more than a handful of times if she could stop being so rough. Let's just say she didn't. After the 90min massage was over, I felt like I needed a body cast, because I could barely walk, from the back and leg pain I was having. It was a horrible experience and I could have used the $100 I spent on something way more fulfilling. To top this horrible experience off, when I finished the massage, I waited in the front lobby for my friend to come out. The front receptionist and the masseuse stood at the counter and stared at me as I was getting ready to sit down, and said... Aren't you going to leave a tip. I was livid. Why would I leave a tip for a service that I was totally not satisfied with. I will NEVER visit this place again. Horrible Experience!!!!!!!</Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Massage was OK so far, unfortunately, one at the exit almost forced to concede tip. So the customer gets a bad finish, not recommended

(Original)
Massage war soweit OK, leider wird man beim Ausgang beinahe dazu genötigt Trinkgeld zugeben. So bekommt der Kunde ein schlechter Abgang, nicht zu empfehlen</text>

<Review>I give Salon Philosophie 5 stars! The employees are very patient & professional. The stylists are considerate of your time, .you’re in and out (of course it depends on the type of service) and the shop has cool vibe! I would definitely recommend Salon Philosophie to anyone who’s looking for a  full service salon. The customer service is excellent!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1619793800741, 'text': "Thank you!

This review is long overdue!  Started going to this salon a year ago- I was looking for a salon that specialized in coloring and natural hair. Ophelia, my beautician does an excellent job! Honestly every beautician in this salon does a great job. If I could give this salon more stars are would.<//Text>

<text>So let me start off by saying....it was very very clean,very friendly, comfortable and every stylist was very professional. I got microblading as well as smoothing of my natural curly hair. Also before the procedure had taken place The Stylist had explained everything possible that needed to be known pertaining to smoothing of the hair the texture of my hair different things I can do by styling my hair while having the smoothing Solution in. Like weaves braids coloring of the Hair Etc. Also on how long it would last and what I can expect over the next few months. The do's and don't on how to protect your natural hair. And that's not only what the shop had to offer.. you can get a pedicure manicures eyelashes extensions and so much more. To me  that's what's considered in 2019 as a one stop shop. I will NEVER go elsewhere.< /text>< rate>

Joshua Bone (BONEifide) has restored my hair from the BIG CHOP of dead ends, frayed roots & fried curls to bouncy, healthy, full curls with elasticity! He helped educate me on what to do to keep it up in between appointments & was honest. Took a LONG time (years) finding the right fit (beautician) for me & now i can't see myself going anywhere else.

The shop is in a nice little area & ive never had any issues parking. The atmosphere inside is very family oriented & peaceful. Theres usually laughter & good conversations had while waiting & in the chair & im always out in a decent amount of time. Ive never seen a customer leave unhappy. Even the nail shop next door is friendly! DEFINITELY WORTH THE COSTS which are very resonable... makes you excited to TIP!< /review>

< Review>
I was referred to Salon Philosophie by an acquaintance. I was specifically looking for a make-up artist for a photo shoot. I visited the shop and was given the phone number for the make-up artist, Danielle. I called the number I was given, but after 3 days and no call back, I contacted the salon again. Unfortunately, I was given the wrong number the first time so I called the number given to me the second time. One week later still no return call. It was my first and last encounter with the salon. Professionalism goes a long way. Apparently "Danielle" doesn't care how she represents the salon, and if she cares that little why would I spend my money there?< /Review>

DON’T BOOK AN APPOINTMENT HERE, especially with CHAMPAGNE. She’s very ghetto, insecure, and completely unprofessional. She’s one of those hood girls who are vindictive, evil, and try to sabotage you. She does NOT care about your hair/scalp health. She will PURPOSELY TRY to damage your hair. I had to remove and take down the hair style immediately to avoid any damage to my hair. She deliberately braided my hair extremely tight just because she was angry I rescheduled an appointment. She ignores you when you say ouch and tries to hurt you, and will keep doing what is causing you the pain. SHE IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE. THANKFULLY I could afford a different style before leaving out of town. But not everyone has almost $200 to throw away. UNRELIABLE hair salon! These women are desperate for some coins and don’t care about how they treat their customers. You can also hear them gossiping and laughing about you the moment they walk away. If you want a quality hair salon, go to JOVANCE!!!!</text>

< review>
I was looking for a new salon in Vacaville since we relocated to this area.  Josh was listed on devacurl and Yelp showed the salon with good reviews.  I wrote to the salon through Yelp and they responded to text him directly.  I wrote to him asking for an appt and he said "he could take me" when I asked him for pricing, no response.  I called the salon for pricing, they said to text him again.  Again no response.  I cancelled my appt.  After the receptionist went and got him, Josh says he gets so many texts and calls.  Well, guess he won't miss new business and a consistent 20% tip.</review>

Placed an order for pick up. There order was scheduled for 4 and we got there early, so I'm thankful they agreed to prep it sooner. However the order was incorrectly prepped - they missed the harissa, slaw and drink on the order and instead provided extra serving of hummus and pita. The food is decent in taste and quantity for the price. The chicken was little undercooked and there was no option for customization request (such as ensuring chicken is well-done) on the online portal.<//Text>

Food was good. Unfortunately there was a back up in the line because they did not have any chicken ready during the busy dinner rush. While everything came out fine in the end, the delay in getting our food made for just an ok experience.<//Text>

Fair price, healthy and delicious food. They seem to be busy and kind of loud atmosphere. Even though the seating area was spacious I prefer the door tables for fresh air. I just hope they can get rid of the greecy smell. I'd definitely recommend this place and I'd come back again soon.<//text>

<Text>Never prompt. Mediocre service. I ordered online (at noon) for a 12:45 pick up. Food wasn't ready until after 1 and nobody was checking with guests to ensure us the orders were being worked on. At least 5-6 people were standing around waiting for their pre-orders.< /Text>< Pics>

The most unique build a bowl place I've ever been to,  by a large margin.  The variety of greens and grains to use as a base was impressive, the sauces were fresh and light, and the protein selection had spicy items that brought the whole bowl together.  Went in completely unfamiliar with most of the items available and left completely satisfied.<//Review>

This is a gluten free review.

Gluten free menu: No, but GF items clearly marked

Gluten free options: 5/5
Pretty much the entire menu is gluten free. I really appreciate that they itemize all major allergens for every item on their menu.

I do plan on asking if their falafels are actually gluten free but maybe just fried in a shared fryer. If they are gluten free then I look forward to trying them the next time around.

Food: 2/5
Portions are good for one person. Everything tasted fresh and very healthy, but kind of bland. Also, I'm a white meat chicken eater and just wasn't a fan of the meat quality. I had quite a bit of dark meat and some cartilage in my bowl, which was pretty unappetizing.

Service: 4/5
Staff was friendly and helpful at explaining how to order and what they would recommend combining in the bowl (especially sauces...there's so many options).

Location: 4/5
Super easy to park and find the restaurant

Ambiance: 3/5
Comfortable. Nothing special. Feels like any other fast food restaurant setting.

Price: 3/5
About $15 per person with a drink

Overall score: 3/5

I'll come back and give Cava one more try. Hope its a better experience the second time around.< /Text>

<text>Cava is legit. It's pricey, but you're getting a high quality meal. I just wish there were one closer to me. Everything I've tried here is excellent: red pepper hummus, regular hummus, chicken, meatballs, supergreens, saffron rice, roasted vegetables.

Again, it's not cheap, but it's good food.</text>< resp>

< review>
Fair price, healthy and delicious food. They seem to be busy and kind of loud atmosphere. Even though the seating area was spacious I prefer the door tables for fresh air. I just hope they can get rid of the greecy smell. I'd definitely recommend this place and I'd come back again soon.< /review>

Amazing food, simple setup in the seating area where the room is open and spacious! As a bonus they are on the corner suite so there are two areas to look out of which I believe makes for a great environment.

Why 3 stars for this Cava location? I placed an order online but wanted to eat at the restaurant and didn’t see an option to make it a dine in order. Upon entering the restaurant I was not greeted as all the employees where standing around talking with each other as other coworkers worked preparing food, I also had a question and had to wait to get their attention to ask them a question and about getting a water cup!

This was my first time placing or order online, not to mention going to the Cava! Upon entering the restaurant I saw two bags, on the outside the bag I didn’t see a name so I needed to look inside to find my order where upon I saw a receipt with the name on it. A name on the outside (or initials), near the top of the bag facing outward I believe would be better then having to look inside each bag, it was like I was snooping around!

It also would’ve been nice to be greeted upon entering, then seeing I was going to the area with takeout bags asked if I ordered online! To make it more personal ask for my name and point out or hand my food order to me asking if there was anything else? Water? Etc.?

Again, the food was fabulous, but having outgoing employees would’ve make the experience so much better and welcoming!
****
CAVA is amazing with their customer service as they reached out to me! For that I added one more star for 4 stars.<//Text>

<Review>This is a gluten free review.

Gluten free menu: No, but GF items clearly marked

Gluten free options: 5/5
Pretty much the entire menu is gluten free. I really appreciate that they itemize all major allergens for every item on their menu.

I do plan on asking if their falafels are actually gluten free but maybe just fried in a shared fryer. If they are gluten free then I look forward to trying them the next time around.

Food: 2/5
Portions are good for one person. Everything tasted fresh and very healthy, but kind of bland. Also, I'm a white meat chicken eater and just wasn't a fan of the meat quality. I had quite a bit of dark meat and some cartilage in my bowl, which was pretty unappetizing.

Service: 4/5
Staff was friendly and helpful at explaining how to order and what they would recommend combining in the bowl (especially sauces...there's so many options).

Location: 4/5
Super easy to park and find the restaurant

Ambiance: 3/5
Comfortable. Nothing special. Feels like any other fast food restaurant setting.

Price: 3/5
About $15 per person with a drink

Overall score: 3/5

I'll come back and give Cava one more try. Hope its a better experience the second time around.</Review>< UserId.>

CAVA. I LOVE YOU. I'm not sure how I made it this long without you. But I'm happy to say, you're in my life now, for good. To everyone else. This place is incredible. It's fast. It's fresh. Dare I say, it's a Mediterranean Chipotle. But better. (and I LOVE Chipotle.) I'm not crazy for Mediterranean food, it ranks middle between favorite and least favorite foods. I could take it or leave it. But CAVA. I visited 3 times in one week, and have been 3 other times since. I've been to 3 locations, today making the 35 mile trek, just to enjoy you. Get here people. I promise it's even better than I can convey. The portions are HUGE and the prices are low. This plate cost me $10. It might be lunch's best kept secret... Dinner too.<//Review>

Overall, I’ve had really good experience with this place. Some of the employees have been super nice to me, especially managers and Kristian. I’ve only had 1 terrible experience which made me give it 4 stars. One employee (white man) literally screamed at me for asking for a sample on top of my protein choice. He got in my face as much as you can from behind the glass and treated it like a crime. I lost it, and gave him a pep talk. The Manager took over and gave me the meal free as an apology for the guys behavior.
So they gave me a meal free.. but the employee was raising his voice at me for asking for a SAMPLE.. anyways 4/5! Best food</Text>

<Text>The bowls are large and filling, but sometimes the meat options seem a little old and cold depending on what time you go.

I usually get one of the grain bowls. There are tons of options to choose from when constructing your bowl, but sometimes the variety of ingredients and sauces is too much. They don't really limit you on how much you can put in your bowl, so if you put too many ingredients or sauces, it turns into a sloppy mess. I recommend the fresh pita chips though, with hummus. Those are my favorite.</Text>< name>

<Text>We ordered in for lunch at my company and I am a bit disappointed with the value that we received for our money.  I ordered a salad and received half a bowl of salad for almost $10, and looking at my coworker's pita wraps, I was equally disappointed because the cost exceeds what was actually received. They are so small...maybe it was an off day for the restaurant so I would try them again (and possibly dine-in in the hopes of getting more food? LOL) I wish I could say that hey, maybe the salad wilted down a little but it shouldn't have wilted down that fast if everything was delivered fresh after we ordered it.  Plus, the salad really was still fresh.  On another note, the salad tasted really good and the flavors were great.  FYI, in the picture, I put a cereal bowl next to my salad bowl for reference so that you can see the size.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHJfMG3_xz8EPbGBwBma9Rab1wo20l1nNxI5s3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtw4aC2gJPMFfaMxi7_R_KovKgU3B2bFtZY37w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0v9OX04ZQAmzxXZZntm709QStL3E6wMnfuqEs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1567538527164, 'text': 'Hi Diamond, thanks for the review and so sorry that you were disappointed with our portion sizes.

Reasonable prices, great food, totally laid back atmosphere and really good service. My girlfriend always wants to come in for happy hour whenever we are out there and I never bicker about it. I just hope she doesn't want to go all the way out there to try their brunch, because it is probably really good too<//Review>

Went there at noon on a weekday and was surprised to see the looking queue. Took us about 15mins to finally order the food but it was worth it!
Quantity was great for the price. Being a heavy eater, I felt completely full!
Quality was good too. I had a Grain bowl with brown rice and harissa honey chicken. I chose this because I like spicy food. If you do not like spicy food, then there are other options too. Use the paper menu to know the spice levels of each ingredient before you order.<//text>

This place used to be the best. It's still good, they just need to be more generous with the portions especially for the price like they used to.<//text>

The portions they give at this location are noticeably smaller than at other locations. My bowl is usually filled to the brim at the USC location, but here it was only about 70% full (with the same toppings). Please don’t be stingy with the portions.<//review>

The lamb cost $1.45 more than the other protein choices. My bowl was so flavorful my taste buds were on a rollercoaster. The people in other reviews who said it was bland must have not experimented with the dips/toppings. Plenty of seating both inside and outside. I came at 12:15 and had to wait a while in line for the lunch rush but it was worth it! I will definitely be returning!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

What a pleasant surprise. Walking up to order, I wasn't sure what to expect. Hands down, some of the tastiest Mediterranean food I have had. A fusion, if you will. Lots of combination options and you can build your own. A party of three, we all had something different and each dish was just as excellent as the next. Fresh, quality ingredients. Friendly and helpful staff. Clean environment. Look forward to returning.</Text>

<text>Their food is absolutely delicious. I can't recommend this place enough to friends/family. If you're looking for a healthy, yet flavorful meal, this is the place to go. However, if you're planning on going there around lunch during the work week, plan enough time to wait in line, as it can get very long. I did download the app and ordered online for a "to go" order multiple times, but each time I did, my meal was always missing an ingredient or two. Not a total deal breaker, because I kept going back, but it wasn't exactly what I expected when I ordered (this is the only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5).< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdc34352478d7:0x20017cf4f2a12ff8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Such delicious food! Great Mediterranean selection of protein, toppings, dressing and dips. The staff are friendly and patient (it was my first time there) and the restaurant is clean. The drink options are the best and so refreshing. I am definitely making this a favorite place to visit. I highly recommend it.</Text>< Pictures>

Fresh food, cold food was cold and the warm food was warm. Nice change to the same dining options. The grains and greens are a nice filling mix, plenty of sauce and toppings available. Try the Beet-Lemonade, tart but enjoyable.< /text>

<text>This is one of our favorite spot for a quick healthy meal. It’s the same concept as Chipotle, but we feel like we get way more food from Cava than we do at chipotle. I can never finish my bowl and end up having two meals out of it. You get 4 different options for greens and 3 options for grains. You also get pita bread without any extra charge. My favorite part of building this bowl are the dips. I always get one scoop of the crazy feta and two scoops of the harissa. For the meats we always pick the chicken and braised lamb. After the proteins, you get to add unlimited toppings such as, Pickled onions, banana peppers, olives, cucumber tomato salad, tabbouleh and a few other items. Lastly, it’s the sauce! We always cover our bowls and ask for extra of the green harissa sauce. The service is always very quick. They get you in and out! Sometimes the greens can be a little dry because it’s been sitting out for too long. So be sure to ask for a fresh batch! And depending on the server, sometimes they don’t give you enough grains or greens so be sure to ask for more of that too!<//text><UserId.>102988594962350464671</UserId.></record>

Good food, very fresh

The salad and grain selections are very fresh. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. I like the spicy lamb meatballs and the braised lamb. My friend always gets the falafels. I like the lamp so much it's hard for me to try something else. Wish they had a little bit more variety of selections.<//Review>

Don't overlook their specialty teas and juices while you're here too. Normally I'm a water guy, but here I indulge and enjoy their drinks. At CAVA, the quality and fresh take on beverages makes it worth it.

Finally, the restaurant itself is clean and open with plenty of  comfortable seating. The kitchen is open for viewing so you can see exactly whats going on, a gimmic perhaps, but it's a nice one.

Anytime we eat here, we are reminded of how good it is and are encouraged to come back. Can't say enough good things!</text><GmapID>0x80dcdc34352478d7:0x20017cf4f2a12ff8</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place to have healthy fresh food. Probably the best fast food place in Irvine right now.

Great selection of beverages and no junk from Coca Cola or Pepsi.</Review>

Delicious menu items and you can configure it for your order for your liking. I use the phone app and order ahead (due to lengthy lines at lunch) and just grab and go, or eat it there if there are tables to sit at.</text>

Great, healthy food at affordable prices. Some things can be extremely spicy, but they have a little chili icon on the menu. I love that you can build your own pitas and their selection of juices is always wonderful.</Text>

Cava grill is my favorite new restaurant because the food is fresh and very tasty. They order their ingredients daily- now that's fresh! Everytime I eat at Cava grill I am satisfied. Pretty healthy options. Staff is pleasant and professional. Very glad to finally have Cava grill in Irvine.<//Review>

The food taste good but the portions are a bit off. They hardly provide any meat, we're talking 2 small meatballs if you order half meatballs. And when you order a grains and greens bowl, they put like a half a spoon of rice, its like a bad joke. The bill ends up being like $14 just for a bowl of food, and if you don't top it with all of the extras, you'll be very disappointed in how little meat and rice actually comes with the bowl. Since you are forced to top the bowl with some extras so that you can actually feel satisfied with your meal, by the time you eat, all the meat is cold as the temperatures have mixed.

All around, I will not be coming back to CAVA due to the expensive price for a not-so-satisfying meal.< /Text>

If you're on a health kick, than this is the place for you. I would recommend the grain bowl.becuase then you can sample mostly everything here. If you don't want something with grains, find somewhere else to eat.</Text>

I really like this place and the food is always really good but they are very inconsistent with their portion. Some days I am served too much food and other days I am served too little food; but yet I still have to pay the same price? They really need to work out a better way of always making sure their customers get the same consistency of food portions. Other than that, there's not much else to complain about, the place is nice and always clean. I love their drinks as well; I try a new one every time I go, but my favorite will always be the pineapple with mint.<//Text>

This is a pretty good evolution on the Chipotle of building your bowl, Mediterranean food as well as from the food truck craze all mixed into one. I got the greens & grain bowl with the superfood mix and chicken. Get to choose three sauces, unlimited toppings and a dressing. Food is tasty and doesn’t break the bank. This one in particular is super spacious. Would def. come back.<//Text>

<Review>Cava was great. My niece and I went there for our first time after our pool PT not quite knowing what to expect and it was awesome. Best explained like a nice Mediterranean Chipotle restaurant? You start off picking a grain or salad bowl then pick a protein, sauces, etc. It's inexpensive and we'll be back next week! 😃<//Review><user_id>102302796657060424648</user_id>< resp>

I first enjoyed Cava in the D.C. metro area a few years ago. When I found out they had one in Irvine I planned two trips out this way just to have an excuse to drop in. The food is fresh, flavorful, and amazing. The staff is always helpful and patient. The only down side...there isn't a single location in Arizona.<//Review>

This was my first visit, and the team member helping me was extremely kind and helpful while answer my plethora of question.

Food was quite enjoyable, and the drink options were great, with options of non Coke or Pepsi soda, sweetened and nonsweetened tea, and a unique mix of fruit juice.

Great overall experience. Will eat here again.<//Review>

Love that this place has a lot of options. I wasn't too impressed by the chicken meat or the lentils. I got a lot of pieces that were fatty. The lentils also aren't cooked properly. They need to be cooked more and taste raw/half cooked. Meatballs are also very burnt usually. None of the workers seem to enjoy being here. 8/7 - Looking forward to improvements!< /review>

I love Cava. I stop there at least once a week for lunch. Their bowls are amazing and the speciality drinks taste great. It gets very bust around normal lunch time. I usually like to ge there before 11:30 am. Parking lot is small for how busy that section is. Parking to the side entrance might be neccessary.< /text>

Chipotle sibling, but it's Mediterranean. They serve mini pita with the bowl. If you like eating spicy, you should definitely include Harissa. For Vegan the only option is Falafel and Seasonal Roasted Vegetables as protein. I like CAVA over SAJJ Mediterranean (Same Concept).< /Text>

<review>I like this place a lot more than your standard Chipote, but I can't tell if it's because the flavor is really that much better of if it's because of the new trend. There are definitely more options than what you'd get at a Chipotle and that makes for a greater diversity of flavors.< /review>< gmapID>

The food is fresh and super tasty. The prices are very accessible and the location is very clean. And as a bonus for eco warriors like me, this is the only place I've seen so far that has biodegrable utensil and cups!</review>

Think chipotle but healthy, with vegan choices and much higher quality. We go here at least a few times a month and it's a hit with everyone, even my three year old.< /Text>

Kind of like a pieology/chipotle setup (they make the food as you go through the line) but Cava is centered around Mediterranean dishes. No matter if you live a T Rex or Brontosaurus lifestyle you'll have plenty of options hete. If you are a Vegan / Vegetarian you'll still have plenty to choose from.

Also if you're into uniquely crafted "soft drinks" they make their own drinks here.

Worth a visit or two or three. First time I visited here I ordered two times because I enjoyed their food that much.</Review>< pictures>

It tasted like a bowl of pure salt. Everything except the green was too salty so we couldn't stand it. Falefel was soggy too. We decided to throw most away and never coming back. Not healthy food. It might actually give you a heart attack due to elevated blood pressure.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1503581639085, 'text': 'Hi, Chan.

It can't be topped. I had this in Washington DC and wished it was in California and now we have it! I love it. There are many great savory and spicy options which keep it fresh and new every visit.

Your base: has 8 options, lentils, white rice, brown rice, arugula, romaine, baby spinach,  super greens mix, mesclun mix. There's no place that has as many quality leafy green options to choose from. They allow you to mix and match. My favorite is the super greens with kale brussel sprouts, broccoli, chicory, and cabbage.

The dips: They give you 3 sides to choose from out of 6 options: Hummus , a roasted red pepper hummus , tzaziki, eggplant and red pepper, crazy feta, harrisa. In my opinion, all the options taste good. When I say they taste good, I don't mean ok. Compared to other foods of this kind, they excel.

Meat: Choose 1 from 6 options. They do have a veggie option for vegetarians. I tried the lamb meat balls and chicken. Both tasted great. The meat balls were a little dry, but that's not uncommon with this style. They offer: veggies, chicken, lamb meatballs, beef, shredded lamb (very juicy) , and beef meatballs.

Dressing/Topping: I believe they have six options. I don't remember the names of any of them. I tried two and both were great tasting.

Bonus: They have pleasant service here. Washington DC isn't known for its service where this chain has many of its locations.<//Review><name>Charlton Bilow< /name><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

This is a build-your-own kind of eatery with Meditarrean food.
It was my first time there, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
The restaurant was open and bright.

There are 5 steps to order. Everything is listed on the menu.
First you can pick if you want greens, grain, pita, or a combination of things.
Second you pick the dips and spreads.
Third is picking the proteins.
Then the toppings.
Lastly the dressings.

Here were my choices:
(1) Greens + Grains - SuperGreens, Brown Basmati Rice;
(2) Tzatziki, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, Crazy Feta;
(3) Chicken + Grilled Meatballs;
(4) Tomato, Cucumber, Cabbage Slaw, Pickled Onions, Pickled Banana Peppers, Kalamata Olives, Crumbled Feta, Fresh Mint
(5) Lemon Herb Tahini, Green Harissa.

This bowl of goodies was so delicious!
It was like flavor explosion in my mouth.
Everything was good. All the meat, sauces, dips, veggies, salad, grains.. everything!
I chowed down the whole bowl, was completely full, but I wanted even more.

I am so in love with this restaurant.
Can't wait to go back again!!</text>< Pictures>
