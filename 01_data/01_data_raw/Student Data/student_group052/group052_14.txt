The staff was very friendly and communicated fluently on the status and update on my vehicle. Though it took longer than expected, it was definitely worth the wait! My car looked like it did when I bought 5 years ago! Definitely will be back and refer them to anyone that have vehicle repair needs! Excellent job Fix Auto!< /text>

It is hit-or-miss it has been back for time for warranty issues.I believe it's because the manager Walter that used to run the place is now in the Brea store. He is the best.

My vehicle was sent here by insurance for repairs. when my car was about to be done last day, I was called not once not twice but 3x’s. Reason being time of finish repair kept being pushed forwarded, and once back tracked. Really annoying to have to keep switching my schedule especially when I show up at the time they tell me it’s going to be ready and soon I walk in the office I can see through the door that leads to the back my rea lights are on the floor and my mud gaurds were being installed, I don’t appreciate lying especially being called 3 times to tell me and have me change my plans.  Would consider somewhere else</Review>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!!! They stole my property from in the car, and my trunk doesnt work at all anymore. Took my car for body work/paint and i got it back with more issues than i dropped it off with. My back up camera no longer works, it did when i dropped it off. My trunk doesnt open, it did when i dropped it off, the guy inspected the car in front of me and opened the trunk himself when i dropped it off. There was also a wheel clip jammed into my front passenger tire which wouldve caused a flat if i didnt immediately hear it. To top it off, there was an almost full box of cigarettes in the back seat and they claimed its not theirs. Nobody in my family smokes cigarettes at all, so theres no reason for a full box to be in my back seat where my 4 year old sits. Now i have to deal with my insurance again to get these guys taken care of so i repeat, BE CAREFUL AND DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!</Text>

Started out and it seemed like they were going to be very communicative And keep me posted. However I was told I would be called To keep me posted and they did not . A week later I found out That other than tearing it down nothing had been done. It might have been an insurance issue on getting back to them, but they could have called and let me know what was happening</review>

They were local so that was convenient. The office is very clean and kept professional unlike some other repair shops I have gone through. The staff is very thorough and explain everything to you without confusion. I loved that I was able to receive text messages with updates on the repair . That’s was super convenient for me as I work full time and can’t always call to check on my car. Finally they finished a few days earlier than the expected date they gave me. My car is like brand new. Everything looked perfect. They even did a car wash for me . The drop off and pick up of the repair was fast and easy. Will definitely recommend to anyone locally or willing to take the drive to Moreno Valley. The outcome will leave you a happy customer just like myself.</text>< response>

I have been hit twice this year unfortunately. Fix Auto was one of my options and I looked at the reviews the first time and decided to give them a try. They did such a good job with my car, and it was done in the time they had said it would. That I chose to get me car taken car by them once more. Their customer service is
Outstanding. Jesse was able to contact Enterprise to arrange for a rental just 40 minutes before my appointment. So when I went to drop off my car, the rental was there. Eli was very helpful and would call with updates on my car. The car was completed earlier than the estimated and it looks good as new. I highly recommend them!!!

<review>Will never ever return to this location. Speed is more important than quality! In & Out. Just very disappointed in the details. I love my car. The accident was not my fault. Then to take my hard earned car into a shotty business just made it worse. My bumper was replaced and painted. Does not match. It's bad when my friends and family tell me it don't look right. But now when I'm washing and detailing my charger I see the differance. My entire car is dark grey not grey. Sucks!< /review><date>1600317665857< /date><Rating>3< /Rating>< user_id>

<Text>Took vehicle to fix auto for repairs resulting from an accident.  When we entered the facility the employees were very welcoming.  Everyone was wearing face masks and following correct protocol for this time.  So happy the insurance company recommended them.  Very professional.  Work was done and completed in timeframe given.  Also, they sent updates each day to let us know what was happening.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone needed repairs on their vehicles.</Text><user>112882837342256609058<//user><time>1598477598217< /time><Response>{'time': 1598894662431, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience!

They did a good job. The area they need to improve on is meeting time you already gave a customer for the completion. If for any reason you cannot meet the time, don't fail to communicate it to the customer about it. You guys do a good job at Fix Auto.<//Review>

<Text>I took my Toyota Tundra in for major side damage, and when I picked it up it looked like a new truck. The estimated time frame was on time. I was really impressed by the work and the paint job, definitely worth it. I would recommend this auto shop, the supervisor will make sure your well taken care during and even after job is done.

They did a great job, finished ahead of schedule and paid great attention to details. They cleaned up the car really nice when they were done which my wife really appreciated.<//review>

<Date>1608586211997<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>First let me start with, we are insured by Geico who is absolutely amazing. Decided to take my mom car here because Caliber Collisions Moval is not on Geicos approved collision centers.

Initially taking her car here was easy, they gave us an ETA and were pleasantly surprised to get a call that the vehicle would be ready a few days early.

I call the next day and they told me they ran into some issues and maybe another couple of days. Okay, no problem. The ETA date came and lapsed. Okay, no problem. Followed up a few days later and I was told they had to order a part that was not originally on the estimate and were having issues getting it approved by our adjuster. I called the adjuster and found out, he had not received a called about additional part request. Alright I’m starting to get irritated. Talked to them again and they told us there an issue with the seatbelts but it looked like it was almost ready. Okay, sweet.

Finally picked up the car, after a few weeks my mom starts to hear a progressive rattle. I called the adjuster and he says, lifetime guarantee, you can take it back and have them look at it. So my mom, nice lady in her 50s takes the car back in and they tell it’s probably some loose water bottles and loose spare in the trunk. Okay, now I’m annoyed.

I called the adjuster and asked if I could take it for a second opinion to Caliber Collisions in Riverside because they are on Geicos approved list. Adjuster agrees, and my mom takes it there with her work order. They DO hear a rattle confirming that my mom isn’t being dramatic but rightfully fearful.

After some digging around they find LOOSE BOLTS to the suspension that caused the car to become unaligned and pretty dangerous (the rattling). They also told her they need to replace one of the mirrors as a part was broken causing air to come into the vehicle.

I can understand things happen, we get busy and maybe things were rushed or whatever. What I cannot deal with is being lied to, if your behind on the work, tell me that, I’ll take that over a lie any day of the week. Or worse being dismissive of my moms (the customer) concerns and attributing the noise to loose items in the trunk.

I’m glad caliber will go ahead and fix these issues but I will not be taking any other future vehicles of mine to this collision center for the aforementioned reasons.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I’ve taken my vehicle here three times because my car is cursed I guess, but each time I have been satisfied with the product and service that I have received. I will should deduct the point because an associate wasn’t wearing a mask the day I was there but that’s not the kind of person I am.  I definitely recommend these guys if you have any body that needs to be done and that’s it.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1597171382689, 'text': 'We appreciate your honest review and your business.

This establishment is not professional at all. I had one employee call me to tell me it was ready for pick up. Then calls me 45 minutes later to say THEY forgot to check one last thing WITH the dealership!!! If the car isn't ready, dont call me to say that it is. They kept blaming the dealership when they were the ones that forgot to check something. I hope I NEVER get to go back there.< /Text>

<text>The experience was very off putting. Their representatives and manager were polite and apologetic but this place seriously dropped the ball. They left unfinished work, and there was a serious lack of communication and professionalism. They never kept me up to date on where the repair process was at they gave me three different pickup dates and kept me in limbo, on the final pickup date they had to ask me for 30 more minutes because the car still wasn’t ready. On top of all that they replaced my front bumper and left my signal lights not screwed on. But the cherry on top was them replacing my condenser for my air conditioning and it not working properly. My car legitimately blows hot air. I get that stuff happens and things sometimes get delayed or don’t go according to plan but you can only take so much as a dissatisfied customer. I would highly suggest anyone needing collision repair take their car somewhere else where they actually have an idea of what’s going on.< /text><Time>1601872324405< /Time>< GmapID>

<user>100559157388778050928</user><Review>They had our car ready early, and it seemed like everything was great. All the body work looked good & our car was given back to us detailed and clean. But then we found out our tire pressure sensor was supposed to be replaced and never was... yet, it was on the invoice as having been charged as if it had been replaced... fortunately Fix It gave us zero hassle about us bringing it in to be replaced. HOWEVER, now I’m questioning what else we’re going to find that was supposed to be fixed but wasn’t. This is work done on a leased vehicle & the lease is up next year. So whatever is there to find, the dealership is going to find it, and I’m definitely not taking responsibility for it. I wanted to have zero issues as the staff were friendly and informative, and the facility seemed reputable. Maybe this was a small oversight that happened as a result of them trying to meet our goal of having the vehicle done 2 days earlier than projected, I don’t know.</Review><name>Amanda Schultz<//name>< pictures>

The wonderful employees at fix it auto moreno valley, are so helpful and warm. I have never been to a car repair shop that not only gives great customer service but treats the customers like royalty. Marco was my technician and fix my vehicle it was like my car look like I was never in a accident. I recommend anyone to go their for your car repair needs and not only to mention, the wonderful front desk lady was very friendly and helpful. Wonderful, wonderful place 5 star service.</review>

<review>My experience was great. They communicated throughout the entire process letting me know what was left to fix. My car was even fixed and painted before the anticipated date. Thank you for making the whole process easy going.<//review>< Rating>

After my hit and run my insurance recommended this auto shop and I took it. Knowing that it was close to family took the first appointment they had. They were great from the moment I made the appointment, very professional, and very helpful. They made sure to send me updates of my car every step of the way, that was very helpful. Couldn’t have asked for better service. They gave me an estimated done date and they made sure to keep it around that time frame. Honestly I would highly recommend this shop to friends and family. Couldn’t have asked for better service! 👌🏽🙌🏽</text>

<review>I’ve been here three times and every time I  asked my insurance adjuster to set me up with Fix Auto MoVal. Theyre so kind and so helpful. I always appreciate that they go into detail about the process and provide timelines. Every time they come through when I leave my baby with them. Awesome place with awesome people. :)</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dca5ddca0b1b5b:0xebe14e553384a835</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Definitely did a horrible job on my wifes 2014 Honda accord sport. They try to get you  in and out fast before you notice anything is wrong with the car. When you notice something wrong, they try to say it was like that before. Really disappointed in this place. They did good work in the past. I can't understand what happened. Maybe its because we paid cash and didn't go through the insurance company. BIG MISTAKE!!! Update, I took the car next door to All Magic paint and body and they did a great job. Way better customer service.</text>

It was a pleasure working with Fix Auto Moreno Valley. After making my claim with my insurance company, Fix Auto called me the very next day and started the process in repairing my vehicle. I dropped off the vehicle on a Thursday and it was ready the following Thursday. They also texted me everyday to advise they were on track to finish my vehicle on time. Great service.<//review>

<text>Not impressed on how my belongings were thrown inside my car plus the greasy trunk seal and trunk liner. My car is 2 months old and should have been taken better of. When I picked up my car I had to ask the gentlemen to show me my car.  He just stood there, I had to ask again can you show me what you did? The girl at the desk asked me to sign papers that my car was done before I even saw the car. Very unprofessional.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>FIX Auto is Horrible. I was told I would get my car on Thursday, that didn't happen. I got a call late Thursday that my car would be ready by 11am Friday, to expect a call so I can pick it up. Its Saturday and still no Phone call. These guys have no clue how to run a Customer Based Business. lack of follow thru, poor communication skills. DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE!!!!  Better repair shops in Moreno Valley to go to.<//Review>< Pics>

This shop did damage to my vehicle which the manager fixed after I brought it to his attention. If I had said nothing they would have let me go home with a vehicle they did more damage to when they were supposed to fix it. You cannot trust the shop with your vehicle.< /Text>

<Review>ridiculously unprofessional... second time dropping off my car there because they did not fix it right the first time and they left it with a lot of geese stains..... well second time around they left it even worse.... my car is so sticky and was left so dirty..... and the problems on the car are still the same... they won’t even call you to tell you your car is ready.... I had to call them because they took a month instead of the agreed 2 weeks....<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I chose this body shop to handle all the damages  to my vehicle since my car accident. The car was dropped off on 3rd, and inspection was done on the 5th the damages were assessed. Upon the 9th I received a call from Laura (employee of fix auto)  she told me the extent of my damages ,how much it was going to cost ,and when my car would be complete (20th and the very latest it should be finished early). Every time I call to get an update on my car Laura is busy so I'll leave a message. it'll take her four days to return my phone call. Its finally the 20th so I called them (I actually got a old of her)  what do you know Laura hasn't done her inspection on my car so  even though my car is complete now it's just sitting at their shop you know waiting for this chick to do her inspection.  All in all I would not recommend taking your car here. they lie to you about the expectation of when it's going to be complete.  Secretaries are great at answering the phone but nobody else will talk to you they're all busy with clients.  Not really sure how many messages you need to leave before the call you back in the same day.</Text>

Luckily, the professionals at Fix auto took care of me on all three occasions. I am particular about my vehicles and they came out looking brand new every time. The owner even did some extra cosmetic work on my Infiniti at no cost.

They took twice as long to fix my car as stated when I dropped it off . Then they didn't notify me until the day it was supposed to be ready to tell me it would be another week. Very very disappointed and will no longer give them my business.< /Review>

Nice experiences. This was over 3 weekly visits due to my issues with parts and making the car drive-able. They were consistently friendly. They clearly and accurately described the service ahead of time. They mounted and balanced 2 new tires I provided and did an alignment. They went beyond expectations rechecking one of the tire mounts discovering and replacing a bad gasket on a new sensor valve stem I provided. This at no additional charge. All this and their prices are the most reasonable I could find. I will be back when I need service in the future.<//text>

Car overheating no idea why .  DNA found that my water pump was the culprit . I was helped by two different guys. Said they would do a pressure test first .  They even let me watch my soap opera while  I waited .    Haha . They quoted me for exactly what I needed and got to work .  Marco mentioned I should look into some new tires  soon and gave me a quote . Fair price , I will defiantly come  back for new tires .  Over all my car was fixed in 4 hours .  No more over heating .  3 of my friends recommending DNA .  I’ve joined the club . If your car or truck needs  repair ,  maintenance ,   service inspection, or tires,  you’ll get honest  work from a great company .</text>

I had a pre-purchase inspection done here and it was worth every penny and time. They were all super professional and patient with me and took their time explaining everything. The waiting area was clean and comfortable and they offered coffee and water and tv. Honest staff and nice!< /review>

We were fortunate to be around DNA Automotive and for Marco and his crew to be available on a Saturday afternoon.

The engine light of our Mini Cooper came on while we were driving out of SF (we drove from NY). Marco discovered that the Mini's spark plugs were stuck in the well, and pulling it out risked damaging the engine.

Marco ( akin to a doctor due to his Hippocratic approach to car repairs) was open and honest with providing us suggestions and options of how he would like for us to make repairs to his car (and letting us know of the pros and cons). In my experience, other shops will try to do the job without ever informing you of the consequences because they will mark up/upsell the job, but not Marco.

If you ever run into car trouble and happen to be around DNA, I highly suggest you seek our Marco and the good folks at DNA Automotive.

Two days later, Marco followed up with us to see how was the car. This is a stand-up guy.<//text>

What can I say except this place is exceptional! Extremely professional, informative, patient and reasonable. My direct contact was Antonio and he was great, courteous, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable, you couldn't ask for a better experience when needing a car repair.< /review>

<Review>WHY DNA AUTOMOTIVE IS SO SPECTACULAR!
In 2017, I bought a 2003 Toyota Sienna and brought it to the team at DNA, which treated this old, somewhat forlorn beauty with vast knowledge, mixed with dashes of magic. Their restorative powers were dazzling. Never has an old car had such keen attention bestowed upon it. Over the last three years I brought it in for a few repairs and everything was always done so flawlessly. Just a day ago I took it in for an oil change and inspection and left not only with beautifully clean oil, but also with cleaned and adjusted rear brake shoes, plus an adjustment of the emergency brake, and the car suddenly feels like a spanking new one. It drives so gorgeously that I can't believe it's 17 years old, and that's because of the extraordinary abilities of these car repair magicians. They also took the time to adjust the rear seat belts at no charge that had become entangled. Speaking of charges, you will not find more reasonable rates anywhere, nor more convivial service. Donny, Antonio, and Marco are three of the most impressive and terrific fellows one could meet. Get your car to DNA! You'll be thrilled with the outcome.</Review><GmapID>0x80859a196db13237:0x1788b3ca0942d409< /GmapID><user>103025918150918213286<//user><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Took the time to walk me through the process of tire selection with good suggestions and explained various cost for warranty service work.  Good pricing that is competitive with everyone.

But I had come in the week prior and no offer for warranty repair. Curious and asking around about the tune up cost I learned that this shop charged very high.. this is my experience and it has not been positive with this shop.  It looks as though others have had much better results.  I do not  know if their work on my car caused future problems but will now have to pay again to have what I believe should have been a good business decision on their part to at least repair or commit to repairing while reducing the cost of what I am now having to face for what may be related to the work that was done just one year ago.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80859a196db13237:0x1788b3ca0942d409</Gmap_id></record>

The first time I brought in my car, that had been damaged on the hood, they gave great service and pricing. A second time I came in for an oil change, they found that a brake sensor cable was grazing against the tire, something the dealer missed and could have affected my ability to stop the car.

I have been going back to them many times and saved time and gotten better service than the dealership.

Thanks DNA!!!<//Review>

I ordered 4 tires from Tire Rack and had them shipped here. They were over $100 cheaper to get installed here then other shops listed on Tire Rack! I dropped my car off in the evening and picked it up the next morning. Great service, zero issues, AMAZING prices! Will tell my friends.

Yet another outstanding experience at DNA Automotive.  We now take all three of our cars there for service and body work.  They continue to be thorough, responsible, trustworthy and provide excellent results at a great value.  They go out of their way to ensure everything is explained in detail, and never, ever encourage work if not required for safety or long term benefit to the vehicle.  They are courteous, and their shop and waiting area is always clean.  I continue to be both impressed and grateful to have found them, and would recommend them for any vehicle - old or new.</text>

I made an appointment to get my throwout bearing replaced on my 2017 mustang gt just 4 days before and they were really helpful and they had my car done the same day had my clutch upgraded to a stage 3 they did a better job than the dealer. The first time I had this problem the dealer had my car for almost 2 weeks before they worked on my car and they broke the covers around my shifter and left car grease all over the interior. DNA took really good care of me, their really clean highly recommended.<//text>

I'm always happy to have DNA as my car mechanic, I've been with them for almost a year and didn't have any issue with them.

Antonio and Donny are always friendly, always smiling and treating their customers very well, they are also professionals, and honest.

This week for example I took my car to change the oil, and they said I didn't have to, but I had to check the break, so they did what they had to do, other mechanics will change the oil without necessity, plus will fix the break just to get more money, and DNA was totally honest with me just doing what they had to do so far, this honesty and professional ethic I will always value this.

I highly recommend this place!!!<//review>

The guys at DNA delivered again! Both Antonio and Donny are very knowledgeable and make major problems seem easy. I trust them completely to provide a fair estimate and to get the work done on time, for the price that was estimated. I have brought my car over for mechanical repairs quite a few times and I have never had a problem with their service. I constantly refer friends because I trust them fully. I also heard DNA now provides body work too. I hope I won't need it, but I'd certainly recommend people to get an estimate there. Anyways, I'm very happy with DNA and I will definitely continue bringing my car and my motorcycle over.</text>

<text>My Kia needed front brake pads replaced and a turn signal bulb replaced--both safety issues. DNA Automotive was able to get me in right away on Saturday with short notice. They identified some other work that needed to be done: a headlight bulb had gone out that I didn't notice, and the oil and filter needed to be changed. Marco and Antonio were both thorough and very easy to work with.

They did identify additional work that would need to be done over the next few months, but they were not aggressive in pushing me to get it done now. They also explained the implications of delaying doing the work so that I could make a choice of what to do now and what to do when I had more time.

DNA's prices are very reasonable. The additional work was quoted at a very competitive price. I had called around for other estimates and DNA's estimate for the original work was less than the others. The final price held to their estimate. No surprises. They kept me informed about the progress, and completion was very close to what they estimated.

I highly recommend you check them out if you need work repair work done on your car.

15 October: Just went back for a second service and am pleased to doubly confirm my previous review :)!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1563924301469, 'text': 'We were happy to help out, Don!

The guys at DNA are fantastic. I found them refreshingly honest, and above and beyond helpful. Donny showed me how to change my air filters, check my fluids, and gave me recommendations for quality tires and a quality battery when I'm ready to trade my old stuff out. He helped me prioritize maintenance on my car - what needs to be done now vs. what I should do soon. I'll definitely be back the next time I need car repairs and/or maintenance!< /text>

<Review>I first came in to check up on my Check engine light and before they used a single tool they suspected my breaks were the main issue.

Their staff is very knowledgeable with cars of all kinds and they also do body paint which while an expensive feature is something some are looking for.

They are a great place to check out if you want to have a team of regulars looking at your car.< /Review>< Pics>

From the moment I walked into the clean, pleasant waiting room, it was a great experience. I was greeted amiably by Donny and Antonio, the two owners.   The car had sustained front end damage while parked which  crumpled up the left front.

Their Operations Manager, Will Banuelos,  took care of the whole process, the crazy insurance issues and the estimate.  He directed the technicians.  He arranged for a rental car and transportation to the rental office.  They started work on the car immediately.  I depend totally on this little car and was concerned for how long this might take.  Within a couple of days, Will called to say that the car was ready.  It looks like a new car!!!  I noticed they had even cleaned the interior to leave it customer-ready.

This business takes pride in their customer service -- and with good reason. Fast, clean and professional.  Contact Will Banuelos .  With his 38  years of experience in the field, you can stop worrying.  You and your vehicle are in good hands.!!!!<//text>

They had me turn off my car to test the battery - they found it dead (which was pretty obvious from the fact that my car wouldn't start without a jump) and then said "your battery is dead and we can't jump you". Umm, okay .. thanks a lot Napa. So they then told me I had to install the replacement battery myself - I have no tools - they kindly offered to sell me tools - how nice of them. I walked next door to DNA and explained this to the manager and he was like "no problem, we'll help you out" and they sent Domingo out with tools and a device that even kept the radio in power when they took the battery out. They did all of this entirely free of charge. I am not at all surprised to see that this is a 5 star shop - I just found my new mechanics (even though I like my current mechanic). Thank you DNA!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This business is awesome! Robert and Mr Dominguez are super friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and work carefully! I needed a regulator for my 4Runner and they did an awesome job! Thank you! Will return for future service. Also the job was not expensive so great deal too!</Text>

<review>The food makes my day every day I have the privilege of eating it. Everything is delicious and seriously spicy. My only gripe is that sometimes I think they don't trust me when I say I want it SPICY. The days they trust me and don't hold back, I could not be happier. I look for Thai / Lao food everywhere I go - this place is easily among my favorites.<//review>< Pictures>

Like Self Service.
The guy take your order very slow.
They use togo utensils 🍴 When you eat finish can trow away in trash can.

-1 star for service but food 🥘 so delicious.

Their garlic prawns is what keeps me coming back! Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines and I've been to a lot of other Thai places in the city. This spot is one of the few that have it on the menu and that does it well every time. Just do it< /review>

If you're in the mood for some of the best Asian cuisine, you've chosen the right spot! Love mama serves I believe Vietnamese, Malaysian and Thai food. Usually I'm skeptical about places that serve multiple ethnicities, however this restaurant does a great job of keeping consistent flavors and keeping each dish true to its nationality of origin.< /Review>

I celebrated my PhD yesterday in this great restaurant. Well we enjoyed a wonderful evening and the restaurant was surely the reason for this fruitful gathering. The waiters  collaborated in a very nice manner, the cooking was extremely good and my guests were so  joyful. We shall surely return for more joyful events. thanks very much.</Review>

THAILAND 🇹🇭
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
Inside of La Fiesta Swap Meet, make your way past clothing, hat, and shoe vendors, past sleepy workers watching movies on their phones, walls full of veladoras, and the many barbers and salons in La Fiesta to sit down for a spicy feast. "Kan Tong" is the name of the original owner of the stall, who went by the nickname Kim. No matter what language you prefer, an exciting meal is on the way.

This meal started with a delicious plate of naem khao tod ($10), which immediately went to the top of the power rankings with the one at Vientiane down in Garden Grove. In addition to the rice cooked with curry paste and sour sausage, they include peanuts and roasted chili peppers. Freshly chopped up ginger seemingly pervades each and every bite in such a good way.</Review>

For an avid papaya salad lover like myself, I was only able to take few bites of the 2 different styles offered here. The style was right but it was just missing a lot of that extra punch that should have been there but wasn't. Not worth traveling far for.<//Review><username>Mahiru< /username><gmapID>0x80c2969221d5f8fd:0xcdb004d23c168333< /gmapID>< resp>

The Pho has a more savory broth that most pho places, the pork larb was my favorite I've had, and the papaya salad was just the way I like it.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2969221d5f8fd:0xcdb004d23c168333<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Like the clothes grocery department selling vegan food and organic eggs.
Yashika was at great help at the pick up online orders.  I give her eight fingers and two thumbs up.< /Review>

<Review>I went in there Mad as heck because I didn't get a notification for the card stock. I basically went in there and acted like a male Karen. The manager George explained the situation and calm me down. Well I didn't get the cards this week but that's okay cuz George told me he's going to try his best this week to get it to work properly. The manager sure does know how to deescalate a situation and I give him props for that. Went in there Mad as heck left with a smile in my face.

Target have some very good brands and the size ranges are incredible. The employees at the Merced Target are friendly and greets me every time I go in. I go there so much I feel like we're family now haha. The checkout line is quick and they make sure the area is sanitize or clean first before they ring up the next customer. This also applies to self check out.< /text>

Very clean and well organized store with perfect lighting. I always prefer Target over Walmart for those reasons along with the fact that their employees tend to be far more friendly and helpful. Love that there is a Starbucks inside and it accepts the Target Credit Card.</text>

<review>I was in the area so I stopped in to purchase a couple of things. While I was visiting the book section, I noticed there was an elf on a shelf for purchase for $7.99. I tried to pay for my items in electronics and was successful other than the elf on a shelf. The cashier told me I had to take the Elf on the Shelf to the front desk to make the purchase so a manager could override it because it was four days before the legal release date. I took the elf on a shelf to the customer service department and a blue haired manager came over and told me she could not sell it to me. I left the store an unhappy customer. I frequent most Target stores in the areas where I live and travel to, but I will not be back to this one.<//review>< pictures>

The store was super clean, bright, and cheerful.  The air conditioning worked great also.  I actually thought to myself while walking through the store how impressively clean it was.<//review>

<Text>Target optical has a very rude manager working in the optical store. She says things to people that are odd and purposely insulting. She's very sick with the need to control people by being manipulative, mean and nasty. Corporate needs to evaluate her behavior without her knowing they're watching her. People like her are the reason customer service doesn't exist. Obviously she needs some help.</Text><Name>Jem Harper</Name>< time>

Today I visited glad to know everyone is required to wear masks. I finally felt safe going shopping. I saw at least 30% of shoppers without masks and no one enforcing the governors law requiring all indoor shoppers are required by law to masks. I t am 69 years old. I will no longer be shopping at target. It really disappointed me to see so many people ignoring the sign in the window requiring everyone to wear masks. I’ll find a store that enforces the governors declaration.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>I did not shop here much before, but now that they have their drive-up to pick up your order available on their app, its practically my go to place now. There is no minimum cost requirement and you can order just about anything that they have in store. Though there is a 2 hour wait before you can drive up most times, they do message you when its ready.<//text><rating>5<//rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Store is amazing, I shop here daily. Unfortunately the morning of Sunday 6/23/2019 whatever male Starbucks attendant that was working at 10 am not only had the person in front of me waiting for 15 minutes  (he told me) I myself waited 30 minutes. We heard his entire conversation with a fellow worker (she was on her break she was not at fault) about how he doesn’t care and if it’s time for him to leave he will leave. All standing in line we’re wondering why we knew this entire story yet we hadn’t been helped or even acknowledged in over 30 minutes.  I go to this Starbucks DAILY so understand that there is sometimes a wait however the manager and the girls that are always working there are amazing. Even if it’s a little bit of a wait, they’re always rushing to get the next person helped and apologizing for the wait. This male didn’t have a name tag on so I couldn’t even get a name. I was charged double for my drink and then argued with once I asked why. I was told to wait and made fun of once I asked to speak to a manger. I will returning to speak to the manager as I stop at this location every day. I was also late for work and still have no drink in my hand. I haven’t written in a review in I don’t know how long but I could not let someone like this represent this location as I am extremely familiar with the people who are always there. It’s not fair to them or the company.< /Review>

Target doesn't treat their customers like thieves, checking their bags and receipts before they leave the store. Target also will give the item sold for the price listed, even if it is a mistake. Target is clean, not cramming as much as possible in every space which makes it harder to maneuver carts. Ross, Dress for Less and Walmart treat their customers horribly, but not Target. Thank you for treating your customers with dignity.</review>

Great place to chill at especially since they added the Starbucks area! Cashiers are polite to the customers. The people working with the tech in the back of the store are also very helpful. Turns out many locals don’t put positive reviews on places. Why not? Idk but they should review more places because they would have better reviews. I’ve noticed it’s mainly visitors who review that don’t even live in the Merced County.<//review>

Went to Taget Store with my husband, May  2020 to buy a swimming pool for the kids. There was a long waiting line which I didn't mind (btw we have face mask and glove). But the worker told me and my husband that we couldn't go in because there was a one adult " TO GO INSIDE " store policy and if we do go in, they will have people to monitor us. So I opt out to stay in the car because I respect their policy, if it is true.

Afterward my husband came back and he told me that there were SO many adults people shopping together and nothing happen to them. Idk neither they pick on us because my husband is dark complexion or because we are both Asian and look young.  Anti-asian during covid19.

Enforce your policy equally please. Will NOT shop there anymore.

Btw we purchased our swimming pool the same dayat BIG 5, which had better customer service.<//review>

I always shop at Merced Target because it's one of my favorite stores. All these years I've never had bad customer service, until 7/14/19. The cashier I got (didn't get her name because I didn't even want to look at her), was not nice and made some rude comments towards me. Never had this problem, really wish I should've spoke to a manager right away but I was just upset. Next time I go, I'm definitely getting her name.<//Review>

<Review>1 or 2 cashiers only! They want you to use self checkouts now. Lines are way too long. Why have 10+registers and only use 2??? Making us not only do the work for free, but to wait in long lines. I will be doing online shopping from now on.< /Review><GmapID>0x8091424a61acf81b:0x5962a3f4cab55f77< /GmapID>< username>

Good store to shop at for your personal needs. They have just remodeled the interior of the store for those who needs to return merchandise. They do have a Starbucks inside of this location. The convenience of four self checkout lanes plus the revamped customer service desk should help the shoppers.

I am a regular Target shopper and get what I need from the store. It varies from bar soap to groceries. Even electronics for a $11 keyboard. The prices are competitive with Walmart and other outlets.

I do recommend Merced Target as a place for shoppers. Check out what the re-modded store looks like.</text>

<Text>I purchased an item online with Amazon by an independent seller but the item came from Target. The item was defective. The packing receipt says i can return it in store so i tried inwuiring at the local Target store. At first they said it cannot be because they are competitors with Amazon but after they saw the item, the readily approved the "returning". Thanks Target, my first contact with them, awesome....</Text>< user_id>

<Text>Last night; my husband and I were on register 4 and the cashier Evangelica ( I believe that’s her name ) did not greet us with courtesy like how She was with the customer ahead of us. And that me feel unwelcome; I’ve shopped at target before and none of the cashier employees did not made me feel unwelcome at all.< /Text>< pictures>

<Date>1567745123647</Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>Purchased baby nursery water a day or two ago and noticed that the cap was slashed, meaning the nursery water was exposed. Staff that handled baby items need to be more gentle on opening boxes with a razor blade or box cutter. Like any human being, we are at fault for disregarding details and or not paying close enough attention to details. Therefore we recieve defective products.  Called the store to notify staff however all nursery waters were already sold. It is heartbreaking as a mother who tirelessly have a baby to care for and is too mentally fatigue to sucessfully "assume" that she will recieve a good product turned bad. I spoke to Baby department manager Robert and with his acknowledgment, I hope efforts will be made to enforce more effective training on staff so a situation like this would be prevented from happening again.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
It’s sad that it’s true it’s the only best place to shop in Merced. I guess that says a lot about the town. Reason for the 3 stars is that it was dirty. The woman’s restrooms floor was covered with toilet paper and napkins everywhere. Throughout the store there was garbage. I have never seen a Target this dirty. I shop at Target for the experience. We all know they are pricey. But wow this Target is gross! I will take my business to Target on Herndon Ave in Fresno. I rather drive a few more miles then come here again.  Our cashier was nice! Reason why I am giving it a 3 star. Wish I wrote her name down.< /Review>

Be very careful as someone might come in on you if the doors are not locked. When it comes to Gender Neutral Restrooms, they can be for any gender as well. I am not sure if they can be for any gender, but if you want to feel safe and private when using the restroom, then the Gender Neutral Restrooms are for you. Just make sure to use caution as someone might come in on you as well as making sure to report a problem to security if you are in danger.< /text>< rating>

The Isles are nice and large enough where customers have lots of space without bumping into one another… theirs so much more I could say. Target has got its s**t together than any other I've  seen and Awesomely CLEAN!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I purchased a personal fan a couple days ago. It wasn't as powerful as I thought. (To keep me cool) So I took it back for a refund. The clerk looked at my receipt punched in some numbers and "BAM" she handed me a Target card (store credit) for the amount of the fan. Fast, friendly and I didn't have to explain why I was returning it! GREAT!< /Review>< user_id>

If I could give this place no Stars I would! It's disgusting! I went to use the bathroom and it was so gross I decided to hold it!! I would have rather gone outside. The entrance had trash eveywhere! One cashier on and one person working at the Starbucks it was the worst Target I have ever been too! my Husband and I left in a hurry and went to another store and a solo Starbucks!< /review>

<text>I'VE HAD A  BAD EXPERIENCE AT THE TARGET IN MERCED, CA. I WOULD RATHER DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD TO ATWATER TO GO TO TARGET FROM NOW ON. AS MUCH MONEY AS I SPEND IN THERE...ABOUT EVERY TWO DAYS I SPEND MONEY FOR MY HOUSEHOLD. I WAS TREATED BADLY BY THE PERSON THAT TELLS YOU WHAT LINE TO GO TO. WELL I HAD AN INCIDENT WITH ANOTHER CUSTOMER WHO CUT ME AS I WAS IN THAT OTHER LINE THAT THE WORKER TOLD ME TO GO TO. BUT MY ISSUE IS JUST NOT WITH THE CUSTOMER BUT THE WORKER WAS TOO BUSY TO LISTEN TO MY COMPLAINT BUT THIS OTHER CUSTOMER WHICH IN MY BOOK THAT MAKES FOR BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE. I AM A BUSINESS OWNER AS WELL SO I KNOW PART OF BUSINESS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. TARGET DOES NOT HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE! THEY USED TO UNTIL THEY HAVE HIRED THESE RUDE WORKERS THERE. SO I WILL EITHER PURCHASE EVERYTHING ONLINE FROM AMAZON OR WALMART. I WILL NO LONGER SHOP AT A TARGET UNLESS SOMEONE CAN GET BACK TO ME AND MAKE UP FOR THE BAD EXPERIENCE.</text>< gmapID>

<Review>Ridiculous policy when trying to exchange a $10 for a roll of quarters when making a purchase. They can only exchange $3 max. Asked about 4 exchanges (1-$1 and 3-$3). Was told no and that they don't sell quarters because they need it for their business.

Paying customer trying to make a 1:1 exchange of currency is not a sale and loses future business.<//Review><Time>1580813395479</Time></record></dataset><record>

Won't visit here again. Shrimp was so overcooked it was like a rubber bouncy ball. The chop suey was bland. The egg flavor soup was tasteless. Prices are high for the quality of food.< /text>

Traditional American Chinese style options.  But they are not over sauced or greasy.  Small but clean restaurant. Very reasonable prices. Even my picky family liked it.</review>

Good prices and good food, like their chowmain and orange chicken. The 1 thing I don't like is they charge 50 cents if you don't buy $10 worth or more worth of food</Text>

Second time going there..first time the food was salty and dry looked old. But I taught ok maybe we went when they had a bad cook. Bad time.. Let's try again but no, The food was no good again. The teriyaki chicken was so salty you couldn't eat it. The orange chicken tasted old and hard. The Green beans were mixed old and new ones..We will never go there again. Waisted money.< /Review>

<text>My boyfriend and I frequently go here and we love it! The food is always fresh, and the staff is so friendly! They recently remodeled inside and tinted their windows and the place looks great! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for fast fresh and delicious Chinese food.</text>< rating>

<text>Did not like the place at all! Moved recently from another part of Rancho Cucamonga. So, my family and I always went to this other Chinese food place. However, since we moved it's too far. We decided to try this place, because we always seen people in there. Thought, "well, it must be good." Not!!! I wish I had reviewed the reviews earlier. This place is not good, no flavor, cold. Store-bought Chinese food taste better!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I went here almost twice a week, and I ordered the same thing. Each time I was charged a different amount, sometimes a dollar more, this past time $1.75 more which isn’t much, but if you overcharge every person, it adds up. The first couple of times I didn’t notice, the last two times were noticeable.</text>

Ok this place is the best Chinese food around. BBQ pork with white noodle with a little teriaki. The spicy wanton bowl is awesome if you like it hot. Always fresh.< /Text>

< Review>
Must be under new mgmnt.  Fried shrimp appetizer thick tasteless breading and when opened we're not cleaned shrimp.  Proportionatly off to the size of the shrimp  which was very dry as well.  Not good. Boiling War wonton soup put into paper cup type containters needed salt/seasoning but needed styrofoam insulation..  They forgot the complimentary fortune cookie.  Something has changed.<//Review>

<Text>Chaotic. Waited 15 minutes for my order which was supposedly ready per the app. The 2 customers ahead of me each waited alone in the lobby per the sign on the door. 1 person in lobby. Upon my turn I  entered the lobby alone and was asked to go back outside with the other 2 customers in line. Moments later some guy rolls up and walks right past us into the lobby where he was greeted and not told to wait outside. I will no longer be a Dominos customer. This is unacceptable. I would give zero stars if I could.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>This is the worst dominos location around. The sad thing is dominos is usually delicious. Every single time I place an order at this location, it is wrong. If I order extra cheese they barely put any cheese on it, and put way too much sauce on it to where it’s not edible. If I order more than one pizza they mix up the toppings. I would understand if it happened once but it has happened the last 3 times I have ordered from here. I really hope there is a change in management because when the pizzas are made how I order them, it is delicious.<//Review><user_id>106993632841716874539< /user_id>< GmapID>

<review>Usually I would give 5 stars, but the last 2 orders the pizza was luke warm. We always pick up the pizza ourselves. They are very hot when it arrives home. It is almost like they make a cheese pizza ahead of time, then add the other toppings and reheat when someone orders. That's my guess. Will give them another try.</review></record>

<Text>Do not waste your tome and money. I was told 25-30 minutes my pizza will be ready for pick up. After arriving 25 minutes later I have now been waiting one hour in here. Do not believe what they tell you, it will take twice as long plus they were in a rush and put absolutely no toppings! Should have went to papa Johns.<//Text>< username>

I do not know why Domino's Pizza is on this list I must have been sitting out front of it doing something else probably eating a better Pizza. I'd recommend you go to Papa John's or even Little Caesars.although since I didn't actually eat here don't take these words to heart and try for yourself but buyer beware you are eating at Domino's<//review>

What would we do without Domino's? Especially now during the last 2 months that we are in a remodel, Domino's is  a God sent. Tastes great and affordable.</text>

<text>I called the store, someone picked up momentarily then placed me on hold without saying anything.  I was on hold for over 15+ mins until I hanged up out of frustration.  At first I thought it must've been a fluke/mistake so I called again... Only for someone to pick up momentarily, not say anything, then place me on hold until I hanged up.  I tried one more time... got placed on hold again.

I thought maybe it was my phone so I called another dominos ...  Within seconds.. "thank you for calling dominos..."

Needless to say, I'm disappointed.  =(</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>Erik my delivery driver was here before I could double check my app. So of course, very punctual, very polite, and even shook my hand before heading back. My pizza and wings are cooked perfectly to my order. Thank you Domino's........excuse me, I need to eat😀🍕🍕🍕🍗🍗🍗</review>< Response>

<Review>Fair is fair, and although we've had issues at this store in the past, tonight's dinner emergency forced us to try this store again and for a change everything was just as ordered. They have not as yet gotten their pricing to match their coupons yet, but at least things are getting closer than before..

Both pie's were just as ordered, hot and tasty, not to mention delivered on time if not sooner. Maybe they listened after all, the last time we talked about the service and the quality, things did not get fixed. One can only hope.</Review>< pictures>

Ordering online is great! Picking up your order, however, not so much. I go in to pick up my order and there is one person standing at the counter on the phone. Taking someones order, I'm sure. So I stand and wait. A few more customers come in while I'm waiting to be helped. Another Domino's employee comes to the counter and asks the people for their order ignoring the fact I've been standing there for 5 min while the employee in front of me has been on the phone. The employee on the phone has not said one word to me. No, "we'll be right with you." The new costumer humbles them self and picks up their order. I don't say anything (being a polite person) thinking the "phone employee" will say, "this customer was here first" before the next customer is helped. Nope! The employee starts asking the next person what they can help them with. So I stick my hand up and say "excuse me but, I've been standing here." The employee gives me a "I don't believe you look" and takes my order. Very poor customer service.< /text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>I ALWAYS Love the Speed and Quality of the Food as well as the Phone operators and Drivers. It's NORMALLY PERFECT However,  this Time the ranch dressing was missing and the chicken was Overcooked and had NO BBQ Sauce on it, the pizza and cinasticks were good though. I normally would give this a five star rating except the Fact that A TIP IS CHARGED AS PART OF  THE DELIVERY, when how could I rate what tip to give FOR THE SERVICE, when I don't know how well my service is going to be? Also the DRIVERS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE DELIVERY FEE AT LEAST. Thank you.
That is the WHOLE POINT of a tip!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I have never once had an issue with this location of Domino's. One time I had to wait a little longer than normal, but that was one out of like 20 times I've used the online ordering system. Their online ordering system is awesome!!!

Highly Recommended.</Review>

The store on Stearns in Simi Valley is the BEST. The employees there are always friendly and kind. We order from there an awful lot. Probably more than we should but we love your pizza as well as the wings. Thanks to all at the Stearns store.</Review>

Dominos is awesome, but to order here and get everything you pay for on your pizza is something shy of a miracle. Literally every time I order here my pizza is missing a topping or two and almost always is the wrong pizza style. (Thin crust when order says Brooklyn etc) and I've had several times where they overcharge for dips or don't give change when they're supposed to. I usually don't mention it because they're nice there and 50c doesn't matter but every time, without fail, the order is wrong.

The only good thing here is the delivery times are usually good and they're good about keeping the food hot for delivery. But because orders are always wrong I've started going to pick-up, and even today had to walk back in to have them add the topping I paid extra for.< /text>

I'm only giving two stars because the delivery boy (Mauro) was so rude to me after he found out I couldn't tip. It's unnaceptable. Maybe if your delivery boy was smarter with his money, he wouldn't give me an attitude for not tipping him. I'm sorry but Do you live off of tips? No. You live off your salary. Tips are just an extra bonus and it's completely unacceptable when I get attitude for not tipping. But the food was great thanks to Juan, who I'd rather tip than the dumb delivery boy.< /Review>

I usually don't waste my time writing reviews, but I felt I had to do it for this one. That's how bad it was. I ordered 3 Stuffed Cheesy Breads for 3 very hungry boys...it was all dough and very little cheese...they forgot the cheese!! It was also very dry...um, no cheese! It was very disappointing. The person who answered the phone was not too friendly either. That should have been my clue as to not order from them.  Oh, well, I won't be ordering from that Domino's again. The one on L.A.Ave is so much better!< /Review>

The experience this time though was bad and we won't be ordering here again. Instructions on order said to ring doorbell but the delivery person knocked, never ringing the bell. Luckily my husband had just come in from walking the dog so heard him. Not a big deal but would be better if they listened to customer requests a little closer.  The food though is was what got us. The pizza was just gross. The  jalapeños tasted old, and it was greasy, in an unappetizing way. The boneless chicken was cold and chewy and the cheesey bread was overcooked and didn't have any marinara sauce. We called to ask about the sauce and we're told they only give marinara for breadsticks, which I've never heard, there's always been one in the box and if we wanted another we would pay. Not this time though and the manager Brisna made no apologies or attempts to make it right.</text>< Pics>

<text>Definitely will go back, great service and they gave me some jelly, lychee dessert and CARROT cake! The Pho on the other hand... maybe it because it was to go but it wasn't as delicious as sitting and eating it while boiling hot with all the extra goodies they give you (herbs, lime, bean sprouts, etc)<//text><time>1608614846915< /time><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo5F5Bd_rhDjNz3AwXlys9i8MHpP-tcwxDTtCc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-JICSN_0zszTO7h7PTAJG2jTZlhkqV10SVcH3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiFJYxrZnC_7yaqFn4r_CHAu2BmhOmwpgWUmPT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm2IAEL5i5MFmLdjF67jYXeYdAfBy9afGrAJyf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4EocgqW4vHLpryQL_OopYjQpQs8Rhg6dAVpDc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< username>

Just visited here since we are new in the area and were exploring. Food is okay but service was great! Lady server made sure to always check on us if we needed anything else. Will be returning again with the family when we get to go downtown Hollister.<//Text>

<review>Perfectly delicious.  Clean healthy food.  20 minute lead time for pickup.
-Eggs rolls, crispy delicious very meaty not cabbage filler.
-Beef pho was a luscious broth topped with the right fixings.
The neum neong was pork, shredded carrots, shreds of romaine on rice noodle salad.  Light, bright, fresh and tasty.
-Pork and onions stir fry was delicious and filling.

All generous delicious portions prepared with pride that can be tasted.

Also bubble tea.  The taro was purple sweet fun.

Nice patio with mural.  Good vibes.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0PYXqz61Kveqtc_ZyIedGo3Dvu7R7Bj8TWaH0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtY9w8DpBp38fMgI8JXfGv1awSLc8GtJ1Eus9i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM81u-W7ApVMQi72TpoKDx-np27__PTtTdHwO7R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-ci1YsEidF7sEg-qMLubJv0syaHYu2zLfTMP0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR-0cdjTW7scUXcWsOd-sVSwoecpDA3NBGAiyz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQZcXF3U_cADsR5TU84QwnMoeggGOhvJcXJX0W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsF1H2hrQ2Kmi0LO48-8J3eZutJ7fudGlAmwdJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIy3L296VhwDvWcZbDhtn_VO15vwCU5q5r2uPz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOycspS4OlKbDxL3ccvHGrWM_UlKyGWTRR_OtIL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6eJ8aGZz0cqS4ItqiGl5h0C4p096NsliE_haY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMIloI5J6rsCuhTykdWR_NlyGbf-RetUFp8fz6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7fo8S4yttsUqx6dWWGgJNHxDCRE1ibxHb328Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcoqkLKCkNUtl43GrFY9oNEH5QXxxRUrJkdlBJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc-s2UxXdBxgSYLfDxBt-SOYoCr5HC9Kyczkzz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZLOjsmISLfkjDOte3nKeLjUVZPCMe4V0u4zoF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkopU3k0yiO-bReSY66D3JmuOuo_PeOZNGYEw9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfMJvjlCiOBIBAQO4-HeCsqFXQrXKBww__e34W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6jlQbQpjV4EGAwkFvzorI-z55W7btgMBkiM3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX6mQ4Mp4ZVhSyQ4luubekeqccMvT-QzkocbsF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHvhZDq3G8Dj8iyFNzMirS8ngSTGR725YMZevQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKtzeVgZ73-jTmNSWfqhX_xm50RslxmWRl55vu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMziKqRtcC1lTOyrct8iXW8hOG4ZCcZ6KevGgvl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9y1WccqTZBCSLgXKAEH0okm9XRx2AkaTjcbKV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>{'time': 1602135190806, 'text': "Thank you for your visit today!

Great experience and truly delightful staff! Had the pho, matcha boba, and salad rolls (which were exceptionally tasty with the dipping sauce). The outdoor dining space was charming. We were even given complimentary jelly desserts, which were light and perfect at the end of a very filling meal. Will be back when I am in the area!<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>First time here. I had a beef combination pho. I wanted to get boba tea too, but I wanted no ice and they said they don't do that. I've never heard of a restaurant refusing a no-ice request. So I'll never be ordering boba tea here, much as I love boba.

I would normally dock a star for that, but...food was really good (didn't come with bean sprouts tho), outdoor dining courtyard was lovely, service was excellent, and there was a small piece of complimentary carrot cake at the end. I'd come here again. Just not for boba.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Hi folks,
I am a newbie at To Pho. Working here for three days and I’m already in love with the chef! She offers lots of free food to the employees. She thinks that the more the employees know about her food, the better we can serve our lovely customers. I Think that is very mindful and considerate of her to have such mentality as a business owner. The boss (her husband) is a very nice guy! Trying his best to implement new work methods to find out the most efficient ways for us to work comfortably and happily. Sometimes, I and him have different opinions but we are all open for discussions and thus often came to a conclusion for new ideas for our store! The boss is very open about employees idea and appreciate our help to improve his store. I talked to all of the current employees, and they told me they love working here. That makes me really happy because it is hard to find a job now, especially a good one for us to invest our time in. Any jobs would have polices and rules to follow, sometimes we have to give up some of our habits to better fit in certain work environments. It is challenging to adapt as first, but I think eventually we’ll all learn something in the end.
I am very grateful that I have a job during this economical hardship. Just want to shout out to my coworkers for all of their help during my training, and to the chef and my boss for trying to creat such a friendly and funny work environment! Also, thanks to our customers for welcoming me as a new community member here! Please continue to support us as we’ll take care of each other during this hard time.<//text>

First time here, I had dinner with my granddaughter. We have tried pho and fried rice. They are both really delicious. The free desert is really good too. I don't know what is the desert name, but really like it. Definitely come back. Nice staff and good service ♥️< /text>

I work at To Pho too. I work there longer than Twee Van and I really enjoy to work with the chef. Sometime I have a hard time to understand her English, but I learn a lot of good things from her. She always cooks Vietnamese traditional food  and let us try. Whenever my family come and order food, we always get at least 50% off. On mother and father day, my parent get free meal too.
I also receive breaks and lunch and I can eat or drink what ever I want without pay anything. Someday if we are really busy, she also asks me and other employee cook something and bring it home. She even asks me cook extra food and bring it to my mom too.
I ALWAYS GET MY PAY CHECK CORRECTLY. IF THE BOSS ASK ME TO STAY OVERTIME, I ALWAYS GET PAY OVERTIME.<//Review>

< Review>
I have plenty to say about this restaurant and it's owners. If you look closely at some of the five star reviews you can tell something is going on. They're sending their workers out to comment good things. N.G is only commenting to defend his job. I have never worked there but I have plenty of friend's there. Sometimes paychecks are incorrect amounts. Employee's aren't treated as they should. I really want to like this restaurant but theirs to much toxicity between the owners and some cooks. They really need to just take a step back and learn how to properly manage their restaurant.<//Review>

Don't listen to tween van. That worker is actually a very good friend's with the owners and is very biased. Also, tween has only been working there for 3 days. Therefore, they have no idea what it gets like down the road. The chef still has her problems and the owner has no idea what goes on. No wonder they are hardly getting any business. And to try to save it, tween sets up a review to make the restaurant look good. I bet the only two likes it got was from the chef and the owner< /text>

I really like this place. Today was our second time getting takeout from them and both times have been good! We tried the number 24 (chicken and rice), we've tried the pho and the number 18. We've also had their Boba teas which are so good and both times they've added 2 desserts which have been super tasty! I highly recommend this place. Best Asian food I've had in Hollister and very friendly and fast service!< /text>

Great customer service! I have been there 2 times and both times the customer service was amazing. The soups were also delicious. We had Chicken Pho and the Wonton and noodles one. Both had a lot of flavor which I have never found to be the case at any other Pho place I have been to. Their boba was also great. I had the milk tea and the taro. The boba pearls were a great consistency and the tea wasn't too sweet.<//Text>

Good afternoon everyone. Just thought I’d hop on here and share my experiences with this restaurant. I’ve been employed with To Pho for roughly 3 months. Throughout these months, I’ve experienced in incredible amount of changes within the business. But, one thing I haven’t experienced, is being mistreated by the owners or fellow coworkers. My experience has been nothing but positive. My job pretty much includes a little bit of everything, but I mainly answer the phone for takeout orders and questions, I ring customers up on the POS system, and also serve customers dining in with us. I experience a little bit of everything. My boss is an incredibly generous woman, providing all of her employees with free meals throughout the day, as well as beverages and even meals to take home at the end of our shifts for our families. Our breaks are always given on time, as well as our bi weekly salaries. My boss doesn’t speak English very well. With that, it is very common for customers to misunderstand her. Those who were asked to leave To Pho not only misunderstood my boss many times, but also took advantage of her generosity and didn’t adhere to the regulations in place. As unfortunate as it is, it helps the business grow, and helps my boss learn from the past. Now, the business isn’t perfect, there is always room to grow, and with time the business will. As for the reviews, there’s always two or more sides to a story, those reviews provided one. As someone who has been employed far longer than those previous employees, I ask that those who haven’t tried the restaurant to give it a shot. We will do everything we can to make your experience worth it. Thank you all.</review>

< Review>
Food lacks flavor. Doesnt taste authentic. Ordered a soup #9 and it literally only had 1 shrimp and the portion was small even though they said they are all large portions. Eggrolls were decent. Also ordered fried rice which tasted plain. Ill stick with the other pho spot in hollister. I saw what looked like a teenager/young adult making the food  and I guess that should have been the first sign that it wont be authentic.<//Review>

Finally got another pho place in Hollister and I can get my boba fix!  I ordered the Hue Vermicelli and milk tea boba and the hubs got the chicken curry soup.  The vermicelli soup was delish and filling.  Only complaint from the hubs was the chicken in his soup had bones.</review>

< review>
Store #103 Mgr Liz is very rude & disrespectful.  We went in & purchased a Galaxy 10plus & I even purchased internet after being told we would have outstanding & good service.  A few days passed I tested the phone had so many problems with At & t  I was transferred to so many lines etc no one could help me the tech on installation showed at my house without me signing up for him they cancelled my service so I had to reschedule & then he calls the day of my new appt & tells me my location does not receive connection to the internet it would not be worth it.  I ended with frustration & asked for a total refund & went in-store demanded a restocking fee credit.  Do to all the trouble & things I had to go thro & experience.  Today 12/5/19. I spoke to the store Mgr. Liz & she told me I was out & couldn't get my trade in which was a Galaxy 8+. .  She stayed to me I should have not received anything back because the store & herself took a loss out of pocket.  Are you kidding me.  Where?? Is her customer service skills?? I DO NOT recommend AT & T the day that I did the returnso many people that were also there had so many problems & complaints.  Folks save yourselfs & your time.  Go elsewhere where you can be treated & helped with top customer service & cared for.  I definitely will not be returning or recommending AT & T in the future. Oh & by the way Liz the Store mgr store #103 in Sanger Can hung up on me & I wasn't even rude to her .  So sad people stay away .  Not sure why?? Sh has this position if she can't work & handle it.<//review>

AT&T has been my phone carrier for the last I don't know 20 years ever since I got my phone at AT&T I just wish that they were the apostles a little bit more competitive once in awhile it turns out that I get a problem and I got to go in the store personally but otherwise in that they're good people I've gotten a laptop a phone for my granddaughter my wife's lines on the same bill so I just wish it was a little bit more keeper for the senior citizen check it out if you need a phone<//text>

I needed my new iPhone activated. Rep told me the screen touch wasn't working and handed me the phone. I pushed a button and screen worked. Rep pushed a few more buttons and told me it wasn't accepting my apple ID. I pushed a few more buttons and signed in. Handed phone back to Rep and he told me phone wasn't unlocked and I'd need to go somewhere and get it unlocked. I purchased an unlocked phone so I pushed a few more buttons and my new phone started working just fine. I feel Rep wanted to sell me a phone and was hoping I was stupid enough to fall for his untrue representations. Be careful if you go in here. Don't fall for their lies. I won't be returning.<//text>

< review>
We have been customers since the company name was "Cingular". For nearly 18 yrs now. We always pay our bill online. We decided since we needed a liquid screen protector for a new phone, we would make a payment on our bill at the same time at this location. We ALWAYS pay our bill online, deal with the home store, or the other Blackstone location near Hobby Lobby in Fresno. The incompetence at this location is appalling!! They transposed the phone number after we were asked for it and credited the WRONG ACCOUNT! After prompting with multiple questions and being told that the very limited receipt that had none of our customer info on it was connected to our acct, but turned out to be the wrong one, that their mgr couldnt help us. REPEATEDLY we have called and cisited this location. We have been having to chase $300.00 for nine, yes 9 days now with no one working on this!! They have very poor customer service/retail experience and deserve this bad rating. If I were any of you, the drive to Fresno is definitely worth it to avoid the lack of care for so much money we have paid out, especially for such loyal customers!! They will be lucky if they don't lose us as customers because of this. AT&T should be ashamed at the fact that their name is on this store location!!<//review>

< Review>
I was looking for a better insurance than the one that I had and Farmers came through with a better policy. They were efficient and affordable, they also were quick to respond to all my questions. Unlike my previous insurance they were always out of the office & never got back to me when I needed them. Thank Farmers for your great service.<//Review>

The overall process was pretty smooth, especially being able to sign the documents electronically. The agent (Blanca T.) answered all questions I had throughout the process. The main reason I dropped 1 star was for them not having a mobile app at this time. The insurance I was quoted was not directly with Farmers but a subsidiary (Farmers auto specialty). I understand this might be nitpicking however I enjoy the easy of doing everything on a phone app for the convenience.< /text>

<Review>I had farmers insurance else where but I switched here because of the great customer service. Whenever I have an issue they resolve it immediately. They are transparent with everything and clear explanations are given of my coverage and any questions I have. I went through so many auto insurances, I feel confident with only this location. They really do hire professionals, they are resourceful towards everything. Thank you for everything!< /Review><Time>1597999362196< /Time>< GmapID>

I've always experienced great professional service since switching to Farmers four years ago.

Recently I added renters insurance and Alejandra Hernandez went over and above her duty as an agent to ensure I received the best coverage and pricing available to me.

I am very pleased with my agents.<//Review>

Martha has been my insurance agent for years. She has not helped only myself get the best rate and quality insurance, but my mom and best friend too. She has always been so efficient. I will refer everyone to Farmers, because I trust that they care and I can truly share no complaints.< /review>

I recently purchased a new car and needed insurance ASAP, Blanca Tapia was very helped me achieve that easily and quickly. I was able to get my car insured with no problem at all and I did not feel pressured to get insured with them like other companies tend to make you feel. She helped me understand what my policy will cover and was very patient with me as I had to do this process amidst a very busy work week as well as all through email. She was very efficient and helpful. Highly recommend!<//Text>

Navigating insurance can be tedious but luckily the team there takes the stress off my shoulders and explains things to me in a kind way. I’ve never gone through an annoying phone tree - usually always a direct line to an agent. They also send holiday and birthday cards which is a nice touch I think!</text>< pics>

I have been a customer with this agency for four years. They gave me the best quote, but that was not the only reason why I chose to go with them. Dan Kitajima is really an awesome agent. He is honest, cool and super helpful. He has helped me get discounts; he helps when I have questions. He makes everything super easy. He is great at his job. I am very happy that I went with them :)</review>

Blanca helped me and my fiancé get an affordable good insurance right away, she’s very reliable, she was always there to assist me and answer all my questions, I didn’t even have to go to their office, she did everything electronically. For anybody looking for car insurance, I would recommend them 100%</Text>

< Review>
I sold my previous vehicle about 2 weeks ago, and just got a new one yesterday.

The transition was done smoothly, quickly, and easily, OVER THE PHONE - you don't even need to be present, with Alexandra Q. along with really helpful advice.

I have been a client with this firm for about 3 years. And I can't recall a single complaint about its service. Keep it up, guys!

Thanks you!!!</Review>

<username>Rina< /username><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I have and will continue to recommend Kitajima Agency to all my family and friends. Dan Kitajima and his agents are very helpful and always available when you have questions regarding your policy. They will even go out of their way to look for discounts to help YOU which is hard to find in an insurance agency.

If you have a bad driving record, you know that your insurance costs are horrible. I am so glad that I found Kitajima Agency because I am paying half of what I would be paying with other major carriers. They definitely saved my wallet!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great agency....great Insurance rep....very responsive. Dan was extremely helpful when I needed him most ( right after an accident ). Walked me through the process and put me on the "fast-track" in working with the claims adjuster and coordinating everything with the local auto body shop!
I recommend them highly! You won't be disappointed!</Review>< user_id>

I have been with this Branch for a few years now didn't have any issues until I got earthquake policy with them I was given misinformation about the policy and when I called back to get it rectified I was told I would get a call back by an employee same day I did not I call back a few days later and I talked to the person who set up the policy I was told by her that I would get a call back after I explained the situation and she said she would talk to her billing department but I still didn't receive one I left several messages and it has been over a week now and I still have not received the call back I suspect that I'm not giving a call back because they are very well aware that they made a mistake and they don't want to own up to it I will not deal with an office that does not take care of its customers after given misinformation and not even giving the callbacks that they promised and it's been over a month and a half since the initial call I am not a complainer but this is definitely not how you handle customer service< /text>

After dealing with a handful of different companies and agents of the last years, I was glad to have found Dan's Farmers office. Janet Diaz has been an absolute pleasure to deal with! They make everything so clear, easy and are very accommodating.
You will not find a better agent around. end of story!

< Review>
I had a perfect driving record for over 30 years until I got a misdemeanor DUI. Of course my insurance carrier decided to triple my premium even though I had so many years of good driving. As I shopped around and getting frustrated, I came upon Janet Diaz and the Kitajima Insurance Group. Not only did she work with me on a decent premium, they didn't make me feel like a convict...sometimes all we need is another chance and the Kitajima Agency provided me that. Thanks to Janet and the whole team.

The Agency representatives have consistently answered or found answers to my every query and worked hard to give myself and son rates that seem fair and economical.  An honest agency in California no less.

Thank you Kitajima Agency and thank you Janet Lisa Diaz!

I heartily recommend to anyone who is seeking insurance for their health, life, auto, etc. the Kitajima Agency located in Tustin, CA.  From my first contact; until the final conversation; the staff were friendly;professional; and qualified regarding finding out what I was seeking to do and coming up with options that gave me a clear idea of the best program that was suitable for my needs.

I plan on referring the agency to any and all of my friends and associates for all of their insurance needs.</Review>

I want to report that no company had been able to give me an Insurance at such a low cost as Farmers and the best thing is that too. They speak Spanish and their treatment is great !!

(Translated by Google) Call to quote my 2013 Jeep grand cherokee, I gave my data they told me that then they would tell me the value when they call me back they tell me that the policy is around $ 440 I thought it must be a liability a year, when the girl tells me it is a month 😱 I asked him is it a policy or are they going to sell me another car, once again another lie that the price will be low it seems that the qualifications are from the same or relatives of those who work there is the first time they tell me that a car insurance per month $ 440

(Original)
Llame a cotizar mi 2013 Jeep grand cherokee, di mis datos me dijeron que luego me decían el valor cuando me devuelven la llamada me dicen que la póliza es al rededor de $440  pensé debe ser una liability al año, cuando la chica me dice que es al mes 😱 le pregunté es una póliza o me van a vender otro carro, una vez más otra mentira que el precio será bajo parece que las calificaciones son de los mismo o familiares de lo que trabajan ahí es la primera vez que me dicen que un seguro de carro por mes $440<//review>

It's not like this is what we have and already. If not I think they always look for some solution that the client feels good ..

<review>Solid supermarket option with an extensive beer, wine and liquor area for a store such as this. Also has dedicated areas for Jewish, Asian and Mexican food supplies and sundries. The bakery and deli section is large and the vegetable selection is fair. But this is more of a general grocery store still than a specialized. They have the occasional specialty item that surprises but if you want health food only or luxury food items, than other stores may be better for some of your items. Their own sourdough bread is one of the highlights as is the fact they often have two for one on McConnell’s ice cream!< /review>< username>

Our first time shopping at this store.  It is very large and well organized. There was an employee sanitizing carts upon arrival to store, which is smart with covid. There is a big floral and baked goods section. There is also a Starbucks.  The aisles are narrow but many older stores struggle with this. There is  ample parking, which I have come to appreciate so much in Los Angeles. There are beautiful bougainvillea fowers by the parking lot (see photo) All of the  employees were friendly and the store was very clean.</Text>

I like this store friendly people.  The people that work there are really nice. Special employee(Stacy).It's clean.  It's well stocked. There are other stores in this city. For me I rather go to this one. Armando is a manager.  This man is a very kind person. I'm so glad he works at this location.  This company are very lucky to have this man on there team. He has helped me for years. Smiles< /review>

Surprisingly not very overpriced, but they will have just about anything you could want for everyday and casual celebratory events.  Generic statement, somewhat unique feeling whenever I go - like they're gonna have some cool version of what I'm looking for.< /Text>

It’s a Pavilions, so the in store experience is usually really nice. Carts are clean. Parking is the only issue here. The lot attendants (there are usually at least 2) will watch if you seem like you’re going elsewhere (or plan to) and you can get towed. Each time I’ve been here I’ve seen someone being towed. This is necessary due to the lack of parking for most of the businesses in the surrounding area. But it still makes me nervous even when I’m here for legit reasons, haha< /text>

This place is amazing except for the new guy ELOY at the seafood department has a really bad attitude. I asked him if i could get some crab legs and it was 5 minutes before 9 and he said no sorry he already started closing. I think hes really lazy and has a poor attitude. If you want to be rude go work with boxes or something you cant disappoint.</text>

This location is great, though I have to admit it's the only one I've visited. The staff are ALL so very friendly. From the sushi bar staff to the cashiers, all have been helpful and kind. I visit the fresh deli most often and have loved everything I've tried. Today, I've noticed they offered some new salads and now I must return to try them. Fresh, clean, fast, friendly... what more can you ask for?<//Review>

<review>Large selection of well stocked produce, dairy, meats, snacks and household goods. I stopped here on Halloween when they had a ton of people walking through, and the whole thing was managed fantastically.

Great selection of prepared foods, healthy organic salad and a quick grab-and-go session. I was impressed by their ready-made hot food selections. You can get mashed potatoes and gravy and paninis here.

You can get a dozen roses for $12.99 every day. Amazing section of flowers and plants - I was impressed by the variety.

Rows of alcohol for you to choose from! You’ll definetley find something you like.< /review>< user_id>

Excellent hot food section, bread, fruit and veggies Dept, great organic sections and not too expensive.
Friendly busy staff and good check out.

I was trying to reach the Bakery for 15 min, the call kept getting redirected to another department and they kept redirecting me to the Bakery who never picked up the phone. I was trying to order a cake for my 2 year olds birthday. I have been in here a few times to get sushi and the ladies are really nice its to bad the bakery isn't as professional as them.<//text>

30 years I’ve gone here: and 2 years into the renovation and post self serve Covid-19 era: I found it ultra highly lit: and spacious: as a vegan though I was overwhelmed by the cheese acreage and miles of processed meats: but that’s carnivores for you.  Lots of hand sanitizer available and a dutiful cart clerk<//text>

Never dare to go again!  You will be fined for parking in the parking lot while shopping! When shopping in this supermarket!  Tickets for parking also need to be issued!  At 1:13 am on November 9, 2019, I was issued a parking ticket while parking in this supermarket!  When I walked to the parking lot after shopping, I saw the parking lot manager giving a ticket to my car!  I said I was here for shopping!  When did the parking lot manager collect my shopping invoice!  Then tell me no problem!  But on the morning of November 29, I still received a ticket!  I immediately drove to the supermarket for more than an hour to find management instructions!  But the management asked me to go to the municipal government to solve it!  Supermarket parking ticket!

The West Hollywood store refused to refund or exchange unopened supplements that I mistakingly bought the day before...they stated that they've never reinstuted any type refund policy due to COVID. Every other store I shop at not only accepts returns but even accepts returned food items - I might add the other stores have been accepting returns for months now.

I dare say, the 'Pavillions Corporate' policy that they hide behind is lame. They claim the strictness is due to COVID - more like a revenue generator.

I have lots of choices of where I shop and won't be "returning" to Pavillions - I suggest you don't either. Companies that aren't even willing to return or exchange unopened,  vacuum sealed/protected supplements clearly aren't supportive of customers who make honest mistakes.  It's a shame because I was a loyal customer for decades. Oh well...I'm lucky I have so many other choices, including Amazon...lol.< /review>

This is one of the places that I miss so much now that I live downtown. When I was in the neighborhood this was my only grocery store. I actually went to the opening after a long year of construction. I have brought family from Europe to the store because it's just not like anything else. They call it a lifestyle store and it's true to its name. The staff is wonderful and if you go there regularly they will remember you. Great selection of fish meat and you cannot beat the produce here. All this in an atmosphere that makes you want to come back. Make sure to go in the back corner and try the bakery, their stuff Rivals bakeries in Paris.<//Text>

Friendly employees, which is unusual in L.A.  Almost everyone greets you.  They are good about that.  Aisles are narrower since the remodel about 20 years ago so they could fit more stuff in.  Good selection of prepared foods too, bakery, deli, etc.  Plenty of parking too when you remember the roof parking, too.< /Review></record>

GREAT SELECTION and PRICES!
Tons to choose from...household name-brands, store brand items, specialty brands, & organic options. Excellent wine, bakery & floral departments. Pharmacy inside store (special hours see store's website). Starbucks kiosk. Sushi counter with seating. Sandwich station. Soup section. Table & seating area. Deli & Meat/Seafood could be better but no big complaints. Produce department is NOT so great.

* 24-HRS

* Lots of PARKING  - I've never had to park in the attached structure but I know it's easy elevator access.

* Fantastic LOW PRICES - and go even lower when you download the Just4U app, which gives  you digital coupons & personalized discounts - I've received free milk, spinach dip, salad dressings, and more!

* And again, EXCEPTIONAL WINE selection ... Lorie is the best and she really knows the wines so don't hesitate to ask for recommendation!<//text>

<time>1583967138553<//time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>As a patron customer, today's experience topped the worst in many years.

As everyone else I was wondering when they will be restocking larger size water bottles.

I did not have luck until I saw an asian man with a Pavilion badge. It might of wrote manager/supervisor. He was walking fast.. passing when I was about to ask a question. He never stopped and looked but refused to answer my questions. He gave me the impression that customers assistance was not as important than what he was about to go or do.

Wondering...was this an emergency.

Or....

Is this how a customer should be treated now?

During usually challenging times do we treat customer like third rate citizens?<//Text>< pics>

This location is awesome. With all that's going on right now, this store is so well-managed !!!! Safe spacing, individually cleaned carts, and just enough essentials to calm nerves.
THANK YOU PAVILIONS !!!!<//review>

I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT WEST HOLLYWOOD PAVILLIONS. IT'S A FIVE STAR
🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
HIGH END GROCERY STORE.
THE FRUITS, VEGGIES, MEATS, AND SEAFOOD ARE ALWAYS
SO FRESH AND DELICIOUS.

I DO MISS THE FRESH JUICE BAR. THE ALCOHOL 🍸 SECTION IS OUT OF THIS WORLD 🌎.
CAN WE SAY WINE CELLAR OMG!
THE STAFF AND CREW ARE AMAZING.

THE STORE IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED. I LOVE THE FLORAL DEPARTMENT AND THE HOT FOOD SECTION. TRY THE HABANERO CHICKEN! SO YUMO.

YOU CAN ALSO FIND A DEAL OR TWO IN THE CLEARANCE ISLE OR ON SEASONAL ITEMS. NOT TO MENTION A STARBUCKS FOR A ONE STOP SHOP. THEY HAVE THE MOST DELICIOUS CAKES AND PASTRIES.

IF YOU NEED HELP PLANNING YOUR NEXT EVENT OR DINNER PARTY CONTACT THE CONCIERGE. ❤🎉❤🎉❤< /Review>

This is a great pavilions. Very clean and huge. They have the self check out area which is super nice and great deli sandwiches with an amazing salad bar. You make your salad from the countless ingredients they have available and it's charged by the pound. Delicious ♥< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I have a routine everyday that I'd like to stick to. Starbucks being opened inside Pavilions was the best news ever after realising how many Starbucks were closed due to covid19. I appreciate the fact that they remained opened! Thank you Pavilions and Starbucks, for being opened! Starbucks, your Matcha-Soy Frappuccino, with 3-4 extra scoops of matcha, and whip, yes, I love both! Anyways, it's my reward, after working out, and I always look forward to drinking it!  Thank you again! 💯💕</text>< Pictures>

This Pavilions is WAY overpriced! They sell some items I can't get elsewhere. Some of their generics are really good, like their ready made salads (3/$10). I'd suggest a loyalty card.</Text>

Oh my God I love this place. They have everything. Employees are so helpful and nice. Food is really tasteful. Sometimes they have good specials. The only thing I don't like is their restroom. There has been times they are closed do to repairs they say. I go at night and I feel safe going there.</Text>

<Text>We like to shop here for years, friendly staff, fresh produce and a huge variety of products. Nevertheless, since Feb. they don't accept my Google Pay anymore. Everytime they promise to fix it but nothing happens. Now I am turning myself to Sprouts and Trader Joe's, they accept my Google Pay. Just let me know when it's been fixed. Update. It has been fixed and it works. Great!< /Text><rate>5<//rate><time>1570426805129<//time>< response>

This is a decent grocery store. They have a nice selection of wine and beer, and even hard liquor. Nice selection of fresh organic fruits and vegetables. They also offer many options for quick lunch or dinner in their food court. Also, there is a Starbucks inside, but these days where isn't one?<//text>

I needed a quick gift to bring to a friend.  The flower shop here has some beautiful flowers to choose from at a very reasonable price.  I chose a bouquet of multi colored mini roses for only $12.99.</Text>

It really sucked I don't know why anybody would shop here unless it's just too busy to go somewhere else I'm giving a review for Pavilions this morning. 1 I need a 9-volt battery and wind up asking three different people where they were to Ted look as you go out to check out in the front the 3rd finally showed me that there was a a checkout line the first landed men closed off you couldn't get in it from the store and you had to squeeze between boxes to get into find 9 volt batteries and I'll buy the way one of the two batteries didn't work when I got home next I needed to get some vinegar it took three different people to finally get me to the right place but luckily when it was near that out but the real loser of the day was I went to get cold cuts that was Men in front of me we waited for like 45 minutes I saw a Gentleman Just To the Left around the left straightening out counter asked for his help he said I will help someone will help you in a little while after another three or four minutes I walked over we're still sitting at the counter said can you help me or get someone here that could help me had a snide remark and it came over and helping gentleman who's there before me as you should have it was a terrible shopping experience I just wish they'd Senior Management could have been there and made it themselves<//text>

<text>The best Pavilions in all of Los Angeles. The West Hollywood location is a fairly new store. Very large grocery store with everything you could think of. Well stocked and very clean. This location includes a deli, a sushi bar, a Starbucks, and a pressed juice bar. Very friendly and helpful staff. Large parking lot surrounded by other retailers. There's also parking on top of the roof.</text>< Rating>

THANK YOU! I have been a customer for over 20 years of this Pavilions location, even way before the beautiful expensive remodel. And I had to take a minute of my day to give PRAISES and THANKS to all the AMAZING EMPLOYEES that have worked at Pavilions. I am so honored and blessed to be able to shop and find the BEST DEALS for all my needs. And I DO SHOP! THANK  YOU AGAIN!< /text>

The meat and seafood are sky high in prices.  I went there TODAY and purchased WILD CAUGHT Shrimp and I even asked the attendant how long it would last in the ice box and he said 2-3 days.  I came home and within 2 hours - I was making shrimp scampi for myself and a guest.  One bite and the ammonia taste was disgusting and nothing is worse than seafood poisoning.  I'm sorry - but they should know better than that.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Purchased a box of fried chicken tenders...ate two and felt very sick. Didn't think anything of it and my fiancè just ate one. She spat out a bite saying it tasted weird. This is the RAW fried chicken tender. When I called Pavillions the manager said to COME IN----meanwhile my fiance is throwing up violently in the bathroom and we probably are heading to the ER any minute. Waiting for her to stop puking. Manager said the best they could do is reimburse the $7 for the chicken. NEVER shopping at this Pavillions again and WILL SUE if she ends up in the ER. The discoloration was because we put guacamole on it---and we tried to wipe it off for the picture.< /text>

I go to this store all the time! I can find whatever I am looking for with ease and can also count on a fresh product time after time! I wanted to name mention a few great employees who make shopping at this store that much easier whether it is Anthony in the meat dept making sure I get the best meat along with some of the fastest service with a smile, or Omar or Steven at checkout asking me how my day is going, or Kenneth one of the managers who always makes a point to say hello when he sees me around! I know I am welcome and among friends at this store, and that is a great feeling! I can’t tell you how happy I am with the outstanding service day after day! Thanks pavillions!<//text>

I like this grocery it is very neighborhood friendly to patrons familiar and unfamiliar.  My favorite things are the salad bar and the organic fruit & veggie selection.  Great product presentation and selections on new items are rolled out frequently.  And yes there is a Starbucks at this location</Review>

I really love the wide variety and great quality of items. The boutique like setting is very unique. Love all the gourmet and unique products that are nicely desplayed. My only problem is that the isles are so narrow its hard to shop. Bumping into customers cannot be avoided.< /Text>

< review>
I am very fond of Pavilions market overall their produce is very fresh and high-quality their selection in general is quite varied and so is the meat and seafood section. Also they have a pharmacy at all locations and I personally have been dealing with their Pharmacy for over 25 years and they have always been very helpful and very conscientious. The one thing you have to be careful about whenever you are shopping is price and to actually stay within a budget you need to go to three to five different stores and buy the Lost leader items and buy them in quantity and store them or put them in the freezer so you get a really good deal and you'll also build up points on your savings card to get a nice discount off of gasoline at several of the name brand stations. Most sincerely, Stephen Valentino< /review>

I used to go there once a week or so.  It is a big supermarket and you will find what you are looking for as they have mostly everything you need!  Good selection of fruits!  They also have a big parking lot!<//review>

The enjoyed the burrito the first time I got it so I came back. Twice after that I left because I wasted 5 minutes of my lunch break waiting to be helped. This time I was the only person there and tried to make it really easy by saying I'll take everything that comes inside, I'm not picky. Her attitude just through me off and I just left. I wanted to complain to the manager but decided not to waste anymore of my lunch break in that place.< /Text><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Parking is great and alongside a bigger plaza area with more stores and attractions.

I particularly enjoy Pavillions' soup section and sandwiches. If you have their rewards card and use it every time you purchase a deli sandwich from them, you get a free one after seven (i think) purchases. So there's a loyalty program for sandwich purchasing - cool!

They also have a Starbucks inside this area so you can get your coffee fix conveniently.<//Text><Name>alice chung< /Name>< Date>

< Review>
Probably the nicest grocery store I've been in.  Also it seemed to have a nicer selection then the Pavilions close to my home. Especially the bakery. It had a collection of gormet cookies that was help yourself and priced per pound that I've not seen before.  I could be wrong.  It makes sense though. The W.Hollywood Pavilions is a stones throw from Beverly Hills with it's residents being the majority of it's customer base...< /Review>

Sales people were obliging with great attitudes. Pavillion had the items that were on my shopping list. I'm from Northern Virginia and the store aisles were wide and signs were as easy to read as my local grocery stores.<//text>

Decent and clean grocery store. I'm giving 3 stars because considering that the store is in the middle of hipster AF Los Angeles, the deli area (especially sandwich area) should have more vegetarian options, or more accurately, vegetarian options in general...<//Review>

You have to love this Pavilions. It is like the best store to shop and they have everything and you might just run into a local celeb or like a big Hollywood Starlet I swear. I have been coming to this store to get change for years. And I love that customer service as well.</text>

<review>Not the employees fault but the store has gone downhill since Vons/Pavilions was bought out. Often out of stock in the market and we are told the truck didn't arrive. Prior to the merger trucks were here every day and it wasn't an issue. The same with the Pharmacy, we often almost always have to go back another day because they are out of stock on a prescription we need.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>This store is the best grocery in West Hollywood, they have everything you could want in a grocery store, great deli complete with sushi, hot bar, fresh salads, sandwiches, and soups. As well as a great meat department. They have a wonderful produce section and even a kambucha bar! I must say though above all exquisite customer service! Every time I go in there if I have any questions someone is there to help. I must point out Kenneth in particular! Whenever I go through his line at the register he always asks me how my day was and really makes me feel welcome! I am always happy to see him at the store, and I feel like he is happy to see me! What a great person! He deserves employee of the month as far as I am concerned! I hope that he will get some recognition for this and I will be back shopping tomorrow! Thanks Pavillions!</Text></record>

<text>Really, you're rating a grocery store? Yes, yes, I am.

This Pavillions was remade from scratch around 2010-2011.  It's in a great shopping center with AMPLE parking.

The store is big and has everything you could hope to find including a gigantic flower section.< /text>< user>

This is my go-to grocery store in West Hollywood. They have a great variety of products and a lot of it is for a fair price.  I particularly love it when the wine sampling is happening. ha ha< /Text>

<text>Title:  Don't shop at Pavilions :-))  Especially not in West Hollywood, especially not in the early morning and not in the evening :-)))

Unexpectedly awful!  The lack of customer service was unbelievable!

First,  the West Hollywood location is a 24 hour store.  However, as I arrived early in the day, ALL of the isles were blocked with merchandise, with employees hardly in sight, and making it not only difficult but unsafe to navigate through the store.
It was as if there were no consistent plan of restocking.  With very few exceptions (and I mean only one guy) the employees were so unwilling to make any accommodation for the morning customers!  It was as if we all were some unwelcome guests, like we were inconveniencing them!

Then, they did not have in stock the item advertised by their "Monopoly" game.  That wouldn't have been so bad, except they did not try to provide any assistance in substituting it with a similar product.  They just stamped my coupon, explaining it is the same as offering me a rain-check.  FALSE!  When I went to another store, the manager said she would love to help, but it seems the coupon has already been redeemed BECAUSE OF ITS STAMP...?!!!

So I went back to West Hollywood, after talking on the phone with one of its managers, supposedly.  I told him I will be at the store soon, and he promised to assist me, yet when I arrived, I was told he was on lunch, and they did not know when he'd be back!!!!  Seriously, how much time does a Pavilions store manager get for lunch?  We, common folk, would like to know :-))

So another manager, Greg Priestley or something, supposedly was recommended to assist me.  First, I got to witness the attitude he had towards another lady customer who wanted a discount for her groceries.  Boy, was he obnoxious!  So I knew I shouldn't expect much of him to start with, but, patiently, I decided to pursue what now became an issue of principle more than anything else.  I believe in being treated right as a customer, and I was going to get that... or so I thought.  I could not have been more wrong!!!

First, he said he cannot do anything for me because he already did all the substitutions he could have.  Incredible, isn't it?  With a store with thousands of items, he is telling me there is nothing he can do, and the warehouse doesn't have the item either... ???

Then he requests - without solving my issue - for me to move to the side of the cash register he was at... so that he can help ANOTHER customer!!!  In other words, he simply dismissed me!  OMG moment when I realized that.
So I demand - again, way more polite than the shyster deserves it - that he either gives me an item similar in type, either he at least voids the stamp that impedes me from redeeming the coupon at another store.  At which he reluctantly asks an employee to look through his bag of coupons and find me an identical one, but of course, without the stamp.  Which the employee, indeed did.

But wait, this isn't over yet!  I return now to the store whose manager said would honor the coupon only if it didn't have the stamp :-)))  If anything, I am persistent...  And pissed, by now.  I go only to find that the manager that said that left for the day and there is no manager for the shift, because the night manager, due to Memorial Day weekend (my note :-))  just called in sick.
Eventually a good humored cashier, and the only one with a smile on her face out of all the Pavilions employees I managed to see that day redeems the coupon and makes the substitution that could've, would've, should've been a breeze.  End of story.  Or is it?

Well, listen up, Pavilions people.  There is no job in customer service without the customer.  So don't f... yourselves up.

Thank you for reading this post.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Good place to eat lunch, the security is not professional they profile you if your black shopping with a reusable grocer bag.  I have been ostracized for not being homosexual from cashiers and patrons.  Don't spend a lot of time shopping here, unless you want your own security detail.</Review>

Pavilions in WeHo is my favorite market not only because the food is fresh, the store is clean and I feel I get great deals there.. But it's a great store because it melds so well with the neighborhood. WeHo is a special place because it stands as a beacon of equality. And Pavilions is very much part of the community. And in this day and age of Trump, his cult and all the hate, bigotry, racism and misogyny they spew.. it's always great to feel that some freedoms and rights are still being protected.</Text>

If you're thinking about getting lunch at the deli, make sure you have plenty of time. They are not Time sensitive. If you like any of groceries and night, they are always under stuff.< /review>

The prices are high, selection can be bad, the deli is high-drama, bakery good, staff gets snarly - the deli needs a reorg.  The meat and the meat guys used to be outstanding.  There was a time when I would have said Buy ur fish, all ur meat here.< /text>

It's a decent store. Don't like that they sold me old chicken and fries for 7 dollars. It also seems a little uptight with the clientele that goes there<//Text>

You can't find many markets along Santa Monica BLVD, so this place surely comes in handy.  They provide all ingredients needed along with a helpful staff.  A great alternative to Ralphs.<//Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>It 's great idea to have such a nice Starbucks in the grocery store. I bought a croissant  over there 1/16/17. It was very cold and cashier Rebecca suggested to warm it up. Just at home, I noticed "Add lemonade for $0.50" in receipt. Q1:May be this ADD for microwave using?
On my question why don't the price tags over there, I got the answer: Ask Starbucks admin... Q2: Why we cannot see how mush we should  pay?</review>< Pics>

Shop At Pavilions!

Since the Monopoly game has started, I have been going to this particular Pavilions almost on a Daily Basis to Buy Food and Get My Game Pieces.

Sadly, they do Not Seem To Print Any Of The Important Game Pieces, however, I have been able to Win things like Free Bottles Of Aspirin and Plenty Of Packets Of Gravy and Tomato Sauce and even a Loaf Of French Bread and a Donut or Bagel.

Well, during my visit back on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, I bumped into Perla who is a Beautiful Dog who was shopping with her owner in one of the aisles and I decided to take a picture with her.

I want to personally Thank Perla the Dog for taking a picture with ME and her owner for allowing Perla to do so.

Sincerely yours,

Pavs has everything you need, and nice associates who will help you find it, buy it and bag it. The parking lot can be a bit of a demolition derby... It's less fraught up on the roof.< /Text>

< review>
#1) don’t use their self checkout area. It kept glitching and prompting message screens which took forever to revert back.

#2) after a little bit of research I’m finding most “sales” prices that are included with the membership card are actually overpriced and the discount card isn’t actually a discount at all. We purchased food at the self check out and forgot to use the card, resulting in me paying marked up prices. This is why they use the discount card even if you aren’t a member when you go through the normal line.</review>

The best thing I like about this market is it's wonderful employees. They are kind and always very helpful. The bathroom is clean and the Starbucks is staffed by an absolutely wonderful crew. They have a wide variety of cheeses and meat but when it comes to produce there are some items that are only available in the organic more pricey section. That goes for most of the items in the store. If you are looking for a cheap shopping spree, pavilions just isn't the spot. Check out Trader Joe's at westbourne and santa monica. If you need a few items though, pavilions is good for its convenience and ease of parking.</Review>

Best large chain grocery shopping in West Hollywood. Even better if you belong to their computerized savings programs. They carry everything you could possibly need and have specialty shops inside like Stasrbucks, fresh Sushi maker, florists, deli, bakery, liquor dept, pharmacy, and more. They will take orders in advance and have them ready for you for special occasions. Parking is available, but it is also on the busline and served easily by Uber.< /text>

<text>They have a bathroom with no code needed, ✅ healthy selection ✅, nice staff and security 🛂, self checkouts 🛄, and both an elevator and staircase to access the 2nd floor parking level 🛑. It’s everything I want in grocery store, except the fish smell is out of control and the prices for items (Mom’s Best Cereal) for example, are cheaper at places like Vons and Ralphs. ❌❌❌<//text>< Pictures>

Nearly 5 stars, good combos for workers lunch!  8 pcs ($6,99) of roast chicken is the best deal, they have almond sugar thing and it's gluten free! The 1 missing star is because the bakery doesn't do much for gluten free intolerants!!!!!< /review>

<text>There are two locations near my home. I would have gladly driven all the way back 2 the edge of San Bernardino County had I known that this restroom was going to look and smell like a f****** murder scene. I was overwhelmed by the fumes of straight scat. The Curley's on the back of my neck straightened out and I just couldn't find enough paper products to touch the faucet touch the soap dispenser and finally touched the door handle in order to get the f*** out of there. I feel so sorry for the cleanup team at this hour. Seeing as how the two people that I encountered in this place seem to have a very blase, jaded, glassy-eyed look of compliance. Some kind of superhero needs to take over the managerial position and get some people who really want a job.< /text>< user_id>

nasty the ground beef and other meats are kept in the stair ways of the employee break room uncovered at a unproper temperature for long periods of time before packaging which causes the meat to be red on the out side but brown on the inside. The Deli department keeps the same vegetables and meat for sandwiches overnight and not chilled and will serve the next day. The Deli manager is rude. The store director is very unprofessional<//Review>
