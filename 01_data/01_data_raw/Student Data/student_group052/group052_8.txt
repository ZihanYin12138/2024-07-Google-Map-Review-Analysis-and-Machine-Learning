<review>I started my experience with Dr. Riar’s Dental about a year ago. Every time I have gone in, I feel welcome and cared for. All the five star ratings given are true!!! The office is so nice and clean. All staff are kind and provide excellent bedside manner to each patient. As a patient, I don’t feel like just another patient. I have built a great relationship with the staff. I feel so comfortable at each visit and receive great dental care. I highly recommend this office.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Riar and his team are easily the best dental team in all of Bakersfield, and I doubt it's close .. between his professionalism, his sense of humor, his bedside manor and his staff--who are all great--Dr. Riar makes the dental experience a pleasant one.  I showed up at his office needing a lot of work done and in a lot of pain .. several visits later, my teeth look much better and I feel much better.  Hands down:  the best in town<//Review>

The staff is so friendly. The office is clean and welcoming. I highly recommend this dental office to anyone. My kids love it here, and are no longer terrified of dental visits. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would. Give them a try! You won’t regret it.</Text>

I know it is odd to say how much you appreciate your dentist but I am. Dr Riar and his staff are amazing. Dr Riar is kind and patient and always explains things in a way that I can understand.

They are also gentle and work well with people who might have fears.  I have a 11 year old daughter who understandably get nervous but Dr Riar and his stafff always make her feel comfortable and safe.  My daughter lost her retainer at Olive Garden but her Ortho is based in San Diego. Dr Riar jumped right into action and coordinated with her Ortho in San Diego and made the molds and everything for her to get a new one saving us a trip to San Diego. I will forever be grateful for that.

I highly recommend him and his staff all wonderful people who really care your concerns. They are accommodating with appointments and understand when things happen. No judgement ever.   I would never go to another dentist.</Text>

<review>I never write reviews, but this is hands down the most pleasant dental office I have ever been to.
...I always wonder if places with so many 5 star reviews are legit- Well, I can honestly tell you this place has definitely earned the reviews you see.

The staff members are genuinely friendly and gentle. Dr. Riar is skilled and has great bedside manner. The office and its equipment is modern, I never wait long or feel rushed, and they even have all the small details (like chapstick and water bottles) to help you feel comfortable. I literally have no complaints and highly recommend this office to everyone.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I had a wonderful experience while at Dr. Riar’s dental practice today.  They have very friendly competent workers who make sure you’re comfortable and have everything you need for a pleasant appointment. The doctor is extremely intelligent and makes sure nothing is raising a red flag that needs to be checked before letting you leave. All their bright smiles are so welcoming and make for a bearable time at the dentist.<//Review>

Everyone at Riar Dental Arts is very good at what they do. One always feels well cared for. Dr. Riar is very thorough, has a gentle touch, and tells you in terms that you can understand what your options are. I have seen many dentists in my life (I'm 70 years old) and Dr. Riar is by far the best!</review>

Dr. Riar is truly an artist with my teeth.
My teeth have never felt or looked better.

<time>1484099481884<//time><rating>5< /rating><Text>Dr. Riar is by far the best dentist I have ever had!!! (I have had many in my lifetime). He's beat them all.

The number one reason - is his GENUINE  friendliness and concerns for his patients! When I tell him my concerns or fears - HE  INTENTLY PAYS ATTENTION and is patient - even understanding with my hectic life. I really appreciate that.  It's not fake! You feel like you're talking to a friend :))

On top of all of that his office is clean well equipped and his office staff is SO SWEET- constantly offering or asking if we need anything.

Last and not least he's SHARP - breaks things down in easy terms and is very informative and thorough in his explanation of needs- including giving overall advice about life and health!

He did great work on my husband, daughter and is taking care of my dental needs in a well thought out plan.

I feel like I'm going to a 5-star hotel and not the dentists office - (at least not the ones I was use to in the past).

Glad a friend recommended this office!
Thanks Dr. Riar!!</Text>< pictures>

This is by far the most welcoming and comfortable dentist I have ever been to! Dr. Riar and his staff were fantastic and explained every step from beginning to end. They were very patient and did not rush through any steps although i was the last patient. Dr. Riar explained my treatment options with no pressure to agree on any unnecessary dental work! Overall fantastic experience, I highly recommend!< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Riar is the best dentist I have ever gone to in my life! I've never felt more confident that I'm getting the best dental care at Riar Dental Arts.

Dr. Riar is the friendliest and most professional dentist I've been around. He is extremely thorough and experienced - from the most common procedures to the complex, I know I'm always in great hands.

Additionally, I love the layout of the office - it has such a welcoming layout and design. Plus, it's equipped with all the best, state-of-the-art tools to make sure we all get the best care and service possible.

I can't say enough great things about Dr. Riar and his incredible team!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1467218089564, 'text': "Thanks Jonathan!

Dr Riar is amazing. He communicates clearly with his patients, is ALWAYS on time, and actually takes the time to talk to you. It’s unlike any other dentist I’ve dealt with before. Most doctors and dentists today (and I’ve been to several dentists locally) treat you like a paycheck or really anything but a person. Dr Riar remembers my kids’ names. He knows my favorite sports teams. He asks about my family.

AND he does great work and has a super helpful and friendly staff.

I cannot recommend his practice more. All around great experience.< /review>

<text>Dr. Riar did a phenomenal job with my titanium dental implant for a missing tooth.  The crown he inserted after the bone healed looks and feels incredibly natural. He explained the entire process in detail and answered every one of my questions thoroughly. In addition, the efficiency of the entire crowning process was highly appreciated as it only took about 30 minutes of my time. I highly recommend Dr. Riar and the warm Riar Dental Arts staff.<//text></record>

<Review>Great experience! For the first time ever, I will be scheduling my 6 month check ups every time!! Dr Riar and his staff are very friendly and easy to talk to (and MOST importantly, understand)! I liked that he is not pushy for unnecessary procedures. My husband, who needed much more extensive work, never felt a thing after or during his root canal and is also happy to be going back.

Highly recommended from a person who has visited at least 6 different local dentist offices!< /Review>< pics>

Hands down the best experience I've ever had at a Dental appointment. The staff is super friendly and very professional. I definitely will be going back again with my family from here on out! Highly recommend anybody to come give Dr. Riar and his staff a try if your looking for a new place and that truly takes care of their patients.<//Review>

Dr. Riar is great, his staff very professional and dental visits are a pleasant experience. I haven't had to wait long for any of my appointments, but there are some great magazines in the waiting room if I did! The office renovations have been nicely done,
especially the equipment upgrades. Definitely recommend Riar Dental!< /Text>

Dr. Riar is a very thorough, conscientious, professional dentist.  He replaced my friend/dentist Randy Jelmini who retired.  He is friendly and takes his time to get to know his clients.  I am so thrilled to have him as my dentist and have been singing his praises to everyone that I know.  He is honest and diligent and his staff are all friendly and accommodating.  I highly recommend him!< /text>

I am a new patient to the office. My first visit was a consult where I met Dr. Riar. He was very kind and explained my options clearly. The staff are very welcoming. I have been back to the office two othsr times now. Each time I have been greeted with smiles. My next visit I may be having a procedure. I don't like to post these scores until I have had a full experience. I'll report back on how things go with the next steps in my care. So far, I am very pleased.<//text>

I see Dr. Riar regularly and he takes great care of my teeth. I recently had my wisdom teeth removed, a procedure that I had been dreading because everyone tells you horror stories and how terrible it is going to be. That was not the case at all. Dr. Riar and his office staff made me feel completely comfortable and at ease. Everything was explained to me before it happened and I was totally comfortable the entire time. I would refer anyone to Riar Dental Arts for any dental work. The office is very clean and updated with the newest technology's and  everyone in the office is very friendly, polite, and professional.< /text>

What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Dr. Riar and staff are the best.  They provide top notch patient care.  Even when you have a not so good appointment "my lazy butt not doing what we have been taught to do since we were kids" you still walk out of the office with a good feeling,< /review>

Dr. Riar and his staff are amazing.  The office has been completely remodeled and it is BEAUTIFUL!!! The new procedure chair is extremely comfortable.  Dr. Riar's dental equipment is state of the art and brand new.  Every detail of his method is explained in an easy to understand manner.  Dr. Riar is young, and fresh out of school.  He uses the most up to date technique with extreme care.  He is a humble yet highly profession young man.  I recommend Dr. Riar and his staff with my highest personal statement.

I've been going to this office for around 20 years. When Dr. Riar took over the practice, I was concerned that the exceptional service would take a hit, but that hasn't been the case. The staff is friendly, we rarely (if ever) have to wait, and Dr. Riar makes a trip to the dentist as pleasant as possible. The renovations to the facility are great as well.< /review>

Dr Riar has a gentle touch and was very personable. I've been looking for a dentist for awhile now because of my high anxiety to dental work. Dr Riar was patient, explained everything and answered all my questions. He's also up to date with everything! Digital xrays which means less radiation and he takes pictures of everything to show me what needs to be done.< /Text>

Riar Dental Arts at 4801 Wilson Rd. #C Bakersfield, CA is a very professional and caring dental office.  Dr. Riar is a very kind and gentle person and ready to do what his patients want.  I needed his help and called him on a Sunday and he was there to assure me that I could show up at his office the next day without any appointment.  I am sure he would have asked me to go to his office if I asked which I didn't.  I did and got the work done and left very happy.  During routine visits, Dr. Riar is always very pleadant and friendly.  My family highly recommend Dr. Riar for your dental needs.  His office staff and technicians are also very knowledgeble and friendly.  Thank you Dr. Riar.<//Text>

For one thing I am scared of the Dentist.  However, with Dr. Rair he talks you through the process, at any time you need a break, he stops, lets you gather yourself together and when you are ready proceeds.

I would recommend Dr. Rair to anyone who needs a gentle touch.</text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I'm a graduate student. Needless to say, I haven't been to the dentist in a long time, and relied on my practices. When visiting home, I started to feel pain in the back of my jaw and knew I had to get it checked out. Friends referred me to Riar Dental Arts.

Setting up an appointment over the phone was easy, and they were able to see me very quickly. Now, I went in thinking it would be another sterile office, just in and out with some pain killers.

I was greeted very warmly by the staff, and sat down in what felt like a starship. There was so much tech! I geeked out, but in the process, learned much more about what was causing my pain with Dr. Riar's guidance. He walked me through what was going on, and what he was going to do about it, all while pointing to the digital x-rays in front of me. His confidence and knowledge was impressive, and he took the time to share that with me. I've never had an experience like that at a dentist. So, when is Dr. Riar opening up shop in Atlanta?<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1467218913742, 'text': "Chandresh- Thanks for this awesome review, we're so happy you came to see us.

It's a pleasure and an honor to serve the Bakersfield community and provide the best dentistry has to offer."}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80ea41da9f3fb1ad:0x2f9d547fc257f2ec< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I bought a screen protector here a year ago, and it broke while protecting the screen. I came back to get another and the clerk told me that while they no longer carried that brand, it's warranty provided replacement for just a shipping by charge, so I should go online to order it then bring it in for installation. I did as suggested, it came promptly, and the store installed it. Great service!</Review><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Lorena is so wonderful! Awesome customer service! She spent so much time trying to help and find something that worked for me, and I’m SO glad that she was able to help! She is always smiling and doesn’t make you feel like a burden, even when she spends hours helping you find something that works for you! She is so understanding, and she is great at her job, she knows the products, plans and if she doesn’t have an answer, she’ll find it for you! I have had multiple interactions with her, and I’m just now finding the time to write a review. This is the only AT&T store I've been to, I have no reason to go into any other. I also appreciate you always calling me back when you say you will! Your dedication is one of a kind! Thank you for all your hard work, knowledge and commitment to making your customers happy! And thank you for always being patient when my 5 year old comes in with me! ;) You’re a wonderful and professional employee here, and everyone else is great to, but you definitely stick out! :)<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>We had a quick and polite encounter with Joseph. We received a new screen protector for a cracked one. Joseph did not miss a beat taking off the old one and smoothing on the new one (I’ve always been impressed with how AT&T employees do this with ease!). Save the lines at Sierra Vista and on Blackstone and go to this store. Enjoy a Starbucks next door while you write your review.</Review><response>None< /response><Date>1576968973220< /Date>< UserId.>

I went to this location and I must say the experience I had was extremely amazing!!! Lorena was the one who assisted me and she did an exceptional job with meeting my needs. She made me feel comfortable with what I was purchasing and offered me the best deal. AT&T is privileged to have her represent their brand and she does it with such professionalism! She definitely is THE prime example of what excellent customer service is all about!!! I was planning on switching to a different carrier but she is the main reason why I stayed with AT&T. This type of customer service should not be overlooked and therefore I refer anyone to her to get what every customer deserves. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<//Text>

<Text>This review is not towards the store. This review is the cell service that is completely horrible. I switch from Verizon to AT&T for the cheaper service that was not going to break me. But like they say you go cheap you get Cheap. I have nothing but issues with drop calls & poor cell service. Connection to the internet is pretty sketchy as well. Now I have family members that have ATT service and they love it. But for me and my family we can’t stand it. So we have a year and half left in our contract to deal with the service. I’ve even called att about this but no help they can provide. So if you are reading this take my advice go with Verizon. It’s little bit more but a lot better service all together.
Sorry ATT you guys can’t come close to what Verizon has. Better cell and internet service.<//Text></record>

Lorena helped us today and gave exceptional customer service. We were looking to add a feature to our phone plan and she went to great lengths to make sure all of our questions were answered and we knew exactly what to expect. She spent a lot of time with us without hurrying us. Thank you Lorena!< /review>

Joseph was very helpful and although the error on my account was done at another at&t store he was more than willing to fix their error and keep me as a customer! Thank you for your help during this time!<//Review>

<UserId.>107850805936596349997< /UserId.><Review>I like this little store. They don't always have everything in stock but can order it or let you know if another store has what you are looking for. I like this because I have seen the same four employees there for a couple of years now. They are knowledgeable and NOT high pressure. They always solve my phone problems or help in some way.
A drawback is they share a small parking lot with a Starbucks so sometimes you have to park farther away.<//Review><Rating>4</Rating>< gmap_id>

Stopped in to purchase a charging cable and the employees demanded my phone number. I told them I'm not a customer and don't give my number out. I offered a generic number to move things along and Angel, who was incredibly rude, told me *I* had an attitude, took the cord and put it on the shelf and basically kicked me out of the store. I promptly went down the street and paid WAY too much for a cable so I could get my phone charged to report this absolutely unacceptable behavior. Angel needs to join the ranks of the unemployed or switch to a job where he has no interaction with customers. Steer CLEAR of this place.<//text>

We went into that location today so my husband could get a new sim card for the new phone he got because the sim card he had for his old phone didn't fit. He was helped by a girl named Yaritza she had NO idea what she was doing and couldn't get it to work after turning on his new phone she asked if it was a AT&T phone and it clearly stated it was AT&T ....SMH. She couldn't set it up so we left & when we got home my husband tried to make a phone call well she ended up turning off his phone completely and he called to let her know what she did & she told him there was nothing she could do and he would have to go in. She was extremely unprofessional and rude i wouldn't recommend dealing with her and she shouldn't be in customer service with that kind of attitude towards customers when she created the problem.< /review>

Long waits often despite being smaller store. Typically only 1-2 employees on site. Signed up for Directv almost 12 weeks ago and have yet to receive the promotional credit offer. Have had another issue with AT&T getting credit for lifeline home phone service.<//Text>

We called to ask how much it would be for a bath and a trim for our 50 pound chow. Was told about 50.00.
Made the appointment for 9:00am. Dropped our dog off at 9:00 and they said they would call us when he's done.
Never heard from them until my husband went over there about 3 and was told he still wasn't done. They called us at 4 to say he was done.
When we picked him up they charged us 85.00 but that wasn't the worst part.
He was SHAVED down to his skin!! This was supposed to be a trim!!! Then they shaved his back legs but left his front legs  long.
I don't know where these people got there training but they need to listen to there customer!!!< /review>

So many amazing features for one space. Dog grooming school, puppy training,  and they keep puppy while you and your family head out of town for a weekend get away. Perfect space for your little fur babies.< /Text>

They did a great job and were available on short (same day) notice.  They were not available for pickup as expected and communicated so the stay was one day longer. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.< /text>

Allen's is the best. We have never used another hotel. I was referred to this wonderful business by a co-worker and I actually travel more now because I am so confident in my pet's care and she loves this place more than our house I think haha. Awesome people who care and the prices are very reasonable.</review>

<review>Mollie must have enjoyed her stay.  When the attendant brought her out from the kennel, she didn't want to leave.  I paid for extra long walks, because she is use to walking and walking with me.  I will use Allen's Pet Resort again and again.  Allen's was recommended to me from other friends.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80900b338cc2535f:0x7a43d0e4fff3cbb7<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Text>The staff at Allen's Pet Resort is so very helpful and caring!  I had to find a new boarding facility this year after my former Vet/boarder retired and closed the practice  I found Allen's and I wish I had known them all along!  Huge facility, with lots of extra exercise optlions that you can add to your pet's stay. But even without "extras" your pet will be openly exercised individually in a large play area.  The kennels are very large with indoor/outdoor access.

This is a great Resort for pets and I guarantee you'll love the staff!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>My pup was excited to see me, and he was settled and tired which is exactly how I want to bring him home. He wasn't stressed and settled back at home very easily.  The staff kept me updated on how he was doing during his stay. I know now the next time he stays there he's in very good hands.

I felt they knew my pup.  We were in a pinch and had to leave him there for daycare.  Julianna gave us a report card and was spot on my puppy personality.  In the day was there I know his needs were met and good care.   The rates are reasonable and they offer 45 mins play time 30 min walk which is a plus for my high energy nervous whippet.  Thanks again Allen’s pet resort.<//Text>

< Review>
We drove from Texas to northern California for a wedding; the dogs had to be boarded while we were on site at the wedding. I was worried about finding a boarding facility relatively close by that I would trust with my two pups. Allen's Pet Resort was very friendly and responsive while booking the dogs' stay and it seemed like the dogs had a great time and were well cared for. I felt very comfortable leaving my dogs there.<//Review>

Friendly, professional and caring staff. I have used Allen's Pet Resort many times over the years and can't speak highly enough of the staff. Very clean and safe kennel out in farm and orchard country between Stockton and Lodi. Your beloved pet (s) will receive safe and caring boarding and services there.<//review>

<Text>Boarded my dog for a week while on vacation. Received no phone calls about any problems. My dog was skin and bones when I picked him up. It didn't look like he ate the entire time I was gone. I've worked at kennels, and we'd always call if a dog goes longer then 2 days not eating. Horrible experience and I'd NEVER recommend.<//Text>< pics>

I couldn't give this business enough praise if I tried. We are in a situation with our dogs where we are having to keep them in a boarding place for a long period of time, and the people at Allen's Pet Resort have been so helpful and understanding.  I can really tell that everyone who works there cares about the animals they are taking care of.  When I call to check up on our dogs, the people know my dogs by name , and can tell me specific details about how my dogs are doing.  Everyone is just so caring, you can tell that they love working there.  I have been to 2 other boarding places in the area, and I didn't have good experiences at either one.  I'm not taking my dogs to anywhere else but Allen's Pet Resort.</text>

I have been using Allen's Pet Resort since early 2000.  I have had nothing but wonderful service and loving care for my animals.  I have a special needs cat and feel very comfortable leaving his at the "spa".  I know they care.</Review>

I would highly recommend Allen's Pet Resort to all of my friends and family!! We have been using this kennel for 6yrs now. We've never had any problems and our pets are always happy when we drop off and pick up. #weloveallenspetresort ❤ 🐕 🐕 🐕

<Review>Lines may be long due to staff shortages however Beverly and the other elderly Indian woman (I Wish i knew her name) are very kind and welcoming. However a new employee has arrived and boy does she need an attitude adjustment and more training. I went to get a receipt for my already paid for shipping labels (packages) like I always do. My first time seeing this new woman she tells me no I cannot get a receipt, it is passport day, and that I need to try a different branch. I get back in line in hopes of seeing the Indian woman who always serves me and she told me completely different from what the New Girl said. I honestly felt like the new girl just didn't want to work.</Review>< pictures>

The office was a little crowded. The line was long specially for the 6 feet distance. It's a nice building, clean and organized. When I arrived to the window the lady welcome me with a smile! I had some questions and she patiently helped me. She was pretty helpful and friendly even when she was having a busy day!<//text>

This postal service office is great! The women here are very helpful with each question and are very knowledgeable about shipping. They have boxes out and ready to go if you just grab them off of the shelf. This is a very convenient postal office for me and they usually have two workers in here working at a time so the line does go through quickly. I ship things through ebay here and they have done a great shipping standard!</review>

Worst post office! I tried to call this office, I was directed to the 800 number.  Call the numbe4 and then was given this post office number that should of been listed in the first place.  Once I call, no one answered and instead of leaving a message the phone hangs up after ringing a few times. Was supposed to deliver a package but attempted one time to delivery. The same day the post office sent my package back. Not letting even get the chance to go pick it up! Trash trash trash. I have several packages I'm sending out. But it won't be through this horrible branch or the post office in general!!!<//Text>

I don't generally write bad reviews but wow staff has a serious attitude problem. Didn't get her name but I'm sure if you visit this place you'll know who I'm talking about. Personality was disgusting. I'd rather walk to where my package is being sent out to than visit this place again.< /review>

<review>Customer service is horrible! I have a paid stamp envelope that needed to be in a location in two days and i needed tracking. She refused service because it was a paid stamp. I asked for a recommendation of what I can do to track the package and said no, after asking questions she said that It’s $26 to send it, I asked if I can put a stamp and she said I can’t put a stamp over it I have to get an envelope and she doesn’t know which one I’m going to get. I’m not about to stand there not knowing which envelope to choose and touching everything with this pandemic.
They lady that helped me was a short African American lady horrible attitude !!!!!!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>Erica Arroyo<//user_name><user>109175914431645022223</user>< Response>

I give it a 2 because the clerk's at the window are extremely nice and polite but the service of the USPS for this area is terrible in general. Sometimes I go 2 weeks with out any mail. I constantly get other people's mail in my box and even worse the delivery post worker leaves my mail on top of the building box which is extremely irresponsible giving that it's a bad building in a bad neighbor hood.On top of which they take no responsibility for your mail when go to the office to find it. There only statement is if you don't have a tracking number there's nothing you can do. So how am I supposed to get a tracking number from the DMV, gas company , DWP ect. . I can't blame the postal workers they work extremely long hours, are over worked and under appreciated. They hire people the same as a temp agency does for warehouse's but make you go through a 2-3month hiring process only to put you on as a Temp worker. It's sad. I'll be glad when they finally do go out of business as many have said they eventually will they are nothing but an unreliable  hassle.<//review>

Why are some people so lazy, inconsiderate, and rude with no morality? What did or did not happen in these people’s lives that made them think it's okay to be like this? Go to another post office.😤</review>

Due to Covid-19 Only just be aware that lines can be long and if you have things to do afternoon and before closing is longest sorry. They close exactly on time so if walking make sure you are way ahead of their closing hours.< /review>

The women  behind the glass at this post office on Van Ness & Century are the most rudeness customer service reps I have ever seen.
Especially the one on the far left in those black framed glasses. They scare me....< /Review>

The best post office ever ! They always have a ton of staff on hand that are very nice and patience with you. The line moves somewhat fast and you'll be out in less than 15 minutes. Every one of my packages send out on time or even the day of ! I've have nothing but good experiences with this post office and would definitely recommend this place if you want fast and reliable service !</Review>

Staff members are EXTREMELY rude to me everytime I have gone in to this location. Staff members have gossiped about me infront of my face, have been condescending & felt entitled to make comments about my race/ethnicity. Management refuses to do anything to correct their staff's behavior, so I decided to go to another location. EVERY staff member at this location, including management should be FIRED pronto & replaced with people that actually know how to give good customer service.<//review>

I have now been on the phone for over 1 hour, photo for reference, the update said my package was attempted to be delivered and will be returned to sender. This location is in LA and I live in Las Vegas so the website said with this issue call so I did it said "36-50 minute wait" my first thought was that's ridiculous and can't be right so I'll just wait. Well its now been 1 hour and 5 mins and they're closing in 15 so I just wasted all that time for nothing and still don't know where my package is...

Fedex is always so much more expensive so I use USPS but I thought the extra money is far more worth actually getting to speak to someone.

update at 1:10 someone did pick up she was helpful so I added and extra star. She filled out a report for me but I still think that the amount of wait time is really unacceptable.<//text>

<text>I have been to this post office several times and have generally had a good experience. My friend had a package shipped to my address, but the shipping label was incorrect, so the package was kept at the post office for being "undeliverable". The day my friend went to pick-up the package she was helped by the supervisor working that day and was told it could not be located, but she would be notified when it was found. The next day she was notified the package was found and ready to be picked up and when she went to the post office she was instantly met by a different employee with a bad attitude who told her she couldn't pick-up the package because the resident at the address it was delivered to said she didn't live there, which is not true because no one ever contacted me about anything. What happened was they probably spoke to the person who lived at the address on the shipping label which was wrong in the first place and that person said they didn't know my friend. Anyway, after chastizing my friend for no reason the post office worker finally handed over the package and acted as if she was doing my friend a favor by giving it to her, which was unacceptable behavior and completely unprofessional.<//text>< pictures>

As soon as my daughter and I walked in she shouted out CHICKEN CHEETO SANDWICH!!! So to make a long story short... it's greasy Must.Love.Cheetos.  I wasn't impressed and to my surprise neither was my daughter. I would only recommend this to someone who wants to try a Cheeto chicken sandwich and could care less how it tastes. Lololol</review>

I always get fast service when I go to this location. I'm very happy to see it's open late in a city where a lot of things close early. I wish their online system allowed you to customize your meals more and change out the sides. Some people don't want 3 orders of mashed potatoes.<//review>

Today's chicken was some of the best I've jaff on a long time. All the pieces were hot and not over heated or dried out like at some other places I've been to. I was treated like a paying customer and not a bum.<//Text>

Where can you get fried chicken and tacos? Here at KFC and Taco Bell split restaurant. This has to be the smallest one I have ever seen. Employee moral seems low from just the small size of this place.</Review>< pictures>

You can easily spend $20 for 3 people here and it is not very fast.  There was only 1 person in the kitchen when we we're there.  There are much better options.< /review>

Fresh organic produce is guaranteed at affordable prices. Wish they had more stalls though.</review>

<Review>Thursday Farmers market in North Long Beach.  Even in winter, a reasonable assortment of vegetables and fruits available, given the California climate.   Covid has taken a toll on food to go.<//Review></record>

<review>This is my first time visiting this Thursday afternoon Farmers Market since the COVID Pandemic Quarantine.

I like the that they have the Guidelines in place. One seller (Asian stall) spelling fresh veggies they won't allow you to touch. You tell them want you want and they will get it for you. Also Social Distance Guidelines in place so you have to wait in line.

The other vendors, you can't touch the fruits, however they will give you a plastic glove so you can pick your fruits.

Four Stars since not a loy of varieties of vendors, mostly the stalls sells same thing. I wish they have more food stalls.</review><Name>Russ Lacuata<//Name><user>103464758035032588945</user><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

Great deals on really fresh produce and specialty items like dates and honey! Your typical farmers market items are available here from very friendly vendors! Small farmers market but they have everything you are looking for, very convenient!! Highly recommend stopping by here! 👍< /review>

I've gone to many farmers markets and this is one of the few who sell good quality food that isn't old or dirty. All the veggies look fresh and delicious, this place has more than just veggies, there's also entertainment and delicious food trucks. This farmers market accepts ebt, you just have to go to the main stand to exchange your money to the coins or colorful paper that theyll give you.<//review>

Its a very nice looking shop but the customer service here needs a lot of improvement. Sometimes it's just okay then other times they act disappointed a customer walked in, like you might rob the place, or like they are counting the minutes until you leave. Overall, it's just not a welcoming atmosphere here. There is no customer/vendor relationship building. You can spend money here a dozen times, being helped by the same people, and the next time you come in they still have a paranoid, snobby, just give us your money and leave attitude. So I rarely go here anymore. I started driving all the way to the Temecula Old Town Coin Shop. Now everyone there knows me by name and seem genuinely happy a customer returned when I walk through the door.</Review>

{'time': 1584667025389, 'text': "I apologize, but there is not much we can do. The premiums are extremely high because the wholesalers are out of silver. If you shop around, you will find most sellers, including large companies, do not have any silver in stock at all. Although the cost to purchase silver is very high, we are also paying considerably over silver spot for your items if you would like to sell. Yesterday, we offered someone $15,000 for $12,000 of silver. If you would like to sell yours at $3-4 over silver, give us a call, because we are buying.\n\nThe last time I saw this situation, silver premiums were $8 over silver spot and it lasted for 6 months. I hope it doesn't get that bad this time.\n\nI truly hope you will remain a customer, and can understand that we are not trying to take advantage of anyone. Silver spot is not an indicator of it's trading value right now.\n\nBy the way, we have local competitors that were charging $10 over spot a few days ago, and they didn't have much left in stock. Our prices were lower then, and still are.\n\nI made this response 6 hours ago, but I am making an edit now to provide a link. Here is the proof that we are not gouging, and that it is the going rate: https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/there-s-an-interesting-situation-playing-out-in-the-silver-markets-15268913\n\nJust an update as of July 17, 2020. Premiums have come down quite a bit. Generic silver is back to the $3-4 over spot range. Not as good as it will be eventually, but quite a bit better than it was a few months ago."}< /Response>

I give this place a 2. I brought in a 1 oz gold bar a week ago and they gave me 40 below spot which is not good but not bad I guess. But they cut it in half and I asked if they do this to all coins as well and they do. So if you have precious gold coins that you care about I wouldn’t take it here because they are likely to cut it in half. Take your gold coins to somewhere that they have the knowledge to know what they are looking before your they cut your coins in half<//Text>

The three people behind the counter are helpful but extremely arrogant. They will offer you pennies at best regardless of what you bring to them to sell or pawn. They are extremely picky but if you do happen to have something they want chances are you would get much more elsewhere. For a place that specializes in gold they have a habit of turning you away. Brought in a 1860s railroad pocket wstch made of 18k gf and they woulfnt even make an offer for scrap.</text>

<review>I called about and old penny collection that I have had for 50 years and asked if he could evaluate it for me. He was very courteous on the phone and in person. He did let me know after taking a careful look at my collection that I had doubled my money over the past 5 decades! That’s a pretty good return! Haha. I should have collected hundred dollar bills instead.
At any rate if I need anything again. I’ll know who to call. Thanks Brandon.

Took my buddy here for his first Korean BBQ experience, and it did not disappoint! The all-you-can-eat lunch came with the 5 or 6 standard meats (bul go gee, LA short ribs, pork belly, etc.), all the usual sides, rice, salad, AND hot pot. Honestly, I could have done without the hot pot, but I know some people are into that. Interesting bathroom art as well. Definitely worth checking out.</Text>

<review>This place is a hidden secret. $23 for all you can eat hotpot and grilled bbq. Pretty good quality for the price. Also you get to see these huge paintings the owner painted herself. She told me it took her only 2 hours each. Come visit this family owned restaurant.</review>< Pics>

All you can eat for hot pot and Korean BBQ! The hot pot is really great but a little salty. For BBQ, we had 6 kinds of meat, but quality of meat is soso. It is located in the downtown Mountain View.</review>

<Review>Food is really good. Staff is amazing and attentive. Feels like a mom and pop restaurant and I really enjoy this vibe. It’s well located on Castro Ave, all you can eat is cheap and they provide as much as you want. Even when we don’t come eat here we order through a delivery app and it’s just as delicious (unluckily for us, it’s not all you can eat at home hah!). You’re definitely gonna enjoy when you come.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Five stars for the food. Fantastic bulgogi.  Have to withhold a star for service.  It's nice and genuine and courteous, but can be slow.  I've seen it fairly busy in there a few times while one waitress rushes around and tables are waiting for food and service.  Fifth Star though for sure if they hire some more wait staff, this is a great food option on Castro Street.< /Text>< Pics>

Don't understand why it got 4+stars. Bad food.
My daughter and I ate there last night. We were the only party most of time.

We got poisoned by the food. I submitted a complaint to the country.
We both threw up several times. I got diarrhea too. My belly is still hurting at this moment. My whole body hurts<//review>

<text>Enjoyed this place a lot! The waitress was nice and friendly as well. We came in a group of 6 from out of town for a business trip. We did the all you can eat Korean BBQ and it was well worth!

The boss lady took care of us a lot like a mom and made us feel warm & welcomed. Love the vibe here! We ordered all you can eat and it comes with a big hotpot and all kinds of meat i.e. marinated pork, marinated chicken, galbi, beef brisket(my favourite), bulgogi.

<Review>Service was poor - we asked some questions about how to eat their food (I had never tried Korean hot pot) and were treated rudely. We ordered the combination dumpling hot pot. The portion was generous but the taste was just ok.< /Review>< GmapID>

Very helpful waitress, food was good, cooked at the table and way too much food for two people. Waitress barely spoke English and could not help us with a dinner selection other than pointing out items on the menu. It was a good dinner all in all. A bit on the pricey side but you will not leave hungry.</review>

Obviously you don't go to a Korean BBQ place for vegan food, yet I was positively surprised by the 2-3 vegan options on their menu. They also offered to remove the egg from one of their vegetarian dishes.</Review>

I really wanted to like this place, since the staff was quite friendly.  But the beef in my dolsot bibimbap was pretty tough and chewy.  I think this might be the only Korean place in downtown Mountain View, so if you just have to get some, then it should be fine.  But there are better places elsewhere.<//text>

Food was great but service a little shoddy. We had nothing to drink the entire meal. Finally we got water just before the check came.

We got the two meat combo with Galbi and beef Bulgogi and it was delightful! The Galbi had a subtle ginger kick that really worked well. The combo is a gut buster for any two people. It's probably best for three if the have a hearty appetite or even four if nobody wants to pig out.<//Review>

<review>For all you can eat, there is about six options for meat. However, they bring out all the meat without you even asking for it (e.g. chicken and marinated pork) and you're obliged to finish it. Also not a lot of side dishes.<//review>< pics>

The meat is way too salty and sweet. All the food they provide are increase your chances of getting cancer. When I asked fresh meat from them, they said they can not serve good quality meat with $23. Pfffff<//Review>

not a traditional ayce restaurant, they pick the dishes for you (which includes lot of cheap fillers), but you can keep getting more.

Sorely disappointed by the meat quality

This is a place without trust. In the phone call I asked three times I am one person for buffet and they said yes. However when I arrived they insisted two people minimum. Yes, a place without trust.< /review>

<name>吳世傑<//name><Review>(Translated by Google) There are hot pots and barbecues that are full. It's a good deal for 23 people. It's okay! Come eaten up this time ...
Especially the cured meat is super delicious! Can be more ...

<Review>Dr. Todd and Dr. Jamie are amazing. I came here yesterday with a sudden very painful injury and they've taken great care of me so far. They are very informative and personable. I am totally new to chiropractic care and am happy and comforted that they explain what they're doing as they do it. I will definitely be coming back here for any future chiropractic needs.< /Review><time>1602447506526<//time>< resp>

I walked into the Joint on beach Boulevard in kinda bad shape and filled  out the questionnaire. Todd talk to me and ask me questions and gave me his thoughts on on my condition. Todd is very knowledgeable and helped me understand my back and challenges. When I walk out I feel considerably better mentally and physically. The back is the main frame of the body<//Text>

<text>Dr. Todd Cunningham gives excellent adjustments. He goes the extra mile by adjusting your legs and shoulders. He gave me some good advice on surfing as well and how stretching helps prevent injury. Highly recommend this location.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd26593a01af59:0xa0ade7d14a4c96b0< /gmap_id></record>

I have alot of back/sciatica issues which are so debilitating to say the least. I am from the UK and  now living in Orange County. I used to see a Chiropractor  before and started to search for one here as I was in so much pain which causes me to feel very depressed.  After searching for a Chiropractor I found  The joint  Chiropractic. The girl on reception was so nice. I filled out all the paperwork then had my first session with Dr.Todd. He asked many questions about my situation then started to do his magic. I felt so relieved that finally my pains would disappear  after so long. I went back a few times a week which as suggested and was feeling such relief after my adjustments. Then Covid  came so I didn't go back for a while and then all the pain returned. So with mask on  I'm going back and look forward to it so much.
Thank you Dr. Todd 😊</Text>

<user_name>Kimmie Q.< /user_name><Time>1571099064996<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>My daughter has been seeing both Dr Todd and Dr Jamie and she loves them both. Both genuinely shows great interests in her well being. Dr Todd has been seeing my daughter the most and I can’t tell you how wonderful he is. He’ll make her feel super comfortable by having a small chat with her, he’ll then tell her what he’ll be doing before doing it and best of all....he’s like a parent engaging in a conversation with his own child asking her how her day was, what she’s been doing and etc. While I’m sitting there watching and listening to their conversations with a big smile on my face. Dr Todd is not only a great Dr, he is also a great person overall in my book. Dr Jamie as well. I don’t think anyone can go wrong if they get one or the other Dr.
There is this one gentleman that sits at the front desk, his name is Dan. Dan has a wonderful smile and is always happy when we walk in the door. He’ll have small conversations with us and ALWAYS have a nice warm smile. When we’re done, he’ll say bye to us and will greet us off so warmly and so nicely. Overall, the office environment is so nice and warm when Dan is around. 👍🏼
I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who needs a correction to fix whatever pain they’re in. My daughter before coming here was in so much pain that a 15 yrs old like her shouldn’t be in. Due to “The Joint” and their affordability, I’m able to take her in 4x’s a month and she feels so good and now she’s a happy and tired 15yrs old with minimal to no pain. Happiness is due to them, tiredness; well, they can’t help her with that. 😊</Review>< Pictures>

Great experience, affordable and fixed my thrown out back. Will have a more detailed review after a full nights rest. For $29 the adjustment was well worth it. Instantly felt way better. Initially there was so much pain while trying to stand up or even walk just a few steps. I can now walk with very minor pain, standing up is a breeze. I know I am only 26 but going to the chiropractor every month might be something I start doing to maintain a healthly spine and overall body.< /Text>

For someone that hates massages and just in general doctors . This place is amazing I have been dealing with some bad back pain and Dr. Tod was very helpful in explaining everything and also making me feel comfortable. After my visit I had awesome results the pain was almost completely gone and my neck felt a huge relief. Thank you and can’t wait to come back in a few days .< /text>

I am very picky as to who I let work on me. In fact I went close to a year because my Chiropractor of over 15 years was simply too far away. [I moved to HB]

So I decided to give this "Joint" a try. Well after just 1 visit to the Huntington Beach location, I found my new Chiropractor!

The location is convenient, freeway close and both the staff and the Doctors are AMAZING!

Give The Joint Chiropractic a try. The only thing you gotta lose is that pain that's been messing up your life!

Do yourself a solid and sign up for the monthly program. Unless of course your health and comfort is not worth a few dollars a month.< /text>< Pics>

I have been a member of The Joint Chiropractics for 3 years. I have experienced the wellness of being consistently treated at many of their locations. I have a chronic elbow issue that Dr Todd treats exceptionally well. His knowledge and understanding of the smaller joints, such as my elbow, is outstanding. As I continue to live an active lifestyle, I am grateful for Dr Todd and his ability to keep me pain free.</Review>

<text>I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! I started coming here when I found out I was pregnant. Dr. Todd did a great job of adjusting my neck and back all throughout my pregnancy and keeping me as pain-free as possible. He also gave me excellent tips of what I could do at home to keep things on track. I kept coming right up until my due date. In fact, Dr. Todd adjusted me the day before I gave birth! He always works with you to accommodate whatever you may have going on. Even though my last few months of adjustments were done with me on my side and back it left me feeling great!!! So thankful for the good work they do here. Plus the joint makes chiropractic care affordable for those whose insurance doesn't cover it.</text>< pictures>

I have been going to Chiropractic for about the last 15 years. Dr Todd is amazing, and always takes care of my very sensitive neck that, when out of alignment, causes me major migraines. He has a funny but professional sense of humor that always makes me look forward to my visit. He really helps me keep my head on straight ;)<//review>

This is my favorite of the Joints in area. Dr. Todd is amazing. He always remembers me and my needs. I always feel better when I leave, and coming here has left lasting impressions to correct my historically injured spine. The staff is always friendly, too. I don't know where I would be without this place.</Review>

They mainly consist of two of the same chiropractors that talk to you (i mean give u advice too) for the duration of your visit 5-10 minutes for the crackling.  But i can see the effort they make to have it feel unrushed where they'd extend the talk/treatment for u even when ur rdy to go out the door and already walking towards the exit 😆.  Today i told my chiro (theres a male and female who are both knowledgable and like... talk to u and give u info like ur in a classroom) that i was getting a lil burnt out and he responded, among other things that its ok to be selfish and tend to yourself, which is already in a way what im already doing by being "here" at the joint.  I was like.  Oh man hes right 😆.  Go me???  Other times hed say things like...my back and my muscle and my shoulders and stuff like that which is kind of boring to read about in a review, in a way lol.  And actually you know what.  You can prod him and her for info and you dont have to go to school for it, which is a nice perk for me.  Im always working with my hands and its nice to streamline my particular conditioning with the correct and trusted answers they provide without doing the work to research it 😆.

Now i work with better form and know how to stretch and stuff to better my understanding intimately for my job, which puts me at an advantage compared to others at my workplace.

Thank you @the joint chiropractic.  The particular people you have chosen for this location are very valuable to me.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dd26593a01af59:0xa0ade7d14a4c96b0< /gmap_id><response>None<//response><pics>None</pics>< userid>

I called this location at 3:45pm to ask if they can help with my back issue Dan explained that they can help me for $29 which sounds like a steal I advise I would head over I got here at 4:02pm and he decides to look at me and say they are closing at 5:00pm and wouldn’t have time.. next time don’t make people drive to you and still after one hour of being open you can’t help me!! It irritates me when workers decided to decline service just to get out on time!!! Would not recommend</Text>

Dr. Todd is very professional, while still maintaining a great sense of humor. I have gotten migraines from the time I was about 10, and I started seeing a chiropractor around that time. I'm always picky about who works on my neck and when I found the joint I wasn't sure whether I was going to find anyone I would like or not, but dr. Todd does a great job! Highly recommend him whether you new to chiropractic or have been going for years.<//review>

<Text>It’s a great place to eat delicious homestyle Asian food. They have a good variety on the menu to savor your taste buds. Choose from an appetizer, main dish, soup, or desserts. Ask if you are unsure of the different menu items and they are very helpful in selecting something to fit your taste.

This is a locally owned restaurant ran buy a nice young couple. Come get some good food and support the local business.<//Text><name>Doua Moua< /name><UserId.>110830713559440882797</UserId.></record>

I ordered for take out and the food was warm when I got it. The serving size is so small for the price. I was missing a rice and the prawns were nasty. The prawns were more like sushi not how I imagined.< /Text>

First timer, ordered the kaopoon and some egg rolls to go. Right off the bat, I was bummed I can't dine in right now because even "to go" they clearly took time to think about a little presentation. Every bite of everything I had was fantastic. The sauces were great, and it might be a weird thing to mention but in this day of takeout, packaging matters! Nothing spilled on the way home even though I had a coconut-based curry liquid.
The call to order was cheerful and helpful, and the check out professional but personal.
This is one of those neighborhood places that need business in these tough times. This one is now on my list.👍<//Text>

<text>Friendly and Welcoming customer service, good food, the atmosphere just feels good there. I encourage all who have not tried to taste and see for yourself.  I most definitely would go back and try something else of the menu.< /text>< user_id>

Ordered the kimchi fried rice ($15). Was excellent. Large portion size. A little on the pricy side. Maybe offer one without shrimp for $11-12. Came with 4 large shrimp as well as another meat (pork?). The fried egg on top was made right with the yolk runny. Service needs some work as server forgot water but owner came over and he grabbed it for me. No one came by for a long time to refill water or ask if I needed anything which I let the owner know at the end. Despite going to the table across from me 5 times they never turned around to glance over or check on me. Something I think will improve over time. Also the ambiance is good. I look forward to trying other items on the menu and will recommend to friends.<//Text>

I had really high hopes for this place, but was very disappointed. Overpriced for a small portion of Korean short ribs (but large portion of rice) with terrible flavor and texture. My wife had the chili pork wontons but they forgot the chili at first, and even after I went back in to get it the flavor was very lacking. The skin was undercooked but the pork was overcooked.

They seem to be nice people and are adding something different to Redding, so I hope we just happened to come on a bad day and they continue to work on getting the flavors right.< /text>

< Review>
There are a lot of really good restaurants in Redding so we are quite fortunate. Just recently I learned of a new place called The Rustic Table.  Let me just tell you, AMAZING! Every. Single. Thing. was fantastic!! The service was spot on.  The food was so good, I went back three days later so I could share it with new friends!! It is a small place, two story dining area, nicely decorated for the most part.... but the food... the food is simply wonderful!!<//Review>

Totally lives up to all the great ratings! Such a surprise to find this incredible gem in Redding on our way to Sacramento. We had the wings and kimchee fried rice and loved, loved, loved every single umami mouthful! Highly recommend this place even if you’re even close to Redding—-it’s  absolutely worth the trip!< /Review>

< Review>
We needed a guaranteed COVID nucleic acid amplification test for Kauai within 72 hours of takeoff. Very efficient testing site. Staff was very nice and kept people moving through. We tested on a Saturday at 10:15am, and had results by 10:15pm. This gave us plenty of time to upload results. Also gave me peace of mind, since many places can not guarantee results in 72 hours. They have you do the swab yourself, not very far into your nose. We drove an hour to Oakland, but it was worth it.<//Review>

Due to a weird travel plan, I needed a quick option for a rapid covid test. CityHealth was an affordable and convenient option. I ended up not needing the test, but CityHealth made it easy for me to cancel my appointment without hassle. Thanks for making life easy for anyone trying to travel.</Review>

The staff at Oakland Airport (Devi) was so informative and went over and beyond by rescheduling my parties appointments with 72hrs at a location closer to our home. Also, the staff At Dublin were amazing as well. They were all very pleasant and informative and efficient! Thank you City Health< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<review>The technicians were very professional, polite, courteous and friendly.  They engaged us in conversation regarding our travel plans that answered their required questions, and at the same time made it enjoyable.  They provided clear and understandable instructions that guided us in taking the "nasal swab culture.  My daughters (who were in a panic state prior to the test) applauded the entire procedure!

Thank You!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The site I was registered to test was at the Sac International Airport. It was easy to find because of their tents, but didn’t there were no signs until just around the corner—Google maps takes you one way and then corrects itself once you start using you head back toward the road where you see the tents.

Once you’re there, it went smoothly. Even with short lines, it took time but it’s okay since I did have the time. You sit in your car the whole way through while staff come to your window to service you.

The staff were dry, thorough and gave clear instructions on how the test would be administered, and how the results would be received and what I would have to do with it when I receive it.

Thank you for a great experience.</Text>

Everyone was very professional and very friendly . I am very happy that I found this organization. They actually listen to you and respond to every question you have. I really enjoyed how they made me feel very relaxed. Its such a relief to find an organization that actually treats you as a person and not as a number or dollar sigh. Two Thumbs Up for CityHealth.!<//Review>

Fast, friendly, and had results in under 24 hours!  Website was easy to negotiate and the needed information (type of test, trusted travel partner, etc. ) clearly indicated. I’m giving them a solid A. I went to the SF downtown location (Jessie St. ). Parking nearby or take your chances on the street. You can’t turn onto Jessie because the test site is actually in the street.</Text>

<review>The signage for waiting could be improved since patients were approaching the site from different directions.  It would also have helped to have a dedicated "starter" but at least when I was there all of the patients were, well, patient and considerate.  The whole process only took about 15 minutes.<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><user_id>115701156399475048878< /user_id>< Response>

Was very easy to make the appointment for the Covid test prior to my trip to Hawaii. Booked the appointment 3 days in advance to make sure there was enough time to get the results and once we got to the appointment it went very fast. No long lines and for they were very thorough with checking IDs and validating that all information was correct. Found out it was a self swabbed test which was a first for me since I was used to getting it done from the medical assistants. So it turned out to be a fun experience for all of us in the car since we had 3 adults and 2 kids to swab.. lol
Got out results in by the end of the day! Impressed and I will definitely use this service again for my next trip!</Review>

< Review>
I initially had issues with booking an appointment as the website was experiencing issues and it was very difficult to get a hold of someone. I called several times a day for about 4 days until I was able to speak to someone about some questions I had. I was finally able to book an appointment at the El Cerrito location for a Covid test for Hawaii travel. Once I was there the process was very quick, staff was friendly and I received results 15 hours after testing!<//Review>

<Text>I was completely stressed out about getting the test back in time. Stressed out because what if my husband got stuck at work and couldn't make his scheduled appointment. In the end everything worked out perfect. My husband did get stuck at work and through the Chat online they were able to change his appointment that morning for him. We all got our results back in only a few hours and uploading everything for our trip to Hawaii was easy.<//Text>< username>

Competent, safe, nice people working there. The only gripe: Hawaiian Airlines knew me as- full name including middle name- whereas the uploaded covid report from CityHealth named me as-first name, last name only. This caused  Hawaiian Secure Travels to disapprove my upload. Calls to Hawaiian were horrid. I waited multiple hours at a time before hanging up. Apparently the name mismatch is a glitch in their system. Still it might be best, for your clients, to include "What name will be on your flight ticket's?"  on the list of questions asked at the covid testing site. Thank you for letting me vent!</text>

This drive thru clinic had fast, friendly people to assist you in the whole testing process.  They answered all of our questions, and overall, the experience was MUCH better than I expected.  They are organized and efficient.  And to be clear, this is the City Clinic set up near the Sacramento Airport.< /review>

Covid testing prior to Hawaii trip- drive thru at their Dublin location was easy to locate and super easy. Self swab. Said PCR results would be available in 48 hours (not rapid testing) but had results 13 hours later!! $20 per person!<//Text>

<Text>Got my Covid test for Hawaii travel at their San Jose airport testing location, and received results within 12 hours. With insurance card,  I only paid $20.
I was able to book appointment ahead  of time, and was able to reschedule as well.  Their contact information on their Facebook page with email and direct phone number.  I arrived the testing site around 11am, right before long lines during lunch time.<//Text>< pics>

The staff members were all professional and friendly. I arrived there about 15 minutes early, but I did not have to wait at all. The test site was outside, and no need to worry about being too crowded. The result came in at 1AM of the same day as a text message link!< /Review>

<user_name>Jemima Kiss<//user_name><text>We spent hours looking for somewhere to get covid tests to meet travel requirements for the UK. Not only was there no support from our airline or Kaiser, but there was confusing and non-specific information from the British government about which tests and at what sensitivity.

Google searches turned up places that quoted $200, $300 and even $400 - per one-hour PCR test - which for the four of US, with three lots of UK testing once we arrived was approaching the cost of the flights themselves. A CVS appointment, for which I took the morning off work and drove for half an hour each way with two small children, turned me away because I’d booked “the wrong kind of appointment” with completely unsympathetic staff.

Luckily a friend mentioned City Health, who had next-day appointments for travel-approved test at no cost, and right in the city rather than down at SFO. Staff were extremely efficient, had lots of safety precautions and were very helpful. The only thing that would’ve made it better would be if they were findable on Google!

Test before noon and you get the results by 2pm next day. Superb service for the city, thank you.<//text><Date>1623461679513</Date>< Response>

The employees/health workers were very friendly and kind, moving at a great pace for my family to get our day going. Also helps that I forgot my identification and health card, but they accepted my digital photos of both without complaint.< /text>

<Time>1623461679513</Time><review>We spent hours looking for somewhere to get covid tests to meet travel requirements for the UK. Not only was there no support from our airline or Kaiser, but there was confusing and non-specific information from the British government about which tests and at what sensitivity.

Google searches turned up places that quoted $200, $300 and even $400 - per one-hour PCR test - which for the four of US, with three lots of UK testing once we arrived was approaching the cost of the flights themselves. A CVS appointment, for which I took the morning off work and drove for half an hour each way with two small children, turned me away because I’d booked “the wrong kind of appointment” with completely unsympathetic staff.

Luckily a friend mentioned City Health, who had next-day appointments for travel-approved test at no cost, and right in the city rather than down at SFO. Staff were extremely efficient, had lots of safety precautions and were very helpful. The only thing that would’ve made it better would be if they were findable on Google!

Test before noon and you get the results by 2pm next day. Superb service for the city, thank you.< /review>< rating>

It was CityHealth San Jose, not Oakland. The wait was a little long because I guess many people are going to Hawaii. Everyone was very friendly and efficient. We will definite go back should we need the service again.</text>

<Review>Quick, clear, and easy! Got my results the same day, within hours. Simple drive thru, self-administered nose swab. Very nice and helpful staff. Results were texted to me by a 209 number saying San Bruno Kinetics with a link to gorillahealth which I thought was spam so I  deleted it, but luckily they sent an email too. So look out for that—it isn’t spam!< /Review>< pics>

I was surprised and grateful that the testing was drive-thru. And the nurse that handled my 4 year olds testing was amazing and getting her to feel she’s in charge and that swabbing her nose was no big deal. And my results were in by 7 am the next morning— test was at 2 pm. Highly recommend.<//Text>

The medical team were all welcoming, efficient and professional. It was easy to park in a loading zone, go through check-in snd out again. Got results within 12 hours.< /Text>

<review>The only problem I have is that they say the testing is free but then there is a $20 "service" fee. So it's not free and for a service fee $20 is excessive.< /review>< time>

Complaint!!!My disappointment is I was not able to pick up my prescription at Walgreen's. This was because whoever sent prescription did not pay attention to detail. Sharon said my prescription would be ready in 30 minutes. Walgreen's had my birth date wrong. My birthday is in October not February. I presented my identification two times at your office. I was quite disappointed because I really needed to start medication to treat what I came to Urgent Care for. Kind of takes away from the concept if I can't get what I need. I am still in pain and discomfort. I was not able to sleep at all last night. My face is still swollen and skin was inflamed. I called around 3:30 to explain my birth date was incorrect. I requested  for someone to call Walgreen's. Around 5:30, a man called to confirm my birth date. He did not like me asking why did this happen? He seemed not to care very much about my concerns. He told me Walgreen's will send me a text. Did not hear from Walgreen's. Called the pharmacy at 8:30 and they did not have my subscription ready. It is 6:30 in the morning now. I request the prescription to be sent this morning to Walgreen's first thing this morning. I need to start treatment immediately. Don't know if anyone will read this that cares, so I will call as soon as office is open to request this verbally. This was my first visit to Urgent Care and this experience was so horrible I will not use your services again. Whomever submitted incorrect information to Walgreen's needs to be reprimanded. I also would appreciate an apology as well. The man who called me at 5:30 had the opportunity, but instead was making excuses after I inquired "how did this happen". I will also be submitting a complaint to your corporate office. Someone needs to be held accountable. This is ridiculous. Now I have a headache.<//text>

I was able to book an appointment quickly and easily. Once I arrived, I probably had to wait a bit because there were a few cars in front of me. The staff was kind and polite and made the whole process really easy and painless.<//Review>

If you are flying to Hawaii and need the required covid test go here. Its fast and they are super efficient.  We were done in less than 30 min. Plus we made a same day appointment.  This was after waiting 2 1/2 hours in line at another "Hawaii partner", within appointment.  Only to find,  when it was our turn, out the test would take 5 days! Save yourself a lot of time and stress and use City Health, pay the fee and get results fast . We got results in 6 hours!!< /Review>

<text>I Love City Health Urgent Care of San Leandro. They are always so nice, quick, thorough, and professional. Anytime I come in I am in and out in record time. They are very good about following all covid protocol and are quick to answer any questions I may have. I recommend CHUCSL to anyone in need of quick top of the line medical care.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>FIVE STARS for Covid testing by City Health urgent care at Oakland airport! Be sure to make an appointment… Very Efficient drive through facility and great staff! I was nervous our test results would not arrive back in time/72 hours prior to our Hawaii flights. They exceeded our expectations and our results came back in under 48 hours. There is also an option for an expedited test in under 12 hours for a small fee.  Results come back in PDF form -very efficient all around! Five stars!< /Review>< Pics>

I don’t know if this is normal, but I waited an hour and a half to get tested! I had an 11am appointment and didn’t get my test until after 12:30pm

Every step was arduously, excruciatingly, slow. Even though I had an appointment, just the act of checking me in (the first time) took 15 minutes. Then checking me in the second time (at “step 2”) took another five minutes or so. And it wasn’t just me! You can see them standing outside other cars on their tablets for an absurd amount of time.

It literally took me 45 minutes of waiting in line to get into the facility, and another 45 minutes once I was in.</review>

2nd experience with CityHealth and I swear I get better diagnoses and service here than I did at Kaiser or any previous provider I’ve had. It’s a shame they only specialize in urgent care since I’ve been bouncing around for a PCP. Great Job ladies and gents, you’re on top of my list of UC providers.</text>

Very efficient and super friendly. The Covid PCR test was easy and painless and I had the results roughly 24 hours later. Very highly recommended!< /Text>

The test results also came back the same day which was great. 4 stars instead of 5 because when my original appointment was canceled due to high winds, Cityhealth did not send me any notification letting me know it was canceled. I had to waste my time driving to the site only to find out about cancelation after I got there. This was particularly frustrating because they sent me a text reminder that morning confirming the appointment.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808f8143c3fddd05:0x856c0d9511588fb0< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
So, when I first booked our covid tests for pre travel to Hawaii, it said the test was a 15 min rapid test. I checked a day before our flight to California/getting tested and it is no longer that way. Instead for a fee, you can get results “within 24 hours”. Naturally, I was freaking out. But, City Health Urgent Care truly delivered! We got tested at 1:30 pm and had results back by 8:00 pm. Their customer services reps using the Facebook messenger were also great! Something important to know is that the lab picks up the samples at 2:30 pm. So, if you’re in the same boat as we were try to go before that time if you’re appointment is after that cut off. Overall, great experience!< /Review>

Convenient location, great online system, lots of availability and friendly staff. Haven’t received my Covid test results yet but it’s still under the 48hr turn around so I can’t review that piece but I’m hopeful I will receive them in time.</review>

<text>I called urgent care and told me I can come in for a rapid covid test. I was exposed at work, working for Cal Fire. Little did they not tell me that I had to be a worker for Oakland just to get tested, something about a contract. Long story short I had to wait in line for almost 2 hours, just for them to say no.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< time>

Thank you Shirlie G. and the entire staff over at CityHealth Oakland Airport. I was one of the many Hawaii travelers that was having mini daily panic attacks about Hawaii's strict quarantine policies regarding results. I was about to cancel my trip but noticed on the CityHealth facebook page, Shirlie was guiding many people through comments and messaging. I messaged her and she informed me they are sending full PCR results rapidly to the lab for a $120 fee. I spoke with a few people who did this and all got their results super fast. The testing experience this morning was super smooth. Really want to extend gratitude to all of the staff- from the security guard guiding cars, to the many helpers in line simply taking IDs and getting us all checked in quickly. The entire process was painless and quick. Make sure you tell the provider who is doing your swab that you want the PCR test for the 24 hr result and pay the $120 fee, yes they accept card. I was waiting for my results like a psychopath, refreshing my email every hour. I got tested at 11am this morning.. I got my results in by 8:30pm ! Amazing. Thank you Shirlie, and ALL of the hard-working CityHealth employees for dedicating your time to get people tested. I truly appreciate your professionalism and great service !! Highly recommend CityHealth and don't worry travelers, if you have your appointment set 72 hrs in advance, pay the $120 fee you WILL have your results in time ! I would just recommend booking a morning appointment if possible.</Text>

It was very cold outside it took over 30 minutes to be tested.  Once tested the worker said that the results would come back in 30 minutes. After waiting 45 minutes I ask would they check foe status of results. They said the meter was on 3 minutes. I asked could they give me my results via email and she said yes.  I wish I was told that option in the beginning.</Text>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!! THEY ARE IRRESPONSIBLE AND RECKLESS!!! My whole family was suppose to fly to Maui today, November 17, 2020, so we did our Covid test on Sunday, November 15, 2020 so our result would come in within 72 hrs before our flight, which is Hawaii's travel regulation to have Covid test result from within 72 hours before flight. I called the Lab, which is Curative, but they have not even received our specimen yet today which is already the day of our flight. I tried to call City Health Urgent Care, but no one is answering in any of their phones listed on any branch around the area. So we have to cancel our flights, our hotel and our vacation is all ruined because rebooking last minute is very expensive already. Who knows how many persons or families they have ruined their vacations, plans and travels because they are irresponsible and reckless. They just wasted our money, time and insurance. I think they are just a scam that is just after the insurance money and will try to scam more money out of your pocket.< /Text>

<Review>New to area so this was a great place to go for treatment. Online appointments make your life easy. Simple check in process, very clean and nicely appointed facility. Kudos to Matthew who did my initial assessments. Very thorough exam and discussion with Sean regarding treatment and next steps. It’s a one stop shop with doctors and all lab work in one place. Very convenient with parking in the building on Clay St with validated parking coming soon. Highly recommend.</Review>< resp>

Checking in was done online so it just made the whole process more seamless and reduced the time taken. The people at reception were nice and very helpful. The doctor I met was super nice and knowledgeable. Probably going to be a regular there.< /Review>

<review>Update December 7, 2020:
——————————————-

Shirlie went above and beyond to help us get our Covid rest results 3 days after we arrived in Honolulu. Warrior DX lab did not deliver on their promise and CityHealth Urgent Carr did their best to address the problem. CityHealth Urgent Care reimbursed me for the lost costs of my travel with a check that they mailed to my address! I truly appreciate this level of follow up and customer care! I don’t update my review to 5 star because CityHealth Urgent care decided to work with an incompetent lab! However, it seems like they are not working with them anymore and they secured partnership with other labs. Hopefully, things will be better in the future!

Original Review:
—————————

DO NOT USE THIS PLACE FOR PRE-TRAVEL COVID TEST FOR HAWAII!! We are stuck at a hotel instead of our Airbnb and anxiously waiting for the results while losing a lot of money on both Airbnb and hotel. We are paying for a hotel where we must quarantine and the airbnb which we cannot use while waiting for the results! Our test was done on November 3 and we still have not received the results which were guaranteed to be sent within 72 hours! This issue caused serious financial and emotional problems for us. There is no one answering phone calls, emails or texts. We tried many many times to contact them and no one answers!

Save yourself from a nightmare and go somewhere else for your covid test!<//review>< pictures>

I had an excellent experience at this facility for my covid testing. The staff was professional and answered all of my questions. I went on the first day they were open and even with a skeleton crew- my experience was awesome! Huge thanks to our front line workers!!<//Review>

<Text>Arrived for a pre-travel COVID test within the specified hours. Was politely asked to go to a San Francisco branch instead, 11 miles and 30 minutes drive away. Why? I’m still not sure, as internet details for this site state ‘no referral required’ and ‘testing for all patients’. I’m an MD, and I’m pretty sure that I meet these criteria. Important to have up to date information on the internet to prevent wasting people’s time :). Thanks for your help.</Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< GmapID>

Worst medical facility I’ve ever been to, they took my money, let me sit for an hour although they didn’t even have a doctor who could prescribe a medication - don’t go there!!  It’s a sham operation!!  Shouldn’t they have a doctor if they are going to make appointments for medical care???< /text>

I had a very positive experience with CityHealth Urgent Care.  Everyone there is very pleasant and professional and the facility is spotlessly clean. I was able to have my second appointment online which is convenient and mitigated the cost somewhat. If I needed to go to an Urgent Care facility in the future this would be my first choice.< /review>

<text>First time in this brand new facility. Great overall experience! Made an apt online, which is always great. Arrived to an empty waiting room on a Friday around noon, was handed a touch screen for my info and taken to the back within 10 minutes. Intake guy was chill and thorough, and PA I saw (Sean) was prompt, professional and caring. Pretty much the whole process is paper-free, and the Walgreens just a block away makes picking up prescriptions super easy. Will definitely visit again (but hopefully not too soon!)</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

From the minute I walked in, everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The X-ray tech, the Doctor, the nurse/EMT that checked me in. No one actually wants to go to urgent care but when you absolutely have to it’s nice to know that you’re in good hands and that you’re really being heard and not just given medication and kicked to the curb.< /text>

Although the address is on Clay Street, the actual entrance is on 14th.  It is downtown ( across from both City Hall and federal buildings), but I easily found parking. Probably a better idea to take Bart or public transit. The staff were pleasant and helpful, but for some reason their credit card reader was sending out the wrong IRS code, so I couldn't use my medical flex spending account for my copay charge. Fortunately, it did take my debit card.
I was there to meet with the Doctor as she was referred by my current physician who is retiring. Dr Salmon was very personable & professional. Took my vitals, listened to my concerns & offered relevant and helpful suggestions. I would really like to continue to see her, although the location of the clinic is really inconvenient for me.  If you live nearby,
have access to public transit ,or don't
mind dealing with downtown Oakland traffic, I do recommend this clinic</Text>< Pictures>

CityHealth Urgent care was great! All of the staff were super friendly and welcoming and answered all my questions! Dr. Sean was extremely attentive and listened to my concerns. Plus I did not have insurance and the price was reasonable for paying out of pocket! I highly recommend!<//Text>

This place is completely sketchy. I scheduled an appt here for covid testing with a person over the phone, received a text reminder, arrived and had to wait 15 minutes before I was told they were closed that day. A whole family arrived and had the same thing happen to them. And apparently this has been happening for months! Seems incompetently run, for-profit healthcare. It's not the staff's fault this is why companies shouldn't be in charge of managing our health.

It's either gross mismanagement or somethings going on like they get state funding based on how many appts they schedule and they're abusing it. Places like this shouldn't exist much less be trusted with personal information.<//Text>

Came in for a visit and got seen relatively quickly. Service was good but I specifically asked to send the billing to my insurance so I can pay with my HSA card but they instead charged me $125 (with the receipt saying services.. an itemized receipt would be nice) on the card I paid my $20 Co pay with. I was planning to pay with my HSA like I told them but now I can't because I won't have it in the new year. If you go here, pay your co-pay with cash and don't let them hold your card on file.< /text>

<text>From beginning to end, I was a bit unsatisfied with my care. The Asian receptionist was giving me a hard time because I didn’t have a tangible copy of my insurance card. The PA didn’t realize that the medication prescribed was conflicting with current medications until I mentioned it. I could’ve had a serious reaction to the medication prescribed if I didn’t say anything. Lastly, I was waiting on my Uber and the receptionist kept trying to kick me out although it was 15 minutes remaining until closing time. She passively aggressively asked me to leave several times although it wasn’t closing time. I felt so uncomfortable that I left despite it being cold outside. I’m never returning and wouldn’t  recommend anyone that cares about their medical care to return.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Sean the physician assistant is not only clinically very keen, but his bed side manner and sympathetic ear makes going to urgent care an easier experience.  He takes his time and listens to you, actually listens.  For me, you can not put enough stars on here for that quality.  I recommend this urgent care and Sean when you are sick or injured and need to get in to a medical provider.  The staff there are also nice and very polite, which again is a rare thing in this day and age, I wish I could use this as my primary care.< /text><rating>5</rating><time>1565833853862</time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

Saturday comes around and I call CityHealth in Oakland to see if they take Cigna (yes!). I’m in and out with diagnosis within an hour. Sean had a mask on per my condition but I could tell he was smiling, genuinely caring and I appreciated his straightforward approach. I don’t have a primary care doc and Sean mentioned that I can get onboard. I also loved the artwork, bordered on spa-like atmosphere.

Whenever I call the Oakland office it doesn't matter what time no one ever answers. There's not even an option to talk to someone in the Oakland office. how am I supposed to set an appointment if no one's going to answer the damn phone?< /text>

< Review>
I had no appointment and they got me in in about the amount of time it took to fill out the registration forms.  Examination/xrays/evaluation happened back to back for what turned out to be a sprained/bruised foot and ankle.  They gave me a boot and I was out in an hour and a half total.</Review>

Had our covid tests done at Sac airport. Orderly and efficient service. Staff very friendly, especially the testers. Results done in 18 hours. No stress, felt comfortable, pleasant experience from setting appointment to messaging support to actual test process.</Review>

<review>Heidi was awesome. My results were moving a little slow and every time I called she was very kind and very helpful. She even made sure that everYthing was taken care of at the end of the day. It’s nice to know that there are still people like her out there.Thank you!

They were fast, quick and efficient! I made separate appts for my family but they were able to do it all at one time! Did our test right before noon and got the results back around 10pm! I was able to upload out results and didn’t have to worry about when the test results were coming!< /review>

Easy to get timely appts, friendly staff, there was a short wait in line (our appt was on a Monday around noon’ish) but once they verified ur appt/name/ID, it moved pretty fast.
Thank you for ur service, CityHealth!</review>< pictures>
