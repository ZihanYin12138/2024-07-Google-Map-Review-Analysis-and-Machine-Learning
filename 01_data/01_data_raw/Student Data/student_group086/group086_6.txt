Our server waiter guy was nice but the older asian lady was not friendly at all and did not seem patient with us or her own employee from what we observed. Learn to be a little more patient with your employee and customers.<//text>

Came in once before with my boyfriend and we liked it so we decided to come back. Second time around was not good. The food was okay i guess, not absolutely horrible but when it came time to pay it was way over charged. But i didnt care i paid anyway. Was it worth the price ?Absolutely not but im not one to go and cause a scene. Then a couple hours later I noticed they tipped themselves on my card. 20%. Which i did not authorize. So disappointing and will not be going back. Maybe if the sevice was good I wouldn't care but it wasn't. My boyfriend and i love the little old lady working here though. Super cute and super friendly :)< /Review>

<text>If I could give 0 stars I would. We arrived at 8:00pm on a Friday night, restaurant was pretty empty. We informed the waiter the rest of our party was on their way and we’d be a total of 11, he proceeded to seat us and offered us water. About 5 minutes later a waitress comes out and asks us if our party had arrived when it was obvious they hadn’t, we told her they were 15 minutes away. She then came back 5 minutes later and told us it’s a maximum of 2 hours we told her if we’d known we would have waited to be seated. She laughed and said oh no, time starts once you order the food. Our party arrived 8:20 we ordered drinks and only half of us were served we then ordered the 19.99 “all you can eat” and were told we could order 3 meats each time, she brought us 2 meats only, we reminded her of the drinks and she brought them out. We continued to order meats and at 9:25 we ordered a round and she told us last call when the two hours weren’t up yet. We waited on our order for 15 minutes and had to ask about it she then brought it.  She proceeded to take the sauces when we were still using them. She brought out our check while we were still eating and came back a couple minutes later we told her we weren’t ready to pay yet. Honestly this has been the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We’ll definitely not be going back here!</text><user_name>Karla Leon<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

Bellko is bomb! The meat is fantastic. I've been to all the local Korean BBQ restaurants in the area and you can't compare the quality of the food. The restaurant is super cool looking too. Nice and clean. You can tell they take pride in their restaurant and really treat the place and the guests nice. I'm definitely coming back!<//Text>

<Text>This is probably the worst experience I’ve ever been.
The side dishes are just food, not tasty. And each person can only order one steamed egg or tofu stew one time, not unlimited. BTW, the portion of tofu stew is way too little......
The service is poor especially when we ask a waitress to change the BBQ rack which is covered by burns and she asked us keep using it. She said no matter what it will be dirty again anyway! WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS???
It forces us to clean the rack by ourselves with napkins. Moreover, the sauce is totally terrible........
I’ll never go there again. Not recommend at all.< /Text>< Pics>

The first time I noticed it, I thought perhaps it was just that day or someone had called off but I have been about 3 other times after that and it's always the case. It gets to the point where I feel bad asking for more meat or sides because they are running around busy with other tables. This last time I was there, it took about 10 mins to get seated when there was no one in front of us and there were plenty of tables available. The servers are also the hostess so they simply could not find time to seat us.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1565709194225, 'text': 'hi Annette, thank you for your honest review.

<text>The food here is delicious. Their meats are tender. Very friendly staff. My boyfriend and I were welcomed as soon as we entered the door. We did not have to wait to be seated. Chris, our server was very attentive. He came by several times to ensure that we didn’t need anything. He even recommended a few things like the pineapple soju, which had just the right amount of alcohol content. It was our first time trying “tripe” so Chris recommended we try adding sesame oil and salt to it and we loved it. They have a nice setup inside and out. The bathrooms were clean. I had a great experience here. I will be returning soon.< /text>< user_id>

Great place! Our waitress and the other staff were very friendly and did their best to give us the best service, despite being super busy! Had a really great selection and variety. Decently priced drinks, and awesome sides including steamed egg! The general decor and vibe of the place was really cool too. 5/5 would recomment this place to others (actually thinking back on it, ran into some guys on our way out asking if this place was worth it. And I told them definitely but to come back with more time, considering that they were there half an hour before they close).<//Text>

Awesome service from Angie :) this is our second time going here and we love it. It's a great kbbq spot, food and service is spot on. We drove over half an our to come here rather than go to a more local kbbq restaurant because we know we love this atmosphere. Thanks for being awesome 👌🏽👌🏽<//Review>

<Review>Friendly service, but the food takes a long time. They charge extra for taking more than two hours, leaving extra meat, and for more stuff. We ordered the all you can eat but all of the food took a really long time to cook. The name says "And Tofu" but the only tofu choice they have is the soup, and it only has like six little pieces of tofu. If you are really hungry, I say don't come to this place.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dd32b03c2cb1ed:0xf5ba3fb79c3160c9<//gmapID>< response>

I like this place.  It's a nice quiet atmosphere so you can actually enjoy your meal.  If you need something you just gesture one of the waiters/waitress and they come right over.   I like the fact that it's close to home and there is no loud annoying music.  We asked for more sides and no problem they were brought right over.  Going there again ....< /review>

I really enjoyed this place, very clean and has a nice presentation. Staff was on point and quick to fulfill our requests. The only issue I had was that the pork belly had cartilage in it  and it was a little tough to eat, everything else was great.<//review>

< review>
This is a hidden gem! I've tried pretty much every Korean BBQ place in So Cal and this place is hands down the best! The quality of the meat is incredible for the price. Not only is it one of the best tasting meats, but everything that I tried was flavorful nothing drybor flavorless like many places out there, YES even the one in Fullerton!!!! If you are in the area don't think about it twice , the service is awesome too. Can't wait to go back.

I now have been here several times after my initial review and each time was better than the time before. I can confirm that this is by far the best Korean BBQ without a doubt the qualyti price ratio is incredible.

My highest recommendation without hesitation.<//review>

< Review>
The food kept coming, and it is good quality for the neighborhood. Just wish the atmosphere was more lively. That's about my only complaint.<//Review>

Extremely nice staff, if you like red bean paste with your KBBQ just let your waiter know; they can bring you some from the kitchen.<//Review>

Really clean place, fast service, great atmosphere, great staff, excellent pricing and awesome cuts of meat with tasty sides. Great for groups or small parties or even solo. Extremely enjoyed my experience and plan to repeat biz. Parking is meh meh but totally worth a short walk.</Text>

And u want to add a soup or salad well they charge for that too. I have never been to a Korean BBQ place that has done that. this one used to b my favorite now I'm never coming bak here again the only good part was the waitress was so nice n there was a lady wit a bowl cut that was I guess in charge n she kept on looking at us like if we were stealing</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd32b03c2cb1ed:0xf5ba3fb79c3160c9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food was ok, not great. We took my wife on Mothers day so it was really busy, and according to our waitress, they only had 2 staff members to cover the entire restaurant.  Which ended up in not so great service. The meats took forever to come out, and some never did. We ordered a California roll which never made it to the table. Instead they gave us a spicy tuna roll as they had no more California rolls left. The overall service was pretty horrible although I felt bad for our waitress as she was doing her best. I don't think I will go back here unless there are some major changes.</text>

<Review>The kbbq was okay but the service was pretty bad. They kept forgetting things and seemed really understaffed the time I went. The food was good. They gave me room temperature water, which sucked. The miso pork shoulder was pretty good but the  brisket was a little bland. Wouldn't be my first choice but it might have just been a bad night for them. This place is just the closest to my house and I keep it as an option when I don't feel like driving far</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I usually have a great experience here, but tonight was different. The server was nice, but she kept coming up to the table and saying "so no more meat right?". The first 2 times I politely said,  "I'll let you know when we are ready". And she left with a little chuckle. When she came back a 3rd time with the same question,  I felt rushed and the smirk on her face made us feel like we were eating too much at an "all you can eat" kbbq grill. We just wanted a few minutes to let the food settle to decide if we wanted more,  but being pestered 3 times was highly annoying. I will change my rating, of course,  if my next visit proves otherwise.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I went here with my mom. She is usually very picky about what she eats, so i was a little nervous if she would like it or not. Cindy, the lady who served us, was super nice and understanding. She spoiled my mom, letting her try several different things. My mom loved it so much, she made me promise to take her back. The food was amazing. The service was top notch, and we will definately be going back for more.<//review>

Saturday night.  Not very busy.  At least 12 empty tables.  Service was HORRENDOUS.  When you charge full fare for an 8 year old to eat, your service should be full fare also.  I can get past the fact that the server was, apparently, a trainee.  But, when 3 different people pass my table and can't see that there are 3 empty water glasses, I'm wondering what the problem is.  And when the woman, that passed my table 3 times while the glasses were empty, and only stopped to turn down the fire (which only made for longer cook times), kept glaring at us, it only served to exacerbate the situation. The only time anyone showed a real urgency in getting to our table was when my son got fed up with waiting for water and went and got 2 pitchers and brought them to the table.  Suddenly we had 3 people eager to see about us.

And so all is clear, just 1 week earlier, we went to another restaurant 35 miles away, and spent $80 for 4 people.  After a 2 hour wait Boiling Crab was stupendous.  Phenomenal service and great food.  For which we happily tipped 25%.

Bottom line... $68 for crap service and marginally decent food.  Last time I'll ever go there.
I guess that's what I get for trying to patronize businesses in my neighborhood.  Next time I'll just go to the place I like in Cerritos.  Less expensive.  Better service.  And a FAR better experience.

And I've already told at least 5 people about the crappy experience.  I will be telling more people.  And if you are Belllko, you know exactly which 3 people were at your restaurant on Saturday night, 2/21/15.  And you know why there was no tip left.  Keep your preformed notions to yourself.  YOU are the reason there was no tip.

I FORGOT TO MENTION...
The shears for cutting the meat were FILTHY!!!!!
And when I asked for another pair, from the glaring broad, she came back with another pair that was even nastier.  I guess dish water is in as short supply as drinking water.< /review>

Outstanding pedicure treatments. Site follows sanitation practices, and staff members are well-trained. Very enjoyable experience with expert trimming of toe nails followed with soothing foot and leg massage. My husband and I highly recommend this business.< /Text>

These ladies know what they're doing! I'm not used to getting my nails done, and they were very gentle and had lots of options to choose from if something didn't work out.

(Pardon the blue hands.

What is the point of making an appointment if service is not even provided in an appropriate window. There was no communication on to what was going on either.

The gals at Be Polished are kind and courteous. They use good gel products, as some of the best and most long lasting pedicures I have had have been done there. They are very thorough and really take their time. I do not feel rushed when I go in there like I do at some of the other salons.<//text>

Quick to help but not so good at actually doing my nails. I asked for gel 3 times and they still gave me regular. Very rushed. The lady that did my nails kept talking to others and was rushing off to talk to others. So terrible customer service< /Review>

It makes me sad to say that I give them a 1 star. I had been going here for a little over a year. I was very happy with their service but I'm not happy with my fingers at the moment. I went to get my nails done about 4 weeks ago. This time around, everything was rushed. After I left, I noticed my fingers started to itch and burn. I didn't think anything of it. I put ointment on my hands thinking it would go away but it only got worse.  The skin around my nails started falling off and my fingertips started to swell. I'm really hoping this all goes away. It's been 4 weeks and I'm still in  pain. Pus comes out of my fingertips. I'm just posting this in hopes that it doesn't happen to anyone else.<//Review>

$32 for a Euro Pedicure, includes callus removal, 15 minute foot and leg massage with exfoliating tangerine scented crystallized cream, then massage with a Shea butter and nails polish with color of your choice. I would have given 5 stars if Julie hadn't gone and paid more attention to the other staff speaking what I can only guess to be Vietnamese most of the time, also, she was very rough with the callous removing square thing and cut the side of my left foot where I had no calluses at all.<//text>

My wife really loves this place. Her favorite tech's name is Lyn. I can only buy gift certificates from Be Polished without getting in trouble. I must say her nails do look great. Thanks Lyn!</Review>

<Text>If your looking for an absolutely perfect dinning experience try Capannina. Fine service with a touch of love. May I suggest, Gnocchi con Gorgonzola...House made Gnocchi with Gorgonzola, asparagus and almonds...perfetto! 👌👏 Buon Appetito! 😘<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Tasty classic Italian dishes, with some original twists. I was a little disappointed that the bread was so cold, but otherwise everything we ordered was terrific. The burrata with broccoli rabe and beef short rib ravioli with red wine reduction were especially good.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Tonight's dinner and experience was truly great. I loved the wait staff and the owner came out to greet us and was such a nice man. I had a squid ink risotto that was to die for. My friend had the octopus and she loved it. We sat outside on a beautiful evening under the heat lamps and had an enjoyable time interacting with people walking by and the diners coming out. It gave us a warm, neighborhood feeling 😀</review>

Such authentic setting, food and service.  You feel like you've walked into a wonderfully special, intimate restaurant in Rome or Florence, with unpainted wood trim around windows and doors and warm wall decor.  All the servings are what I can only call succulent: moist, luscious, fresh.  And all of the servers and back up staff make you feel like you're the most important person in the room.  I LOVE this place...so lucky to have it here in SF.</review>

< Review>
Had 4 items, all superb.  The memories from our last trip to SF have consolidated to very few, this restaurant being one of them.  Make a reservation early and enjoy the experience of a unique, Italian American, family run, small, scratch restaurant serving properly fresh and fundamentally prepared food.  Don't let the awkward bathroom or curt staff throw you off, it is a great time.</Review>

I never thought I would actually write a review for my wonderful dining experience eating Octopus..lol..But what a wonderful meal! My dish arrived at my table hot and fresh and full of flavor. TO be honest I did not know what to expect as this was my first foray into this type of dish..but so glad I took the plunge.

The waitstaff were on point and knew their menu items back to front. They were friendly and efficient. We will be back soon!</text>

Between 5 pm and 6 pm is prixe fix time. Great bargain just because you can pick any dessert.  Big bowl of soup or salad (caesar salad with a pinch of crab meat). Entree choices: salmon, pork chop, pasta. Salmon looked great and taste great.  Just simple.  My pasta had good fresh mushroom and thick tomato sauce.  Pappardelle.   My panna cotta was smooth with mango sauce.  Intense chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato for those chocolate lovers.</Text>

<Review>Delicious gumbo! We ordered the grits and shrimp, the fried chicken, gumbo, and a couple of bloody which all were good but the stand out for us was the gumbo. We were expecting a long wait because of other reviewer comments, yet it only took 15 min...score. The restaurant is very tight, but that was fine with us we actually got to know our table neighbors. The service was great and fast. Prices are reasonable, too.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

What a great restaurant. Great food, friendly staff and attentive management. Capannina has a vast array of wines and Italian food. Dined here last night and I was not disappointed. Cioppino was divine and well worth the price, and it's not even expensive for the serving you get. Strongly recommended!!!<//Review>

<Text>Let me start from the end. I saw the manager throughout dinner speak to multiple tables, never came to our table. We were in back corner tucked away, which was ok. At end of our dinner I caught him gesturing toward our table then he came with the check. Didn't ask if we needed anything else. I asked in a somewhat joking manner, "where you been all night, you never came by our table to ask how we are doing". He didnt really have a reply. Came back with a pitcher of water, NO THANKS! So you rush us to get out after we spend over $150 for just the two of us. Wine, appetizer, dinner and dessert. The food was good and service prior to the manager was nice.</Text></record>

<Text>Terrific little neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The owners typically behind the bar and the food it authentic and delicious with a nice selection of Italian wines.  Its a small restaurant so seating is limited although I have eaten at the bar several times without problem.  Very friendly staff.  Perfect for a date night.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Solid food and wine.. pasta with white wine and clams is a benchmark dish and it did not disappoint.  Crowded and the staff was misleading about the wait, but eventually it occurred to them that they could set up another table on the wide sidewalk and seat us and so that worked.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>This place is amazing.  I live about 3 blocks away and my girlfriend want to try every restaurant on Union street but 80% of the time we go here because it is always more than excellent, it's fantastic!  Absolutely recommend it...and it has a GREAT Italian waiter that could not be duplicated...even in Italy.  You need to visit  If you are lucky enough to get there before 6, they have a terrific $30 prix fix. You need to to.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>I usually don't write reviews but this restaurant gets an exception. The Gnocchi is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it. As a picky eater at most Italian restaurants, I'm impressed.

Short menu of choices of fairly classic Italian dishes. Nice wine list with unusually fair prices. Overall, the food was good, above average, but not notable. I wouldn't go back, but I wouldn't avoid this place. A couple of notes, dined at 6pm and they told us they had run out of mozzarella, also, they only offer Moretti beers. Service was fine. Decor was pleasant, a small, intimate restaurant with about a dozen tables.</text>

<Review>A lovely restaurant with old style service and contemporary cuisine. It's cozy with an outdoor section. They really care about the service and are happy to explain every fantastic dish. Even a basic like the Tuscan chicken is wonderfully juicy and flavorful.</Review>< Pictures>

Very disappointing from start to finish, the waiter was rude, didn’t listen to our order, the food was average at best, the owner/manager ignored us. And to top it all the bill arrived with 20% tip added before we had an option to choose our tip. When we pointed this out the manager disappeared and never came near us. Overall a bad experience.< /Text>

< Review>
We stopped here because it was near our hotel. They were able to seat us immediately. Food was excellent! I had the ravioli and my husband had the Ahi Tuna. We will definitely be back when we come back to town.
Cons: Small restaurant so it is very cozy and loud. The night we went one of the waiters called in so the staff was a little less attentive.
I would highly recommend!< /Review>

Sat at the bar because there were no tables available, the bartender was extremely attentive and explained the dishes to us that we couldn't pronounce or understand. I had the mixed seafood grill and it was some of the best fish I had ever had in my life, though I didn't care for the risotto it came with. We even splurged for dessert which we never do and it was amazing as well. Definitely check it out if you're in the mood for authentic Italian and wine.</text>

My friends and I got judged when we requested a table. Waiter asked if we had reservations, which we didn't, and then proceeded to look up and down at us. Like many of the other reviews (on Google/Yelp), they clearly still had room after an hour, as we went somewhere else to eat and walked past this restaurant after we were done. Not service-oriented.</Review>

We were visiting the area with our daughter and met up with an old friend of hers for a wonderful meal at Capannina. It was recommended by a relative, a regular here, who lives in the area, and I have to say it even exceeded the high expectations that she had set. From the moment we walked in we felt at home and sat in a very comfortable table in the front window. Our waiter(s) were fantastic, engaging and attentive, but not over-the-top by any stretch...just perfect. The food was superb and one of the best meals, from start to finish, that I can remember. I had the Seared Black Pepper Crusted Rare Ahi Tuna over Spicy Prawn Risotto, and while I’m sure that all of the food is excellent (as others at my table would attest), if you go here, have the Ahi Tuna…it is a close-your-eyes-tune-out-the-world-savor-every-bite-and-let-your-taste-buds-use-all-sensory-resources kind of meal. I tend to eat too fast, but with this meal I made a very conscious effort to slow down and enjoy it…and I surely did. If we lived in this area, I’d want to go to Capannina every week.<//Text>

Wonderful,  wonderful Italian resturant,  it small quaint and NOT A CHAIN restaurant.  The Food is wonderful and the service is amazing.  A resturant the locals go to, away from all the madness on Fishermans wharf.
Very reasonably priced, for the food and service you get to enjoy.<//review>

Fantastic!

Had three courses here and all were great.   Crab Cesar was delish, and the real standout was the buffala mozzarella ravioli.  Amazing!  The pistachio creme caramel was good, but overshadowed by the chocolate gelato that came with.  Also their espresso was creamy and so good!

To top it off, the service was really fabulous.  Couldn’t have asked for better!< /Review>

<rate>4</rate><text>Really good food but only decent service. I came here in a group of 8 (we had reservations) and were seated promptly, but we were still there for over 2 hours - and didn't even order dessert! It was fine because we were in a big group with a lot to talk about, but I knocked off a star for what felt like SLIGHTLY less service than I would have liked. I got the mussels for an appetizer (wish I had gotten the lobster caesar salad because that was SOOOO good) and their new red wine reduction and ravioli as the entree.

They had pretty good wine selection although I didn't drink any (had just spent the day in Napa). I will definitely be back, but am hoping for better service next time!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808580dcad0fee49:0x8264f431c4c01b72</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

One of my favorite local Italian restaurants! The service is wonderful! My hubby and I normally get our usual waiter, Gaspare. He is awesome! The food is always tasty. Their Salmon dish is amazing as well as the papadelle with ragu sauce. The soup of the day is superb and the dessert is to die for. The warm chocolate cake with gelato and pana cotta is always a winner.< /text>

A bit cramped and loud inside, but depending on what kind of night our you're having, it could be a good fit.  They have a "bar", but it's mainly a place to park while you're waiting for a table, since there's only room at it for like 2-3 people.  Food selection was great, and everything we tried tasted excellent -- not mention the prices were pretty reasonable.  Would definitely come back here again.< /review>

(Translated by Google) What a good place to eat. The attention by the owner is excellent. sensational food. We tried the soup of the pumpkin day with crab that was sensational. A very good spaghetti with clams. The meat ravioli in wine sauce was the best dish. A shrimp risotto and ax callus that was exquisite. The wines they offer are very good. It is a good option for Italian food. Curious detail, the owner asked me to leave the soup plate clean, using a bread as a "skater" attached photo as the plate was

<text>(Translated by Google) This restaurant is recommended by Marie-Joëlle Parent in her book "300 reasons suede San Francisco". So we tried it. The service is very courteous and friendly. The menu is simple but diverse and the food is exquisite. The only problem is the à la carte price. I do not think it is too expensive for the quality and quantity of what it eats but the total of the bill will still remain high. However, it is possible to eat in a 3-course table d'hôte between 5 and 6 p.m. for only $ 30. If you are in the area, it is worth the detour. 👍

Je ne crois pas que ce soit trop dispendieux pour la qualité et la quantité de ce que la y mange mais le total de la facture restera quand même élevée. Il est toutefois possible de manger en table d'hôte 3 services entre 17 et 18h pour seulement 30$. Si vous êtes dans le coin, ça vaut le détour. 👍< /text><user_name>Martin Lamoureux<//user_name><Date>1503501227184</Date>< user_id>

Call before you just show up, then they can tell you what you need paper work wise. Lots of people get turned away, only to come back with the proper paper work.< /text>

Don't go during lunch hour. They all apparently take lunch at the same time, which isn't posted anywhere, so you get to find it out after waiting for an hour or two in the sun.< /review>

I usually don’t share an experience with DMV but today I had a great experience with an employee at the Commercial Testing Center in Fresno. The gal that helped me was a complete pleasure to work with. I wish all DMV employees were as helpful and kind as she was! Thank you!<//Review>

I was here waiting for almost an hour I went outside to grab something from my car and took 5min.... it then was 4:03pm and the guy in blue didn’t let me back in and kicked me out... my number was LITERALLY next... he refused to provide his name... very unprofessional guy, and very unpleasant visit at this dmv... the government needs better staff here!

Great service. Nice and intelligent staff. Wait time is the only issue. On average without an appointment, I wait a 3 hours. I've been here 4 today.</Review>

The only good thing this place has going for it is that it's a nice office and the location near 2 trucking schools but the wait time is a JOKE every time I've been here I've had to wait for well over an hour(2 hours wait time on regular) and for anything even if you just come to take a test your going to have to wait, I don't know if it's because there understaffed or if the current staff just doest care. If you can avoid going here do so it's a waste of time for anyone coming here< /Review>

With all the money that we have to pay in dmv fees why do people have to wait hours for a very simple transaction like a print out.  They have 2 windows open and a room full of people. Seems like dmv could figure out a way to speed things up...instead of slowing it down.< /text>

<review>Wait times are incredible be ready to wait up to 4hrs before being called. If you are here for pre trip, skills, and on the road testing you  have already failed if you get Chris. That S.O.B. has a bad vibe saw one time he failed 5 people back to back mean while everyone else is passing with the other testers. I got a white lady and she was awsome and from what I herd the rest are awsome too. Just pray you dont get Chris that guy fails people its not you its him he needs to be reviewed on how he tests people.< /review>< Pictures>

Hole in the wall kind of place very easy to miss but once you try the tortas you'll keep coming back. I'll definitely recommend the torta Cubana or the Pambazos 🔥< /Text>

Homemade flavors in a small restaurant owner managed...the service depends on who takes your order the male owner has superb customer service skills but the lady has a terrible attitude but excellent cuisine skills... overall they should have 5 stars for food but 1 star for service.< /review>

<Text>The food was okay, very tiny and cramped. The eggs were done really nicely but the pancakes taste as if you were eating a beauty blender. The pupusas were just a big mass of flour and weirdly put together. If you want to come in a group, there will be very little space, maybe like four people only? Overall it was a meh.</Text><rate>2< /rate>< user_name>

Pretty dang good fries!! I have to say I think that a place that sells only French fries and chicken would probably only do well in America. Prices are a tad high though, but it tastes really good.</Review>

Omg! I've eaten alot of different foods but I must say this spot is one of my favorites! I ordered the tater tots with bbq and sour cream Seasoning and it was amazing! I also had the chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce it was the best! If you love potatoes like I do you must try this place!<//text>

Great people most definitely. Go here and you won’t be disappointed. If you want to get your moneys worth this is definitely the place to go. Again best service I’ve ever had<//text>

Needed to get a tattoo ASAP and Rodge was quick to deliver. I even had to change the day of the my appointment and he was very understanding. At the moment, during restrictions from COVID, its appointment only but he let me come in so I could show him what I was looking for and what I needed to cover up.
It found it to be a very family oriented business. I didn’t mind one bit as I enjoyed the company but a few of his family members sat in the room during the tattoo process. They were all eager to see the results! They had a wide variety of colors so if you’re looking for a colorful piece, check out SoCal Ink! I’d say my tat came out great!< /Text>

He was very professional and did not try to rush me through my process I appreciate that's the most. It took a couple of months for me to figure out what I wanted but well worth the wait.

<Review>I had gone to get a tattoo on Friday the 13th and yes I get it it’s a very busy day because their specials but I waited four hours just for them to take in two girls right away Who is showing a little extra skin i didnt even end up leaving with a tattoo was very upset it was very unprofessional very disappointed I have gone here a few times and this is the worst experience that will never make me want to go back again.its like they didnt want to help us if that was the case we couldve gone somewhere else instead of making us wait all night. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.<//Review>< pictures>

If your ever looking for a great tattoo on a good deal head over to socal ink shop located in Oxnard and ask for Albert aka Xmen he is a really good artist. He will work with you until you get what you want. Very experienced and polite artists. I really recommend you get tatted by him.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I had to schedule an appointment with JBad at this SoCal Ink Shop in Downtown Oxnard. I liked the way that he was very generous, friendly, patient, and calm making the experience of getting a tattoo from him. I would highly recommend going to him anytime. Prices are decent and they even use numbing spray now to not feel the stinging sensation of the needle on your skin. It was just a great experience and I would highly recommend going to him for any tattoo needs. Contact him for further info. IG is JBADTATTOOS, FB is JBADfrutos. Check out his profiles and artwork on there for more details and info.</Review>< Pictures>

I’ve been to other groomers and didn’t like what they did, it was sloppy and inconsistent. But this place is consistent, and never disappoints. I won’t be taking my little guy anywhere else!</review>< pics>

<Text>My dog hadn't been to this groomer since september due to my health and Covid. (Puppy pad trained) This was her first outing to the groomer. They sent my dog home with fleas. I won't be going back. Very rude management. She even hung up on me. That wasn't smart.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>First time at this place. My poor puppies first hair cut turned out to be a disaster! I totally understand that puppies may not cooperate but shaving him completely, that is disappointing! The cut was not even close to what I asked for. He was so scared when I picked him up. You can tell the cut was rushed without care. Uneven areas everywhere. Omgosh...I’m so disappointed, the worst $70 I spent! Overly priced for poor quality and my puppy is small FYI. All the services weren’t done because my puppy would allow it. Lol really but still over charged me. I wouldn’t have mind at all if quality was there. Won’t be going back for sure  and won’t be recommending to anyone.</text><Time>1611106230569<//Time>< resp>

I cant tell you how much in love I am with this place! After switching from a national grooming salon, I definitely feel like I received a more personal touch with my fur baby. All of the groomers and bathers are super friendly and helpful, and are very knowledgeable about any of my pet's needs.<//review>

Took my lil Benny in for his very first grooming appointment. He’s a little guy and momma was nervous for him. But without hesitation the owner took him in her arms and just loved on him. I could see just how much they cared for their fur clients. After picking him up I could just see how happy he was to be there, he didn’t want to leave. He looked so handsome with his fresh new cut. I’ll definitely be back. Thanks again 100% Fancy Grooms!</text>

<rating>3<//rating><text>I took my two little dogs here to groom because the one we usually take them to is fully booked and we had to wait 2 whole months. I couldn't wait that long so I brought them here. The person that came and got my dogs was super friendly. Overall great staff. The groomers did a great job but the only complaint I really have is one of my dog wasn't able to open one of her eyes after she was done getting groomed. If the groomers had accidentally poked her eye or got soap into them, it would've of been nice to have been told there was a small accident so that way we would know how to relieve the pain and stress she was going through. Her eye was noticeably irritated but I had no clue what had happened.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1592532813689, 'text': 'Hi Adam I appreciate the review. This is the owner and you are extremely right!! Your groomer should have communicated that with you. I do know your original groomer that checked you in left early she had a emergency. The groomer the checked you out should have been the one to tell you about the soap that accidentally got in the eye during the bath and I will be talking to them both!! I apologize that this happened because accidents do happen unfortunately, I will be putting a note on your file for future if you decide to give us another chance thank you again for letting me know!!'}</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Took my Savannah in for the first time today, all the groomers were very welcoming. Domenic was awesome he was my groomer. I couldn't be happier. He was so caring of my fur baby and she loved him, as I've never seen her warm up to any groomer. I will definitely be back! Thanks Domenic you rock!!</Text>< user>

I wish i would of took a look at the bad reviews first before taking my dog here. Its sad the way you respond to bad reviews seems like you should be an adult your job is to groom a dog not insult the owner. Looks like you're only good at ripping off people. I was told the bill would be 55 after they looked at my dog then when i get back they told me 85 because she was matted which she definitely wasnt because i brushed through her hair before we arrived.

We also always mention if the dog is matted, has fleas or ticks or if dog is aggressive the price will go up. We would never scam 1st off. Second your idea of brushing right before coming didnt help the groomer, if it was extra work for him or her. We would never not explain the total and just charge you. If you were charged 85 there was probably alot of special attention your baby needed. I apologize it didnt work out.'}< /Resp>

The blonde lady is so rude i walked in trying to see how much a haircut would cost and she had attitude saying they dont have time to have a conversation started yelling at me for coming in uninvited.. i then decided to look up some of the one star reviews from this place and talk about being professional. Take a look at the comments of the owner yelling at a customer for them calling her out on mistreating their dogs</review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I made an appointment and notified them beforehand that my dog was aggressive and has never had any grooming experience. I dropped him off, as normal, and not even a minute later I was flagged down because he was trying to bite them, went back in, muzzles him and he was on his way again, and not a second later I was called by them saying they couldn’t even do a simply trim because “ThEy DoNt HaVe TiMe”. So what’s the point of my appointment ? It’s to make time right? They want me to reschedule but with my hectic schedule? Today was my only day off and now my dog is going to look like a matted mess because they didn’t wanna take a little extra longer... even after I had made an appointment. Just a horrible experience and I am not coming back.<//Review>< pictures>

{'time': 1570296344436, 'text': 'Well unfortunately you took him to the vet right before your grooming appointment. And you told us the vet had you muzzle him to. We tried to work with him and give him treats and its just unfortunate he would NOT let us touch him. We normally recommend a introduction groom as a puppy after the second set of shots. So we may properly introduce them to the grooming so the may enjoy grooming from here on out. He is 2 years old and has never been groomed according to you. He was very scared and kept taking the muzzle so we tried and I do apologize for not being able to do a groom. But definitely good luck on your future grooms.'}</Resp>

<Text>Love this place. My dog freaks out when getting her nails trimmed, somehow they are able to calm her down and do an awesome job. They're even able to Polish her nails which is amazing.

Once a month or so, I get to drop of my dogs and just seeing all the happy pups in there is easily the highlight of my day. And when I go to pick them up, my dogs are tired from the fun they have had there, completely as ease! The business was built with love and the skill these ladies have is really quite impressive. Both my dogs and I are very spoiled and we are so very thankful for the ladies at 100% Fancy Grooms!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Amazing Brilliant my dogs love them and I am very pleased with the excellent service my Schnauzers love it they did not get a single cut. Our groomers in Vegas would always have an accident Brandy's long eye lashes got snagged in Vegas. You ladies are amazing at 100 % Fancy Groomer and I have bragged about your place and can't wait to see you next time.

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Just had my second visit, amazing! The first visit I found this place because my usual groomer was swamped, needless to say my past groomer made me feel like just another dollar, not a person. The great ladies at 100% Fancy Grooms made my Kitty look and smell great! They even gave her a nice autumn theme bow! I just took her in yesterday and I was greeted by the same great staff who fixed up my Kitty once again, even with a winter season bow! They have the best service and prices, and I&#39;ll see them again soon!< /review><rate>5</rate>< username>

< Review>
Is okay for emergency. They just don't have a post or flyer to look at different packages and prices I took my dog last year they charged me $55 I took him this year they charged me $65 same dog and same service, Jackie said that prices had went up. He had a shave rash so at the end I ended up paying $100 to the vet to get antibiotics due to him licking and getting an infection haven't gone back since then.< /Review>

We had gone to three other groomers before going to Jayde and Sonia and no other groomer compares to the service, quality, and experience we have received from them. They do exceptional work and treat our dogs as if they were their own. I am so thankful that we finally found someone that not only we love, but our dogs do as well.</review>< date>

Good luck 85 bucks to shave my dog all the way down no thanks i own clippers if i want that i'd do it my self, i guess they specialize only in small breeds.... my dog was not even matted to be shaved completely. Lazy is what i smelled + i always tip.</review>

{'time': 1512591511766, 'text': "Hello I'm sorry that I barely seen your review. I am the owner of the grooming salon and did hear my groomer speak to you in a very polite manner explaining to you that your dog was matted and she will definitely do whats most safe and comfortable for your pet. We don't like to traumatize or do anything that makes them feel uncomfortable. OUR standard poodles do start at $80 .$5 for the matting fee was actually a giveaway we normally charge more than that. ITS ALoT OF WORK. Lazy is not what we do!! our work is quality work were based on quality not quantity so I'm sorry that you feel that way. Good luck with your future grooms"}</resp>

<Date>1343798499871<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>100% Fancy Grooms is very reasonably priced, and they always give my dog special attention. They will consult with you and give advice but do what you want if you have requests or want to change the dog's grooming routine. (I'm sure we have all been to those 'assembly line' type groomers where they say they'll do what you want but then you get back this dog you hardly recognize, and after waiting all day, too.) My dog is usually out in a couple of hours, even if they squeeze her in last minute. They also go that extra mile to make cute bows just for her. Even though my Border Collie has separation anxiety and tends to be a drama queen when I drop her off, I feel very comfortable leaving her there, I know she will be comfortable and safe. And even though I don't get any special decorative services for my dog, I really enjoy seeing some of the interesting and creative things they do in the way of glitter tattoos, dye jobs, shaved patterns and nail colors for the more adventurous customers. They also sell products there if you want to spruce your dog up between visits. Thank you to Jayd and Sonia.< /Text>< pics>

The groomers here do a great job with both our dogs. Get a reservation early, they're typically very busy, especially before big holidays. About $100 bucks for two dogs, one being a very difficult Shih Tzu. Very happy with end result every time.< /Text>

I showed up on time to pick up my dogs and they we handling my dog very rough. Domonic was pulling on her legs very rough trying to get to her nails and had a muzzle on her but when i said something they took it of. He looked like he had little to no patience with ny dogs. He groomed 3 of my little ones in 1 appointment my which was at 11:30 am and was told 3 hours but i did not get my dogs until 4 pm. When i arrived at the time i was told to i was told it would be much longer. The workers tend to talk and take their time while upcharging my bill. My dogs have always been healthy and have never had worms but after their visit i noticed worms in their poop. I called to complain and they said it wasnt them it has to be fleas that caused it but they said they had no fleas when i asked to talk to someone above the manager i was speaking to she laughed and said shes the owner then hung up on me. Very unprofessional.<//text>

<resp>{'time': 1526174046526, 'text': "Ok the review I was waiting for!! You called and complained about your dogs getting worms at our place and I explained nicely how dogs get worms 1st off!! Second I have notes you bring 2 cocker mixes and a 14 year old shih tzu once a year, well let's say every 6 months!! Dogs should be getting groomed no longer than 2 months. Your dogs are not comfortable with the grooms because of you!! Of course they are scared after 2 months they forget what we teach them and we have to do it all over!! We have accommodated you plenty and obviously your not happy!! Feel free to take your business elsewhere!! Since you disrespected my employees by calling one of them ghetto a** bitc** instead of handling all of this like a adult. IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM WAS YOUR DOG HARMED AND YOU CALLED AND NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AND YOU ALSO SAID WHEN YOU WALKED IN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER ONE AGRESSIVE YOU DIDNT THINK THAT ONE WAS.

Best place to take your dogs!!!! The first time I took my dog the girls working there where so so nice, friendly, and sweet. I usually dont write reviews but they really did impressed me. They always do a great job with my dog (spaz) and because they do a great job and they are so friendly I recommended 100% fancy grooms to my brother who has two dogs and all my friends who have pets. After my brother and friends took there dog to fancy groom they told me, they all loved it and will continue taking them there. So everyone GO AND CHECK IT OUT!! :) YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO :)<//review>

Amazing that I got my two babies groomed in less than 4 hours with Jackie!!!! Having 6 dogs I know all too well how long it usually takes at different groomers, they could be there at least 6 hrs, which is waaay to long, the prices are good as well!!</Text>

<Text>We are SO glad we found this place. They have GREAT pricing, (Way better then Petsmart or Petco or any of those big name places...hell even better then the "pet spa" places around town, considering the quality of their services) And not only that, they take GREAT care of your pets. We were worried that they would have problems with him, because for some reason every other groomer we brought him to had problems with our dog being aggressive (Which we were so confused by because he's never even barred his teeth at anyone. Not even other dogs or cats. He's a big lover!) Well those other groomers must have been doing something wrong, because we've now been there twice, and they always tell us how well he behaved. If you don't mind it when your dog gets shoved in a kennel, and don't care if minimum-wage-paid teenagers who don't know how to work with animals handle your pet then go ahead and pay out the nose for PetsMart. If you want people who actually LIKE dogs and know how to handle them to groom your best friend, bring them to 100% Fancy Grooms. You'll save money, and save your dog the stress.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>One of my favorite boba places! Drinks are delicious and there are a ton of options. Plus its family-run, nice to support local businesses. Wait time can be a bit long a times, but its 100% understandable and worth it< /Review>< pics>

I've tried more than a few Boba places through out North County and this is still my favorite. They definitely use real ingredients, and the staff is super friendly. Definitely worth a visit!</Review>

<Text>Walked in and was ignored while there was bustling behind the counter. I was the only one in the place so I was patient. Another person came in behind me, and then a family. It's not like they didn't know we were there. I left and so did the single person after no one asked for orders or anything.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Such great boba!! The employees are really nice and very on top of things! I recommend the chai tea boba, it has such great flavor and you can actually taste the spices. They also don’t put too much ice which is a huge pet peeve of mine, and they put a good amount of boba so you don’t run out after just a few sips. I totally recommend the place, it’s my new go-to boba shop.< /text>

<text>Customer service is great.

Ordered a green smoothie. It was good.
Ordered a latte and it was the worst one I've ever tasted in my life. I'm pretty sure they used non dairy creamer in it. For sure not worth 4 bucks. Do not come here for coffee.

Bathroom is broken. No wifi. Not really a great place to chill or work or study. Very limited seating too.<//text>< Response>

Hands down the best place to get delicious BOBA drinks tea, smoothies, milk tea, if it’s BOBA related they got it. I’ve never had a bad experience with this place the drinks are so delicious they are always worth the drive to get. I try a new drink every time I’m here. Today Oreo cookies BOBA it is amazing.<//review>

The owners are super friendly and you feel like you are supporting them more than just a bussiness.
Customer service is Great.
Their variety of choices in terms of addons and drink choices are wide and AFFORDABLE. They also offer fair snacks if you ever need a small snack with your drink.
They also have their kids in the corner doing things and it's cute to see them and gives it a more family casual feel compared to other cafes.< /Review>

Didn't take a photo this time guys but the Boba Teas, smoothies, and coffees are amazing.
I used to come here a year and a half ago before I moved and now that I'm back I can't not go in at least once or twice a week!</Text>

<review>This place is fantastic, delicious, and reasonably priced. Their boba is delightful and they have multiple flavors. Their drinks range from smoothies to yogurt drinks. I love this place, and my family and I have all been raiding it recently. I would've gone tonight, but we were 20 minutes too late in our craving.<//review>< response>

I love this place! I try to visit at least once a month. The drinks are really good, my favorite is the Thai Tea Boba and the Milk Tea Boba. The workers are very kind and quick. I have noticed a decrease in quality in terms of the drinks (recently), but maybe it just wasn't a good day. Completely recommend for casual boba.< /Text>

<text>It is an amazing little place with great drinks.  It offer great selections, and there are a lot of them are made from fresh fruit.  I specially love its Mango Milky Frost, Fruit Yogurt.  It even has the Green Smoothies that made with fresh fruit & veggie.
It has boba and all kinds jelly to add on drinks, and that is another reason we love to go.</text><date>1399480041823< /date><Gmap_id>0x80dc70ef2ae95d41:0x295c89d9f8425e51<//Gmap_id><userid>111647550085872665934</userid><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>She said coffee was going to be hot... It was easily drinkable right away.
I asked for a cup of water to drink while I wait... She said no buy a $4 bottle of water. Tried this place cause I hate Starbucks... Limited amount of coffee shops on hwy 76. Too bad</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was looking for a great cup of coffee and decided to try them out. Although starbucks wasn't to far away, I thought I would give this establishment a try. I ordered an iced Americano and paid about $4 for the medium drink. It tasted like instant coffee and even looked to watered down. I don't think this is the place for your coffee.<//text></record>

Massage was great but man in the front kept harassing me about a tip I left. Well can I get my massage first before I leave a real tip. It's like he wants you to leave this extravagant tip before the services are performed.not how things work an I honestly think he kept the tip for himself instead of giving it to lady who does the massage kinda weird..<//Text>

I called before my appointment no one answered. I park and knock on the door at 11:55 still no answer. I called twice and finally a man answers and he has the car speaker going so he cant hear. I put my phone and speaker and he says he will have someone let me in that was at 11:56. 12:00 pm I am still outside waiting. I call back three times and the man answers again. Stating he will be there in 10 mins. My appointment was for a prenatal massage with Anna. He arrives at 12:20 pm and takes my temperature and money. He then says he will look for the reservation and asks to see mines. At this point I am overly confused as to how you can take my money and then not find my reservation. I asked for my money back and I would show him my reservation. I showed him the reservation for 12 pm and left very unhappy. Not to mention that I did my due diligence in calling before I went in.</text>

<review>Got a great deal on the massage. the best masseur I've had in along time and u have had massages all across the world. It's like Thailand came to west Hollywood. She is an expert and her strokes are bold and her technique professional. She knows what she is doing. The staff is friendly and the combination massage is the one to go for. It is A hot stone with aroma therapy.< /review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I booked a prenatal massage for noon with Chloe. I arrived at 11:45 to locked doors (assuming it was due to covid that the doors were locked) so I called to ask them to let me in. A man answers the phone, tells me he has no appointment at noon and insinuates that I made a mistake. He asked me about an email confirmation, which I did receive, and then says it’s impossible because Chloe doesn’t work today. I booked online and she was an option—I don’t even know her so it’s not like I requested for her and she’s off or something. He then says to try again next time and then hangs up. I’m 38.5 weeks pregnant. Probably not going to be too much longer before I give birth. Wasn’t even apologetic for the website making a mistake and didn’t even offer to fit me in at another time slot or another day. Super unprofessional. No idea how the massage would be, but wasn’t good customer service.</Review>

❤❤❤ THIS WAS MY 1ST VISIT TO HAVEN AND IT'S DEFINITELY THE START OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP. I HAD THE MOST RELAXING, DEEP TISSUE STONE MASSAGE THAT I HAVE EVER HAD. I LOVE THE STAFF AND HOW PROFESSIONAL THEY ARE. THE DAILY SPECIAL WAS THE ICING ON MY BIRTHDAY CAKE. THE OWNER WAS VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY, HE AND HIS STAFF SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME WHICH WAS VERY SPECIAL. THIS IS A GREAT BUSINESS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A LONG TIME RELATIONSHIP HERE, THANKS FOR MAKING MY BIRTHDAY GIFT GREAT, YOU GET 👍👍👍 FOR ME.<//Text>

The massage was good, not the best I have ever had but it was good.  I didn't like the fact that when I gave my tip, the lady at the front told me they expect more, and wanted me to change the tip to what she was telling me.  I really did not like that.  Tip is not mandatory, it's what the customer can afford or would like to give.  Also my mom was waiting in the waiting room and told me that after I went in, other people came in and asked for the same massage I got, same amount of time and they got quoted a lower fee :/</Review>

<Text>They have no idea what a Swedish massage is...ask for one and they'll give you a Shiatsu instead! You have to enter the place from inside entrance...workers do not have a good mastery of the English language either so its hard to understand and be understood.

<Text>Worst massage experience ever! Non-english speaking & could hear people talking on phone through whole experience. I had to ask for a second massage therapist who wasn't much better & got haggled for a tip all the way to my car by the owner! I liked the establishment alot more when it was the Effleurage Day Spa but now I clearly would not go back nor recommend to anyone.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808f8f9666c05251:0x449121db7d5f38ba</gmap_id><Rate>1<//Rate>< pics>

We were visiting West Hollywood and looking for something yummy, somehow ended up here. First time here and food was fine. Service was okay but In all fairness to our waiter, the restaurant was busy. The hostess not so friendly but it was late so she could have had a long day. I had the bean and cheese chimichanga, it was okay. My friend had the steak Moreno and said it was okay but he felt the meat did not taste like top sirloin. My other friend had the Chile relleno combo which he enjoyed.  They offer the typical chips and salsa but if you like hot salsa make sure you ask for the "hotter" salsa :-) they have a fairly large menu so it is worth the try<//Text>

The. Food. Was. Amazing.
Went to Ports O' Call initially. It was a 3 hour wait in long line just to even get to the door.
Left, went here and IMMEDIATELY got a seat, chips and salsa.</Text>

<Text>What an amazing experience from the server to the food! If I could box this place up and take it back to Ohio I surely would. By far the best salsa ever, I asked if someone's mother was in the kitchen with a molcjete making it. The machaca chimi hit the spot!</Text><Name>Douglas Strickland</Name><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

Came here since I hate long lines and the fish market line was super congested. Nearest Mexican restaurant with a non Mexican name other than mexican in Green Onion Mexican Restaurant. Food is one of my main critics and food was a 6-7 out of 10 honestly. Tamales, enchilada, Chile relleno, carne asada was pretty basic and bland.</Text>

<review>The food was good but the service was horrible . My husband asked for water 3 times from 2 different waiters and didnt get it until the 4th time asking our waiter was too busy flirting and attending to the ladies at the next table . I personally had to ask for a menu from another waiter that wasn't ours. Like I said food was good but they need to work on customer service we drove an hour out of town for that and the experience was not good.<//review>< gmapID>

Usually I would give this place five stars. I love it. But covid seems to have taken a toll. Had to sit in a hot parking lot. (No big deal its everyplace right now) but the table was siting at a slant felt like we had to hold everything on the table. We ordered a pitcher of Cadillac margaritas and I truly feel they left the tequila out. Then when they brought out the food, multiple tables on the tray so  they set it down and here comes the flies.< /Review>

<Text>Good place for Mexican food. The displays of the antique cars were nice to see. Food was good too. Prices were reasonable and decent sized portions. Seemed like locals were plentiful in this San Pedro location. Good safe location.</Text></record>

I would travel a far distance for this authentic mexican food. It is the bomb. And the margaritas are to die for.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>We had drinks and appetizers in the bar. I had peach margaritas, which were way too good! It was happy hour, and I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which was delicious. Our waiter was friendly and efficient. We got there early, which was good, as it got crowded with people watching sports. The restaurant is very pretty on the inside. The bar was lovely, but I was also intrigued by the room across from the bar with a few tables and a fireplace. I wonder if they use the fireplace in the winter. It would be lovely;< /Review>< Pics>

This was an unplanned dining experience.   Out original plans fell through.  We saw this place and decided to try it.  Upon entering we thought it was going to be very expensive.   Pleasant surprise,  it was not.  The wait staff were very nice and prompt.  It became apparent this is a popular place to eat.  The food was very good.  Parking lot was no huge but they do have off street parking.< /Review>

Food was quick and delicious. I had the fajitaquesadilla. Loved the grilled onions and veggies. Rice also great flavor. Only 4 stars because the restaurant itself was a little old and did not have a clean appearance. Loved the many photos on the walls but the frames and glass were dirty.< /review>

<Text>Good quality food, decent prices and large portions. Nothing life-changing, just the basic Mexican food you can find anywhere.

Mr. M got the Cobb Salad which was loaded with bacon and cheese. Mom did a lunch special -$5.95 for a tamale with rice and beans. It said you could choose any meat, but she was informed that only Chicken was available that day (a Friday). Hubby got the shrimp fajitas because it was Lent. He enjoyed it, but seemed particularly smitten with the warm tortilla chips and the freshness of the salsa.

I got the cheese Nachos. Just tortilla chips covered in melted cheese, not disgusting cheese sauce. It also came with guacamole. Again, nothing life changing, just exactly what I expected. But I certainly appreciated the extra thick layer of cheese on top (even if the chips on the bottom layer were left naked).

Service was very fast and friendly.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>One of my long time favorite mexican restaurants. When I travel back to San Pedro from my now current home on the east coast The Green Onion is a must do. It is hard to find the quality and taste I so love on the east coast. As they say, close but no cigar. This past trip is was excellent blended margaritas and a wet chile verde burrito.<//text>< pictures>

<text>First the positive about this restaurant. The price of the food is reasonable and the portions are generous. The service however was dreadful at best horrible at worst. The waiter had a bad attitude from the moment we got there. He kept the attitude the entire time we where there. We where a group of about 10 people. Most of us meet each other for the first time today. Naturally we asked for separate check. The answer was a resounding no. They would not even split the check 2 or 3 way. The waiters said he would manually split the check so everyone can pay their part. When we asked for the check it was only one check. All 10 people agreed we are not going back to this restaurant.<//text><rating>1< /rating><time>1556938428475</time>< Response>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>This is the exact type of place I've been looking for. More friendly locals seem to hang here than tourists. You can definitely tell people love the place as there are personal photos of patrons covering every wall in the place. Staff is friendly and helpful. Margaritas are perfect (they don't use those optical illusion glasses that make it look like there's more beverage when it's really just thick glass). I'll definitely be coming back often!</Text><username>Jay Bomberger< /username><user_id>101791279006650964320<//user_id>< Gmap_id>

Went here about 2 weeks ago for my grandma's birthday it was fast and incredible food! The parking isn't ideal, but the atmosphere inside is great. A true San Pedro gem. The only gripe I had, was that my cousin found a long hair in her food! The staff were nice and brought her out a new side, but while eating it, she found yet ANOTHER HAIR in that same side dish that they supposedly made another of. It sucks to think that this awesome place with amazing tasting food would happen not once, but TWICE to the same person, is really hard to say that it's just a coincidence. If they start to put their hair back or wear some hair nets, you'll see me come back many times, because the food was excellent!< /Text>

<text>The Green Onion's food is good quality, classic Mexican American with huge, moderately priced portions smothered in sauce and cheese and served very slowly. It's a huge place with a full bar in the middle and walls covered in Mexican kitsch. You know the drill and Green Onion nails it.</text>< name>

Worst Mexican food we have ever had and we love Mexican food.  The food had no flavor and salsa was tomatoes sauce. Everything looked sloppy and presentation was poor and bland. The service was good.< /Text>

The drinks are also great, not watered down.
I would definitely recommend this place if you want some good Mexican food. Staff is friendly and polite. Couldn't believe how quickly we got our food.

Big portions of bland food even the salsa no flavor. Steak fajitas had so much fat on it and soaked in grease I couldn't eat most of it. Will not go back, there are better places.< /review>

Good food. The fact that they do not split checks and also give hand written checks is ancient, outdated, and very annoying because I was left sorting it all out myself for 45 minutes calculating everything. If that changes immediately I will give 4 stars. If not, then 2 stars it is.< /Review>

Food is so good! And the margaritas are delicious,  take it from a guy who can't handle tequila! Service, though very, very friendly, our waiter would space out and forget about what we needed. Otherwise i would give 5 stars. It gets really crowded during dinner time so be ready to wait a while to be seated.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Very amazing food (especially the chimichangas). I loved their margarita as well.

My favourite part was the service. Our waiter was extremely nice and not like an ordinary waiter. Visiting from Canada, I’ve noticed a lot of nice people in the area already but this restaurant was amazing.

The lady that told us to wait for seating told us 25 minutes and she then brought us in within 5 minutes.

Will be going there again for a second visit before leaving!<//Text><user_id>114792898509626972800<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Oh F@%K, where do i start! After searching the entire area for a place to eat. We choose this place. Wrong choice people! If a health inspector would stop in there and actually do their job. They would probably shut it down so the owners can do a deep cleaning! Either way, that would be my suggestion and it really needs to happen before someone gets sick. The food, hmmmm. Yeah the food was not great at all. To me it was very washed. By saying that. I mean none of the food the four of us ordered was authentic tasting at all. My family could cook circles around the food served here. We ate ONLY because we were super hungry after going to the football game. The bartenders need a brushing up on newer drinks. I took a sip of my drink and it tasted like straight liquor. I literally asked for a larger glass so he could dilute my drink down a lot. The nail in the coffin for me was the covers above the tables. OMFG!! The green canvas covers above the tables along the walls were SOOOO dust covered that they looked brown. If someone were to bump them it would be all bad. All in your food, hair, face, just nasty! That's where I say an inspector would probably or should shut it down for a deep clean. I literally had to stop looking around because after I noticed that, I didn't want to discover something else and get even more disappointed and discussed. I should have known as soon as i walked through the door. It was dark (in a creepy dark way), cluttered (in a bad decorative way). I thought I walked into an antique shop or a run down mom and pop thrift store.  I am done. Not sorry for any of my comments!! Clean your play up owners of the Green Onion. To the people looking, i suggest keep looking in the area for a great dinning experience!!< /Review>< resp>

<Review>This place really surprised me. I picked it for its proximity to my hotel. It was not to busy but had a lively group of locals. Maybe 25 to 30 patrons all together.  I was greeted within a minute of being seated with fresh salsa and tortilla chips.  The bar tender who was also my server promptly took my drink order and was very helpful with food recommendations. My food was on the table within 3 minutes and the proportions where far more than I expected for the price. It was more than I can eat and I have been known to put away some food.  It did leave me wanting more but only because I really wanted to try some of their other menu items. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I was already stuffed. I will defiantly be back when I am in town again.<//Review>< pictures>

Green Onion has the best strong margaritas in town! When you walk in you will notice every table has a few margaritas on it... Do yourself a favor and get a pitcher or two.

Also they make a great taco platter which is good for small parties at the house.< /Text>

This is an old San Pedro standby.  Not authentic Mexican by any means but still a great place to eat.  Good food, good prices, generous prortions.  there are booths and tables and a separate bar which has a large screen TV usually tun ed to a sporting event.  Cabinets filled with model cars and other items as well as walls filled with pictures of locals create an interesting ambience.  Adequate off street parking. Good harbor views from some booths.<//Review>

Brought some relatives here from out of town. Service was good. Food was horible. Don't know what you all consider good Mexican food but this was not it. The red chili sauce was made with rancid cumin. If you want real authentic Mexican food try Compadres , they are the real deal, home made corn tortillas. I spent close to $100 dollars here at the rotten onion and feel like I have been robbed<//text>

The food was amazing and the prices are reasonable... Customer service is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone. It's great to bring the family too. Take time to look at all the mounted pictures and car models and my favorite the Gold antique cash register.< /Text>

< Review>
I love this place. It was as my first time there and it was extremely crowded for a Monday.  I know being crowded is a good sign, but it was alittle annoying that the bar had a waiting list. Once I got over that, everything else was perfect.  The tacos are delish, and the margaritas were the strongest I've ever had at a restaurant.  I'm already planning my next visit.  U will love it.</Review>

I thought the salsa was a little bland but a little salt helped. Overall, I really enjoyed the food & the atmosphere. There are several interesting porcelain dolls throughout the restaurant to view.

The food service is great and also the food. And they do have a bar that you can socialize with others. They do have television for entertainment at Sports and other events.< /review>

My favs are the chicken taquitos, chicken fajitas, arroz con pollo y chicken Vera Cruz. Green Onion is my home town favorite when I desire Mexican cuisine. The chefs are not ordinary and make allowances for my food prep requirements which comply with my dietary needs. Great restaurant, great wait staff and great food selection 😊</Review>

I eat there pretty often. The dishes are very good and the drinks are great. Prices are reasonable. There's a sports bar as well. A lot of locals eat here.< /text>

<Text>You can’t get much better for home style Mexican food. Huge portions, great prices & service.  Carnitas enchiladas were the bomb.  Only 4 stats because the salsa was so so.< /Text><name>Michelle Hillyer</name><Gmap_id>0x80dd363724bd5259:0x17c10ea79f6225b3< /Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>109288022495190706633<//user_id><time>1530390729957< /time></record>

Terrible service from Vanessa. Food was ok. I ordered carne asada but it definitely tasted and looked like a chunk of roast beef.<//review>

<review>The service was ok but the food was horrible. The rice was bland, the beans looked as if they had been sitting out all day long so I was afraid to taste them. The carne asada in the taco was bland and tough. The server claimed he didnt charge us for the soft drinks yet he increased the price of the entree stating it was extra because we ordered steak tacos. Normally they let you know when you are ordering if there's an extra charge. We will never ever return to this restaurant.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>Went there for a family function. I had the tamale plate.
My food was reheated and overcooked.
The salad had water in it and the dressing was runny. None of my food seemed fresh made. All of the food seemed canned or frozen. I saw the hot wings they were defiantly from frozen.

I wouldn't go there by choice , ever.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

We go here often. I say just skip the enchiladas. Everything else is pretty good. Not usually a wait. They have a good taco building special. I usually get something with a Chile Relleno. Service is good.<//text>

<Text>I was here with my friends total of six people.
They said we have to pay as one check.
The only reason why I gave two stars instead of one is because the food is alright but customer service sucks.
We had to wait 10 to 15 mins to order and took awhile to bring our drinks. Our second drink came out like 10min after when we finished our food.
Not a good experience.
I don't recommend at all, there are several other places near with much better food and service.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Super fun
Parking is crazy
Good food
Good service
Has a bar
Kinda looks like an antiques store with display cases of old stuff.
Plus there are tons of pictures of average looking people all over every wall in the place.
Romantic with separate little rooms verses one big room . Most likly this place was set up for smokeing and never was able to remodel .<//text>< username>

I can't say enough how much my husband and I love this place. We go in once a week atleast. My husband always gets the arroz con pollo, which is delicious. The chicken has a flavorful mole sauce. The chips and salsa are great, always fresh. Ask for the green salsa. It is delicious. I love their tortas, my fave is the carnitas torta! And you can't forget about the margaritas! Delicious! I get the strawberry margarita and my husband gets the cadillac margarita....<//review>

<Text>This pub and restaurant has the live drawing of  "Hotspot" lottery drawing every four minutes. It is a Happy place to go and the employees are conductive to the great atmosphere. I won 5/5 on the hotspot there a while back and was paid johnny on the spot $450.00. They also have a sample plate with lots of everything for around $15.00 and it easily feeds 3 or 4  hungries and their margarettas are awesome.<//Text><resp>None</resp><user_id>110230858165919668582<//user_id>< pictures>

Excelent! I go here about every two weeks (and for good reason). The place has a very authentic feel, and so does the food. Prices are very good for the servings, and the service is excellent. My favorite Mexican Resteraunt in Pedro.< /review>

A group of 9 went to the Green Onion on Saturday night. The service was slow and the waiter was rude. Some of our food was served cold in the center and our drinks were served without ice! because "we ran out". Who does that? I will never recommend or eat at this place again.< /text>
