In my most humble opinion about this establishment,this is honestly the most respectful,most helpful, courteous and fresh Japanese cuisines made right to order and in a timely fashion. I've been coming to this small yet peaceful neat and very clean eatery for some years now.It's in my neck of the woods and the two very sweet ladies that run this establishment are very gracious,honest & hard-working as so  their staff. Give it a try I highly recommend. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐😊❤️👍👌🙏<//Text>

Really 3.5... perfectly serviceable Japanese food in downtown. if you want deeply open tick, truly legit Japanese food and I would encourage you to go to Little Tokyo which is very close by. The food flavorful but a bit single dimensional, but perfect if you want decent quality Japanese food during a work lunch time.<//Review>

Two words: call ahead. This place is worth a trip through the stink and grim of downtown core.  It’s a great value and very accommodating. It is always packed but it does have a separate cashier for people that phone ahead. The food is typical Japanese’s fast food. The salads are fresh and the meat is juicy and the tempura is crispy and not over cooked.< /Text>

As is happening to most places downtown, the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.  I used to go here regularly, but haven't been in a year or so.  Wow, has the quality and portion size gone down.  My Philadelphia roll now has tiny pieces of salmon on top and no avocado, cucumber instead and it's a dollar more!  Not coming back here again.  I'm sad because this was a really good lunch sushi place.< /review>

I ordered a bowl that had spicy lobster it was disgusting to say the least. I opened up the container that held the food it just looked sloppy. I tasted it and it tasted really fishy which means the food wasn't fresh. I won't go back again no time soon.<//Review>

I used to love coming here until I got sick December 7th, 2017. Went here for lunch then back at work could not stop going to the restroom. Diarreha and vomiting before the weekend is not what I wanted. Be careful eating here. I had the spicy tuna roll and California roll. Sorry for the graphic details but, they should be more careful with keeping any fish they use for food items fresh.

Thanks Mitaki!<//text>

This Mitaki is not affiliated with Mitaki on Hill Street in DTLA, so you will not get the same specials.

The lunch box here with tax is just under $10 and it is not worth it.  The portions are really small.  My rice portion was the equivalent of a plum; the beef was of similar portion.

When I arrived, I was very confused about the menu on their board as it only had 6 items with no price on them.  I inquired about the lunch specials to which the cashier replied by handing me a menu.

Quickly scanning the menu (even though no one was in line behind me - I still felt pressured to choose quickly) I ended up choosing the beef tempura box.

There were two other parties in the restaurant both of which had their food, so I do not understand why my food took 15 minutes to get out.  The fact was however, that the cook had dispatched my food quite quickly but it sat on the service line for a while.  I had seen it just sit there.  The cashier seemed to be preoccupied with other paperwork that she did no notice my order sitting there.

Another party came in and ordered and not until their food came out (which she served first) did she dispatch my food.

Overall, I do not have a good impression with this place.<//text>

I love my school it’s best place for making your dreams come true. I started with basic knowledge of the medical field and I ended up with becoming student of the month , president of the class and ambassador . The staff is great specially  my teacher Mr. Dominguez he is a great instructor and I highly recommend for everyone whom is looking to make there dreams come true to enroll into his class , and this school . Mrs Jackie is the best president and helps out with everything you need answering questions. The classrooms are always fully stocked, classmates are the best it really is a great environment.<//text>

<text>If i had never walked inside this building I'd still be homeless. I went to UEI with zero expectations and a low self-esteem. I felt like there was no opportunities for me. But i was VERY Wrong. UEI helped my get my life together. The staff are exceptional, they only want to see the students succeed and they really care. The only way you can fail here is by failing yourself and not coming. Attendance is key. True Pivotal Transcendent experience for me. Special Thank You to Ms. Jackie and Ms Melanie, thank you for believing in me 💓</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyd8hMGdYLcaA-SA0EF1igz5-cR8TfUX7eU2JI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYsde3nPzcwM7gxv9waXmvzykzoTc3JXX8NQ0t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Going to school here is a waste of time right after my externship I had gotten a job for 3 days and then they let me go. The school keep asking how the job is and when I told them what happened they couldn’t find anything else for me. It is not a guaranteed job right after school and it’s very hard to look for another one with no experience. To be honest if your not Hispanic don’t bother with UEI College it will be a waste of time and money.</Review>< pics>

<Review>UEI College - Encino Online is a great course and program to get you up to speed and be prevalent in today's job search for new software engineers.  As a graduate, I feel as if I'm ahead of the game and have a better chance for job opportunities and am better equipped during the job hunt.  I wish the career portion of the course was a mandatory subject in college.< /Review><Date>1608455623008< /Date>< GmapID>

Beware, if you are going into the medical assistant program, they are not accredited by ABHES or CAAHEP so you CANNOT become certified medical assistant by the AAMA. If you move states you will not be able to use your certificate and a lot of jobs require you to be certified.<//Text>

<text>Id give them 0 stars if I could.

They're forcing my sister to go to school when the person who sat next to her in school was diagnosed with covid 19. The teacher Mrs Lipkin told my sister she has to go to school or she's fail the class.

There are multiple people who have gotten covid in the school and the teacher Mrs lipkin called and told the students don't tell anyone you have covid. And is forcing everyone who has been around the infected students to come to class. Very very dangerous and unacceptable.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I graduated from the Dental Assisting program in 2005. 15 years later I decided to move out of state and come to find out they are not a CODA credited which is needed for the National Board to transfer my license out of state...
And of course when asked about it they wanna play stupid.
As for the course itself they allow let anyone pass,  Whether you put in the work or not.
So it sucked for the ones that worked hard and took it serious!
Guess they are just worried about being paid!< /Text>

Happy to have not chosen this school! Just received a phone call from them after submitting my information online for info  months ago and I’m mid sentence stating I am no longer interested, they rudely hung up the phone. >>> If they treat you like this before ever setting foot on the school, I can’t imagine how they would treat you when you become a student. Unprofessional! Says a lot when you don’t have the patience or tolerance for others.<//text>

<Review>Honestly the best choice i made was enrolling back into school I'm a mother of 3 Children when first coming into the UEI, The Reps were amazing helping me fill my paper work getting in fast and out due to the fact that i have my babies with me, the next day finical aid was quick and great they had the patients everything and very helpful.
Coming to the first day of class i was nervous Once The Instructor came to introduce her self she was very pleasant and nice, once in the classroom she introduce her self and gave a brief about her self  i felt that i had made the right Choice in Choosing the MEDICAL INSURANCE BILLING AND CODING program MS, Lipkins honestly is the best teacher for this program very hands on and detailed about what opportunities we have and  what the exceptions are I'm lucky to her as my instructor who's willing go beyond her to help understand the program, while having a good time in class ....<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Ghetto! The school is falling apart inside.  Cracked floors and ceilings not enough supplies half the time. Paying 20,000 to listen to teachers that lack professionalism and being surrounded by students who don’t really care about their future and lack common qualities that a decent human being can easily obtain. I felt like I was surrounded by immature, ghetto degenerates.</review><Time>1589386672026</Time><rate>2</rate><Pics>None<//Pics><username>Sydney Yacono< /username><Gmap_id>0x80c2972304f6146b:0x4baa1f3821b29661<//Gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>108819696575090905305< /user_id></record>

I recently graduated from the HVAC classes. Mr. Vartanian and Mr. Boodanian have been great instructors. Both are extremely knowlegable of the field and keep class exciting and relevant.</text>

As a student born in East LA, I am attending the campus in Huntington Park. During my first few months in H.P we had to substitute Mr. Budanian for our HVAC program. So he accepted and worked both campuses day and night. He has by far exceeded what i thought he can teach me, he has ways of explaining and demonstrating what he is teaching far better than any teacher I've ever had in my life hands down. I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. V at a convention in Pasadena and was able to have a very detailed conversation with both regarding HVAC and can honestly say that they know so much and you can learn alot from them both. I would like to thank the Encino campus for the opportunity and all I can say is that IF YOU WANT SOMETHING IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO WORK "HARD" FOR IT AND GIVE IT EVERYTHING YOU GOT BECAUSE ITS NOT GONNA LAND ON YOUR FEET, AND AS HARD AS PEOPLE MAKE IT SEEM WITH NEGATIVE COMMENTS JUST KNOW THAT PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN FAMILY WILL SAY THE SAME SO IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN YOURSELF THE ONLY THING HOLDING YOU BACK FROM SUCCESS IS YOU!</text>

Waste of Time and Money. They say anything to get you past 14days. Then you have to pay. No way out. I was failed out due to not enough hours. Knowing i have kids and them promising everything will be okay. 7 months later they advised me not enough hours will not pass.  so i did not Fail classes just not enough hours. Terrible place to go for schooling

1 star ... there was nothing else lower</Review>

I came to this school expecting to get my moneys worth but ended up learning nothing. I had gone in expecting to get a good education and what i got was a teacher who was at best mediocre. I had spent about 7 months with him and all we did was watch movies. One of my fellow classmates had gone to complain about this and he got upset with us for "lying". Thankfully he left but that left so little time for me to actually learn things properly with the teachers who actually cared and that weren't just there to collect a paycheck. To them i say thank you but to the school as a whole i say shame on you for hiring people who obviously don't care about the students. If they could hire more people like Rivera and Rosales it would be a magnificent learning opportunity. This campus/business shouldn't need to tell their students to go on this page and write good reviews it should come from themselves. This place ranks low for a reason. Listen to us please because we want to save your time and money.

Some of the students are too problematic and too rude. Some of them still have the mentality of a 3 year old and think that violence and talking smack is the answer. They argue and hate each other for the dumbest reasons. In the work environment there are things that should not slide like racism and ignorance and if they allow students like that to go there and they hear complaints and just say that "that's just how (P/N) is "  then they honestly should rethink who they let in. It is a small enough school to keep track of the students so I believe there really is no excuse.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2972304f6146b:0x4baa1f3821b29661< /gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>107508719946205640543</user_id>< rating>

I have told numerous “representatives” of UEI that I’m not interested in their programs, yet the calls continue to flood in. Needless to say even if I was in search of furthering my education, the last place I would ever consider is this desperate organization. They prey on individuals who they perceive are people who are in such desperate need for hope/direction/education that they will pay whatever money for degree or certificate that no company on this planet would take seriously. Saying you graduated from UEI is the equivalent of saying you’re the smartest kid in your homeschool courses. For the love of God, don’t let these people scam you out of your money for an education that will put you right back at the McDonald’s they promised to steer you away from.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I loved my experience here and no one is paying me to say this. I went to for the medical billing and insurance coding program. I got the easiest teacher, DR. I (that's his preferred name). He was more lectures than text book work. Other student told me they were swamped in their text book, i couldn't relate. I feel like i need to defend this school because I became successful in the career i choose but that is because of ME. Everyone I know that came here is disappointed they don't have a job... but they were never there at Job club when i went everyday at 11 am. I didn't see them ever use help making a resume or i never saw them use the free internet to apply to jobs. UEI will put in a good word for you if you APPLY YOURSELF. I use to get 4 interviews a week! Yea there is a large loan to borrow but i don't even notice my monthly payments. My foot is in the door to the career I'm going for so all is well. So for all the bad reviews... did you apply yourself before blaming your teachers, counselors.< /review>

The staff at the frount desk have been so unbelievable rude, even when I ask for a simple question. All they do is give attitude and sit their gossiping. Form a buissnes aspect they should all take a cours to learn how to be a professional. The bathroom smell and theirs constant uren on the seats and on the floor in the womens bathroom. The parking lot is to small and my car has been hit and scrached plenty of times, and when I ask the staff to check the cameras they look like If I'm crazy. Theirs constant shortage of paper and supplies. For the amount of money I'm spending on this school its so not worth it.</Review>< Pictures>

Worst orientation EVER went to find out about the Dental program everything was cute and nice till they tried to give me a tuition of 17,000 when I requested paper work that showed me where all the money was going the dean became pissed with me and said ”doctors dont become doctors by not spending money” I couldn’t believe it, you know for scrubs that look like and feel like  paper bags i dont think 3000 dollars is a fair price. And the dean is money hungry my advisor had a completely different career before going into finacial aid and was just embarrassing.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>(Criminal Justice/Fraud) MUST READ

The Criminal Justice program is very boring, you'll sit in class,go through slides, do simple question work, and take quizzes every Friday. Keep in mind this program is not hands on as they say when their trying to talk you into signing up. one module, out of the 9 months your there is hands on, and one field trip throughout the 9 months your there ; do not let the counselors tell you otherwise.

Your suppose to get your CPR, and Guard Card before you graduate and most of my classmates has graduated with neither, and is still waiting for both their guard, and CPR Card.

The Guard Card process is very backwards, they have you take the test, finger print you, than you have to wait weeks before they have you fill out the application, when your suppose to take the test, fill out the GC application first, then get finger printed. Everything is spaced out months apart,Which is why students have to wait such long periods until they receive their GC.

This school is all about their money point blank period. The counselors tell you lies just to get you in the door for their commissions sake. I wish I would've spent the $19,000 I had to pay on a University, because UEI definitely wasn't worth my time, nor money.

The directors were really nice, and did their best to accommodate me. It was just too late.<//review>< pictures>

This school’s 20k 9 month  HVAC program is a Joke, you can get better  education on youtube for free, the EPA universal certificate can be had for under $100 and 2 hours studying.<//review>

<text>I had a great compassion for science and studying and education and going to college and ultimately to university , but unfurtunetly this college ruined my dreams and left me with nothing but loans .I used to go to community college and I was successfull in studying Even though I was working part time and I had a terrible situation.I wasted my time and my energy and my money for the degrees that I got, these degrees have been good for no where but the trash bine I was hopping to have a career and become a profitional but this college destroyed my dream and my son's future and because when I was in California this college did not help me with job and after 1 year of my graduation I relocated to another state because of job and because of of low salary and not having a proper job my son is in foster care, with a lawyer I will sue this College and those employer and co-workers that abused me at my job and  eventually there will be justice.</text>< pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) A star is too much the experience was a bit unpleasant I graduated with honors and it did not work until now I do not go a job I continue in factories and taking care of babys there are teachers who give diplomas only to people who like them or bring gifts to them the credits I got it because of my effort I do not speak English very well but in my class there were people who did not speak English and were students of the month ... they went out and still they were granted the credits to graduate and work but I still pay my debt and that my title serves one more adornment in my wall of assistent doctor my teacher was mrs.Rodríguez.

(Original)
Una estrella es demasiado la experiencia fue un poco desagradable yo me gradué con honores y de nada sirvió hasta ahorita no te go un trabajo  sigo en fábricas y cuidando babys hay maestros que dan diplomas sólo a personas que les caen bien o les llevan regalos los créditos que obtuve fueron gracias a mi esfuerzo no hablo bien el inglés pero en mi clase había personas que ni una frace en inglés y salían estudiantes del mes ..faltaban y aún así se les otorgó los créditos para graduarse  y trabajo pero sigo pagando mi deuda y de que sirve mi titulo un adorno más en mi pared de assistent medico mi maestra fue mrs.Rodríguez.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<user>101775831323587734433</user><text>This place has had its ups and downs for sure. I have been going here for along time. When it was over by the Mervyns on Story Road(to give a sense of time). I havent ever had any problems while shopping here for my aquatic needs. The people there seem to know their stuff still and are usually pretty helpful. I go there to buy feeder fish for my duck. She has not been sick from their fish so I feel it is a decent place to pick up things. They also have a pretty odd selection of "birds" and reptiles. They have regular love birds and morning doves, things of that nature, but I also have seen chickens, roosters and quail. Very off selection... the reptiles seem to be doing fine there and seem to be healthy. Go check them out on Alum Rock and White Road next to the Starbucks.< /text>< resp>

Call for a Maltese grooming, they said no problem $65.00. Show up, they only shave, Maltese Come out looking like a Chihuahua!!!!’  took them 3.5 hours for the poor job, at the time to pay from $65.00 went to $95.00 due to fee’s and taxes. If you are looking for a nice grooming do not take your pets here, if you are looking for a poor job this is the right place.< /Review>

This place is terrible do not buy your animals or supplys from here! First off the second you walk in there is a terrible smell, not just the usual pet store smell but a turn your stomach almost have to walk right back out but I didn't want to be rude kind of smell. So then you start looking around and you realize that a large portion of their fish are pretty sick, you can visabaly see the mites crawling all over the the reptiles, especially one poor, poor bearded dragon, and the birds are overcrowded and look very unkept...😭 Not only that but most of the supply items for sale were covered in layers of dust and cobwebs which says to me that a lot of the animal food for sale is probably way past expired. All in all not a place I'd ever want to walk into again!</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I couldn’t breathe due to the smell. The poor rats were cramped in plain acrylic tanks and also the guinea pigs were being housed in a tiny cage WITH RABBITS ALSO WITH THEM. I found a cage that retails for $30 at Petco, but the same exact cage is being sold there at 100% MORE. The selection is terrible which leads me to believe that they buy all of their stock themselves. Animals shouldn’t be bought here no matter how healthy they are</Review>< pics>

How is this place not shut down... Just bought a rat and its missing an eye and is constantly sneezing because he was living in pine wood chips. All of your animals are suffering. Please fix your situation or you will get in serious trouble.</text>

Went in looking for aquarium plants. Very poor selection, but the smell was so overpowering, I'm sure there was a dead animal in the store. Everything is under a thick layer of dust.  I bought a planting tool and asked him to clean it up, which he did with his shirt. 👎👎👎< /text>

Disgusting. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Cramped. Smelly.  Staff is not attentive. Walked in the back and there is a leopard gecko that is almost dead and they'd charging 70 dollars. You can see its back bone and its tail was almost non existent its so skinny.. sickening.<//Text>

<Review>Words can not describe how horrible this place is, the incompetent staff is extremely unfriendly as if they don't want you there, and that's just the beginning. The poor defenseless animals at this disgusting place are dying, the once beautiful reptiles are a pale malnourished shade of eminent death. The fish are covered in ick looking like someone sprinkled a large amount of salt on them, only it's dozens of parasites killing them, I counted 4 dead fish in total in the fish tanks and many more looking close to death. This is not a pet store, this is where animals are come to die. I do not know how this scum of a "store" is still open. Don't go to this place unless you just want to witness animal cruelty with your own eyes.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Yeah I'd second the rude staff, I walked in and thought there were customers present and felt I was interrupting a conversation, it was just the workers. It was awkward, and I greet people pleasantly upon entering their shop. Even though it's a small shop it felt like they had just opened, and had hardly any selection.

For me the dealbreaker is the worst store credit I've ever recieved for bringing stock in, even super seedy places like 6th Avenue in San Francisco gave me twice the value for my fish anywhere else you go, you will get more $/fish.

Didn't ruin my day, but considering how many much better shops there are, this place is definitely not worth your time.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcd6ddf94c2f7:0xf148d829c7c6b9ea< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had gone in two weeks ago, and asked about pricing for a Pair of Parakeets, I was given 29.99. Now today when I called TOTALLY DIFFERENT! 50, if I want two birds. The guy was so incredibly rude, practically yelling. To say I was disappointed would be an understament.<//Review>

It's an okay park. The pool looks fun. The only reason we haven't swam there is we have a pool. My kids have a good time there. The only downside is that there's no bathroom when the pool isn't open.<//review>

They took out that thing that the bigger kids used to jump off of from way up high. There is also a thing that makes sounds like wolves and other animals, that my 2 and 3 year old boys just love!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x809ace35ea111757:0x9f5ca599cf7df315< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was screamed at by the cashier for being unable to tell which station my car was from an awkward angle with unintuitive signage. See picture. They only accept debit cards and cash, which was very inconvenient for me.<//review>< pics>

<text>I had an issue with the pump reading my debit card, so I did it a second time. They authorized several HUNDRED DOLLAR authorizations from the first swipe, and corrected for part of it. After about 15 mins, it had been corrected to authorizing an $80 purchase (which I DID NOT), I went inside and spoke to the cashier and she said she doesn't see that $80 purchase in their system. Tells me that the money would be returned. A week later, it's still not corrected and my bank says it is posted and went through. They also commented that it was suspicious seeing all these authorizations that I didn't approve, even though most were corrected. Now I need to file a dispute. I was a repeat customer but will not be returning now.</text><response>None</response><Name>Ashley Davie< /Name><user>100310578796972861019</user>< Rate>

Small acts of kindness hold so much currency, and I have been the fortunate recipient of many such gifts from the generous mechanics and storekeepers at this Mountain View ARCO location over the past few years. Today, they helped me fill air in my tires when I couldn't get the public gauge to work. In the past, they've helped me with a faulty car battery, and even helped me find assistance when I lost my keys. They have systematically insisted on being of service, and so I insist on sharing a glowing review. Thank you for bringing human back to business. I am grateful, thank you.<//text>

You can't beat their huge discount for paying in cash! 50 cents a gallon cheaper than other gas stations in neighborhood. Sweet deal!</text>

This is the closest disco not station in relation to my work. On the corner of this intersection there are three gas stations that sell Chevron and this Arco and the Sheldon the Chevron are commonly priced about the same and generally they are closed anywhere from 10 to 30 cents a gallon cheaper in each category. So that's a good thing the downsiders I have had a couple problems either with the money not getting put on to the right pump and trying to get a corrected or I'm not getting put on at all and then the cashier insisted that I already pumped it and definitely some language breakdown between us on those occasions that I had some difficulty at the pump. So something that should have been a simple solution to correct because this is the business that they're in turned out to be more deal that I wanted to deal with generally after a shift at work where I have a very physically challenging job usually on my way home but I digress. The other knock is that the convenience store part is just a tiny little Snack Shack and really has no relevance. Typically if I want something to drink for Nosh on I have to make a second stop on the way home. So all in all it's a perfectly decent place to get gasoline without really any in much of this has on service or alternate products there is a automotive repair shop there but I don't have any information to review that one.< /Text>

<text>The prices here are mid-range for the area. It is situated on the corner of Regansdorf & Middlefield, a very busy corner. There is a very small (closet sized) store for soda and cigarettes. One strange thing: they do not sell menthol cigarettes. I even went to the gas station across the street, and they don't sell menthol cigarettes either. They both will sell all other types/brands, just not menthol.</text><Name>David Reiss</Name>< Time>

Relatively high gas prices for Arco, but considering the area and overhead expenses, I guess it's reasonable to some level.< /text>

I went in there with a knocking and scraping sound coming from my left driver's front axle. I thought that it was due to a serious problem. However they told me that it was due to having a unauthorized brake pad installed which had slipped out of place. They replaced the brake pad at the most reasonable price I have encountered while having my brakes serviced. I have had no problems with my brakes since then.

Thank you for the great service.< /Text>

<Text>This Arco is on the corner of Shoreline and Middlefield.  They have the most reasonable gas prices for miles and a little mechanic shop with the best rates for service that I've found.  The shop staff are nice, honest Vietnamese men and a nice Latin girl is at the front register.< /Text><Name>Susan Delly< /Name>< Time>

this is actually kind of uncanny for me but I have gone to Arco before and really drag them across the coals because of the $0.35 up charge that they always charge you no matter whether you're paying debit or credit they always charge it well turns out they have the best gas prices up here out of all the different gas locations and I think that that's strange because in San Diego it's totally the opposite.</Text>

<Review>Best Mexican food place in Tehachapi. I recommend their meat fries! Choice of meat over fries with cheese, cilantro, and onion. A mask by itself. Great food.<//Review><name>Luke Vee<//name>< UserId.>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I stopped off here to get lunch today. The drive-through was pretty busy so I parked and went inside. The inside is very nice and clean and they have tables where you can sit and eat at.
The menu here is pretty simple. I ordered a Carnitas burrito with a Coke. The burrito is pretty good size and I have to say the Carnitas was done with perfection. It was flavorful and  it really hit the spot.</Review>< pics>

Love this new place.   Great food, more authentic mexican style.  Breakfast burritos, small but tasty tacos, giant burritos, other specialties.  Quick service, friendly staff, reasonable prices.  Worth a visit.</review>

Love the chorizo burrito. Staff super friendly. Waited awhile in the drive thru (10 min) but the staff apologized. I was in a hurry to work so it seemed longer.  But well worth it. Burrito was excellent.</Text>

Similar to places like King Taco down in LA. Our go to spot when craving a burrito or street tacos. Love the carnitas. Green salsa is so good. It isn't too spicy and is a lot tastier than the red. The Potato taco is new and pretty good. I added some carnitas to it from my street taco and it was really good.</Text>

this is the second time I come to this town so my husband was eyeballing this restaurant we decided to go by looks because it looked very clean but the food was terrible and I tasted bad Mexican food but they surpassed it. I got four tacos altogether two al Pastor and two chorizo they literally look the same and they look like they were dipped in red food coloring and the taste was so off it look like cat food. Only way I can describe it was if you buy $.99 fake chorizo that’s what my husband said. His burrito had hard chunks of meat and it was not good, besides the waiting they forgot some stuff, I honestly believe all the positive comments on here are people from the restaurant. Eat at your own risk.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Everything is made fresh to order, always hot and DELICIOUS! I had one of each of their meat choices on a taco and every single one was exceptional, but my favorite was the carnitas. I tried the horchata, and OMG they said it was made fresh every day and I beleove it! Best I've ever had. Everyone was so understanding and helpful as well as cheerful, even thought they had a bit of a line on the first day I was still out in 40 minutes. Go try them out!< /text>

<Text>Good food. We waited in the drive through line that nearly went to the street, but they still gor us through fairly quick. We ordered tacos & burritos for the family. Everyone loved their food. My Asada Burrito was made with red sauce and I added the red salsa. I like hot salsa and let me tell you, it’s HOT. The green sauce is mild and has good flavor so that was the choice for my kids. We had Asada, Pollo, Cabeza, and Al Pastor. Everything was good!</Text>< rating>

Fantastic Mexican food! It was worth the long wait, because the carne asada fries were just what I needed. They were out of Horchata, so we went with a Pina instead and it was so good. My hot sauce loving husband agrees that the red sauce is HOT so use it with caution. I will be back! Thank you Tacos el Superior for bringing your great food to Tehachapi.<//review>

They arent kidding when they say "superior"! This place is amazing. The prices cant be beat and the service us legitimately kind and friendly. The condiments are bomb (green salsa and lime!) and the cabeza tacos are SO good. Glad I found this place as I will be back again and again.<//Review>

The food is not to bad, however WAY over priced for the small portions. No exaggeration... the tacos are literally 2 bites. At 2 dollars a taco that's 1 dollar for a bite. Wow...</text>

Tacos El Superior has great food. I enjoyed the nachos immensely because the chicken was tender and well seasoned.... the nacho cheese was perfect. My daughter gobbled up her carne asada fries so I assume they were great as well. Although they have a drive thru, we were pulling a trailer so opted to order inside. Our cashier Trevor was really helpful and friendly.< /Review>

Burrito al pastor was exceptional. I got it without pineapple. Carne asada burrito was average. Red salsa is hot, green is mild. I hope they will make a spicy green and mild red salsa for the future. Definitely will come back!< /Review>

<Review>The food is great! Really enjoyed the asada burrito!

The red salsa had a flavor that I really did not enjoy, Chipotle flavor maybe? The red salsa has a little kick. I imagine that this red sauce will be very spicy for most people.

The green salsa was super interesting and odd tasting. I decided after a few bites that I really enjoyed it but I don’t think it’s for everyone.

The tacos are small, but they are meant to be small, They are like street tacos. They are delicious and definitely worth the price. For less than 2$ Each, you can’t go wrong with a few of these tacos.

I like the simple menu.

The staff is nice and helpful.

Check your bag before you leave, they forgot to give us salsa and other sides that we ordered.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>I’m debating on the 3 stars. The food is good the cashier is so friendly. But there is always something missing. They assure you with “everything is in your bag” which I recommend to double check before leaving the window. They need more attention to detail I paid for my sides and when I got home nothing. The guacamole is so expensive and for them to charge you and not give it to you is shameful! I have given it a few tries and it’s the same problem every time! It’s not just that you ask for extra salsa but your order is never complete. My advice: CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE LEAVING THE WINDOW!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c1f7a721194e7f:0x169d9d9729723a39< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Yes!! Do not be put off by the crazy, long line. Get in line, relax, think happy, delicious thoughts. Never had anything we didn't like here, but we keep coming back for the burritos. One word of warning: I unwrap the burritos AS SOON as I get home! They get so soggy and it breaks my heart. Otherwise, I'm in love. Asada and carnitas are go-tos.< /review>

Authentic street tacos served here (and close to home no less). If you're expecting a crunchy, lettuce filled,  tortilla chip cradled, meat by-product filled...thing, go to Taco Bell down the road. The cabeza is great, the al pastor is great. I'm gonna drive my ever growing butt over to El Superior right now actually... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.</Review>

This place is amazing. Their pastor tacos with pineapple chunks are so delicious. The cabeza and the carnitas are great as well. And for less than 2 dollars a taco... you really can’t beat it. Oh, and the red sauce has great flavor and is super spicy.< /text>

<review>The carne asada fries are a must try! I was so impressed with the flavor and the warm cheese is the cherry on top! The amount they gave was exactly what I needed, enough to share between two people! The agua de pina (pineapple) is so fresh too! You can tell the ingredients are top quality. Highly recommend!<//review>< Pictures>

If you're looking for a 'King Taco like' experience (socal folks should know what I'm talking about) then you will be disappointed.  Meat quality, especially the asada, is fair at best.  Have been 2-3 times and the meat has a lot of gristle; consistency of cheap flank steak.  Perhaps if they chopped the meat more at the prep station they could get away with serving lower quality meat, but hey....   tacos can be a bit greasy, too.  On a positive note, nice to have a better fast food option in town over 'wanna-be mexican' Taco Bell and 'constantly closing due to failing health code violations' Del Taco.

If you want a really good, authentic Mexican fast food experience, I recommend King Taco in LA over this place, but for those stuck in Tehachapi, this place will work in a pinch.<//Review>

I feel like it's the in and out of Mexican food... Their menu is short and sweet The only reason it didn't get five stars is it takes quite a while in the drive-thru overall good food great service!<//Text>

They use beans and rice in their burritos as a filler so when ordering a carne asada burrito I was expecting just that, a carne asada burrito. Instead I got a bean and rice burrito with very few pieces of meat. If I had wanted a bean burrito with rice I would have ordered one. Not worth it to me.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Time>1600317536908</Time><review>Apparently they care less about customer satisfaction/service. Case in point we were anxiously awaiting them to open and they were extremely busy, so we waited a bit and last Monday I saw the line at half of its recent length so I said let's do it. After a 45 minutes to an hour wait in the blistering heat we made it to the front where the worker asked for our receipt again before handing over anything to us as she said to be sure our order is correct, we asked if this was everything and we were assured twice it is and was. Well after driving home 20 miles plus we start unpacking to eat but the six tacos I ordered with all the other items were nowhere to be found but grease was oozing out everywhere, on the straws and napkins allover every item and pooled inside the bag too. I was going to drive back but instead opted to call them (big mistake), the phone was a busy signal for hours until I gave up frustrated. The next morning I called and left a voicemail which the message promised would be returned in 24-48 hours, well now I've left three voicemails but have called like twenty times, apparently they can care less, because if this is their way of caring or responding in a timely manner it is sad. I have lost all want to do business with this place, if I could give less then a star I would. If you enjoy not even getting what you pay for, and having grease permeating every item in your bag this is definitely the place for you! I will do my part to spread the word about the total lack of response and care given to my family and order (i gave them a couple days to make it right, but no response whatsoever!?!). Except for the absolute lack of concern for my issues and more grease then I have ever seen in my fifty years of life on one meal there is nothing superior about this place at all....</review>< UserId.>

<Review>Was there yesterday, what a farce, i ordered a sope and was served a 5" fried masa with a very small brushed slather of beans. I promptly went inside and returned with receipt. My husband had a carnitas SALTY burrito, awful. This is NOT mexican nor is there any quality.</Review>< time>

Flavor is good but they get your order wrong half the time. Also, tacos are really small and the quesadilla hardly had any meat for the price.</Text>

I went here Thursday 10-22-2020. I got a pretty big order consisting of 3 burritos, 24 tacos, 2 casidilla's and an order of asada fries. The food is pretty good. The service was definitely cool. Went through the drive through and waited about 15 min in total to get my order. For the price however, I think I would rather go to taco samich. I think the food is good here but didn't wow me at all.<//review>

My favorite meat is the al pastor and the carnitas. Definitely a need to try. One of the better things to come in to this little mountain town.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>The line handling is terrible and the communication isn't very accurate it seems. Even when it is, there's always something wrong with the order. It's honestly sad, there's potential in this place food-wise but the handling of orders on top of the wait times make it worth more to head on over to Del Taco instead.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Food was pretty good. Husband got some el pastor and chorizo tacos, and I got asada fries. Asada fries were tasty, but different, because of the nacho cheese. I liked it, husband wasn't a fan. Neither of us really liked the chorizo tacos, however, my husband agreed, the El Pastor was pretty good. The only real complaint we had, is that the tortillas were soggy. Will definately return to try more things on the menu.</review>

I was hoping the long lines and hype were a promising sign that this place was going to be awesome. As it turns out, my first impression was ..... eehh. Seems like another mediocre Mexican place to me. That said all I tried was an asada burrito. I can't speak for a large majority of their other food, but for my "go to" order that I semi regularly get from toco samich down the road its just not great.

It should be said that the people were very nice and the waiting time was not unreasonable. They did however forget to give me my $4 horchata, although I myself didn't realize till I got home so...

I will try some other stuff to be fair, but I'm not holding my breath. TACO SAMICH's same burrito is Way better...< /Text>

I used to drive down all the way to their 10th st location almost every weekend because the food is that good! The wait when they opened was a little long due to the line being all the way to the fast trip but it is sooooooo worth the wait! Definitely eating here often! My favorite items are the carnitas nachos and their desserts. The piña superior is like nothing I’ve had before. And the flan you have to try the flan. Also the aguas! This place is delicious!< /Text><GmapID>0x80c1f7a721194e7f:0x169d9d9729723a39< /GmapID></record>

Pros:
Simple menu
Decent quality
Heavy on sauce
Local

Cons:
Not worth drive thru wait
Staff simply not equipped for drive thru

Overall, better than Taco Bell and Del Taco, but basic as it gets.</Review>

Their "tacos" are the size of my thumb, and almost 2 bucks each. What a complete joke. I laughed in their faces.</Review>

Good tacos, but overpriced!  We waited in line for 45 minutes.  We won't be back, especially since there's no vegetarian option.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Okay I tried this place so I thought their taco truck in Lancaster is bad with their dried up tacos the salsa was okay but this place is worse how can it get worse I don't know it's pretty sad that taco Bell's better than this place it's supposed to be Mexican tacos no salsa no guacamole the worst tacos I've ever had

Okay I tried this place so I thought their taco truck in Lancaster is bad with their dry tacos, the sauce was fine, but this place is worse, how can it get worse? I don't know, it's pretty sad that Taco Bell is better than this place. They are supposed to be mexican tacos without salsa without guacamole the worst tacos I have ever eaten

De acuerdo, probé este lugar, así que pensé que su camión de tacos en Lancaster es malo con sus tacos secos, la salsa estaba bien, pero este lugar es peor, ¿cómo puede empeorar? No sé, es bastante triste que taco Bell sea mejor que este lugar.  se supone que son tacos mexicanos sin salsa sin guacamole los peores tacos que he comido</review>

<review>The Alameda farmers market is a nice bike ride or walk from anywhere on the island. With the new addition of pop up tents and little stores for fun items like plants, stickers, jewelry and witchcraft (feathered outlaw) it is bigger and brighter. Always has great produce and dairy and has a great atmosphere.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

My favorite local farmers market. A diverse group of vendors with plenty of selection and friendly faces. The hummus stand, tamales, and Bright Farm veggies are my favorite. They also have gorgeous a flower stand with affordable and fresh flowers. Definitely recommend if you’re in the area! Every Saturday and Tuesday.</text>

This market is open Tuesdays and Saturdays.  We go Tuesdays since I go to another market Sundays.    Alameda Farmers Market is a small market with good produce choices.   The farmers seem to be stable with good prices.  That is, same farmers show up each week.   Prepared food vendors are less stable with relatively frequent turn over.   It's really nice there is a market manager there each week and is visible.  Good place for children.< /text>

<review>This farmer's market is a little on the small side, but still will give you a good experience on a Saturday morning. I particularly like the juice stand, and the orchids are particularly stunning. Most of the food is great, too!

Good variety, reasonable pricing. Walk the whole line before you buy. The flower seller at the far end and baker (on the food side) are especially good.<//review>

I may be biased because I expected low prices at the farmer's market but this was not the case. The organic product prices at Trader Joe's is the same if not cheaper. I did enjoy the vegetable, eggs, and fruit I bought but will not return to the market soon.</Text>

<Review>Small market with plenty of choices for Asian vegetables, seasonal fruit, eggs, honey, preserves, baked goods, flowers. There's usually live music,  prepared foods, and specialty items like kefir and cheese.< /Review>< Pictures>

La Farine is no longer there. Only okay, and less than okay in winter and spring.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Small but delicious market of country products: fruit, vegetables, cakes and other rustic delicacies. A real panacea for those who are always forced at the supermarket. The flavors are definitely more alive and genuine and in the end the costs are not so different. The atmosphere is typically American, made pleasant and perfect by the relaxing country-style music of a good street guitarist who has not neglected to dedicate a couple of Italian songs, with great kindness.

(Original)
Piccolo ma delizioso mercato di prodotti di campagna: frutta, verdura, torte e altre delizie agresti. Una vera panacea per chi è costretto sempre al supermercato. I sapori sono decisamente più vivi e genuini e alla fine i costi non sono poi tanto diversi. L'atmosfera è tipicamente americana, resa piacevole e perfetta dalla musica rilassante un po' country di un bravo chitarrista ambulante che non ha trascurato di dedicarci un paio di canzoni italiane, con grande gentilezza.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

ERI always has great customer service. They have been flexible with our shops hours, and they have always come through with our scheduled pick up times. They’re employees are friendly and we always feel confident handing off our equipment to them.</Review>

My boss put me in charge of researching to find the best data destruction provider in advance of a major upgrade we were planning for our many governmental offices throughout the county. I did not have to do too much research because everywhere I turned pointed to ERI. We have their services scheduled for each location and my boss and I are both 100% confident about it. I even got a “good job” from him!<//review>

When our hospital used them for data destruction, we had hundreds of devices that needed to be dealt with. They did this securely and with great efficiency without disrupting our very important day to day operations. Furthermore they really did a fantastic job of maximizing our resale value.< /Review>

As a business owner it is crucial to keep all of my vital information from being stolen and getting into the wrong hands. ERI’s service is as hassle free as it gets. They pick up any equipment that we are ready to do away with, recycle it, and ensure full wiping of any information.</review>

Being part of a large insurance company, we contacted ERI the first time we needed to accomplish a large electronics disposition after I took charge. I wanted to find out exactly what level of compliance applied to us. I knew it would be strict based on our industry but wanted to learn of all the ins and outs. I got my education and we have been using ERI without a care in the world over the safety of the privacy of our customer base ever since.</review>

While we were in quarantine, my company provided everyone with cell phones and tablets. When we were able to move back into the office, we needed to recycle the extras. ERI had the best solution with their recycling through mail. We ordered a flat rate box and were able to collect the equipment over time.< /review>

I am in charge of everything electronics-related for our entire large school district. I would not want to be the one responsible for our students learning that our e-waste was found overseas somewhere. ERI ensures that will never happen and also helps us to organize collection events.</Text>

An environmental service by definition, it only makes sense that when we are in need of data destruction for our electronics, we are only going to work with a company who does that properly and sustainably. ERI is and always has been that company.< /Review>

It was a tough choice admitting that it was time to close my small business. I had equipment that I knew could be recycled, but also needed to have data removed. ERI has the most secure electronics asset disposition program. They are efficient and I didn't have to worry about my clients' information being compromised.< /text>

I am so happy with the effectiveness of ERI in the destruction of my business' old computers and monitors. The pick up was scheduled within just a couple of days and entire process was simple. Knowing all the security they have in place gave me confidence that our data was protected.< /Text>

What initially attracted me to ERI is their broad coverage area. I know that no matter what zip code I need service in, they have me covered. I had been using multiple smaller local services and quite frankly, I’m busy. ERI makes my data destruction needs convenient and effortless.< /review>

After some recent unrest in my area, my small business had several electronics that had been destroyed and needed to be properly disposed of. Other owners recommended ERI, so I looked them up and was very impressed with the integrity of their operation. I was able to recycle or destroy everything without having to worry about sensitive data being released.< /review>

My counseling office was expanding and we decided to upgrade to newer computers. HIPAA compliance is of utmost importance and we needed a company who understood this importance to remove our data from the old computers. ERI is the most secure, highest rated data destruction company. I was able to reach my goals because I knew I could trust their competency.</review>

Having zero experience in this area, I sure was glad when a fellow banker said, “call ERI”.

When our insurance company first contracted them, they conducted an assessment for free which gave us an idea of how well our company was doing compliance-wise. That was an eye-opener and we have since made some changes we are proud of. We continue to learn from them and use them for all of our destruction and recycling.<//Text>

I had heard disposing of lithium-ion batteries was risky and dangerous so when we needed to do just that I contacted ERI to get the lowdown. When they told me of multiple instances where improper disposal created fire hazards, I knew right then and there we were going to do all of our disposing with them.<//Review>

My company had a HUGE pile up of laptops and desktops all which was just sitting there taking up space because the hard drives contained propriety information. We went to ERI so that these drives could be properly destroyed while all the other components can be recycled. This company has great customer service with intelligent employees so we will be using them again!< /Text>

When I purchased an old warehouse to expand my business, I found a cache of old equipment, including printers and VCRs. I wanted to remove it all, but there are a lot of regulations I'm not aware of. A fellow business owner told me about ERI, so I gave them a call. I am so impressed with their process of safely removing and recycling everything, including antiquated technology.</Review>

ERI works extremely hard to ensure your E-waste is recycled safely. The employees who handle the E waste are meticulously trained and are always ready to help! In addition, ERI has provided employment for countless of individuals in the Fresno area. These persons have acquired skills and training in E-waste industry that has no doubt enabled them to advance in their career at ERI.</Text>

Although the building our office is located in sponsors a electronic recycle drive once a year, we never felt comfortable with giving them the hard drives from our computer systems as the data can be retrieved. Additionally, a yearly service was not frequent enough for our business needs. Thankfully ERI offers not only computer recycling but data destruction all year round. We make frequent use of their services!< /text>

I just called this business they want 35 cents a pound for electronics.  Now I have some old vintage electronics and vacuum tubes that they might get money for because there's glass involved I'm not going to pay so that they can make money off my recyclable electronics.

UPDATE: 01-25-2018. Although their website says that they'll take alkaline batteries I called them just to verify because I know how b******* people are. She told me she doesn't take regular household batteries that I should try Walmart and their dump bins.

If you want to dump your electronics and save the environment but don't need to make money off of it there's a place in Clovis off the 168 that's open I believe every other Saturday and they'll take all your electronic junk for free. I did it twice and it was hassle-free.< /Text>

<review>This is a generous 4 starts.  I believe 3.5 would be more appropriate.  This is a unique course for San Diego County, as it rolls through chaparral covered hills - reminds me of some of the inland courses in Ventura County. Greens and fairways were generally in good shape.  Most of the traps were apparently under renovation, and were therefore unplayable.   Staff was great, and price seemed fair enough. Worth checking out!<//review>< Pictures>

<date>1449730817217< /date><rating>4</rating><Review>Course is in great shape. The fairways are hard and mowed very low. After a drive, your ball will keep rolling. You'll need to know the course and play the correct side or else your ball will roll into OB even though you thought you hit it down the line. The greens roll very fast. It's very hard so you either need to get good spin or hit it short and let it roll up. I definitely had a challenging time and want another shot at this course.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Had a wonderful experience! My husband and I had our wedding at this venue and loved it. Armando was great help with my wedding and the golf course views just speak for itself! It is a beautiful venue where they can accommodate to your wants and needs. I received so many compliments and I am so glad to have found it. If your looking for outdoor wedding venues this is the place.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< UserId.>

After hitting balls on the range, I was very apprehensive about playing this course.  The range had to be in the worst shape I have ever experienced.  Public was squeezed to one very small area (lessons had a larger area), and the grass was totally torn up.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the course, however.  As everyone says, it is a links style course and quite interesting to play following the natural terrain.  Your ball runs forever!  Believe the comments on the scorecard when they tell you to hit on a certain side of the fairway!  Greens are in really great shape and very tough.  Lots of movement and fairly fast.  Ended up being a great experience.  I would try it again when in the San Diego area.

If it weren't for the driving range, they would have definitely been given 5 stars!< /Text>

Great price for this course. Unfortunately the couse was not well maintained, however it did not really hinder the experience. This course has potential to be a destination if they would keep it pristine.</text>

Enjoyed playing there.  Play there often. Great coarse and rather challenging.   I like to play late morning because some of the people I play with aren't experienced enough (slow play once in a while) and the Club people get pushy trying to hurry us along. If you play often, you will like to play there too!<//Text>

I enjoy this course especially the early tee times. However, lately the weekend guy let's his buddies start on the back 9 right before the early tee times make the turn. The result is a 2 hour front and a frustrating 3 hour back. When asking the guy about it he's a total jerk, offers no apology and no raincheck.</review>

Great golf course with challenging greens and unforgiving fairways.  Make sure you hit it straight because it's tough to find your ball if your not.</Review>

< Review>
Highly recommend Extra Space Storage in El Segundo. I have had one storage unit for over a year and just secured a second one for another family member. I have found Lisa and Mark to be extraordinarily helpful and they make every effort to make the whole experience extremely pleasant! Anytime one is moving, there’s a state of confusion and often frustration and it was absolutely refreshing to deal with the staff at this storage facility. And they’re always helpful when you forget your unit number or how to use the elevator! 😊<//Review>

Super easy and professional to work with. I was assisted by Mark. He was fantastic and made the whole experience very smooth running. We actually showed up before they opened and Mark the assistant manager came in early to let us in. Highly recommend.<//review>

Just recently rented out a unit. It's a great location with east access for any type of storage needs. Nice clean facility with plenty of space to maneuver your belongings through the hall. Push carts conveniently located on every floor. The staff is on top of it !. Very knowledgeable and helpful with everything . They make the signing up process so quick and easy. Best storage location I've been to yet.<//Review>

Lisa was able to set me up with everything I needed over the phone, before I even arrived. The storage space was big and easily accessible. If you’re storing large furniture make sure you ask for a corner unit, otherwise you may not be able to turn your couch/fridge/desk/etc. into the unit. Luckily, Lisa hooked me up with the corner unit without me even asking. I might have been screwed otherwise.

My only other warning to others would be that the parking lot for this location is on a hill. The (free) dollys that they have will often roll away when you try and use them. If you’re unloading large, heavy furniture from a truck then the sloped parking lot might be an annoying problem for you. Otherwise, 10/10!</Text>< Date>

Our dear friends, Skippy and Drew (both former employees at Extra Space Storage) referred us to Lisa as the El Segundo location is not far from us.  Lisa took us on a tour and showed us the unit which is well located and for a great price.  Mark took care of the final touches when we actually finalized the unit.  The facility is clean and both Lisa and Mark were helpful and friendly.  They were very accommodating to us as we had A LOT to move and needed a couple of days to get it done.  We are happy we chose the El Segundo location.<//Review>

I needed space for a brief time.  Extra space was able to help out.  They even helped me helped me to increase capacity when I discovered, I had more than I anticipated.  The lockers were clean and I did not fear for any water or insect damage. Mark was accommodating to my changing situation.  I highly recommend this facility if you need some extra storage.< /review>

Mark, was very accommodating upon my arrival and even followed up with a courtesy call after I booked the unit. He was very detailed with his instructions and very courteous by helping me with my things to my unit. I’m very appreciative of all the support and care of the staff here. And the unit space was perfect for what I needed it for and the facility is very secure.<//text>

Mark was an absolute life saver! He stayed late to help us check-in after hours since we were getting into town late and had to store our belongings the same day. The facility is also very clean, well maintained, and appears very secure. I have used other storage facilities before, but this one is clearly a cut above everything else. I highly recommend it!</text>

I relocate often for work and have had dozens of storage units over the years.  My recent experience with Mark at Extra Space Storage in El Segundo has been by far the best one to date.  Speedy, smooth, efficient transaction -- I highly recommend!</Review>

<user_name>LittenGreenway Enterprises</user_name><date>1591882186337</date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Do not rent here! Unprofessional & uncaring management & a major termite infestation!

The live-in manager, Lisa, is extremely unprofessional & heartless. Mark comes across more caring, giving the impression that everything is well while throwing out friendly recommendations, but he ends up just being a little spy for Lisa reporting to her, snitching & stabbing you in the back! They start out friendly at first when interest is shown in renting a space at their facility. Then like night & day, they suddenly display a terrible uncaring & unfriendly attitude towards renters (once the lease has been signed & things moved in, of course).

I actually loved this facility at first. The property is awesome, there are a wide variety of storage options, multiple entrances & they have extended gate hours. The good qualities, however, are all overshadowed by Lisa's horrendous customer service & uncaring heart. I definitely suggest bypassing this storage option & renting from another more friendly facility. Save yourself from the awful & unfair treatment that Lisa in particular has no problem inflicting on unknowing renters. She behaved this way on several occasions, not only towards me, but also to my grandfather who rented a space, & a good friend of mine who was renting a space here too (both after I had given this facility a good recommendation, my mistake!). I'll share some of my experience below.

FYI:  Another issue that I was witness to is that there were on several different dates, THOUSANDS of what appeared to be flying TERMITES, BREEDING & INFESTING this facility! Not good if you have wooden furniture, paperwork or any other items that may be tasty to termites. Who knows what other nasty critters or bugs are infesting this facility!

Its truly a shame such horrible unprofessional local management operates such a well appointed facility with the potential to be a great storage solution for people in the area! They have a large secure gated underground drive in garage for car storage, an elevated loading dock with roll up door, and they advertise extended hours for access till 10pm. Unfortunately, there are no clocks anywhere to know the time if your phone dies while you are hard at work moving stuff.

Be warned:  if you accidentally run behind & are still present within the facility running late (even if you have been obviously working hard for hours throughout the day & into the evening trying to move your grandfather's household into his just rented space!), the unfriendly live-in manager Lisa will show up with her boyfriend in a confrontational manner & give you a mere 5 minutes to finish moving what normally would be over an hour's worth of items already in the hallway outside the storage unit, (including a washer & dryer!); WITH THE THREAT OF CALLING THE POLICE OTHERWISE!

Totally heartless & unnecessary, she did this instead of just letting me know that I was running late while being more understanding of the situation. She just as easily could have kindly & reasonably allowed me to take the time needed to finish moving everything in with the care my grandfather's things deserve. Instead I had to literally throw everything left frantically haphazard as quickly as I could into the unit. I found this especially cruel considering my grandfather just started renting there & I was at the end of a very long day of the initial move of his entire household. All day her spy Mark had been around, sharing friendly conversation & giving me 'advice.' So they knew how long & hard I'd been working. To add insult to injury, Lisa then went further by changing the gate hours for my grandfather's account. She said we could now only access his storage space until 5pm instead of the 10pm extended hours that were advertised, that everyone else enjoys & that he signed up for. Unbelievable! So rude! We moved my grandfather out that first month & into a more customer friendly facility. For these specific reasons & more, I recommend avoiding this poorly managed facility. Don't be lured in by these charlatans, they'll stab you in the back!< /Text>< pictures>

Lisa is so great! She’s a good person, a friendly host, and both she and Mark gave several customer courtesy calls that made me look forward to moving my things in. They respect the privacy of their tenants and overall hold good values around community. Easy move in process and clean unit. They inspect the units twice a day for break ins or lock changes.<//review>

< Review>
Mark is the man! Had to pack up my apartment last minute and fly home to Detroit for a few weeks and needed to find a local storage unit to store all my stuff- found this location and JUST made it before they closed but Mark still welcomed me in and gave me the best, most thorough run down of how everything worked and showed me my unit and even helped me with some of my stuff! Never making me feel unwelcome or bad for coming in last minute. I was able to make my flight with at least the peace of mind, knowing my stuff was safe and sound waiting for me when I return! Thanks Mark :)<//Review>

<review>The SWEETEST staff. Super helpful AND HONEST! Once I told them about my need and talked about what I was going to store- they recommended I go to the location up the road that had the roll up doors. Will consider moving back to this location once we have thinned out our furniture! If you live in the area- this place is a MUST for storing your extra stuff!< /review><date>1552166381500<//date>< UserId.>

Each time we have dealt with Mark and he has always been so helpful. He always goes the extra mile. Always happy and always cheerful. Rare in business. As I was moving out of the area for the last time, there was Mark again giving me excellent customer service. This time by Lisa as well. She was also extremely helpful. Great team! Great place!  I totally recommend this facility. They treat you like a person not just a storage unit.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I have been renting a storage space at this facility for three years now. I needed to upgrade my storage so I dropped by a couple of weeks ago. Lisa was very friendly, welcoming and greeted me at the door. She answered all of my questions and since I wasn't ready to vacate the storage space that I have previously occupied, she reassured me that there were enough spaces available to upgrade to the next size up and to come back when was ready.

I finally was able to do the move last week. I spoke with Mark this time over the phone to make sure they were open the day after Thanksgiving. Mark, too, was very welcoming and answered all of my question. I told him I needed to upgrade and he toured me the next size up and made sure that it wasn't too far away from my previous storage space so the move wouldn't be difficult. Mark answered all my questions and was so efficient to have all the paperwork ready to go for me to sign. I work nights and had worked the night before and was exhausted, so being able to get all the paperwork done quickly was such a blessing.

In the last three years, I have had no complaints with storing at this facility. It is clean and has extra carts which make moving swift and easy.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I get it, I’m supposed to track when the monthly lease renews but I originally said I wasn’t going to be taking the whole month of March and of course, I got charged in February until March. And there’s nothing the facility can do. I’m not complaining about the service, the facility was just fine. But for LA, if you’re going to charge someone an arm and a leg to store something ($199/ month for a drive up 5 x 10) it’s just bad policy to not even allow your customers time to prorate before the end of a month, it’s based on their “monthly terms.” that’s frustrating for people that literally have moved.<//Review>< rate>

<text>I stopped by a few months ago to rent a unit, and Mark helped me to find one of the appropriate size, explain how to access the unit when the office was closed, and clearly went over the pricing options.  He also helped me when I got lost in the labyrinth of the building and had to call for assistance.  The building itself is well-maintained and the unit I rented is just what I needed.</text>< pictures>

Quick, efficient and friendly.

Space is good; for my specific unit, almost could not be closer to the parking area and elevator. I don't think any units are far at all.

Very convenient location, just a minute off of Sepulveda.<//text>

This is a great facility and the service is exceptional.  I especially want to thank Lisa for helping me with a proration issue due to my travel dates. I stored my car here and will do again on my next big work trip later this year. I will definitely recommend to all my friends. I use the location in Santa Monica for household things. This company is great. Thanks again and see you soon.<//review>

Lisa and Mark are amazing! They made my move in so easy. I signed my lease from a different location and they called me immediately with simple and easy instructions to my parking space since I’m showing up before the office opens. Thanks management of El Segundo for making my experience a great one!</Text>

First let me start by saying I am extremely happy with the service we received from this Facility! The staff was friendly, helpful and made our rental experience flawless. But... there are unfortunately 2 negative things I have to say about this place. First thing is the parking lot. It sits on a slope so the carts constantly roll down unless you have it up against your vehicle while loading/unloading or someone has to hold it.  This makes the transition cumbersome and hard.  The second thing is the elevator.  It will not stay open long enough. If you have multiple things inside that you are trying to get in and out of the elevator, it will shut on you as soon as you step out.  So if you lose it and it closes, odds are it will go back down to the street level or to another floor for someone and all of your things are left there for anyone to grab. Fortunately the area is safe, but even so, if the elevator could be held long enough to get your items out, that would be amazing.  I would give this place 5 stars if those two things were different because the facility itself is very clean, the space we have is in the perfect place and we are overall, very happy :)</text>

This storage building has to be one of the cleanest units I've ever seen with the friendliest staff Mark. Even the restroom was impressive I am such a stickler when it comes to public restrooms. Mark was not only helpful with guiding me to the company storage unit but he would periodically check on me to make sure I was alright because of all the heavy lifting I had to do all by myself. I'd definitely suggest this storage place to anyone and everyone.
Thank you Mark for all your help and making sure I was alright.</text>< Pics>

I have been working with Mark to find the perfect space size and location for me and his knowledge on units helped me pick the right size for all my things. Then when I found my Apt he helped me find a smaller unit to keep the things that didn't fit in my apartment. Mark is friendly, love his smile and best of all he knows his job that helps people find what they need. He is helpful in making sure I am comfortable with the codes and with getting around in the hallways so I don't get lost. The storage area is clean and the hours fit my schedule! Great place to leave your possessions knowing they are in good hands with the staff here.< /review>

<text>Extra Space on El Segundo is convenient [next to LAX], safe, easy to get to [no traffic puzzles], secure, clean, well run and affordable.  I can't say enough about the facility.  However, like all things it is about the people.  The staff here is EXCELLENT!  They are courteous, super helpful, understanding, compassionate and always go out of their way for us.

We do a lot of trade shows in CA and use this facility to store our banners, AV equipment and supplies and it has been the best decision we have ever made.  No more last minute expensive shipping, just store the stuff here until we inevitably need it again.  Thanks Extra Storage for being do amazing!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The office staff at the El Segundo location, Mark and Lisa, are responsive, very professional and extremely helpful. They have positive attitudes and help you figure out what you need. Recently, we had to remove the contents of a flooded basement quickly, and they were quick, supportive and knowledgeable in this pressurized situation. I greatly appreciate working with these good people!<//text>

Came in just before they closed but Lisa was just as helpful and broke everything down for me in minutes.

Very clean facility and it’s in a very safe neighborhood. They also seem to have a good security on premises.

Storage isn't something I would typically review unless I was giving a bad review. This place deserves a great review.

Clean, secure and convenient.

Mark Yob made the process painless. There was an issue day 1 and he fixed it immediately. Initially I thought he was the owner because of his follow up and follow through.

Clean, secure, convenient and great service makes this a 5 star storage facility.</review>

Mark Yob is extremely helpful.  He is very knowledgeable about the storage options and always willing to answer my questions, no matter how important or not.  While there are many storage options available, I would highly recommend Extra Space in El Segundo... and be sure to ask for Mark!</Text>

I was leaving the country for 5 months and had never rented a storage unit before, Mark at Extra Space Storage was kind enough to walk me through the options, the process, the best deal and the auto-pay system. It was easy to get set up, I always felt safe when moving things in and out and the auto-pay and pricing was seamless with no surprise fees as promised. They have hand carts available which makes moving multiple boxes at one time easy. When returning, the move-out process was simple and also just as described with no surprise fees.

This storage facility is very clean and secure.  Every time I visit the staff is cleaning the hallways near my storage locker.  The office staff at the facility is very helpful , friendly, and pleasant to interact with.  The location and facility lay out makes getting access to my storage locker an easy experience when I visit.< /Text>

He showed me how to get to my unit, where the elevators are, and answered all my questions.  The facility is clean, really accessible, and I found a really good deal online.  Highly recommend this facility!< /review>

Lisa , the property manger really went above and beyond for me . During move in , (always a hectic time) Lisa really helped me out by making the experience as expedient as possible.
Then again, she saved my butt by picking up my $500 wetsuit that I had inadvertently dropped when loading my car . So , thankful for her extra effort and responsible behavior. Good to know that she is one of my neighbors in this city . Gotta give this place a look if you can.</Text>

Great option if you need to store something for a short term. I used them after working in the US to store some equipment while I went on holiday. Way cheaper than using a locker near LAX. This storage is 15 min away from LAX. Great service and quick check in!</Text>

I really like the business with this facility. Mark was very helpful, he showed me a couple of available units and suggested me the best one according to my needs. My unit does not have any light at all but the location of it it is awesome. Besides it is in El Segundo very safe city and the facility has lots of security video cameras. I wish it was open 24/7
:) I am happy. Thank you.< /Text>

I am writing in regard to Mark.  We have had  a storage at extra space storage in El Segundo for 6 years.  I would have to give this gentleman, Mark a 10 if you were to score  that high.  He not only is very kind, but also extremely helpful for my husband Murray Rosenblum and myself. He is extremely knowledgeable and efficient in all our interactions with this location.  I cannot praise him enough for helping us while we were there but also during our move to Irvine extra space storage.                        also the girls at our new location, so far a 10.</text>

Very pleased with my decision to store here. The manager, Lisa, was extremely helpful and patient with me during the decision making process. The staff is very attentive to the customers and seem to take pride in what they do. Refreshing. I highly recommend storing here.<//review>

<text>During our home renovation we stored some of our possessions at Extra Space Storage. Loading boxes and furniture into our space was made more convenient using the carts they supplied. Retrieving our possessions was convenient and terminating the rental agreement was easy. I recommend them for your storage needs.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

First time renting, made it super easy to access and walked me through the entire process (without belittling me or making me feel dumb). Lisa was super nice and made me feel at ease.

Thanks Lisa!</text>

I met Marc in el segundo ExtraSp8Storage and he helped me get an even larger unit than b4 well under the price point previously. I am happy where I am and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.

They were most adamant in requesting a Google review, which I don't mind, but seemed a bit urgent.

Regardless, the woman on staff (I think lisa but I forget) helped me find an amazing 10x12 with a roll up door right by the very front elevator. Extremely helpful, very nice and excellent customer service. This will be the third time I've been a customer here and will keep coming back when I need to store stuff in between moving or just for whatever. Beach climate keeps it nice and cool and is the equivalent of climate control which helps keep items in good condition.<//Text>

I never write a review, but the Extra Space Storage in El Segundo, has bent over backwards for me! They have great customer service and they help you in anyway you need...and I am talking about last minute! The best part is, I was there after closing hours and totally forgot the time, and had to call for help because I could not get out! The manager was so nice and explained about the operating hours downstairs and did not lecture me, she let me out. Her staff also has great customer service!! You never find that anymore!! Thank You again!!< /text>

<Review>By far the most professional of the El Segundo storage options I researched.  Prior to move-in, Lisa was communicative and helpful.  The storage space itself is well-priced, clean and  the facility offers all the conveniences one might need (insurance, dollies, locks, tape, etc.).< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b14565cea449:0xabb02dbf0f8119db<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I recently decided to rent a storage unit here as I prepare to move into another place for the meantime. I easily went online to reserve a unit 3 weeks before I actually was aware that i needed one and let me tell you i am glad that I did.
At first i was hesitant that I even really needed one but then a few days later i received a friendly and pleasant service call and reminder for the great staff there Lisa & Mark. They were extremely pleasant , persistent and assisted me with flexible move in dates.

When I finally arrived 3 weeks later, they were happy to see and it was like we hadnt even missed a beat. We laughed and chatted and they made the storage renting process, lock process and moving in process as simple and as easy as possible. I was in and out with in 20 minutes and found the storage unit to be exactly what I needed.

My final advice. Choose this place for your storage needs and you wont be disappointed with Lisa or Marks service or the pricing :)< /Text>< name>

REVIEW UPDATE on March 28, 2019: While Lisa and Mark may be awesome and the storage facility is excellent, there is something horribly wrong with a corporation that fails to be able to return a call, listen to what you are saying, or fail to realize that if they needed help in a way that policy may need to be waived or superseded and that there is a better way than the way they've treat you.
Now that I've had a chance to speak with Kim the So Cal division manager, her "read from the manual" robotic-like repeating of the same "ways they can help" after I've spent almost $40,000 over 30 years of faithfully paying my storage rent obligations is insulting. Yes she listened to me, but she wasn't hearing me. I am 2 months behind and willing to pay it on a payment plan but the refusal to waive any lien or corporate imposed late fees from the account is unconscionable. I also need to get my things out and have chosen to pay my cell phone bill and pay for gas for a friend's borrowed car to get my stuff out but she doesn't car. Not, apparently should she. She has a job to do, much like the Gestapo said they were just following orders. Kim, you sound young. I hope you are so you can learn from this experience and years from now realize how differently you should have handled the situation.  I hope you can sleep at night. If your mother or father were treated with such insulting corporate coldness the way you handled "customer service," I would hope you would empathize with their situation and find a more humane way to conduct "business" and deal with each person respectfullyas an individual and not ripped from a page of your division manual corporate manual. I would hope when corporate reads this they will speak with you further about expanding your customer service "skill set." Shame on you and Extra Space Storage.

My advice: Find another way instead of commercially storing ANYTHING. Sell it or give it away. The storage unit racket is nothing more than a scam.

Original review: Lisa and Mark make what is normally a business transaction into an experience with human interaction and genuine caring and concern. The location is always clean and well maintained.   But it's really a testament to Lisa and Mark treating you with such genuine concern and caring while being very corporate compliant that make this establishment such a 5 star location!< /text>

I found Extra Space Storage online via a discount for a small storage space I was seeking. Upon calling in I spoke with Lisa Jacob, the store manager at the 1017 E El Segundo Blvd. Locatation. Lisa was extremely helpful and kind for the setup process and even had the lock I needed to purchase on site. I would recommend this place to others and I will continue to use them. Thanks Lisa!</text>

Lisa was very helpful in helping get a unit for a month to help me between moves. The location is secure and easy to access. The application process is quick and easy as well as the process for discontinuing rental.</Review>

<text>I decided on this extra space storage facility mainly because of Mark Yob.
Mark, went "above and beyond " to assure I was completely satisfied with the whole process!

This Extra Space facility is:
Clean, and in a crime free part of El Segundo.

I recommend asking for Mark Yob, he's extremely professional!

<Review>This facility is by far the best 🏆"storage facility" I've ever had the pleasure of trusting💁my belongings 👜💼👠👗🏄🏼‍♀️🚲🎧🎤🥊🏹🏀🏈💅to and in.
I was warmly welcomed by Marc at the front desk who thoroughly and simply ran me through costs 💸and acredited me with the monthly discount👍.
He explained everything to me in an easy to understand process🤔.
I have been kindly 😉greeted by a gentle smile from Marc and a "hello" 👋🏻 which provides not only an overall since of 🌅safety- but also a feeling of friends & family.👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
It's only been half of a month that I've been here and I have observed 🌸very clean grounds-hallways and perfect environmental 🌻conditions within the units-elevators- and hallways.
I am very satisfied 🕊with the service/hospitality and storage facility as a whole.👌💯 percent☝🏼.
😺💁very 😁 pleased indeed.
Thank You 👍🙏🏻🌼</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I don't wish to review the business, but one of it's employees.  I have been a loyal renter for over 25 years, and have gone through numerous staff changes, but I have to say that, by far, Dana is the BEST!   She was there years ago, then sadly was transferred, but came back and I was thrilled.  She is kind, helpful and always has a smile on her face.  She greets everyone warmly as they come in and is very attentive.  She truly knows her stuff.  Extra Space is indeed lucky to have someone of her caliber.  Sadly, I have learned that she is once again being transferred, much to my dismay.  My loss is truly someone else's gain.  I will miss her greatly and wish her the best.</Review>

< Review>
After a great deal of research, calling around to different facilities and then touring a few, Extra Space in El Segundo was easily the best choice for me. The onsite manager was extremely professional, helpful and friendly even though he was juggling several other customers and phone calls he made me feel that I was more important than the others.<//Review>

<time>1408684364384</time><rating>5</rating><text>I used ExtraSpace Storage a few years ago while stationed in St. Louis and was happy to see one nearby to accomodate my storage needs. Made my reservation online and within 10 mins, Ms. Jacob (Storage Manager) touched base with me to confirm the reservation and answer any questions I had. I moved in one day earlier than expected, and the staff (Andrew and Ms. Jacob) went above and beyond to get me squared away. Andrew took me on a tour of the facility, made sure the unit I wanted was spacious enough for my household goods, showed me how to access the unit outside of office hours via the gate code, and filed all of my leasing paperwork in a timely manner. Great service so far and so glad I decided to stick with Extra Space Storage :)</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

It's ironic that they call this company Extra Space Storage because I highly recommend their services because they take the extra step. Dana Elce, the manager, not only worked with me, but before I even signed on she asked me for any memberships that I might belong that would qualify me for a discount. We found a AAA coupon I could use. She took care of all of my storage needs in the shortest possible time. She answered all my questions without trying to sell me anything else. Given that this was a stressful last minute decision for me, she made it less stressful.   Her co-worker, Alicia Tejada is cut from the same cloth. On numerous occasions she's helped me. If you're in the southbay or nearby, and you need some extra service... please consider my new friends at Extra Space Storage.
Sincerely,  D. Mora< /Text>

My first time dinning here and the service was great. Everyone was incredibly friendly and super nice. We felt welcomed the moment we sat down. Their chips and salsa tasted so good and their shrimp tacos were to die for. So much flavor and taste. My favorite was their granada margaritas. They were well made and served in a good portion. I really enjoyed my experience dinning here. I would definitely come back.< /Review>

Little expensive but tasty.  Props for having a table salsa that is actually spicy (gotta request for the salsa).  Also great service.  Pork a little dry but garlic rice was denk.< /text>

Don Cuco's Burbank DoorDash Delivery was quick and friendly. Expensive, but I have to eat the steak protein and we're still in the pandemic. And I'm really upset, my charbroiled beef with guacamole tacos didn't come with the avocado dip. Tasty like lime and cilantro. I appreciate the complimentary salsa and nachos. The diet soda was fountain versus bottled.</Text>

Omg today service was really really bad, those girls at the reception made us go to other place.
Do not know how food there, did not get a chance to try.
Maybe you will get lucky with service there, good luck.<//review>

This place is TOP NOTCH! They have warmers on the patio for comfort, the food is amazing, the service is excellent, they always greet you with a smile, the portions are more than enough and the prices are spot on. Brought my parents for the first time tonight and now they're hooked too! Keep up the hard work Don Cuco's staff!< /Text>

<Text>Was around Toluca Lake for work and was craving some Authentic Mexican Food so I decided to check this place out!

Can't really say anything negative about the place other than not being able to dine inside

Definitely checking them out after this Covid Situation< /Text><userid>110253704084455760728</userid>< Time>

<response>None</response><Review>I was a little underwhelmed with my fajitas. Found the grilled meats (all of them - steak, chicken, shrimp) on the bland side. But my husband loved the steak burrito and my kids ate happily too. Portions were very large. Drinks were good and kid options were reasonable. The service was impeccable (kinda "old-school" service) and the place was a crowded, clearly a local favorite.< /Review><Name>Wendell Larkin</Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>110658865735534092111< /userid>< gmap_id>

<text>I just love Don Cuco's. It was my favorite restaurant when I lived in LA and my favorite when I return. The food is excellent, the Margarita's strong, and the service always exemplary. To me, it is Don Cuco's or Olvera St. if you want good Mexican food.</text><rate>5</rate></record>

<rate>5< /rate><text>As we sat outside and ate at a restaurant for the first time in what seemed years,  Don Cuco made this a pleasant experience.

The greeters and waiters made sure to cater to all customers quickly and attentively. The food came out steaming hot. The frozen Cadillac margaritas I ordered possessed a good amount of liquor. Lastly, they made sure our drinks were topped off.

The Surf and Turf burrito is a must here. The black beans and chicken soup made this a favorite of mines.

The Quesadilla Santa Fe was great, but the only problem I had with is would be attributed to the dryness on the fringes. It needed a little help with some salsa on the ends and needs a little more cheese to help keep it together.

If you're in the area and they have room on the patio, check them out!< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
A local friend took me in and I loved it. The margaritas are really good and not overly sweet, we had house strawberry and regular on the rocks. The strawberry had actual strawberry blended in it which was a nice surprise (frozen marg). The service was a bit slow but I understand with covid going on. The food was flavorful and tasted fresh and hot, there's free chips and salsa(a bit spicy but I'm not a fan of spicy). Prices, especially for drinks, are very reasonable. We had the guac and it was a just ok, lacking a bit of salt and lime in my opinion so jd skip it. Overall if you're looking for good Mexican outside of Central LA this is a great place to try.<//Review>

I love Don Cuco's! They have a few location but the menu is the same which is a blessing. They are so welcoming and their service is always perfect! I've never had a bad experience and the kitchen is might fast!! Also the margaritas are brilliant! I've tried strawberry and peach amongst the original.<//Text>

Great find. Suggested by the hotel staff. Cadillac Margaritas were PHENOMENAL!!!!

The food is great as well and worth the wait.

Ordered an enchilada plate for lunch. Price was $13 with tax for one enchilada. I thought they came in pairs. I thought this was a little much for one chicken enchilada. Beans were a little bland. Nothing special about the rice. Salsa for the chips was good. This meal should cost under $10 with tax for two chicken enchiladas. Or atleast give me two enchiladas for $13 geeez ! Customer service was good. Street parking only which can be a little hectic during lunch hours. Not sure if I'll go back for lunch again at these prices.< /Text>

<Review>Very fun Mexican restaurant!  Come for the atmosphere, location, and drinks but not the food. The food is above average but not the best.  I would categorize it as greasy Mexican food vs light Mexican food.  They do have a large menu, so if you are looking to eat healthy, you can definitely find something.  I still give this place five starts because the service has always been great.  We have a work Thanksgiving party at the Riverside location that gets bigger and bigger every year.  The restaurant is always happy to have us, is very accommodating, our food always comes in a timely manner, and the drinks are always on point.  I’m not a big margarita drinker, but my co-workers have always complemented the Cadillac Margarita.    This location is always busy but never crowded enough that it prevents me from recommending to others or having meetups.  The clientele is very chill, mostly being frequented by the surrounded businesses and studio employees.  The bar is somewhat narrow so if you plan on eating, think about getting a table or booth to give yourself a little more space.  Great restaurant filled with lots of great memories! 👍<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Food wise not so good from what I ordered

I ordered a Togo VEGGIE burrito and to be completely honest wasn’t very good. The sauce they put on top will like mildly warm and they use white rice versus Mexican or brown rice. Very odd combo and their green sauce is warm. Actually warmer than the sauce that is all over the burrito. And yes normally It’s expected when you order to go but the thing is is I was waiting for my food before they even brought the two go bag so my food should be smoking hot. Kinda a waste of $10 but now I know</Text><Rate>3</Rate><response>None</response><time>1583790305412< /time><UserId.>112583460204518422330</UserId.>< user_name>

<text>Ordered an enchilada plate for lunch. Price was $13 with tax for one enchilada. I thought they came in pairs. I thought this was a little much for one chicken enchilada. Beans were a little bland. Nothing special about the rice. Salsa for the chips was good. This meal should cost under $10 with tax for two chicken enchiladas. Or atleast give me two enchiladas for $13 geeez ! Customer service was good. Street parking only which can be a little hectic during lunch hours. Not sure if I'll go back for lunch again at these prices.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCqWlwOpxPc8GpddBbJui-hE46JHome7MExXXE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Very fun Mexican restaurant!  Come for the atmosphere, location, and drinks but not the food. The food is above average but not the best.  I would categorize it as greasy Mexican food vs light Mexican food.  They do have a large menu, so if you are looking to eat healthy, you can definitely find something.  I still give this place five starts because the service has always been great.  We have a work Thanksgiving party at the Riverside location that gets bigger and bigger every year.  The restaurant is always happy to have us, is very accommodating, our food always comes in a timely manner, and the drinks are always on point.  I’m not a big margarita drinker, but my co-workers have always complemented the Cadillac Margarita.    This location is always busy but never crowded enough that it prevents me from recommending to others or having meetups.  The clientele is very chill, mostly being frequented by the surrounded businesses and studio employees.  The bar is somewhat narrow so if you plan on eating, think about getting a table or booth to give yourself a little more space.  Great restaurant filled with lots of great memories! 👍< /Review>

Nice place for a lazy afternoon or sporting event. Good Mexican food and margaritas.

Really tasty salsa and get the Baja roll you'll love it!

Plan ahead it's always busy, but worth the wait.</Review>

My favorite spot for Mexican Food!!! Best staff around, and amazing food!

Always order the full meal... you’ll get rice & beans + soup or salad (the chicken tortilla soup is a personal favorite). Also, nothing beats their Cadillac Margaritas!< /Review>

Quaint little patio outside is nice to soak in the city life. Excellent Cadillac margaritas. Fresh homemade authentic style Mexican food. Generous portions with reasonable prices. Complimentary chips and salsa with free refills. There's something for everyone on the menu. Very friendly staff. Cozy bar with a great selection of drinks. Half moon style indoor seating that always has a lively and upbeat atmosphere. It feels like you are on vacation. A must visit restaurant whether your passing thru town or if you work nearby or a local. Clients and friends always love it. Salute!!< /Text>

Always love coming here. Sitting at the bar and chatting with the friendly bartenders and although I'm not a huge mezcal fan, they make THE BEST gin & tonics.Favorite to eat are the tinga de pollo and the carnitas tacos. Definitely want to order the chips and guac and don't forget to ask for the salsas too.<//text>

My husband and I are from Arizona, so we know what good Mexican food is. We don't take it lightly when we say this is some of the best Mexican food we have ever had! Service was outstanding! We sat on the patio and the environment was wonderful. The food was incredible, 10/10 recommend!</Text>

Oh Lord, does this place have good food and good margaritas.  The owners of this location, as well as the one on Palm Ave, just know how to make every meal perfectly.  I have had some of the best times of my life enjoying the company of friends at this restaurant.  If you haven't...you must!</review>

<Review>The place has a nice outside seating area. inside is big but very dark and the booths and tables are too close to each other. The food is good plenty of chips and salsa. the tortillas are made in house. The service is fast but maybe too fast. Waiters are a little pushy. The prices are almost double the  price of most Mexican restaurants, but is compensated with quality.  It is a very popular place and most likely the clientele is high end with a few celebrities popping in since is right in the middle of all these movie studios.<//Review>< Pictures>

The inside dinning area was larger than I expected. Lively bar area. Comfortable booths in back dinning area. Lots of menu choices. Chips and salsa were tasty, $5 small side guacamole well worth it. Great food, lobster enchiladas won the day.</text>

Ugh, I liked the waiter who was funny. But the tortilla soup was tiny, all chunks of potatoes, hardly any broth, or anything else. Taste was poor. Fajitas arrived burned. Never had that messed up anywhere else.So essentially no dinner.  Chips and salsa good. Crowded noisy, tables small, booth seats too close to table. Just uncomfortable. Didn't have drinks but everyone else seemed to like them. Maybe that's the only way to tolerate the food.</Text>

I had the mole enchiladas combination plate. It was acceptable but not exactly good, the mole sauce split and separated almost immediately. The chicken inside the enchiladas was well cooked, but the refried beans and rice were bland. The prices reflect the tuxedo shirt and bowtie clad servers, rather than the food quality.<//Text>

<review>This is the second time the center of my enchiladas were undercooked and cold. And, they hover and interrupt constantly to turn the tables. Plus, the prices are just ridiculous. Sadly, it's a trendy spot that doesn't live up to the hype.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Why this has two dollar signs is beyond me. One kids’ lunch (cheeseburger, beans, rice) and a taco platter (with ONE taco, rice, beans, and a salad) cost $26. Yeah, you read that right. Twenty. six. dollars. Also it’s so dark in here it’s been such a romantic lunch with my toddler. 🙄Seriously you can barely see the food you’re eating and I don’t know why they think candlelight improves the ambience, especially when they use paper napkins. Good luck parking here, too. It’s the only reason we didn’t leave. It took so much driving around to get a spot, I just couldn’t give up the space once we got one.< /review>

This is a staple in our "cheat day" rolodex (do people even still know what that is?).

They have some of the best chips and salsa  in Los Angeles. They are just so fresh and perfect.

All their food is quite good. I've tried many things and I've never been unhappy. They seem to get lots of fajita orders, they are definitely quite good here.

I recommend any of their burritos, fajitas, molé enchiladas, and most any appetizers.</Text>

<text>Waited for 25 minutes to be sat, watched a family of 5 leave and only pay for there drinks because everyone around them who got there after them were already eating and they hadn’t even gotten there order taken. Then the ladies at the front desk called the wrong person  and then tried to call the right party up but ended up sitting the miscalled party and the other people had to wait again. I Still sat waiting, until a party of 7 got sat before us and arrived 10 minutes after us. Horrible experience all around, very VERY small in there, it smelt amazing to bad I didn’t get a fair shot at trying it out. Good luck to the rest of you.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>I stopped by after Forrest Lawn since my boys were hungry. I gave it a four star since it doesn’t have Horchata, Tamarindo and other drinks as it should for a Mexican restaurant. Also, the lack of parking is painful to be honest.

The food was great and with a decent portion as it should since price is pretty high compared to other Mexican restaurants. The waiter always checked on us to make sure we had everything or if needed anything else.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8IJtqb0fKPfRJ9_Vz1_GKabcTz_7nzZmkJfU7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bfcc44a2e821:0x62ec9c1e19e612ff< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Cozy atmosphere, good service, be forewarned that the food portions are large. I absolutely loved their salsa and the very thin, crisp chips. And if you like black beans, like me, you'll enjoy the way they are prepared here.< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><username>Mark Neill<//username><Review>Last night's estimated 30 minute wait to be seated actually took an hour. It then took another 45 minutes to get our food - which was cold.  I don't mean lukewarm, but my enchilada cold, which makes me wonder how freshly prepared the food actually is. Waitress didn't seem surprised or apologetic while offering to "re-heat it".  I seriously don't understand how this was the recommended place for Mexican food. Perhaps I was unlucky but there was so much wrong with our visit.

My experience was average Mexican food in a loud and very dark booth, at premium prices and painfully slow service.</Review>< gmap_id>

Recommend sitting middle bar or closer to the street as the far end of the bar is right next to the men's restroom and the smell of urinal cakes is pungent every time someone uses the toilet.

Great chips and salsa. We used to get salsa and sour cream for a decadent dip.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Don Cuco's Riverside Dr. is fantastic. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. They've got good Margaritas from what I've heard but I prefer Tequila Sunrise. They have wonderful cozy ambiance. Outside seating is nice. The food is excellent on all levels. I've never been disappointed. I real winners are the deep fried ice cream and hot apple chimichanga a la mode.</review>

<Text>One of the best places for lunch or dinner near the studios, on Riverside just off the 134 Freeway at Pass Ave.  It's been one of my favorite Mexican restaurants since first eating there over 15 years ago. And the food has only gotten better. Great place for bday celebrations!  Known for their special homemade margaritas in a schooner. Can't go wrong!<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2bfcc44a2e821:0x62ec9c1e19e612ff<//gmapID>< Time>

I have never been a big fan of Mexican food but absolutely LOVE the food here. It's the only place I'll eat it. Their salsa is amazing. I like the atmosphere as well. Great spot to get together with friends.</Review>

<Text>This location of Don Cuco’s Mexican Restaurant has been here since 1969!  The ambiance is fantastic and worth the visit! My friend and I ate at the bar, but I’d love to eat in the booths in the restaurant someday.  The food was good but pricey for what it was. It was good. Not find blowing. But $19 for a burrito is a bit on that line. If it was $13 or $14, I’d probably have given this a 5. Wish they had beer on tap. They may, but I was given a bottle. Anyways, this is DEFINITELY worth the visit to experience it.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Came here twice. Not sure why I came the second time. Bad memory? Doubting it could have been that bad? Shame on me.

The food is overpriced and awful. How a Mexican restaurant in LA can get away with that quality is beyond me. Soggy, bland, unappetizing. The rice and beans are disappointing, and those are the cornerstone of any Mexican meal.

On top of that, the serving and hosting staff are all rude.

Hopefully learning this lesson twice is enough for me.<//review>

I have been eating at Don Cuco's for more than 40 years, and incredibly, there are wait-staff that have been working there for at least that long.  No matter how much time lapses between my visits, these long-time waiters always recognize me when I return. Their Chili Con Queso and Frijoles de la Olla are two excellent dishes that are unique to this restaurant, and ones that I have not found anywhere else.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2bfcc44a2e821:0x62ec9c1e19e612ff< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love Mexican food and this place is pretty great! Kinda El Torito style but more vibrant and I feel like the food has more spices and flavor to it. They have a small patio in the front, but it is the perfect place to meet a friend for dinner or a drink. It's pretty crowded around lunchtime with all the businesses nearby.</text><pics>None< /pics><Rate>4< /Rate>< date>

The atmosphere was great, the service was great. Free Chips & Salsa can't go wrong with that. Now let's dive in; ever since I've been watching nightmares kitchen I critique restaurants differently. The salsa tasted it like it came from a can which is probably why it's free. The margarita was $10 however it had artificial flavoring and it wasn't craft. The margarita is definitely not worth the price which turned me off. The only time I would go back to this restaurant is if it's on somebody else's dime, so then I don't feel bad for having mediocre salsa and drinks. If you're looking for a place that serves great food and great drinks this is not your place but if you're looking for a place to Hangout and not really concerned with the drinks or food check this spot out.< /text>

When I went, even as they were very busy, we had excellent service from everyone from the valet, to the beautiful hostesses, to the kind and friendly wait staff -- and the food was delicious, especially the corn tortillas. Very happy with my experience here!</text>

A small but cozy neighborhood gem! Solid Mexican food, great service and awesome margaritas on the rocks! :) The only downer is there can be a wait at specific usual times but definitely a go to when in the Mexican mood! Enjoy!< /Review>

< review>
The service has always been great here. The food is not tasty at all!!! I've been here many times before because it used to be a go to from where I worked with other employees but I was never happy with the flavor of the food. I'm pretty sure most of the reviews are just excited because it's a hot spot of activity. I just can't justify the taste of the food.< /review>

Terrible! I know I'm going against the grain of the other reviews here, but we waited a half hour to be seated when we were told 15 minutes, they screwed up our drink order, my mother is still waiting for her iced tea as we speak, even though we asked for it twice. Maybe it's because it's like trying to order inside of an Amphitheater while a concert is going on, super loud, our waitress had to lean in just to take our order. Onto the food, the guacamole was bland, the salsa tasted like it came from a bottle, we waited 35 minutes for our dinner, and when it was brought to us they served my daughter and I the wrong plates, she got mine and I got hers. All that before I even tasted the main course, I ordered the Chipotle steak burrito, it was terrible! It tasted like rehydrated beef jerky with beans. I waited 35 minutes for my dinner and ate about three bites and that was enough for me. A lot of people I know say this is the place to go for Mexican food, and at my brothers recommendation I went there tonight, maybe it was an off night, maybe it was too busy and the service and the food suffered, but I will never go back again to find out.</review>

Good, standard Mexican food, well-made, generous margueritas, and really excellent, attentive service. It's not cutting edge fancy-mex, but, when you want good, standard Mexican in the Burbank area, in a pleasant, buzzing, low-light atmosphere, it's a good choice. Prices, moderate, in the 20's for an entre, which comes with soup or salad. The albondogas cup was tasty, but just one meatball. The combo plates are generous, you are unlikely to leave hungry.< /review>

Service was great, and our waitress took good care of us, but food quality falls a bit short for my standards and prices are high in relation to serving size.

I ordered the fajitas combo and it only had a small portion of meat (including only two pieces of shrimp), and a mountain of onions. The food is under seasoned, and pretty sub par to standard in overall quality.

My only other qualm is that the restaurant is very dimly lit, so it can cause a little eye strain.</review>

< Review>
I hadn't been to Don Cuco's since I moved to Orange County in the late 80's. It's one of the only original places still doing business right there, so you KNOW it's gotta be good! The place is decorated beautifully inside, and has a tiny outdoor patio for dining too. It's spotlessly clean, the wait staff is on the ball, extremely attentive and the drinks & food... FANTASTIC! Their salsa is to die for! If you're on your lunch hour, you'll be in and out with time to spare, and totally satisfied! Highly recommend for anyone in, around or passing through the Toluca Lake/Burbank/North Hollywood area. Bravo Don Cuco!<//Review>

<Review>We were looking for a home-made taste while on our way to an event at WB and this place did not disappoint! The staff was great and Ferdinin super attentive. Not as dark as other similar places but it also didn’t feel stuffy. LOVED the food! I tend to judge a Mexican restaurant by their chiles rellenos (they are my personal specialty) and even though they don’t use the pasilla peppers I prefer, they were so fresh and well done! Delicious! Pricey compared to similar restaurants, but the portions are huge and the overall dining experience wonderful. Can’t wait to come back!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I was craving tamales so bad and this was the first place I found that was nearest to me. What a disappointment it was. Their tamales were disgusting. It was worse than frozen fast food.</Review>

<Review>Ordered only beans with no topping but cheese and they brought it with rice and green onions. The waitress seemed like she was annoyed with a lot of things. Then they pretty much rushed us out.< /Review>< gmapID>

I grew up in Burbank so this place was a staple growing up. I have since moved away, but do try to go anytime I am back in town. This past Sunday I did just that! There are many Don Cuco's around the southland, but this one is the original. Although I have not been to each location, I have been to many of them. I believe this one is the best for atmosphere, stargazing (its close to the studios so you never know who you may run in to) and food quality. I also think their margarita's are better at this location. The service is good and the servers are super nice. I normally just get a bean and cheese burrito, but today I got the El Taco Grande with Albondigas soup. It kinda reminded me of the Taco Light from Taco Bell years ago, but much better! The soup was very good! My husband got the Lobster Enchiladas. He didn't LOVE them, but he did like them. He believes it was probably more Langostino meat than Lobster meat. He didn't ask to confirm so he could be wrong. Nevertheless, he did enjoy them for the most part. The prices are decent, although I think this location is higher priced then the one in Newhall, Ca. I also believe the menu to be a little different.< /Text>

Everyone likes don cucos. I like don cucos. I wouldn't RAVE about it, but it's a fun atmosphere, chips on the table, and large menu, which for a Mexican place is tough! Definitely worth checking out.<//review>

Everyone likes don cucos. I like don cucos. I wouldn't RAVE about it, but it's a fun atmosphere, chips on the table, and large menu, which for a Mexican place is tough! Definitely worth checking out.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Great evening spent in this restaurant, dishes are served in very large quantities! Beware! Or be ready to take a doggy bag! Very good value for money ! (Can be a flat on the price of margaritas ... $ 10)
But otherwise nothing to complain! Service very good!

(Original)
Super soirée passée dans ce restau, les plats sont servis en très grosse quantité !! Méfiez vous ! Ou soyez prêts à prendre un doggy bag ! Très bon rapport qualité prix ! (Peut être un bémol sur le prix des margaritas...10$)
Mais sinon rien à redire ! Service très bien !</Review>
