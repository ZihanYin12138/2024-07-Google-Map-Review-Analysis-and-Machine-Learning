<Review>For the past 3 years we’ve been taking our kids here and they don’t disappoint. Everyone in the salon has been very friendly and welcoming, They’re professional and definitely have the patience with children of all ages. I really appreciate Tania for making my daughter feel beautiful and helping boost her confidence.</Review><gmap_id>0x809442f2cdc9ddbd:0xb1be7f2fc59e2f70<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

First time here and was absolutely wonderful 😊. As soon as you enter the girl in the front makes you feel comfortable, she's friendly and polite. Tanya (who cut my son's hair)was very patient, she was very kind and tried to comfort my son while she was working on him, and the haircut was great!! I will definitely be coming back.<//review>

Took my 1 year old in for a hair cut. Tania was so awesome!! She did a fantastic job, and even sang baby shark during the haircut. They are super law enforcement friendly. Which I really appreciated. Thank you!</Text>

Second time coming here. The first time was jam packed with little one's.  Today similar, I think all the staff is wonderful. Tanya in my opinion stood out both times. So calm and collected. She noticed both of my boys are special needs and was even more understanding and sweet. She said something in response to our conversation,  "just pray about it, it'll be the Lords will". I knew something was different.  You just don't find people like her everywhere. The Lord bless her! If you have employee of the month..she deserves it.<//review>

It was second time taking my son there. First time was a okay experience. However the second time was  bad. My sons hair was so patchy and uneven. The lady cutting his hair seemed very nervous.< /review>

Took my baby for his first haircut at the age of 1. He did great and so did they! Very clean place and are great with children. I continued taking him there and Tania is great!! She cut my boys hair exactly how I wanted it. I didnt mind driving all the way from Herndon and polk to take my boy here! Very cute place and very professional.< /review>

< Review>
My little son used to cry and cry every time I took him for a haircut, so I did some research online and found this place. Now it is the only place he will go. He actually looks forward to going, because they give you such individual attention and they give you a sticker and a lollipop and it is a great experience for kids. If your child needs a haircut, GO TO CORKY’S. They even have a play area for while the kids wait. Loyal customer, we go every 6 weeks now, and always look forward to it.< /Review>

<Text>I am giving this buisness 2 stars because they were friendly and the place is nice and clean. I took both of my kids for haircuts and paid almost $40 dollars. My daughter got a trim and the girl who cut her hair carefully cut her hair the way I wanted. My son's hair on the other hand is very bad, it is completely uneven in the front, his side burns look choppy and also slanted. I had asked to keep his length on top the way it was and the front part of the top of his head is completely shorter than the rest top part of his hair. he has some hairs longer than others. She had gelled his hair down and I hadn't noticed until after we got home and bathed him. I am very disappointed, as I drove almost an hour to go to this place because it was so kid friendly.<//Text><rating>2<//rating>< pictures>

< Review>
Love this place! My husband and I take my son here for haircuts. Our first time here Anjanette cut his hair and we loved her! She took about 5 minutes and did it perfectly, She didn’t even give him time to get fussy. Unfortunately she doesn't work there anymore (from what I know). Now we only get my sons haircuts with Ceci & she’s great with him, if she’s not there we go with Cassandra. We have only had one bad experience here and that was with Mariah, I believe it was when she just started working there. She left my sons hair really choppy and she went super short that we couldn’t fix it without making him bald. Although we didn’t like the haircut she was super nice and she recognized that she didn’t do a great job and told us to go back and ask for someone else to fix it.  Since then we are scared to go with anyone but Ceci and Cassandra, but as long as they’re there we are 😃</Review>

<review>Great place to go for the kiddos. The business is clean and the employees (when I am there at the least) are professional! The only reason I give a four is everyone is human and mistakes are sometimes made. However, I continue to return each haircut needed for my kids because I am happy with the overall outcome. I will clarify the only mistakes I have ever received are tiny patches missed and this does not discourage me!!< /review>< response>

<Review>I took my kids (ages 1 & 3) here for their first hair cuts.  The lady that cut their hair was so gentle and patient with them.  Both kiddos enjoyed the experience and was thrilled to get a token to ride the  moving car after their hair cut.  I would definitely recommend this place for all kids, but especially those who may feel anxious about getting a hair cut.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Went to Corkys after reading the reviews and I was not disappointed. We got my daughters haircut their as well as my nieces first haircut. We were walk ins and were taken care of right away. The stylist made sure the haircuts were what we wanted and asked questions to make sure. Everyone was very friendly and great with our 5 year olds. The girls even added some glitter to both kids hair with their styling which the 5 year olds loved. We will be returning . The decor is awesome as well!</review>

I took my 1 1/2 yr old grandson  for a haircut. He's had 3 other haircuts at other places and he's very difficult to cut because he doesn't like it. So I decided to pay more (20$) for his cut at a place where it's focus is on kids and I was sooo pleased with the outcome. My stylist was Amber.... She was brave enough to cut my grandson hair (bless her heart) and she did wonderful. She's quick and did a great job cutting his hair on a kid that's crying, fighting, moving all around. I'm sooo glad I went here. I recommend this place to all parents with little one difficult to cut. Thank you Amber and all the staff. Pleasant environment and I will return again.</review>

I called ahead to make an appt. and be sure the stylist could "handle" her hair lol. I was assured they could. When we got here we were taken right back. My daughter was given a choice in chairs. A movie was put on for her to watch (the small details matter). The stylist did do a good job on her hair. My daughter and I were both happy!

I see you’ve taken the time to write the same review on yelp and google however, you won’t respond back to me . Like I told you on yelp, my stylists have been with me for a long time and like anything g else people move on in different career paths. My one stylist had been with me almost 7 years and left to go into teaching. I have one stylist that has been with me 2 1/2 years, another one 2 years, another one for a year and a half. I keep hiring because we are so busy. If you’ve come in numerous times then you would know the stylists that have been here for a long time. Also I’m assuming your cuts were good before since you have been coming numerous times. This is your first complaint that I’m aware of.\nThe best way to train new stylists is to show them a haircut that wasn’t done correctly. So if you would like to send me pictures of the cut I will use it as training. But until you provide your child’s name and when you came in, I can’t help you. I feel that if people take so much time to write a review they would like to get it taken care of, so unless I hear from you I have no way to confirm your review and that you actually came to our shop. We strive for perfection however as you know, no stylist or salon is 100 percent perfect. Would love to hear from you.\nDena'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Love coming here, they are so patient with my son and they make his hair look so cute. I really wish they would expand their business out to west Fresno. I live on Marks and Bullard so it's not an easy drive. My son is so tired of being in the car by the time we get there that he's all fussy and cranky during his session.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>savvs94 star</Name><review>We're greatful for finding corkys! Kid friendly, and they work very well with children with special needs. After their cut, they are given a token to ride a cop car. Different chairs are available for the children to sit. You can book am appointment, or do a walk in. The longest we've had to wait when we did a walk in was 10 minutes. The location is a little far from us, but the trips are worth it.</review>< date>

Im glad most people had a good experience here. It sounds like we might of went their the wrong time of the month. I almost got ran over in the parking lot. And the girl driving turned out to be a one of the hair stylist. She didnt even say sry. Then the girl that cut my son's hair had a really bad attitude. Didnt smile or even try to have a conversation with us. We would try to talk with her and she wouldn't respond to us. Wouldnt even help us pick out a hair cut. Was really snobby when we asked what she would do. And didnt even help us pick out a hair cut. Then she would make noises ( like you would with a puppy dog ) to get my son to look a certain way. It worked but kinda made me a little angry. Then when she was done we tryed to get a pick of are son in the monster truck seat he was in and it wasnt working out. And the look on the girls face was like hurry the hell up. Then she asked us to pic him up and put him in the little cop car thing they have so she could take a pic. So we put him in their and she turnd the thing on and about made him fall out from the thing moving so fast. Granted he had just turned 1 years old. So im very happy that others and thier children had a good experience with them. Wish i could say the same. I will not be going their again. We live out around kerman and had heard very good things about this place. So we made the drive. And on the way home we wished we would of did something else.</Text>

< Review>
The first time I took my son here the hair stylist did a great job...especially since she was working around my 1 year old son sleeping. I felt the hair stylist knew what I wanted after showing her pictures. The stylist was also older and said she had been cutting kids haor for many years (which made me feel reassured) well I recently took my son back and his haircut is terrible. I literally want to shave the rest of his hair off. The stylist this time looked very young. I showed the stylist pictures and she didnt really care to look. I felt she was working very fast like trying to get the haircut over as quickly as she could. Anyways, moral of the story is my son's haircut is so uneven. Wish I would've spoken up and not paid...thats how horrible it is!!!!!</Review>

Cuts are a little on the expensive side, but the distractions for the kids are very useful. My kids were never afraid to go to the salon because we started them at places like Corkys.<//Review>

Another worker came in went straight to the back came back out and called my daughter, I  didn't even get a name.. Now since we got home look at my daughter and I can so done it myself or gone somewhere else for so much cheaper than what I paid for here, the sides are just cut straight and just shorten her bangs, and a buzz on the back. I'm pretty sure on the board it says first time gets a photo, certificate, lock of their hair,( which my daughter didn't have ). Im pretty sure I didn't get any of the other 2,  didn't even get a bye have a nice day, I had to say bye first and for me to say thank you first.. Come on now I don't know what kind of service this is providing but for sure im not going back wouldn't recommend anyone to go...< /review>< name>

Ruined his first haircut. I never leave reviews,you have to be super terrible for me to leave a bad one. *****Update i will not remove my review this is the place I went to on FOWLER AND NEES. On SETEMBER 15 or 16 went in for a haircut and like I said nothing for what we asked for and customer service was TERRIBLE!

<Review>My go - to but,  lately the  Schedule is never consistent. Don't even get greeted just walk in awkwardly (only greets friends) Not the place to get Fades lineups, or scissor cuts (always come home with a un-even fade) Eddie slowly stopped giving a f*ck and that's why unfortunately,  I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Higher up prices and get new, trained, talented staff that know what they're doing and it'll be a different story.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

I came to this place when it was OPEN. Or at least that’s what the hours posted in big text on the front of their store, but they’re closed. Probably not coming back here again.<//review>

Sign in as soon as you get there so theres no guessing who came in first! All the barbers here are really nice, lots of deco, a tv, lots of pictures of haircuts so there's no excuse for you to complain about it. They're good at fades and tapers and the alike. Very cheap prices and because of all that... I happily tip!</Text>

<Text>I liked the hair cut until I noticed she had trimmed a line into my sideburns make a division between my beard and hair. That makes no sense and is really stupid. Both sides are the same stupid line.<//Text>< user>

I went to get a haircut here as I usually do every few months after moving out to Pomona and this time was so awful!
This is the first time I went when Eddie wasn't there and it feels like the two girls working closest to the bathroom were taking advantage of that. I asked Evelyn to just clean up my hair and she ended up making it look way worse than it was before. I'm in the process of growing out my hair so once in a while, I need it to be cleaned up. Now my hair looks choppy and goofy as hell and now it's just a matter of growing it out.

On top of that, she would often stop cutting my hair for minutes at a time to chat/gossip with her coworker AND she over charged me. Eddie always tells her to charge me a certain amount and this time that he wasn't there she charged me more.
Whenever people ask me where I get my haircut because they like it so much I tell them I got it from here but looking at how stupid my hair looks now, it would be embarrassing for this shop for people to know my hair was cut here.

Overall, I only recommend this place if the owner Eddie is there because then the workers are more inclined to do their work correctly.<//Review>

Daniel was thorough in explaining all the details that led up to my son’s lesson. On the day of the lesson we met with Edgar. He was patient and great with my son. Since COVID my son lost interest in just about everything. This was a surprise and changed his outlook completely. He left feeling full of life again!!! Thank you again Daniel and Edgar for such a memorable day.

Riley is 14, and this was his first time on a bike, and understandably, a bit nervous. Daniel made sure Riley felt successful by setting small realistic goals all while treating him with kindness and respect. Keeping safety in the forefront, Daniel made sure Riley understood the bike basics and safety gear. The whole family enjoyed seeing this kid have fun, and we're glad to have had Daniel as his teacher! We'll absolutely hire Sedlak offroad school again. If he can make a beginner feel like a winner,  I'm sure any kid/young adult would love to hang with Daniel for a day in the dirt!  Bring chocolate chip cookies and you'll be his favorite! ;)< /text>

< Review>
After years of riding myself, my son has taken up this activity with me so I booked this lesson I thought more for him. I was amazed at how much I learned and it has completely changed my skill and confidence level. I watched my son gain the control and respect I was hoping for. Edgar was simply amazing and an outstanding instructor as well as a super likable young man. Great experience and I recommend it to everyone….< /Review>

Awesome experience! I am relatively new to the sport and pretty much self taught up until today. My ability went up ten fold in just one day with Daniel and Edgar. Can’t wait to hit the trails to apply everything they taught me! I highly recommend Sedlak Offroad School to anyone looking to step up their game. Novice to advanced, these guys will definitely help. Worth every penny!</text>

< Review>
Friendly, knowledgeable and very good people. I liked both Daniel and Edgar immediately.
Advice was on-point and individual, for every rider. I felt better and more confident incorporating their advice, but kept falling back into my bad habits. Change is hard.
Guys were encouraging and positive, always. I’m a better rider now</Review>

I'm new to adventure motorcycles.  I bought a T700 about six months ago.  I've been riding it as much as I can, but still haven't quite gotten comfortable riding in dirt.  I signed up for a 3 hour class with Daniel which I completed a few days ago.  The class was excellent!  Daniel started with the basics of foot/peg and leg position.  During drills he stopped me often and gave me feedback which I greatly appreciated.  We then moved into body and arm position and continued to practice.  Daniel made some adjustments on my handlebar positioning that help me better position my arms and body on the motorcycle while standing up.  Toward the end of the class we worked on rear braking / sliding which was a lot of fun and confidence building.  Finally, we went on a single track.  Despite being a lot more difficult, I felt very confident riding the trail! Daniel did a super job and I expect to be returning soon for another session<//review>

It was their first time riding a motorcycle and by the end of the day they felt incredibly comfortable around the terrain we even made a couple of small jumps. Edgar was amazing and I 100% recommend trying it out. Extremely professional company.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Best experience ever! My wife, 2 sons (14 and 12), and I never have ridden a dirt bike ever. We learned a lot in a 4-hour span, and had fun learning how to ride! Daniel is a great instructor, and very helpful and patient with us first-timers. I highly recommend Sedlak Off-road for those who want to learn how to ride dirt bikes 🙂<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Throttle therapy at it's finest! This is the most fun I've ever had on a motorcycle! As a first timer to riding a dirt bike I had an informative and memorable experience with Edgar who recognized my abilities and took me on paths for an absolute epic time. Do it!<//review>

< Review>
We had a stellar experience with Sedlak.  First time riding with my preteen kid.  Daniel(owner) is communicative, punctual, and helped us have a great day.  My bike was essentially new and fitted to my size.  The other clothing gear and equipment provided was clean and of good quality.  Safety was stressed throughout the day.  My kid had a blast with his own instructor, freeing me to enjoy myself and focus on riding.  Cannot wait to go back with my wife.  Well worth the cost, hands down!</Review>

I signed up for the basic Adventure Motorcycle class along with a couple of buddies. Although I’ve ridden road bikes for many years, and 3+ years on over-500-pounds adventure bikes, I found this off-road training to be extremely helpful. The pointers on body position, turns, brake locking, and slide control made a huge difference. Daniel style of instruction was very relaxed and his communication very effective. I’m looking forward to applying his advice, and very likely I’ll sign up for another session. I highly recommend this motorcycle school.<//review>

<Text>As a rider for only 4 years, I am self taught and have developed some bad habits. In a matter of hours, Daniel instruction gave me some techniques to help be feel more planted on my bike and in control. I've never taken tight turns so fast before, and was doing them with confidence after some practice. I'll continue to practice these techniques and will come back for more training. Recommended for new and seasoned riders alike.</Text><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>114273031353120565760</userid>< resp>

<Review>I had an amazing time !
Before this I was a first time rider and never stepped foot on a bike. I love one-on-one session because it allows you ask all the silly questions that one might be afraid to ask in a group setting, While also taloring the lesson’s to your skill set and comfort level.

The team here is not only patient, talented and loves to ride... but they also love to teach new riders.

Ill most definitely be back for future classes and lessons.<//Review>< rate>

I've been racing for 20+ years and never thought something like this could help me this much!!
With body positioning tweaks, I can ride faster, longer with more control!
Knowing how to do something well is one thing, being able to teach it is a true gift... Daniel and Edgar have this gift!!
With what I learned from them, I am now back in contention for a championship!!!
Thank you Sedlak off-road school!! 🔥💯🏁🏆<//Text>

I signed up for a day in the Dirt with Daniel with a friend and had a brilliant experience. I am a beginner rider, and Daniel made us feel extremely comfortable and helped us learn the basics with some simple exercises. Before we knew it, we were up and running and going through some off-road trails through the desert on the border of California and Mexico, with some epic views! Daniel has an exceptionally vast knowledge of riding and made us feel incredibly comfortable and in control throughout the day. I would highly recommend Seldek offroad school. A great experience, and always good to ride new bikes and be set up with proper off-road riding gear, top-notch! Will definitely be doing this again!< /Text>

Great communication and help with the details for a first timer, before, during and after the lesson. I am impressed with the way these guys go out of their way to help in every aspect - not just on the track. Our Instructor was knowledgeable. Lesson went great. We will be scheduling for another soon.< /review>

I had an awesome time with Dan and Edgar! I highly recommend giving it a go riding with them. I’d like to think of myself as a pretty proficient rider, but I knew I had some issues with leg/foot positioning. I also find myself not looking far enough ahead and remembering to breath through tough sections. They were able to pick up on these flaws right away and help me address them. They did an excellent job watching the whole group and giving individual advice/tips to help everyone out. We ran a few different loops that had their own challenges and sections to focus on. They both had a way of explaining what we were doing wrong, while also highlighting what we were doing right and increased our confidence to focus on getting better. I had a great time and I can’t wait to get back out there with them. I find it hard to get out and ride as much as I used to/want to. I found the class invaluable at getting plenty of seat time in and actually learning better technique/form. Instead of going out and spending a day re-enforcing bad habits, spend a day with them and come out a better rider! Plus, where else can you go and get personalized tips and advice from two seasoned pro’s!!! I also want to congratulate Edgar Cota on his killer win at the Baja 250 this year!!! I also wish much success to Daniel Sedlak in his auto racing career in the future!! You guys are killing it!! Until next time, keep the rubber down and thanks again!!
Highly recommend the class!!!!<//text>

I'll start this review by saying don't look anywhere else, book with Sedlak Offroad School, Daniel and his team get a 100% endorsement form me.

Sedlak Offroad School is unmatched if you want to learn how to ride an off-road bike or even how to ride a bike. Daniel and his team are awesome. You are being taught by the best, with a lifetime of competitive off-road experience Daniel takes you through a step by step process from starting out to preparing yourself for your first competition!

I honestly can't say enough good things about the experience. S.O.S. use brand new bikes, in the best condition, with top of the line apparel, helmets, goggles, gloves the works. I had never been off-road before, so I arrived somewhat nervous, but Daniel immediately put me at ease, and in the space of 4 hours, I'd gone from 100% novice to competent off-road rider. We started with a rundown of the bike I was going to be riding, then practiced starting the bike and riding off. This progressed into riding around cones to get used to the weight and how to balance the bike. When I was more comfortable with the bike, we practiced hard stops (without stalling!).

With all of this under our belts, we progressed to riding simple trails, that as the time went by progressed into more complex and challenging trails. The highlight was the last part of the session in which we followed Daniel on a ride that took us on inclines and declines, through streams, over rocky ground, loose ground, and all manner of terrain.

I finish this review by saying I'll be taking more coaching from Daniel. in the months to come.< /Text>

<Text>After riding all my life at my snail pace I was stuck in my old ways and always struggled in specific situations. Never had anybody looking at me and tell me exactly what I was doing wrong. Of course cookie cutter advice you get online or any other publications can only go so far. I did not turn into a champ overnight after just one training day, of course, but I’ve definitely improved a lot and it gets better every time I ride my KTM and pay close attention to what I’m doing, trying to execute what Daniel thought me. Eventually it will become second nature and I’ll be able to ride comfortably pretty much anywhere at a decent speed. Will definitely go back<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I have been riding motorcycles for the last 40 years. I have raced moto, road and enduro. Some of the guys I ride enduro with told me about SOS, so we all signed up. When we arrived they had everything set up. We did a quick class about body position and we were off and riding. They had 4 loops set up for us. The first loop worked on just evaluating our level of experience. Then we were split into 2 groups based on experience and we started riding. Different loops and working on skills. The group had beginner rides to racers. The coaching was based on what we needed and we all took away some great tips. I would go again to become better.

When you go bring a shade structure, food, and some cold drinks. We had 3-4 breaks and it was nice to sit around and talk and refuel.</Review>< pics>

I signed up for the Enduro class. First time in a long while riding a motorcycle so it was slow going to begin with which was what i needed. After an hour, i got into a good rhythm.

I had a great day with Daniel and learned the newest techniques for proper offroad riding. It was interesting to learn that techniques have indeed changed a lot since I learned to ride years ago. It's next level stuff that has really improved my game! Daniel's a solid teacher with strong credentials and talent for spotting the details.< /text>

FANTASTIC!!!  Took a private lesson yesterday and was very impressed.  Came away exhausted, but WAY more confident!  Can't wait to do it again.  Once I can move again that is...lol!  Do it, it's worth it!<//review>

<Review>Daniel is a thoughtful instructor with a wealth of experience.  To achieve your goals safety - before you buy anything get lessons from SOS.  Working with SOS will shorten my learning curve by years.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>If you’re trying to learn the basics, improve your intermediate skills and/or  refresh them, then Dan Sedlak’s course is a must. Dan is an experienced pro who knows what he’s talking about and doing. He’s been competing and teaching his whole life. Take his class you will be happy you did! I’ll be back for more for sure!</Text>< date>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I ran into Daniel randomly and recognized him from YouTube. I decided to take a class as I need some help with whoops (amongst other things). It was well worth it! I learned a lot and more importantly his instruction/explanations were easy for me to understand and I could tell he was hyperfocused on my riding at all times and really paying attention. He even paid attention to my bike and helped tune my suspension. Highly recommend you just go for it if you want to improve your riding. Easy scheduling and welcoming riding environment.

Update: Took another lesson, this time at the track with Edgar. Equally beneficial! I felt more in control and confident in turns and increasing my jumps. You think you're riding a certain way but it's huge to have someone actually watching what you're doing in reality. He explained a couple things to me that I've heard 100 times, from YouTube or otherwise, but he was able to explain it specifically to me and how it was affecting me specifically. It's like a light went on and everything got better. Do yourself a favor, if you're serious about improving and staying as safe as possible through a correct and proper skill set, get in touch with SOS. Thanks Daniel and Edgar!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I had the pleasure of joining Daniel Sedlak and his crew for some Enduro riding and training and I have to say I was truly impressed by the awesome and amazing teaching.  I did 5 days with SOS and learned TONS and TONS and I feel way more confident to hit the Arizona trails back home.  Daniel and his staff were incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and friendly and made us feel comfortable on the dirt bike from day 1.   I will definitely be back for more riding and learning with Sedlak Off-road School.  Thank you Daniel and Edgar! You guys are awesome!</Review>

My son and I thoroughly enjoyed spending a few days with Edgar learning how to dirt bike!  They get you right into it, you’re up and riding within minutes.  My little guy was so stoked.  There are some really cool locations also.  I was a little intimidated my first time at the track but Edgar made it chill and safe.  We are continuing to go!< /text>

I’ve been riding for only about two years and wanted some coaching to learn quicker. I goal is to be a more confident and safer rider. Edgar Cota is very talented and a natural coach. I highly recommend getting some coaching to help dial in those fundamentals or take your riding to the next level.<//review>

Exactly what you want for either learning to ride for the first time or if you need a good refresher course before hitting the dirt again. The equipment and bikes were clean and new and the personal attention and instruction was great. I was able to bring my entire family for a great day of learning and riding.</Review>

Daniel is a star!! He really took care of my kids 9 & 13 giving them the confidence to ride for the first time and teaching them to appreciate the mechanics of a dirt bike. Plenty if track time during our “Day in the Dirt” experience. Looking forward to the next session.< /text>

So my son turned 14 yrs old and really wanted to try to ride a dirt bike. I found this company and bought the 4 hour “Day in the dirt” package for him and I. We drove out to Otay and meet our instructor Edgar. This kid (I day kid cause I’m 46 lol) was amazing. He taught my son how to sit, knees etc. and got him going immediately. My son has never ridden  a clutch before but had him going in no time at all! After running some simple drills in and out of cones, we were both on a track in no time! Edgar even had a cooler of waters, chairs and a pop up tent for shade! The kid never crashed the entire time! Can’t say the same for me lol.

If you’re looking for a great time in the dirt and don’t have the equipment, this company is perfect. I rode dirt bikes growing up and Edgar even taught me some helpful tips! I can’t say enough about this company!!! I spoke to a group of my friends and we will definitely be calling and asking for Edgar to ride with us next time!!!< /Text>

Daniel and team hosted a 4-hour private for me and my two kids - ages 13 (boy) and 8 (girl).  We had little experience but felt safe and supported through the session.  Team was super patient and gave great coaching advice.  By the end, we were all racing along the trails having the time of our lives.  Highly recommended!  We’ll be back.<//Text>

My son is a shy 6 year old and he loses confidence easily, and i when i took him out on the 50 i bought him,  i didn’t have any luck getting him going.  So i thought i would try Sedlak Off-road school, and to my surprise his riding coach Edgar had him riding figure 8’s in no time!  My son didn’t want to stop riding!  Edgar was really patient with my son and motivated him to give it another try when he wanted to go home.  So stoked!< /text>

After 3 hrs, I could ride up a very steep hill at 5 miles an hour and when I get to the top of the hill be really slow and gently stop bike @ the top of it.  Then I’d apply brake and I can balance the bike for about three seconds four seconds.

We will hire him again at the MX track & probably have him adopt us, if he needs people to sweep the floor< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I spend 4 hours with Edgar and it was a great experience. Edgar was knowledgeable and very professional. We were riding somewhere close to San Diego and I improve a lot and got ton of good pointers. Looking forward to be in that area again to ride with them again.
Daniel is great with replying to emails and phone calls.</review>

Having just spent the weekend training with Daniel Sedlak, I can strongly recommend his school.

Daniel takes the time to get to know each person he's working with and their individual skill level. His ability to communicate and coach each technique is extremely high and his knowledge of all aspects of off road riding is excellent. Combine this with a very positive attitude, a desire to see his pupils develop and a cracking sense of humour too!

My time with Daniel was money well spent. I have improved with so many aspects of my riding, become faster, more confident and overall a better rider. All this from a very well organised and fun weekend school.

Keep up the good work, Daniel... And thank you! I'll definitely be signing up for more training with you very soon!</review>

I signed my boys up for his training school all the way out in North Dakota. Both of my boys absolutely loved Daniel, and his teaching. What a wonderful experience for them, and I am so thankful that Daniel made the trip to ND to offer such a great training. I highly recommend taking his training. My boys were gifted dirt bikes for Christmas, and had never road before this class. They both came out with knowledge, and confidence. Thank you Daniel! Can’t wait until the boys are able to do this again.< /review>

<Text>I just wanted to give a shout out to Daniel and his team at SOS.  My situation was a bit different than most and Daniel really came thru.  My daughter has been living in rural Costa Rica for a few years without transportation.  She had signed another year contract so transportation was going to be necessary.  Where she lives it's either quads or motos.  She had never driven either and had no experience with a clutch of any sort.  I decided that over her Christmas visit she should get some motorcycle training to hopefully ease her anxiety of operating the motorcycle so she could be more comfortable and ultimately safe.

The Enduro training is what I thought would be most appropriate.  Daniel worked with her one on one for 4 hours.   He is one amazing instructor or she had hidden skills because I don't believe she stalled it more than 3 times total and the shifting and clutch work became second nature to her in a very short time.  He was able to get her practice on several types of terrain and dirt types that she will experience in CR.

She was not looking forward to the training as she thought it was not necessary.  It was not long before she had a smile on her face and a new found swagger as she realized that she had learned some new skills that she will actually use.  Her nervousness reduced throughout the day as she became more comfortable with the challenges Daniel would give her.

In the end I can truthfully say she actually enjoyed it!  This was evident by the many social media posts she made.  This was the exact experience that I wanted her to have and Daniel was exceptional with his knowledge and teaching skills.

Thanks Daniel for teaching her to become more comfortable and confident which will enhance her safety!   Pura Vida

1/27/2021. It has now been a year since my daughter Katie has been back in Costa Rica utilizing her off road skills everyday.  She commutes to work on her Honda Wave in every weather and road/trail condition possible. It was great to have her home for nearly a month over Christmas. But the greatest compliment of all for Daniel was the text I received the day after she got back to Costa Rica.  She simply said, after her long vacation. “I fell in love with my moto all over” thanks Daniel!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc72f118f94aa3:0xf8eecc4a950e7ec7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you get an opportunity to take this class with Daniel. Do it!

I have riden over 50,000 miles and counting and over the years I have had some amazing experiences on my motorcycles.

Riding with Daniel was one of the best experiences I’ve had on two wheels.

Seriously take this class, it will ignite or reignite your passion for the sport like you wouldn’t believe.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><review>What a great training school.  I was highly impressed with the way the training was put together and run.  The trainers work very well with all ages of kids and they train kids to do things the right way.  Many good real life stories to help people understand the world of motocross in every aspect. It is meant to be fun but if you want to get pushed to the limit they will also push you to get the most out of the training course your ability will let you.  Sent my son to one training class and cant wait for him to go again next spring.  Well worth the money.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

This review is for the Enduro Training class.  I chose to do a 1-on-1 class with Daniel, and we met at McCain Valley east of San Diego.  McCain offered lots of varied terrain that was perfect for our whole day of training.  I consider myself to be a novice to intermediate rider, and I had specific things I wanted to work on.  Daniel had a great plan for the whole day and we slowly built up the difficulty of riding as I progressed.  Not only did I learn new skills, but we also went over bike setup and we made some very minor tweaks that resulted in big gains in comfort and confidence.  I also walked away with new drills that I can do before I ride, that will help with my balance and control.  I felt like a new rider on a new bike by the time we were done.  I highly recommend Sedlak Offroad School for any enduro training you need.  I plan on doing it again with some friends next time so I can watch them struggle through the drills!< /text>

<Review>I like supporting local businesses and this shop is cool. My son wanted his first skateboard for his birthday. The staff were helpful, and the owner was nice. I took my son  in and they offered good advice.  This place is small but has a lot of items to choose from.  It could have been overwhelming but we were given information and we decided on a complete board that was already assembled rather than a true custom board.  He picked a complete that had a graphic he liked.  He is a satisfied customer as am I.  I will go back and replace my deck with a blank.< /Review><user_name>Glen Inokuchi<//user_name><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

If I could give you this place 10 Stars I would the owner that helped me hooked it up with some free hardware they got good prices on wheels they have everything you could ever imagine skateboarding or riding on Rollerblades or whatever. There I was super nice to me even though they were closing they weren't rushing me. I left to a very happy a customer. I definitely will be going there again<//Review>

Best skate shop around. All other "skate" shops in my area mostly just sold clothes with like one or two decks available. This place has racks of completes and walls of  decks.< /Text>

<Review>Grew up here and now live in NYC but will always go in a buy some stuff and chat it up with the owner. The dude has some great stories of the old school of skaters. One of the best skate shops around. Good prices and great legacy history with a board museum of decks. Support local skateboard shops!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Gave them a call to asking about inline skates, he said "no dont have any", and said "try Play it again sports" and Hung Up....? What great customer service thanks for the recommendation,  y'all are some fools. Maybe I'll stop by and change my mind, will see. Will keep ya'll updated.<//text>

<Review>The best skate shop by far!!! You won't find a better selection or more knowledgeable staff. This is a place where real skaters go not a wanna be place. And the owner James is a real skater and knows not only the current stuff as to what is good and what's not. But look around the shop he goes way back in the sport.<//Review><response>None<//response><name>Brad Sawyer</name><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1535802057871</Time></record>

South Bay Skates is by far the best skate shop in the area. It has a massive selection of boards for a reasonable amount. This store has just what you'll need from scooters, skates wheels, boards, etc.  The owner is a very friendly person and helped me find exactly what i was looking for. Not to mention their amazing museum.</Review>

Guy pulled out a tazer and started zapping it while i was trying on sunglasses because he was scared. Small dirty mirror above a fishtank didn't let me get a good look so i just bought the $100 shades because he was making me nervous with the tazer. I got home and didn't like the shades aterall. Went back the next day to return them and they wouldn't. Don't give your money to these shady dudes.</review>

We were excited to try out the place. The inside looks amazing but after we were seated, no one came back to our table. We waited 25 minutes and nothing. A table that was seated 20 minutes after us, were seen and drinks taken. They were not under staffed and seen hanging out in the front. Worst service I have ever experienced!</Text>

<review>I really like the idea of having an online menue. You pretty much scan a digital code already set up on your table (rather than having standard menu that everyone else touches). Long list of tap beer to choose from. Our food was flavorful, delicious and came in big portions. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and making sure we had everything we needed.

Surprised it was good on our 1st visit since it changed it's name. Last time (Spike & Rail) here it wasn't good. Our waitress was attentive & took good care of us on our 48th anniversary. Thanks again Sierra!!< /review>

Decided to challenge the claim of best tri tip on the 99. It was pretty darn good, I will let them keep their claim. They have some wicked sounding hamburgers,  going to try one of them next time. Onion rings are hand made, killer garlic fries.

They serve good food. I love their pork belly burger. It takes a while to get served so you need to be patient.</text>

Service was good beer was good  there was four of us one order was right three were wrong. I ordered the 12oz ribeye steak medium and it was cooked wrong. It was a 32 dollar meal I can tell you not worth 32 dollars. It didn't even look like a ribeye it didn't look right . My dad ordered the sirloin steak medium rare and it came out well done . JD ordered a burger that was supposed to have bacon avacodo tomato. Everything on it it came out a plain burger with cheese nothing else with it . That other was fish and chips was right but he said had no flavor. So not a good experience first time any of us have been there. Just not good food and not cooked right or made right.</text>

Came here for dinner and ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables, side of cedar salad and an appetizer of calamari. The food was fresh and made to order. It was all very delicious. The service was quick and it didn’t take long to get my food after placing an order 20 mins prior. Seems the restaurant is allowing dine in and is following all the COVID requirements so come out here and enjoy eating inside a restaurant again.< /Review><user>113649805702853342343<//user><Time>1594466683955</Time><gmap_id>0x8094f1c27b9ecefb:0x376ee8ee90b4125e< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

Nice and clean atmosphere with really good food. We had a chimichurri crostini for an appetizer, steak was cooked perfect and was very tender. Entrees were bbq bacon burger and tri tip sandwich, both were excellent.<//review>

We made a service request for maintenance to check our dryer because we noticed a smell like something was burning. Lately, we also have been repeating the process of drying our clothes because they do not dry with just one cycle.
We specifically requested for Ruel who did a great job cleaning the duct. It turns out there was a lot of lint that filled a trash bag, he found a piece of wood & a dead bird inside the dryer duct! We always request for Ruel when we need maintenance because he is very considerate, always wears a mask & always puts shoe covers before entering our apartment and more importantly cleans up after completing his task. Thumbs up for this guy! Good job! I give him 6 stars!!!!< /text>

<review>Our apartment's bathroom sink hadn't been draining properly for over a week. Tony Garcia came through and did an excellent job clearing it; he was quick, thorough, and provided a courtesy call/time frame before arriving to fix it. Avalon Walnut Ridge is such a wonderful place to live, and maintenance calls like this are part of the reason why.< /review>< pictures>

Well, a good place to get a taste of old, poorly maintained apartments. This place has lots of areas to be improved. Leaking windows for one. Mold issues. Also there is this broken waste water pipe that consistently dumps sudsy water from somebody’s shower into the ground floor parking garage. I’ve reported the leak to the maintenance office, and they marked the request complete, but no work to the pipe has been done to this day...
When it was time for us to renew our lease those guys offered new leasing terms with the rent that went up amid the 2020 pandemic and plummeting rents in this area... The responsiveness of the management in this matter was so timely that I ended up signing a lease in the same neighborhood for the same size apartment, but with the rent $220 lower before getting any counter-offer (I decided to stop waiting in about 3-5 days after sharing my concerns with the management). Surprisingly, the quality of the new apartment is way above what we had with Avalon. Which brings me to the next point - even if the apartment is noisy (bart line is 50 ft away), dirty (we moved in into an apartment with an unwashably stained carpet nearby the apartment entrance), dark, moldy, and smells of sewer out of the plumbing fixtures - they keep raising rent.
Another fun observation : the majority of AC units (split-system heat pumps) is original, built in 1987... I guess they don’t care as long as the electricity bill is on the tenants.

The bottom line is: I’ve never felt so poor paying $2,200 a month! It would’ve been a great community, but there is way too many buts. No wonder those guys have consistently been having over 30 vacant 1-bedroom apartments this year, while their next door neighbors of the same size might have 5. If you don’t face dire time frames or other challenges, keep looking around. There are much better and/or cheaper places in this area of Walnut Creek / Pleasant Hill.<//text>

<review>This review is for Ruel in maintenance. For two months in a row my pg&e bills were over $550 and after having pg&e come take a look I submitted a request for someone at Avalon to investigate. He quickly identified and fixed the issue within a day of submitting the maintenance request.</review>< userid>

<Text>I moved in recently and want to share my experience with the maintenance process. Avalon Walnut Ridge is a large community but to my surprise, when I submitted a service ticket, I got a call from Francisco right away and he was able to get my dish washer fixed the very next day.  The service was fast, respectful and professional.< /Text><time>1620428994314< /time><gmap_id>0x8085610fabd2df49:0x632f2d24644612e1< /gmap_id></record>

So far so good!!! Mary, Brendan and Keith have been a joy to work with from initial lease signing and setup to maintenance requests. The complex is clean, safe and quiet. Location is great and pretty IMHO. Take a walk down Cherry Lane!

Prior to Avalon Walnut Ridge I owned a condo for 20 years. Poorly managed and maintained. They can take a page out of Avalon WR’s book.

As far as rentals go Avalon WR so far is number one. I’ve experienced 2 rental complexes in my life and awful!

I hope management continues to maintain and manage the complex the way it has been. I hope to stay here for a while if it does.

Also, the entire staff is so friendly-so refreshing! They always greet me and my dog with a smile.
Hope this helps for future tenants to want to live here!<//review>

Shout out to Tony Garcia with the maintenance team.  He just came by and fixed my washing machine.  I thought no way this thing could be fixed.  he is a very skilled appliance technician.   He diagnosed the problems instantly and got right to work on it.  My dryer was a victim of the washing machine going berserk as well.  He fixed that up lickity split as well.  Thanks Tony!<//text>

Appreciate the service provided by Ruel for our maintenance requests for our apartment. Not only was Ruel transparent, but also provided lead time on when service would be done and when he and his team would need to come in to do the service required. Also appreciate that he wore booties inside our apartment to keep any dirt/dust outside of our apartment. SALAMAT!< /review>

I had a problem with AC leaking and needed immediate action from maintenance. Ruel came to the rescue and fixed it all. Ruel was also very kind to call me afterwards and explain to me what was wrong and further what can prevent this in future. I would highly recommend Ruel for any future maintenance work.</Review>

<Text>While you see some negative reviews on google, as a current tenant who has lived at this location for 2 years, I can assure you the apartment quality has been equivalent to anywhere else I have seen in the bay.

I will say, the biggest contributor to this review is the great management team at my location. Brandon Cole recently took it upon himself to correct a few things I had recently had some issues with and really handled it not only like a professional, but as someone I felt personally felt like making sure things were right.

An apartment is simply an apartment at the end of the day, but when a staff member makes you feel cared for, that’s a much bigger win!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

I can't wait to move in! Disclaimer: Lease starts mid month, review is based on service to date and informal, self-directed property tour. If there is cause to update review after move in then I will, but as of now super excited to call Avalon Walnut Ridge my future home.

Service: Sylvia has been incredible. Seriously. I couldn't imagine a more attentive, thoughtful and professional point of contact. Responsive, personalized and helpful assistance.
Simply put, she's awesome!

Grounds: Coming from a *luxury* complex in San Ramon that has seen better days and is now horribly mismanaged/outdated despite being located in a highly expensive, suburban area. Walnut Ridge by comparison was far cleaner, updated and possessed better amenities based on value. So much gorgeous and well manicured greenery!

Unit: Spacious and renovated Modern Collection studio, see pics with labeled detail. Also, please note property map. Its extremely helpful when choosing a unit depending on preference. For example, I prioritized hard surface flooring (currently available in first floor units only), updated appliances and at least a partial nature view from the balcony vs. solely looking toward another building. If you aren't sure about specific unit amenities or location simply inquire.

Area: Safeway, Target, Century 14, Starbucks, Restaurants, Iron Horse Trail, Pleasant Hill Bart, 680 access etc., all within a 10 minute walk or drive. Perfect!

Potential Cons: Perfection is an illusion. Period. Figure out whether the cons outweigh the pros and go from there. Here's my list based on touring and reading past reviews.
1.) Buildings with certain units directly across from Bart tracks (107, 109, 997...)may come with an uncomfortable noise level. Choose wisely based on personal needs.
2.) As with any pet friendly environment you will have tenants who do not pick up after or follow guidelines for their pets. Sucks, thats life.
3.) Car Break-Ins, this one is pretty concerning. When walking around its not hard to see how this consistently happens, anyone can slip into the garages from off the street. Honestly, I'm wondering if it might be better to park in the open by the leasing office rather than the assigned underground space.
4.) Homeless Issue - This is a factor but its one prevalent in most major urban areas, especially with Bart being close.
5.) Water/Garbage not included. This will be an adjustment, however, since this community is roughly $300 less monthly than my last residence and has far better amenities its hardly a deal breaker.

Thats all I have for now, take care and stay safe!< /Text>

Great location and friendly staff, thats about where it ends.  Our rent has been increased every year despite the fact that amenities have been reduced.  We no longer have a security guard patrolling the area to prevent vandalism and break ins, which has been on the rise.
Despite some of the draw backs there are with this place, no place is mistake free and the staff and layout of the apartments are great. The staff did help us out with multiple issues and were always very positive.<//review>

<Name>Christina Lei-Aloha Belle< /Name><date>1606671758853< /date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I moved into Avalon Walnut Ridge almost two years ago.

Location: Great location, accessible to food and BART. Safe and is gated with code required.

Apartments: Clean, with high-end appliances and plenty of room for storage. Pre-COVID, the dog park and gym were always clean.

Maintenance Staff (main reason for 5 stars):
The maintenance staff is always professional and prompt in responding to maintenance requests. All requests have been serviced within 2 days. Ruel always comes prepared and with shoe coverings. He completes the job and does not complain about my loud small dog that always barks at him. Last year I found mold under my mattress and he was kind enough to remove the mattress from my apartment and dispose of it free of charge. He let me borrow a dehumidifier for the week. My husband and I gave him a thank you card and box of chocolates for all of his hard work.

Leasing Office Staff:
It is very difficult to get ahold of the leasing staff, either by email or by phone. Most of the time I have to leave a voicemail or my email is not replied to. It took 4 months to receive a personalized gate code despite emailing and calling the office on five or more occasions. When moving to a different unit, we were shown a unit that was "already rented". We should not have been shown the unit if it was not available. We had agreed to sign the contract right after the showing but I was told it was not available. There was a lot of back and forth in order to find another unit to move into. [Reason for moving: regular noise from the upstair unit and wanted to increase from a 1 bed Modern to 2 bed Premier unit]. An example of not following through is the results of the Halloween Pet Costume Contest. No winner was ever announced and relayed to the residents. I also referred a friend to Avalon Walnut Creek, but there was no area in their application to put my information to receive the referral housing credit that is advertised. I have sent multiple emails to Avalon Walnut Ridge and Avalon Walnut Creek with no response.</Text>< pics>

We have lived at Avalon Ridge in Walnut Creek for 4 years and absolutely love it here!  It is very quiet, beautiful and full of professionals who care about our community.  It is a 6 minute walk from the BART station and Bike Trails.  The office and groundskeepers as well as the maintenance crew are nice, friendly, professional and truly care and take care of you.  If you are looking for a quiet, green and pretty place to live - this is it!<//Text>

<Review>We lived at Walnut Ridge in 2017 and have moved with Avalon since - first to AVA Nob Hill in SF - and now moving to AVA Cortez Hill in San Diego.

Lisa and Kayla helped us out of a pretty bad roommate situation when we were trying to move to Walnut Ridge and made the transition super smooth. The apartment was nice, we were not in the upgraded apartments, but they got the job done, private and spacious. Maintenance is great at all properties, very responsive and polite.

Highly recommend this property for it's awesome staff, nice amenities, and convenience to BART.</Review></record>

<review>If you are thinking about applying to move into Avalon Walnut Ridge, I would emphatically suggest you to avoid them like the plague for your own good. I visited and toured a unit, really liked it along with the surrounding area, and decided to apply. Everything went relatively smoothly until then. My roommate and I were notified that we had to fill out the application and submit it completely within 24 hours (strange, but fine it's doable). We submitted our applications completely, and we were contacted by Sylvia to get more information. She notified us that she needed information that we had put in the application, but for some reason had not gone through. Some problem with I.T.? Weird, but fine, we did so. We then noticed the next day, the rent on the unit we were applying to had increased by 200 dollars. We did not want the unit at that price, so we asked Sylvia which price we would be paying (the original, or the updated), to which she replied, and I quote, "Yes'em!". Our entire correspondence with Sylvia and other staff are filled with  absurd, Kafqaesque replies that either demanded sensitive information we already put in the application or were plainly unhelpful. Following up that application, we had to fill out a followup from a sketchy-looking "NoReply" email address with the wrong phone number at the bottom, asking even more bizarre questions like my astrological sign, car loans I have taken, retail cards I have, etc, to "verify my identity." As if my driver's license and social security number aren't good enough, but my astrological sign will close the case. They will then gaslight you into thinking that everything they are doing is "normal practice." This is not normal practice. It is highly unethical to demand someone to send sensitive information such as your SSN over email, much less demand it within 24 hours, after you ALREADY sent it in the application. I am HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS of their practices, AGGRAVATED by the obtuseness of their staff, and FED UP knowing that they are probably making more money keeping our application fees than they are actually renting.</review>< date>

Avalon is an absolutely fantastic apartment to live in, and Avalon Walnut Ridge is no exception. The community is very calm and relaxing -- and quite beautiful! It's incredibly close to BART and many local stores and restaurants. Moreover, the Leasing Office staff are extremely kind and helpful; definitely willing to work with you on any issues you might have. In particular, Kimmie is super great! Definitely rent here.

I love living at Avalon Walnut Ridge. I have a great 2 bedroom, top floor apartment and so far I have had very quiet neighbors (or the soundproof is good!) which is a HUGE requirement for me. The amenities are great and CJ & Kimmie and the rest of the office staff are easy to work with, responsive and so nice! In addition, the complex is a quick 5-7 minute walk to Pleasant Hill Bart - a big perk for those who commute! Definitely recommend this community - I don't plan to leave until I move out of the area or buy!</text>

<Review>My fiancé and I just recently moved to Avalon Walnut Ridge and couldn’t be happier! Firstly, Vivie has been amazing since day one when we toured the place. She’s been helpful, kind, friendly, and accommodating. Our unit was being completely renovated during the past week or so, and Angelica (resident services coordinator) along with the contractors (I believe Emanuel or Manuel is the name of the foreman but not 100% sure) have been nothing short of wonderful. The renovation process ran smoothly and was completed in a timely manner. The contractors worked efficiently. A few times throughout the week I had to come back to our apartment to grab something and the contractors were nice and quick to stop their work to help me access the bedroom. Angelica updated us every step of the way. She has been considerate, professional, and very pleasant! Our renovated apartment looks amazing and we are truly excited. Thanks to all again!!< /Review>< rating>

We love living here at Avalon Walnut Ridge! The staff is all very friendly and most work orders are completed within 24 hours. It is only a five minute walk to the BART station for my husband and my toddler and I love walking around the garden pathways and hanging out at the pool. Very pet friendly as well and quiet enough at night not to wake up our toddler. :) Would definitely recommend!<//review>

<Review>My wife and I moved in last October, due to the high rent in San Francisco. I was a skeptical at first with this late 80’s designed and equipped housing complex. But soon after the move I couldn’t help to notice that Walnut Ridge was a diamond in the rough.

On the outside we have a peaceful environment: trees, squirrels and ducklings. It is pedestrian friendly and near BART and the Iron Horse Trail. Inside the complex we have a well maintained swimming pool, jacuzzi, outdoor barbecue and exercise room. The Walnut Ridge experience is enhanced with a friendly and helpful office staff, and hard working and skilled maintenance crew.

Yet it is a diamond in the rough. The units are a bit dated and are showing wear and fatigue. The good news is the maintenance crew is skilled and thorough. Futhermore the management is committed (and we already seeing the results) to renovate and upgrade the complex. Or should I say provide shine to this diamond

Bottom line.... we are quite pleased with the Walnut Ridge experience.</Review>< user>

I would say I am very pleased with the quick resolutions and responses we get from the Management Office and the maintenance team. I would like to commend, Mary for her attentiveness, helpfulness, and great service every time I have a question or concern.  I would also like to thank and commend Ruel from the maintenance team for resolving issues and repairing things that break in our apartment. Ruel is very quick with his work but very clean and orderly at the same time. He also goes over and beyond what is expected of him. In fact, I specifically request for him when I submit a service request because he is courteous, quick, cleans up after himself and always gets the job done. :)  In the 5 years that I have lived at Avalon Walnut Ridge, I have had no problems with maintenance and repair requests. Thank you Ruel and Mary for making living in this community a great experience. I hope you keep up the good work and great service.<//Review>< user>

I called with a sink overflowing from backup and no idea where the water was coming from.  Tony Garcia arrived and was a man of action and awesomeness, it took a lot of snaking and had to swap out some components but it was done with professionalism and a smile.  As always I am very happy to have such great support from the maintenance team and great response.< /Review>

<Review>Been living at Avalon Walnut Ridge for 2 years and a half now, and it has been a great experience, from the leasing office to the maintenance team. Every question or issue were answered instantaneously. Hope this team doesn't change because it would be a shame! They are one of the reasons that create a great community.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>100730861247298958102<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<user_id>100386306491019108686<//user_id><Text>I am fortunate enough to be able to make the jump to home ownership now, but leaving the life here at Avalon Walnut Ridge is bittersweet. The management team that I have had the pleasure of interacting with during my time here is second to none. Lisa, Kimmie, and CJ are kind, friendly, professional, and actually care about your experience and well being during your time here. I can easily say that this renting experience has been the least stressful from a leasing standpoint, and I have been renting for 10 years now at various locations. Not only is the staff genuinely willing to make your time here the best possible, but the amenities are fantastic as well. The grounds are equipped with a beautiful pool with modern furniture, a fully equipped weight and training room, yoga and meditation room, social space to watch the game, and well kept stainless gas grills to make any occasion better. My apartment is modern, with beautiful quartz counter tops, modern hardware, stainless appliances, and clean lines. Everything is well kept on the property and I'm certain that the management and maintenance team pride themselves on that. I know I sound like an advertisement, but I cannot express my gratitude enough towards the team here. Live here. You won't regret it.</Text>< Rate>

<review>I am not a resident yet, but I am relocating from North Carolina for a job.  I was looking at Avalon Walnut Ridge in Walnut Creek to live.  I do appreciate the feedback everyone has provided on the staff, however,  I was hoping to hear more about the facility itself and the amenities.  I have deduced that the tenants have no complaints and if something does need to be fixed the staff is effective, efficient and productive.

I am relying on reviews to decide where I will live, since I am not from this area.  Avalon definitely sounds like a place, I would want to call my home  for the next 15 - 24 months.  Thank you to everyone that posted here!!!!

I recently moved into the Ridge about 4 weeks ago, I must say I love the quiet, the atmosphere, despite someone stealing my picnic coolers left in my parking spot to dry out. Besides that IM VERY HAPPY and giving major props to KIMBERLY MARTIN as she is the one I had my tour with, she was gracious, friendly and made sure that my move in went smoothly. Everyone at the office is happy and pleasurable. I'm hoping as the weather warms up I will get to enjoy the new pool and meet other tenants. Overall the RIDGE is the place to be.</Text>

Coming from overseas to the US, I had no real clue about the rental market here and the team at Avalon were very good. Service Requests are answered extremely quickly and have always been satisfactory. Unfortunately due to my 2 year fixed pay for my work contract I could not afford to stay in Avalon Walnut Ridge when it came time for renewal, but I am exploring other Avalon communities who have a lower monthly rental cost. In summary, I would highly recommend living here.</review><Time>1439218734612< /Time>< UserId.>

<Review>My fiance and I moved in back in January of this year. When we first looked at Avalon Walnut Ridge we met with Lisa Dutta. She was amazing from the start. She had all the information we needed or requested to make our move in as easy as possible. She even went to lengths of taking measurements for us to buy furniture since our unit was under renovation. Since we've moved in she and the other office staff have always been friendly and helpful. We couldn't ask for a better staff to run our apartment complex!!

The apartments are also amazing. The community is well kept, and everyone is friendly. It is also conveniently close to BART, which is good for us since my fiance works in the city.

I would recommend these apartments to anyone that is looking for a beautiful complex, friendly neighbors, and easy access to commute.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Do not live here if you are planning to have a roommate or have a roommate situation. The staff is very rude and don't talk properly when you mention roommates!!!! I had really bad experience when I talked to them over phone and when I went there for apartment tour. The lady at the leasing office behaved very rudely and did not give me the information required. I went there on a Saturday. Both the ladies were obviously free and available. But, she bluntly told me I should get an appointment as they are not free and totally booked for the day. Stay away from this place if you plan on sharing this place with someone or plan on having a roommate.< /review>

<text>This is a very nice apt complex with extremely convenient access to the BART station, which is essential for people like me who work in downtown SF. Personally I think the rent is very reasonable, especially when you consider it's the bay area and it comes with a free, reserved, covered parking spot. Though the apartment itself is not as new or renovated as some other luxury apts, I don't really see it a problem. My apt is very comfortable and I haven't had any maintenance issues yet. The staffs are also very friendly and helpful, and I do like the community events they hold every now and then, like the Food Truck Wednesday. Overall I'm very glad I called Avalon Walnut Ridge home when I first move to CA.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>First review but will update after I move in! Huge thank you to Salvador Millado (Sal), he is the most professional, kind, fun, direct, efficient, and transparent community consultant I have ever worked with and I have lived in over 3 countries and 6 different U.S. states. He is very knowledgable of the property and will go out of his way to accomodate you and answer all of your questions!

Avalon Walnut Ridge was the first complex in WC I looked at with my family and we were all in awe at first sight and this was not even the Premier back/gated side yet! I was pretty much sold already.  I needed to be close to BART as my husband will be working in SF, and me close to the highway as I'll be commuting to Antioch. This place was close enough to both but tucked away in a foresty like area that seemed very secure, safe and quiet.  To give all the other complexes (and myself) a fair chance I looked at over 5 others: Avalon walnut creek, AVE, Vaya, Arroyo, Avalon Eaves, and Lyric. The apartments closer to WC downtown (AVE, Lyric, Vaya) were nice but a lot more expensive and also could get pretty noisy. Living closer to the WC/Pleasant Hill border made more sense with downtown a 10 min drive away.  Avalon Walnut Creek was probably my second choice given proximity to BART and retail shops right below you however there was a lot of traffic noise, and I found working with the leasing office not to be as easy or smooth.  I made a second visit to Avalon walnut ridge but this time saw the back units where it is gated and with elevators as well as a jacuzzi, fitness center, wifi lounge and BBQ areas. It felt more like home, was SO quiet (could hear birds chirping!) and could only hear the BART station outside of the apartment and as you walk further away, as the apartment has double pane windows to block out sound pretty well.  The view of the courtyard with pool and jacuzzi could not be beat! The elevators going directly from the basement parking to my floor made it convenient as far as safety and moving things to and from my car.  The amazon hub for packages is nearby as well as mailboxes so I will never have to worry about my packages getting lost.   The appliances and finishes of the apartment are very modern, clean and just as nice as some of the other newer apartments in downtown walnut creek but at a little over half the price.  My husband likes to eat out and walk a lot, the retail shops at Avalon Walnut Creek and starbucks is about a 7 min walk, and the Iron Horse trail seems really nice to walk the kids or dogs around and I found it to be a very family and pet-friendly community. From what I understand the Iron Horse trail takes you to downtown walnut creek as well about a 30-40 min walk or 10 min drive which seems like a nice thing to do on the weekends or after work!

All in all, I think I found the perfect place to live and if it was not for Sal being so prompt, direct and welcoming this decision could have been a lot harder! He even face-timed me twice to look at the current open units as I am currently out-of-state and could not go there physically. He also welcomed my family and showed them around when I could not. The way he treated my family as well as I, really solidified that this is the place I want to be, where the management and staff treat you as if you are family and truly care about your well-being and concerns! I’m excited to become a part of the community and to work with the rest of the team as I know they will be just as wonderful from the reviews I have read (Cierra in leasing, and the fantastic maintenance crew!)

I could not be happier with my decision and I will be writing another updated review after move in next month! Thank you again Sal for your wonderful service and support!!!</text>< Time>

Water supply line leakage at Saturday so I called the service team immediately and Dustin showed up in 5 minutes and helped fixed the plumbing line with his expertise but also spent sometime in cleaning up everything from the little flood!  If you experienced the frustration seeing water flushing out from the supply line in your room, you will understand the hopeless and how important that some professional could just shows up in minutes. Give 5 stars because there is no option for a higher score, or I would give 10 stars. Also neighbors are nice too, they heard noises, came out to see me and tried to give hands.< /Text>

<Review>Kayla Chamberlin (Garcia) has been terrific and has gone above and beyond for us in our move from the East Coast to the West Coast. She has been extremely attentive to all of our needs, and we couldn't be more thankful to have worked with her during our move west.

No noise isolation between apartments. Security or Avalon team doesn't want to resolve the issue with a noisy neighbor at all. The pool is still close despite Contra Costa cancel the restriction.</review>

I was calling from SoCal and she sent me photos that she personally took of the apartments available.  Then she waited late in the office to meet me with a key on move-in day because I was travelling so far by myself.  What an angel!  The office staff, maintenance guys, and neighbors have been absolutely delightful ever since I moved here 6 months ago.  Having BART within a short walk away has been a blessing too!</review>< Pictures>

Avalon made my move from the east coast to the west coast easy and reliable. Lisa and Taemon were very helpful and co-operative and thoroughly assisted throughout the moving process! Because of it's proximity to the BART and easy commute to the SF city, I'd highly recommend this complex to everyone!</Review>

< review>
It's not if your car will be broken-in, it's when.
Their security is a joke, and higher management just don't care. When I took the security matter to higher management, their response was "this happens in big cities"

So we (our friends too), left.

And yes, once you leave, which I and my friends did, be ready to pay a big $$ for re-painting and other fictional damage you have caused.

I was charged for painting the entire apartment even though after multiple inspections the inspector stated no paining required. When I called the inspector to state I've been charged for painting contrary to his advice, he was apologetic and said there is nothing he could do once management decide to hit you with the bill.

I fought it hard and got a reduced bill, but the stress of it all just not worth it.
You can do better.

The one star I gave is for the girls at the reception, they are outstanding. One of the  them (Kristy) carried a pram for us all the way to 3rd floor, considering my wife was pregnant and I was at work... angel!< /review>

<Review>I am new to this community and I have no complaints at this point.  Many amenities are within walking distance: BART, Iron Horse Trail, Sprouts, Seven 11, Bev Mo, Walgreen's, among a few.
The office staff is always friendly and helpful and the community is very pleasantly quiet.
It is pet friendly without the silly weight restrictions.
I would recommend Avalon Walnut Ridge to friends and family.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I just moved from San Francisco to Walnut Creek last month, and so far we're in love with it, our new apartment here being the highlight. In-unit laundry, balcony, walk-in closets, a gym, pool, balcony.... our apartment would cost 4K per month if it was in SF, and we're paying half that amount. And the area is great -- I love that our building is in a more quiet and secluded area, but you go 1 exit up the freeway and have access to literally anything you could think of in the way of shops, restaurants, and entertainment. And being walking distance to BART? Well that's just downright amazing.<//Review>

The complex is in the heart of a very walkable neighborhood, and minutes from the Pleasant Hill Bart, so a 30-40 min ride into the city. The apt was very clean when we moved in, and the maintenance crew is on top of it. I would highly recommend this community to anyone looking in the Walnut Creek area.< /Text>< pictures>

I want to start by saying there is wonderful leasing office staff and very prompt maintenance. That is unfortunately were the good ends. In terms of safety concerns, I've been chased by a man at night on the grounds of the complex and had my license plates stolen while parked here. Many vehicle breakins, catalytic converters stolen, mail stolen. It got to the point where I was going outside to check my car every day to make sure it wasn't broken into. I also recently moved out and they are trying to take over $200 out of my security deposit, saying I did not pay some of my utilities when I lived there even though my balance was $0 when I moved out and I paid in full every month. Feels like I am being scammed and having $200 stolen from me</Review>

<text>I wanted to acknowledge Tony Garcia for his level service and his skills. I  had a leak from air conditioner and he spent numerous hours working hard trying to get this problem resolved and as always he fix the problem. His customer service skills go above and beyond the call of duty, Tony Garcia always follows up with a phone call the next day to ensure that everything is running properly with our unit that's what I call customer service. Avalon Walnut Ridge has tremendous assets by having Tony Garcia being part of their team and hopefully he gets recognized and not just a pat on the shoulder.</text><resp>None<//resp>< time>

<text>My family has been living here for the past 8 years. There are are two main reasons that we call Avalon Walnut Ridge home:
1. Great people working at the leasing office
2. Great people working in the maintenance team
Needless to say that apartments themselves are awesome. They have been recently renovated and look just great. The space inside and outside of the complex is clean and well maintained. But as I said, the main reason we stay is the great service being provided by the team. If we make a service request we know in advance that the service will be provided within 24 hours with great quality. If we go to the leasing office we know that all our problems will be resolved by nice people working there.
I want to also mention one thing that is VERY unique to Avalon Walnut Ridge: management DOES listen to their residents!!! Resident complains would transform to REAL action or policy change here. Previous
residents' complains about difficult parking situation materialized into a policy change and strict parking enforcement when cars without resident's sticker would be towed away at owners expense. That made a huge difference. I usually come back from work later at night and I could not see available parking spots around my building before the policy
change. Now I do see them!
I am sure other residents could share similar experience.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Avalon Walnut Ridge is a great place to live. I have been a resident for over a year now. I like that my apartment has an in-unit washer and dryer and a fireplace! During the winter season, it was nice to build a fire and just relax in the comfort of my home. I like that Avalon has a garage for private parking spots, allows pets, and is literally 3 minutes walking distance to BART! It is also close to many eateries, shopping centers, malls, community parks and freeways (hwy 680,24, 4). The maintenance staff is very quick to respond and resolve issues and the office staff is friendly and welcoming. The office also hosts many fun events during holiday seasons and always get the residents involved in fun activities. Although the rent may be a pricey, let's just say "you get what you pay for" and I'm definitely getting my money's worth!<//text>< pics>

I moved to Avalon walnut ridge from Washington D.C in April. The leasing office went above and beyond expectations to accommodate me while being so far away. After moving Lisa and Kayla went out of there way to make sure everything was what I needed and wanted.

The small periodic maintenance I've needed has all been done timely and in a professional manner.Ive interacted and worked with everyone in the leasing office and they are all phenomenal and go out of the way to accommodate the residents.

The community is very friendly as well as pet friendly.Always very clean,quiet and well maintained. Once inside your apartment Bart noise is not noticeable.(my residence is facing towards Bart).

I'd recommend this apartment complex for everyone from single residents to families as it accommodates everyone and is inviting for all.</Text>

Hi everyone! We have some trouble with our sinks, and the man who’s solved this problem with a smile was Tony Garcia. Very professional, patient, benevolent! Thanks again Tony!
Don’t forget say “hello” if you meet someone of our Avalon employers!<//Review>

We wish to acknowledge the efforts of both David Duarte and Dustin Martin.  They are superstars!  This is the kind of service that keeps tenants supremely happy and long-term residents!  We are just overwhelmed with their exemplary service and pleasant attitude, in spite of the inconvenience to them on a Sunday, to take care of our hot water issues!  We would like to make sure they are commended for a job well done.  Their service is nothing short of "excellence in action"!< /Review>

<Review>I really want to give it a bad review because my rent keeps going up but I can't.  I really have no complaints.  This place is pretty low in rent compared to other apartments close to the Bart along the Pittsburg/Baypoint line.  It's a safe community, they keep the grounds nice and it's very close to great shopping and restaurants and within walking distance of BART.  They are friendly in the office and are prompt in letting me know packages have arrived for me.  The actual apartment isn't modern but it has washer and dryer in unit.  My only minor complaint is that the recycling dumpster could be emptied out more or they could have more of them.  Parking is usually not an issue.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><name>Kristin Quinn< /name><UserId.>110671905497493141062< /UserId.><time>1439250716021< /time>< rate>

Tony Garcia you are the man when it comes to solving service issues. hot water line to the kitchen faucet was leaking into the lower cabinet, you came in and had it repaired in a short period of time with minimal disruption.

Tony, you have saved the day..Again..my kitchen sink was backing up occasionally when the tenants upstairs would dump a large amount of water down their drain, you had the problem resolved in a few hours and came by my apartment to tell me what you had found. Thanx Again.

Thank's for replacing the drip tray underneath the air handler in the ceiling of my apartment, everytime i would run the AC it would start to rain in my hallway..Thanx Again<//text>

When I had to interact with maintenance staff have all been very friendly, especially Rowel , Rodel, Tim and an honorable mention for Tony Garcia , there is nothing he can not fix , and always with the best attitude and a smile from ear to ear, and patience to explain the why of everything he does . At Office Leasing  Taemon always is available to help and talk a little of everything.
Once I said they were not sweeping enough hallways and from the suggestion began to sweep more often. I really going to be sad when I have to move to another city.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I hired there services in 2018 - costing my over $5000. I understand each person case is different but what I don’t understand is how unprofessional this business is. It is really hard to get someone on the phone and when you do , it is a different person each time . I have dealt and spoken to over 5 people in this firm who are the assistant of the immigration lawyers. When I was on a payment plan they definitely made sure to call me each month for the payment. I received more communication during the payment process. once I finished paying they were never to be found. My case was given to Ms. Rodríguez and then when she left the firm my case was given to Mr. Antonio estrada who I have never spoken to and is hard to get a hold of. When I’m promised a call back. I do not get one just apologies. This is frustrating because it isn’t just myself - this is the status of my husband. This is horrible customer service and if things do not change then I will have to take my business elsewhere.</review>< pics>

I have dealt with immigration attorneys on both US coasts on an ongoing basis for the past 30 years or so, mostly related to employees but also to personal cases.  I was referred to Union Law Group by one of my top attorneys I had worked with in the past.  This most recent immigration case was probably the most complex case I have ever dealt with.  In fact, I was afraid there would simply be no legal avenue leading to a positive outcome.  Union Law Group, specifically attorneys Filex Sanchez and Ricardo Elorza, managed to untangle the intricacies of the situation and develop a multi-pronged strategy over the course of three years leading to a perfect outcome.  As expected, there were some temporary setbacks obliging the law firm to find new tactics along the way to finally reach the end goal.  Very impressive indeed.  I can’t emphasize enough the thoroughness, professionalism, attention to detail, personal engagement, dependable communication, and excellent counsel that was demonstrated during this elaborate legal case.  Hats off to both Filex and Ricardo and my great appreciation to both for having done an outstanding job.< /text>

I’m so tired to deal with them! Every time they promise me to call and talk about my case, but I never got call back from them. They even don’t know my case number, they never noticed me of any updates! I have no idea what’s going on with my case! I’m dealing with them 3 years! They did nothing!!!< /Text>

< Review>
Recently used Erika with Union Law Group to help with a visa for my wife. I was planning to do the paperwork myself but quickly realized that this was a much more complicated task. I really don't leave many reviews but Erika was great to work with. Immigration is not something to mess around with, you can make a mistake and it could cost you years or take away your opportunity. Spend a little money and use a professional. I'm definitely going to try to refer Erika some more business.....</Review>

Erika Rodriguez makes you feel like an actual person, not just another case on her desk. She is very involved and hands on,. While immigrating my husband, she went out and beyond to get our pardon waiver approved. It had initially gotten denied and as she had told us many times, our case was a very strong one, likely for approval. it was beyond our control, but she did not give up on us. She was determined to get us a good result, after many emails she got our case re-opened, and after her determination and time, we received the great news that our pardon waiver got approved.  At this point in time we are waiting for our appointment date to go to Juarez, Mx.
My entire family, my husbands family, and I are all so very grateful for her. I we will never be able to thank her enough.
We have referred many people to Union Law group and will continue to do so.
Felix Sanchez and Erika Rodriguez, thank you for having Great hearts and being humble.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I called the office to make an appointment but the person asked me what my question was, I explained my situation and told me that I have to wait. I do not know if I am a professional or know about immigration law but if you speak for an appointment I would like to ask a lawyer will get out of my doubts without less appreciating the work of the person who answers the phone because if I keep that answer, you may think that your case has no future, thank you.

(Original)
Hable a la oficina para hacer una cita pero la persona me pregunta que cuál es mi duda le explico mi situación y me dise que tengo que esperar no se si sea profesional  o sepa de leyes de inmigración pero si hablas para una cita yo quisiera que me sacara de mis dudas un abogado sin menos preciar el trabajo de la persona que contesta al teléfono porque si me quedo con esa respuesta tal vez creas que tu caso no tiene futuro gracias.< /text>

If we do not schedule an appointment, it is because perhaps it is not an area in which we can help you, it is not because your case has no solution.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Honestly at first the communication was super. We understand that many things changed in times of pandemic. Since 2019 we have a case with them, they changed my paralegal twice. This second time to be able to contact her is so difficult. Since November we do not know about her, she is busy or is not available, we left messages and to date we have not received calls. And if it is not that is that they will ask the lawyer and they will speak to us back. Even without knowing anything about our process for which we are paying. As is my case who knows, what progress has been made who knows. We do not expect that they are attending to us and updating us every 10 minutes, but at least that they remove us from our doubts but not for that they can return the calls.

Honestamente al principio la comunicación fue super.  Entendemos que en tiempos de pandemia cambiaron muchas cosas. Desde el 2019 tenemos caso con ellos, me cambiaron mi paralegal dos veces. Esta segunda vez para poderme contactar con ella es tan difícil.  Desde Noviembre no sabemos de ella se encuentra ocupada o no está disponible dejamos mensajes y hasta la fecha no nos han regresado las llamadas.  Y si no es eso es que le preguntaran al abodago y nos hablaran de vuelta. Igual sin saber nada de nuestro proceso por el cual estamos pagando. Como esta mi caso quien sabe, que progreso se ah hecho quien sabe. No esperamos que nos estén atendiendo y actualizando cada 10 minutos, pero al menos que nos saquen de nuestras dudas pero ni para eso pueden regresar las llamadas.<//Text><Rate>1<//Rate><username>Vane ROMERO<//username></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) It seems to be a pure story but it is not my experience with Filex lawyers and lawyer Josefina who alone helped me in the immigration process and the truth is that I am very surprised by how fast and effective my case was handled. so much that I had to cut my vacations for acapulco because of how fast they processed my case. I thank them with all my heart for having put a lot of effort into my case that the results were very satisfactory for me and my family. My family and I are grateful. Thank you lawyer Filex Sanchez and Josefina Carrillo for having put my heart and heart to my case for a thousand thanks.

Over all my experience was great from start to finish. Jay had walked us through our concerns with our current mattress and addressed all the needs we were looking for in our new one. Jay is very knowledgeable in his line of work and was able to relate with his own personal experiences which was a great help in choosing our new mattress. Thank you, we appreciate all your help!</Text>

<time>1620089897200< /time><Review>Our Sales associate MONICA was good enough at her job to show us all the options, pitfalls and benefits of the store products without the need for pressuring us or rushing us into a decision. She made sure we were able to purchase the correct bed for us at a price we wanted to pay and she arranged to have it delivered tomorrow and have our old bed taken away at the same time. We will see how the bed treats us over the next ten years but we are pleased to report that the service we received from MONICA was exemplary.
We suggest and recommend Mattress Firm to all who read this review and who may enjoy a fun and classy selling experience.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Samantha R. Was and awesome associate! She was all about educating so we could make the best choice for us. Thus far I can only speak to this part of the process. Once we decided it was fast and easy! We should receive our bed tomorrow and I hope the rest of the experience and of course bed is just as amazing.<//Text>

<text>We had a very good experience shopping for our new King mattress and base--to our surprise.  Jay Gordon was our salesperson at Mattress Firm, and he made what could have been a difficult experience pleasant and informative.  Jay had a wealth of relevant information about different mattress and base options, but he was never pushy or intrusive as my wife and I evaluated a large number of options.  Ultimately, we selected a mattress/adjustable base combo, an Intellibed Midnight King, that should serve us well, and give us good sleep, for 20 years.  Grateful for the excellent service and Jay's patience and willingness to negotiate a deal that was fair and which we could afford.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Ken J was my sales dude today and did a great job walking me through options, things to consider and was super knowledgeable on all the products and benefits. This is the first bed I have bought in about 15 years and wanted to ensure my investment in a restful sleep was well informed and by a reliable and reputable local company, not a discount store. Great deal, pricing is what it is with Tempurpedic, but they had some good offers going on and have a 120 day trial and price guarantee. Also have a 10 year warranty on the mattress and adjustable frame. Thanks Ken, much appreciated. Military discount available  also, but not on items with sales or fixed pricing.<//text></record>

Excellent experience with salesman Jay Gordon. Knows everything you ever need to know about the products. Very patient while I made a decision and answered all of my questions and guided me thru the buying process with ease.
My new bed will arrive in 2 days and I am hoping it lives up to the standard I expect it will!</review>

Ken is a mattress salesman extraordinaire!
He guided me through the store to find my perfect mattress.  I had been shopping at other store brands recently with sub par results.   Sure, must store carry the same brands, even the same models of mattresses.  But Ken at Mattress Firm made all the difference in the world.  He was able to cut through the subtle differences and help me understand how to choose my new mattress.

Everyone is different, which is why there are thousands of mattresses out there to choose from.  Take your time.  It is an investment in your well-being.
I KNOW I have the best mattress for ME.  He will find yours too!< /text>

Went in to try out a mattress to replace a dying sleep number bed.  The associates were knowledgeable about their products and covid careful while letting us test out the feel of the different options.  We were able to quickly settle on the one we wanted, ordering was relatively easy and we were able to pick our delivery day.  The whole thing took less than hour.</Text>

< Review>
The customer service at this store is unmatched. My husband and I walked in on a rainy Saturday just browsing around. We weren’t too sure what kind of mattress we were looking for. Jay showed us all types of mattresses and really took the time explaining all the different options we had. He wasn’t pushy and VERY patient. Even when we said we were leaving to another store he didn’t try to stop us or tell us not to go to another competitor. We eventually came back that same day and bought an amazing mattress (and some other goodies for the new bed)!!! But what really reaffirmed my trust for Jay as salesperson and the store was when we accidentally ruined a new fancy memory foam pillow that we purchased (read the directions) and we called back for help. Jay helped us out without hesitation and that really shows the kind of customer service that this store has and how they value their customers. They could have told us it’s our problem but they did the right thing. That’s why I will always recommend that if anybody is looking for a new mattress to shop at this store and MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR JAY!!!!< /Review>

<review>I went into Mattress Firm today @ the Fire Mountain location as was helped by their salesperson Ken. I found him to be very patient and knowledgeable with all the questions I bombarded him with.

He didn’t rush or pressure me for a decision. He took time and asked that I try different beds so that I could actually feel the difference. He didn’t try to upsell me on bases and he well could have as I really wouldn’t have known the difference. Instead he tried to work within my budget and worked to save me money where he could and even price matched on a couple of things saving me even more money.

The other nice thing I found with Mattress Firm is that what you see in the store they actually have in stock and is readily available which isn’t the case with many of the other stores I’ve visited in my search for mattresses for my home.

I will definitely be purchasing from Mattress Firm for these current rooms and for my other bedrooms in the future.</review><GmapID>0x80dc718e6307fd7f:0x88f3c17c8fef0f4c<//GmapID><Time>1614817929545< /Time>< rating>

My experience at mattress firm was amazing. My girlfriend and I went in just looking for a new mattress both agreeing on our way into the store we weren’t buying one (but we did). Ken, who helped us find out what style bed we wanted was very friendly and helpful. He was patient with us and broke down every detail on any question we had. Would recommend this location and going through ken to anyone who’s looking to buy.< /Text>

<Review>After having back pain for a few month on our 10+ yr old mattress, it was time to change it up. Went in knowing what we wanted and spent 2+ hours at this location narrowing down our favorites. Jay and ken were both great and patient knowing that I am very OCD with my choices. Both were up front with everything and kind. Got our mattress within 2 days and haven't had back pain since. If we ever need another mattress we will be going back.

We got the Hybrid silver chill plus with an adjustable base.</Review>< user>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>5 STARS!!! I definitely recommend this Mattress Firm store in Oceanside. Yesterday, we called them in advance and the employee, Sam, answered the phone. We told him we were looking to buy a TempurPedic  Mattress, asked if they sell them, and if there were any on the sales floor so we could test it out. He said most definitely. He was very cordial and professional. He answered all of our questions. Such a nice guy. We came in the store a few hours later where Sam was there to help us. He was so friendly we struck up a conversation with him on how we had gone thru 3 different mattresses already, all of which were advertised as super soft but when we received them, they were super firm and hard that it hurt my back. We thought we’d settle on a TempurPedic since we’ve heard they were really good. More expensive than the knock off brands but totally worth it. We’ve never bought a TempurPedic before let alone tested one out, so we had a lot of questions for Sam. Again, Sam answered any and all questions we had. He said we could try out any mattress we wanted and showed us the model that was the softest since that was the one we were specifically looking for. He let us try out the mattresses and we eventually purchased the Luxe Adept Soft King Size TempurPedic model. The great thing with Sam was that he never tried to haggle us into buying the most expensive mattress or try to upsell us with anything that we didn’t need or didn’t come in for. We felt no pressure for him. We asked him questions, told him what we were looking for (the softest one) and he really listened to us. We asked about a base for the mattress and he explained the different ones they had. Sam showed us the Tempur-Ergo 2.0 Adjustable base where it moves the mattress in such a way that you can elevate your upper body and your legs. It also had a feature where the mattress vibrated. We tested it and fell in love with it so we bought that too. At the end, Sam explained the run-down with us so there was no misunderstandings or confusion. He itemized all the items we purchased, confirmed each of their prices so there were no “surprise fees”, explained the warranties and how to register for the warranty. Next, he checked for availability and told us everything was in stock and that they could deliver everything the very next day! So fast! They would even take our old mattress so we wouldn’t have to dispose of it ourselves. If you are looking to buy mattresses, I recommend this Mattress Firm at 2515 Vista Way in Oceanside. Ask for Sam and he will help you with anything you need. Thank you! We can’t wait for our new TempurPedic to arrive!

<text>Met the nicest sales person today at mattress firm. She was very knowledgeable and very nice. She loves the company she works for. We talked about the coronavirus situation and even though she went on unemployment for awhile she continued to say her company does everything right for their employees. It wasn’t a phony “ I love my company “ either. Very sincere. She was just a very nice single girl who also was in the reserves and worked for mattress firm.

I went to 4 different stores to find a mattress and found myself very confused. It was not until I went into the Mattress Firm store in Oceanside and was lucky to get Kenneth Johnson to help me find the right mattress and base at a great price. I am very happy with the service I received. Jeanine</Review>

<gmapID>0x80dc718e6307fd7f:0x88f3c17c8fef0f4c<//gmapID><Text>I had been to another furniture store, placed a big order, spending more than I had intended to. I woke up that night in anxiety because I felt I had gotten more than I really needed or wanted. I cancelled the order before it shipped. When I walked into Mattress Firm, I was apprehensive, but needed a new mattress. Kenneth J. took the time with me that I needed. He didn't "oversell" me. He went through all the options with me and educated me on the mattress choices. When I left, I didn't have that icky feeling of having been shamboozled. I am comfortable and at peace with my purchase and am looking forward to many good night's sleep!</Text></record>

The establishment and the workers provided much information needed to help get us started, it was a very big help to us. I would not have known any of the tips that they let us know, about the usage of different beds, but with that we were guided in a better direction.<//Text>

Timothy was really helpful when it came to finding us the right mattress. We explained some of our issues and he knew exactly what direction to lead us in. He let us test out so many mattresses and allowed us to take our time. He was super friendly and made the experience way easier than I thought it would be!< /Review>

After sleeping on an old, too small, mattress on the floor for way too many years, I finally decided enough was enough. A family member of mine recommended Jennifer Hitchcock, and honestly, I could not have had a better person helping and guiding me through this process. Jennifer was so helpful, and I trusted her to do all the hard work of the big purchase and she made it as convenient as possible, not to mention she helped me get a great deal. Buying a new bed is a big decision and Jennifer helped us pick the mattress and adjustable base of our dreams. I am so happy with this experience, and cannot recommend Jennifer more.< /Text>

<Review>I am somebody who dreads shopping with a passion but with that being said, I am somebody who regards their health and physical condition with the upmost priority. Needless to say I knew I was in for it when I needed to look for a new bed. I walked into Mattress Firm and  from the second Jennifer approached me I felt at ease;  immediately my anxiousness about landing this purchase was relieved. She made me feel like she had all the time in the world for me. She was extremely knowledgeable, and it helped so much that she was able to translate all of her technical jargon into layman’s terms.  I can’t tell you how many times somebody in sales has tried to rattle off technical terms etc. as to sound professional yet I end up leaving there feeling clueless. I SO appreciated that Jennifer cared enough to make sure I understood what she was saying, and not just intimidate me into a sale. I comprehended the ins and outs of the purchase I was making- which is something I NEEDED to feel secure about considering the investment I was making. I am the proud new owner of a Legends Windward Luxury Firm on an adjustable base, and let me just say I feel like a Queen these days! I absolutely love going to bed. The massage feature is everything, the light under my bed creates a beautiful ambiance, and I honestly feel like getting this adjustable base upgraded the look and feel of my place so much. I wish I would have met Jennifer sooner- I LOVED my experience with her, and at this Mattress Firm in general.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< review>
After sleeping on our old mattress of 20+ years, my wife and I decided to shop for a new mattress and an adjustable frame.  Jennifer took time and showed us the latest mattresses and adjustable bed frames, and many available options to meet our needs.  She was great to work with.  We made a great purchase and are very happy with our choice.  We recommend Jennifer and and Mattress Firm.  You won't be disappointed.</review>

Merril wasn't pushy in the least and yet educated me and allowed me all the time I needed, which wasn't much once I tried a few mattresses out. I not only was extremely pleased with the comfort, but with the vibe of the store too. Merril was friendly without seeming like a salesperson, and Tim too. I got exactly what I wanted, pillows and bed cover too! I was worried about the whole thing yet it was a great experience!< /Review><user>107321155950023643305< /user></record>

My fiancee and I had just moved and needed a mattress asap, so we stopped here before anywhere else. Fortunately, with Jennifer's help, we were able to quickly find what we needed. The whole process took less than 10 minutes, and the price was very reasonable. Jennifer went above and beyond to say the least.< /text>

Jennifer was absolutely wonderful, and extremely helpful. She was very personable, very friendly from the second I walked in, to the second I left. Would recommend her to anyone and everyone. Left today very happy with my purchase, and wouldn’t have done it with anyone else. I would give her 10 stars if possible.<//Review>

Jay! I've never had someone help me that completely put you over them. I was not excited about purchasing a new mattress. Jay took all the negative out of that experience. He worked with your budget to get you the best mattress for you. Was anything but pushy. His knowledge on every mattress was mind blowing. I guess I should be talking about the mattress but it was not the best attribute to Mattress Firm. If you are purchasing a new mattress I beyond highly recommend Jay and Mattress Firm. Great experience! Next day delivery!</review>

My Wife and I came in the other day to try out some beds to see what we liked and had no real intention in buying day of, but with Will's help, we found our perfect bed in less than an hour! Will was so helpful and patient while he tried to help us figure out what we liked best and gave us many options to choose from.

Financing was a breeze as well, as he helped us out the whole time and even thought of options to help us cut down costs a little. He was very knowledgeable and confident that made me feel welcome from the very start, and refrained from using a spiel or script for help, but tailored the entire interaction to our habits and us personally.

Delivery was also very easy, as the men were in and out with my old mattress in about 10 minutes, and I didn't have to do any heavy lifting at all! Overall this was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. Thanks!< /Text>

I went in looking for a bed because of back problems and I found the perfect one, the store manager Jennifer is great! With any little thing they will accommodate you to make sure your experience with them is 100%. I  reccomend to shop here for your bed needs, as my experience with them was great!< /Text>

<Review>I recently bought a mattress online and it was awful, after 100 days of backpain returned it and went to Mattress Firm. The salesperson, Merril, was amazing and helped me find the right mattress with no hassle. It was great.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Its a beautiful veiw and staff was delightful.  Thats about all the positive I have to share. The acustics are horrendous and for this reason, I would suggest going to a differnt venue if you want to enjoy your favorite band and actually hear the amazing music they produce.<//Text>< username>

I ordered for pick up from the app and I received the saddest sandwich. Missing ingredients i asked for (cheese and black olives) the ingredients i did receive was little to none. It was the emptiest saddest sandwich I've ever gotten at a subway. I also ask for extra mayo. Barely any mayo. The customer service was a bit rude but it didn't bother me much. I just want my sandwich done right.</text>

Very disappointed with two female employees, they were talking in their language and giggling to each other while they were serving the customers. I am sure probably saying something funny about the customer. My sandwich was so soggy because she rushed to do  with so much of source. This is not the first time they talked to each other in Punjabi. Ladies you can talk in your language but not when serving customers.<//Review>

it never closes at the right time, on the website it says 9pm on the door it says 10 pm, but there were times when I arrived at 8 and the girl didn't answer me because she said it was already closed ...</review>

Placed a pick up order and requested my bread toasted with swiss cheese. The bread was not toasted and no cheese. I also ordered a raspberry cheesecake cookie and received chocolate chip. When I went to pick it up it was just slapped on the counter. I know it's not the biggest deal in the world but it would be nice to receive what you paid for.<//Review>

< Review>
There was a girl in yellow shirt today, really worst service ever , I swear . She just threw the stuff into my subway and didn’t knew how to pack up even .
Don’t visit this place . She needs to learn to make subway before making faces on customer.</Review>

<Text>Ordered chicken ceacer wrap,they put only one scoop of chicken on wrap when your paying for two scoops. All other Subways put two scoops.  They charge the same price. Don't buy from this Subway they are a rip off. I said if you don't make it the same as the other Subways then keep it. I walked out and went to different Subway, the second store put two scoops.<//Text>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><review>Horrible customer service . Nikki a worker at this location was absolutely not helpful at all . She mocked me and my girlfriend under her breath as we simply just ordered our sandwiches. As if we were asking for something unreasonable, when my most complicated request was just a bit more sauce on my sandwich. Nikki has left a horrible taste in my mouth with this experience at this location. She was mean unprofessional and simply should not be able to serve people with such negativity directed at the customer.< /review>< rating>

Oof, why do I keep coming here, that's it, never again!  They never understand what I'm saying AND I even tried telling them in Urdu/Hindi, I'm bilingual, still never understand...  So getting a sandwhich you want is about a 20 minute process, they could atleast act like they want to help/customer service me when I walk in!  Latest sandwhich fail: i ordered the current promotional "chicken parmasean" sandwhich, simple enough, chicken cheese marinara... She bakes my sandwhich and then asks what kind of mustard I want, I replied I want it like the picture haha and she forgot the cheese, so she puts cheese on and then asks honey mustard? I said nooo I would like marinara, she's like oh fine, gets a spoonful of marina from the meatball dish and pours it on, I say thats it, pay and sit down, they ring me up for a meal, just ordered th sandwhich, finally sit down after getting refunded and repurchasing and lo and behold, the marinara is freezing cold, the dish they keep it in isn't even warm!!?! Gotta be a health hazard, I'm guessing it should've been warm atleast and then they bake my sandwhich to heat up the sauce... Well I go back up and they refuse to make me a new sandwhich WTF!? You poured cold sauce on my toasted sandwhich, defeating the purpose of a warm sandwhich hahaha this franchise is ridiculous do NOT come to this location!!</Text>

Staff was amazing !!! I had gone to a previous usps because they’re Were so rude to me and lied to me about their pricing because they were lazy and unprofessional they didn’t want to help me send my package to Canada. I decided to leave and come to the post office in Gardena & to my surprise they were so nice help me, answered all my questions, gave me the best shipping rate & help me package my box. I am forever grateful! Thank you Staff< /text>

If I could give it a 0 I would. For whatever reason they’re able to put my mail I the mailbox but they can’t deliver my package to my door for the past two days. It’s total bs. I’m sure the regular postal worker who deliver to my apartment complex is off because it’s usually her replacements who don’t deliver. It’s very upsetting that they can get way with not doing their job!< /Text>

<review>This postal office is a complete joke. I had order three items from ebay at the same time. Each item was coming a different state and country. The one that USPS was responsible for was coming from this county of Los Angeles. It was supposed to be delivered on April 2nd 2020. Its April 9 still haven't received and the excuse was "no access" which is BS because its an auto shop with a large gate thats wide open during hours. I had to wait until today to escalate to superviser to actually do something about it and she didn't it well.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This post office is horrible, the worst service. Is been 3 different occasions were they send me emails saying they tempted to deliver but sorry we missed you. Total LIE. they  never try to delivery out, just excuses. I don't understand why they are in business if they are not prepared or willing to help (do their job). Horrible service, unfortunately Amazon is shipping through them. Hopefully everyone can share their experience with this business whether is good or bad so someone can take over to fix this horrible service.<//review>

<text>One if the worst post office I've ever had to visit. My package was sent here by accident instead of my local post office. My tracking number said my package was here ready for pick up I called and said if I can pick it up. They said even though it was sent there by mistake if  didn't mind I could go pick it up. I drove the 15 miles (I needed the package that day if not I wouldn't have cared) only to be told by the rudest man ever that my package wasn't there he didn't even bother looking in the back or checking my tracking number or name. he just said he knew my package wasn't here and that it would be a waste of time to check. Worst customer service ever.< /text><Response>None< /Response>< user>

They lose everything and don’t take responsibility. Workers are super rude. They owe me $200 for items lost. This isn’t our first rodeo, so now I’m finally writing a review because I’ve never lost mail until I moved to Gardena and they became my local post office.< /text>

It wasn't really a bad experience. Sure the lines are long at times and the tellers might be inexperienced, but the 5 or so times I've been there the employees have been nice and quick when it came to my packages. One time the kind Asian lady even spent time looking for a package that I didn't pick up for ages but managed to find it.</text>

This post office gets pretty crowded and they usually one have 2-3 tellers on at a time. Sometimes the wait lines can be over 30 minutes. The parking lot is pretty small, so there can be a line of cars out the lot at certain peak times.

Although, for what it's worth and all the down sides, this post office is not entirely bad (hence the "3" rating).</review>

A few years back they didn't even bother to knock at the door and just left a slip in the mailbox while i was home all day. Another thing to note is that i felt discriminated as when i paid here once with a card, they asked me for my ID while the guy in front of me of difference race was not asked for an ID. That really felt disrespectful and angered.
Now as an eBay seller i strongly hate coming here as they won't give me an acceptance scan without a SCAN paper where as the USPS in Inglewood the clerk was more than glad to give me an acceptance scan to all packages without hesitation. Oh yeah, and they won't even pick up my packages that i had schedules for pick up and then sent me an email saying the scheduled pick up was successful.< /Review>< pics>

I truly do wish there was a negative star available for the rating.  One of the worst post office I have ever been to.  Wrong tracking information was provided.  No attempted delivery was made and no notice was left even though it says it did on the tracking information.  So, I had to go down to this post office in person to find out what's going on,  but their attitude towards helping to solve the problem was just horrible.  They will never admit their faults.  Worst of all, while waiting at the window I overheard two old man working there making fun of this old granny who didn't speaking English very well.   It was a horrible experience.  Plus, they never pick up their phone except for their automated answering system saying "Good Afternoon x 2, Good Bye." even though they say the customer service hours are from 8am to 5pm .  If you have a problem you will have to go down there in person.</Text>

This by far is the worst post office I've had to use.  They leave a pick up slip and when I go to try to pick it up my package is missing.  It took them a week to find my package.   This is after they tried telling me that it was delivered to me already.  I've now requested 3 mail holds and each time they did not hold my mail.  Sometimes they don't even leave a slip to tell you a package is waiting for you.  It's just terrible.  I've sent mail from there that goes to a PO Box that is there that was misplaced for a month.  How do you lose mail that is going to a PO Box at that facility?  The service there is just terrible.  I've tried filing  5 complaints so far but nothing ever changes.<//text>

Lol check this places rating compared to other post office nearby. I guess I am not alone with this. I been here a lot since I do internet business and I can confirm that except for old Asian lady that works there, people are authoritative. As for knowledge, there is old man seating in the right that seems to know a lot(I mean, at least he is knowledgeable..?) but again, except for those few.... They just run around for help and try to not work as possible.

Since it is a random chance you get them, I try to stay away even though I have to make few more miles of driving.< /text>

They have placed a card in my box letting me know I had a package there. When I went to retrieve it, they couldn't find it.  They assured me someone would call me. They didnt. A week later, the package was there. Another package was placed in someone else's box. The guy working the window just shrugged and said they have new people who keep making mistakes and lots of people "whine and complain." Judging by the comments, this is an ongoing problem and nothing is being done to fix it. My next step is going higher.<//review>

WAOW!!!! EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! My husband were in and out.  As I was filling out some envelopes I heard about 3 different voices of clerks calling customers so they can be helped.  Im impress with this US Post Office, the lady who helped us was Asian, very helpful, friendly and fast. I wish the employees at my Post Office in Inglewood were friendly and had more than one clerk.</Review>

Very disappointed with their customer service.  I was suppose to get a shipment at my job and they never attempted to deliver but when track the package it said no one was available.  So then I pick up the package at the location and the supervisor or manager sitting in the back didn't even have anything for me to upload 4 heavy packages and didn't even want to help.  Never going their again.  Also the place is dirty..looks like if they were going to close it down.< /text>

This post office is known for losing packages, lack of customer service and never answering the phone. They couldn't find my package after I was left a notice to specifically pick it up from their office and the only advice I was given was to wait another day when it was guaranteed to be delivered 4 days ago smh complete waste of time< /Review>

This post office has a dysfunctional automated telephone system that has prohibited me from getting in contact with any physical being. This is extremely frustrating for me, as I can imagine it is for others if they are experiencing the same issue. I sincerely hope this problem is resolved for those residing within the area.</Text>

I Minority base crowd, Limited parking spaces with only 20 parking spots available,  only one entrance and one exit, limited parking outside,  vintage and historical feel. Plexiglass paneling over the counter, wheelchair accessible, and on top of all that the customer service here is slow I mean very slow. Prepared to wait a minimum of 30 minutes to be helped if you are to stop by at this location. Having said all of that the customer services a bit questionable to say the least. And the entire environment feels dingy.</text>

Long lines and employees that don't care. Parking is a hassle specially if you driving East on Redondo Beach. Very limited parking spaces. They used to have a drive through drop off mail box and they removed it. Now everyone needs to find parking and go inside to drop off the mail. Genius</Text>

Ordered something on Amazon and USPS Gardena was supposed to ship it today by 8pm it's 8:37pm and I got an email stating my address is incorrect. I bet the delivery person Didn't even look because last week i ordered a watch and got same day shipping and it was delivered at my front door yet usps struggled to even look for my place since my package wasn't delivered and on top of that the costumer service is awful i tried calling and no one picked up i got a monitor call and it was giving me a hard time getting my tracker number. Next time i order something online ill make sure USPS isn't the one delivering.< /Review>

As I'm tracking it the day it is to be delivered I noticed they are returning the package to the supplier because the address is insufficient.  Now they have been delivering packages to my address for years and now the address isn't correct.  We CONSTANTLY get the someone else's mail (almost on a weekly basis). Sometimes, the person's mail is clearly not on this street.   The package never even got out of the Post Office to try to deliver it.    They've delivered mail enough times to know where the package should have been dropped off.

I agree with others that when you call the actual office, no one answers the phone.  This is VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /text>< pictures>

This is one of the worst Post Offices for customer service. It took 3 months to return a package to me. Art, the supervisor, admitted it was because someone "failed" to cross out the wrong address. I was asking for the package to be re-sent at no cost since it was due to "their" mistake that the package was in limbo. Art replied that he would not accept responsibility for the mistake and he controls the money and would charge me again to send the package that they played ping pong with for 3 months.  Yuk, bad service.</Text>

<Text>As with most reviewers, I would love to leave negative stars. Constantly having carriers fraudulantly say that there was an "attempt to deliver package" when all members of household are home & then state that there was a "notice left". LIES! This is the 5th occurrence in a couple of months. I have called the USPS perverbial # & have complained at every instance. Someone from the local office leaves me a voicemail to address said complaint, leaves a contact # that has a greeting  & then automatically hangs up.

FYI - I just wanted to say that when my regular postman (shout out & props to ED!) is on duty, this NEVER occurs. Only when he is off.

As I have done research while waiting to speak to a USPS rep for a redelivery attempt, it seems like you can call the Post Master General & file a complaint as these workers are stating untruths whilst on the clock.

I would complain in person but judging from the other reviews I would probably would just "go postal" if some charlatan talked to me in a condescending tone. I can imagine the inferiority complex that rears it's ugly head when an incompetent employee is faced with the fact that a machine could do a better job than they. #dronesfordeliveries</Text>< pics>

I came home (condo) this afternoon and went to the mailbox to check my mail. To my astonishment, entire wall of mailboxes were left open for anyone to steal mails what are someone else. I tried to contact local post office (Gardena PO on 1455 W. RBB), and of course, no one answers.

This post office employees are lazy as well; package that was supposedly delivered won't get delivered because they don't want bother looking for the unit, rather, they send it right back to a vendor. This is the most terrible post office I ever encountered in my life.

Don't even try to contact manager or supervisor, they are just as bad. You would get better satisfaction talking to the wall.<//review>

<review>THE GARDENA USPS IS THE WORST ONE I'VE DEALT WITH SO FAR. WE OWN A BUSINESS IN GARDENA AND THEY CONTINUALLY DELIVER MAIL LATE OR NOT AT ALL. WHEN I CALL THE USPS OFFICE, NO ONE ANSWERS. WHEN ONE OF THE MAIL WOMEN COME TO DELIVER MAIL, SHE IS TALKING ON THE PHONE AND CONTINUES TALKING ON THE PHONE WHILE SHE HANDS ME MY PACK OF MAIL. THIS IS THE SECOND DAY IN A ROW THAT THEY'VE MISSED THE MAIL. HOW CAN OUR BUSINESS GET OUR CHECK PAYMENTS? HOW CAN I MEET PAYROLL?</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Call the authorities. Period. Thats the only way I see fit to deal with this post office. Bring the police with you and maybe they'll get their act together. If I could give this place no stars or even negative stars trust me, I would. They're rude, starting at the top with the supervisor, all the way down to the employees. They don't care. They lost a package that I had sent to someone & then told them that they dont know where the package is and they'll reach them when they find it. This makes absolutely NO SENSE. and to top it all off, nobody wants to do their job. Its gotten to the point where the dont want to do something as simple as picking up the phone. They have an intro play, followed by an automated voice that tells you they're connecting you to a representative & then the "representative" gets on the phone only to tell you that this is gardena post office and then the automated voice comes back and says goodbye. I realized that the "representative" was just a recorded message. I mean, how careless & irresponsible can a GOVERMENT FACILITY be? As I said before, I've been experiencing these issues with them for 4-5 days now. If my friend & I do not receive real service soon I will not hesitate to get the police involved since all they want to do is sit around & collect a check.<//Review>

I own a mail order business requiring daily deliveries, pickups and occasional visits to the post office.  As my company has grown over the years I have moved it from city to city.  The Gardena Post Office is now the 5th PO I have worked with.

This is the worst PO by a long shot.  Although the people working the windows and deliveries are perfectly nice people they are totally mismanaged.  For some reason that escapes me there are 5! different people in that office with the title "Postmaster".  Additionally, there are managers and supervisors.  I'm not sure if there are actually any official workers.  This all indicates that there are way too many chiefs and far too few indians.

The delivery/pick-up people are so poorly managed that they frequently simply skip us when they are running behind.  When you go to the post office the lines are always incredibly long.  Picking up a package at the PO is always a half-day task because they can never find anything in the back in a timely manner.

Oh yes, and try phoning them sometime.  They almost never answer the phone.  If you are wondering why, it is because the person responsible for answering the phone is also the main window clerk.  Unfortunately, the window and the phone are about a 2-3 minute fast walk apart from each other.  And the phone cannot be heard from the window area.  Another example of bad management.

As a business owner I know that when an operation like the Gardena PO is not working properly it is typically the fault of management. If I was asked to take over the management of this office I would keep almost all of the people and dump every one of the so-called managers, supervisors and postmasters.< /text>

<Review>If i could give this place negative 5 stars i most definitely would, i was approached by a rude unhelpful man..so i walked away and asked a lady at the counter for help but she was irratable and rude..so i left without getting my package sent out.

<review>I hate this office so much. I've been tracking a package since Feb 26, 2015 and it said they tried to deliver that day but no one was home. So it said for me to pick up. I went the next day and they said it was going to be delivered that day (feb27) well I didn't get anything, so I went the next day (feb28) and they had me waiting atleast 1hr and they didn't find anything again. So i left my info so they can notify me when it's available. I went again the next day (Feb 29) and once again they didn't have anything they said it's in the office somewhere but they just didn't know where.. i was tired of going so i waited to talk to a supervisor and no one came to me, so the employee told me to leave a not with my info. Well i just got an email saying that my package was unclaimed which means that I never went to claim for it. So now I'm left with no package. I'm so mad. I really don't recommend going to this post office. It sucks so bad. The workers are lazy and hard to understand what they are saying. They are also rude. Don't waste your time coming here.<//review><name>Tiffany Sanchez< /name>< GmapID>

<Review>I have a package that was delivered but the business was closed so they are currently holding it at this post office, it's been two days and they are still holding it and haven't redelivered. I have been trying to call them for 2 hours and they keep saying "Gardena Post office customer service" twice and then hanging up. It's clearly automated but there is no option to speak to anyone.<//Review><user_id>112008295596305881810</user_id>< username>

I went to a window just to ask a question and they sent me to ask In line they did not want to attend to me, besides that they were very racist with me and they did not speak Spanish either and maybe that is why they treated me this way ... but that it is not another race because they even put me aside ... I had to put a star because otherwise I could not have put my comment ... this can not continue like this ... I am very angry 😠😠 ..

Food was good just took forever. Cashier was have trouble with the system and then she finally got a manager to help...but the manager should have heard the limit times alarm going off and went to see why it was taking so long for orders to go out!< /text>

This Jack in the Box is the best one I've ever been too! I don't usually get fast food not a fan of it. But sometimes you just have to when you're running around. And I was coming back from San Francisco and I specifically waited till I got to Livermore to go to this Jack in the Box because I know the service is always great and the food is always fresh and hot and I actually like it LOL. My favorite is the chicken fajita pita!</Review>

Kinda slow but fast on weekdays.  One employee wasn't so helpful kept ignoring my orders and I noticed he didn't wash his hands when preparing my food, he has great customer connection skills but I wouldn't want some one handling my food while not having hands cleaned. It's kinda odd. Not only he always has an attitude when I come through drive thru... is it just me or any1 get this too?..<//Text>

Supposed to open at 6 am but apparently they open when they want to. The drive thru is up and running but the dining area has to wait. Waited outside for 10 minutes and left because there was no one opening up. This was not the first time this happened.</Review>

<text>Food was good but service was lacking. Only two employees, and drive through got priority (I was eating inside).  This was at a little before 7pm on Friday, and though I was the only one in the dining area, it took a while to get my order taken and also get my food.  Probably would have been fine if they had one or two more workers, but too much for just the two - one taking drive through orders and packing them with drinks, the other in back cooking, so no one taking care of walk-in customers.  Can't imagine if had actually been busy.</text>< Gmap_id>

Clean and friendly. It was rather odd, we ordered two orders of curly fries and they placed them on a community tray. While we were eating together we really didn't know each other and were not sharing a meal/food. This was not okay but you were forced to make the best of it. When the other person is taking the curly fry you had your eye on and is on the side closest to you. In your head your are thinking oh well there goes not wanting to make a scene. But why didn't they just give us each our own order as we ordered it????

Not a fan of being forced to share my food. Please let me decide how and when I share thank you!

Hint, order your food to go, even if you are eating there if you are ordering in a group!< /text>

This location is hit or miss, but it still beats the heck out of the location on N. Livermore! The food at this location is pretty consistent, but sometimes not as good as it could be. Most orders in drive- thru are correct & more times than not, staff is nice, friendly & helpful. But like I said, there's times when service is less than pleasant, but it's been a while, so hopefully they've solved whatever issue they were having. For the most part we like this place & hands down recommend THIS JACK over the other locations in town.< /Text>

Had the ultimate cheeseburger, no bacon.  Is slightly different than I remember but still tasty.  Love their soda machine which gives you countless choices.</text>

I ordered a sourdough jack and the Patty looked over cooked. The cheese looked like it was slapped on there and wasn't melted. I wasn't pleased with my sandwich. After a few attempts of repouring our soft drinks, It tasted all right. Given more or less carbonation. The cashier looked like she did not like her job. She didn't even smile. Maybe we caught this spot on a bad day. Otherwise we usually like jack in the box.< /Review>

Have been visiting this Jack In The Box for years! Food is consistently good & I have to give props to the employees! Especially the crews that work the late night shift!
On the rare occasion that the order is wrong, (although to be fair, it's usually something minor, like forgotten fries or drink.) They immediately rectify the issue, no questions asked!

So yes, tasty late night munchie stop, nice folks, good place!< /Text>

So then I go to take a drink of my Sprite and It taste like mold. I told the lady at the drive thru they need to clean there soda dispenser and she just  said o k... did not even bother to ask if I would like another soda or something else. # customer service.

I wish we had a Jack in the Box back home!  Those chorizo fries were awesome...!!!   But of course I had to add my hot sauce 😎

If I can give this JACK IN THE BOX A -1 TODAY I WOULD...for no apparent reason they were closed down... just out of the blue...no notice!! This is my morning daily stop starts
off my whole day.... Now without it I'm going to be hungry it's only going to lead to grumpiness... ruined my whole day....Every time I go to one that says 24/7 they end up being closed and always have a garbage can in their driveway That's not 24/7 people!<//Review>

<Text>Ordered my food and it took awhile. I will say while sitting at the window waiting for mine and my coworkers order, i watched as the 2 male clerks walked around waiting on food to fill the bags. One thing i have learned abour this place is the fact that employees touch money, credit cards and their headsets a lot. Then like nothing with those dirty hands (i have NEVER seen an employee wash their hands or use sanitizer or wear gloves ) and no gloves, shovel the fries in the fry holder and then put them in your bag. Gross.... this is exactly why i dont eat their food. A soda or something else to drink is all i get from here. Very unsanitary🤢< /Text>< pictures>

Best Jack in the Box drive thru interaction ever. Shaka is the most amazing drive thru guy I have ever encountered. He was so awesome. Too bad I'm from out of town or I'd come here every single day.<//Review>

Your food may taste better if you had your franchise's change the oil daily and if your food wasn't so greasy

The staff is friendly. And the lobby was nice clean and neat.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm a regular coustmer, I come to this jack in the box atleast 3 days out the week before work. I always get my usual. 21 no cheese! This morning I got my order (with cheese) and that's ok I get it, it happenes! But my biggest issue is that the cashier was high. Young red head girl was High out her mind she did not speak clearly to me and I could smell weed from my side of the window.  I'm so dissatisfied. I guess this is what we expect from these young adults now a days rite? I work to far to come back to get my order done again. It upsets me that Jack even allowed her to work in those conditions. Well Hopefully she's sober next time so I can get my order done correctly!</Review>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) The restaurant is clean I like you they serve you well 😊 what I like about this place is that they have coffee outside and you serve yourself as many times as you want and in other fast food restaurants they don't give you more coffee ... ☹️☹️☹️☹️
